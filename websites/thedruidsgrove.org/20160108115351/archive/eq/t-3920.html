<br />
So far I'm pleased with how it is going. I really hope I'm able to be pleased at its final outcome.<br />
<br />
Will begin to share with the first installment here.<br />
<br />
I have 3 written so far ;)<br />

<br />
&quot;I Have Crossed The Great Divide&quot;<br />
<br />
When I was very young and hale, <br />
I heard a weary traveler's tale<br />
A savage, brisk and ruthless land<br />
He spoke of with a trembling hand.<br />
<br />
He entered the pub, worn and thin<br />
and took up a chair near the fire within.<br />
&quot;Where have you been?&quot; I asked the man<br />
and he grew silent for quite a span.<br />
<br />
Finally gazing up, his eyes morose<br />
he waved a hand, for me to move close.<br />
As I shuffled my stool close to his side,<br />
he rasped, &quot;I have crossed the Great Divide.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me of this land!&quot; I nearly shouted with glee<br />
for a great tale of adventure I thought to foresee.<br />
&quot;Please tell me this tale,&quot; I did again entreat<br />
He sighed and nodded, as if in defeat.<br />
<br />
In his rolling voice of baritone rumble<br />
He told his story with never a fumble.<br />
&quot;A wondrous land is this,&quot; he did confide<br />
And he began to tell of the Great Divide.<br />
<br />
Scattered trees with crystal branches frozen<br />
no trace of a path man's foot had chosen;<br />
Skies the sapphire blue of a maiden's eye<br />
Made home to the sun to glorify<br />
<br />
One foot set forward, he began his pace <br />
the snowflakes whispering across his face.<br />
the traveler kept warm along his trail<br />
by his brisk, steady trot, and flask of ale.<br />
<br />
But tragedy and pain would begin one night<br />
when a blizzard howled in to rend and smite.<br />
In the ruthless, pelting snow he huddled<br />
His normal keen senses attacked and muddled.<br />
<br />
Late in the night, his ears were assailed<br />
by the hungry howls of many wolves wailed.<br />
Their song grew louder as they drew closer yet <br />
and despite the frigid chill, he began to sweat.<br />
<br />
In desperation the traveler struggled to run<br />
stumbling blindly, his nerves undone.<br />
His muscles weary under the storm's onslaught,<br />
he felt final defeat, and slowed his trot.<br />
<br />
Blood red eyes gleamed through the haze<br />
and the traveler stood still, caught in a daze.<br />
Suddenly he spotted through the storm's thick mire,<br />
what looked like the flicker of a distant fire.<br />
<br />
The strength of new hope flooded into his soul<br />
and he struggled up the side of a snowy knoll.<br />
To his wonder the torch danced atop a huge wall<br />
behind which a fortress stood unbelievably tall.<br />
<br />
Glancing back in the night, he saw the wolves were gone<br />
and he began to scale the wall, towards the torch thereupon.<br />
As he settled close to the flame to warm his blood<br />
He suddenly heard a tremendous thud.<br />
<br />
To his newfound horror and astonished awe<br />
he saw a huge giant as it gave deep guffaw.<br />
Another voice rumbled out in a terrifying bass<br />
and the first giant raised up an immense mace.<br />
<br />
The two glared at each other, in an apparent gauge<br />
and finally one stormed off in a frustrated rage.<br />
Realizing he had not yet been found out<br />
He slipped in a small crevice, and there he hid out.<br />
<br />
With exhaustion he could no longer fight, <br />
he slept the rest of that fitful night.<br />
He awoke at dawn, and with urgent care<br />
He silently slipped away from there.<br />
<br />
