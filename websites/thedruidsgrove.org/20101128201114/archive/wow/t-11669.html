Think of any questions you may have and post them and you will definately get responses.<br />
<br />
 How are you wanting to play the Druid? Feral, Balance, or resto? Knowing that will help people give you some ideas. I think that for leveling Feral is the most efficient however Balance works also, just depends on your play style. Druids have alot of different tools and to be effective you need to use them all, so take some time and look at each talent and skill and then bring any questions here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauna</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here is what ive noticed so far... my dire bear from is kinda lsow killing things solo, however if i root and rot (everquest term) maybe throw a starfire and awrath at them they get to me with about half of their hp then i just maul em a few times... am i close in the strategy?<br />
<br />
and to answer the question, feral. a few guild mates ( no one in guild is a druid btw, im highest level in guild) told me to try feral, they heard it was the best for leveling... so far no complaints. however, my question is what are the limits that a dire bear form can do... even level elites? or no? ifyes what strategy is recommended? if not whats the highest level mob i can take solo? strat for that? im just getting a feel on how to play i mean any gump can throw down a spell or two, i want to be effective... ive played with the spells, first to help power level someone, then tried soloing in STV. fun but i know i can go faster. maybe my gear. ill check on the gear later tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the gist of it:<br />
<br />
Cat form = dps.  <br />
Bear form = tank<br />
Caster form = healer (or nuker i suppose)<br />
Cheeta form = running away<br />
<br />
Shift a lot.  Shifting is like changing aspects as a hunter.  Shifting removes movement imparing effects, and when shifted, you are immune to polymorph.  Get used to shifting in and out of forms.  Druids that stay in one form all the time (i.e. the I'm ONLY cat dps druid people) are bad druids.  <br />
<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Most fights you will be in cat form.  Start out prowling (stealthing).  You should be familiar with cat form stealth style attacks from playing a rogue.  Build some combo points with claw and rake, then Ferocious Bite (eviscerate) if they are squishy or rip if they have lots of armor (similar in idea to garrotte - DoT bleed).<br />
<br />
If you get multiple mobs, go to bear to increase your armor and health, hit demoralizing roar (to reduce their attack power) then sit back and just maul things to death.  You won't take much damage in bear.<br />
<br />
If you are healing, the main heals you want to use are Healing Touch (direct heal with a 3.5sec cast time, 3 with the Naturalist talent in resto) and rejuvination (insta cast HoT).  These are the most mana efficient.  Regrowth is a good heal for emergency situations (partial direct heal, partial hot), though it is pretty mana inefficient, so for any prolonged healing (instancing), use HT and rejuv.  <br />
<br />
Like Trix said, just try out all the different spells.  You have 2 reasonably high level toons, I'm sure you have an understanding of game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that works.  Bear is super slow to kill things, but mitigates damage well.  So anything you can do to decrease the amount of damage done in bear form is helpful.  The best strat is to start in cat, as cat dps &gt; casting dps if you are feral.  Get to love your cat.<br />
<br />
what are the limits that a dire bear form can do... even level elites? or no? ifyes what strategy is recommended? if not whats the highest level mob i can take solo? strat for that? im just getting a feel on how to play i mean any gump can throw down a spell or two, i want to be effective... ive played with the spells, first to help power level someone, then tried soloing in STV. fun but i know i can go faster. maybe my gear. ill check on the gear later tho.<br />
<br />
Bear can take whatever it wants within reason.  As you know, I'm sure, some same level elites are a lot tougher than others.  <br />
<br />
Bear tips:<br />
In bear,essentially the only attack you have is maul at that lvl.  Spam that.  Use swipe if you have multiple targets.  If not, don't.  If you have feral faerie fire, make sure that is on a target.  Use demoralizing roar.  Spec into brutal impact in feral.  That'll increase the duration of your bear stun, thus increasing your survivability.  Save your bash (stun) until you are at about 15 - 20% health, then bash, shift out, and Heal yourself to full, and shift back to bear with one, maybe two HoT's ticking on yourself.  I always laugh when I see druids bash when they don't need to shift out and heal.  If you are Tauren, you have War Stomp, which gives you another chance to shift out and stun / heal yourself <br />
<br />
Again, Bear killing is slow and boring.  Play your druid like a modified rogue (cat form) without the stuns, and if things get hairy, switch to bear to soak up damage.<br />
<br />
The beauty of a druid is that it really never gets boring.  If you get tired of killing things as a cat (most efficient), you can go to bear and pull 3 or 4 mobs, and kill them all at once, or you can root / nuke mobs to death to mix things up.<br />
<br />
Edit:  This is what a good all around feral build at that level will look like:<br />
http://www.worldofwar.se/talents/talents.php?class=druid&amp;template=undefinedB5undefinedM3undefinedL2undefine  dJ2undefinedI1undefinedH3undefinedF3undefinedE2und  efinedD2undefinedC1undefinedB1undefinedA5undefined  x1<br />
<br />
I'd put the next 11 into Resto (feral talents in resto): 5 points into Furor, then the 5 after that into Naturalist, then 1 in Omen of Clarity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauna</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aaah ok stun shift heal shift, NICE!!! didnt know that one. <br />
<br />
hmm ill have to take a look at my spec later on when iget to the house, ill take a look at those next 11 points too, however your link didnt come up for some reason. <br />
<br />
but yeah im liking druid little by little, loving the feral spec tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">u can also decide to go Balance spec, and nuke stuff down. u just root the mob, drop an insect swarm, and spam wrath. if root breaks, recast it and spam wrath again. if the mob is about to die, and root breaks, just take the hits and kill it with wrath.<br />
<br />
u should have the Balance talent to lower wrath pushback by like 70%, to avoid cast delays. it's kinda boring imho, so i chose to level as feral.<br />
<br />
just another option to look at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauna</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol im lovin the feral spec tho, i liek being &quot;in the thick of things&quot; so to speak. Tired of playing a finger wiggler. <br />
<br />
but thanx anyway, btw one thing i forgot to ask what about pvp say around 70-ish, what build do you guys recommend? i see ALOT of feral speced now, with mangle and everything, i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aww Trixtaa remembered I'm on Malfurion /blush.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rauna,<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm on Malfurion, feel free to drop me a tell sometime and we can talk all druidic like and stuff.  I'm usually on Kyane or my mage ( see sig ).<br />
<br />
General suggestions....Go to a low level area and learn the basic skills, how they are best used, and in what situations. As Anubrims sig best describes &quot;Dont be a cat. Dont be a bear. Dont be a caster. BE A DRUID! &quot;, that really needs to be the fundamental thought behind a well played druid. You're never &quot;locked&quot; into one form or another ( with the exception when you're tanking ).  <br />
<br />
You'll find that you will want to jump between forms depending on how a fight evolves.  Sometimes you can &quot;root and nuke&quot; or &quot;root and scoot&quot; to get out of danger.  <br />
<br />
Feral is a great pvp spec, especially now with all the big stam gear and feral gear out there.  In cat you'll put out some pretty impressive burst and sustained damage.  Bear was pvp-viable until the recent change to bear damage.  While it was disheartening to see, I expected it.  We did a LOT of damage in bear, more than we probably &quot;should&quot; have in a tanking form ( though I do expect to see a bit of a buff come back over the next few patches, as I think the nerf was a tad extreme ).<br />
<br />
Anyways, drop me a tell some time and we can chat.</div></div><hr />
