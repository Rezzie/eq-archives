It was so buggy after a week or so we just quit and bought GuildWars. We beat all the missions in that within a month and got bored of the PvP and stuff and all got WoW.<br />
<br />
We were all Human on the private server but this time we rolled Horde on Blackrock and leveled up to level 6-8 in our respective zones and got in a guild that I am still with today</div></div><hr />

I ran around a lot, confused and got ganked by an alliance outside of . . . oh, tauren starting village (newbness was at 100%)<br />
<br />
and yes, I did click on the alliance because I was that much of a newb. :)<br />
<br />
Still am a newb in fact, just a newb who's read a lot ;)</div></div><hr />

I liked druids so much I rolled my own when I got the game and it went well, I never had any lag problems until I hit IF :(, then I got a new computer :)</div></div><hr />
