This Give Life 30 regen / tick and 4 counter removal.<br />

One of the main AEs we discussed was Mark of Death (Arch-Magus) and Similar effects.<br />
<br />
For those who have recently done Arch Magus using Your Curing Aura, did you notice a differance in the ability to keep your group alive?  I am just curious as to the reaction to this as I no longer currently raid that content.<br />

Our Guild doesn't rely on Druids curing their groups in this event.  What we do is, as each Mark lands, the Clerics break chain, and while curing the raid, the druids take over healing the MT and Off Tanks.  We haven't had a death in quite awhile using this system.  <br />

I put 1 cleric or shaman per group for curing.  If we don't have a total of 9 cleric+shaman then I stack 1 or 2 groups with 2-3 druids each, because it takes that many more druids just to keep a group cured if Gaze + MoD both hit very close together.</div></div><hr />

Saves you 1 shield click per Gaze of Anguish cure. For mark, you can click x3 instead of x4, and cure the entire group in 18-20 seconds if your RC is down.</div></div><hr />

I was prepared to die, but it completely cured everyone in my group the entire fight.  Noone in my group ever had to cure themselves at all.</div></div><hr />
