'smaragd' = 'emerald' in many languages<br />

I'm guessing 'smaragdmoos' is German word for emerald moss, and thus just the translation for the Kael server.</div></div><hr />

One is an invisible mob by the name of  Al`Corisalm.<br />
<br />
Archpriest Del`Maque (lblue to 70) along with his two bone servants, one is light blue to 70, the other is green. <br />

Great Bear is indifferent to me and the others in room are non kos as well. I'm not really sure what to say to this great bear. Also, since I haven't spent much time in this zone other than to do the trials, I have no clue if he is actually a new mob :) Ill try saying stuff to him...</div></div><hr />

When I hailed him, I got the message &quot;Great Bear growls uncooperatively&quot;.  I then asked him about 10 questions, trying to get him to answer.  I handed him the notes and the head and he returned them.<br />
<br />
One interesting thing.  To all but one of the questions, he did not reply at all.  No text.  To the question &quot;what tribe of the dawn?&quot; I got that same message as when I hailed him, &quot;Great Bear growls uncooperatively&quot;.  I got it every time I asked that question, but not with any other question.<br />
<br />
I also tried &quot;what tribe?&quot; and &quot;what dawn&quot; and nothing happened, but when I tried &quot;what tribe of the dawn?&quot;, he growled again.  Wondering if we can get info from him but we have to do something first so that we can understand what he is saying.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I tried charming the bear, thinking I could help it escape.  Didn't work however I did find out that Great Bear is a druid.  He was casting Careless Lightning, fury of air, immolate and drones of doom on me when charm broke.</div></div><hr />

If you notice, the Great Bear, the Silvered Wolf and the snake (no name given that I can see) are the major players in this story. Perhaps we are looking for clues with them? I'm grasping at straws, i know it :)</div></div><hr />

I was going to do this to any peculiarly named Bears / Snakes / or Foxes in the Karana's but hadn't got around to it yet.  <br />
<br />
That is what the silvered wolf said to the animals in the stories of Arelat.  Perhaps the silvered wolf was karana, or a servant of karana (druid) appearing to the animals.<br />
<br />
After reading the posts above, use wolf-form and say &quot;What solar tribe of the dawn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bears were the animals who represented the solar tribe of the dawn, the wolves were animals who represented the lunar tribe of the (moon?).  So I agree that the Great Bear and Silvered Wolf would be the key players here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'This seed was brought to us by a druid of great skill. It should provide the cure we seek, but we do not know the place or circumstances under which to plant it.<br />
<br />
Looking at these two quotes, I think that we're looking to find/create a seed which will grow into the spore bearing plant that attacks disease.  That seed is given to Corun Finisc who then passes it on to the rangers in their quest.  So maybe we're looking for a way to find, imbue, and or create a Red Dogwood Seed?</div></div><hr />

Has anyone tried killing the great bear? Yah i know we arent supposed to kill animals, but its worth a try.

I disagree.  Great Bear is new in PoJ since expansion.  He's a druid.  He growls at being asked about Tribe of the Dawn.  And he's mentioned specifically in the texts that we got.  Just because Sony's not making it easy, doen't mean he's the &quot;wrong&quot; mob :)</div></div><hr />

The owner came from Rathe and was going to Oggok so someone there or nearby might have seen him passing if you show them the head and other stuff. Cobalt scars, sirens, droga, FM, and LoIO are possible too as someone carried the plants near there. Otherwise a mortician, necromancer, or someone similar might be good with mangled bits of bodies. <br />
<br />
To talk to the great bear you might need a bear charm similar to the alligator charm, but that would actually be a far more clever use of clues than Sony usually manages.</div></div><hr />

I think one of the other epics had a bug that the minimum required tradeskill skill was only enforced in experiment mode.  If you looked up the recipe in the new tradeskill UI and clicked combine it would bypass the skill check.  Or maybe it was vice versa.<br />

I'm guessing the same happens for our body paint.<br />

First is submited by Weolyen:<br />
Hasty Note<br />
* http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62851 *<br />
 <br />
This is on Lucy as Text:<br />
EP2DRUBohabNote (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/book.html?name=EP2DRUBohabNote)<br />
 <br />
So are we looking for a NPC named Bohab?<br />
 <br />
Second is:<br />
Submited by Weolyen also<br />
(The same guy that posted before me?)<br />
 <br />
If so spill some real info please like where you got this note, if Bohab is an npc, and where to find the:<br />
Living Brambles Seed <br />
 * http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62850 *<br />
<br />
Anyways if you are the person that submited the item(s) please give better hints then trivs on body paint that has been solved and can be reread back 20 pages.<br />
<br />
If anyone can submit items and not actully have the item, I apoligize for pointing fingers.<br />

 <br />
As much as I wish it otherwise, I don't have the hasty note or the seed, nor do I know how to get them. I was simply the first person running the Item Collector to click on the links Aerious made in the serverwide channel. If I did have them, you would see that I have submitted all the intermediary parts as well, which aren't available in Lucy yet. Aerious made some references to the making the Mangled Head talk, so I guess we make a &quot;Talking Head&quot; or something at some stage. We (at least I) still don't know of anything in Lucy that looks like it might go into the head to achieve this combine.<br />
 <br />
My guess is we find 2 items (possibly mind crystal and soulstone?) and combine them in the head and it comes alive and tells us who it is and what to do next. The problem with the mind crystal and soulstone is they are supposedly for ranger and pally epics respectively (I haven't checked on their class boards). So unless we can get the same items through alternative methods, they don't seem to be for us - Lucy ID's notwithstanding.<br />
 <br />
I'm further guessing that these two items are mini quests in their own right and we need to find the npc's to start them. Presumably linking the mangled head to an npc prompts some dialog (I'm not a believer in handing an empty head to anyone). Alternatively it could be like the goblin hider event where some npc starts us off on a seemingly unrelated quest.<br />
 <br />
I googled Bohab and came up with the &quot;Biological Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms&quot;. I'm guessing someone in the dev team has a passing interest in marine biology or something maybe? Fits in a bit with the diseased maiden hair. Just a bit of interesting trivia I thought.</div></div><hr />

A dead NPC will help us, he is a &quot;soul&quot; of some type, and he is found in a place where we wont die. (ie: not in a tough zone)<br />
<br />
This &quot;soul&quot; does not need a special phrase to get him to talk to us, just hail him.<br />

Also, the combine inside the head must be zone in the right zone or else you will lose one of the 2 items, and you will have to get the item back.<br />

Okay earlier I used a little reverse phsycology on one of the FEFS in serverwide channel who claimed our epic was bugged.

<br />

<br />
Well i modified it to, do unto others as they have done unto you and i got this bit about where supposedly our epic is bugged. First I entered into the channel as &quot;Aezael&quot; and said.<br />
<br />
&quot;guys our epic isn't bugged. I am like 5-6 turn ins past the mangled head&quot; to which Aerious of Quellious replied...&quot;Are you past the coven&quot;? <br />
<br />
Hastfully I looked up the word &quot;coven&quot; on the dictionary.com. And i got this. Coven--noun-- an assembly of witches; usually 13 witches.<br />
<br />
then i replied &quot;I am past the witches&quot; He told me that he spawned them. and that after killing just one of them the depopped. Hence the phrase &quot;our epic is bugged&quot; We need to use this to our advantage.<br />
<br />
Sometime after the head is identified, there will be an event SPAWNED. Known as the coven. A coven is an assembly of witches. Usually 13 witches. Its possibly bugged. but lets move ! solve our epic!</div></div><hr />

Gravelady Beddia herself from PoK was a Bloodsabre which leads me to believe they might be behind solving what's up with the head.  I'd think if anyone is gonna resurrect an unkempt druid's head to speak with you it would be one of them.<br />
<br />
There's a bit of confusion though... with Gravelady Beddia and her books the quest has split up into several things:<br />
<br />
-Mangled Head and what's up with it<br />
-the Great Bear, unkempt forest(wherever that is) and solar tribe of dawn, which probably leads into making the anti-disease seed thing.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the great bear and all that other rubbish comes after because atm we can't get anything out of him... I've personally tried everything from a to z with him and all he does is growls... which leads me to believe we need a character flag or item further along the quest to get him to cooperate(and probably tell us more about making the seed, etc).</div></div><hr />

I went down to the Bertox temple in Queynos Sewers.  The only new mob on track was the tribute master.  All the NPCs there were KoS to me so I didn't try to interact with them regarding the head.  If anyone has any ideas on how to deal with them, you can give it a try.  But I would think there'd be a new mob there if it dealt with our epic.  Or some way to spawn a new mob at least.  <br />

Come to think of it though, I didnt' have the Mangled head container yet when I went to Queynos, so maybe being that far in the quest will spawn a mob in the Bert temple.</div></div><hr />

Tower of Frozen Shadow?  The whole place is Green and maybe on the top floor some LB to a 65....probably would be pretty hard to die there right?<br />
<br />
Just looked it up on allakhazam.com, there is a new mob in ToFS for enchanter epic, so there might be something there for druids.  I'd suggest zoning in, hitting track and checking for any mobs that arent listed on alla, DB, Yellow, and red con mobs should be a clue that they might be new to the zone.  Tserinna is the ONLY mob that might be DB to a 65 before oow came out, been a while since i killed Tserinna, so dont remember if she was LB or DB to a 65.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, collecting a set of books is no 'sacrifice.'  I think she wanted something substantial like an Essence Emerald, but instead saw an opportunity to get the books.  Now, the interesting part, we can get both the emerald and a corpse in Shadowrest pretty easily with one spell.<br />

Only thing I want to point out is an old saying, Kryttos.  It goes something like this:<br />
&quot;Never bullsh** a bullsh**er.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Now, I'm just playing Devil's Advocate here.  It's entirely possible that he saw you speaking of the #coven_spawner in the Serverwide, looked up coven, and concocted an intricate farse.  I will, however, readily admit *someone* on Quellious was beating us to the punch on just about everything.<br />
 <br />
Also, about the definition of coven - recall, if you will, ancient Greek mythology in which there was a coven of three witches (that all shared a single eye).  Three fits right in with the rest of our epic fights and you have to admit a 13-mob encounter, while not out of the question, is a little excessive.  As for them despawning, it could very well be a &quot;guess the coven that has your item or respawn us&quot; event.<br />
 <br />
Regarding the alleged &quot;soul&quot; being somewhere &quot;we won't die&quot; - one person's perceptions are vastly different than another's.  Could be an untrackable mob in Blackburrow...or it could be in Walls of Slaughter.  Neither are &quot;tough&quot; zones, but there's a vast difference in difficulty.<br />
 <br />
Also, for the past week I'd been thinking the reason the Druid Epic wasn't finished was due to a few people holding back information.  The more I look at our quest, the more I realize our quest is seemingly longer than the other epics - I could be wrong, but it seems that way to me.  Not to mention the decided lack of instructions compaired to, for example, the Wizard Epic.  Don't get me wrong - I feel the few selfish Druids trying to get their name in lights are really hurting our progress.  Just wanting people to realize that even if we had a walkthrough tomorrow, we'd still have a heck of a quest to handle.<br />
 <br />
Since I have time to play now, I'll try to spend some time slummin' it up around Norrath.  The question becomes this - if the soul is a seperate entity, why would it seek to help us?  Is it a Druid/Ranger that passed away?  If so, why is it still around?  Maybe I just read into things too much.<br />
 <br />
I googled Bohab and came up with the &quot;Biological Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms&quot;. <br />
As you noted, it is rather odd how it fits in with the Maiden's Hair (it's a monofiliment algae...not to mention the harmful disease it carries).  This may be a clue as to who the note goes to.  Try looking for NPCs that study the oceans in one way or another.  Might pay off...prolly won't, but it might.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone else had this problem? Any ideas?<br />

I also am not sure what you are asking.  You don't make anything to do that combine.  You buy a gutting knife and tackle box, and combine the trigger fish and knife in the tackle box.  That's it.<br />

Without the lead I would have thought the following would have been the best ways to find out how to identify a head:<br />
<br />
1.  Towns.  Check out different cities.  Centers of commerce etc.  Doctors, apothecaries, clinics, morgues.  Probably Paineel, Erudin, and Neriak to see if there were any changes.  Also the Temple of Life in Qeynos.  (Personally checked Erudin and Erudin Palace last night and found nothing).<br />
<br />
2.  Bert.  Grave Lady shows a direct tie to Bertoloxxus.  Plane of Disease, Crypt of Decay, West Karana....all locations where Bert has focused his activity.<br />
<br />
3.  Human Head.  We are sure of one thing.  The mangled head has the same model as a human poacher's head.  I would imagine that can help us focus our search in specific areas.  Qeynos, Freeport, Qeynos Catacombs to start with.<br />
<br />
I think this will be more fruitful than grasping at nebulous hints.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I am going off of a small thought that was posted on eq druids.  The thought was that the mangled head looked like that of a poacher.  He thought we should check the poacher zones, he stated west karana and such but the two he did not put on the list in which there is a large poacher problem and they hate them is JP and SFG.  anyone think this is interesting enough to check out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When someone tells me I should go to a zone I &quot;won't die&quot; in, I would sort of interpret that as you &quot;can't die unless you jump off a tall building 20 times&quot;.  Ok, so I might be way off track, but I would think places to start might be PoTranquility, PoKnowledge, Nexus, Bazaar, Abysmal Sea, other &quot;safe zones&quot; so to speak.  Maybe it could be a newbie zone, but even so I would think that would be limited to &quot;good&quot; zones, such as GFay or BB.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there seems to be an NPC in Natimbi that no one has figured out yet.  Listed on Alla's as Whiahdi, hailing him get's an &quot;Whiahdi does not appear to hear you&quot;.  I have not seen this NPC so do not know whether is undead or not, but is near the Restless Souls camp.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I wish to share my experience on the '3 mobs' that spawned for the epic.<br />
 <br />
The 3 mobs in LOIO.<br />
 <br />
I snared the two which were snarable and kited the last one. Got the drop.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The 3 mobs in EW.<br />
 <br />
Once again I snared/rooted the other two, and focused on the Raider. Another druid I had comunicated with had a rotten streak of luck getting the drop. Im not sure but I think he was killing the other two mobs prior to the Raider. I got my drop 1st time by keeping the other two mobs alive and killing the other 1st. <br />
 <br />
If this is just a stroke of luck it would be the 1st time in EQ I had such a streak. Usually I have to camp ANY drop 2 or even 3 times. <br />
 <br />
It may be a pattern. Keep the other mobs alive and kill the one with the drop before the 'others'.<br />
 <br />
Thanks to all the druids who are working so hard on this! I wish I was clever enough to help push forward, but I just ain't that smart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ulthork Raider spawned in EW approx 5 mins after I zoned in from Kael.<br />
He spawns at approx. 3800, -8350.  He spawns first, then each of his Man O'War buds pops in same location.  I pulled away from spawn point BEFORE the other 2 popped BUT they still come ( walked since not aggro'd ) to the Ulthork Raider's location.<br />
<br />
<br />
Got my totem on 2nd try ( non-consecutive )<br />
I had NOT hailed blumblum in CS before attempting this part.<br />
I DID have my waterproof bag on me.<br />
Brought a ranger with me to haha tank while I blasted.<br />
I ONLY killed Ulthork Raider and left his buds rooted when I ported out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Goblin Contest:<br />
<br />
I targeted a goblin in front of droga and said 'start the contest' at 7 PM...<br />
king and seekers come out for the next 3 hours ( game time ) and FINALLY starts the contest at 10 PM.  I did this with 3 other druids and a RANGER!<br />
<br />
at 7 PM, I ran with ranger down to the giant fort ( more coverage for ranger track ).  right when contest started at 10 PM , goblin pops south east of giant fort, by the Iksar Guardian Statues ( EVERY TIME for us 4 times in a row ).  IF you kill him fast enough, he is the REAL and NO other hiders pop.  If you don't kill fast enough he pops to location 2, in NE area of zone.  we killed each time before going to any other location. we never had more than ONE Hider up.<br />
<br />
Restarting the event.  It ended at 6 PM the NEXT day.  All the seekers would start returning to Droga.  You CAN start the even again at 7 PM , even though there are still Seekers in the zone.  All the Seekers depopped when contest started again. ( just to help speed things up )<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. These are just my experiences I wanted to share to help any others or let them know what to possibly expect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say, 'Hail, Nolan Greenwood'<br />
<br />
Nolan Greenwood gives a gentle nod to Lumia, 'Greetings. I am Nolan Greenwood, warder of the Jaggedpine and retainer of our [ancient ways]. The recent introduction of [outsiders] whose faith and loyalties mimic our own toward The Rainkeeper has led to the rebirth of a long lost excitement and use for my talents, thus my presence here today. Usually, I would not be so easily found for when presented with the choice, for I prefer the sanctuary of the open forest to the confining walls of my room here at Fort Jaggedpine.'<br />
<br />
[What ancient ways?  leads to a Karana-item quest]<br />
<br />
You say, 'What about corruption?'<br />
<br />
Nolan Greenwood says 'The tale of Innoruuk, the vile Prince of Hate, having brought a child into the world and the resulting corruption of our brother forest of Kithicor brought many a tear of mourning and rage to our eyes. And the tales of Bertoxxulous' followers tainting the lands of Karana with their accursed worship and rites boiled the blood in our veins as a thirst for vengeance arose. However, it is not only sorrow and fury that we feel. . . we know regret, for in our absence we were unable to lend our ways to these battles and it is in this knowledge of our absence that we carry the greatest burden. But we cannot let our attentions end with these tales, for a [threat] akin to the previous has seeped through our barricades and the Jaggedpine is in danger.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'What threat?'<br />
<br />
Nolan Greenwood says 'I speak of the gnolls of Blackburrow and the [feral wildlings] to our east in the Unkempt Wood. Very recently, the gnolls unearthed an ancient shrine dedicated to the Duke of Bellow, Brell Serilis. This would normally not be of concern to us, but this shrine lies beneath our forest and their excavation of the site has formed a passageway that connects the outside world to the Jaggedpine. This would not be of consequence if the gnolls were not as hostile as they have proven themselves to be over these past weeks since their arrival. The years of separation from the rest of Norrath have also depleted our [resources], leaving us in great danger to threats such as the gnolls.''<br />
<br />
[What resources? leads to talk about gnolls and Qeynos]<br />
<br />
You say, 'What feral wildlings?'<br />
<br />
Nolan Greenwood says 'I speak of the Unkempt Warders -- human, half elf, and Fier'Dal rangers and druids who pledge their existence entirely to the wild in the name of Tunare, their matron goddess. Although their intentions are not necessarily evil and are very parallel to the rest of those whom fight to preserve nature, they are [more militant and fierce] in their beliefs than any other organization dedicated to the preservation of the natural ways on the whole of Norrath.''<br />
<br />
You say, 'What unkempt warders?'<br />
<br />
Nolan Greenwood says 'I. . . I cannot speak of them in detail. Forgive me in that, but I cannot dishonor the memory of our unfortunate ancestors that were the first to be constructed into these wards. I. . . have said too much already. Again, forgive me, but I cannot speak further of them. Know only that if the day comes that fate would be malicious enough to guide you into the unkempt territory, you will understand my meaning and know these wards within the first, and likely last moments of that chronicle of your life.''<br />

Sorry, back on target..<br />
Has anyone tried Natimbi? The restless souls are there, as well as the named undead that wont aggro until you tell her(?) she is dead. AFAIR, no one had done anything with that and she dorpped nothing if killed. Perhaps Sony modified the rest of the quest as I know she was in earlier.<br />
Also, I like the essence emerald idea. We have already had to ressurect someone ie VSR for epic 1.0, why not someone else? Perhaps the emerald, a copy of the res scroll, used in the corpse zone (whose name I forget)...<br />
And yes, our epic is a bit longer than others, BUT most of the others can NOT be done solo. The chanter epic parts are just a bit shy of raid force to get, so all in all, I will put more time into it, than have to drag my guild into more epic fights. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stumpydru</div><div class="date">09-27-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Here's my input so far to help clear up some postings:<br />
<br />
EW Raider didn't drop the item when we killed just him, leaving the Man-O-War's rooted/snare elsewhere. The Raider spawns first and the MOW's spawn shortly after him, they do not spawn at the same loc, they spawn a about 20 feet away then walk up to him and the wandering begins.<br />
<br />
FM Gobbies - If you see them on track (Generally by Fort, OT/LOIO/FM/BW zonelines, up in the mountains at the staues) you can engage them and 1 out of the bunch is the real Hider which will gate at 10%, so start nuking at 15%. If they are not up then follow the Diguise piece. Torvonolous had the gobbies up for a long period of time so multiple Hiders was killed that night.<br />
<br />
Feerott Task - All you need is 1 druid with the charm to trigger the Terror, I have triggered the Terror 3 times so far and he has dropped the items all 3 times. <br />
<br />
Cauzic Thule - The peirna's spawn if two different locations, the 1st place is in right below the zone in area (Invis go into the CY take a right and up the ladder then go down the hallways to the well, then swim down). The 2nd place is across the CY and up the ladder in the well on the right side. The 2nd spot is a big location so you have room to work in vs. the 1st which is more like a hallway.<br />
<br />
This means you can skip a few steps if folks are willing to you.<br />
<br />
Mypth Busters - Foargaing can be done anywhere in a zone, all forage items are on a loot table and assigned a number that represents how easy it is to get the items plus a random number, just like a loot table on killing a mob. I've been able to zone in to the zones forage and get the items on first tries and then go to other zones and get nothing for hrs. The Forage skill level has nothing to do with it or than can you successfully forage something if so you get an item. There are a few new OOW AA's dealing with foraging, so if you want the chace to forage multiple items at once spend a few AA's.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this clears up some of the questionable posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea that the zone, where the supposed &quot;undead mob&quot; that marks the next part of identifying the mangled head, is a safe one was actually made in a different context than what is being interpreted.  <br />
<br />
I had the idea of checking GM Necromancers in various towns to see if any would be able to help.  I went to the Freeport Necromancer, but one of them simply didnt' respond, while the other one attacked me on sight.  I suggested then that perhaps we should go to Cabilis, Neriak, or some other area where GM Necro's would be located (I had already checked the GM Necro in PoK as well, and couldn't get any info from him either).  When I said that, people expressed concerns of a druid going into places like Neriak.  At which point I said don't worry I'll just go myself (i'm a bit of a nutter in regard to safety ... long live Exodus !)  <br />
<br />
Anyway, after my comment about checking places like Neriak or Cabilis for someone who could identify the head, one of the individuals who claims to have been 2 steps from the end of the quest, said that the mob was NOT in Neriak, or some such place.  It was in a place that was relatively safe... <br />
<br />
Now that doesn't necessarily mean PoK.  Gulf of Gunthak is relatively safe compared to a druid in Neriak.  So although the mob we seek certainly could be in PoK, or the bazaar, or Shadowhaven etc. etc. It doesn't necessarily have to be in order to coincide with this clue... if the clue is, actually, an honest one.</div></div><hr />

Haha.  That's quite funny actually.  Scarecrows have grass in their pants!  Just like Bouncer Flerb observed.  Maybe he's mad that druid's have neglected his broken head for so long, he's gone postal scarecrow-style and turned corrupt, diseasing grass/hay in his destructive wake...<br />

If you saw this in Kod'Taz, then its an event that has been in place since the release of Gates of Discord.  Also, several events in GoD spawn piles of bones once the boss is defeated.  The ikkinz trials are examples of this.  <br />
<br />
However it might be possible that Sony borrowed the GoD idea into one of the new epics.  If there is a pile of bones in an old world or OoW zone, perhaps that is the case.  But any GoD zone having a pile of bones would likely be a GoD event.  You can verify this on Allakhazam though I believe.  A pile of bones should be on the bestiary list in Alla for Kod'Taz.</div></div><hr />

I havent had any luck with him yet either....   However, he is soloable, even if you aren't uber 10k hitpoint equipped.  If not well equipped, make sure to get fully buffed before hand with kazad, focus, c5, etc cause you will need those hitpoints.   Personally, I was only self buffed plus along with C5, and I am not that uberly equipped compared to druids nowdays, although I do have alot better gear than non-raiders.   I mostly have elemental + time loot (no quarm), very little GoD since I quit last spring and almost no hp/mana augments.   The key is to stay out of melee as much as possible while nuking/dotting, but not running far away enough that you are constantly being summoned (ie, you will be hit but dont keep standing there tanking).   Originally, I tried rooting but he summons too much so all spells are interrupted.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Having over 2k less hitpoints than top-end druids doesn't exactly make my gear uber status ;p.   Additionally, I noted that having hp augments will really help (I dont really have much), and if you arent in a raid guild then full buffs from other classes will likely be a requirement ;p.    Some other help can come from the new OOW gear dropping off 1 group named - some of the attuneable and no-drop stuff can be pretty nice from WoS, City, PG, etc.</div></div><hr />

I killed him 5 times before he dropped the totem.   Finally what worked was pulling him with a non snare non damage spell, such as Annul Magic, and ran him all the way to the GD zone.  his cronies followed at a walk pace, and eventually dropped off track range.  I then snared, and rooted him there, and waited 5 mins for my reinforcements to arrive.  no cronies showed up, so they either despawned, or stopped following.  finally we killed him (btw never cast on or touched his cronies this time, that is the only difference from other times.

My technique for soloing the UR was slam kiting with a DC walrus (hasted, with two weapons).  I fully dotted the UR at the start before being summoned, and running minimized the amount of melee damage I took.  I occasionally ran off only a short bit (as described above) to heal myself or refresh a fast casting dot, like Sylvan Embers.  I hit SotW 3 halfway through, and WoW as well.  The only outside buff I has was KEI.<br />
<br />
Took 6 kills to get my drop.<br />
<br />
BTW, just kill off the two blue ulthorks.  They're easily snared and killed, give decent XP, and you don't have to run the UR off to hell and back to get away from them.  The two adds are the easiest part of the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

You don't know until you try.   In my case, I have one time item (the cold DD shield) and one EP piece of armor (bracer).  Everything else is ornate or quested (such as the VP quest items) or soloed in KT.  In fact, I'm still wearing some stuff from Ssra and Kael.<br />
<br />
It can be soloed.  And it can be soloed by a druid in less than the top level uber gear.   That's not to say that every druid can solo it.  *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

Perhaps he bound his own soul to a particular stone?  <br />
<br />
My guess is that Gaedin was the one spreading the disease and he is now dead (eaten by the terror in Feerrott).  How else would the Soulbinder in Freeport have guessed the identity of Gaedin simply by seeing the head?  It seems logical that he could only do so if it is Gaedin's head that we are walking around with.  <br />
<br />
Unless the soulbinder recognized Gaedin's handiwork from the head instead.  But that would seem likely from showing him a stone with a soul bound to it, rather than the head of the 'victim'.</div></div><hr />

Also the soulstone idea we are persuing sounds like a good one.

Athele states that they were found on the shore, and might have belonged to someone involved with the disease.<br />
  <br />
  Unfortunately, I haven't seen Geadin in EK.<br />
  <br />
  Rangers and Druids are definitely fighting the same battle here, on different fronts...<br />
  <br />
  (referenced thread: http://forums.interealms.com/ranger/showthread.php?t=40629)<br />
  <br />
  ~ Fiz<br />
 <br />
 Also:  The NPC who takes the crystals says that they are very similar to the Mind Crystal she fashioned.  When rangers turn in the Mind Crystal to Corun in SFG for the next step in their epic, he gives them a seed, and pockets the mind crystal, saying, &quot;This crystal seems strange, but if you and this Shana believe that it will help, then I know just the person to put it to work.&quot;  Is that person a druid?  Is the seed -- which Corun claims was  brought to him by &quot;a druid of great power&quot; -- the Seed of Wrath?  Is this some crazy druid/ranger crossover mumbojumbo?<br />
 <br />
 My theory: it looks like Geadin is using his soul control powers -- via the gems -- to compel people into distributing the disease.  I suspect at some point it looks like the druids are going to need to get the Mind Crystal from Corun and...give it to Geadin?  Use it on him?  No idea.  Keep looking for him!</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing we're doing this fight soon... seeing as how we're supposed to go after Geadin now, maybe this covenant is related to him... perhaps killing them in pursuit of him since they're his colleagues or something, or maybe they have the soul gems we need for the mangled head?</div></div><hr />

I can't log on for a bit, still working unfortunately.  However, if anyone can, check to see if there are any groundspawns along the shore in EK by Althele, where he partner found the 2 ranger crystals.  <br />
<br />
Alternatively, perhaps the being spreading the disease may have dropped crystals in Cobalt Scar when he spread the disease there, or in Siren's grotto.  Along the same lines, perhaps along the river bank in Feerrott, or perhaps around the lake in LoIO, or in the Rathe Mountains (any water here) or in Frontier Mountains (any water there?).</div></div><hr />

Refering that the 'one' --&gt; Gaedin  had the power to identify the head, but they don't speak of him anymore, and was trying to get you to go away he told you to seek out someone who knew Gaedin better than he, and more apt to talk to you.  <br />
<br />
I speculate that Gaedin needs to be located and spawned, and we find out what to put in the head to combine it, or a book by Gaedin on what to do to combine it.</div></div><hr />

What have we got? Just a new possible trigger phase - or if we're lucky a hidden flag that will now spawn some event.<br />

I bet Geadin doesn't even go by his old name any more.  I did a quick search through alla and didn't find any Geadin mobs.  I didn't find any promising prospects by searching for 'Insane' or 'Mad' either.  So either a new NPC somewhere or going by another name now... or both.<br />

<br />
Here are some things that jumped out at me about this.  <br />
<br />
Nobody seems to give much thought to Caskin mentioning that he went mad because of something the soulbinders did to Geadin.  Perhaps we need to head back the head soulbinder and ask him what he did to the guy.. This might help us find him.  Also of interest.. found this guy on track tonight in Nobles' Causeway:<br />
<br />
Drarakon the Mad (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16263) <br />
<br />
He sees invis and is KOS so the only way to tell if he's for us is to kill him I fear.  Now he's a dragorn but who's to say he's not in disguise?  Absolutely no way to tell if this is our missing Gaedin but I thought it was worth investigating.  It's too late for me to gather a force to kill him and he's obviously not solo material .  If anybody can find info on him being killed and possible drops that would help too.. haven't see any indications of anybody killing him yet.  Let's keep plugging away at this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macnbaish</div><div class="date">09-28-2004, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm after looking at the summary page something occured to me... the people giving vague hints said that an NPC will help us ID the head.. in a zone that we won't die in.  I would bet that this NPC is Gaedin in whatever form he's in now.  He's gonna help us reanimate the head.  If this is the case my post above re: Nobles' Causeway off the mark but this just seems to click.  Keep an eye out in lower level zones for strange NPCs.</div></div><hr />

'I can tell that you are not one of them, so what do you want?  I can no longer be of use to anyone with all the noise in my mind.  I can rarely remember who I am, curse them.' Again he breaks out in insane laughter. '[Curse] me is more like it!'<br />
<br />
You say, 'What Curse?'<br />
<br />
a madman says 'They cursed my mind, ruined the only thing that I had, the thing that made them what they are.' For once his face appears clear of the madness and is overwhelmed with anger. 'I can not do my work in this condition!  I can't!'  He looks at you, his mad eyes looking deep into you, as if they could see your soul. 'You want something of me, something that only I cab give you.  Well, I can't!  They took it from me, my mind.  If you want anything from me, you must [free] me or there is nothing I can do.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'How do I free you?'<br />
<br />
a madman struggles again to retain his control. 'I can force my tormentors from my mind, but only one at a time.  I can never be free unless you destroy them.  If you do that for me, I will do all that I can to help you. With your power it should be easy for you to defeat them singly.  Will you do this for me?<br />
<br />
You say, 'I will do this.'<br />
<br />
a madman says 'Thank you.  It will take a moment for me to force each of them out.  You must destroy them quickly or they will invade my mind again.'<br />
<br />
a madman tightens all the muscles in his body as he exerts his will over his tormentors.<br />
<br />
a haunt says 'Please, allow us to continue our work.  Do not allow this man to return to his ways.'<br />
<br />
You have slain a haunt!<br />
<br />
a spirit says 'We understand your need, but you must not free him.'<br />
<br />
You have slain a spirit!<br />
<br />
a guardian tormentor says 'He is a dangerous creature.  Please do not prevent us from doing our work.'<br />
<br />
You have slain a guardian tormentor!<br />
<br />
a lamented knight says 'Destroy me if you must, I can not hold him alone.  We do not blame you for what you do, for you have great need and you seek to save others.  Do not allow this to weigh heavily upon you.'<br />
<br />
You have slain a lamented knight!<br />
<br />
a madman laughs outrageously for a long moment, then looks somewhat embarrassed at his own outburst. 'Thank you for your help, .  I shall never forget what you have done for me.  Now, you have a skull that you need to converse with.  This I know because your soul is open to me.  I can conjure something that will help you with this, if you [still desire it].<br />
<br />
You say, 'I still desire it.'<br />
<br />
a madman says 'Very well.  Here it is. Only use it in the area where the owner of that head was killed.  Now, I have much time to make up for.' He laughs with much of the same dementia that was evident before.'<br />

All the spirits / ghosts were dark blue to a level 68, none of them summoned, all were easy to root and snare... had a good amount of hp, mostly since you need to kill four in a row... bring a nuker friend, or a lot of patience. Otherwise completely solo-able.</div></div><hr />

So, I had to sit around for about 90 minutes waiting for another indifferent madman to spawn. I'm guessing this is like our other mobs and that's the general respawn time... 90 +/-.<br />
<br />
The &quot;spirits&quot; don't hit that hard, but they do heal themselves. So, having another nuker to help nuke em down is a bonus. I didn't get the kill shot on all of them, but still got my soul stone.... I guess just make sure you are grouped together for it :)<br />

These three npc's are a far leap of faith and probably the result of just pure all out 'hail everything and hope'.  I am not sure if the other epics include equally obscure npc's that are not hinted towards, but the druid epic seems to include quite a few, which is making it significantly difficult to decifer up to the 1.5 stage.</div></div><hr />

Also, could the fact that one of the creatures that we have to expulse from Gaedin is a tormented knight be a lead? Paladin guild or something? &lt;ponders some more&gt; And now that we have freed Gaedin, does he go somewhere else to extract revenge on the soulbinders? If he does that, is there a congregation of soul binders anywhere? Just speculating and conjecturing.<br />

 I'd wager that the spirits haunting Gaedin's mind were the souls that he had sucked out of people and into crystals.  I bet the soulbinder's curse was simply to put those suckers in his mind :P<br />

<br />
This to me  indicates that now, we have to find the soul belonging to the head. We need to get that soul and bind it in the SoulStone we got, so we can converse with it, prolly in the form of a talking head :) It's in the realm of the dead I'd assume, so I guess we need to find a way to bring it back to the place it died. Sounds to me like necromancy, or fortune-telling-like.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing we need to speak to a necromancer for more info, maybe Gravelady bellia? Hand in that soul stone, perhaps? Or perhaps a Soulbinder, but we kinda already got that part. <br />
<br />
Another possibility is to go look for the gypsies, perhaps something can be done with them.<br />

Gravelady Bellia is actually a Shadowknight (Gravelady, as opposed to a Gravelord -male).  There is however, an iksar GM Necro that roams nearby her.  He made some interesting comments when I hailed him, but they may simply be generic comments from PoP release.</div></div><hr />

First time poster here. It appears to me that there may be 2 gems needed for the head as the text refers to a &quot;series of gems.&quot; The only thing that is making be question my own theory is the fact that when the soulstone was identified there was nothing to indicate that it was &quot;one of...&quot; or &quot;part of...&quot;<br />
 <br />
Another thing that has occurred to me is that perhaps a different soulbinder may be able to provide more info, maybe one that was more sympathetic to his cause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a NPC in Katta Castellum in the graveyard, a male Guard Lennon, kneeling at a gravestone, crying over someone named &quot;Reeza&quot; his beloved (sounds like a dead female).  Worth checking out, to see if he has any additional info.</div></div><hr />

Contrary to what some people thought in chat, he has NO placeholder. While I was camping him, I didn't kill any mobs, and he still spawned after 2 hours. Im not 100% sure on the 120 minute timer. However when I logged in a guildmate said that she had killed the ghosts around 9:30 EST. The madman respawned for me at 11:32 EST. So if anyone else can confirm the 2 hour timer?<br />
