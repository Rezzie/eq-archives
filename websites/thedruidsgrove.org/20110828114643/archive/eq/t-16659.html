them 2 single target heals are more then fast enuff to never have t use the same spell line.<br />

i have out healed clrs in every zone out ther for single group stuff with this set up i am asked for more then clrs becous they know i will keep a group up better then a clr. and 90% of the tiem we only have a rager for slows when its just me but when its a clr in group and we wipe we all so have a bst.and ya no need for heals in a  zone from me if i can do it alone the clr should so.<br />
 <br />
useing 2 of the same spell line is a waist all so the swell will over ride the surg when it hit any ways so save mana if ya want fast heals load some other form of a blast heal.</div></div><hr />

I dont know about you but I'm not alwayas grouped with high end raid geared tanks or Group members.  They sometimes cant take the hits well and their hp drops pretty rapidly.  Survival of the fittest is a great tool but a lot can happen in that 90 seconds that its down.  All it really takes is you using swell to catch back up on the tank and then needing a fast heal to save the wizzy or Mage (etc etc) that just took aggro but swell is still down.  Or vice versa.  It adds a lot to our &quot;emergency&quot; heal capability.  Which IMO, You can't have too much of.  Having both also made it easier to just get a big burst of healing through in short amount of time.  I'd duo with a wizzy friend and sometimes we'd take on summoning nameds.  He'd do all the DPS while i just spam healed to keep him up.  It definitely had its uses, but its something I can easily live without.</div></div><hr />

You're unlikely to be using both on the same person. It was useful if you'd just fired one on the tank and then the chanter takes a smack and needs a quick blast.<br />
<br />
But you'd already know that of course, what with you being able to outheal a cleric.<br />
<br />
PS: You must play with the worst clerics in the history of EQ.</div></div><hr />

I would be happy if we got an additional line of fast heals that could be used alongside the Adrenaline line.</div></div><hr />

So i guess u are too uber to use a helpfull 2nd 1.5 second heal. Maybe I should lol at you since ur too arrogant to know how helpfull a 2nd 1.5 sec spell is. Oh ya and like the other poster said if u can out heal top end clerics then I'd hate to be a tank on ur server.</div></div><hr />

I am less of a healer because of the linking... I figured we would come out in force like the SKS did to get this unlinked .. but we were lazy ... like a druid should be I suppose.</div></div><hr />

*shrugs* perhaps. But of all the spells that got linked only the shadowknights have convinced the developers to unlink one set of spells that should not have been linked to begin with (they were not upgrades) and because they could show that those two spells were vital in their ability to perform their primary role.<br />
Druids complained about the linking and got told that Adrenaline Swell was an upgrade to Adrenaline Surge, and that only one of those spells should be used. (same answer we got for NBW too, and that in fact every other class in the game got. Linking those spells was always intended and it not being the case was a mistake by the developers.)<br />
Much as we all dislike the change, it was fairly obvious that it was not going to change and it became a matter of picking your battles. Banging your head against a concrete wall does not move the wall, but it will make your head hurt.<br />
