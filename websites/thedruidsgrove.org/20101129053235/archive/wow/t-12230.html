I was resto for a very long time (resto raider for MC, BWL, AQ40, Naxx up to the 4 horseman), but when TBC came out, I ditched resto and followed my passion of feral.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm getting frustrated in Arena as feral and have decided to take some advice from friends and run this weekend resto. Problem is, I haven't specced resto in so long, I am not sure I could build an affective talent spec on my first try with PvP in mind. <br />
<br />
For example, in a arena, if a druid shifts to tree, it's basically putting a huge bullseye on himself, right? a &quot;come kick me&quot; invitation. I've even wondered if I should wear my tanking staff from SSC while pvping just to confuse people. <br />
<br />
How far back down feral do I want to go? I am not sure I could pvp without things like improved bash and improved stealth and feral charge.<br />
<br />
In the balance tree, something I haven't touched since they moved OOC to resto, is it worth digging down to nature's reach? Anything else to pick up?</div></div><hr />

You will need to go at least as far as nature's swiftness in the resto tree.  For feral I would recommend going no further than feral charge - that still allows you to pick up improved stealth and brutal impact.<br />
<br />
<br />
When pvp'ing, its often a good idea to try to second guess the enemy.  If you think their first move when they see you will be to try to gank you, put some hots on yourself ahead of time so that they are ticking away during the inevitable stunlock.<br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't recommend using tree form at all, as you can be banished by warlocks while in tree form and the reduced movement speed has a serious impact on your survivability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also don't forget to stock up on +stamina and +resilience gear :&gt;<br />

but it would fit my playstile i think.<br />
Some of you may find subtlety talent unusual, but<br />
it doesent only reduce threat, it also decreases the chance<br />
your hots will be dispelled, wich is great seeing that now<br />
every other class seems to have dispels (hunters and locks come to my mind) :D<br />
