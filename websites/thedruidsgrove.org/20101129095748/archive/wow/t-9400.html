<br />
i am aware of the +22 int and +15 agi enchant, just wondering if there is a +15int enchant?? If there is one, does anyone what the materials needed are??<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">10-04-2005, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a +9 int to 2H enchant, tho it's somewhat rare as it's a dropped enchant.  Looking at the difference between that and 22 int, for the materials it's pretty minimal (some vision dust and like 10 shards).<br />
<br />
I went for the 22 int on my QDCR (gonna be a while for me to have DKP for SoD or Dredger).</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Sonny I remember when +9 int was not only flashy but worth walking up hill both ways in the snow to the enchanter shop to get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
+9 int is plenty for most items, +22 int is overcompensating on anything that you don't expect to keep long term (it is an epic enchant for a very epic item).  I only have +9 on my dredger since I hope to get a good staff from either BWL or Sith.  Dredger doesn't fall into the worthy of +22 enchant from our guild enchanter and no way am I buying all those shards to enchant an item I might keep another 2-3 months max.<br />
<br />
The main thing about enchants is to remember that if an item isn't already more than satifactory for the job then boosting it with enchants won't help it much.  You are much better off looking for an item with the stats you WANT rather than enchanting with stats that an item doesn't have.</div></div><hr />

I'll say it again though, for the difference in mats between +9 and +22, I would never put 9 int on a weapon.  As long as you have 1 crafter who can make things to DE into GEEs, you're golden.<br />
<br />
Some of the other enchants - spell power, healing power - have positively insane material components - and I have no intention of ever spending that amount of gold or doing that amount of farming.  Of course, a Righteous Orb is worth over 100g on my server, so your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
One other thing - the 22 INT can go on a 1H weapon.  For an easy to get 1H, check out:<br />

Venoxis is the Snake Guy - and hands-down the easiest boss in the zone.  He is likely 15-mannable with a well geared group.  It dropped for us last night.  Lucky mage walked away with it.</div></div><hr />

But as it is I will stick to my belif that spending large amounts of cash to enchant inferior weapons (and at this point I consider my Dredger an inferior weapon) with epic enchants is a waste.  Maybe when BWL is on farm mode and I don't have the nightly repair bills the cost of a +22 won't seem as much :) but as I am expecting to upgrade my weapon fairly soon it's pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">10-13-2005, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you - especially on enchants like +healing and +spell power.  The essences are extremely hard to get (less so if you know someone who is willing to xmute for nothing), and Righteous Orbs on my server are going for 75-150g.<br />
<br />
For 22 INT, I got nearly all the mats by farming leather and DEing Wicked Leather Headbands.  I think I actually bought maybe 4-5 shards.  The number of GEEs is the same for both the 22 and 9 int enchants, iirc.<br />
<br />
Lately, I've noticed a much reduced rate of GEEs from the headband, and therefore it may have been nerfed.  Still, 10-20 isn't much of a sample size, and I may have been inordinately lucky in the past, or unlucky recently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This comes from disenchanting green items in the 51-60 level range.  I obtained all mine (have gotten the +22 int enchant twice now) by farming leather, making Wicked Leather Headbands, and mailing them to an alt for disenchanting.  You can also get shards from the headband, but only about 1/15 or 1/20.<br />
<br />
For shards, farm Dire Maul with an enchanter, or simply visit the AH.  Unfortunately the 1.8 content patch (with Slithus quest requiring a shard to spawn Dukes) have about doubled the price of Large Brilliant Shards on my server - from 3-4g each to 6-10g each.</div></div><hr />
