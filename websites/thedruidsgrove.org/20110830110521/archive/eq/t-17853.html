I hear my former server Cazic Thule is gone... guess it got merged with another one.<br />
<br />
I haven't played since just before the LDoN expansion.  Is there an easy way to get caught up on all expansions at once?<br />
<br />
Wondering how are things in-game these days?  Are there decent places to solo at my level?  I only have a handful of AAs I think...<br />
<br />
I know at one point they were talking about doing revamps of some of the lower level zones.  Would I be better off starting a new character?  Or trying to re-learn how to play my old ones?</div></div><hr />

Plus you get the mercenary which will help you solo. Well, druid not so much  Alternate Abilities come by pretty easily in the lower levels now, so, you should grind them early, to get the basics of what you need for the higher end. Alternate Abilities, the game is now built around, you will need around 500-600 just to do your basic functions in the game at the higher end.  The game is basically a DPS festival at this point.</div></div><hr />

I felt it was unnecessary. They had 500-600 aa's or so during the LDON era, just the thing was at around that point, you were starting to consider spending in stats. I think that is why around Luclin, despite the horrible release of that expansion, the new subscriber rate started to slow up, that and other games, but, the eventual overemphasis of one character, and not the fun factor of the game.  <br />
<br />
That is what I really feel Sony did wrong, well that and many other things, but, honestly, who wanted to repeatedly do the Veeshan's Peak Key, before and after, or Sleeper's, Vex Thall, Emp. Ssra, and later the Pop flagging and backflagging and so on, not to mention getting a thousand or so aa's per character.</div></div><hr />
