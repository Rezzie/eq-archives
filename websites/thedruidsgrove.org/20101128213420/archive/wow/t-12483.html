<br />
ie <br />
<br />

hit<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
last night i'm waiting to start a heroic run somewhere with a couple of guildies and i get a /w out of no where about am i tank...yes.....what hp do i have....<br />
<br />
so after answering it goes totally quiet - now the person who /w me had asked in LFG a few mins before my /w for a tank to help finish Arca heroic - they just needed the trash and the last boss.<br />
<br />
when i got no reply i just started wondering what sort of stats i should have for the various heroics....<br />
<br />

<br />
so far all i have done in the past few days is 2 runs to heroic Slave Pens.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First few questions:<br />
- Are you uncrittable?<br />
- What's your armor at?<br />
<br />
Bear tanks excel at taking consistent and predictable damage, with very little spike damage.  You should have somewhere between 20-25k AC at this point, and probably around 10 - 11k HP.<br />
<br />
Lower than 10k HP and you're really risking spike damage issues, especially in heroics.<br />
<br />
Personally I geared myself like this:<br />
Def to uncrittable<br />
stam<br />
agi / dodge<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the bear MT in my guild: http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Malfurion&amp;n=Deeps<br />
A good portion of her gear is from badges ( Neck, belt, cloak, boots, wrists, ring - though she got her neck from Kara and her boots are crafted ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-24-2008, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for your reply Big.<br />
<br />
re - armoury, i'll check to see if i logged out in kitty or bear gear !<br />
<br />
looks like it was kitty gear i logged out in - will log out in bear in a sec although i dont know how long it takes to update.<br />
<br />
In bear gear my stats are :<br />
<br />
Uncrittable<br />
13.1k HP (with gotw)<br />
25466 arm<br />
23.56% crit<br />
28.64% dodge<br />
<br />
I can also get a bit more Sta and less Ar by switching a trinket and using the Commander's Badge from Netherwing.<br />
<br />
Yes i have seen some very nice badge rewards. hence wanting to run them a lot for badges now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">03-24-2008, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those stats look fine for heroics, provided you are with a competent group. The more newbish your PUG is, the more stats you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-24-2008, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats are fine.  The guy that sent you a tell is an rtard.  <br />
<br />
Crit doesn't matter at this point ( though it's always nice for threat gen ) but I wouldn't go out on a limb trying to get it.<br />
<br />
Focus on stam, ac ( till you approach the cap ), and dodge / agi and you'll do just fine.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-25-2008, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed Fall - i am already of the opinion that having some good people with you is vital for heroics as compared to normal mode.<br />
<br />
Last night we started a SP heroic and were breezing it when the server crashed and it reset the instance and we did not have time to start again :(<br />
<br />
Then we tried BM and that was tougher compared to normal mode.<br />
<br />
Big : i've always concetrated on Ar / Sta as the 2 most important stats and added agi/str when possible.<br />
<br />
How important is HIT ? I am lacking in this stat and dont find many items so far that add hit so i've used some gems mainly.<br />
<br />
I'm only running about 50 ish, although i make sure i always have some of the talbuk food that adds +20 hit so am currently running with +70 ish.<br />
<br />
Is this to low ? <br />
<br />
Finally a question / observation on heroics - Is CC much less reliable ?<br />
<br />
So far have found that rogues get seen far more often b4 they can sap and hunters traps either fail to work or last about 2 seconds....<br />
<br />
Mage sheeping seems the only reliable CC.<br />
<br />
Guildie whose run more heroics, although not many says he's found this to be the case everywhere he has gone so far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">03-25-2008, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CC is as reliable as it was before.<br />
<br />
@Kheldar: are u playing arena? The S3-chest-piece is an awesome tanking piece. it has more armor/stam than the clefthoof, +hit, +crit, agi and str( for dogde, crit, AP), resilence for the crit-immunity and armor-ignore.<br />
<br />
Our main-tank used it until the T5-chest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-25-2008, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, well is it down to the talent build then cos traps have been so unreliable every heroic so far.<br />
<br />
nope i cant stand pvp.<br />
<br />
hoping i can aim for some badge reward pieces to improve on the heavy clefthoof set ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">03-25-2008, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2.4 testservers are down. so patch should come tomorrow online.<br />
then u can spend badges for some nice tanking items.<br />
for exampe this one:<br />
Embrace of Everlasting Prowess (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34906)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-25-2008, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those badge items won't be available right away.  The server has to complete some things prior to the badge vendor being available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-26-2008, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so 2.4 has added some new badge items ?<br />
<br />
what does the server have to complete prior to the vendor being available ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Well we completed the Daily Heroic Ramparts last nite. a fair few wipes although we went through about 9/10 people to complete it so consistently of approach was sometimes lacking.....dont you just hate it when suddenly in the middle of a run someone says ' sorry got to go to a guild raid to Kara now'  and another 'got to go out bowling now with friends' - blood and boil springs to mind.<br />
<br />
We lost 2 people at the last Dragon boss after wiping once! By this time the 3 of us guildies wee losing the will to live. Luckily daily heroics are as popular as a sweet shop is to a child so we had 2 replacements in 30 seconds and killed him 3rd attempt.<br />
<br />
Cue 1 primal nether and 5 badges for the nights work for this bear :bubbrubb2 <br />
<br />
Oh and S3 - yes we found cc more like its normal reliability last night - sheep, sap and even trapping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-26-2008, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2.4 badge loot:<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Smith_Hauthaa<br />
<br />
Your server has to complete daily quests in the new area to recapture the area before you'll have access to the new badge vendor.  As of this morning my server was 70-ish% through phase 1 and we were down until mid afternoon due to additional issues most servers didn't have.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Mage sheeping seems the only reliable CC.Another option is off-tanking.  There is no reason why another player (of the right class/spec/gear) couldn't off tank an extra mob.  DPS their mob first.  Then have them join in on the main pack as a DPS.  This is one place where Druid's shine.  Bear for a few seconds, cat for the rest.  Repeat.<br />
<br />
To do so, requires that you have good DPS and that your healer can handle 2 tanks for a short period of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
indeed tlbj - so far we've basically had a party consisting of me to tank, holy priest, mage, lock and hunter.  sometimes a rogue instead of either a hunter or lock.<br />
<br />
with a hunter the pet has done some tanking to capture and hold one mob for as long its hit points last !<br />
<br />
<br />
still learning but we're having fun.  apart from a mage and lock last night who managed to pull mobs and wipe us 4 times in SP !  once pulling a mob rite after a wipe when i was still eating some spicy talbuk !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalbear</div><div class="date">03-27-2008, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I go as DPS I often off-tank mobs. It's a great way to provide CC without actually having a valuable CC. This is really useful against mobs that can't be CCed normally, such as the Myrmidon defenders in SP. <br />
<br />
It can be a strain on a healer depending on the healer, but it can work out really well for the viability of a feral as a DPS slot in an instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-28-2008, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah never had another druid in the grp yet Kalbear.<br />
<br />
hence hunter pet makes the ultimate sacrfice !<br />
<br />
so far our one healer seems ok - not totally sure of his stats etc but he is around +1600 healing. some epics and blues.<br />
<br />
i know he was looking at a new badge loot cloak last nite to purchase - Bishop's Cloak ?  iirc ?</div></div><hr />
