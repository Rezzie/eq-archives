Took me a week, but I finally found one. Or if you are impatient and want a smidgling of xp, just keep killing cyclops till tainted spawn. <br />
<br />
As for soloing, its possible at around level 60. Just remember to apply an attack debuff, keep DS and regen on yourself and nuke nuke nuke!</div></div><hr />

<br />
However the other day I was there, he spawned, and did of course summon. So there goes my so-called knowledge  :shuffle: <br />
<br />
Spawning this guy is all about luck. When I did my 1.0, he was the 4th or 5th thing to spawn once we started killing. When I came back to help a friend, it took us about 3 days, staying there for a few hours each time. Good luck to you and give him an extra DoT from me =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not suprised.  The corrupted has this nasty reputation for being spawned by people and being let loose on the surrounding area.  I've seen 3-4 of him up at once.  What we used to do was to train/snare/root him over to the Ancient Cyclops island and leave them there.  Their pathing would not take them over to the AC spawn, so it was all good, though some AC hunters still didnt appreciate it.  :)</div></div><hr />

I haven't tried solo VSR, but any other mob/encounter I can solo with ease.<br />
Black Reavers are such fun soloing. Tho I have yet to get more than 3 of them to spawn on top of the other.</div></div><hr />
