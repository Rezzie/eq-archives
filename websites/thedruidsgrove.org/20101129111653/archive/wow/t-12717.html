Enchant your chest with 15 spirit.<br />

Enchant your boots.  It's pretty much a toss-up between Vitality and Boar's Speed here.<br />

Get to exalted with SSO and craft the Redeemer'rs Alchemist Stone (replace the Ribbon).</div></div><hr />

The healing alchemist stone is seriously the best healing trinket out there for tree druids (and for any other healer)  by a mile. Only thing that might come close to it is the trinket that drops from Illidan... which might be quite some way to go for most of us. :D</div></div><hr />

I've noticed that it takes a bit more skill to heal than it ever took to dps, so I do spend more time swearing at the screen these days &gt;.&gt;<br />

I can not wait for a Memento of Tyrande.  Of course ... we have to kill Illidan first .........</div></div><hr />
