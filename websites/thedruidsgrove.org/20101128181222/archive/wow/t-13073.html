<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">12-03-2008, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm full feral and have been since rolling my first toon 9 months after release, and I have a life outside of WoW. Generally, I think Blizz has done some good things with druids through the two X-pacs (yes, I remember when you had to spec Innervate if you wanted to raid), but there are just too many stats for me to keep track of these days as a feral druid and I'm too busy (lazy) to research them all, do the math and compare them. So I figured some brilliant feral druid here could help me out. Please rank the following in order of importance for DPS:<br />
<br />
Agi<br />
Str<br />
Hit<br />
Crit<br />
Expertise<br />
Haste<br />
Armor penetration<br />
<br />
And for tanking:<br />
<br />
Sta/HP<br />
Armor<br />
Defense<br />
Agi<br />
Dodge<br />
Relative need for DPS stats above to generate sufficient threat<br />
<br />
Of course, I know these are all relative, but I need some general guidance here. I don't even know what the hit cap is anymore, for cryin' out loud. Defense cap still 415 or has that changed with SotF?<br />
<br />
I feel like such a baby asking to be spoonfed all this good strategy, but it's gotten really confusing to me with all this new gear dropping with all these funky new stats, and the old paradigm of agi&gt;str once hit capped just doesn't seem to apply any more. Thanks in advance for any help.<br />
<br />
P.S. This is a great opportunity for some brilliant feral druid to write a &quot;How to feral druid in WotLK&quot; guide (hint, hint, nod, wink).</div></div><hr />

You no longer need to get +def (or +res) at all if you have 3/3 SotF.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a good write-up on DPS stuff yet.  There are bits-n-pieces in several blogs, but nothing I'd link to at this time.</div></div><hr />
