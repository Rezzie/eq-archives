<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-22-2005, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I am looking to try out a PvP server. I've never been too much into PvP in other games, but I feel like I am missing a whole dimension of WoW without it. Human opponents instead of AI makes strategy more important.<br />
<br />
So, I'm looking to start a druid on a PvP server. Not 100% PvP based, still mostly PvE until the bug bites me, but the element of danger is, intriguing. He will absolutely still be Alliance, so I know I will probably have the number advantage, but what else. Any tips, any major differences between a red and a blue server; ie more STA focus etc? Any suggestions which realm to pick to choose? I really like my druid on Zul-jin, but I am not really attached to the community as so far its been all solo. I'm only 16 so rolling another toon, isn't going to set me back a whole lot and isn't worth paying the money to move him.<br />
<br />
edit* On another note, while here at work I can't access the Blizzard page, so I can't read what all the choices are and what the true differences are. If anyone is bored, a quick explanation of what the official and unofficial differences are would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
TIA,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">09-22-2005, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP servers take the PvE aspect of the game to next level by adding a 2nd element of danger.  Not just Mobs can potentially kill you in the contested zones, but now you must fearful of the Horde movements in the area as well, and vice versa.  Also it is quite common especially around Instance entrances (outside of Battlegrounds) to get caught up in sweet group PvP.  My groups have come across horde groups so many times when preparing to do an Instance and even Raids (UBRS, Scholo, ect...)  <br />
<br />
Also, don't forget where there is open PvP in these zones, the griefers will roam as well.  Some people get their enjoyment from the game by putting in the effort to camp people, allot of the times, into really long timers (had a guildie camped to like 4 minute timer before his next res or something to that affect.).  It can become frustrating too when your quest givers are killed by a 60 Rogue who is bored.  Places like Aastrannar and Splintertree Outpost are constantly harassed by level 55+ Characters of their respective factions.  <br />
<br />
Words of wisdom, if you are ganked, do not post on the forums about said event.  Not only will you get no sympathy (it is a PvP server after all), but some people will make it a point to gank you even more.  Just bear through the hardships of a PvP server at the lower levels, and give them hell when you can at the end-gaming levels.  Reaching 60 gives you a feeling of great accomplishment on a PvP server because no only did you overcome the odds and fought your way through the Environment, but now people are wearier of striking at you wherever you roam without help.  Although some people still like to try.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-22-2005, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent, thank you. As for getting ganked, I'm not really worried about it. Its part of the game. It happens, and as stupid as it sounds putting it this way, &quot;until you can do something about it, you can't do anything about it.&quot; So contested zones, I am guessing that means no man's land? So does that mean that I can't be PvPed in my area, but can be when I am not in my area?<br />
<br />
Any suggestion what realm to join? Are some harsher than other's. Do some of the realm's have a more mature attitude than others? The only thing I can't stand is griefer's. I understand the us vs them philosophy, but corpse camping is just stupid. Another is messing up someone's big fight. I mean its cool to run by and heal a mob someone is fighting, but if that is the end of an extreemly tough quest it would probably bug me a bit.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">09-22-2005, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you had better expect to be be camped and have enemies make you die to mobs instead of them so you receive armor damage, it simply comes with the territory.  <br />
<br />
contested zones are the zones you progress into around your high teens.  in these zones, you can be killed by an enemy player at any time.  by contrast, in a friendly zone, you cannot be attacked by an enemy, not even a 60, first.  you have to attack them for them to be able to attack you because you are not &quot;flagged&quot; for combat.  if you have recently entered a friendly zone after being in a contested one, you will be flagged for combat, but you'll pick up these subtleties as you go along.<br />
<br />
basically, you need to understand that if you are seen by an enemy player, they will attempt to kill you if they have an opportunity for no other reason than because they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-22-2005, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would imagine that Shadowmeld becomes even more useful in PvP. I know its not as good as Rogue Stealth, but how well does it stack up against other players? From what I know, stealth is based on level difference, stealth rank, and in the 180 degree range in front. Taking out the stealth rank since there isn't one, and assuming both players are 60. How often would you be seen if you were just standing there? How does that compare to a MOB seeing you?<br />
<br />
I think I am going to roll one tonight. I probably won't notice much difference until I move into those contested territories, so it won't make an immediate impact, except the loss of my bear form.  Still don't know which realm. I'll probably pick one on a whim because of the sound of the name since there doesn't seem to be much difference between them.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help everyone, and as always if you have more imput I am always willing to soak it up.<br />

They will wait for you to finishi fighting your mob, or to finish eating/drinking before striking (hiss @ the Undead Mage who killed me while I was fighting a Devilsaur).  When it comes to largescale raids and outdoor raid bosses, usually the sides (atleast on my server) don't intentionally sabotage another's raid attempt at the Boss.  <br />
<br />
As for realms, I dunno.  Bonechewer is decent, though there is a noticable level of skill among the horde than there is alliance.  Overall Alliance isn't too bad, we do have more interal drama though betweem guilds than the Horde does.  Which makes Alliance PuGs for Battlegrounds gimped compared to the horde PuGs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-23-2005, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rolled on Bonechewer last night, but there was some patch to take care of &quot;potentially exploitable geometry&quot; when I got home. Ever since then, after I log in my video card stops working. I'm going to try updating drivers tonight, but I usually keep them pretty current. Then again, I thought I was turning of the AC, and actually turned on the heater yesterday before I left, so it was HOT in there. I hope I didn't end up overheating and causing permanent damage. It only happens when I log-in though. If I don't log in nothing bad happens. I'll try disabling some add-ins first.<br />

OK /ramble off.<br />
