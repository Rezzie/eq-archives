Anyhow, anyone able to pass on what NOT to attempt to solo in the new expansion?</div></div><hr />

The wolves were light blue I think but the brownies were 75-78 level mobs.  Not the most fun when 1200 hitters are chasing you.<br />
 <br />
Be careful if you try and kite in the open area in Fortress Mechanotus to avoid the packs of wandering gnomes that can sneak up on you.  Also, they wandered in sets of 5 and even with the new harmony, I was unable to split them single (too close...turned and pathed over each other.. type of issues).<br />
 <br />
Would probably be a very good spot for a kite group though.</div></div><hr />

There are tons of animals for charm kiting as well.</div></div><hr />

The seem to have low resists and burn well, till you find a summoner. ;) They hit like the proverbial truck. My party crasher was a &quot;sneak&quot; something or other.<br />

The gators on the SE shore of Loping Plains were easily solo'd.  The bears and frogs nearby will NOT assist the gators, although the gators themselves will assist.  Gators, frogs, and bears (oh, my!) are all amiable to a druid with no faction hits.  And lovely scenery. :)</div></div><hr />
