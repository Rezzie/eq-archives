It allows you to take a raid into the instance to slumber this korlach.  <br />
<br />
Tried it last night.  The NPC gives you a clicky item to use in the task, casts Jaz's rune.  As we engaged him, I clicked it a couple times, getting an add each time as a result.  We got him down to 81% and his hp would drop no further.  He also switched between two emotes; healing mode vs. mental defenses mode.    Clickin the quest item didn't have any different effects in either mode.  <br />
<br />
The only information I've been able to gather from boards i've read was:  <br />
1. that 'gotta know when to take attack off' .. as per the modes/emotes i would only guess..  <br />
and <br />
2.  that 'it's got 50 adds'... <br />
<br />
can anyone toss out a time-saver of a tip?  all i can guess is to try those rumors out.l</div></div><hr />

Deal with adds accordingly. After he's belowe 20 or 10%, start clicking your stone. You do NOT have to kill him, simply &quot;sleep&quot; him with your stone that only works with him on low health.<br />
<br />
FYI, if you're doing this for the resist clicky... you don't need to do this. This is sort of a raid, and so it does not apply to the Old Fortune Teller's task.</div></div><hr />

It took us only a couple mins to drop his hp down to 81%.  Then for the next 15 mins we tried anything we could do get it any further.  Thats the part that we were stuck.</div></div><hr />

This event is a raid, my guild has done it with 1 group multiple times.. but we're Coa/Vishi/Demiplane geared. You can invite more people in if you're having problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">11-09-2005, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Believe the way the script works is at 80 60 40 and 20% he switches off his mental defenses or the other emote and you click the rune on him x times, spawning an add ea. time (at this pt you want all melee off of him -put them on the adds- and until you figure out what x is probably have the tank off attack as well), until he gets knocked out.<br />
 <br />
He'll stop attacking for a while (at this pt consider him mezzed, if someone hits him he'll wake up early and the script won't advance) then give an emote about waking up... tank re-engages as he comes live and you repeat the above for the next increment of 20% iirc.<br />
 <br />
At 20% or a bit under he stays asleep / depops when you mez him again and a chest pops.<br />
 <br />
Kinda a bunk raid to do though, it's not needed for the clicky (only the first 4 tasks for that one) and unless it got changed all you get from it is a discordant stone that doesn't even have the $$ anguish focuses =/</div></div><hr />

We went past him and killed the Chancellor dude and the Vision mob despawned at that point.  We werent sure what to do next so the bard went into the Leviathan's room and we all got kicked out of the zone back to SRF.  According to the task we were supposed to do something like free the Leviathan from his shackles or whatever (cant remember).  I would hate to think we have to go and fight all the way back to him since its a pita.  Any pointers would be great.</div></div><hr />

That's odd then, they must have changed the event at what is was originally.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
And not sure Nim, may have been changed after we did it... originally thought that was the lvl 69 spell mission and did it really early into the expansion.  Probably like the first weekend of</div></div><hr />
