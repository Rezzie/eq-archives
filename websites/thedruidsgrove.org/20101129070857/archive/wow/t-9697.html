<br />
I was in Alterac Valley for the first time this weekend, and well it was a bit overwhelming. People were nice and did take time to answer my questions and direct me, and I feel next time i get in I will do much better. However, I am wondering if someone has a guide/walkthrough/general strategy (Alliance Side, or in general) that they can direct me to, or if such a thing exists.</div></div><hr />

That sounds a lot more involved than the current BG system. I've only been in WSG though. Do the others have different premises? It would be very cool to have NPCs out there too, building your own army etc. I haven't heard anything even close to that description about the current ways BGs are run.<br />

It is a zone in of itself. Think Eastern Plaguelands in Size with quests inside to make your army stronger, quests for item rewards, etc.</div></div><hr />

 For alliance just remember Stone Hearth graveyard is key. If you lose that you will be fighting up hill trying to get through a serious bottle neck.<br />
 On a side note. Last night  I joined and AV in which the Hordlings were assaulting Dun boulder already. After a long fight they finally destroyed the towers and took the relief hut. After cleaning us out of the way they then started on the general, which they were having some trouble with. Maybe because I kept healing him for some time before they noticed me hehe<br />
 Anyways, all of the sudden like we flipped 4 graveyards, SP, SH, SF, and IB. Then we took our releif hut back and the next thing you know the hordlings were ressing way back at FW. About 45 minutes later we killed their general. Was the biggest turn around I have ever been in, great fun.</div></div><hr />

Alliance always get some epic geared Warlord who leads them all because he plays 10 hours a day.<br />
<br />
Horde... The people who play horde in AV are as slow witted as their tauren.  It's impossible to group all the questers, and farmers, and the idiots who sit there FISHING.  I swear... this kid sat there the entire game fishing!</div></div><hr />

Was so long time ago I played AV so I forgot where you get it. But i remember the assassin-ninja-GY teams i was in with rogues.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember where to get it? You had to bring something somewhere.. aaargh.. i dont remember. :-p<br />
<br />
No1 reason AV is the only BG alliance succeed more in is because the horde side usually lack healers.. and they always have 4-5 rogues (ud rogues ofc) trying to kamikaze inside the Ally-base trying to get a single kill (not helping their side at all).</div></div><hr />
