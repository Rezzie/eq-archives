<br />
never ever needed or looked for prismatic gems.<br />
<br />
i bought one of the new eternal belt buckles a couple days ago for my trollwoven belt and it was only after i got it and attached it that it seemed to say it needed a prismatic gem ?<br />
<br />
i cant find any on the AH !<br />
<br />
the only ones that were there were + all resist and the blue dragon's eyes that are used in some profs, like JC for them loverly Titanium epic items.</div></div><hr />

lol. thank you !  the few people i asked on friends list/in guild did not seem to now either!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes and currently there are only 2 prismatic gems I know of that aren't BoP, and you can only have 1 of each slotted.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafters can do a daily in Dalaran to get a token. They use these tokens to buy the prismatic gem recipes. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure you saw a Prismatic gem for sale with + resist. I only know of 2 BoE Prismatic gems; one is +6 to all stats and the other is +4 to all stats. All other Prismatic Gems are &quot;jeweler's gems&quot; and are BoP.<br />
<br />
If you see others, I'd be interested in learning about them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JC's have to buy other blue gem recipes using these tokens from daily's to i understand ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">btw - how does a JC get one of these very expensive Dragon's Eyes ?<br />
<br />
i want a few for the titanium earthguard items but they are like 300g or more each atm !<br />
<br />
are they got from actually being a high level miner and they are just low %age find ?  (in the same way that arctic fur for skinners seem low %age skinning chance!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm interesting. I'll have to check the AH and see what you're seeing. I've yet to run into a Prismatic recipe that makes a BoE resist gem.<br />
<br />
As for the Dragon's Eye, the only way *I* know of is to do the Jewelcrafting Daily. Next to the quest giver in Dalaran is a merchant who sells several things.<br />
<br />
One of those items is the Dragon's Eye gem for 1 token. Uncut it is BoE and can be sold. But it can only be used by Jewelcrafters for recipes bought with tokens from the merchant in Dalaran. Why someone would buy one of these rather than do the daily is beyond me. Truly it is 15 minutes at most for the token which buys a Dragon's Eye.<br />
<br />
ALL of the recipes are BoP and ALL of the gems are BoP. There are a select number of BoE items that can be made but they are all jewelry (neck, ring) but not a gem.<br />
<br />
Check out Thottbot for a list of items made from Dragon's Eye (http://thottbot.com/i42225#A::A).</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i have to buy the gems uncut cos i'm not a JC but i want a couple of items used by the gem.</div></div><hr />

Even if I undercut at 250 gold that would be 250 g a day extra! Forget about if I make and sell the items w/ mats.<br />
<br />
I'd say the frozen orb would be the harder thing to get though. Not sure what fair market value should be for an item that takes 15 minutes and typically 2 green Northrend gems to acquire. I'd be happy to hook you up if you were on Stormscale. :thumbup:</div></div><hr />

Here is the +resist gem you were talking about.  There is a rare version (not epic) that is +3 to resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">01-05-2009, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah okay that makes more sense. Enchanting not Jewelcrafting. And it doesn't require a Dragon's Eye.<br />
<br />
I verified at the AH and the gems were indeed selling for 280+ Gold each. Wow! <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the recipes cost 2-6 tokens so it could take several days to have enough tokens just to learn a recipe. Then some of the jewelry that can be sold uses 4 of these gems. So if you wanted to sell the Titanium choker, you would need the recipe which costs 6 tokens and the recipe calls for 4 more. So I've just spent 10 days gathering tokens to make 1 item. The more I make the more the 6 tokens is mitigated. Additionally, the only real mat that's hard to get are the tokens. Only Jewelcrafters can get them.<br />
<br />
So consider that a Dragon's Eye has a value. Currently we'll call that value 250g, but even if we said 50g the math works. That means I just spent, rather than sell, 6 tokens (1500 gold) to be able to make a necklace. That then requires another 1000 gold in gems alone. How much is someone going to pay me to craft them a ring if they supply the mats (which is typical) and they've already spent 1000g on 4 Dragon's Eyes? I think making my 1500 gold back will take awhile. Even with a 50G tip it would take 30 rings to break even vs. selling the gems.<br />
<br />
That's why people are selling them instead of making the item and selling it. The street value on this stuff is steep. And why would I buy a recipe that basically cost me 1500 gold when I can't wear it? I'd have to sell a lot just to make back the cost.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Its just supply and demand.  Right now there is a ton of demand for them cause everyone wants epic rings / necks, and as mentioned the tokens are needed to purchase the new recipies.  So pretty soon a ton of people will have all the recipies from religiously doing dailies, and the only thing to use those tokens on will be the Dragon's eyes, and they will flood the market.  The dragon's eyes will be super cheap in due time.  <br />
 <br />
Orbs on blackrock right now are selling for about 15g, and there are about 60+ of them up at any given time.  Same thing, supply and demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-12-2009, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree and disagree with you Clar.  Yes, the dragon's eyes are a result of supply and demand, and the price will fluxuate greatly, but not for sometime.  Most of the rare gem patterns are 3-6 tokens, and we haven't even seen epic gem stuff yet.  So yep, there will be an influx of Dragon's Eyes and the price will drop, but I cannot see them going for much less than 150g.  Between the patterns and the JC's need to have 3 of them in each gear set, I think their demand will stay high.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised to see the Dragon's Eye added to the badge vendor for 15 Emblems of Heroism or somthing like that, to help ease the pressure on the market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-13-2009, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could be right Clar - supply and demand seems to drive a lot of Wow prices just as it does in RL.<br />
<br />
borean leather has been going up and down like a yo-yo.  with small supply at the start of Wrath and obvious high demand from people levelling LW and wanting to make/use new LW items it was well in excess of 25g a stack for a while. Then it started to drop nicely and i was limiting myself to waiting til a few stack were around 12-15g.  then it dropped so you could pick up stacks for under 10g.  recently people started trying to push the price back up by listing a lot at closer to 20g - so i stopped buying. no its back down again :)<br />
<br />
i actually splashed out on 3 dragon's eyes yesterday.  225g each.  much cheaper than i have ever seen them and much cheaper than the other 10-15 on the AH whcih were 300-400g each. i was hoping they would have dropped to around 150g by now but i guess demand for items that use them and their relatively short supply is still limiting their price reduction.<br />
<br />
however i still feel that there is something inherently wrong with a profession getting a daily access to an item of such value.  i know several people who have levelled a JC just to get access to these items - both for their own use and to make 'easy' money on.....<br />
<br />
indeed Solar - i think the price of them will now take sometime to lower to a 'reasonable' level ! when are we seeing new 'epic' gem patterns ?<br />
<br />
i would be happy to pay 150g each to make something like the Titanium Earthguard ring i just was not happy to fork out 350g on average to make it !</div></div><hr />

Agreed...and guilty as charged.  I was skinner/LW forever, and finally sick of seeing my rare proc (Artic Fur) sell for 50g while the 20 min daily for JC was selling for 300g....it was time to make a change.  Also, as JC, for ~200g in mats, I got the best tanking trinket in the game, 3x Solid Dragon's Eyes, and a handful of other JC unique gem bonuses.  Looking back, its hard to see why I ever took up any other profession!</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah Arctic Furs are usually 60-70g still on my server Solar. i managed to buy up a few a few weeks back for about 40g :)<br />
<br />
Which tanking trinket are you talking about Solar ? something BoP for JC's ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even at 100g an arctic fur, it wasn't terribly profitable. There drop rate is pretty low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-15-2009, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">does that trinket require JC or could you level JC and get one and then drop JC ?<br />

stats on it ?</div></div><hr />

Take special note of the cooldown on the use!  It is absolutley epic for fights like with regular enrages or large incoming spikey damage.  Maexxana, or the boss with the 4 ads you have to sacrifice (enrages every minute...convenient).</div></div><hr />

<br />
although it was interesting to note that yesterday it appeared a bit of a Dragon's Eye price war started !<br />
<br />
someone sold 5 for 1000g !!! mega cheap. i bought another one for 199 gold. and am gonna try to resell for 300 :p<br />
<br />
others started pricing them at 260-280.<br />
<br />
whereas only a few days ago everyone in trade who replied to my request to buy a reasonably priced one wanted over 300g.<br />
<br />
i'm going to keep an eye on the situation this week....if they do come down i maybe able to make another Titanium item soon !</div></div><hr />

You can find the daily quest in Dalaran in the &quot;Trade Sector&quot; on the northside of town.  It's called Magnus....somthing. Its on the back of the &quot;Inscription&quot; shop if that is helpful.<br />
<br />
You can get the daily once your have your JC at 376+ I believe.  But you will need to be lvl 73+ to kill the mobs needed to complete it.  (Or have a friend to help you!)<br />
<br />
<br />
A pricing war began on our server for the Dragon's Eye's as well this weekend.  I purchased 4@200 each, and turned around and sold them for 280 each!  (Note: no charge to list Dragon's Eye on AH!  So price high and just keep relisting)  <br />
<br />
I suspect this week prices will settle around 250g.  The weekends are always volitile, which is understandable.  Every alt it leveling JC to get access to these gems.  Even if you only get 100g for one, thats a hell of a daily quest reward!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-20-2009, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed Solar, which is why for a few mins work on a mere daily its cr4p of Blizz to have given JC access to something so valuable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, no, you can easily do the stuff at 70.  Probably at 68.  I believe the combines require 370 skill, so that's probably the minimum to take the dailies.<br />
<br />
There's a regular quest you have to do first (it also gives you a token) that just requires you to hand him some green gems, then you can do the dailies.<br />
<br />
The dailies all have the same pattern: combine two different uncommon gems with a dropped item off any Northrend (creaturetype) to create an object, and return it.  All those types can be found and easily killed in Howling Fjord:<br />
<br />
Shoveltusk: wandering around the zone, obviously<br />
Scourge: various places, I like to hit the hill on the S end with the shades and such.  The ones down by the Murlocs along the NW coast work too<br />
Vrykul: I just hit that little camp just W of New Agamand, but there's also Jotunheim or whatever, the big town of them in the north.<br />
Elemental: or whatever it's called.  The small stone golem guys in the dwarf camp in the NE part can drop these.<br />
Protodragon: Amber scar, or whatever it's called, the burny area in the west.<br />
Iron Dwarves: all over the south.<br />
<br />
There are most of these (other than shoveltusk) closer to Dalaran than HF, but if you're low level, you always know where you can go.  I'm kicking myself I waited so long to do these -- my JC is a mage, I just bound him in New Angamand, and I can run the daily in about 5 minutes.  I made myself 8 eyes for my druid's gear, then used 4 more for my JC to get himself a recipe and 2 prismatics, then 8 more for a guildie to get a couple epic items, then today I'll get the 4th for another guildie to get an epic made.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, that's all I have in the pipe, then I can start selling them in packs of 4.  No wonder I'm poor.</div></div><hr />
