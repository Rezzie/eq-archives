<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saum02</div><div class="date">08-26-2008, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for ideas on how to spend some AA's. If anyone has any thoughts it would be apprecaited. I don't raid due to work schedule so most of the AA's that ive bought have been to be a group oriented druid. &quot;I dont really enjoy solo'in&quot;. I seem to do 50/50 between healing and DPS so i been spending AA's evenly between each catagory. <br />

 <br />
I have kinda run out of idea about where to effectively put the next batch of AA's. Any thoughts would be greatly apprecaited!!!  <br />

For the life of me, I cannot figure out how to view the AA tab on magelo profiles.  So I'm not quite sure what you have / don't have atm.  But here's my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
I solo quite a bit so I invested in the DOT critical affliction / Blood Tithe line heavily.  Although I do have a wide range of AA's with a total of 760 or so atm.  As a grouping druid, I can see you putting this off as there are more benefits you can get from other lines first.<br />
<br />
I saw from your magelo profile you are hovering around 370 AA points.  I would suggest to continue on your path mixing up the DPS and Heal AA lines.  Although for DPS, I should think you would concentrate on the Nuking crit line since mobs in groups don't last long for DOTs to be efficiently used.  As for the healer side, maxing out the Adept and Gift lines are vital.  I found the Respendant Cure line to be helpful as well (although I will have to look into how beneficial it will be to max this line - I'm at rank 4 for now and suits my purpose).  <br />
<br />
For an extra DPS boost - I found the Storm Strike AA to be incredibly helpful and fun!  Mana free insta nukes always being a smile to my face when they crit.<br />
<br />
If you're hurting in the mana recovery efforts, you can invest in the Mental Clarity and um.. that other one that increases mana regen cap from gear.<br />
<br />
I agree that denfensive AA's are also important.  Although I must admit I have yet to work on them much at 760 AA's.  When you do decide to build this up, go for avoidance first, then dmg mitigation.<br />
<br />
And of course - if you haven't gotten these yet:<br />
<br />
Exodus<br />
Shared Camoflauge<br />
<br />
I would make them a priority!<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S.  If you can share with me on what I need to do to view the AA listing on the magelo profile, that would be great!  :crazy:</div></div><hr />

You click the second circle from the top on the right hand side.  The tabs at the bottom change to character, group, raid and the buttons down the left correspond to the aa category tabs in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">08-28-2008, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Faellin!  For some profiles I can view those buttons.  And on other profiles such as Saumey's I cannot.  I'm posting in the Magelo forums to see if I can get some help resolving this issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">08-28-2008, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saum:  I replied to your original post on EQ forums.<br />
<br />
Zac:  My response was directed towards the OP, not to you.  This post of Saum's is a direct copy/paste of the post on Sony forums.  Rather than go find my reply over there and copy and paste it here, too, I'm just telling Saum go look there   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">08-28-2008, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tobynn - I'm not sure what EQ forums you refer to.  Is that here or on Magelo or Sony forums?  <br />
<br />
Anyway - Saumey - I was able to find one little pixel to click on and get the AA tab to pop up.  I see now my comments about exodus and shared camo were unneeded.  Sorry.  :banghead: <br />
<br />
Of course there is a fine balance between Druid AA's for dmg vs. healing vs. class abilities.  Below are my &quot;enhanced&quot; suggestions after looking at your specific AA breakdown.<br />
<br />
Healing AA - <br />
# 1 - Convergence of Spirits AA - provides a clicky base heal and extended HoT to a single target along with added AC / DS.  While there are nine ranks to this line, I find it very useful for a quick patch heal to group member or self heal when I'm on the run (don't have to stop to cast this one).<br />
<br />
# 2 - Fortified Survival - decreasing cast time and reuse time of this group saving heal is something I'm looking forward to working on next!  I just got the spell myself (yay Warmly Fangbreaker faction).<br />
<br />
# 3 - Max Healing Gift line.<br />
<br />
DPS AA -<br />
# 1 - The Storm Strike AA will definitely add to your DPS.  While it's only 1 nuke that has 2 possible hits and also crits available only every 30 seconds, it is mana free clicky .5 cast time!  I've gotten the 3rd rank and seen a double hit for for 1100 and one crit for 2200 or so.  That was 3.3k dmg for no mana.<br />
<br />
# 2 - I would go Fury of Magic over Destructive fury to increase chance for crit hits first. <br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retenion - a 10th spell slot is not necessary but can be very useful!<br />
<br />
Mana savings - Gift of Mana line<br />
You're at GoM 1 atm which affects the lvl 65-70 spells.  Gift of Radiant Mana will allow for similar procs to affect lvl 71-75 spells.  Gift of Exquisite Radiant Mana will affect our 76-80 spells.  These gifts of mana proc on both damage and heal spells.  I personally like using the gift for that Nature's Blazing Wrath nuke / dot since it costs like 1200!<br />
<br />
Agro management - Silent Casting has imo saved me from healing agro.  When multiple mobs are pulled but not picked up by tanks, it's easy for me to get wacked by the 2nd or 3rd mob.  I click the silent casting AA for added chance the mobs won't notice my heals and therefore give time for tanks to establish agro on all mobs (or get them mezed / rooted).<br />
<br />
Well, that's all from me!  It helped to look at this and review my own options for future AA purchase.  :icon_lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fuinniuil</div><div class="date">08-28-2008, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if your a grouping druid, i would suggest focusing on healing aa.  I prefer to be main healer in groups, or patch healer in harder groups;  debuffing and healing, since druid dps is rather low.<br />
<br />
So get fortified survival, its a total group saver and the rest of your healing aa, like healing gift. and also the mana regen aa, expansive mind and mental clarity help a ton, really speed up my game.<br />
Also when you finish off the gift of exquisite radiant mana aa, you will find your mana pool lasting much much longer.  If you act as main healer this one helps a lot too. ( but get healing aa and mana regen aa first, imho )<br />
<br />
For defensive aa, shield block helps a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damas</div><div class="date">08-29-2008, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my 2 cents. Nothing new to add after reading the other posts, but didnt see anyone mention radiant cure, if they did oh well it late and I skimmed through alot :icon_lol: . Def aas you will need but I would think if your grouping and keep an eye on your agro should be ok with holding off on def aas. But all I can say is exodus and camo as said before is a must, youll wonder how you ever played without them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saum02</div><div class="date">08-29-2008, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys i apprecaite they idea's :) Atleast now i have an idea of where to go next. <br />
 <br />
Yeah i copied my post from the SOE board. I wasnt really srue anyone checked here any longer. Traffic is deff alot less than when i used to play EQ.<br />
 <br />
Think im gonna knock out the GoM line, then Healing AA's though since i regularly group with a cleric. It will help with nuking too :)<br />
 <br />
Question about Shield AA ..... um how good is it compared to the otehr 2 Defensive AA's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saum02</div><div class="date">08-31-2008, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i busted my ass all friday and saturday and finally got the faction for Survival of the fittest!! so think im gonna have to get those aa's now too :(</div></div><hr />
