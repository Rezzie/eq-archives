I finally crossed the 1100+ damage line I set for myself a while back, but as I should have expected, my threat if off the charts! I have a feeling our newer tank may not be putting out enough aggro as the mage/lock in our group are also having problems, but I'm WAY above said lock/mage in omen. I just got the subtle cloak enchant, but was wondering if there is anything else I can do to decrease my threat? <br />

The only suggestion I heard from another person is to just use Cower which is in my opinion a big waste of mana.  You have to shape shift twice and stop dpsing for a good bit of time for it to be effective.  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping some people have good suggestions.  Void Reaver is a huge problem fight for me personally.  I have threat issues already on T6 tanks where I'm in Kara gear.  I shudder to think about what I'm going to have issues with once I start slotting in more badge gear and T5 equivalent gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Short of that, you just have to wait longer to start nuking.  I have to do that with my shammy or I turn to a greasy spot on the floor, and I don't even have that much +dmg yet :D.  You've got what you can get really to help the tank.  I don't like the trinkets that reduce your aggro, so I wouldn't recommend those.</div></div><hr />

I figured I might just need to exercise more patience really, I'll give the tank an extra 2 sec on top of my usual 5, lol, and try the cower, just to dump threat if I need to on boss fights. <br />

But yeah, when I was boomkin I made sure to stick with leather gear and had to watch my threat meter pretty closely.  IIRC when I dropped Moonfire from my rotation for mana reasons it made managing my threat a bit easier.</div></div><hr />

I'm a healer, and I run with GOOD tanks of all shapes and sizes.  But during a raid, no matter what raid it may be, our Boomkin will draw aggro.  And he tries to watch his threat, he really does, but regardless of his efforts, aggro will be pulled.<br />
<br />
So the above statement?  Should be a universal rule.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I can take a few good hits, it's getting better, I think our tank was focusing on gearing for armor and defence, but not much on threat. We're getting into a groove though.. and heck, I think that's why Blizz gave us leather armor, they knew we would aggro!<br />

<br />
I'm having the same issues, so this is what im trying. I have just started doing kara (i've been about 6 or 7 times). I can easily over threat and have to watch my meter very close, and I have Oomed on the prince almost every time. So im increasing mana regen and reducing +damage and adding threat reduction with cloak enchant and subtlety talent. Burst DPS and monster crits is great for Pvp but im starting to think raiding is much more subtle. Your in a team, ignore Damage meters. The boss going down is the main thing, not who does the most damage.<br />
