<br />
I absolutely loved it, sure it took a LOT of liberties with old fiction, but it was enjoyable start to finish.</div></div><hr />

I never cringed in terror, but I did cringe at the big bangs/explosions etc.<br />
<br />
If you like action, its a decent movie. Just don't go looking for massive character building, plot, etc.</div></div><hr />

Some story elements were really neat.. like the vamp/werewolf portion, but overall I think Hugh Jackman was a horrible choice for the role, and the actor who played Dracula was THE WORST dracula I have ever seen.  He gave off no feeling of &quot;i'm a badass.. fear me..&quot; there was a lack of bloodlust... he was all trying to be reasonable about only killing what they needed and stuff.  to me that doesn't portray the dracula that we all know and the dracula that we expected.<br />
<br />
The final fight was too CG... it reminded me of the Smith/Neo fight.  The fighting was secondary to them getting thrown around.  Even in a fantasy setting a fight should be somewhat believable. I felt like they focused on getting thrown around.. more than the actual blows landing.<br />
<br />
and yes.. I thought the ending should have been flaming rocks with body.. and then credits.... the airy bs was just some animator saying hey check this out... it added nothing to the story.. you knew her family was avenged because .. drac was el dead.  <br />
<br />
I laughed out loud in some parts of the movie.... and not the funny parts either.</div></div><hr />
