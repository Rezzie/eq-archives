<br />
I honestly, don't think it is that big of a deal, but I know that many players on PvP servers think it is a major injustice.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the whole world PvP thing is just plain stupid the way it works in WoW.  If they had a chicken system (where if you are more than X levels above a player you can't attack them) it wouldn't be nearly as bad.  When I leveled on a PvP server the only players that bothered you were those that were ?? to you.  Unless you ran into a pack of players.<br />
<br />
If X == 3-5 it would be ideal.</div></div><hr />
