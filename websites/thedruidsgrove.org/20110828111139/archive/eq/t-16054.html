 <br />
Any ideas? I got the helm from BW with the gear/watch drops and working on gloves now in DS. But, my feets are bad :( <br />
 <br />
I'm wearing repungant leather boots now and they are pretty sad! <br />
 <br />
I need something I can farm or quest, not much pp currently.<br />
 <br />
Thansk for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />

My guild is a family guild and most players are above or below me in level. Plus, I just came back after a long break. <br />
<br />
Just hit level 52 and got nifty gloves from the watch quest in DS.<br />
<br />
BB economy is worse than I remember. The repunant boots are around 500-880 pp now. I think I paid 50 pp when I bought them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are several boots (and other visible armor pieces) that you can make through tradeskills.  Boots only require two dropped items, and those items drop from just about any mob in a certain level range; you can also buy them in the bazaar.<br />

The one I have in mind:<br />

<br />
It involves tailoring and jewelcraft combines with trivials in the 230's, which you could reasonably attempt with a skill of 180 or so.  Assuming no failures it costs around 400pp plus two Sunshard Pebbles.<br />
