No easy way to finish it just loot at least 30 plunders and win. <br />
 <br />
Done the Orc and fairy mission in Kithicor forest. There OK. <br />
 <br />
Orc Mission:Only heard and tried one trick and that is after killings the chest one tank train the zone everyone else stay with the main guy  and fight your way out takes about 15 th 20 min. <br />
 <br />
Is there any others that have a neat trick for quick completion, which means faster exp and leveling. I know leveling to fast is not always good but I just want to hit 70 quick 2 lvl's to go. and back to aa's cause most of my skills were pretty much maxed at 60 so no hurting e there.<br />

Can someone explain the missions where you turn into a monster in POK or why do you turn into one if you change into something different on those mission. What is the purpose of walking around at another monster.(lizards and such) Do they have missions to do.<br />
 <br />

This just allows you to play as a different class, they have no missions to complete.  The more you play a monster the more &quot;XP&quot; you build up with that monster which eventually leads to more powerful monsters of that type (Undead, animals, etc).</div></div><hr />
