<br />
I know that many druids carry multiple sets of gear to aid them to whichever role they are called upon to fulfill.<br />
<br />
I'm curious how you adapt to carrying several gear sets in your bags?  How many slots do you allocate to gear?  I love the healing in instances and currently wear alot of intellect / spirit gear.  However, I'm thinking that I'd benefit from carrying gear that I can change into for dps / tanking for when I solo or am called to another role in instances.  I don't want to fill my bags with a 3 sets of different gear for dps, healing and tanking - so can anyone give some ideas of a set of gear that will allow dps / tanking that I can change into if needed.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for advice / suggestions<br />

<br />
I usually wear my caster/resto gear and have my feral gear in my bag.<br />
<br />
Here's my toons &quot;default&quot; gear:<br />

(Not I do have WildHeart helm and that I have to update my profiles sometime to show it instead of the &quot;Green Winter Hat&quot; which is shown).<br />

Here are my bags:<br />

As you can see one of the Travelers Backpacks is dedicated to additional gear. With the exception of necklaces and idols I use all the same stuff between bear and cat.<br />
<br />
In TBC once my Tailor toon can make 18 slots I'll probably grab one of those. As I carry by default a 1H mace and a offhand which means I need 16+1 when I swap to the staff in my pack for feral mode.<br />
<br />
I'm sure other people carry much more gear then I but this config has been working well so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">01-16-2007, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the only set that will allow you to both dps and tank while giving you the best results possible is the pvp set, unless ofcourse you can get your hands on Genesis gear.<br />
<br />
 Right now I think i have 28 peices of gear that I use to make up my 3 setups, healing, dps, tanking. My healing set is mostly Stormrage with a couple peices of Cenerian and the appropriate rings and trinkets. My dps (cat) set is made up of peices of the pvp set and bg gear and my Tanking (Bear) set is made up of peices from the pvp set and different gear that I have picked up raiding such as, Wristband of Stability from MC, Malfurions Blessed Bulwark from BWL and also a couple items that I have purchased along the way like, Cloak of Warding and a Wardens Staff.<br />
<br />
 I also keep all of the gear that im not wearing in the same 16 slot bag, plus a couple slots in another bag. Its been that way for so long that I just dont think about the loss of bag space anymore.</div></div><hr />

In the bank I have NR gear and whatever feral gear I wanna keep but don't wear much (lots of +hit gear if I ever feel I need it).  I'm a packrat too, which doesn't help.  It's a pain for grinding cause I have so little room for looting... I'm gonna have to put some of it in my bank for leveling again lol.  &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;  Everyone gets mad at me when they party with me cause I'm always like &quot;here, hold crap for me.&quot;  xD;;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it helps that I have 2 18slots and 1 16 slot and a 20slot herb bag &gt;_&lt;...<br />
<br />
ps. You know you cant put ironwood seeds in the herb bags since a patch or two ago =(</div></div><hr />

Switch it out for an empty one when not pvping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah thats just dumb.  You should be able to keep both druid reagents in the bag.<br />
<br />
I have all 16 slotters, and at any given time, the most open slots I have are 8.  Extra gear, potions, food, drinks, and I usually carry some enchanting mats and my enchanting rod on me.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to purchase another bag slot in the bank and another travelers backpack.  Another 40g down the drain &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repelsteel</div><div class="date">01-26-2007, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here, lots of gear with me. I wear my cat dps gear. I carry my full healing gear with me, aswell as the parts I use for tanking which mixes with some parts for cat dps ofcourse. I also carry FR items with me, and some mount speed increase items/items with mount speed enchants (I have an epic mount, but since pallies have +8% iirc increased speed, I can keep up lol). Overall I have about 3 Runecloth bags full of gear with me.<br />
<br />
I use ItemRack (http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1263) with which you can make different sets. I equip sets by an assigned key. For example &quot;I' equips tank gear and &quot;Shift-S&quot; my cat dps gear,&quot;H&quot; equips healing gear. And I made sets to equip healing gear + FR items (MC for example), and tank gear + FR items (boss from Rampage). And a travel set. This addon even contains events, so that for exampe when you mount it automatically equips the set you have assigned to that set (travel set in my case (Alt-Y manually)). I also used to equip +mana regen gear through an event for when I was drinking mana lol, went very quickie that drinking :)<br />
<br />
With BC I keep updating my gear sets in ItemRack lol. I keep my &quot;old&quot; blue gear in my bank, one bag to go b4 I have all bag slots full in bank lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-26-2007, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah with all 16 slotters i have at most 8 slots free time i carry all the pots, food and seeds needed.<br />
<br />
i need to slim down what i carry now for BC really.  Before BC i needed to carry tanking, kitty, healing and at the minimum FR set with Nature etc in the bank.<br />
<br />
however i still seem to need 2-3 bags for all the feral / healing gear i change out depending upon role.<br />
<br />
i use item rack to easily swap sets.<br />
<br />
its not easy if you want to be well prepared for filling all our possible roles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to have 30' someodd pieces of gear/trinkets on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">01-29-2007, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, try being a alchemist and see how much space you have. I carry 3 sets of gear plus extra resist gear. Add to that my herbs and vials and I usually have 4-8 open spaces for loot. Now, when I go to an instance...I'll stop off at the bank and deposit. I have all mooncloth bags on me and all slots bought with mooncloth bags in the bank and I still need to dump stuff once in a while.<br />
Oh, I'm a packrat, I tend to hold on to things like the ZF mallet, WP nerf trinket, and other specialty items I just can't part with...I know the day I destroy a guildy will say, &quot;hey man, wanna run ZF I just need you to bring the mallet&quot;&quot;, doh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">01-29-2007, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I carry 3 sets of gear: feral/tank, feral/dps, and healing.  I've considered carrying a partial nuke set around, but with the amount of DPS now that ferals can put out, I don't see that being necessary any more.<br />
<br />
Leveling up, my two feral sets have converged a bit -- the DPS is up on my tank set and my DPS set's gained a lot of armor and especially HP, but they still only share a few items.  Mostly, it's just allowing me to function decently in the wrong gear if I need to (and actually bearform in DPS gear is a great way to solo elites, PVP, and even DPS on big pulls with Swipe spam).<br />
<br />
Oh, and totally true about the mallet.  I ran out of bank space the other day, and actually in response bought out my last 2 bank slots, and put 16 slotters in every space... but I still have my ZF Mallet in there.  I've never actually even USED it.  I was in the Hinterlands at 60 one day after I took up Herbalism and said &quot;hey, while I'm out here, I should get a mallet just in case someone wants to go there some day.&quot;</div></div><hr />
