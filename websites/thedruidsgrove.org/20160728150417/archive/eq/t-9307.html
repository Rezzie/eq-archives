I THINK they can take you to 43 fast...but granted I havent done it in ages so my levels may be off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the F9 key while quadding Ulthorks with my 37 druid in EW. I put it to the far away view and slightly in front of me.<br />
 <br />
Basically my technique is run around ensnaring 4 hunters or warriors.<br />
Run around in a circle grouping them up.<br />
Run East towards coldain camp while pressing F9 and adjusting camera.<br />
Once the camera is set. Stop and cast lightning strike.<br />
Run till lightning strike becomes avail again, sit, count to four, stand and cast lightning strike again.<br />
Repeat until all dead or 1 straggler left.<br />
If there is a straggler cast stinging swarm on it and med till it dies.<br />
Put camera back to first person and loot bodies.<br />
Mem till full mana and repeat.<br />
 <br />
I've never been killed doing this and have also managed to actually kill 5 ulthorks a few times when I have picked one up by mistake. It gets untidy that way though. Also you make pretty descent plat as well and over 1 blue bub per kite. Oh one other thing, I'm not super twinked here and can still manage this with mana to spare</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendul3164</div><div class="date">09-02-2004, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lies. I did anything and everything to attempt the turn in while KOS back in the day. Invis/Illusion (it was a long shot)/sneak nothing worked. The walkthrough on these boards mentions that &quot;im sure you could do the turn in invisible..&quot; but does not say for sure any which way - and did not work for me.<br />
<br />
Hmm now im thinking about it - Feral Pack didnt exist back then. Perhaps this is the sneaky trick that now works - much like the wolf/frog faction help for the Crown of Deceit? <br />

Elaborate por favor.</div></div><hr />

The dorfs you kill (citizens) are on completely different faction then the dorfs inside.  Once inside I can walk freely.  Now if you killed guards or some other dorfs, that's a different issue.</div></div><hr />

At least from what I've read and I've been killing those dirty little dorfs since level 35.</div></div><hr />
