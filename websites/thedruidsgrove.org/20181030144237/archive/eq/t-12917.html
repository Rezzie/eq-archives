<br />
I think it will be unwise if SoE allows you to buy, for 19.99 USD, an expansion set that gives you all 10 expansions but only allows it to be used as a new account and to not be used against an existing account.  In essence making veteran players pay more for those &quot;missing&quot; expansions then new players coming in has to pay.  I've always felt veterans should get some kind of &quot;kick back&quot; for being as loyal as we've been.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get answered;<br />
<br />
When Titanium is available, if I buy it, can I use the CD-KEY to &quot;upgrade&quot; an existing account with any of the missing 10 that Titanium buys you or am I required to open a new account?</div></div><hr />

It lets them play all the available content without paying the high price. I just wish I would've know about this before I bought DoDH a few weeks ago for $29.99</div></div><hr />

The discs include the same content each expansion was released with.  Unfortunately you also need the 7 years worth of updated content and code that has been added to the game. <br />
<br />
In other words, be prepared for a fat patch session.</div></div><hr />

There was a note on eqtraders.com which quoted a press release date of Jan. 11 or so, but I'm still not seeing it.<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />

It took about an hour total, but patching only took 5 min. Then I registered at Sony.com and got my rewards. Of course, I already had all 10 expansions, I had the download versions of most of them tho.<br />
 <br />
I am not sure if you even need to do any of the above except register your new key card. I am not sorry I did tho, for some reason, it seems to be running a bit smoother now, not quite as much lag in PoK!<br />

Does anyone else see this as yet another sign of incompetence?<br />
<br />
How tough would it be for them to release it with all the patches in it up to the date of release?<br />
<br />
Instead, dial up people are forced to download for hours.<br />
<br />
A small thing but it kind of illustrates their lack of attention to detail that bites us in the ass all the time.</div></div><hr />

I had all expansions except DoN, and I was on a DSL connection. My comp sucked a bit, so I was only connected at 30mb per second and the patch took somewhere around 7 hours. Maybe an hour difference either way, I left it on while I went to sleep. I feel so sympathic towards the people on dial up, good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
