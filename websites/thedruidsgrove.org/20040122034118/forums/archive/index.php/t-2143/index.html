<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BaziloftheVale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all!<br />
<br />
I've been away from EQ for 2 years (since just after SoV came out) and am back playing my favorite class!<br />
<br />
I'll ding 14 tonight and want to start gettin' together a &quot;to-do&quot; list of quests to start/complete and hunting spots to check out. I'm in a real rut right now, hunting in all pre-expansion hunting grounds and my mind is a blank on the &quot;must-do&quot; quests I should start and the prime hunting spots to try.<br />
<br />
I have the Kunark and Velious expansions and will most likely get SoL soon. <br />
<br />
Could you fill me in on a few gems or point me in the right direction to read up on them?<br />
<br />
Thanks a mill! ;)  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are some nice solo spots, but most of my &quot;Must-See&quot; areas are more fun with an appropriately levelled group of friends.  These include:<br />
<br />
Guk 20-45<br />
Kaesora 35-45<br />
Howling Stones 45-60<br />
Dragon Necropolis 50-65<br />
Veksar 55-65<br />
<br />
Some of these solo spots are also fun with a group:<br />
<br />
Stonebrunt Mountains<br />
Emerald Jungle<br />
Chardok<br />
Western Wastes<br />
The Grey<br />
Umbral Plains<br />
Plane of Nightmares<br />
Plane of Tactics<br />
<br />
Most of these areas won't be available until after level 40 or so, I'm not sure what to recommend before then.  Paludal is interesting, and has a nice xp modifier.  If I were you, I'd try to find folks for a group if at all possible.  Good luck!<br />
<br />
As for quests, I strongly recommend:<br />
Thurg/Kael/SS bracer (even if you have to MQ it)  :) <br />
Circlet of the Falinkan<br />
Epic!<br />
Entrance to Plane of Tactics<br />
Rallic Pack<br />
Amulet of the Grey Wastes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BaziloftheVale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WOW! Thanks Quelm! :rolleyes: <br />
This is a great list to go from!<br />
I'll start reading up on those zones/quests right away! 0] <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gamilenka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you've got some friends to play with, you can do City of Mist from I think 40-50 or so.  Starts slowing down after 51, but still not bad.  Just need to pull with throwing items or a bow.   That place is never crowded, maybe just a group or two trying for specific epic pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wara Fairytune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not a druid but I guess a must do do quest for any mana burner and nice event ist the Coldain Prayer Shawl quest series.</div></div><hr />
