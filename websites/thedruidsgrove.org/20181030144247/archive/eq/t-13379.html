Aura of Life<br />
Health Regen Aura which cures disease<br />
Level 70<br />
Cast Time: 3.0<br />
Mana Cost: 400<br />
1: Decrease Disease Counter by 2<br />
11: Increase Hitpoints by 30 per tick<br />
<br />
I'm really hoping that Aura of Life is bugged and that the Decrease Disease Counter by 2 will be fixed to something like Decrease Disease Counter by 6.<br />
<br />
Because there is something wrong when a level 55 spell does better than a level 70 one.<br />
<br />
Also, the spell description in game for both says they remove curses, not disease.  I noticed that Aura of the Grove removed Tash while Aura of Life didn't.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to post this on Sony boards and hope they don't nerf Aura of the Grove as the 'fix'.</div></div><hr />

I also added: They should both remove all types of counters, much like the Radiant Cure AA.</div></div><hr />

/concur on Aura of Life, but I would leave Aura of Grove alone since making it remove all types of counters may trivialize RGC and the cure aaxp's.</div></div><hr />

I asked that Aura of the Grove stay at 4 counters and Aura of Life be adjusted to 6 counters.  We'll probably end up with grove counters completely removed and Aura of Life changed to cure curse counters 1.  =p</div></div><hr />

Yet it removes disease?  Is the scroll incorrect or the implimentation?<br />
 <br />
Would it be possible to get some clerification vie the means you beta testers have to clarify</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">02-24-2006, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It cures disease.  When Rytan first put a curing effect on this it was curse counters.  We told him that curses were much easier for a druid to cure than disease/poison counters so he picked one of those 2 instead.  The in game description is just wrong.  Tried many times to have him put BOTH disease and poison curing, but he seems to think we need to be handicapped I suppose when it comes to group cures.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I find curses are harder to cure due to the long cast and recast time on RGC.<br />
<br />
The only advantage of RGC over Pure Blood is that most curses are removed with one cast of RGC and some diseases and poisons take two casts of Pure Blood.<br />
<br />
That is really the fault of not having an upgrade to Pure Blood.  A level ~65 spell, 'Purify Blood' that removes more poison/disease counters is the real answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">02-24-2006, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is Rytan didn't want to make the aura a replacement to our curing, but to be useful in conjunction with our current cures.  If we already cure curses in 1 cast then it doesn't help us much really if the cure is meant to be used in conjunction.  An example would be 30 disease counter AE.  We cast pureblood once on each member and let the aura tick 3ish times to finish off.<br />
<br />
Example of a 30 counter curse or disease:<br />
RGC each group member once - 3.6 + 2.25 + 3.6 + 2.25 + 3.6 + 2.25 + 3.6 + 2.25 + 3.6 + 2.25 + 3.6 = 33 seconds<br />
<br />
Pure Blood each group member twice - 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 + 2.25 + ..(imagine a bunch of + cast time and recasts).. + 2.25 + 2.5 = 55 seconds<br />
<br />
30 Curse Counters (example of Aura of Life as a curse cure) - 6sec (4 cured) + 6 sec (8 cured) + 6 sec (12 cured) + 6 sec (16 cured) + 6 sec (20 cured) + 6 sec (24 cured) + 6 sec (28 cured) + 6 sec (32 cured) = 48 seconds to cure group<br />
<br />
30 Disease Counters (let's assume Aura of Life cures 4 disease counters and we are casting pure blood) - 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 + 2.25 + 2.5 = 26.25 to cast pure blood 6 times<br />
6 sec (4 cured) + 6 sec (8 cured) + 6 sec (12 cured) + 6 sec (16 cured) = 24 sec<br />
Overall we cure in 26.25 seconds as disease.<br />
<br />
Note: casting time on RGC was figured in with 30% bene haste (GET IT!~) and 10% spell haste buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sure hope they listen and bump it up to 6 for the lvl 70 - 2 is lame.</div></div><hr />
