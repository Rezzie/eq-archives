Please be cautious about downloading links if you notice any of the following:<br />
<br />
- Posters with very few posts, but posting several links to strange domain names<br />
- Posting direct links to ZIP, EXE or other downloadable files<br />
- Possible cut-and-pastes of official looking posts, but with links pointing to non-official sites<br />
<br />
If you do choose to download a file you're not sure about, make sure you have an up-to-date anti-virus program installed.  However, your best bet is simply: do not download files you're not sure about.  Virus scanners don't always catch some of the newer keyloggers.<br />
<br />
If you notice a suspicious post, please use the report post button and we'll take a look at the post as soon as we can.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue is that they are onRoll over events. So at times difficult to stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the mean time I would suggest using www.wowdb.com which is basically the WoWhead database with a different skin and no advertisements.  It's faster, too... (on my connection at least)<br />
