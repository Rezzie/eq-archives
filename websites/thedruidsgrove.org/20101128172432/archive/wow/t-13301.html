<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-31-2009, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well what can i say.....yesterday evening was fantastic.<br />
<br />
first we romped our way through Heroic UK in what seemed like not much over 30 mins !<br />
<br />
first boss dropped that very nice looking meta oomkin helm...Battle something or other. a nice upgrade for me.<br />
<br />
the last boss then kindly dropped the epic ring...Ann something or other which has diff stats to mine and maybe used in certain situations.<br />
<br />
so good loot, some badges and a fast fast run.<br />
<br />
feeling happy (and thinking tonite is my loot nite after a weekend of plate, plate and a little more plate) I said anyone fancy going to VH-Heroic ! after our issues on Sunday I thought another try would be worthwhile....who knows maybe Mr VW would stay home tonite !<br />
<br />
we had a guy i've known a while, a lock who does great dps and was one of about only 2 locks in BC I knew who could actually seduce properly. he raids so good gear.  he brought along a holy priest who turned out to be a superb healer.<br />
<br />
our major dps pally I know from another raiding guild had to leave as his wife was 'standing over him besides his pc' ;)   so i /w a mage I know very well...his alt is with us still and his other half is with us although she is taking a break from the game. he's in a big raid guild on his main so 25 man geared.  he could not come as was doing some pvp :(<br />
<br />
so i spotted his GM online - we've done a few 5 mans with this guy, also a mage - because his (the GM) other half is the sister of the first mage whose alts are still with my guild...if you follow me !<br />
<br />
he said yes so we were good to go.....the mage is an alt so blues and some epics. but he still does 2k dps which is pretty good to me !!<br />
<br />
we get to VH - first boss is the 2 headed thing that made me think i was back in MC ?<br />
<br />
2nd boss is the one i was fearing...always VW (remember this is only my 3rd time EVER in VH)....but no we get some jellyfish looking thing that would not have looked out of place in Arcatraz in BC ?<br />
<br />
Both of them bit the dust with ease. no deaths.<br />
<br />
So the big boss at the end - and tbh i was not sure what to expect. then some woman.....turned into a bloody huge dragon and the fight started. not understanding all the debuffs etc i got a little disorientated and i think out of sight of the healer whcih led to the blizzard and maybe more killing me.  but by this time she was around 25% so the 4 of them downed her.<br />
<br />
What drops ?<br />
<br />
STAFF OF TRICKERY<br />
<br />
:grin: :grin: :grin: :grin: :grin: :grin: :grin: <br />
<br />
how happy was this big bear turned temporary oomkin<br />
<br />
:texla: :texla: :texla: :texla: :texla: :texla: <br />
<br />
<br />
So i've now got my nice meta helm for oomkin to gem up tonite before we do some 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Plus a major chant for the Staff.....suggestions ?<br />
<br />
Is 35 agi still where its at or.......................</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Seconded. I used Mongoose on my tanking staff for a long time.  Just switched to 110 AP after picking up the Carrier Staff due to expected SD changes in 3.1 (ap based mitigation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">03-31-2009, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mongoose will boost your crit, your mitigation, your AP.<br />
I think it's still best for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-01-2009, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">does mongoose proc often then ?<br />
<br />
certainly would be nice with it proccing a lot and my Greatness Card and my other Card that gives various boosts to different stats including agi :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">04-01-2009, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">theoriycraft shows, that it's probably 21 from 60 secs active.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-01-2009, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a third of the time then :) sounds quite nice.<br />
<br />
infact mongoose even sounds nice for kitty dps if it procs a lot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">04-01-2009, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't work well for cats because they have a fast attack speed.  It is worst than +35 agi.  It works out great for bears because they have a slow attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">04-01-2009, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">another thing that makes Mongoose bad for kitty dps is that if you have Mongoose active when you Rip, when you go to frefresh Rip down the road a little bit, if Mongoose is no longer active, you will get a &quot;More Powerful Spell is Active&quot; message, and you won't be able to re-apply until Rip finishes.<br />
<br />
I'd really LOVE to get away from ALL my proc bonuses just to be able to crank out steady (even if it is a touch lower) dps.<br />
<br />
*edit* Gratz on a good night btw! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-02-2009, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheers skw.<br />
<br />
and cheers tlb/skw for putting me right on mongoose.<br />
<br />
i dont think i'll be going back to tanking tbh.  got to the stage i did not enjoy it and i dont like leading.<br />
<br />
so i'm reckoning on staying oomkin til 3.1 then looking at dual speccing with kitty dps (although i may and its a really big 'may' try resto....given as usual we're short of finding a reliable healer)<br />
<br />
although having said that both my guildies are levelling ones......the DK tank is finally getting through the levels on his holy priest and is not 76 and the other DK/Pally (healer but seems to struggle with healing as a pally?- no hots ?) now has a powerlevelled 66 ish Shammy.<br />
<br />
hehe Skw - i have lots of things that proc....2 proccing trinkets always, incl my very old Darkmoon Card for allowing 2% of your mana to regen for 15 secs whilst casting ! :p<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll check out Beserk - not sure what one does ? and the mats to as i know some of the high enchants need multiple Abyss Crystals which i've got none of and which are still cicra 100-120g a piece....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last nite qas quite good to...we blitzed UK heroic in about 30 mins and then carried onto VH-H (i still want a meta helm from there).  No VW boss which was :beerchug: <br />
<br />
The water boss is simple when someone uses the red knob.  then we got the one you have to kite. our tank is still a little unsure of that so luckily we had another DK who'd done it a few times so he took over tanking and we got him down plus the end dragon with ease.<br />
<br />
I still dont quite believe my recount but supposedly after UK-H i was at 2300 dps !  and i'm 99.9% sure it reset it before we started UK.....but that seems way to high for my level of gear.....</div></div><hr />
