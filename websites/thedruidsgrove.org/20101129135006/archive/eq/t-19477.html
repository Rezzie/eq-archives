I started playing WoW again recently.    I have a hunter and a deathknight that are both level 80.  I've had a lot of fun going back to the level 68-72 instances and soloing them.  My gear is mostly green/blue so the lower-level group content works out to be quite challenging.  It took my hunter 5 tries before he was able to take down Murmur in Shadow Labyrinth.  That's a fun fight.   There are a couple of instances in Shadowmoon Valley that have bosses I still haven't been able to take down.</div></div><hr />

Ironically I'm in a raiding guild in WoW.  But they're semi-casual friendly, they only raid 3 nights a week.  However they're pretty serious about the raiding they do.   But it seems like raiding in WoW is fairly casual friendly, at least sometimes.  The hard modes are seriously hard.  I like that they do that to keep the rabid raiders happy, but it frustrates the heck out of guilds like the one I'm in when we can't do it.  (Frankly, I'd just as well leave them alone).</div></div><hr />

I'm affraid that's not possible as it does not conform to with my mental image of her.  Perhaps more importantly, I'm pretty sure in a debate a few years ago she said something that implied her gender -- perhaps in one of the public breastfeeding debates we had back when Aidon still graced us with his presence.<br />

I used to do a lot of raiding back in the Molten Core and Zul'Gurub days but the guild I was part of was mostly Aussies and Kiwis so I ended up screwing up my sleep patterns pretty bad while trying to conform to their schedule.  The guild I'm in now seems to have a lot of angry kids who thrive on drama.  The only reason I've stayed with them is that some of the meltdowns that take place in guild-chat are pretty amusing.</div></div><hr />

Audrey Taotuo is adorable. Alot of European actresses and musicians, their humor and sexiness just comes across very natural.

Science fiction. She is quite adept at bringing across alien cultures and mindsets.<br />
<br />
Some series:<br />
Foreigner (stick to the early books, the later are a bit repetitive in theme)<br />
Merchanters universe (Downbelow Station is her most famous book in this series)<br />
Chanur (especially the first three stories. This is closest to space opera)<br />
Faded Sun trilogy (probably a bit difficult read)<br />
<br />
(semi) stand alone<br />
Rider at the Gate, and sequel<br />
Serpent's Reach (talk about a revenge scheme ...)<br />

Fictional mysteries, general murderish.  He has a few characters from the LAPD Homicide division he uses a lot, some from the FBI and even a lawyer.   Most murder mysteries the author sets up the bad guy and there's absolutely no surprise because you really don't like the bad guy.  But I have to say I'm usually surprised 90% of the time by Connolly's plot twists.  They're fresh.  <br />
<br />

I believe she's a sci-fi writer.<br />

There's another mystery writer with a very interesting plot development.  It crosses the lines between murder, horror and the supernatural.  His name was similar to Michael Connolly, like John Connell, or John McConnel... oh here it is:<br />

Well ... it is not all that hard to get in contact with the kind of models and artists I know.<br />

Fashion models are not intended to look anything like real living humans. They are meant to be moving, breathing (barely) clothes hangers (*). Their complete lack of curves is so they do not 'ruin' the lines the designer has envisioned.<br />
<br />
Of course any halfway decent designer two weeks in school can design clothes that fit well to a woman with more natural and healthy curves, but to make it look good they have to designed for a particular model. Since designers never know which model is going to show their designs things just get designed for an interchangeable flat clotheshanger instead.<br />

(* This is a slight exaggeration of course, but it is the general principle involved for haute couture. Pret-a-porter and lingery models occasionally are allowed a more natural look)</div></div><hr />

It is because of a practical matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
A camera uses a curved lens to project light on a flat surface.  <br />
<br />
This creates a photographic distortion.  It makes objects, in this case people, appear to be 'fatter', especially in the center of the field.  Of course the term aberration is more correctly used for the distortion at the edges of the field.<br />
<br />
Models are retained who are 'skinny' more because of that. if you were to meet a professional model who looks 'normal' or 'healthy' in weight in a photo, she or he will be very skinny in real life to you(visually speaking).<br />
<br />
A human eye uses a curved lens to project light on a curved surface.  The distortion from the curved lens is reversed by the curved retina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And pro lenses do not have any noticeable distortion.  I can take a photo of architectural details for you, using a good lens with a focal length that's close (relatively speaking) to your eye's focal length, and the lines on the resulting image will look exactly the same as the lines do with your eyes.<br />
<br />
You can even compensate to some extent in Photoshop for the barrel/pincushion distortion your cheap consumer lenses have.  There's an add-in that will do this automatically.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a view camera, pinhole(lens less) camera, PC lens, or postwork with PS.<br />
<br />
The focal length of the eye is about 17mm.  Most photographers, including architectural, would find that limitation too limiting.<br />

This is more a tv problem than a photography problem. Professional photographers can work around this problem easily enough, and at any rate it only is a small effect at its worst. No amount of lens effects can make the models shown by Klath appear as healthy human beings, and as the pictures show, it does not.<br />
<br />
This whole size zero business is a combination of designers not wanting models with much in the way of curves so they do not have to cut their design to take them into account (or they would have to know months in advance which model was going to show their clothes), and an old-fashioned race to the bottom where the thinnest, flattest model gets the biggest contracts.<br />
<br />
And no, it is not healthy. For what little good it will do, it is a good thing that at least one German magazine publicly stated it will only use (non-professional) more normal sized and un-photoshopped (or lightly photoshopped) models from now on.<br />

<br />
In the grand scheme of things it is not of the greatest importance. On the other hand it promotes a body image for women that is unhealthy at the very least, and more so because it is pretty much unattainable. Girls from a very young age are impressed with the importance of their appearance, and then are presented with an 'ideal' that is neither healthy nor attainable. It increases the occurance of low self esteem (and its associated problems), anorexia and other eating disorders, especially in young teenage girls who are already vulnerable and uncertain about their self image.<br />
The whole relentless 'girls have to be pretty' messages they are bombarded with is already pretty bad, but confounding it with an impossible ideal is not helping things at all.<br />

And no matter what culture you come from, I can assure you that the daughters will be more attractive to you.Sarah Palin's daughter is a lot less attractive than her mother, despite the age difference.<br />
<br />
I can think of countless other examples, of people you wouldn't necessarily know.<br />
<br />
But your bible is still entertaining, keep it coming.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm not a homo, but I can tell that Todd Palin, on physical attraction alone, is completely out of the league of Sarah Palin.<br />
<br />
She hooked up with him in high school because he was rich, one of the richest kids in town.  He had two cars/pick ups. <br />
<br />
Obviously if she would have waited until she became famous before starting to breed her prospective breeding pool would have been bigger, and with many superior specimens to chose from.</div></div><hr />

I think he is trying for Einstein's theory of relativity as to how it relates to mass and gravity bending light. I find that one slightly flawed though, do to the refractions of light from the structure though.<br />

I finally managed to see Trick R Treat the other day, after weeks long search. It was fun. Still trying to figure out why it didn't hit theatres.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, what I was trying for is better approximated by this. (http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/node/6799)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Arent you all entitled to your half-arsed musings on the Divine? Youve thought about eternity for 25 minutes, and think youve come to some interesting conclusions? Well let me tell you. I stand with 2000 years of darkness and bafflement and hunger behind me. My kind have harvested the souls of a million peasants. And I couldn't give a hapenny jizz for your internet-assembled philosophy.&quot;<br />
