I haven't really played my druid in wotlk yet, just my rogue.  Is healing instances with a combo-spec working out?</div></div><hr />

I actually healed Upgarde Keep the other day as feral.  So yes, but it is very dependent on Gear and the rest of your team.  I had a T5+ tank, and smart DPS (minimal splash dmg).  I would say with a PUG you could do it as Restokin, but not feral.  <br />
<br />
Also, it will depend on the instance you are running.  Nexus, for example, has a lot of splash dmg during boss fights even if your DPS is doing everything right.  That one might be a bit tough.</div></div><hr />

But if it's not an chaotic-run u should have no problems with it.<br />
I wouldnt go for a combo-specc.<br />
If u dont go full resto, the really good talents will not be taken.<br />
I would go full moonkin but with intensity in the resto-tree for mana-issues coming up on difficult instances.<br />
<br />
Was moonkin 2 lvls (70-72) but i intended from the beginning to go feral in WotLK so the last 5 levels (77 now) i went feral.<br />
But the 2 levels as moonkin i had no problems healing any instance (but it was a group of 5 skilled friends so it was easier than pugs)<br />

@Raging:  plz plz plz throw away your idol and put on a better one ;-D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This ends in heroics. Leave out some tanking abilities and your healer will hate u. Tried with kitty-spec my first heroic.<br />
Specced all the tanking abilities and it was much much much easier.<br />
I really was suprised how &quot;Thick Hide&quot; was lowering the incoming damage. So a must have!<br />
<br />
BTW: take CC into heroics. Groups of 2-3 mobs are ok. But 5 with 1-2 casters = whipe.</div></div><hr />

Its like a lot of things.  While leveling you can get away with it, but once you get to heroics you really need to have the extra mitigation talents.</div></div><hr />

Just far too many DPSer's around and as a healer i'm literally spammed with invites. Plus healing these instances at my gear level is a joke half the time i'm dpsing.</div></div><hr />

Put a &quot;undergeared&quot; tank/healer combo (read leveled through outland and went to Northrend at 68) you'll see how painful the instances can be.</div></div><hr />

Really?  I found Nexus quick and fun.  Though almost every run I've done there was with T5+ geared people who just tore through the place... maybe badly outgearing it has something to do with it.<br />
 <br />
I was kind of annoyed at Old Kingdom though.  Those elemental / caster pulls are annoying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It also has alot to do with not being in direct control of the healing. I find myself having to pop into caster form and heal because our healer thinks that &quot;Glyphed healing Touch is da pawnzorz nub.&quot;  or statements like &quot;My healing touch has a .9 second cast i'm so rockzorz.&quot; then i ask if they ever heard about the GCD and they respond something akin to....&quot;?!?!?GCD?!?! wuts dat?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a thinly veiled plea to all english teachers. My grammar ain't gud butz itz harderz fo mez to type like diz. I could probably go on about this for another three pages but i'm going to just stop now.<br />
