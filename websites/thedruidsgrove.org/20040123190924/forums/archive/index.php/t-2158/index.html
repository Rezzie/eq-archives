<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ytryy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me what is a good way to setup my spells and hotbuttons for soloing them... Help is greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mugwye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just like any other mob you would root/dot.  Only difference is root breaks more often.  Oh, also do a search on these forums for elysian remains.  There is only, oh...., about a couple thousand posts on this subject!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LilWolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">being 53rd will help because of the new DoT.<br />
<br />
a free DoT will also help.<br />
<br />
a free root will DEFINATELY help!  I loose a good chunk of mana for roots alone.<br />
<br />
patience is good too.<br />
<br />
But they are easy.  Root, dot, dot, dot... wait for break...root... break...root... dot, dot, dot...continue for 15 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
No special hotkeys/spells.. /stand /cast root... and /stand /cast dot.... But don't resit... you will ALWAYS want to move farther away before you resit.<br />
<br />
Figure out which dots are worth it (mana/damage wise).  They are VERY fire resistance, so forget the RO line completely.   <br />
<br />
Also, get in a group of druids whenever you can!  it REALLY REALLY speeds it up!  I always thought that it more then doubles the kill speed having another druid... mainly because whoever doesn't have agro is the root'r.<br />
<br />
Horses used to help alot...  But I don't think they will be acceptable anymore..<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gimli fan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Patience is certainly the key.<br />
<br />
It will take quite some time, and you may have to flee after a 10 - 15 minute battle with nothing but your life.<br />
<br />
Grouping is also a great suggestion. Often there will be one or more Druids their with no pieces, or all but one piece. There will be a few pieces you loot from the kindness of strangers.<br />
<br />
Always start at full mana with a regen, watch out for the pathing when you pull them back so they don't run away or warp on you....and really really try hard not to get hit. They crunch bones so play it safe.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to port out if you get in trouble. You may loose a kill but at least your are not eating experience.<br />
<br />
Search for a complete guide in stategy and the archives.<br />
<br />
Lastly be sure to call out when you get a piece you can not use so that someone else may be able to pick it up.<br />
<br />
Luck in travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chlorala Bructeri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A couple of suggestions that have worked for me:<br />
<br />
If you are a Tunare druid, the Warden Symbol is a lifesaver for stuff like this..free clicky root.<br />
<br />
Use your epic if you have it for a free DoT, or get some ES Vambraces for the free DoT.  <br />
<br />
Invis up before you go looking for an elysian.  Corrupted elysian remains are about the ONLY thing in UP that doesn't summon.  If you get agroed by a summon mob, remember that they have a 20 sec timer on their summon.  More than enough time to root and cast egress.  <br />
<br />
Never be to proud to egress if things are going badly.  If other druids are around, make them aware so your mob doesn't come crashing down on them.  It's better to live to fight another day than have to ask a guild cleric to make the run from Dawnshroud.<br />
<br />
EDIT:Mi gramer are moste impeckable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>willain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My spells lineup (at 52):<br />
ensnare/49 root/best heal/ best nuke/dot 1/dot 2/39 root/chloroplast<br />
<br />
I have my ES arms, Tunare necklace, and escape crucible hotkeyed, and I stay in wolfform because it lasts longer.  With KEI, I don't have a mana problem, and can generally use the 49 root for its duration.  If I get a resist or two, I'll usually hit the clicky root.  I do have spell haste and mana preservation III items, which are useful - the lvl 39 root casts very quickly.<br />
<br />
I've tried an assortment of groups, and they all are vast improvements over soloing.  The best I've been a part of by far was 3 druids and a shammy - the shammy slowed, healed, and sent pet in, the druids dotted, and nuked.  We (the druids) alternated pulling and simply aggro-kited the skelly up and down the valley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>smeeha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another thing I was VERY thankful for was SoE.  When I finally got that, Elysians became much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The advice here is already pretty good.  Only thing I'd change is the root level.  I always used the level 5 root since the elysians break root easily anyways.<br />
<br />
The trick to elysians is the pull.  I usually ran around with SoE for this.  You want to invis and head over to the wanderer area on the far side of the safe corner (from VT).<br />
<br />
What you want to do is aggro pull the elysians while invis.  So long as you stay invis you're unlikely to get adds during the pull.  You'll need to get the ranges and timing right to aggro pull them while giving yourself enough room to turn around and run away without getting hit.  This is where levitate helps a tonne.<br />
<br />
If you DO get hit, you'll get adds.  Run far away along the zone wall and away from safe corner out of courtesy for other groups and egress.</div></div><hr />
