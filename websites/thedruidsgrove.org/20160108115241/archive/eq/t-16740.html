<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-09-2008, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been trying to find fun doable quests since my return but I am currently looking for more. Anyone that has some suggestions please pass them on.<br />
<br />
Main prereq is that they be soloable at 70ish (for the newly returned, I started most of this stuff at 65 when I came back at the beginning of April) or a 3 man group doable scenario, preferably solo, but in some cases you may only need a group for one or two encounters. I am normally alone or duo with another druid my level when I am questing.<br />
<br />
Here are what I have done so far, or have in progress:<br />
<br />
Epic 1.5 (need some help in a few spots but a lot of this is very soloable, information is all over this board so not going to repeat whats done)<br />
<br />
Many of the quests below overlap with what and where you are hunting so you might as well get the benefit from more than one at a time if you can<br />
<br />
<br />
Icefall/Valdeholm/Steppes<br />
Ancient Tomes (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3715)<br />
Nice Mana Pres VI aug from Valdeholm<br />
Gnolls in NE corner by the Giant wall were the highest success rate<br />
<br />
Gorbak's Bag (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3725)<br />
Camo to quest giver, have /say ready, get quest and evac<br />
Follow same procedure on turn in<br />
** see Gorbaks other quests since you will finish them by default anyway<br />
<br />
Kregnad's Knapsack (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52765)<br />
Same procedure as Gorbak but wait until Kregnad paths to the highest point above or lowest point below dogs for best success rate<br />
<br />
Cull the Gnolls (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3879)<br />
Kind of worthless except you will auto finish it so you might as well, quest comes from Crescent<br />
<br />
Toegnasher's Token (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52149)<br />
Not superb augment but easy to get overall<br />
<br />
Runic Ivory (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3891)<br />
Faction only, but again, you will finish by default of the other others<br />
<br />
Armor Supplies (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3665)<br />
Nice bracer prescratched etc<br />
<br />
Shattered Gift (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3989) this must start with My Pretty (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3609) in Steppes<br />
I am halfway through Shattered Gift drops, but faction isnt what is needed yet in Valdeholm. The sword drop in My Pretty is a bit of a bear to get but I have seen them rot when other groups are there killing for another reason and have asked nicely and been allowed to loot the one I needed.<br />
<br />
I am sure I am forgetting a few but if you kill mammoths, bears, gnolls, kobolds and have all of these quests + the 2 extra from Gorbak and Kregnad you will complete all of them together. Some will require faction, but the faction you need can be also received (mainly Valdeholm) by repeating the Runic Ivory and Armor Supply quests.<br />
<br />
Big bummer... if you are trying to get Orc Faction the Orc quests do NOT give faction. Sucks, but thats the way it is, but you still get the bags out of it if you want.<br />
<br />
Haesgrin #1 Incursion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3939)<br />
nice shield but a little tricky to do<br />
<br />
Orb of Duskmold (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3670)<br />
this is a heal/buff clicky but you need access to the back of the mines through this quest Access to Ancient Ruins (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3707)<br />
<br />
Thinning the Pack (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3610)<br />
Kobold quest, shaman type pet with mana regen buff, can be cast while you have a pet and you get buff but no pet<br />
-- I cant get this quest for some reason but still trying, it didnt work for me the way the orcs did at KOS state, he ignored me and everyone else charged me :)<br />
<br />
Stonefed Chip (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=64379)<br />
Orc faction again, must be quick or get faction, nice aug<br />
<br />
Orb of Mystic Fury (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=53286)<br />
easy quest, starts in Steppes, nice aug<br />
<br />
Others<br />
Charm of Lore (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52354) that plus this at the same time Wanderlust series (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3680)<br />
Makes a very nice charm and augment combo that is relatively easy to get to high stats alone<br />
<br />
Jonas Dagmire's Skeletal Hand (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=67072)<br />
Long TBS quest and there are a ton of mini quests but its an excellent hand augment and druid heaven to hunt in.<br />
<br />
Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3527)<br />
does involve PoG so faction may be an issue for those that helped on guild raids in the old days<br />
<br />
Tinmyn's Oil Can (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=69861)<br />
nice level 80 charm, but kind of a pain imo based on how stats are calculated on coin you carry, nice at max stats though<br />
<br />
 Shop Keeper's Delight (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3396)<br />
Decent ring for casters, earring for melee - looks fun, havent tried it but its likely not an upgrade for most people doing these things ie. Dweriun Trio is better<br />
<br />
Crossfire (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3394)<br />
Looks soloable for at least half of it, but a group would knock this out in no time for a nice augment<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I am running out of quests now, need more soloable and fun things to do for my partner/group and I!<br />
<br />
I am also looking for missions I can complete alone if I get a group to add me so I can snag the task and then they can drop me. I have friends that multi box 2-3 and could add me for tasks and then either go to bed in GL or do whaetever they are doing while I go collect doubloons/crystals/etc so if anyone can point me to some that I can do I would love it!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">06-10-2008, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Duskmold&quot; is a quest that I would highly recommend.  I _think_ it can be soloed; you'll need access to inner Vergalid first, which is a separate mini-quest that can also be soloed, though it's much quicker with help from a group.<br />
<br />
The reward is a self-only Symbol clicky (700 hp), which is extremely helpful when there is no cleric around.<br />
<br />
I also recommend &quot;Thinning the Pack&quot; if you do not yet have a mana regen clicky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrian</div><div class="date">06-10-2008, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duskmold can be soloed if you are patient, but it is much much faster with a group or a couple of bots. It's a great item to have either way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-10-2008, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I will look into Duskmold quest.<br />
<br />
I cant get &quot;Thinning the Pack&quot;. I have tried twice and he doesnt give it to me when I do the uncamo /say standing behind him. I get out with Exodus fine but he doesnt even respond, so I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or my kobold killing has hurt me there. I am still KOS with orcs and get their quests so I am not sure if the kobolds work differently or I did something wrong. Gonna try again tonight. I wanted to make sure I could get it before I posted it. Maybe I need to go through the /hail and then /say dialogues... but that is different than the orc quests if so.<br />
<br />
Still cant complete the Haesgrin #1 Incursion (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3939) either, I never get the guy to spawn before we get owned down the stairs. Not sure if its a bad luck RNG spawn issue or they changed it, but I am going to keep trying. I have seen posts where it has taken multiple attempts to get the named to spawn near top. I am 3 for 3 of failures there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">a_druid_99</div><div class="date">06-10-2008, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to sneak to get Thinning the Pack (I'm a halfling although I imagine Gobbie shroud works as well). <br />
<br />
Another one you can do is Stonefed Chip in Icefall for a nice augment although you may eat a few deaths there unless you are incredibly fast on the hand-in or have a friend train out most of the room. There's a corresponding aug from the Kobold side that requires you to kill the mob you are handing chips into, but I did not do that.<br />
<br />
Orb of Mystic Fury was a very easy augment to get - no combat, just running around. There's a post on the forums here, somewhere.<br />
<br />
Haesgrin's Incursion worked for me about a month ago - I'm sure you're using this same strategy but just in case: I used /say move once, then spammed /say stop until the mob spawned. Helped kill and then spammed /say stop again until I got the update.<br />
<br />
Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters is also an easy cloak to get via quest, 165 hp/mana.<br />
<br />
I'm currently working on the Skeletal Hand Aug and Tinmyn's Oil Can (lvl 80 charm).. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-10-2008, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I forgot about Orb of Mystic Fury, thanks.<br />
<br />
I hadnt tried Stonefed due to where he is in the room but I would assume he works like all the rest of the Orc ones, since I am slaying kobolds already I had kind of put that on the back burner until I had the faction.<br />
<br />
I didnt try sneak actually, on Thinning the Pack... I just got behind him and drop camo like I had with the orc stuff. I will try that and see if I have better luck that way. Its only minor damage to orc faction, I would assume, since I would like to keep that for a short bit so if I am unable to pull off Stonefed without the faction there it will be repairable to allow me too. The Thinning is a better quest to finish anyway in my opinion.<br />
<br />
And yeah tried the same strat on Incursion with no success yet but I will keep going back, at least through 5-6 attempts, until I take a group in there with me and get it done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sneak worked for me for both Thinning the Pack and Stonefed Chip (handing in the chip breaks sneak I think, got me killed twice when I wasn't fast enough with Exodus).<br />
<br />
Also, there are some PoR tasks - Crossfire for a nice aug and A Shop Keeper's Delight. I haven't done Crossfire, unsure if a druid can solo Master of the Herd - and A Shop Keeper's Delight was actually fairly interesting, killed a few of the supply runners but hard to find a place without roamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">a_druid_99</div><div class="date">06-10-2008, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two other quests came to mind that I did for fun: <br />
<br />
I picked up a Coldain Ring 8 for the clicky when soloing summoning mobs or powerleveling. It was a lot of fun to redo that quest. (I came back naked unfortunately)<br />
<br />
I also went to Velks Lab and got my pulsing frozen heart for epic 2.0. I know it's going to sit in my bank forever, but it was lots of fun going through the castle as the last time I was there, it was a full blown raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did this recently for my warrior (like, last week or so). It works fine. In fact, the named pop after about 60 seconds which was a big surprise as last time we did it, it took about 5 minutes of 'stop' spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-11-2008, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I think I am just having bad luck with the Incursion. Gonna try again when I get back from Cancun next week :) I am kind of swamped between now and my departure. There have been other reports of the same thing I have seen though. So maybe we are letting them get to far into the steps, or not far enough.. not sure. Are you guys letting them get on the steps at all?<br />
<br />
I came back after 5 years and was on Coldain 7, guess I should go finish that one up too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">a_druid_99</div><div class="date">06-11-2008, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say move and then stop about a second later, they dont' leave the room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-11-2008, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks, I did that the first time and never got a pop after a min or two so I started trying to get them partially down the stairs. Never worked the next two times so I will try again in that room alone. One nuke in the first foyer down the stairs and I am toasted lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-12-2008, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shield accomplished. I got him to spawn at the top finally and lost the first battle... doh!! However the reason was I let them get to close to the stairs so he wasnt able to be hit by all of the giant troop and he beat Grethmar, barely. I had him at 6%.<br />
<br />
Went back and didnt let them move more than a step and he popped again almost right away, all giants were able to assist so it was a quickie battle.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder if the last patch (two weeks back) messed something up and the one this week (first one this week) corrected it as it was cake last night and all my problems were in between patches.</div></div><hr />
