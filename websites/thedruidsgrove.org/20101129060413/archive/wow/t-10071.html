<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireth</div><div class="date">02-14-2006, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...  as some of you remember I posted a while back about being totally owned by a warrior 3 levels below me.  He was 24 I was 27.  I thought it would be an easy kill and made several tactical errors and I was killed.  <br />
<br />
<br />
After listening to the advice of many of you here and getting a bit more experience I was able to test my skill again last night in a similar setting.<br />
<br />
While in Wetlands a lvl 29 Warrior challenged me to a duel.  He was a Private in rank so I knew he had at least some PvP experience.  I have no rank as I rarely PvP.  I am lvl 32 currently.  <br />
<br />
We go into the street and I accept.  As soon as the counter counts down I root him and cast a starfire.  It hit him pretty hard and took a nice chunk of his hp.  Roots break and he charges me and I was stunned for a sec.  I cast regrowth on myself and re root him.  After healing to full I drop to bear and go toe to toe with him.  Bashing when its available.  When I needed a heal I switch out, root him, heal, and at this point he was fairly low health so I go into cat and tear him down.<br />
<br />
When I won he was very surprised.  He apparently doesnt lose often.<br />
<br />
I accredit the knowlege that I have largely to this forum.  <br />
<br />
Just for fun I switched out of my thick murloc chest to my Green Whelp armor and asked him to duel me again and told him I would not fight back.  <br />
<br />
I dropped to bear and he attacked.  He was napping in about 20 seconds.  lol..  he was pissed.<br />
<br />
I let him kill me after he woke up just to be a good sport.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireth</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I thought the GWA was pretty nifty.  I purposely didnt use it in the first duel as I wanted to see if I could win without it.  The fact that I won without it gave me a little confidence boost.  I really like the thick murloc armor (except that its pink) for the stats.  I usually still wear the GWA while out running around and XPing though.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've crossed the threshold with my GWA that the other level appropriate stuff has so much better stats I'm wearing it less and less.  If I need to tank an instance in bear, or we don't have a decent tank and I keep getting aggro while casting, then I'll put it on (and I still always put it on for duels), but most of the time I'm wearing my jinxed hoodoo stuff.<br />
<br />
I am also about to hit 50 soon, so I'm hoping it will kind of align with the patch date to allow me to part with my GWA on natural terms rather than feel like Blizz is just ripping it away.</div></div><hr />

Before we nab the flag or go try to break their turtling tactics, Ill self sacrifice and run right into the middle of their group in bear form.  When my raid sees that I died, they know at least a few of them are sleeping and its time to move in lol.  Best ever I actually had 4 of the 8 sleeping around me so when I died, it turned it into a 9v6 match for 30 sec lol.  Usually lucky if I sleep 2 before I die though lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The nerf shortens the sleep effect from 30 to 10 seconds, and makes everyhting over level 50 immune.  It should still be useful from 35 (I think thats the min req.) until close to 50 (depending on what you are fighting).<br />
<br />
The main reason for the nerf was 60s wearing a piece of 35 armor dominating in the BGs (leaving trails of sleeping attackers while they dart off with the flag).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I started wearing it at 30, I'm 35 now and have been wearing it for awhile now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-17-2006, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no idea, but there have already been a couple little bug fix patches on 1.9 so it can't be too long.  Typically you'll see the patch notes posted on here as soon as they're available and the patch will be the next maintenance cycle or so.</div></div><hr />
