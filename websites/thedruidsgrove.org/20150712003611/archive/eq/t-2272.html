Stick figures are quaint but quickly going passe.  Take pride in your class.  Use something profound and true to describe yourself, like simply &quot;Chicks Dig Storm Wardens&quot;.  But make your own =)<br />
<br />
2) Armor the cleric as best you can with hp gear, just like any other PLing project.<br />
<br />
3) Treat it like any other melee.  They have decent AC and more hit points than a ranger, they just do less and less damage as the mobs get higher.  As long as you get that one point in and let the DS take care of the rest, it will be slow go but doable.<br />
<br />
4) Lower Guk Dead Side, undead nukes, need I say more.<br />
<br />
5) At 50, you are either going to have to go legit, or start PLing a second melee and letting them both level at the same pace.  Without reliable melee damage its near impossible to PL casters by themselves<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Load up on the HP/AC gear, cast thorns and pull a train to your cleric.  Keep your cleric healed and have him chain cast his PBAoE spells (whatever the low level version of upheaval is, tremor?? don't remember).  As long as you do at least one point, the thorns will take care of the rest :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pull and beat the bejeebies out of a mob.  You can egress if near the egress point or have them atone once the mob is almost dead to wipe your agro.  Then have them walk in and kill it.</div></div><hr />

As he increased in level is started using the strategy of nuking once with wildfire/moonfire and Atone and stealing xp.<br />
<br />
At 42 now I'm looking for mobs that I can nuke once with wildfire/moonfire and do most of the damage while the cleric Atone's for the Xp.  <br />
<br />
Any ideas of 35/36ish MOBS that will go down to about 40% using one nuke?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to an area where mobs are low red to your twink. Load up PBAOE on the twink (clerics get it at lvl 9 I think). Buff up your druid with AC regen and thorns (the more DS the better). Use the druid to pull as many mobs as possible, and wedge yourself in a corner so you can self heal if needed. After mobs are down in health a little, walk your twink up into the middle of them and cast the PBAOE. <br />
<br />
*IMPORTANT*<br />
As soon as the PBAOE goes off, back up imediatly, out of melee range of the mobs. The druid DS will hold agro on the druid, BUT mobs will attack the twink if he is within melee range. <br />
<br />
Let the mobs kill themselves on the DS, snareing and rooting the last one if he runs (use low lvl or no dmg root, mob will hit you until it's dead). <br />
<br />
If there are enough mobs to be had, you should get half a level per pull through the high 20's. <br />
<br />
Places to do this: <br />
- lvl 1 start at Field of Bone. YES druids are KoS to the guards and crusaders, but if you stay in the pit you should be safe from them. I never had a problem with them. This is THE best place to level though 12ish.  If your twink does not have PBaoe, you can substitute AoE blasts or dots(necro) and do 4 mobs at a time. <br />
<br />
- Kurns tower might be good for another level or 2. <br />
<br />
- lvl 15ish, yard trash in Unrest, moving on to house mobs and basement mobs as they turn blue. Most of the skells wont run so they are nice to pull. Gouls are terrible, they run at low health even if other gouls/mobs are nearby. Avoid pulling Gouls (gotta leave something for everyone else right?). <br />
<br />
- 20ish, head to Mistmoor Castle and own the zone. Everything agroes here no matter what your level. Everything is social, so only the last mob standing will run at low health. Watch track, you can hit the castle and take out some named mobs while your twink meds and pick up some neat items. Start with pond mobs, and move towards castle as you need higher lvl targets. This zone could get you to 40ish, but I think it would be best to find a new dungoun in the low 30's. <br />
<br />
My current twink is lvl 25. I plan to stay in MM till 30ish, and then hit Droga to 40+. <br />
<br />
Once the twink becomes LB to you, you should be able to group and share exp. At that point, go quad somthing thats green to you, OR PBaoe kite if you can. Twink should level up fast enough. I did a friends enchanter from lvl 46 to 50 in a few hours of charm kiting PoD while grouped. <br />
<br />
Everytime I see someone say melee's are easier to PL than casters... I just shake my head. This method is insane exp for a cleric twink, PLUS you dont have to worry about raising melee skills as you would with a melee class. Casting skills are easy enough to raise in Nexus with a KEI and PoTG (dmg spells give skillups here but do no dmg). <br />
<br />
have fun,<br />
