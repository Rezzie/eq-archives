<br />
Basically, anything that changes the structure of the tree (number of points in a talent, what's in what rank, what feeds what) they have to do it, or there could be invalid specs.  They can get change what talents DO, but not the structure.</div></div><hr />

This thread on the Euro forums has a Blizz post regarding Imp LotP:<br />
http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=84108466&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=13<br />
<br />
&quot;The developers felt that the Imp LOTP talent was too strong due to the increased health pool sizes in the Burning Crusade. Given the fact that bear tank health totals of 15000 or more, the Improved Leader of the Pack talent can be used to heal over 3000 health per minute, for just the bear, let alone the rest of the party, mana free. It is very similar in strength to Judgement of Light, but never wears off, costs nothing to apply, and will scale as players get better gear, unlike Judgement of Light. &quot;<br />
<br />
Even though they've nerfed it, I'm thinking there might be more nerfs or changes in the future for this Talent :-(</div></div><hr />
