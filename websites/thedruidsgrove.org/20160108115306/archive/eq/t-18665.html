I quit around GoD/Omens time, but I never did those areas. Last I remember doing was SOME Planes and LDoN, mostly Luclin stuff (I loved Umbral Plains). Anyway, I am in need of money now, but I have no idea where to farm for stuff to sell anymore. I'm level 60, preferring an area I can solo. Anyone got some advice?</div></div><hr />

You really don't need much - a few dozen gems, and you can afford a pretty full suit of new gear - the nice thing about returning after five year is the stat inflation on gear.  Before you know it you'll be over 10k HPs, with max flowing thought... it's mind boggling if you're still thinking of game as you once knew it.<br />

If it's a merc you're after, they're not that much either - maybe 1k upfront, then 20pp or so every 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />
