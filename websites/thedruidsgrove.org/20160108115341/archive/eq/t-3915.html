<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">01-07-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is to fully understand the &quot;Resistance Check: Magic +25&quot; line [for a root spell]. <br />
What does this mean exactly?<br />
Higher number more/less resistable?<br />
Does this 25 get add/subtracted to targets resists?<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that it takes the creature's MR stat, and adds 25 to it. So, a creature with MR of 40 will have 65 (40+25) for the purposes of this spell; that is, it's easier for the creature to resist this spell than some others spells with lower modifiers.<br />
<br />
The figure is also scaled for difference in level between the caster and the target; if you're higher level than the creature whom you have targeted, the number goes down (so your spell has a higher chance of landing); if you're lower level than the target creature, the number gets scaled up.<br />
<br />
If caster and target are both the same level, the &quot;MR + modifier&quot; is the base percentage of your spell landing. So, for PvP vs. someone your own level, 100 in each resist is the goal (excluding extra resistance to counter debuffs).<br />
<br />
It used to be that super-high level creatures (Velious 75s and so on) were extremely hard to hit due to the massive level difference - the chances of your spells landing (and you would have to be level 60, also) were usually small; in the larger caster patch a number of weeks ago, this effect was reduced of course and we can now land spells much more easily on the super-level NPCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;How do rechecks work for resists, ie why does 1 root last 1 second and another 120 seconds?&quot;<br />
<br />
After the initial creature resistance is calculated, there are a number of checks at periodic intervals, depending on the spell. At each one of these intervals, the creature has a chance to break the spell if it is of the 'breakable' casting type (duration formula) - whether it be root, charm, &amp;c. <br />
<br />
Creatures with higher natural MR of course will succeed in one of these periodic checks with greater frequency than a creature with lower MR.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Any idea how levels play into it, lvl caster vs lvl target?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oopsy daisy, I answered that one at the start; the formula for extra-high differences in level has been significantly changed from the PC-to-NPC end. <br />
<br />
Level 59 players trying to cast on a level 75 NPC used to have the creature's resistance scaled up to 400+, a nearly impossible target.<br />
