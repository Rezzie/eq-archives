The one on the left did 52,904 in total healing!!  And almost all of it landed to heal missing health.  The one on the right saved my life and only took 0.5 to cast, for the mana cost it is very reasonable imo.</div></div><hr />

Yes but you're missing the point Xarra, if you can't naked one group Lethar 2.0 and keep your group's life at 100% the entire time, the spell will never be good enough.</div></div><hr />

Do I really have to point out the sarcasm? Really?<br />
 <br />
I thought adding the naked thing would make it that much more obvious... I just knew I should added that pic of a clown, some smileys and a bunch of lols.</div></div><hr />

I use this spell every time its up even if im only healing one tank.  It's like a 0.5 casting druid CH for the tank, you just need a tank that doesn't sweat when his hps go to sub 25% every 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
1. When you get its associated AAs, and<br />
2. As the equivalent of an &quot;omg someone is (or we're all) gonna die&quot; saviour that has been exclusively* cleric-domain until now (unless you count CoS...), which was nearly every time it refreshed last night just exping in Steam Factory, and<br />
3. When you have the 10th spell gem AA (see 1. above) for it to live in. Permanently.<br />
 <br />
(* Not counting evacs or DAs, which both interrupt the ability to &quot;keep going&quot; and maybe as unusable as CoS in some situations anyway.. I'm referring more to Divine Arb type things where this spell gains its inspiration from).</div></div><hr />
