Nobody uses it anymore, but when you click the geography link and see the posts about zones and mobs, you see the posts dating back to 1999.<br />
Ahhhh what memories this brings back when folks discussed forming groups to fight Orcs and Dervs :)</div></div><hr />

I was parked on the wiz spire in WC waiting for guildies to do their turnins, and got poked by a Minor Werewolf.<br />
<br />
Yes, that event is happening again, and dropping the same loot from 2001.<br />
<br />
Man, that was a scary thing for my little 20's bard.  People screaming that the 'ubers' were ending the event too early.  The red con Werewolf Overlord who wiped folks and dropped lots of uber loot.  Wondering if Dragoon Zytl was gonna come along and slap me from behind.<br />
<br />
Just not the same at 70, standing there one-shotting woofs, nonstop, without any sort of clarity...but the memories were nice.</div></div><hr />

Our lvl 16 Warrior helped us kill it. Man what a fight.<br />
I recall when they would &quot;re-pop&quot; a zone and announce it, when you were hunting in that zone i think the mobs spawn cycles would start over.<br />
From what i recall in March 2000 this happened in South Karana at the spires, after the re-pop announcement we got attacked by a werewolf. I had no idea at the time that werewolves lived in SK. <br />
My last encouncter with a Werewolf was when i just turned lvl 24 and I travelled around Norrath killing everything i could that night.<br />
I recall running into TWO yellow conned Werewolves in close proximity in West Karana. I had never heard of TWO of them travelling together. I singled kited both of them and I thought I was such a tough guy :)</div></div><hr />
