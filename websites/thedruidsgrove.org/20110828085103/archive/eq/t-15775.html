I've found alot of info about gear, but alot of it states details about DoN and other later expansions that I dont have. The last expansion I got was Gates.. And I got that, played that for about 2-3 weeks, then vanished.. So Im very behind.<br />
<br />
Im quite lost when i log in my druid. I've been tempted to just go back to my old hunt in PoS, but I feel quite under-equiped and missing spells.. <br />
Here is a quick Magelo: http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1355509 <br />
Dont think i got everything, but I got the equip right. <br />
<br />
Its been so long and I've played so many other games that I dont know too many of the right tactics anymore. I went back into PoN to just see how well i do against ravens and I nearly got myself killed. which bothers me as I used to do that in my spare time with ease. <br />
<br />
I've done alot of searching but anyone have any extra ideas for someone thats never ventured to far into PoP let alone anywhere else beyond that? Also Isn't there a new compilation set comming out soon that will have all the latest expansions that will help me get back up to speed?</div></div><hr />

I put &quot;box set&quot; in quotes because you'll be able to digitally download everything but the box and catch up to The Burning Sea.<br />

At your level I think I was soloing Vxed:  snaring a mob and dragging it to the zone line and zoning to break agro on the adds.  Zoning back in to rot the mob at the zone line.  Restarting the instance to avoid the stonemites that summon.  I think Halls of Honor off of Plane of Tranquility might work for you too, but I never did that zone solo.  <br />
 <br />
The search engine works great now:  search for Vxed and Halls of Honor and I am sure you'll get a lot of ideas off those threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll have to check it out. Thanks.  I've been trying to Charm Kite Frogs in PoS right now and just died 3 times.. had a few kills then been making those famous rookie mistakes like not making enough space or not watching close enough to what else is nearby and getting smacked. I'll probally de lvl to 63 at this rate but all in the life of re-learning and I'd rather relearn solo then attempt to group and get them all killed cause I dont have the survival skills down yet.</div></div><hr />
