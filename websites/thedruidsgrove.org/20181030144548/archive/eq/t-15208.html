<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-13-2007, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SAN DIEGO, Jan. 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Sony Online Entertainment LLC (SOE), a global leader in the online games industry, today announced EverQuest® The Buried Sea(TM), a new expansion for the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), EverQuest. EverQuest The Buried Sea will only be available via digital download beginning February 13th, for the suggested retail price of U.S. $29.99. <br />
 <br />

 <br />
&quot;As the new producer on EverQuest I am very excited to have this tremendous opportunity to work on such a storied franchise, as well as be part of a development team that has delivered successful expansions time and time again over the past eight years for our many loyal EQ players,&quot; said Clint Worley, Producer, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;As the thirteenth expansion for EverQuest, The Buried Sea will continue to challenge players with two new worlds to explore, ship-to-ship combat on the open seas against swash-buckling pirates, and a variety of new missions created especially for this expansion.&quot; <br />
 <br />
&quot;The success of EverQuest is both a tribute to our devoted player base and our very committed development team,&quot; said Christopher E. Sturr, Senior Global Brand Manager, Sony Online Entertainment. &quot;EverQuest continues to deliver innovation, new features and challenging new content, which will be evident in The Buried Sea.&quot; <br />
 <br />
The Buried Sea will also feature the ability for guilds to create a unique Guild Banner from a large selection of symbols and colors. The banner becomes the mark of the guild and when enough guild members are in the same zone, the guild leaders or officers can plant the banner in the ground. Once the banner is placed, members of that guild are able to teleport directly to that banner. In addition to the banners, players will have the ability to acquire Energeian items, utilizing ancient Combine technology; they can gain access to a new inventory slot that can be fitted with an Energeian power source and armor that can tap into the energy held within. <br />

About EverQuest The Buried Sea <br />
 <br />
Throngs of undead trample the earth both night and day as Norrath's sun withers. With each passing hour, the growing numbers of creatures of the night rising from crypts and graves seem part of a grand design to overwhelm the lands. Trouble also lurks deep beneath the Buried Sea off the coast of Odus in a city named Katta Castrum, which has remained undiscovered for millennia. It is a city built to sustain the beloved leader of the Combine Empire who was poisoned. Generations of Combine Loyalists have tried to cure and awaken him while they house threatened populations of Kedge, Shissar, and Sphinx. But in recent times, the artifact that powers and protects their city has weakened. Without it, the city will be crushed under the pressure of the sea. Only the most intrepid Norrathians have the power to save them. <br />
 <br />

There are some nice new features - especially for late commers to the raid, aka instant coh. However $30 bucks US ( 45-50 after taxes in Canada ).....it's a bit on the greed side. I could understand $19.99 for a small update expansion so soon after a major one but this one may just rub folks the wrong way /rant off</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, dealing with pirates on the high seas shouldn't have quite the same difficulty as taking on, say, the pantheon of gods.... but I guess they had to come up with something :)</div></div><hr />

I never entirely understood the appeal of the pirate genre but to each his/her own I guess!</div></div><hr />

Purple prose aside, Paladins will be very happy.<br />
<br />
in a city named Katta Castrum <br />
Er? Castrated Cat? :confused:<br />
<br />
 Ship-to-Ship Combat <br />
Boats 3.0?? Ouch!<br />
<br />
dive deep beneath the sea <br />
Enduring breath AA ftw!<br />
<br />
more than 60 challenging new missions <br />
Missions can be fun as long as they are not mindless MMs and don't turn into root/rot fests.<br />
 <br />
your fellow guild members can teleport directly to it! <br />
This can be nice for both grouping and raiding. Reminds me of the WOW player summoning system.<br />
 <br />
Get together with a group of your closest friends and <br />
start your own fellowship!  You can join in a common chat channel, gain <br />
the ability to create a campfire that can help you in your adventures, <br />
and get a token that will let you quickly travel to your other fellowship members. <br />
Depending on the minimum number of players required to form a &quot;fellowship&quot;, this could be useful for travel. The campfire feature sounds like an update to totems/wards, which haven't been all that popular, but we'll see what they can do.<br />
 <br />
The armor gains power based on the type of energy in the power source, so you can quickly customize the effects of your armor by changing the power source! <br />
Healing sources vs. DPS sources for priests? Tanking sources vs. DPS sources for melees? Could be interesting.</div></div><hr />

Anyone else connect the dots there?</div></div><hr />

I LOVED when you had to take a boat from butcherblock to freeport.  &quot;HOLD HE BOAT!&quot;... Made teleporters actually worth something.    I still took boats when they were around even though I could teleport - it made the game more enjoyable.  Glad to see some boats are coming back.</div></div><hr />
