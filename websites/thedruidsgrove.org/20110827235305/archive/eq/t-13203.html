I am proud of what I have done with my druid, and really enjoy playing it. Everything I have, has been earned on my own with pickup groups, and my AAs were picked, for what seemed like fun at the time.<br />
 <br />
I am a full time parent and full time at work, so I have never applied to a raiding guild, realizing it would be to hard to commit to playing times. Also the 5 people in my guild (hehe) would do anything for anyone, so hard to leave such good people....they are also casual players that do not have the levels or AAs to put any type of 5 person guild group together.<br />
 <br />
So, my silly question would be: is there anything obvious I should do different with my AAs or equipment, or did I answer it all with what I said above?<br />
 <br />
Magelo is my name, thanks for the time!!:)</div></div><hr />

Shared Camo.  Get it.  Its Great.  Everyone who has it loves it. Fixed duration group instant cast invis.<br />
<br />
I would recommend finishing off some things as well, Healing Gift Mastery, Radiant Cure, Chaotic Potential, Convergence of Spirit, Expansive Mind, Destructive Fury in that order.<br />
 <br />
If you heal more than you nuke, definitely finish HGM first, if you nuke a lot more than you heal, then I would say DF first but just switch those 2.<br />
 <br />
Others to look at, Persistant Casting, Mystical Attuning (if you ever have problems with needing more buff slots or just are laxy like me and don't want to keep clicking off haste and sense).  Also, a couple fun ones just to have to play with, not really all that useful are Nature's Guardian and Wrath of the Wild.  But only if you want the toys.<br />
<br />
Thats a pretty long list I know, but others I am sure will suggest a different order for those.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
1 Rank Radiant Cure<br />
Healing Gift Mastery<br />
Convergence of Spirits<br />
<br />
Then the others.<br />
<br />
This drastically increases what content you can heal for, esp once Convergence is maxed out.<br />
