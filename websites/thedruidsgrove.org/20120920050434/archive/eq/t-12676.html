<br />
If IRC the Nature's Boon 5 was 50 healing and a range of 50.  Yes?<br />
<br />
Also, I am wondering if it would be good for Jelvan or if the AE effect makes it too dangerouse in terms of spreading my groups aggro to another group.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
sry, you were probably after an answer but I don't have one.  just had to pick on ya<br />
 <br />
expect to get a lot of &quot;i think blah blah blah&quot; but ultimately useless answers for this one</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">11-22-2005, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope, but there's good number of people that clutter post with &quot;I think blah blah blah blah&quot; statements that don't answer the question, don't shed any light on the discussion, restate things everyone knows anyway and only serve to annoy the original poster.<br />
 <br />
I get embarrassed for those people</div></div><hr />

It is a simple question, what is the Healing on the different levels of Boon of the Forrest and is the range still 50.  I am looking for an answer, not a way to waste time trolling the boards</div></div><hr />

I marvel at people who can make sence out of Lucy -- it confuses the hell out of me!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Take it step by step. Start with Burst of Fire and Minor Healing and Skin like Wood.<br />
 <br />
Etc..<br />
 <br />
It's not that difficult.. Always notice the &quot;Stacking&quot; link in upper right corner - spells there might be more known to you and make more sense.</div></div><hr />
