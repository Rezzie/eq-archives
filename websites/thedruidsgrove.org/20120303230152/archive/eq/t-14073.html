 <br />
My question is, how can I get access to the best druid quests by level?  I paid for the subscription at http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ but am still struggling to find this out...<br />
 <br />
Thanks a ton!</div></div><hr />

HaonaHi Haona, I'm on the Sleeper server too.  Level 8 Druid.  So far, I've just been killing random mobs while running back and forth between Kelethin and Freeport doing the Deliver Mail Quest for the Bards.  It nets me a little over 2pp round trip.  Although, it would probably be better if I just get in on an Orc Hill group or maybe find a group in Crushbone.  I hear levels are more important than equipment at this level of the game. But I'd sure like to increase my wisdom so I'll have more mana to cast spells.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">07-21-2006, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found that wisdom hasnt been that important just yet...<br />
<br />
I have been killing red/yellow aviak guards in Lake Rathe.  And kited the Milleres in Qeynoes Hills when they conned red/yellow with only 103 wis.<br />
<br />
Going to start working on wis gear once the prices drop some and its time to quad kite =)</div></div><hr />

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1753<br />
Very easy, easy quest for your first set of Focus Armor. (Extended Enhancement I)<br />
Helps increase the duration of all 1-20 spells. <br />
 <br />
Wee Harvester (Do-able at Level 1)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=494<br />
Also another very easy quest to do. This is a great starting weapon with a decent amount of +wis. It always takes you by the Bear-Hide Boots NPC so you can complete both quests at once.<br />
 <br />
Paw of Opolla (Do-able around level 25)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2320<br />
When your ready to upgrade your Wee Harvester it's time to get two nice hand-held items. This is one of them. Paw of Opolla is sometimes a time consuming quest but very easy for it's reward. It took me around 6-8 hours total to finish this quest. Give it a shoot, it's a very rewarding feeling to finally get it.<br />
 <br />
Testament of Vanear (Do-able around level 15)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2336<br />
To compliment your new Paw of Opolla, you have the Testament of Vanear. Quite possibly the easiest quest to do for a nice +10 wisdom Book. Only issue is the availablity of the quest NPC. He is camped round the clock, especially on the Combine Server.<br />
 <br />
Polished Bone Bracelet (Camp-able around level 20)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=785<br />
Best camp EVER. Me and my Bard friend camped the Evil-eyes in the Gorge and in a matter of 4 hours, we generated around 300pp in Gems + Loot. Go there, now.<br />
P.S. Polished Bone Hoop drops there also. They are starter earrings that just add Mana if I'm correct.<br />
 <br />
Chipped Bone Bracelet (Camp-able [alone] around level 30-35)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=809<br />
Amazing Bracers for three reasons.<br />
1) Non-Lore. You can have TWO!<br />
2) +5 Wisdom<br />
3) Afflication Efficiency II Focus. Decreases the mana cost of all DoTs. (Two Similar Focuses Do Not Stack)<br />
Very easy camp once the spawn is broken. The Chief is a bit difficult, but Root + DoT = dead Chief. MAKE SURE HE STAYS ROOTED. If root breaks, and you are rooted. Your dead.<br />
 <br />
Bat-Fang Headband (Camp-able [alone] around level 30-35)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1400<br />
Same camp as Chipped Bone Bracelet. Great cap with Extened Enhancement II Focus, upgrading your Beat-Hide Boots.<br />
 <br />
Aviak Charm (Camp-able around level 26)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1145<br />
Besides the +1 wisdom for the neck piece which is a plus. The main reason for this item is the Burning Afflication I focus. This easily increased the damage of each one of my dots by 5-10 damage a tick. Very worth wild neck piece.<br />
 <br />
Kejekan Tribal Headband (Do-able around level 25)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6611<br />
No real experience doing this quest, but the reward is well worth it.<br />
 <br />
Pearl Kedge Totem (Camp-able around level 30)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2318<br />
Something I am still camping at the moment. In Dagnor's Cauldron there is a named goblin that dorps this +18 Wisdom hand-held item. My best advice to you is the following. When you sign on, go to Dagnor's, run around the rim of the lake and check track. No goblin, no problem. Leave and enjoy your day. When your done EXPing/Questing for the day, head to Dagnor's and check on the goblin. I guarentee if you follow this process at one point you will catch the Goblin when he's up.<br />
 <br />
Reed Belt (Camp-able around level 30)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=959<br />
Drops off of Blige the goblin in Dagnor's also. In addition to having great wisdom on the belt. (+5 Wisdom) It possesses Burning Afflication II! (I want this! :))<br />
 <br />
Braided Ivory Cords (Camp-able around level 25)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1021<br />
Great +Wisdom shoulder piece. Everytime you go to Mistmoore to EXP, check track through Lesser Fay. You might catch this fella on track. I happen to finish exping in MM and was sellin at the mercant in LFay, when I heard him fighting the guards outside. Unfortunately the mob was near death so I couldn't get the Cords.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
This is some low-mid range items easily aquireable for us druids out there. Hopefully this helps. <br />
Take care.<br />
Message me on Combine if you need any more help/advice.<br />

If so that is out of the game atm.  I would love to do those quests but I'm a halfling :shuffle: <br />

It even has 3wis/3str on it.  The name is eluding me at the moment though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot speak to if this is original EQ or added when the armor quests were but it is low level (mob whose head you need is level 10) and magic and old world.<br />
<br />
Worth a check.<br />
<br />
And in the 20's you might want to camp the Flame Goblin Foreman in Sol A for the Obsidian Scimitar:<br />

<br />
Do druids have a set of armor for the 20-30 level range?  A lot of classes have Sol Ro quests and I was surprised not to see anything there listed for druids.  A friend reminded me that warrior quests are in another zone so maybe the druid quest guy is hiding somewhere else also? <br />
<br />
I'm getting read to do the quests with my normal group of cleric/sk/enchanter/druid so want to figure out where all the camps are so we can hit stuff that overlaps together. :)</div></div><hr />
