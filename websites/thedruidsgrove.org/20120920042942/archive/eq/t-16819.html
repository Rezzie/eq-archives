<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bavaral</div><div class="date">09-04-2008, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone knows whether the AAs that have increasing cost per level also have a corresponding increase in benefit.  For example, take Healing Gift, the first three levels cost progressively more but it also states that the benefit also increases.  Does level 13-15 have a greater benefit than 10-12 or do those levels just arbitrarily cost more?  The final five levels on combat agility/stability I'm also wondering about.  The cost progression on Expansive Mind increases for no additional benefit so I wanted to see if there were any answers out there.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

After that, you are going to start seeing diminishing returns whether it be healing AAs, damage AA's or survivability AA's.  The more you accumulate, the harder you have to work for ever decreasing benefits.<br />
<br />
Perhaps someone can provide details regarding the specific lines in your inquiry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilluan AB</div><div class="date">10-29-2008, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's look at Healing Gift:<br />
<br />
The first three ranks of this ability grant you a chance to score an exceptional heal at 3, 6, and 10 percent. <br />
Additional ranks further increase the chance by 2 percent per rank. An exceptional heal doubles the healing value of the spell.<br />
<br />
The corresponding AA costs are:<br />
<br />
2    4    6    2    3    4    3    6    9    6    6    6    7    9    12<br />
<br />
So you get in steps:<br />
<br />
19% HG for 12 AAs <br />
6% HG for 9 AAs<br />
6% HG for 18 AAs<br />
6% HG for 18 AAs<br />
6% HG for 28 AAs<br />
<br />
I worked up to the 4th group and I can say it is worth it!</div></div><hr />

The first three ranks of HG add up to 10% not 19%.<br />
