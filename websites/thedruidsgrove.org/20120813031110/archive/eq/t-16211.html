 <br />
The general concept of this is get tons of mobs, lets DS eat through them, then have the toon getting powerleveled PBAE the mobs and get all the exp. This works from levels about 10ish-60 (50-60 is dependent on druid's gear as the mobs at that level hit for alot). <br />
 <br />
I'll start by saying which classes can do this with ease.<br />
Clerics, Druids, Magicians, Necromancers, Wizards, and Bards all get spells or songs that are PBAE at a low level and can begin then. Warriors, Rogues, Paladins, Shadowknights, Rangers, Berserkers, Shamans, Beastlords, and Monks all get weapons that proc a PBAE DD. Enchanters as far as I can tell are out of luck except for 1 potion which I will mention later.<br />
 <br />
Clerics get Word of Pain at level 9<br />
Druids get Tremor at level 21<br />
Magicians get Fire Flux at level 1<br />
Necromancers get Word of Shadow at level 20<br />
Wizards get Numbing Cold at level 1<br />
Bards get Chord of Dissonance at level 2<br />
Warriors get 4 weapons that proc a PBAE -<br />

If money is no object to you and you do not feel like camping any of these weapons you can buy http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28045 from Zordak Ragefire in Nagafen's Lair for 1050pp, or 262.5 a click (I seem to recall the last time I saw one it was 8 charges not 4, so I will check this out in game).<br />

 <br />
If you are unable to get any of these weapons, unable to afford the potions and the class doesn't get a spell or song that is a PBAE then just assign an easily accessable hotkey for cycle NPC and put attack on and whenever the powerleveled toon sees a hit (you can make an audio trigger if you like) hit the cycle NPC key until you see it again then rinse and repeat. Just remember to have a magical weapon if doing this in Lower Guk.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Now as for the druid spell set when Powerleveling, I personally always use a setup similar to this:<br />
 <br />
1. Fernspur/Fernspike/Frondspur(finishes off mobs quick or named mobs that outlived trash)<br />
2. Ancient Chlorobon(quick heal for the powerleveled toon and for gaining aggro)<br />
3. Pure Life/Puravida/Granvida(you're main heal)<br />
4. Adrenaline Surge/Swell(Emergancy Heal + possible Mitigation)<br />
5. Promised Renewal(Nice quick heal for when you are being pushed alot)<br />
6. Hungry Vines(PBAE snare, extra DS, Mitigation and faction hits if you want them)<br />
7. Vineclash Cascade(optional, but useful. PBAE knockback root gets mobs off the powerleveled toon quick and it stops them from running)<br />
EDIT:<br />
8. Survival of the Fittest/Felicitious (This is your emergancy heal)<br />
9. Wild Growth (ever since Reptile's nerf I've looked for a replacement buff, and it came with SoD, an extra 4-5k HP is awesome for PLing)<br />
10. Virdifloral Bulwark(In some of the lower level zones the mobs die to your high DPS before you can get them back to the person being PLed, get them all to the person let them PBAE once then cast this on yourself.)<br />
 <br />
Buffs<br />
Any HP buffs, HP regen, Mana regen, AC, Movement and Damage shield help. I usually use Symbols Orb, Direwild, FoE, Virdicoat, Virdifloral, Mask, Oaken Vigor, and Aura of Life. Then some random clickys to take dispells if I'm facing it.<br />
 <br />
DS:<br />
Virdicoat - 20/21/22<br />
Virdifloral Shield - 66/69/72<br />
Hungry Vines Recourse - 45<br />
 <br />
EDIT: Level 76-80 Spells<br />
 <br />
Virdithorn Coat - 23/26/28<br />
Virdifloral Bulwark - 76/86/93<br />
 <br />
EDIT: Level 81-85 Spells<br />
 <br />
Briarbloom Coat - 29/33/35<br />
Briarbloom Bulwark - 95/108/116<br />
 <br />
At all rank 1 this totals to 124 without any worn DS or clickys<br />
with some Skinspike potions you can raise it 80 and another 45 from Hungry Vines to total 249 without any raid clickies.<br />
 <br />
Clickies for End-Game raiders:<br />
Slot 2:<br />
Illusionary Spikes(30) - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=46852<br />

 <br />
 <br />
You can now get to 338. 45-Hungry Vines, 116-Virdifloral Bulwark, 35-Virdithorn Coat, 35-Worn DS, 27-Storm Guard(Yar'Lir ring), 80-Distillate of Skinspikes XIII (Save any Aderirse Burrs you get, because it is the only dropped component for this potion)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Now for the powerleveling locations. I tend to choose dungeons because of amount of mobs, the majority of them being KoS and the amount of right corners in the geography. Here is the normal path that I follow when powerleveling someone.<br />
 <br />
Paludal Caverns 10-20<br />
Mistmoore 20-30<br />
Lower Guk 30-40<br />
Karnors Castle 40-50<br />
Nadox 50-65<br />
 <br />
EDIT: Good Locations with current Hot Zones<br />
 <br />
PoInnovation 50-60<br />
CoDecay 55-65<br />
 <br />
 <br />
1. Paludal Caverns - http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/paludalcavernsmap.html<br />
 <br />
When powerleveling here stick to the Hollowshade Moor side and pull the phlerg fiends they will go down quick to a high level druids DS, just make sure to get the PBAE to stick on all the mobs before they die. Paludal is one of the zones I don't have much experience powerleveling in because most of the people I PL are already past this level.<br />
 <br />
2. Castle Mistmoore -<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/mistmooremap.html<br />
 <br />
When powerleveling in Mistmoore, where you stay is dependent on the toons level. If you just got here at level 20 stay at the entrance and pull the first area all the way to the graveyard and back and let the powerleveled toon level up to 25ish before moving. At about 25 you should be able to start getting your spells to land on the mobs inside the castle, so you can move there. I suggest keeping the powerleveled toon in the entrance of the castle, just north of #8 on the map. You can stay here until level 35 if you wish but I like LGuk so much i just move there at first chance.<br />
 <br />
3. Lower Guk -<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/lgukdeadmap.html<br />
 <br />
Lower Guk is the one zone in Everquest that I know like the back of my hand, somewhat due to hunting there back when FBSS sold well, somewhat due to the 10s of toons I've powerleveled in the zone and 100s of levels they've gained. When starting here at level 30 I suggest pulling the zone in 3 different waves. I camp in the safe hall, a tiny bit below #10 on the map. If you are already in the safe hall when started you can combine 2 waves. I always zone in from point C on the map and have the powerleveled toon wait until I get all the mobs clear, then I move south east until i hit water then i follow it south and pick up room #6, by now you should have 8 mobs. Next you move into the bat room, south of #6 and pick up 5 more mobs. Head southeast again and pick up the 5 skeletons, # 10. Now head South west to grab 2 more frogloks and you should be looking at a walkway on your right 3 or 4 gargoyles, on your left 3 ghoul wizards... grab both groups of them. By now you should have about 25-30 mobs on you, go south again on the walkway into another room with 1 static spawn and a roamer, get into the Southwest corner and let the powerleveled toon catch up and PBAE them. Now have the powerleveled toon wait on the walkway or in the room you just pulled the mobs to while you get another train. Go east from the previous room and up a later to get 3 or 4 mobs from the Ghoul Assassin's room, # 14 then backtrack and head south down the stairs. Continue down and through level 2 grabbing all the mobs as you go until you get to room #15 aggro them, then head down to level 3. When you get level 3 turn right and head into room #17, in that room there are 4 mobs, 2 behind an invisible wall on the south side, grab them all. Backtrack again but this time head to room #18, the Ghoul Executioner and grab the 5 or 6 mobs in there, now head west to room # 16 and grab those 3 mobs. Leave room #16 and head towards D on the map, there should be a room of 3 mobs on your way there, grab them. At point D, turn left and grab the mob or 2 in there then go across to the other side and grab those 3 mobs then pull them all into the safe hall, in the northwest corner, just below and to the left of #10. Now tell your powerleveled toon to drop down or levitate down from the walkway into the safehall to PBAE these mobs. Now have the powerleveled toon stay in the safe hall while you head to get the final wave of mobs in Lower Guk dead side. Head east then head north out of the safe hall, as you go you will pick up about 6 static mobs and 2 or 3 roamers before you hit the open room with the fake tile that you fall through. hug the east wall and take a right then you will turn left through a fake wall and grab a static mob and keep going and turn right through another fake wall and grab 2 static mobs room # 5, now backtrack back to the open room. go to the west wall now and go into room #4. There will be pieces of the ground slanted up just look up and run up them and you will enter the suspended water, keep swimming to the top till you get to a ledge with the reanimated hand and a froglok, grab them and backtrack again. When you are back in the open room head north and grab 10 mobs then enter the ghoul lords room and grab those 3 mobs, room #3. Backtrack all the way to the room outside the safe hall with the prisons for the live frogloks. When in that room head east and follow that path and grab the roamer and static mob. You should now be turned to the east and be able to go left, right, or straight ahead which is incomplete ground that you cant run across, turn left here. You will go to a room with 2 static mobs, grab them then head to the north east corner of that room and walk through the fake wall go through it and keep going till you can turn left again. Turn left again and keep going and you will end up in a bigger room with about 4 mobs in it, grab them all then head northeast toward the frenzied ghoul room, room #7 grab the 3 mobs in there. Now backtrack to the bigger room you just left but this time head south then east down some stairs. at the base of the stairs turn left through a fake wall and grab a static spawn then head east again through another fake wall then turn right and grab 3 static mobs, now backtrack up the stairs and turn left then follow that till you reach the portion of the ground that is incomplete. Turn left now and go through another fake wall which is in the southwest corner and grab the 2 static mobs there now head back to the Safe hall and let your powerleveled toon PBAE them (at level 30 these mobs will resist alot but by level 35ish the resists should disappear except for named mobs). By now there should only be about 5 or 6 undead frogloks on your track, you can go pick those mobs up to skillup the powerleveled toon if his skills are falling behind now.<br />
 <br />
4. Karnor's Castle -<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/karnors1map.html<br />
 <br />
Karnor's is a much more straight forward zone to get around in, other than the underground dungeon which I always get lost in. When you enter the zone head north and grab the 2 static guards then the 4 static guards in the main room of the first building. In the southeast corner there is a opening that leads to the top of the building, head up it. Go around the top of the castle and grab all the static and roaming guards, about 10 or 12 total to give you around 16 or 18 mobs by now, head back to the first floor and head north again. You will get 2 more static mobs then be able to turn left or right into the 2 courtyards, go into each and grab all the mobs then head back to the entrance and let the powerleveled toon PBAE them. If that was too easy the first time then go to the courtyard on the left and go up the stairs, go around the castle wall and pick up all the mobs about 5 or 6 total then head back toward the northwestern #7 on the map then head north again. Eventually you will be forced to turn right then immediately you should turn left into the hand room #10 and grab those 4 mobs, head out of there and turn left then left again then right. By now you should be looking down a mini hallway that has 5 doors 3 on the right 2 on the left, each door containing 1 mob. Open each and grab them all. At the end of the hallway on the left there are stairs, go down them and open the door. In this next room # 8 on the map, there are 4 static mobs either bodyguards, warlords, or pawdusters. The warlords summon, so be careful when aggroing them... just dont get them below 97% otherwise it can be a hassle to get them all back to the entrance. A word of caution when pulling back to the entrance on the last stretch on the map going horizontal -200 to +100 the mobs dont follow correctly and run backward then forward at you so when pulling across that go slow, otherwise mobs will forget you and head back to their place in the zone. After getting that part of the zone killed you can move into the dungeon which is in the northeast corner of water on the map, turn left then go underwater and you will find a tunnel that eventually ends and you can go on land again. In here is probably some of the better exp just because of the amount of mobs here that are so clumped together, however I never created a standard path to follow when pulling them, so just experiment eventually you will get out the way you came in with tons of mobs on you : ). Here is a map to help, http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/karnors2map.html<br />
 <br />
5. Sebilis -<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/sebilis1map.html<br />
 <br />
I really can't talk about this zone much other than the keying process and the theory that the mobs are level 50s and hit for just a bit more than Karnor mobs. To get keyed for Sebilis you have to kill 2 mobs in Trakanon's Teeth and turn them into Emperor Ganak in the southwest corner of the zone. The two mobs you must kill are a froglok hunter, and a froglok forager, sans &quot;a&quot; when tracking them. They run fast but have about 6k hp so just nuke them twice or three times and let the powerleveled toon loot them and turn them in.<br />
 <br />
EDIT: I did test out Sebilis, I did it for a level 40 cleric, but it will get level 50s+ exp. What I did was I ran straight from the entrance down the hallway grabbing the 6 mobs, then getting the 2 at the base of the stairs turning right grabbing those 3 mobs. Then I rounded that little building that is on your left and went inside it grabbing all mobs as I go. I backtrack to the entrance of the builds (only like 2 steps) and headed east across the bridge then you should follow that long corridor grabbing all about 15 mobs on your way, then slowly head back to the entrance with the mobs, the pathing/amount of casters usually makes some mobs lag behind and lose interest and just deaggro. When you get back to the entrance I suggest getting into one of the northern corners to decrease interupts and then just do what druids do best! Also because of the high amount of casting mobs they tend to gate alot... so PBAE stunning is helpful. This has yet to happen to me but it is a possibility... If you happen to aggro a namer that is also a caster and he happens to gate you will most likely be summoned to his bind spot(if it's close enough) and not back because on the first floor no trash summon, unlike the lower floor where they almost all do. On a side note this is a great place to farm the new DoN tradeskill materials for trivs (196-216)ish and about a 10% chance of getting the (230-250)ish drops.<br />
 <br />
I hope this helps people who are trying to help out a new friend, a new bot, or mabye a random person one day when you are feeling nice. If there is anything I missed or said that was incorrect please tell me, so I may correct it. I also appologize if the directions for pulling in LGuk and Karnors are confusing, following the map is probably easier for most people.</div></div><hr />

I clear the beach until they are about 35ish, then go up to the fort/pirate area and clear that bit.<br />
 <br />
Another thing I do when PLing my own alts and they are a non PBAE class, I ask a friend if they wanna make an alt too with a pbae and and I PL theirs and mine together. Its a bit less xp than solo, but I can concentrate on keeping myself alive when I pull so many (I have managed kill myself a couple times &gt;.&lt;) and the friend can worry about getting a hit on them all.</div></div><hr />

For example if you are kiting 10 orcs, your target + 3 adjacent orcs will be hit by the spell 6 will remain unharmed.

Most PBAE's have a very small casting range usually you have to be close enough to melee if you want the spell to hit.<br />

I rarely play now so I'm kinda out of the loop in the happening in EQ.  Anyways thanks!  And to address the nerfing of SoReptile, yes it no longer works, mainly because it scales the % of proccing to the level of the mob hitting you 5% per level below you from a base of 10% chance.  So if you are level 80 it will only proc on level 61-80+ mobs anything below that don't bother memming it.  So this is utterly worthless now unless you can find level 61+ mobs that hit for low amounts.</div></div><hr />

From what I've heard our two burst heals, Adrenaline Surge and Adrenaline Swell run on different timers.  I believe that in every single zone that i listed for AOE PLing these should be sufficent to keep any druid up.  Plus with the new gear comming out of SoF, even non raiding druids should be able to hold up against a swarm of mobs in Sebilis.</div></div><hr />

Chain heals and Hungry Vines to build agro.  After 4-5 Casts of either you can aoe once and not get agro.  Use regular heals untill you get stunned/interupted down to 25%, use SotF and hope you dont need to use it again for 90 secs, go back to regular heals and the Adrenaline heals if you need to till its back up.  If SotF crits on you at 25% it will be a near insta cast CH.  CoS got upped to near 4k insta heal with a 2k heal over time component.  Thats ona 15 min timer but with pulls like the ones i posted you only need to use it once a pull and they take a good 10 mins just to pull if you dont have someone pullin for ya.<br />
<br />
With a SK buddy (whom i suggest all druids get) just have them put shrink wand or something similar in primary and chain their aoe hate spells obviously.  Ive even done it with a chanter pulling and useing rune to stop the meele dmg but allow the DS dmg.  I did get agro but it split the mobs between the 2 of us allowing the pull size to increase.<br />
<br />
This is definately still doable, i got my warrior at 51 tons of AA's, then got him to 55 and got him more AA's.  In 3 days he'd accumulated 110AA thanks to Dranik Scar, and hes Kindly for faction now rofl.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lotharun</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great resource.  Pretty much what I do.  For mobs over level 25 this method works great.  I strongly suggest PLing on undead since they don&#8217;t run.  Just be careful with undead.  I also suggest finding the highest mob density you can in the quietest place you can.  Nothing sucks worse than cleaning out a zone area and having to wait on repop.  Its very easy to clear Karnors from the front to VS before repop using a high level Druid.<br />
<br />
To a large degree undead do not respect threat.  They are happy to hit the nearest target, or the lowest level target if the PLer and PLee are side by side.  You can use this to your advantage at low levels, say level 25-ish and below.  Go to the undead portion of the Drakon starter area in Crescent Reach.  Park your Druid in the middle of them on the hill by the cave in the back.  Undead passing by will stick to your Druid like a black hole swallowing stars.  Thorn up the Druid!  All you need to do is use your lowest level nuke of your PLee, assuming it&#8217;s a caster.  Then cast once on nearby undead and train them onto your Druid.  With this method you never need to touch the Druid except to heal if your PLee gets rooted by the one of the undead shaman &#8211; which can but doesn&#8217;t happen too often.  Beyond a skin, SoW and maybe a regen, I don&#8217;t even bother to buff the PLee.  Definitely DO NOT thorn your PLee.  They don&#8217;t need the extra agro it generates.  If you&#8217;re using a melee, they can easily hit the mob once then circle around your Druid like you used to do when you quad kited to pin the mob onto the Druid.<br />
<br />
On higher level stuff, if your PLee doesn&#8217;t have an pbAE, like say a Shaman or a Ranger, you can use the 3 or 4 target AEs.  Use it once, then cycle through 4 targets and use it again &#8211; repeat.  I&#8217;ve bound my tab key to next target.  Even without some sort of AE, it&#8217;s not too difficult to cycle through 15 or 20 targets to hit them once.  Just make sure your PLer has great agro before starting, and I can&#8217;t say this enough &#8211; if it&#8217;s a pack of undead, be extra careful!<br />
<br />
If you do pick an area with runners, try and pick an area with mostly one mob type and avoid mobs that gate if you can.  Don&#8217;t snare mobs that gate.  If you&#8217;re PLing against level 50+ mobs, they&#8217;re going to summon you.  Think Sebilis.  It&#8217;s annoying and dangerous.  You can get lost with ease in some dungeons!  I suggest when PLing against mobs that summon, that you wait until you get back to your PL spot before applying your Damage Shield.  Trust me, it&#8217;s a much safer way to PL, especially when you&#8217;re pulling 20+ level 50 mobs.  When you&#8217;re getting down to the last few mobs, pick the one with the highest hps and snare it.  Once it&#8217;s the last mob, root it and sit down repeatedly so it doesn&#8217;t miss you and dies extra fast.  I also use the sit technique on small pulls, when I&#8217;m not having to heal too much to speed things along.  Works best right after I apply Hungry Vines.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you&#8217;re in a hurry &#8211; DON&#8221;T LOOT!  I know it&#8217;s a hard reflex to avoid, but you&#8217;ll be spending close to 50% of your time looting and destroying crap if you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 1-10 Blackburrow /  Any other 1-10 Dungeon:<br />
<br />
Dropped all DSes on my druid, aggroed each mob by casting Skin to Flora, and trained them to a place where my magician could AE them with Flame Flux.  After my magician ran OoM from casting the PBAE spell, i put up some damageshields and chain sat down on my druid to kill them quickly.  This dinged my magician to level 10.<br />
<br />
Repeated through level 65.  So you can start at any level!</div></div><hr />
