<br />
Omen use: whoever is on top, is going to need heals ;)<br />
<br />
Cats Swiftness to boots is ok, and you will gain the speed in tree, it's a 25% snare.<br />
<br />
BG rewards has some pretty good gear actually.  The boots are pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
Pie &gt; cake.   The cake is a lie.</div></div><hr />

You will discover that level 70 PvP is a whole different ballgame (two level 70's toe to toe with different sets of gear? - good stuff.)  And if you start now, you will probably have accumulated a decent amount of honor points and marks to start getting some of that nice gear.  <br />
<br />
Mind you, if PvP is not your cup of tea, then you don't HAVE to do it.  I've found that it IS possible to get bored during the game and a good bout of PvP can cure that.  Not to mention how cool it feels the first time you take down 2 opponents at once.  (self-healing WILL be involved - hee hee)<br />
<br />
Run 5 mans whenever you can.    Rep is important.  And there are a gazillion keys out there to get.  You will want those later.<br />
<br />
Finally, Cherry Cheesecake is my favourite treat in the world.  Thanks for mentionning it, now I must find some.</div></div><hr />
