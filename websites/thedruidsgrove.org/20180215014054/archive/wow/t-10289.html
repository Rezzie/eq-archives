<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-20-2006, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone. <br />
<br />
On Friday late at night I heard some warrior spamming WTS Warden Staff.  I asked him how much, and he said 150g.  I bought it immediatley, and have been putting it up on the AH with a 250g bid, 260g buyout, and so far, no one has bought it. <br />
<br />
I'm really debating whether I try to make 100g profit off of it (I have 450 gold right now - selling it would put me 100g away from my Epic Mount), or keep it for my tanking gear (Just got the Mark of Tyrrany, and am going to start the quest to get Ring of Protedtion after I get Ony attuned.)  My plan all along was to get the Unyielding Maul from DM Tribute rather than buy the Warden Staff, though I have now been on 5 Trib runs without success.  <br />
<br />
I have been more and more wanting my epic mount (lv 60 BG's suck without it lol), but also have been making a big push to get my bear AC up (only at about 6500 right now - Warden / Unyielding would put me to about 7300).  Anyone have any suggestions?  What would you do?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayze</div><div class="date">03-20-2006, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah i'd keep it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sond</div><div class="date">03-21-2006, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you already have it, keep it. The warden staff is marginally better for bear form. +10 base armor (+46/50 bear) , +2 defense, -1 stam vs. the maul. The unyielding maul has higher dps, but that only matters in caster/moonkin form. The only reason you're going to be swinging anything in Moonkin is to proc OoC. Ideally would be using a +dmg or +crit weapon. Your real dps will come from casting. Caster form melee is loldps for raising weapon skills.<br />
<br />
The warden staff is end game bear gear. There is no reason to get rid of it until something clearly better gets added to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-21-2006, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice guys.  I equipped it last night, and picked up my Mark of Tyrrany at the same time (have had that quest completed forever, just having a real hard time deciding between mark and blackhand's).<br />
<br />
I now am just under 8k armor in bear form!  Oh, and I'm resto speccd atm, but planning on goin back to feral in a few months.  I have all the mats for my cloak of warding as well, just looking for a tailor to make it.  <br />
<br />
Now to get my Dancing Sliver and a Trindlehaven staff.</div></div><hr />

I bought mine for 199gp at level 44, and it has been worth every coin.<br />

Bears get 1196 armor from the Warden Staff.<br />
<br />
At level 52, I have 6.3 k armor MoTW-buffed in bear form. The staff simply rocks for tanking.</div></div><hr />

My decision to equip it was about 4.5 months ago or something.  I got a +15str enchant on it shortly after (25 agi wasnt available :( ).  I really want 25agi on it now, but cant stand to 'waste' the str that is already on it.  <br />

Every druid needs warden staff as soon as they can get it.</div></div><hr />

Malfurion's is bind-on-pickup:<br />

Not every druid will be able to get into a raid where they can roll (or spend DKP) to get it.</div></div><hr />

I know that silly. I was just telling him what next &quot;must have&quot;-druid item he should get. I never said you could buy it at a vendor. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The unyielding maul is so much easier to get and not that much diffrent that I wouldnt pay more then 100g to get it but on my server its expensive .. 300-400g atleast, Id rather gear up my guildies then grind and auction BoEs  to get that amount of gold.<br />

I can't describe how gutted I am.  We're a tiny guild of real-life friends and we currently don't have anyone else who can tank, so I didn't expect anyone else to roll need.  I asked him why he needed it and he said it did more damage than his current staff, plus the extra armour would be handy!!!  :(</div></div><hr />

Hope he gets a bucket of paint on his head tbh. I know it's just a game.. but a mage stealing Warden from a druid claiming they need the armor and melee-damage is just completely retarded imo. :( Hope he buys you a new one from AH.</div></div><hr />

Lol!  I have done (shown him the thread that is, not poured paint on his head...  yet).  :)<br />

You're right, it is just a game.  There's no bad feelings and I'm sure he's happy with it which is the main thing.  But I can't help wondering what might have been!  :ohwell:</div></div><hr />

You can always buy it from AH later in your druid career.<br />

&lt;3 your attitude tbh. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">07-25-2006, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.  Love people who have a good attitude about this game.  Soo many people that I run into get all pissy and bent about loot.  Some have left groups mid instance, some have even gone so far as to gquit.  <br />
<br />
Keep it up with the positive vibes.  :)<br />
<br />
I'd say next must have item for a druid Lumbergh is the Bonecrusher, easily attained from a Dire Maul quest line.  Its a 2h mace with +30str and +1% crit.  I use it for my dps gear, while I keep my warden staff for my tanking gear (and if I am in dps gear and have to bear-up, I just swap weapons mid combat for the extra 1100 armor).<br />
<br />
There are lots of really good items for pre-raid druids.  I have a tank set and a dps set that I have gotten from DM, Scholo, Strat, LBRS and UBRS.  All my healing gear is Molten Core, though pre MC it came from Dire Maul.  If you want I can send you a list of stuff /shrug</div></div><hr />

At least Doomulus Prime with +15 STR and the Cloak of Warding I had made  (both this past weekend) will hold me over until I can find another deal on the staff (gloat).</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've used Unyielding Maul for ages with a +25 agi but bought a warden staff just b4 xmas for 80g :)  still not equipped it as was tempted to sell it on.....and i need to buy the enchant again for not much diff in stats....<br />
<br />
yeah the MBB is the next big upgrade i feel for a druid. could not believe it when i got mine a while ago.<br />
<br />
hit 15.3k armour now with motw.<br />
<br />
Boots of the Shadow Flame are also a very nice piece if you're doing BWL regularly. Never got mine as they only dropped 2 times and the time i was there the ML made an error and gave them to the wrong person. Oh and the Elementiaum Threaded Cloak from BWL is nice as well if u get a chance on it....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol...  The mage in question was actually the guild master, but I have to say that had nothing to do with his decision to roll need.  In fairness, if I'd realised how excellent it would have been for bear tanking, he'd have rolled greed or handed it over after he'd won it.<br />
<br />
In fact, he felt a bit guilty afterwards and about a week later I went to the mail box and found a gift-wrapped Warden Staff with a +25 agility enchant waiting for me.  Even though I've replaced it since the expansion, I still keep it in my bank and refuse to sell it.  :)</div></div><hr />
