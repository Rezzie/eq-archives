We usually have dozens of code changes going on at any time, so when we want to put something live, it has to be manually added to the live code. In this case, we had a lot of things we didn't want to include because they aren't ready to go out yet and mistakingly missed adding the code part of the spell proc fix to the patch. It's been working on test for a while now...it just didn't get added to the patch to go live. So, I apologize. We know its a big issue for a lot of folks so we're going to patch tonight specifically to add this fix to the live servers.<br />
<br />
Regarding the interaction of AH/GoM, while the actual in-game impact of having AH check before GoM is minor, I can understand the psychological implications and am willing to lower AH by a percent across the board to ensure that GoM always checks before AH does. That change won't go out until our next large patch, though.<br />

I'll give them a week to answer before I start complaining.<br />

This is why Rashere said he would drop AH5 to 9% from 10% so that way we would get more GoM procs.  However, we have never heard if he has actually done this.  Quite a few people are awaiting his word before buying AH5.<br />
<br />
There is a thread on The Druids Grove anxiously awaiting some official word.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
That change was done in the patch right after I mentioned I was going to change it, so has been that way for a while now.<br />

 <br />
From what I have searched I see that an AH proc is a 250/tick for 30 seconds..<br />
 <br />
Is that the max with AH5? Does Extended Duration Foci effect this? Does it stack with additional HoT type spells? <br />
 <br />
Thanks for the info.<br />

<br />
Yes that is at max level.<br />
<br />
I don't know off hand.<br />
<br />
Yes it stacks because it goes to the song window.</div></div><hr />
