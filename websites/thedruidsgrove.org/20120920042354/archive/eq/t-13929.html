I think I've seen this discussed, but I'm unable to find it.</div></div><hr />

MA focuses all my DoTs but one, but is a higher percentage focus, so it's worth it.<br />
<br />
And as Turik said, they are two completely separate things (DoT damage foci and DoT AA's), so there is no either-or argument.  You want both.  Similar to DDs, one adds a percentage to your base damage, and the other gives you a chance to double your base damage (crits).<br />
<br />
You also want to add a DoT mana-saving focus.  With all three, you will be amazed at the difference.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get Affliction Efficiency 5 for a non-raider.  The only way I know of is with a customized &quot;flow&quot; (OoW) aug (&quot;of pure potency&quot;), but I can't afford that.  So I do AE5 focus through tribute.  It's 216 tribute points per hour, but I can generally reload my tribute points for a 10-1 ratio with bazaar junk, so it only costs me about 20pp/hour, and I only have to reload it about once a month.<br />
<br />
There is a fourth DoT helper, a focus to extend the duration of your DoTs.  I have yet to find a way to obtain any of those.  There is an aug in a LDoN camp, but that's not realistic for me, since nobody does LDoNs any more.<br />

I've looked into this before as well, and aside from a Discordant/Bazu/Last Blood aug, the only sources of items with this focus usable by a druid are :<br />
<br />
- Facade of Fright from MPG Trial of Fear<br />
- Dragorn Runemark from Hulcror outside MPG<br />
- Belt of the Stagnant from Warden Hanvar in Anguish<br />
<br />
There might be more from PoR / Demiplane, but since I don't have access to those on my druid, I don't worry about those zones.<br />
<br />
As for DoT damage, yes, a Magic Focus like Muram's Anger or better is better than a BA5 aug.  Plus, if you can get a Fire focus from DoN / OoW / GoD like Pyrlien ______, you'll have both set of DoT's covered.  The leather-rot gloves from one of the Zun's or the leather bracer from Xxeric in Tacvi are great for this, as is the BP from Kessadona - all three are a 40%+ Fire focus iirc. (I might be forgetting some sources of this focus but ...)<br />

<br />
BTW, what's better, Afflicition Efficiency of some sort or a Detrimental mana reduction focus?  I haven't crunched the numbers on either to see what saves more mana.</div></div><hr />
