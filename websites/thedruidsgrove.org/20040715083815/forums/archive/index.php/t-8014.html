<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glynna1</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok another question on spell drops for GoD and mainly for those that have gotten past Uqua since I'm curious. I don't see an increase in spell drops and from what I think a lot of people perceived was that there would be a higher increase in drops. I'm not talking about the quest turn in one either. <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen an increase of drops past Uqua?<br />
<br />
I'm posting this here because I feel it has to do more with the expansion than discussing spell detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilien Venator</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still pissed at how rare our heal spell is... We refer to it as a myth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arienne</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleric heal spell used to be rare, too.  Then by popular cleric rant, rave and demand, their heal spell became the rune turn in rather than a specific spell drop.<br />
<br />
Anyone up for a whine fest?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daggeniel</div><div class="date">05-28-2004, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ancient spells used to drop like candy in Qvic - they were farmable with respawn time in minutes... so, quite correctly they got removed from those mobs. They do, however, now drop other GoD spells so you could feasibly farm those to get the spells you need (they need 20ish to kill efficiently). We killed 3 the other day and got one spell drop (ranger 65spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">05-29-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh.  The cleric heal spell which results from the stone turn in is Holy Elixir (100hp/sec).  The one we want (Holy Light, over 800hp/sec) is the rare one.  And the reason we complained is that Holy Elixir wasn't dropping at all - while Order was both dropping and resulting from the stone handin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">06-07-2004, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the cyno guards dropped sylvan embers the other day, think that'll be the only dru spell they drop.  Don't think I've seen both pre kod spells drop for any other classes since they changed it from ancient runes to old spells.<br />
 <br />
and think we already have the rune turn in thing too.  <br />

 <br />
the 3rd stone is just the old Kod geostone, the other ones are for all classes minus melees so those should be for the pre kod spells (melees didn't get discs at that lvl).   Just have to figure out which makes Infusion and which makes Embers (and where they both drop!)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baggwinn</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my Sylvan Infusion from the Sewers, Sylvan Embers from Vxed and my Sylvan Fire from a named in Kod'Taz (Hynid Howler or some such) Dropped DS Range Item, Geomancy Stone Jekli and another Geo Stone for the other spells can't recall which. Many folks have had 3 or 4 Geo Stones drop from nameds in KT and considering it's not too difficult to get there, they are reasonably common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendul3164</div><div class="date">06-08-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow Baggwinn, Im not sure if its a server thing, but we RARELY see spell drops on KT Named mobs - let alone 3 or 4! Perhaps they ninja changed something in the last 3 days (last time I saw a namer in KT) in which case after raids ill be heading back there tonight. Ive been trying to farm these for not only myself, but for the guild as well. Enchanters new ae mez is a lifesaver. <br />
<br />
Grats on all three spells =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendul3164</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small Update:<br />
<br />
Got Jelki from the Hynib Howler in KT. Received Sylvan Fire. <br />
<br />
The Cragbeats Rager dropped 2 (two) Eril's in the same zone the day before. So apparantly the spell stones are not limited to a set stone. At least not as much as I assumed before.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, the Infusion stone still only drops in the expeditions/trials.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

I saw a Yiktu drop from a Kod'Taz named about a week ago. Pixxt or Hexxt something or other, near the zone line to Natimbi. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spell drops in GoD suck hard, but considering their current stance of spells=gear, hardly surprising.<br />
<br />
Course that's one less reason to bother with OOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glynna1</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent 3 hours last night killing in sewers, no named ever popped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendul3164</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they dont pop after 30minutes, none are going to. Its better to just back out - wait a few minutes, and get a new sewer expedition. They arent guaranteed sadly =(<br />
<br />
In addition, Im not sure if they made the trigger being getting to a certain place in the zone - I thought I remember hearing about progressing through will spawn them...Ill definently chat with the guildies farming these in their downtime for hints.<br />
<br />
On a side note - I havent tried soloing the sewers yet. I spend most of my GoD soloing time in Vxed/Tipt. Hows the difficulty compare Glynna?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phread</div><div class="date">07-14-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glynna,<br />
spell drops and named in general in the sewers has gotten just plain BAD.<br />
<br />
i see a named in one in maybe 5 or 6 sewers now and have seen runes drop off of about 1 in 7 named.  and they are all the entry level rune.  none of the second level runes yet, although i'm assured they do drop there sometimes.<br />
<br />
i cycle between spawning the first set of mobs and checking for named or clearing the first round of phs and waiting for named on second round.  so far, equal luck doing each, so your choice about how long you want to give each instance to cough up a named for you.  on the bright side, these zones, much like tipt seems to, can detect the classes in your group to ensure the loot dropped is not usable by anyone in the zone.  so THAT's fun.</div></div><hr />
