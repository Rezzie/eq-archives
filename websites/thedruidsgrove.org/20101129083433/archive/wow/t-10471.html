<br />
I was thinking and don't you think that a 5 druids group would be able to do the 45 min baron run?<br />
<br />
Our aoe deals 1340 dmg with a 1 min cooldown, leave 1 resto druid as the healer, the others barskin and hurricane, after hurricane ends if theres any mobs left go bear/cat and finish them off.<br />
<br />
Healer druid will drink btwfights while the others pull, and the aoers will drink every three fights. Im considering a 5k self buffed mana pool.<br />
<br />
The 1 min cooldown wont be a problem. The healer could go, pull, aoers drinking a little, healer go bear, aoers stand up, barskin and hurricane again. In this time the cooldown should be over.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
Possible, impossible?<br />
<br />
Maybe with some changes here and there, two healers, not sure, i was just wondering hehe :wiggle: <br />
<br />
EDIT: It just came to me that Hurricane is balance, have the 4 aoe druids spend some gold and respec to moonkin!!!!!!<br />

<br />
If you've never played moonkin, it makes the barkskin+hurricane combo much more viable though, since you will get aggro its nice to be wearing plate (8000AC), and the barkskin helps with the mitigation as well as preventing interrupts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like you are making life harder on yourself this way.  I think it would be easier with a Holy priest, resto druid, prot warrior and 2 mages.  Lots of AoE and healing and hopefully real good aggro control.  Priest and druid could rotate healing and druid could go feral when off healing duty to keep the dps up.<br />
<br />
The only way it would make sense is if you could stealth all 5 of you through some parts and avoid combat, but from what I hear a lot of the undead have huge detect stealth radii.</div></div><hr />

I will give it a try on my server and let you guys know!!<br />

The first problem with an all druid  group in Strat is no one can cure disease... I forget what those debuffs are off the top of my head, but I know they're there... some with 30min timers.  The second problem I see is the long coold down on our AoE.  I think the Barron is when it'll be the big issue... you can make up some of it with Holywater... but I'm fairly certain the skelton waves will over-whelm you.<br />
<br />
I think it's possible for full Tier1-2 druids to do this, but they prob wouldn't be that intrested in the .5 armor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Impossible. Ive done it and I know that druids dont have the tools to get it done.<br />
<br />
1. Hurricane sucks. I dont care what you say it compares nothing to Mages AOE. A mage could down those groups within 5 seconds; our hurricane would take them to maybe 75% in 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
2. Druid heals are long. We dont have the fast heals to keep up the group taking on 5-6 mobs at a time, and even if you did do it using regrowth, you still would create too much downtime with all the drinking after every big pull.<br />
<br />
3. Druids can tank. We do moderate DPS while tanking. A Fury warrior can take pretty much the same damage and just wtfpwn things. Im not saying Feral druids as tank is impossible. I tanked for the group when we did it. Im saying the more druids you have in the group, the more DPS your gonna need, even from the tank.<br />
<br />
4. Druids in cat form will get 4 shotted by the mobs putting too much strain on your healer if they draw aggro.<br />
<br />
5. No CC. Priests can shackle mobs, mages can frostnova. Druids have no choice but to switch to bear and tank their damage.<br />
<br />
So, no, an all druid run is not possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hurricane is one of the best AoEs, if not the best; not only does damage but reduces attack speed, maybe the DPS is not as efective as the mage. but i don't think that's a problem if 3 druids are doing hurricane<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Druid heals are long. We dont have the fast heals to keep up the group taking on 5-6 mobs at a time, and even if you did do it using regrowth, you still would create too much downtime with all the drinking after every big pull.<br />
fast heals? if you have a &quot;decent&quot; +healing, your rejuvenation will be more than enough to let you keep healing. with those &quot;long heals&quot; that you talk about<br />
<br />
<br />

Feral Druids with decent gear, can<br />

Not really, a Druid that can play their class knows how to manage their aggro.<br />
<br />
5. No CC. Priests can shackle mobs, mages can frostnova. Druids have no choice but to switch to bear and tank their damage.<br />
True, but don't think that makes impossible the run.<br />
<br />
So, no, an all druid run is not possible. <br />
i only agree with that statment if people is not experienced enough/ don't know how to play their classes. a group with <br />
1 Feral Druid (bear) (+def gear),  2 Feral Druids (cat) (+str/+agi/+crit), 1 Balance Druid (helping patch heal), 1 Resto Druid</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Hurricane sucks. Im just going to stick with that. You go ahead and learn the hard way by trying that in your 5 druid UD Strat run. Also, what happens when after every other abomination drops 4 adds that you have to aoe down? Oh yeah, then the 100 skeletons that come out after the Abom boss. Oh yea....those 6 skeleton elites that come out right after them. Enjoy dieing as you watch your cooldowns tick.<br />
<br />
2. Rejuv with +550 healing does 350 a tick, every 3 seconds. They hit you for over 500 a second in anything but bear/moonkin. Yea, rejuv will keep a whole party up....lol, yea right<br />
<br />
3. Feral Druids not wearing tanking gear can pretend to do DPS. Fury Warriors who are tanks, do more damage then a rogue.<br />
<br />
4. Managing your aggro on 1 mob isnt a problem. Its when you have 4 mobs in the group, and you get the oh so unforntunate add you will always get in running 45 min baron run that you are going to have to deal with.<br />
<br />
To add another point, with all druids you lose out on every other buff in the game. Stamina, Arcane Intellect, Spirit, etc. No silence either so your going to have to either let them cast on you, move up to where they are to attack them, or run far back to have them chase you.<br />
<br />
Could 5 druids do a UD Strat run? Sure, if they are all good and know what they are doing. They may struggle at certain points but odds are it can be done....<br />
<br />
Can 5 druids do a UD strat run in 45 mins? No. Ill believe it when I see the video. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Now that is a bit extreme, feral druids can do good dps, fury warriors will not out dps a good rogue, lets keep it real now.<br />
<br />
Also while Hurricane leaves much to be desired in PvE as AoE, his point of having 5 of them on rotating cooldowns isn't horrible.  With just my one we were able to wreak some havoc in the rapid respawn room in BRD (Lyceum or something like that).<br />
<br />
Theres an all druid guild on my server, I bet they make it eventually.</div></div><hr />

If not more than a rogue, equivalent to. I, with full damage gear on, MAYBE crit for 900 in bear form on my mauls. Thats not dps...stop kidding yourself.<br />
<br />
As for Hurricane, fighting BRD lvl 52 or whatever level mobs they are that are Non-Elite is a big difference than fighting lvl 60 elite mobs. Your hurricane does what.....maybe 1.5k damage? Ive seen mages that do 1k damage to every mob with their cone of cold in an instant cast.</div></div><hr />
