<br />
I know that there are alot of really awesome druids out there, and Im hoping some of them will help with something.<br />
<br />
Recently I was asked to run a druid raid healing class for my mid-level family guild. Now, I'm a reasonable druid and I have a ton of shortcuts and hotkeys that I have developed over the time that I have been playing..but theres always something out there to learn.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear any suggestions for healing on raids, use of aa's, hotkeys, special tactics that you use for raid healing or even healing in general from all you fantastic druids that I know are here =) What do you do on raids that makes you stand out in the healing department?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assist healing is a great habit to have.  Will save lives.  If you assist and see someone has agro that will die very quickly (aka silkies) its not a bad idea to start that heal before they get hit.</div></div><hr />

If mob doesn't summon or if you know ranger has weaponsheild up I guess you can let them go, but I usualy say heal anyone that can't FD right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spot healing normally involves the use of four buttons:<br />
1. cycle through near NPCs<br />
2. /assist<br />
3. your heal spell macro of choice<br />
4. target nearest NPC<br />
<br />
Press button #1 while watching your &quot;health of target's target&quot; box. When you see someone that needs a heal, press #2 and then #3. Go back to pressing #1 and repeat. When a nearby non-agro NPC becomes targeted, press #4 to re-set the cycle.<br />
<br />
If you do not have the benefit of &quot;health of target's target&quot;, then you must alternate pressing #1 and #2 until you find a target to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First , get to max range so you agro less... Then use an assist hotkey. <br />
<br />
1: /Assist (insert MT here)            ---&gt;  To put you on the same target as MT<br />
2: /Assist                                   ---&gt;  To Target what the MOB is attacking<br />
3: /cast # (insert heal spell here)   ---&gt;  To start casting the heal <br />
4: /g Casting (heal spell) on %t      ---&gt; (or /rs etc as appropriate) to anounce the heal so others don't worry or duplicate.  <br />
<br />
You can tinker with it to get the timing down but it works MOST of the time.  Lag or the MT targeting another player will mess it up but you just have to work around that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tappin</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a druid, you should fully understand rampage, how people get on the list, how they can 'leave' rampage (death/distance only), and know ahead of time who is planned to be on rampage.<br />
<br />
If you're in a long CH cycle, make sure a necro knows that you're likely to be LOM before others.  Make sure if more than 1 druid is in cycle that you're spread out and not back to back with another (lesser) druid CH.<br />
<br />
And as said above, health of target's target + cycle NPC + assist is invaluable, especially on adds fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're in a CH rotation, use Tunare's Renewal instead of Karana's Renewal. The reasoning behind this is although it heals for less hp, it also uses less mana. Usually our /pause is 10 (one second), so the MT doesn't get low enough on hp for Karana's Renewal to be fully effective anyway. Might as well use Tunare's and save yourself the mana so you can be useful longer :)</div></div><hr />

I actually designed a hot key that our clerics use for when they are taking aggro (actually just about eveyone uses it now) that will send a tell to the druid of thier choice and have a heal returned to them..I love my hotkeys =)</div></div><hr />

Have a spell set saved for self rebuffing after ya get a rez &lt;G&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maedie</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I skip the /assist mainassist button and just use the plain /assist for all assist bouncing, replacing that extra button with /target headcleric instead (since then I can check on the headclerics life, as well as bounce assist off of him to the main tank in a fight.  VERY useful if the main tank just died and its the head clerics job to get the first target of the new tank; you can assist off of him easily. In my guild, druids usually stand with the clerics. )  <br />
<br />
That reminds me; if you are standing with the clerics, have cycle PC hotkeyed. Thus, in similar situations where a main tank died, you can cycle through the clerics near you to find the target of the next tank in rotation. (since one of them is probably grouped with the next MA.)  Usually ,the clerics/druids are standing somewhere where they can't see the fight, so assisting is the only way to get the next target. :)<br />
<br />
Cycle PC also works great if you are in a fight with AE Rampage. I use it tons during Warlord Gintolaken in plane of earth B, since Rogues and SK's always end up standing inside rampage range. (it's set too close to melee range.)  I stand behind them out of AE rampage and cycle quickly through them to toss heals.<br />
<br />
Another tip, that will help you for the next few tips:<br />
<br />
to create a hotkey on the fly, you can use the /hotbutton command  (/ho for short)<br />
<br />
typing &quot;/ho EnchanterName /target EnchanterName&quot; in a chat box creates a new targetting hotbutton just for that enchanter, which you can slip into your hotkey bank.   <br />
<br />
Since bards get agro easily on pulls, (or gets hit with AE or AE-rampage since has to stand so close to MT) I tend to have the main tank's group bard targetted with a special hotkey.  /target bardname<br />
<br />
for some raids we do, if the MT bard goes down, the raid is lost. (no cha song, no overhaste, no full resists on MT, etc...)  Their ability to shake agro will increase drastically once they get enough AA to buy &quot;Fading Memories&quot; but until they do, they need a healer to check in on them. :)<br />
<br />
Same thing for enchanters in certain situations, like clearing trash.  Enchanters have runes, but once those runes are broken through, start tossing heals.  (If a chanter hits 95% life due to direct mob agro start casting heals. In EP's and time, I don't even wait that long. :)  )<br />
<br />
Get used to typing /tar chantername a lot.<br />
<br />
Note: you can abbreviate the player name in the target and get them as long as the abbreviation is unique to the zone.<br />
<br />
I.E. /tar rastapopulous can be shortened to /tar rast  and still target him, as long as he is within a distance of 80 from you.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
With beastlords you often have to type the full name.  When trying to figure out who you wanted to target, the process seems to be:<br />
1) Is there an exact match within range?<br />
2) If not, what target in range has the longest name that starts with what you typed?<br />
<br />
The reason this is a problem for beastlords and not most other classes is that beastlord warders are named after their owner.  The warder has &quot;'s warder&quot; added on so its name is automatically longer than its owner's, resulting in me targetting the warder unless I type out the full name.  Wizards need to put away their familiars (but still leaving the buff icon up) for the same reason.<br />
<br />
I've been using /feedback to suggest that partial names with /target should return the shortest name that matches out of the targets within range...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maedie</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah. Same with anyone's name if there if they still have a recent corpse nearby. If someone was just rezzed, you end up targetting their corpse when typing /tar justrezzedname to buff them ... I've feedbacked that, too.<br />
<br />
(and if a chanter has just dopplegangered... or a wizard has a familiar &quot;flappy&quot; up.  same thing happens.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyleza</div><div class="date">09-19-2004, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite healing spell is Nature's Recovery.  It heals for 30 hps a tic for 3 mins.  The instances in which I use it: 1) Right before puller goes to get mobs ... it's wonderful seeing a FD puller's HPs climb back up while they are FD and waiting to split the mobs.  2) On the MT right before engaging the mob ... very little heal aggro (since it is a HoT) and it allows me to &quot;pace&quot; my cheal.  3) On shamans who LOVE the extra regen.<br />
<br />
Also, I use SOTW3 often ... recast time is 15 minutes ... when *anyone* gets low on health, it is a simple and quick hotkey click, that provides a few extra seconds to get off a quick heal.  Sometimes, it negates the need to cast a direct heal on all in the group ... thereby saving a whole lot of mana.<br />
<br />
Make it a habit to know the ac/hp's of your MT.  Ensure that they let you know immediately when a HP buff drops off or gets dispelled (usually they do, sometimes, they just need an extra reminder).<br />
<br />
Health of Target's Target ... I generally will not stay in a group unless the leader has it.  I have 80+ leadership points and strongly recommend that ALL players save up for HTT before ANY other leadership ability.<br />
<br />
/assist healing ... must use (already described above).<br />
<br />
Lastly, keep your healing hotkey messages SHORT (i.e. KR on [ %t ] ) ... people already know that cheal (KR, TR for us druids) takes 10 seconds.  Quick messages that communicate the point are appreciated by the others in the group.  During raids, send your /heal message to the /healing channel (set up by the raid leader).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps~<br />

<br />
<br />
If its a just pulled mob you might wana give it 1 / 1/2 sec before casting.<br />
<br />
and if it is a boss mob, and the MT's HP are'nt moving, heal anyway.  Cuase on his screen they are =p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radlore</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a guide I wrote a year ago or so, it's a little out of date with regards to some of the keys available for targetting and was geared for the way my guild was raiding at the time, but it's pretty sound.<br />
<br />
Druid Healing on Raids<br />
<br />
-	On tougher mobs, spam heal the MA on incoming. You probably wont get asked to do this. Do it anyway. This is where you help the cleric chain get going. On incoming it is too early for you to debuff or do anything else so this is what you should be doing. If you do this regularly you will begin to notice occasions when youre sure you just saved the MAs life, and you did.<br />
<br />
-	If there is any word of  problems in the cleric chain, target MA (often it is quick to do this by targeting a cleric in the chain and hitting your /assist key if you are right by a cleric) and start spamming  you have to bridge those gaps.<br />
<br />
-	Have a /assist key. This is most important when multiple mobs are in camp. Target mobs in turn and use it to see who they are hitting, especially if you see a mob suddenly run over to a group of people.<br />
<br />
-	Watch the channel for who to heal, calls like Mob resisted slow! should cause you to target the offending shammy and start healing because hes about to get some badass agro if he hasnt already. Remember clerics in the chain should only have to heal MA, do not think twice about healing a cleric who needs it.<br />
<br />
-	It is your job to keep people alive so that they can do their jobs properly. If necessary you will die from the agro gained by healing a slowing shaman, a mezzing chanter, or similar. It is not your job to keep people alive so that they can practice overnuking or because they havent switched out their agro weaps.<br />
<br />
-	Be aware of who is out pulling, and be very careful about healing them. Do NOT heal someone who is pulling even if they are near camp without asking them if its safe.<br />
<br />
-	When people call for heals in the raid channel use /target &lt;name&gt; (/tar for speed) to find them and look at their health  do they need a quick heal (close to death) or a big heal? (e.g. a tank on 50% going down gradually).<br />
<br />
-	Announce heals in /say. This will stop other people wasting heals on your target. Be aware of other people healing too and cancel your heal if they announced first (unless you think the target is gonna die obviously). Dont worry about spamming with this - it isnt spam because its very useful.<br />
<br />
-	Be efficient with mana, just because you announced youre gonna heal someone doesnt mean you have to if they receive a heal from someone else and go to 80% health then just cancel it. All that matters is that they live.<br />
<br />
-	If you are healing a rampage tank you need to be careful, because rampage damage can be very irregular. You should watch for the rampage message and start your large heal immediately. Just before the heal lands you review the tanks health and cancel the heal if it is not necessary. Do not wait for the tanks health to go down far before starting a large heal  you are not a cleric with decently mana efficient intermidiate heal spells. If the tank is gonna go down before your heal lands (and the time remaining on the heal is greater than the cast time of your fast heal) switch to your fast heal and spam him back up again (bye bye mana). It pays to keep a rampage tank at full health between rampages, not 80 or 90% but full health  keep him topped up and use replenishment and natures recovery if you have them. Generally the best way to rampage heal is to have one or more people on fast heals and one person on complete heal  you probably wont have to do this on your own.<br />
<br />
-	Use macros for heals, something like this is fine<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/say casting 5k heal on %t<br />
/cast 2<br />
<br />
-	If youre macro nuts consider different keys for different important people<br />
/sit off<br />
/target &lt;MA&gt;<br />
/say quick heal on %t<br />
/cast 2<br />
<br />
NB: In the above macro you might need to add a /pause between the /target and the /cast lines because there's a client server delay on /target.<br />
<br />
-	Spirit of the Wood is a bit different because it has an instant cast time. To avoid conflicting with another druid you should announce first, then wait a second before activating. If 2 druids announce at the same time, the one that announced first will use theirs and the second one will not. - *EDIT* Don't think this works because different players can see text appear in a slightly different order sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure you are properly specialized.<br />
<br />
Get Mana gear. Max Wis.<br />
<br />
Get an enhanced healing item.<br />
<br />
Get a Spell Haste item. (CH's can't be shortened, but regular heals sure can be. Mine, with AoR is 2.4 seconds.)<br />
<br />
Spend AA's on Healing Adept and Advanced Healing Adept and Healing Adept Mastery and get your baseline healup as far as you can. (I can get over 2500 HP's healed with NI!)<br />
<br />
Spend AA's on Spell Casting Subtley. (WHY did sony take out the OOW updates for that ability?!? It's GREAT!)<br />
<br />
Use /assist. (covered in detail already)<br />
<br />
Use the overhead camera view. It's easier to spot approaching mobs/threats without looking thru a sea of toons.<br />
<br />
Make an &quot;I GOT AGGRO!&quot; hotkey. (just don't use it TOO often)<br />
<br />
Check with your MT if they got room for the stacking, 3 minute regen suppliment. (I forget it's name atm)<br />
<br />
Write down the names of the healers in the CH rotation. If someone dies it's handy to know who to skip, who's next, etc.<br />
<br />
Write down the names of the Main tank, 2nd tank etc. Know who is next.<br />
<br />
Turn off particle effects, names, DS, hits, misses, pet damage and use lower grade textures if you have lag. (No spell effects make it easier to see the action, and pick out someone in need of a heal) <br />
<br />
Announce /afk's to the healing channel. Nothing is worse to have a cycle start and have one of the healers afk.<br />
<br />
Try to avoid having an office in the CH rotation. They might get a /tell that they HAVE to respond to, and miss a CH. (hey, it's an occupational hazard)<br />
<br />
Get a bard in your group. ;-)<br />
<br />
Try to get the healers to gather in one spot. Make sure the tanks know where the healers are. (Tanks have the wonderfull ability to stay in range if they think the healers won't 'creep' forward during battles) <br />
<br />
Get Rangers to stand close by and ready to taunt off any aggro. (this is a tuff one, rangers like to get into a position for a 'clear shot')<br />
<br />
On boss mobs with AE's, have someone dedicated to healing the healers. (This might be a druid, but Pallies and shamans are good for this)<br />
<br />
I hope that helps!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolaque</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">use /stand instead of /sit off because it will take you out of a duck <br />
<br />
assist MA hotkey<br />
1.  /assist &quot;main assist name&quot;<br />
<br />
assist SA hotkey<br />
1.  /assist &quot;secondary assist name&quot;<br />
<br />
assist heal hotkey<br />
1. /assist<br />
2. /stand - takes you out of a possible duck<br />
3. /cast 8 (heal) - use the fastest casting biggest heal you have, you are trying to save someone, not preserve mana<br />
4. /cast 8 - for fizzles<br />
<br />
You can patch now and then with chloroblast.  I rarely, rarely use CH's in raids.  99% of my heals are sylvan infusion. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah.  I usually don't use messages to announce I'm healing So-and-So, it's spam I don't like to see and probably won't see in a fight.  Besides, you get used to who is healing whom in a fight, and know what to expect. <br />
