I need some advice from more experienced players about my build - after lots of forum reading i decided to go for the following:<br />
<br />
Feral Combat (30 points)<br />
<br />
    5/5 Ferocity<br />
    3/5 Feral Instinct<br />
    2/2 Brutal Impact<br />
    2/2 Feline Swiftness<br />
    1/1 Feral Charge<br />
    3/3 Sharpened Claws<br />
    3/3 Predatory Strikes<br />
    2/2 Blood Frenzy<br />
    1/2 Primal Fury<br />
    2/2 Savage Fury<br />
    1/1 Faerie Fire (Feral)<br />
    5/5 Heart of the Wild<br />
<br />
Restoration (21 points)<br />
<br />
    5/5 Improved Mark of the Wild<br />
    5/5 Furor<br />
    5/5 Improved Healing Touch<br />
    5/5 Nature's Focus<br />
    1/1 Nature's Swiftness<br />
<br />
I hope I can heal/offtank in instances with this build, and do a lots of solo PvE, considering there is a large world to explore. Occasional PvP (I'm on PvP server) is also an option.<br />
<br />
Suggestions for improvement are welcome!</div></div><hr />

But if you are going to go 21 in restoration it must include Improved Enrage. Personally I would dump Improved Mark of the Wild. If you want to add it later on go for it, but while you are leveling up you get very little bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />

You will find a lot of druids go with this spec who love feral and want to enhance their healing strength.  Feral is also a very efficient PVE spec. I agree with the above about IMotW. And this build is also used often in PVP.  Natures Swiftness is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiller</div><div class="date">05-31-2006, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice, I will go for Improved Enrage, that leaves me 3 points for Improved Rejuvenation. <br />
<br />
While leveling, is it better to climb through the feral tree first, or mixing it with restoration tree? I am now lev 22, everything in feral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">05-31-2006, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30/21 is an effective spec, its very popular.  But in all honesty at level 22 its not something I would worry about yet.  I think a lot of people get sucked into the specs early on and in the end it limits their game.  Thing is, these specs are designed for a level 60.  With that, its things that a level 60 would need.  While leveling you may find yourself with other needs to fill, that are disregarded once you hit certain points in the game.  This is due to many factors but largely gear, support talents with more points available and just the changing gaming environment.  As you level you will be in many areas.  Once you hit that 55ish mark you are going to start spending more time indoors, raiding or 5 manning the early late game instances so your needs will change.  This particular spec, is a reflection of that need.<br />
<br />
I guess that was a really long and drawn out way of saying don't worry.  And there is a difference between an end game spec and a leveling spec.<br />
<br />
Will this spec work as leveling?  Yes and it would do pretty well.  But its not going to see fruition til you hit 60.  There are more effective methods of leveling.<br />
<br />
And with that don't get sucked into this templat.  What skills and spells are you using?  Really what helps you?  Not the things you use because you are speccing into that, what do you really find the most helpful?  So..when you are leveling why not spec them to enhance the things you find useful.  I only say this because you are asking about things before your level.  Which is leading me to think you have not really taken into consideration the things you are really using NOW.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.  Take if for what you will...<br />
<br />
And if you want to know, I'd take <br />
1) 5/5 Ferocity<br />
2) 3/5 Feral Instict<br />
3) 2/2 Brutal Impact<br />
4) 2/2 Feline Swiftness<br />
-You can have this all by level 21, basically giving you that little bit faster travel speed in cat form until you get travel form at level 30. Then I'd hit up:<br />
5) 1/1 Nature's Grasp<br />
6) 4/4 Improved Nature's Grasp<br />
7) 5/5 Furor<br />
8) 1/1 Feral Charge<br />
-Now you are at level 32 and with this you will have a lot of utility for your level, from here there are many options available.  If you like feral and want a good quick dps boost you could take Natural Weapons in balance, or maybe Natural Shifter to cut downtime while grinding your quests.  You could go heavy into feral to get Heart of the Wild, but the talents along the way aren't as useful while leveling in my opinion while compared to other utility based talents.  Another very good option would be to take up some more resto at this point like Nature's Focus and Imp. Healing Touch working your way up to pick up Nature's Swiftness by level 47.<br />
<br />
Anyways, my point.  Just do what you like while you are leveling.  Explore your class.  Don't worry about wasting points.  If you are improving areas which you really use, its not a waste.  When you hit that point around level 50-60 and you decide you have outgrown the need for some talents or you play style changes, then you can worry about respeccing.  Its only 1 gold the first time, I guarantee you will have 1g.  And at that point you will know your class, and will be able to make an educated plan to your spec, one that fits you among all the templats.  You will understand why these templats exist and are so popular.<br />
<br />
So just enjoy your class, worry about points later.  Learn all you can while leveling and enjoy the now instead of focusing on what's going to happen at 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are really set on going feral, I would highly encourage you to research warriors and rogue classes, since this is the area you will be emulating.  Learn how agro works and how to grab it and hold it.  Obviously who better to learn from than experience tanks.  Though know that druids have some differences.  Also check out how to work as a rogue.  Its not really that hard to figure out, but it helps to have some background.  But again there are some differences as a druid.  All in all its a long learning curve but if you put in the time it will show...<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy.  There is nothing in this game like that trip on that first character to 60.</div></div><hr />
