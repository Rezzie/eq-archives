<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Frog Wars continue!<br />
<br />
I've posted a couple times here on various threads about the escalating battle over wandering frogs in PoS.   I'll spare the background since I've already covered it (if you don't know about loroks in PoS, just ask, and I'll point you to those threads).  Just a few days ago, I posted about a necro who spent a good half hour dispelling my pet frog while I was pulling forest giants to kill.<br />
<br />
Advance to this morning.  Different necro.  Same moronic tactic.<br />
<br />
I logged in this morning, find no one on the north wall, and I can see two or three frogs wandering around in the immediate area.   I charm one and get it buffed for forest giants.   I kill three smooth as silk, then kill the pet (which is at 8% health), while I go AFK to med up and do typical morning things.<br />
<br />
I come back about 10 mins. later, see a frog wandering by, and charm it.  I'm buffing it up when a necro (not the same one as a few days ago) comes by and says, &quot;Frogs are taken.&quot;   Remember that I am standing there surrounded by big blue corpses.  I point out that I am hunting giants, not frogs, and also, loroks are wandering mobs, and wandering mobs cannot be camped.   <br />
<br />
His immediately response is to dispel my frog.  He's not as smart as the other necro, because he is using a weaker dispel and only charm drops, not charm and snare.  I reroot with my legs.  He dispels the root.   This continues a short bit.   I finally get fed up and tell him that because of his rudeness, I am forced to teach him a lesson.<br />
<br />
He makes some comment about how he's really scared, and then runs off for a minute.  He then tells me that he's reported me for training.  Of course, my idea of a &quot;lesson&quot; is to go off and kill all the frogs that have been spawning while he's been busy dispelling my pet.  The best lesson for cretins like this is to gain XP while they gain none.<br />
<br />
I kill the several frogs that are up, then I figure that perhaps he's decided to give up.  I go back to killing giants, and you know who shows up again.  This time, instead of casting dispel (I suspect he's afraid I've called a GM on him from before), he starts casting right behind me, then interrupting his spell casts.  I believe he's trying to make me nervous, not realizing that after months of killing summoning mobs with a pet, I don't have nerves anymore.<br />
<br />
After it's finished, I get blindsided by another frog.  No biggie, I run off and control it, but I can't help but notice a FD'ed necro behind me.  I figure he's decided to take up training.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the frog add dies and I pull the last giant.  The charm breaks (or was dispelled) when the giant was at 8%, but I decide to tough it out.  I root my pet, then engage in a bit of slam/summon kiting with the giant.  I have him down to 1% when another frog gets brought over by my friend the necro.  I figure I'd rather live this one out, so evac then gate back.<br />
<br />
I recharm my pet and set it on the frog add.  Charm drops or gets dispelled.    Necro says that he's not dispelling my frog, but it's just that his being there is making me nervous, and my lack of skillz are showing.   I shrug, and kill another 4 frogs that have spawned.<br />
<br />
It's now about an hour later, and it's time to head to work.  Before I can camp, however, the necro gives up and says something in ooc (when there are only two of us in the zone, ooc is rather pointless) about how he hopes the &quot;elitist&quot; bastard enjoys hunting the frogs.   <br />
<br />
He left before I could tell him that the last hour of hunting frogs was the most enjoyable frog hunt I've had in ages.<br />
<br />
I can only shake my head at the behavior of these folks.   I want to come in, farm the 6 to 8 giants I can easily reach (or perhaps some ocean giants, if I have the time), then head back out.  There's nothing on the loroks for me (in contrast to the giants), and the only reason I have to interact with a lorok at all is to make a pet of it.   <br />
<br />
By screwing around with dispelling my pet, they're only guaranteeing that I start killing frogs.  Look at the necro this morning.   In the hour he was harassing me, I got to kill about 9 or so frogs, as well as some giants.  HE could have had those 9 frog kills if he had been focused on that instead of being a twit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't done any charming in PoS in over a month.  I certainly hope this is not happening on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batou062671</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should have petitioned him silently as dispelling a charmed mob is an attempt at getting a player killed which is against the PnP.  GM might/might not have shown up but if they saw him do it while invisible, or train you while invisible.  It might not work but it can't hurt and if a GM does show up and see it then it's game over for the person dispelling your mobs.<br />

6. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.<br />
<br />
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes, but is not limited to::<br />
<br />
o Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area. <br />
<br />
o Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past. <br />
<br />
o Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR. <br />
<br />
o Making excessive and inappropriate use of public channels of communications (/shout, /ooc, etc.). <br />
<br />
o Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses, abusing spell effects, etc.).<br />
<br />
o Causing intentional experience loss to other players (deliberately impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, intentionally training NPCs on other players, etc.).<br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
It sure seems like he was trying to cause the last for you, intentional experience loss to other players.  You also were not monopolising all of the frog spawns in the area prior to his actions.  In fact, by the play nice policy the frogs CANNOT be a camp because to call them as a camp is &quot;Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SilleyEskimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That necro certianly needs to learn how to train properly.  Perhaps a bard or wizard could show him some technique?</div></div><hr />

Next time that ass clown trains you and FDs right next to you:<br />
<br />
(1) root mob right next to him<br />
(2) back up and charm and haste it<br />
(3) break charm<br />
(4) minor heal his FD ass to death<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know what he was doing a violation of the PNP, and I could have petitioned him, but little point.  I don't mind handling some of the little stuff by myself (and yes, a necro that needs to learn how to train is &quot;little stuff&quot;).<br />
<br />
Like with the group that sent their necro over to do this a few days ago, I don't really want to train them or kill them.  I had 20 or so forest giants rounded up accompanying my former pet, but I only used them as a screen to prevent the group from getting to my frog while I evacced out and gated back.  I could have dumped them on the group, but I don't want to sink to that level.<br />
<br />
Of course, a more persistent necro might get the oh-no-the-charm-broke-on-my-frog-right-where-you-FDed-here-let-me-heal-you treatment...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Erm, healing someone that's feigned doesn't break feign...it hasn't for a long, long time.  If it ever worked at all, it was over two years ago.</div></div><hr />

There is a reason why you watch your monks die unless you see &quot;Clear.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The REALLY sad thing here is that folks would rather make life miserable for someone else than to try to find new hunting spots/tactics.  In that hour he spent trying to make you go away he could have been working a new zone or camp that he could add to his list of places to hunt.  If I ever find myself wishing someone else would die so I could get my camp-that's-not-even-a-camp that's the day I quit EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, the reason you wait for a monk to say it's clear to heal is that any aggro he has will transfer to the healer if he stands before the heal lands, or if feign is broken by an NPC's spell before the heal lands.  (NPCs will continue to cast any spells that were started before the feign, and even if they're resisted they will break feign.)  As long as the monk stays down, heals will not transfer aggro regardless of whether a successful memwipe occurred.  Healing, or any player spell that can be cast without duelling (or being in a pvp area or on a pvp server) will never break feign.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&lt;strong&gt;In that hour he spent trying to make you go away he could have been working a new zone or camp that he could add to his list of places to hunt.&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The really sad thing is that I wasn't even hunting frogs.  There is little point to me killing loroks since I don't need XP anymore.  In that hour he spent trying to make me go away he could have been killing another wave or three of loroks.  I suppose he didn't believe that I was killing giants, although he had the corpses there staring him in the face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why were you there?  Surely you haven't gone mad and decided that mindlessly killing things for no gain is fun?  It's better to leave the XP stuff for the people who can benefit from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">FGs drop stuff that sells nicely, and ocean giants drop tradeskill stuff that is not sold anywhere by anyone (because so few people hunt them anymore).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Maody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Back in time i noticed that wandering frogs dont head back to forest if you pull them to a corner in desert and evac out.<br />

Once i parked 5 frogs there to drain the respawn in a very similar battle with a wizzie claiming frogs camped. Was pure fun, cause not beeing able to track he had no idea what happend to &quot;his&quot; spawns :) <br />

Dunno if they still behave like after recent pathing changes.</div></div><hr />

Besides... it's not like you care if you die what with all those AA points!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Alaten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sorry Scirocco about your luck with people in PoS and frogs. I have the same issue on Brell. <br />
<br />
Setup: 5am EST I head over to PoS for farming some widebladed greatswords with my druid and cleric and I park over by N wall and snag a hurricane (nothing else up, so I snag a hurricane to clear bears (for them nifty boots and even kill a couple giants). <br />
In the process of 20 mins I roll over to the fort for some fun inside when a couple of frogs appear, I kill them and re-charm a typhoon and continue on my way to the front of the fort... suddenly an OOC from the only other person in the zone saying &quot;frogs camped leave&quot;. I ignore him and kill the two giants in the front of the fort. While medding another frog wanders by so I snag him and switch pets to the new healthy wanderer typhoon. He comes over and /ooc's &quot;frogs are camped&quot; and tells me to leave. He said he's been quad kiting them for hours and I /tell him that I'm really just killing giants, not interested in frogs. He /ooc's again that he saw me kill two frogs and I'm messing up his quad kiting and that he'll make sure I don't get any more frogs. (At this point I'm smiling while looking at track)<br />
For the next hour I killed every single frog while he basically chased me around trying to KS me. (I soe'd my frog and have the right click haste neck). <br />
<br />
The next hour the wizard starts in on personal attacks, emotes, threatens to &quot;handle&quot; me and so on. I had a blast :P<br />

One person cannot outdamage a hasted lorok.   All the wizard is doing is helping your targets go down (slightly) faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PraxxRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Times like these ... don't you wish you played on Rallos? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Geez too many jerks out there. We all play EQ cause we having fun with it.  Now training someone or dispell a charmed pet is just plain rude.  Why do these people have to make other's life misable? I wish I could meet them in RL and kick the crap out of them or something. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no need for that.  I was pulling doomfires to FR ramp one night and this jerk was dispelling my snares/DoTs.  Well, he seems to really hate my guild but the general server opinion of his is that he is a jerk.<br />
<br />
Anyways, instead of using egress and train him (dispelling my mob put him on the aggro list), I took the high road.  And no, I didn't petition him.  I did something much more fun.<br />
<br />
I memmed Burst of Flame and used that to pull.  When he dispelled my doomfire, it went straight for him and killed him.<br />
<br />
He rezzed up and dispelled my pulls again.  I think he had a clicky dispell ring from Ssra since he didn't even bother to med up after his rez.  He, of course, died a 2nd time.  At which point, he gated out and stopped bothering me.<br />
<br />
And the best part?  I took his spot in the group that he just left!  A group of his guildies no less.  I guess, they didn't have such a high opinion of him either.</div></div><hr />
