<br />
Since most tend to agree that this is an awesome ring for druids, as do I, I did quite a bit of research on the quest and put together a little guide from start to finish on it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what you have to do to get the rewards (yes, plural!):<br />
<br />
<br />
There are two quests to kick this one off. If you do one, you won't be able to do the other. But it doesn't really matter which you do.<br />
<br />
The first quest (which I did) is given out by Marlene Redpath in Western Plaguelands:  Little Pamela (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5142)<br />
<br />
The alternate quest is given out by Jessica Redpath in Winterspring: Sister Pamela (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5601)<br />
<br />
Once you find Pamela Redpath in the town of Darrowshire in Eastern Plaguelands, she gives the quest Pamela's Doll (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5149). That quest requires you to find the three parts of her doll, put it back together and return it to her. <br />
<br />
After that, Pamela gives out two more quests:<br />
<br />
Uncle Carlin (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5241), who is found at the Argent Dawn flight path camp in Eastern Plaguelands<br />
Auntie Marlene (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5152), who is in a house south of the Ruins of Anderhol in Western Plaguelands<br />
<br />
Marlene Redpath (Auntie Marlene) gives out a quest that leads you to a fellow named Chromie in Western Plaguelands called A Strange Historian (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5153), and then Chromie gives you the quest The Annals of Darrowshire (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5154). When you complete that, Chromie sends you to find Carlin Redpath (Uncle Carlin) in the quest Brother Carlin (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5210).<br />
<br />
Once you find Carlin Redpath he offers two quests, Defenders of Darrowshire (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5211) and Villains of Darrowshire (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5181). <br />
<br />
Once you have completed those quests he gives Heroes of Darrowshire (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5168). This quest is currently bugged in that there is no XP reward, so I would just plan on not getting any reward for this step. By the time they fix it you'll be 60 anyway, if not already.<br />
<br />
After you have completed that quest, he gives you Marauders of Darrowshire (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5206), where you have to kill umpteen Scourge Champions before you end up with five good skulls. Once completed that leads to Return to Chromie (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5941), who gives you the final &quot;real&quot; quest, The Battle of Darrowshire (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5721). This is a very difficult quest which you are epected to do with one group. After having finished this (failed first attempt with 11, succeeded the second time with 13) I honestly don't know how anyone could do it with one group. The way it works though, is you can do the quest with as many people as you want, just don't be in a raid. In fact, someone just walking by after the event could go complete this quest, there's nothing required other than to be at this point in the quest and to have had someone successfully completed the Battle. Expect lots of deaths for everyone, and instruct people to run from the graveyard rather than waiting for a rezz (the town is right next to the GY). <br />
<br />
Once you have successfully completed the event and saved Joseph Redpath's spirit, he will instruct you to speak to his daughter Pamela. Pamela gives the Hidden Treasures (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=5942) quest, along with a key to open a chest bewhind the house. In the chest are your three rewards:<br />
<br />
Ring of Protection (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=15855)<br />
Archlight Talisman (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=15856)<br />
Magebane Scion (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=15857v)</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">firetaine</div><div class="date">09-28-2005, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started this quest at 55, and its all been pretty straightforward.  Am 57 now and have the final quest 'The Battle of Darrowshire' in my log book...the hardest part so far has been trying to find a raid group together to get the last part done.  Marauders was a little tricky, the Scourge Champions are 59-60, and they have a mortal strike spell, which means if ur a bit lower then them, its gonna be close.  Just to go into detail a little more about the Marauder quest, the scourge champions drop 'Fetid Skull' which you must loot, and then use your crystal from Carlin Redpath on it.  If it turns to a resonating skull, well done =) If it turns to bone dust, BLNT!!  For me the conversion rate of fetid skull --&gt; resonating skull seemed to be about 30%.  Horde are around both areas, so expect a few deaths too.<br />
<br />
Good luck =))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawdawg</div><div class="date">02-23-2006, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished the final quest part last night - Battle of Darroshire.  We tried it first with a well-equipped group of 5 60s.  There is just too much to keep track of for a group of 5.  You could do it if all you had to do was defend your group and kill mobs.  But you have to chase around an NPC and keep him safe.<br />
<br />
Then we formed a raid of 10 people.  Completed teh battle and while still in the raid I was able to talk to redpath and complete the quest and talk to Pamela and collect my reward.  So the long and short of it is - you need about 10 people to complete and the quest allows the final Battle of Darrowshire to be raided.</div></div><hr />
