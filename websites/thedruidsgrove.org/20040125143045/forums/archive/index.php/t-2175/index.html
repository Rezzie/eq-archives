<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can solo hill giants at 33 if you grab a KEI. The loots more than pay for the KEI donation. Bind near zone and port out to sell FS. Ocasionally you might get a HG that just resists everything you cast. If that happens gate/zone and come back to find a different one. I started kiting them at lvl 29 solo. Very doable. <br />
<br />
When you hit 39 or so I suggest quading Spirocs in TD. Loot is terrible but you can hit 51 in no time. Then you can hit Cobalt Scar at 51 (could go there at 49 actually) and make some very decent loots quading wyverns. <br />
<br />
If your brave, you can start charming in PoN or PoD at 54ish. At that point 61 is in your grasp in a few days. <br />
