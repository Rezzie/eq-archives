<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While may items are purchased via adventure points, we understand that some items are still dropped from mobs or found in chests.<br />
<br />
For the benefit of our druid community, please post these dropped and treasure chest items here.<br />
<br />
Also, to accumulate bragging points, post your customized augmented items here!  (maybe you can trade your bragging points for something later on, he he.)</div></div><hr />

Was a great drop for my druid, now I don't have to spend 100k+ on a ceramic incense burner =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I added plus 5 mr aug to my windriders trinket.  I like resists...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got a idol from a mini named.  Was range slot with Vengence 2 - mellee, would know more but I lost the roll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Balise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mini Named on Hard collection quest dropped a cloak with  FTII  and plenty of stats, wis10, mana90, hp&gt;50, and some int, and I think str or stam.<br />
<br />
The harder dungeons definately drop better stuff or at least drop stuff more frequently as we also got a +7 FR augmentation gem in the same dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deabbas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Got some so-so ish DRU/MNK/BST legs with like 18ac 6wis, sta, dex, 40hp/mana and a reccomended level of 60. From a mini on normal level in MM. (____ Shadowmaster)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DigginsEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found this screenshot link on the FoH forums.  They came from an elemental difficulty Mistmoore raid and a VT difficulty Rujark raid.  That Glowing Ring of Eternal Slumber is very nice IMO.  Be warned that it's a large screenshot and takes a bit to load.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fayne Dethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got a +12 hp augment from a random mob in a MM dungeon.  The +12 hp and +12 mana augments seem the best &quot;random&quot; augments so far.<br />
<br />
So can you select the difficulty of the raid or is it automatically detected? <br />
<br />
Also, any idea if the Earring of Spirited Minds with right click lunar whispers is from elemental or vex thal difficulty?   The stats on it suck which leads me to believe its VT level, but you never know.   Never do VT or emperor anymore so getting lunar whispers type effect is a pain, and Quarm is still a long ways off for me for his version of it, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lunar whispers neck drops in acrylia caverns off the burrower beast, used to be 1-2 groupable easily, not sure how hard it is now</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fayne Dethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I tried camping the burrower beast for awhile.   Didnt avail to much as its either permacamped or the spawn cycle screws up.   The very few chances I did get a chance to kill it, it either got bugged or dropped crap.   Much easier to get such an item in a LDON raid ;p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Looking forward to getting something like this soon from vendors.  One of very few items with 2 focus abilities.<br />

edit: nm! found the link to the database below. Between that and Alla's I can keep checking stuff out. Thanks!</div></div><hr />
