I am leveling a Shadow Priest because a healer needs to feel &quot;the power&quot; every once in a while.  :thumbsup: <br />
<br />
However, I'll admit while playing my Priest, I still find myself reaching for Rebirth (B-Rez) when a pull goes bad....;)</div></div><hr />

Why??  The group of people I play with have migrated through 3 servers as they try to match up with other RL friends.  And I'm too cheap to transfer each time.  And an Alt-aholic.  Just be glad I didn't try to list all my alts of other classes...  Only one 70 though, a BM Hunter.<br />
<br />
But with Rhus being so close to 70, I'm sticking with her, come what may.  I haven't played any of the Hordies for 6-8 months.</div></div><hr />

My total days played on my druid is about double the rest of my toons combined.  Most of that was spent in MC / BWL unfortunatley.  <br />
<br />
A few months ago I decided to go back to my druid and spec 13/11/37 and run BG's (wanted to play WoW that nite, but didn't want to wipe on Archimonde with my Warlock because idiots couldnt figure out how to use their tears and stay away from fire), and have been having tons of fun.  I jump on him every so often and do BG's for an hour or two.  I really miss playing my Druid... but playing with RL friends &gt; solo.  And I don't want to level another druid (still trying to gear up my warrior)...</div></div><hr />
