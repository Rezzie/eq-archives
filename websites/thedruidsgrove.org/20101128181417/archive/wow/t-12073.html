<br />
I don't know how to phrase this without coming across as whinging or feminist or whatever... so I'm just going to ask the question and hope that you all take it as the genuine enquiry that it is.  <br />
<br />
Has the voicechat option which will be coming to WoW has been already tested on any realms?  If so what are the experiences of female players that have used it?  At present when I play with PuGs, gender isn't an issue (the other players probably figure I'm likely to be male) but that'll end with voicechat.  Have any female players had any bad / tiresome experiences that have spoilt their gaming or am I being unnecessarily concerned?<br />
<br />

And when I am in my healing set, I am DEAD SEXY.  It can't be helped.  I'm quite used to the flirts and whistles.  Although, I try to refrain from dancing.  I've learned that male Night Elves can only take so much.  :grin: <br />
<br />
Seriously though, to answer your question:<br />
<br />
No.  Never had any problems.  In fact it's always been quite fun to joke around verbally.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe voice chat will be a problem either. I think this is mostly due to the fact that I don't act all giddy and childish, so I am taken just as serious as the &quot;boys&quot; are. I do enjoy having a good time in chat, but I don't let myself get perceived as someone less intelligent just because of my gender.</div></div><hr />

If you find yourself self-conscience over the situation just tell them you don't have a mic and while you can hear them, you unfortunately cannot reply.  Most people will understand that.</div></div><hr />

PUGs are different. But there is a silver lining to this cloud. Wouldn't you rather know you're in a group with a Neanderthal before you get deep into the instance rather than later on? We males have to figure it out the hard way :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Voice chat- so easy even a cav...&quot;. Sorry, not being PC, am I?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty stupid stereotyping imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty close to my guildies, and if I PuG with anyone we are usually WoW buddies by the end of the Instance.  Everyone knows that in RL, I'm Married and Mom to two teens.  Nobody has ever doubted my game play or even asked me why I play.  In fact, they kind of think it's cool.  So, I'd say the worst that happens to me is that I get whispers from teenagers asking for RL advise.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I've not done with voice chat on WOW directly, only Team Speak with guild or people I already knew. I'm in a similar boat: 47 single mom with a teen and married son in his 20s. I play mostly with my not-official fiancee, one of his adult children, and my teen son and his friends. I've been worried about doing the chat with PUGs: I probably shouldn't assume I'll be condescended to, but I also don't want to take the chance that someone will treat me like an utter noob. (I do know that a pally shouldn't be &quot;needing&quot; on leather armor!) Don't get me wrong: I have tons to learn, and I know it. But I at least have the presence of mind not to run into a big group of baddies and drag them back to the healer who's been saving their butts. :burn:</div></div><hr />

Not to say there aren't some creeps out there, but I say don't worry about it unless they give you something to worry about. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmpirish</div><div class="date">10-12-2007, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never had a problem, but then I've only been on Vent/TS with guild groups.  In both those cases, people really didn't care about my gender and there were usually other women on so I wasn't unique.<br />
<br />
I've never done voice chat with a PuG, though.  With some PuGs, that's probably just as well seeing as the /party chat can be enough to make me want to stab myself in the eye.  :axe:<br />
<br />
The only comment someone made to me regarding my gender was an expression of surprise I run a male toon (not a big fan of the female tauren look, alas) and that I like to tank.  In this particular case it wasn't offensive or anything, it was more of a novelty to the person that I was breaking a few stereotypes.</div></div><hr />

You'd be surprised at how many RL Males I know who are playing Female Human Paladins.  I sure was.  :whistle:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking more of the issues of using voicechat with PuGs.  TS with my guildies and mates is good fun and we all enjoy banter.  I hadn't thought of the 'I've not got a mic' option... it may be one to consider whilst I review the situation.<br />

I've had a few people who have been shocked to find out at the end of a instance that i'm female 'zomg your a girl and can play' and have even been kicked from a group once or twice before the instance has started. But tbh I don't wanna heal those jerks anyway!<br />
<br />
the guild were a bit shocked when I first joined but these days i'm taken for one of the lads. They still go all mushy over new girls tho :p</div></div><hr />
