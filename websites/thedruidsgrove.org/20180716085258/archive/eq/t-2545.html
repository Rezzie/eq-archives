<br />
There are lots of guides and threads about DC but not so much for normal charming.<br />
<br />
I am level 56 and am interested in knowing the difference between the various charm spells. Is it essential to use Call of Karana and if so why?<br />
<br />
I have all of the charm spells up to my level except this one as all I seem to get from the trade in NPC is egress and Glamour of Tunare.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of trying charming out in Scarlet Desert so I am after any tips that are going to help me not die horribly everytime my pet decides to break charm:)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

i personally am most fond of maidens, chardok, and sirens grotto for this.<br />
<br />
maidens, exclusively go for ravenous beasts... <br />
they regen really fast, hit hard, and have like 15-20k hp.<br />
they are right on the borderline of being charmable,<br />
so it takes awhile to find the a good one sometimes... <br />
but its all worth it.<br />
<br />
chardok, sniffers are good ;), fleshrippers seem to keep the<br />
charm relatively ok as well.<br />
<br />
sg has some nice options also ;)<br />
<br />
i usually start of with glamour of tunare<br />
follow with ensnare (aka leash)<br />
this will prevent annul from cancelling my pet-ness. :)<br />
in addition to increasing chance and length of charm.<br />
now i call of karana while the soon-to-be pet is beating on me... or if i have the option of running around while i'm charming, then i do that.  (sg doesnt allow for too much movement)<br />
<br />
in maidens, i tend to keep my beast.. so i buff it with all i can.<br />
str, skin, regen, nature recovery, ds, savage pet (very very nice haste!!!)... throw on whatever you got ;)<br />
just make sure to ensnare every time you lose the charm, before you recharm.... coz they get real nasty-like...<br />
<br />
using maidens, for example, i solo the 3-pop and 2-pop<br />
coterie camps, the chief camp (the whole thing), scouts are little tougher - but also did those...<br />
<br />
chardok, with a charmed sniffer i can hold the front fort...<br />
gonna try observer soon as i get my dire charm :)<br />
<br />
overall... its pretty fun.<br />
<br />
charm breaks are random... sometimes lasting 10 seconds<br />
and sometimes lasting like 7 mins...  gets annoying sometimes.<br />
<br />
lots of theories wether CHA actually helps<br />
<br />
for what its worth, it *seems* to help me, maybe its just placebo :)<br />
<br />
<br />
but anyway ... have fun, and dont be afraid to experiment..<br />
worst that happens is you die :)</div></div><hr />

I belive that at least most of what he listed can be dire charmed and thus you can use you lovely new non aggro charm.<br />

<br />
So it has its uses but they arent very common if you are exps hunting.<br />
<br />
I charm often but always use Glamour, snare, then Call of Karana.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the places listed above work great but you will want/need Call of Karana for them.<br />
<br />
As far as charisma - the official Verant stand point is that cha has an effect but it is minimal in the over all scheme of things with your level vs level of animal and animals mr being the bigger factors.<br />
<br />
I do notice a significant improvement with 100+ cha as a druid, but anything higher I dont see anything change. I charm at 109 cha most days which is really only 3 swaps (Shield of Bane Warding 8cha, Tunarean ring 10cha, and Tranix Crown 20) so it doesnt effect my other stats much.<br />
<br />
With my enchanter I notice significant improvements at 100, 150, 200+ but anywhere in between those milestones I see little to no change as I would at the level below it. ie. 178 cha is no better than 150 in my eyes. Thats personal observations only though.</div></div><hr />

So from what I found about 1 in 6 is charmable.<br />
<br />
My favorite is Chardok.  Usually do exit/fort.<br />
Snare the dog, Call of Karana, DS it.  Pull another mob (try to use di'zoks as the mob, as to not waste charmable critters), root it and set the pet on it.  Maybe throw in a DoT if you have spare mana/epic. Pull another mob and set pet on it also after rooting it in place.  Before this mob dies your pet will be getting low.  Just before your pet dies, break charm.  3 ways to do this. 1. Hide if you have it.  Not very reliable but saves a spell slot.  2. Superior Camo.  Reliable but takes up a spell slot and takes time to cast.  3. Annul the mob, not good becuase it stripps all the spells on the mob including snare.  Once you break charm kill your ex-pet and if its still alive the mob it was attacking.  So you should have just killed 3 mobs with only using max 1 bub mana, which should have regened while your pet was tanking the mob.  Plus with the exit right there you don't need to save mana for an egress and can run to safety if the need arises.<br />
<br />
I've never ever used Glamour, to me it just takes up a spell slot which I am already in short supply of.  For me charm does not have to last terribly long, maybe about 2-3 minutes.  And the point being your pet is supposed to die, means this wouldn't work with DC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I continue to recharm the same dog for hours.<br />
<br />
Charm may be broken with hide, camo or when it does on its own. If it does while in a fight I root both, reglamour, resnare, recharm. Then nuke the bad guy so root breaks and then reroot him on top of my pet and have at it.<br />
<br />
When I charm I have plenty of spell slots availble as I plan on the pets being a tank and my job is just to keep them hasted/buffed and healed.<br />
<br />
Normal spell load for Chardok charming:<br />
Heal - chloro or NR depending on my gutsiness that day<br />
Thorns - yes for dog<br />
Savage Spirit<br />
Root - duh :)<br />
Nuke - moonfire inside, breath if outside normally<br />
Ensare - duh :)<br />
<br />
The last two slots are Egress/Gate, DoT, or Glamour - normally Glamour and Egress though indoors and DoT/Glamour outdoors.<br />
<br />
After a few hours of this if my pet has served me well - I kill him too! Personally from a happy master standpoint I would like to leave him but I just dont think its really fair to others for a NS, Girdled, Regrowed, Hasted and Thorned pet to be left behind... if of course there are others nearby that may get him in a pull.</div></div><hr />

Damage Shield<br />
Nuke<br />

Ensnare<br />

<br />
I'm guessing I could take out one of the heals to put the Glamour in, but I don't like to be unprepared should an emergancy happen.  I find the pets take too much damage and I'd spend all my mana healing it just to keep it alive, when I can simply kill it for XP and go charm a full health dog afterwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely worth the spell slot for Glamour IMO, I was Glamouring the swirlspine seahorses that we were killing for exp while we were waiting for Phinny to spawn (me at 54 and a 59 druid were only healers, other druid was casting RotG and nuking a lot; 8 people, only one death and it was the other druid, hah), other druid didn't have glamour, and when I kept saying %t tashed, everyone (including the other druid) was asking me what I was doing.  Uh, anyways, with Glamour they weren't being as MR as normal, I was landing snare about 95% of the time on them after glamour.</div></div><hr />

I go there, and if it's open, I can usually keep exit/entrance/fort at 58, but only if I don't go ld =p. have (in order): scorai, chloroblast(maybe sup heal, depends how I'm fealing), winged death/glamour of tunare, call of karana, savage spirit, ensnare, engorging roots, then gate. I usually try to keep high cha(129 or so). I snare a sniffer(whelps won't work) CoK it, haste it, then send if after mobs untill it's just about dead, then I invis to break charm, kill pet, and finish whatever it is it was fighting with epic. so that's like 4 kills in 5 minuts for 300 or so mana, while medding most of the time I can usually make back most of it. I then charm another sniffer, and do the same. this is awsome exp. I'll have to check out the theory of mr affecting charm time. I also find it more effective in chardok to get a new pet and kill your old one when it gets low on health rather than keeping it and healing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkconclusion</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I would post a little something as I was skimming the boards...<br />
The Cha issue is this.  Charisma is a tertiery stat.  the importance of checks on charm breaks is this(1 being the most important)<br />
<br />
1.Magic Resistance of mob<br />
2.Level of Player to mob<br />
3.Charisma<br />
<br />
Like how agi helps increase ac,and defense(dodge,miss,block,etc) abilities, cha helps resists on charms.  The break period is 3 seconds after the spell is cast, then 6 seconds after and every 6 seconds thereafter.  I have run tests timing charms to the millisecond and from what I found its the 3 initial second then 6 sec duration (click timer).  My Enchanter is at 260 cha (only shows 255) by accident, the ironic thing is when I made my trophies to get the 260 cha I got Dire Charm where cha isn't required.  Anyway, Charisma helps, but don't bother with it soo much unless your a class who uses cha for spells other than Charm.  If you want good charms use a MR debuff on mob, Enchanters have the unresistable Tashan series, Druids have the no aggro(I think) animal only debuff, and since you only charm animals it's perfect.  Makes you wonder if the spell was designed for animal charms**shrugs**.<br />

MR of the mob really does make a difference, so knocking it down is a good thing.  You dont need to keep glamour up in your spell set either.  Use your normal set, when your pet breaks root it and the mob you were killing in place.  Unmem something you dont really need like a your dot.  Mem glamour -it has a very fast load time- glamour the pet again, recharm, and sick on mob.  Then reload your DoT.  <br />
<br />
Heh, dont really need to worry about this to much if you charm/solo like Geddine and just rechose pets =)  While this is very good exp I like to select one pet, pamper it with buffs, then keep it for hours =)<br />

I just love the idea of these KOS bears tearing each other to shreds for my benefit.  I hide/invis when my charmed pet is just about to die so I can put it out of its misery and claim even more experience.<br />

Chardok with a pet I can keep up with quadding ME.

This is what I do since I have no 'magical' way of knowing the levels on rav beasts. I snare-pull a spec wolf and charm it(don't buff it yet). I park it at my camp spot and go looking for rav beasts. Snare-pull a rav beast and have a seat next to my pet. The mob will hit for full if you are sitting so if it hits you double 151 or 149, then it can be charmed. Back off and break your charm...charm the rav beast and sick it on the spec wolf. If it hits for more than 151 then back off and buff your spec wolf immediately and try again after. Just be careful, some rav beasts will enrage, so nuke hard if it does, they will tear thru a spec wolfs hit points fast.<br />
I usually pull a few mobs after to let the buffs wear off and try another rav beast.<br />
Just be sure to keep your pet and pull snared all the time...having a pet buffed with 70% haste running after you full speed can hurt heh.<br />
Oh ya, hotkey this: /pet report health....it shows what buffs are on it and the order. My pets usually show this when I do it:<br />
ensnare<br />
call of karana<br />
savage spirit<br />
shield of blades<br />
regrowth<br />
<br />
A 151 hitting rav beast is the best pet I've ever had in game....with savage spirit, max dmg shield and regrowth on it...you can kill almost non-stop without using too much mana at all.<br />
As for the charisma thing, I usually do this with 100 cha and I don't use glamour. For the most part I get long enough charms so I can't complain. Sometimes you get the 1-2 tick charms and others you get max duration so it's the luck of the draw in my experience. As long as your pet is snared, charm breaking is a minor inconvenience as long you are only single pulling. Hell, I break a long charms often to resnare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
after some extensive work the best yet is charming the black panthers. Even if you are aligned with the residents of jaggedpine (which i am max ally with) go find the darkest blue panther you can find, glamour, snare, call  and then buff buff buff.<br />
<br />
After i get my nice black cat ready, I trot him over to the irritating Potameids and I have him chew them up over and over and over again. Now this is probably not the best experience, but it is a) fun b) revenge  c) fun. <br />
<br />
Fear not if you pet dies on you while charmed, you will not get a faction hit. Just ensure if the panther must die, that he dies at the end of a fight while charmed.  <br />
<br />
Also, I used this theory to clear the entire Poacher camp, silly I know, but the most I had up once I got my routine down, was 3 poachers.<br />

I don't bother with the root in a group because I'll have to apologize for bad pet beating up the enchanter who inevitably hangs out by bad pet.  <br />

It's still a random duration.<br />
<br />
My thots on charisma have always been that it helps on the initial resist check. After that, only MR and level difference can cause a break before the random charm duration is up. Always use Glamour. :)</div></div><hr />

Why don't I use GoK?  Having a feared pet in ME isn't fun.</div></div><hr />

When you find that special wolf in Maidens you are set for the night. I have found you can solo anything in the zone that is not named (haven't tried it on any of the named). You can make many happy guildies and twinks hunting there.<br />
<br />
People say 4 arms are hard, watchem die before it can count all of its fingers. <br />
<br />
Hooded dudes harassing you? <br />
Have your wolf get medieval on his arse. <br />
<br />
Toilet heads crowding your space? <br />
Never fear Mr. Wolf has the cure. <br />
<br />
Tribals making lewd advancements toward your favorite shrub? <br />
With your wolf he will be taking a dirt nap in under a minute.<br />
<br />
Worms sucking you down?<br />
Think I better stop here.......<br />

Have fun charmin,<br />

Just snare it, RSD it -- to gain aggro -- throw on your DOTs, and THEN tell wolf to attack. Wurms are slow when snared, and rav beast can keep up with it. Make sure to throw in a nuke now and then to reinforce aggro.<br />
<br />
Then just aggro kite it to death. Wolf does all the work, you just run it around. Make sure you are doing this is a safe area or the adds will disrupt the fight.</div></div><hr />

They have no faction hit, and would seem to make a good pet to take out the gnoll cave, since they spawn frequently in that area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried charming a Timber Griffon last night and parked it outside the gnoll cave in JP.  Pulled a gnoll from just inside the tunnel.  Immediately as I cast snare on the gnoll, the charm broke, so now I'm between two hostile mobs - take a few hits.   Run around get some distance, re-charm fizzles - take some more hits.   Finally end up egressing.<br />
<br />
That was a fairly typical pull for me.  I tried about 5 mobs with a charmed griffon pet and only ended up with 2 kills.  I think I need some practice :)</div></div><hr />

It was just too cumbersome to fight your way down to a &quot;safe&quot; spot.  I tried it with a panther several times and it worked pretty well in the cave entrance, but the farther down I got the more disruptive it was to have charm break.  At one point, I had 3 adds on me when charm broke and Ensnare had just worn off on my pet, so I died hideously.  <br />
<br />
If you want to charm there, I'd recommend grabbing an anaconda and run around smacking griffs, anacondas or Potemaids.<br />

So I grab grink1 and clear alice and archers.  Great xp too, can't wait for dire charm.  I haven't really bothered using glamour though, seems grink is lacking in the MR dept.  Supplement pet damage with Blades, Drones and Epic.  Sometimes throw on WD if I can afford the mana.  Savage spirit also works great, but I've been caught off guard a couple times and almost been eaten alive by my rat friend, hehe.  <br />
Buff myself with PotC, MotS, SoW, Bladecoat and RotG.  Also have FT1 and MC1 and that usually provides enough mana, but if I have a messy fight usually means medding for a while.  With KEI, can pretty much go non-stop.</div></div><hr />

Mangler are pretty okay too, another name i don't remember which pop'd otw to herbalist were nice, all rest are bad charm breaker or so iirc.<br />
<br />
If you want challenge and good xp, then go to Enslaved Iksar Miner, 2% aa/ kill. Up to there nothing summon yet.<br />
<br />
If you want high challenge (call me suicidal) but xp won't be worth it compared to difficulty, then try the break of herbalist or even Overseer/Kennelmaster :) For this last part though i'd advise you start off decently buffed, even by herbalist very few mobs are summoning.</div></div><hr />
