Whether it be from defense, resilience or the combo of both. However, I can't remember what the percentage is. My defense is currently 398 and my resilience is 98 for a combined 4.41% decrease in ability to be critted. I still need a few armor upgrades but in the week since hitting 70 I've made a great deal of progress in putting together my beginner tank gear. I went into my first Kara last night as dps, and from what I was told, did ok. I had 2/3 of the Strength of the Clefthoof set crafted for me this afternoon to complete it, and put 2 sockets in each of the new pieces (ran out of gold). I'm still working on the quest chain for my Verdant Gloves, as well as the honor and marks for my Gladiator's Maul. If someone could let me know what that percentage is, I would appreciate it. You have all been very helpful, and I don't know where my druid would be right now without your help. Thank you all so much. :smile:</div></div><hr />

5.6% is correct if you DO NOT have Survival of the Fittest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since this druid does have it, only 2.6% is required.<br />
Dub, you can afford to drop a fair bit of defense or resilience.<br />

At the moment I am considering switching to Boomkin and focusing on PvP for a bit. My current guild is losing members left and right and noone ever shows up for scheduled raids. And pugging Kara when I've yet to clear it, is difficult to say the least. Nobody on my server seems to be willing to help someone get Kara gear, they all want geared players to make it easier. The only time I was in Kara we downed the huntsman and moroes, but wiped repeatedly on maiden. My main is to say the least becoming a pain. -=/</div></div><hr />

I found that kara's drops for feral druids were less than desired so i did like many before me and started pvping to replace blues with the gladiator's and vindicator's.  I guess what im finding is that with my new peices of pvp mixed in with my tank peices that i am way above the uncritable status.  common sense tells me to replace as much defense now however most of it comes from the armor...ie clefthoof, rings and mace.  i don't want to suffer stamina loss, and mostly armor loss.  i guess what i am asking is the pvp set a reliable set for replacing some tank gear?  also a bit off topic is there a reason why raids i am fine tanking, and yet heroics my threat seems much less?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">04-28-2008, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly there are many pieces of PvP gear that are very good PvE tank gear pieces. I say sadly because I think this class/spec is the only one in the game where this is as true as it is. No doubt there are good pieces here and there for other class/specs but not the same number of items. <br />
 <br />
You would have to be more specific regarding the threat issues between raiding and heroicing. What are you raiding and which heroics? The first thing that comes to mind is you might be PuGing the heroics and Lord only knows who you might end up with. Raids tend to be very structured and people generally know what they are doing regarding 1) the fight and 2) threat management.</div></div><hr />

Over the past 2-3 weeks I have done nothing but run 5-mans (some heroic most are not).  I'm lucky if 1 other person in the group is running Omen (I update mine every other day, so I don't think it is a version issue).  I wonder if most folks think of it as a Raid tool and don't see a need in 5-mans?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess that is one issue (omen = raid). Others include just not knowing or their version being out of date. For too long after 2.4 hit you had to literally update your omen every day or it wouldn't talk to out of date versions. Heck most of my guild found they had to go in and delete the pre 2.4 omen folder and then install the latest and greatest for it to work correctly.</div></div><hr />

you would only need 2.6%.<br />
<br />
39.4 Resilience = 60 Defense Rating = 25 Defense Skill = 1% less chance of being Crit.<br />
<br />
39.4 x 2.6 ~ 103res alone ( - def ) <br />
<br />
60 x 2.6 ~ 156 on all gears alone. (- res) <br />
<br />
Or<br />
<br />
combo of both. <br />

check your defenses tab on your Char ( C )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalbear</div><div class="date">06-04-2008, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best upgrade: Earthwarden.<br />
Second best - dragonhide shoulderguards, which are a pvp item you can buy from vendors.<br />
<br />
Also, a side note - just because the enchantment says 'of the bear' it does not mean it's a good item for bears. You don't care about strength nearly as much as you care about agility and armor. There are a lot of upgrades from quest rewards that you can get; many guides posted on this site indicate them. Your first focus should be to get more armor. <br />
<br />
Also note that +armor enchants are not that good for bears; they don't multiply when you change forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">archingman</div><div class="date">06-04-2008, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks kalbear ya i look at the earthwarden staff but have yet a good amount of rep to get. Will look into the dragonhide shoulderguards might be a quicker upgrade. and on the armor peace that is &quot;of the bear&quot; i went with it since i was trying to get my hit rating up. Is there a better way to do that than str.? Since +armor enchants do not change what would be good chant for gloves? And lastly what should i be getting my armor up to since it is right above 17k in bear but my def. is only 403. On a side note i am not raiding but want to be able to tank normal dungeons or heroic's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalbear</div><div class="date">06-04-2008, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strength doesn't affect hit rating at all. It affects AP, but in general you want to increase your crit before increasing your AP. And the best way to do that is with agility. As a rule, you don't have to worry that much about hit rating, at least not at your level. Threat is great for starting bears. What you need is not threat, but armor, stamina, and some avoidance.<br />
<br />
For gloves, go with the +15 agility enchant. <br />
<br />
For armor, you should get it as high as you can possibly go. The highest you ever want is 35900 in bear form, but in general here are some benchmarks:<br />
<br />
Heroics: easy ones start at 18k and more is much, much better. Ideally this should be at least 22k.<br />
<br />
Kara: 20k to start with if you're going to main tank anything. 18k for offtanking.<br />
<br />
Gruul: depending on your role, 20k to 25k. The more you can do on Gruul himself the better.<br />
<br />
Magtheridon: 24k or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keonebear<br />
can't see the armoury via the firewall here but i assume you have the Heavy Clefthoof Set ?<br />
<br />
also the Resolute Cape is quite nice if you can get the mats and get it crafted as it has a reasonable amount of resilience.<br />
<br />
depending upon your rep with various factions there are some nice Glyphs to purchase with +def or +resilience.  apologies that i cannot remember them all or search any sites for them atm. i'm sure someone else will be able to post some links.<br />
<br />
also on your way top getting Earthwarden you can get http://thottbot.com/i29173 which is a very nice neck with +def and some dodge.</div></div><hr />
