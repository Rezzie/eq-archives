<br />
I mainly did PvP from 50-60, but that's a personal choice.  I enjoy PvP a lot more than PvE, so PvP made getting from 50-60 fun for me, instead of a drag.  When I needed to grind XP, I headed to those farms in the Western Plaguelands; they have mobs that are easy to solo so you can get a good XP gain rate (and lots of runecloth to boot!)<br />
<br />
I've never had a guildie help power level me, so I can't offer input on that...but there's my 2 cents nonetheless.<br />

Got my Warlock to 60 through various ways but completely solo'd my Hunter to 60 using questing mainly through to 60.  Got my Hunter to 60 in about 7 days played although I did spend time skinning and mining alot, and selling.<br />
<br />
If you literally just quest, get cash and important drops then the time would have been maybe a 1/2 - 1 day off that.<br />
<br />
Using the same method I used on the Hunter to get my Druid up to 60, currently 37.<br />

<br />
Playing solo from 50 - 60 or any level is just possible by killing mobs and gettin xp in that way . Doing Silithus quests some of ungoro , Blackrock , Scholomance , and any other isntance quests is not possible to solo , so you didnt solo , you got from 50 to 60 by doing instances and quests and I m sure you didnt run instances alone .<br />
<br />
If you wanna level up to 60 fast , do the quests ( instance quest as well ) and that's it . If anyone here can get 60 by doing quests alone than he is really mighty and good player .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Entirely possible.  Un'goro, Silithus, Azshara, Winterspring, the Plaguelands, Felwood.  Loads of quests and killing of mobs for those quests.<br />
<br />
Admittedly though you tend to run out about 1/2 way through 59.  Could go back and do some others you missed.<br />

I checked our Jame's Leveling guide and skipped any of the quests that required groups and did some off topic grinding and rose about 1 lvl every other day playing 3-4 hours a night. Its a good guide...skips some good stuff, but like me you can always come back after 60 :)</div></div><hr />

My second druid I just did lvl 50 to 54 mostly solo, took about 4-5 hours per level which wasn't bad at all.  I'm going to grind out the next level mostly in AV since I want honored at 55 anyway and then I know i can easily do 55-60 in winterspring, plaguelands and sithilus, though I'll probably start doing some instances since I have a lot of lvl 40-44 gear still, heh.<br />

/played is 5 days at lvl 54 mostly solo with a bit of BG's thrown in.</div></div><hr />

Soloing to 60 is without a doubt much faster, however i find it really hard to do, especially since it involves lots of grinding which can get quite boring (to me at least). Whereas in group running instances or doing quests with friends can take a little longer because your not getting the full exp. basically imo, if u have the resolve and the dedication to just get it done, solo yourself to 60.  Or solo yourself and then go BG every once in awhile or run some high lvl instances as your lvling like brd.  Theres no reason to pick choose one thing and stick with it when WoW lets you  do so many different things to lvl up. i know a friend who got from 52 to 60 just off BGs because he doesnt like soloing or running instances. to each his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lumbergh</div><div class="date">12-05-2006, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if there's any good Argent Dawn gear for a Druid, but at least you'll have some context when grinding.  It all starts at lvl 50, go to Chillwind Point in Western Plaguelands.  Make sure you obtain and _equip_ the Argent Dawn trinket, so that the mobs will drop Scourgestones.  Then grind the Undead mobs for rep.  This works until Honored.<br />
<br />
Do the WPL quests, including the chain of cauldrons.  At first, you have to get a key from the cauldron lord and then get a sample.  Then, you'll come back to poison the cauldron for repeatable quests.<br />
<br />
Do not turn in the stones until you are Honored (or Revered, depending on how patient you are).  Start grinding in Eastern Plaguelands, do all the quests you can, and if you're a resto Druid perhaps you can get into some Scholo pug's at lvl 58.  The infamous &quot;45-min Baron run&quot; will get you 150 reputation, so practice as much as you can. Edit: can't remember whether Baron is Strat or Scholo, they're both in EPL.<br />
<br />
 :sumo: <br />
<br />
I also discovered some A.D. quests in Winterspring, but that area is around lvl 54 or so.<br />
<br />
Set your hearthstone to Southshore, so you can still do some BRD runs in between grinding sessions.  I wouldn't start doing BRD until lvl 55, but that's the great debate.  Some people love doing instances when they're lower lvl.</div></div><hr />

Though, in retrospect, I wish I hadn't... I feel as if I rushed the game and missed a lot of the details and lore, which I did. I plan on reading out every quest some day, etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I mainly posted to comment on the AD rewards. Yes, there are druid items. Sanctified Leather Helm is a great healing item. So are Band of Piety and Verimonde's Last Resort. AD rep also gives an 18 slot bag! If you get exalted, there is a nice amulet as well.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't hand in the stones until you hit revered. Past revered--according to blizzard and from what I have heard--monsters stop giving  you reputation, so you can only hand in stones. I'm saving all of mine for revered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">12-06-2006, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya Veriden...sometimes I regret it too, but going from 41 to 60 in about 4 weeks was worth it IMO. I lost out on some things, but now that I'm 60 I get to do even more interseting/rewarding tasks. Plus all my friends had been playing WOW for over a year and I wanted to catch up fast to group up. Funny thing is, now I have better gear than most of them! and sometimes find myself helping them out in instances to gear up!<br />
I too want to get into the Lore, but at my own pace, not at the detriment of getting the &quot;real&quot; content of the game. Even on these forums when I would ask about gear when I was low, the same response would be &quot;don't worry about it until 60&quot;, so I didn't and plowed through quest after quest...lol I still had several greens when I got to 60. BUT, that all changes at 60. I grouped up and did well and got reinvited, plus lucky drops along the way and now I'm getting into Tier 2.</div></div><hr />
