 <br />
Anyhow, my gear was never the most uber out there, but I did okay. Nowadays though, I'm seeing stuff that blows my mind! My guild apparently disbanded before Brell and CT merged (Anyone from brell remember Sonorous?Heh) So I'm guildless atm. thus I cant get any of the big raid only drops. <br />
 <br />
I know my wrists really really need to go, before I left I was trying to get the ornate leather wristbands for the FT..err..mana regen now it's called I guess. Magelo is in my sig gang, thanks ahead of time for any suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">05-29-2006, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember Sonorous! I saw you in PoK and remembered you, too. I used to come to ToV raids, lol.<br />
<br />
You'll find quite a few old Sonorous in Exemplar these days, if you want to look them up. <br />
<br />
For an easy back item (if you still have PoG faction), check out the Tree Heaven quest.<br />
<br />
There is a mission in Eldaar Forest that is a simple delivery quest. You hail Speaker Grayleaf which is a treant near the Arch Druid. After some dialog he will offer two missions. Select Tree Heaven and you will be given a seed to deliver to Plane of Growth. <br />
<br />
Head to Tunare's Tree and up the ramp and back around the platform is the npc to turn it into.<br />

Caster reward is:  Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39692)</div></div><hr />

I miss those raids, we were totally the first to clear ToV on Brell...even before the ultra elite SR did it hehe. Anyhow, thanks for the heads up about some of my old pal's as well as the cloak, I'll look into both. Anyone else have any suggestions for me?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Get scarred browband cap for head (not sure if that is spelled right?) from WoS (bought mine cheap)<br />
 <br />
Do MM#1 in icewell and the shield is common drop if you can get friends to do it if not do until you get it....NICE upgrade from what you have....of course the ring from it is RARE but very nice too (took me 16 missions to get mine). My stats are less because I am lvl 55 but you can get full stats. (get the seal if you can and try and grow the aug by doing more MM for icewell and its HUGE stats total aug is 7 to all stats/saves and 70hp/mana PLUS 7 regen and 15 avoidance!!!!<br />
 <br />
Nice caster mask in MM#3 if you get that run too.<br />
 <br />
bracers I would get at least one ethereal bracer (drops in Arcstone) and can be bought....over 100hps/mana low wis but put aug on it.<br />
 <br />
same with shoulders is mantle of spell caster or something similar to bracers in low wis but nice hps/mana.<br />
 <br />
Also there is charm out there for languages that drops in WoS (bought mine for 500pp) get someone to spam you the languages and it gets NICE stats ....think 10 or so to all stats 65hps/mana tainted heartstone...the kicker is there is aug just for charms that you do in CC (zone off nek forest) talk to clockwork guy and you turn into goblin in PoK and run around sneak hide and discover places....this too turns into powerful aug....i have only done 3 of them and have like 6 stats to all plus hps/mana.<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps you get some upgrades and I will post more as I get them....55 druid started from scratch after 3 yr break from mage (course friends helped ).<br />

I'm 67, and Bazaar equipped all the way (except epic and 8th shawl).  Check out my Magelo for more ideas.<br />
