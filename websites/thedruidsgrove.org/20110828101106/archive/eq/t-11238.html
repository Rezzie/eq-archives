I am a 51 Wood Elf Druid of Tunare deity on E'ci soon to be Tunare server. I would like to know what kind of gear would probably be best for me to get now, and still be pretty useful in the later levels. (maybe around 60-65) Platinum really isn't a problem. I am just trying to get some input so TIA. See ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">04-29-2005, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most PoP Ornate quest pieces (level 55 to do turnins I think) would probably last you through 65 and have useful focuses.  Arms imp healing, legs clicky root, boots mana pres?.  Epic 1.0 is nice from 50-65ish also, no idea what you are using since you didn't post a magelo.  Since OOW there is a lot of attuneable items that are also nice, I'm not very familiar with them though.</div></div><hr />

Nice little clicky item. Quest is located here: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2652. You also get a nice tunic from a subquest too. It's pic is below the Phylactery pic.<br />

Long, Boring Quest but very worth it in the end. :grin: <br />
 <br />
Oh and btw, the piece that drops in Oasis and South Ro is very, very rare, so don't give up if you do the quest, just takes time.</div></div><hr />

I have my epic 1.0 &amp; sorry for not having a magelo up, but it doesn't work on this computer for some reason. I think I will wait to get the Ornate, but I think I might also do that quest to get that very nice tunic. :D Bye guys</div></div><hr />
