<br />
I'm about to hit lvl 50 Tauren Druid and I'm thinking of getting a little more aggressive with my build to help with grinding out the last 10 levels (as well as have a little more fun pounding things).  <br />
<br />
So I've come up with this build that dumps 31 points into feral and, for now, 10 in resto with the remainer to go into resto tree to end the game at 0/31/20:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/talent/?zZVxMscrdpE<br />
<br />
My thinking:<br />
1) Not worried about Rage or Energy mgt plus I have 2 pts. in Primal Fury.<br />
2) Stun duration hasn't been an issue with a Tauren and Warstop and would be used to shift / heal / shift again<br />
3) Thick Hide = Good Armor<br />
4) I don't use Shred with Ferocious Bite why give it a talent point?<br />
5) I like the idea of being able to throw FF if dealing with multiple mobs in bear/cat form rather than waste mana shifting, which I won't do, thus never using FF.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to know how much I can expect to lose in healing capabilities before dropping the coin to respec?<br />
<br />
I've collected gear for Healing purposes to maximize that function as well so I don't expect (could be wrong) too much of a drop off in being able to heal on that end.  With gear, I have about 4100 mana, 220 INT and 180 SPR.  Here is my resto tree right now:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/talent/?MZZxvc0b<br />
<br />
Part of the reason, I'm looking at this is the change with innervate being a obtainable skill at lvl 40 and not a 31-point talent tree.  From what I've read, the 31 points in resto was, in large part, to acquire this skill.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any comments on both the build and rationale as well as the impact on my current ability to heal.  Now if Bliz would just make the Dire Bear look as cool as the Moonie..</div></div><hr />

Free energy / rage = more dps.  Natural Weapons helps out here a lot too.  If you are solo / grinding up to 60, and not instancing at all really, I'd go for 14 in balance, then fill out the feral tree, and put your last five points into furor.<br />
<br />
If you are going to put 20 points into resto, its kinda ridiculous not to spend one more point and go with 30 points in feral, then 21 in resto for Natures Swiftness.  Instant heals allow you to be a great instance healer, should you get put in that role, as well as increasing your survivability greatly.  Don't underestimate Natures Focus.  If you are in scholo and have 4 skeletons beating on you while you are waiting for the tank to take back aggro and you have to heal yourself or die, NF will save your bacon.  Especially cause Warstomp and NS have cooldowns.<br />
<br />
I cant see your actual build as I am at work and behind a firewall, though those would be my suggestions just looking at the tree distributions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are going to put 20 into resto you need the 1 more pt to get NS.  It SAVES you.<br />
<br />
If you want pure DPS, than 14/32/5 will be the way to go.  Natural weapons adds to damage and natural shapeshifter reduces shifting costs ( mana ) .  Love it, it's awesome.  <br />
<br />
I am contemplating going 0/30/21 again for the ability just to heal my way out of everything.  So torn *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railand</div><div class="date">06-20-2006, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestions. The suggested balance build is tempting. Where would you suggest taking a point away from in the feral side to get NS?  I thought about my own time spent (mostly questing and grinding, instance healing) and figured I could afford to hold off on Leader of the Pack.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your comments and pointing out NS.  I completely missed that.</div></div><hr />

Basically trading 3% increase in crit for an instant nature spell every 3 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railand</div><div class="date">06-21-2006, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, but IIRC, that's a 3% increase for party members only or does it also apply to self?</div></div><hr />
