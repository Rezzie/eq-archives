Good times, because it's a group effort, and different from the usual day to day grind.<br />
<br />
My point is, I have practically NO experience at solo PvP'ing.  I just don't grind around looking to attack hordies, and very rarely raid anything.<br />
<br />
I am currently residing in Silithus, having just come out of the Eastern Plaguelands, and my Quest log is full of RED dungeon and PvP quests.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I understand the dungeon quests, but PvP quests are new to me.  If I successfully complete a PvP quest, does that somehow benefit my side of the faction?</div></div><hr />

PvP quest just mean you have to be &quot;flagged for PvP&quot; in order to complete the quest.  This isn't an issue on PvP servers since everyone is flagged.  But on PvE servers you have to manually flag yourself in order to complete the quest (collect items, turn-in the quest and/or &quot;take control&quot; of a flag stations, etc.).<br />
<br />
In many cases, when you complete a zone's PvP quest, your faction will see a benefit.  Typically in the form of x% DPS increase, or some other buff.<br />

Here's a description of the Silithus PvP quest...<br />

BTW, in the Outlands, many (all?) zones have some sort of World PvP quest that has a similar affect (boost your DPS, etc.)</div></div><hr />

Thanks mostly to the members of this site, I learn something new every day about Warcraft.  It's magnitude blows me away.</div></div><hr />
