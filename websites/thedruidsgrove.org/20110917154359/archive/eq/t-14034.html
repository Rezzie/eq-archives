This is old content, search the web for it.  If you have specfic questions on certain mobs, I recommend..<br />
<br />
A:  Your raid actually attempt the mob this is very old content is mostly trival with todays gear if you understand basic raiding theory.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B:  State which mob in perticular you are having issues with, what force your typically fielding and what exact issue you think to be the problem.<br />
<br />
Example, We're doing Rathe, We don't field 13+ clerics and our healing on the tank mezzing mobs seems to be our biggest issue, is there a better why to heal for this portion of the event, because we're currently doing it like X.<br />
 <br />
Anyone know any links to any alternate quest would be helpful too.<br />
<br />
Search for it - start with Allas.</div></div><hr />
