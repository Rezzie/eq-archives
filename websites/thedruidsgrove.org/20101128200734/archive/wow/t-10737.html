<br />
So I released spirit, and wisped back to the arena.  But it would not let me reclaim my body, so I'm stuck as a wisp, hovering over my corpse.<br />
<br />
I'm not going back to the angel and rez, as that will cost me a fair penny to repair all the equipment.<br />
<br />
First time this has ever happened to me, what do I do?  I see dead people!!</div></div><hr />

When I logged out, my character list shows me as &quot;Ghost&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Log out. Log back in. Run to your dead body and hit resurrect.<br />
<br />
2. Type &quot;/console reloadui&quot; without the &quot; &quot; and it will reload your UI and you will be able to see your corpse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  I wisped to my dead body.  There was no pop-up window that allowed me to hit resurrect.  That is the problem.<br />
<br />
2.  I can see my corpse just fine, my wisp is hovering over it. :)</div></div><hr />

I just logged out and back in again and was able to ressurect right where I died. Worst case rez at the spirit, cost of repair sure beats sitting around waiting for a GM or something magical to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">06-22-2006, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest logging off and clearing your ghost character from the server by logging on to a different character for 60 seconds or so.  When you log back on to your ghost character, the server shuold have reset things.  If you still can't do it and your not wanting to pay the money for a spirit rez, I'd log a ticket.  Although, thats a lot of trouble.  I'd log a ticket for a repair cost refund in that case.</div></div><hr />
