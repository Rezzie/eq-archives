<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pulvani</div><div class="date">05-25-2005, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious as to whether or not this effects heals, namely our blast heals (I know it doesn't affect our pseudo-CH). I'm trying to put together a wish list, and I would really like worn beneficial haste on an item. I believe that the spell version (blessing of duration/aura of duration and the like) decrease our blast heal spell times. Do the worn spell hastes decrease those times as well? I *think* they do, just wanted some verification.<br />
<br />
The reason I was confused is because Lucy says (Percentage heal excluded) for things like blessing of duration and quickening of mithaniel. Does that mean our CH only? Or does it affect the blast heals as well?<br />
<br />
Sorry if this post is a little unclear...brain took a break after work was done at 5:00  :grin:</div></div><hr />

It works nicely on our nukes and our blast heals, but does nothing for karana's renewal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">05-25-2005, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either generic spell haste (&quot;Spell Haste V&quot; or &quot;Quickening of Druzzil&quot;) or beneficial spell haste (&quot;Hastening/Alacrity/Quickening of the Ikaav&quot; or &quot;Haste/Speed/Quickening of Mithaniel&quot;) will affect blast heals.  Buff-only beneficial spell haste (&quot;Enhancement Haste V&quot;) will NOT affect heals.<br />
<br />
The best haste for heals is Quickening of Mithaniel (30% to level 67) or Quickening of the Ikaav (30% to level 70).  It's 7% faster than the all-purpose Quickening of Druzzil.</div></div><hr />

I was looking at Quickening of Mithaniel and planning on saving up my raid points, lol. Currently I use blessing of devotion from a kind cleric on the raid plus my own tributed spell haste (which is like worn spell haste). I'd basically like to get rid of the tribute. Thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it will interest you but take a look at this (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showpost.php?p=162633&amp;postcount=38)  post by Kaidman. He lists off a whole bunch of worn beneficial spell haste items. Some might make you drool ( or at least it had that affect on me ) while others are quite obtainable.</div></div><hr />

I'd highly recommend trying to get &quot;Loop of Entropic Hues&quot; from north zun (non-splitter).  This ear would last you well past OOW/DON gearing too.  30% beneficial haste, good hp/mana, and improved dodge 3 mod.</div></div><hr />
