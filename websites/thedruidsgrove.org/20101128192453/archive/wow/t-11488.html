You can get mapnotes without the rest of cosmos.  It provides a slash command to put a note on your map for coords called /tloc<br />
<br />
/tloc 45,60 would put a dot at 45,60<br />
<br />
As stated above CT's mapmod will show you coords when you are in your world map.  It shows you both where your cursor is at and where you are at.<br />
<br />
Titan has a location mod which shows you coords on your titan bar.<br />
<br />
I use a combination of titan and ct.  Back when I was using cosmos, I really liked tloc.  I'm considering installing mapnotes for it.<br />
<br />
I have not tried metamap yet.<br />
<br />
My guildies call me the king of mods.  I have mods to do everything... and it also takes me like 30s longer to log in than my wife =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
how do you do that? i searched for this function but couldn't get it to work...<br />
<br />
can you explain plz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apep</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For starters u need a note on the map, if you have none you can make one by holding ctrl and leftclikcing on the map where u want the note (usually at a exact location using coordinates from sites like thottbot or wowhead). Type a name for the note, i just use the coordinate xx,yy.<br />
When u have saved the note a dot appears on ur world map, u can have insane amounts of notes so no need to delete an old one unless its getting clutterish ^^<br />
Now u can rightclick on the mapnote, and choose &quot;Set as waypoint&quot;. Close the world map.<br />
Now u should have a arrow on ur screen, probably in the middle on top of ur char, u can move it by rightclick-hold and drag. It tells u the direction which u should be running and how far it is, but bare in mind, it shows the EXACT direction, not the easiest way there around mountains and such. So u still need to use ur brain and map a little ^^<br />
But it sure helps a lot on finding quest items and such.<br />
<br />
Hope this was of help =)</div></div><hr />
