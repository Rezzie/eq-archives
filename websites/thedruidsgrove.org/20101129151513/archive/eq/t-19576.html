 March 16 (Bloomberg) -- Talk-radio king Rush Limbaugh’s model health-care system may be one of Latin America’s longest- standing state-run programs, where 98 percent of the population is covered and private insurance is rare.<br />
<br />
Limbaugh, whose show is heard on about 600 stations, told his listeners on March 8 that if Democratic-backed health legislation became U.S. law he’d go to Costa Rica. A 2008 American Journal of Public Health study found the Central American nation’s health coverage “excellent,” with life expectancy second only to Canada in the Western Hemisphere.<br />
<br />
Jean-Pierre Unger, the author of the study, said it was “paradoxical” for a radio host who often warns of the dangers of government involvement in health care to praise Costa Rica.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps Rush Limbaugh is not aware of the very nature of this system,” said Unger, a researcher at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium.<br />
<br />
During his program, Limbaugh, 59, said: “If this passes, and it’s five years from now and all that stuff gets implemented -- I am leaving the country. I’ll go to Costa Rica.”</div></div><hr />

That, or capitalism at its finest. Why risk paying for something when you can steal it from somebody else?<br />
