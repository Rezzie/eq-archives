<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakiniku</div><div class="date">08-30-2006, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, my guild is looking for good druids to assist in our raids, particularly for Naxx progression.  I'm taking the initiative to help &quot;recruit&quot; new druids.  Currently, our server lacks dedicated and decently geared druids.  <br />
<br />
We have I'd say 3 active druids in our guild.  I'm one of them.  Unfortunately I work for corporate America and have to go to work in the mornings (BOOOOO!!).  :bs: As a result, I can't stay in raid as late as I would like (we usually raid until 1:00 to 1:30ish).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if you're on SH, or thinking of transferring, please look my guild up and put in an application. <br />
<br />
And with that I'll list some of the things we will be looking for:<br />
<br />
1) Availability - we raid Mon-Thurs from 9:30 to 1:00 (and later).  Being ready to raid at 9:30, outside of the instance is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
2) Spec - we don't force a particular spec.  However, as a druid, you will be healing 95% of the time.  I was feral at one point but switched to resto for Naxx in order to be more useful.<br />
<br />
3) Gear - At least T1 would be preferred (or ZG/AQ20 gear).  Not a necessity though.  Btw, I have great feral gear too b/c of the lack of druids.  Check out my ctprofiles.  Our main druid is also 8/8 and has better feral gear than me.<br />
<br />
4) Personality - if you're not an @$$hole, you'll be fine.  We had a recruit not too long ago that got kicked for taking an AQ20 rejuv book (even though he knew it already) and faked learning it by using an Argent Dawn token.  We don't like people doing crappy things like that with our guild tag on.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, if you want more info, you can also pm me.  Thanks for reading this mess of a post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're looking to transfer to a PvP server and looking for a guild, please consider Shattered Hand and place a application (if you're serious) on our guild website(http://www.deathdealers.org).  <br />
<br />
Again, we're not a hardcore raiding guild, but we manage to progress at a decent pace (5 Naxx bosses on farm).  Hope to hear from you soon.</div></div><hr />
