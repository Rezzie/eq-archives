Included is the druid epic flight form, the Black Temple, nether drake mounts, and more quests in the Ethereum Prison, Skettis, and Ogri'la.<br />

Read on for the text of the Under Development page...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">04-10-2007, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Black Temple<br />
<br />
Originally founded as a Draenei temple, this plot has been conquered and despoiled many times throughout the history of Outland, removing any spiritual grace it may have once held. The Black Temple has been the stage of the Orc Horde's blood curse, a fortress for the then-mortal Ner'zhul, and a prime staging ground for the Burning Legion's campaign of destruction.. Most recently, it has been claimed as home by Illidan, where he and his minions make their bid for power over the remnants of the shattered planet. Now, it is up to you to face the malefic forces of Illidan and his minions in hopes of freeing Outland from chaos and tyranny.<br />
<br />
Black Temple is a 25-person raid dungeon located in Shadowmoon Valley.<br />
<br />
 * Explore an ancient site steeped in Warcraft lore<br />
 * Gain access to more than a hundred new rare and epic items, including tier-6 armor sets<br />
 * Choose your path through a nonlinear level-70 raid dungeon, as you make your way to...<br />
 * Face Illidan himself!<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2.1.0 patch and the opening of the now defiled Black Temple, home of Illidan and his minions has long been known. However, the patch is also introducing a great deal of new solo and 5-person content as well, with new rewards, factions, and items. As we're approaching the release of the patch we wanted to share a glimpse into some of the upcoming content that hadn't yet been confirmed for this next patch, or hadn't even been known of until now.<br />
<br />
Druid Epic Flight Form<br />
<br />
      The Druid Epic flight form will be available through a series of quests, similar to the Warlock and Paladin Epic mount quests before it. This quest series will also open up a new boss in Sethekk Halls, and ultimately to the epic flight form. <br />
<br />
Ethereum Prison<br />
<br />
      Players in good standing with the Consortium will be tasked to deal with the most recent activities of the nefarious Ethereum. With new quests, items, and content for the solo and small-group level 70 player, the Ethereum Prison will be the proving grounds for many aspiring to greatness.<br />
<br />
Skettis<br />
<br />
      The Skyguard, Sha'tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above Shattrath, have taken the offensive directly to the Arakkoa capital city, Skettis. Perched high in the mountains of Terrokar, and only accessible with use of a flying mount, Skettis holds new and exciting content for the solo or small-group level 70 player. All new quests, 5-person bosses, rare and epic items, and a new type of flying mount await those willing to lend their sword or stave to the battle. <br />
<br />
Nether Drake<br />
<br />
      The Netherwing faction and quest line continues and the long awaited Nether Drake becomes available. The Nether Drake is a special 280% speed epic flying mount that is obtainable through solo and small-group play. The quest to obtain one will be difficult, but the reward will surely show your dedication to the Netherwing cause as you soar through the skies of Outland on your very own ethereal drake. <br />
<br />
Ogri'la<br />
<br />
      The Ogre plateau of enlightenment opens to those who prove their worth in Blade's Edge Mountains. Level 70 players will be able to help the Ogres of Ogri'la battle invading forces and engage in new and exciting quests, such as a repeatable and ever popular bombing-run, this time using your own flying mount but with a dangerous twist! Featuring tons of new quests, the Ogri'la faction, 5-person bosses, and rare and epic items, Ogri'la is a place we're hoping all will aspire to enter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO, if its pricey, ie more then 200g Ill just buy the regular mount. If its not so bad I'll just hold out and get teh flight form.<br />
<br />
Eventually though I'm sure I'll end up getting both just to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-10-2007, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since it has been said that we need the epic training anyways ( 5K ) I can't see them making it too much more costly than the price of the mount.  Though the whole instant cast epic speed &lt;3.<br />
<br />
I just got my epic flying mount and the speed is almost absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-10-2007, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And lets not forget the profession changes that are forthcoming in the same patch:<br />
<br />
Alchemy <br />
<br />
<br />
 Elixirs now stack in two categories, Battle (Offensive) and Guardian (Defensive) Elixirs. You can only have one of each type of Elixir up at a time. As a result Elixirs now stack with class abilities such as &quot;Arcane Intellect.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Four new defensive elixirs have been added. Two are on trainers, one is in Halaa and one is in Cenarion Expedition. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Flask of Petrification&quot; can no longer be turned off during its duration, but it now will clear all threat from all monsters for the duration of the effect. Though monsters may reaquire you after the effect ends. <br />
<br />
 The cost to purchase Imbued Vials has been reduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanting <br />
<br />
<br />
 Enchant Bracer-Spellpower had its primal costs reduced slightly. <br />
<br />
 Enchanting recipes that increase spell damage now also increase healing as well. <br />
<br />
 The &quot;Major Defense Bracer&quot; enchantment has been moved from Ethereum Researchers to Ethereum Nullifiers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Engineering <br />
<br />
<br />
 A recipe for &quot;Frost Grenades&quot; and the &quot;Icy Blasting Primers&quot; needed to make them are now on engineering trainers. <br />
<br />
 Engineering recipes can now be placed in engineering bags, as can engineer made fireworks. <br />
<br />
 Many engineering recipes will now give skillups for longer than the previously did. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Seaforium&quot; now opens locked chests as well as locked doors <br />
<br />
 The Poultryizer and Nigh Invulnerability Belt now cause mishaps less often. <br />
<br />
 The Goblin Rocket Launcher cooldown has been reduced significantly. <br />
<br />
 11 new epic goggles have been introduced at 350 engineering skill and are available from the trainer. They range from cloth to plate, and have a variety of stats to appeal to most talent specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fishing <br />
<br />
<br />
 The fishing timer has been reduced from 30 to 20 seconds and it now takes less time to fish. <br />
<br />
 The fishing timer can no longer run through its duration without a fish biting. <br />
<br />
 Fishing has been removed from Arathi Basin and Alterac Valley. <br />
<br />
 You can now fish in Underbog.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting <br />
<br />
<br />
 The jewelcrafting UI now has gems split up by color so it is easier to find gems of a specific color to create. <br />
<br />
 A number new gem cuts to existing gems have been added to the game. Included among them are a spell hit gem and more multi-stat gems that have attack power on them. <br />
<br />
 Jewelcrafters can make two new melee oriented meta gems. One is found randomly as a world drop and the other sold by the &lt;Faction&gt; reputation vendor. <br />
<br />
 Thorium requirements for most recipes has been reduced. <br />
<br />
 Prospecting now always yields at least 1 gem. Overall, the amount of gems received from prospecting has been increased. <br />
<br />
 New recipes have been added that use the Jaggal and Shadow Pearls.<br />
<br />
<br />
Leatherworking <br />
<br />
<br />
 Skinning higher level creatures will give more leather; you will no longer get a single leather scrap. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Knothide Armor&quot; kits now require less leather to make and give skill increases for longer. <br />
<br />
 Leatherworking made primalstrike set now has an attack power set bonus rather than a strength set bonus.<br />
<br />

<br />
and I'm still a bit skeptical as to how the alchemy changes will add up (still haven't gotten around to leveling up alchemy...saving money ;D)</div></div><hr />
