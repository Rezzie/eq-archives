Most stuff in The Hive however, does not.  May try the yellow cons on the Living Bridges.</div></div><hr />

Do you have skin of the reptile and spore spiral?  If so I'm sure you could solo here with the proper buffs.  The summon timer on the Gargs by ent (there's 2 of em, quick repop) is ~6 seconds, just root / snare them, hand corona them, than dot til you get summoned.  Than back out of melee range (quickly) and DoT or heal.  You'll definaly need BoD for this, I'ld recommend near full hp buffs as well.  If you don't have good gear i'ld bring HOT potions too, and of course DS pots could help too.  I solo`d these (usually tanking) for awhile and never dropped under 40% hp.  Tanking would usually take 1:30 / 40% mana per mob and root/dot/running would take 2-3 minutes and 20-30% mana per mob.<br />

Just a reminder, the aug is now 70 / 70, not 120 / 120.</div></div><hr />
