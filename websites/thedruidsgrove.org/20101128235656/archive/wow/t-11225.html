<br />
Wanted to ask, is the Gen set good for feral?<br />
And will that +150 armor for having 3-peices of the Gen. gear transfer to bear form so I would get around 700 (not sure how much you get) more armor?<br />
I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it to get that set, I have the rep for it.<br />
I will post on this thread later today what I have for gear, I know people have ask how I have so much armor, right now I'm at 14,2xx to 14,4xx and working on the smoking heart trinket still, have to get that.<br />
<br />
Please let me know!<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the help:) <br />

<br />
I know I would give my eye teeth for it, but will be some time for me to get my guild to clearing AQ40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alphyratz</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're pure feral (IE, spend all your time in cat/bear, and do little-no healing), and you're in a guild capable of getting Genesis gear, then not at all, theres a LOT of much better feral gear in AQ40. If you play as a hybrid, though, then its harder- I'd personally say its still not worth it, as I'd just carry around two sets of gear (caster and feral), but if you pvp a lot, then having two sets of gear doesnt work as well. So I guess it all really depends on what you spend most of your time doing :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unendlich</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a feral dps/tank druid and I was dueling with a resto with I think like 11 points feral for the charge. He had mainly tier 2.5 and end of dreams. I was very impressed at his mitigation,mana, and actual AP. Hybrid gear is the way to go for PvP. So if you can't get field marshall then get this set if your really into PvP atm. Of course expansions is here in a couple months so who knows.</div></div><hr />
