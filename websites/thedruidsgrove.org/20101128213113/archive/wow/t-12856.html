<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">09-27-2008, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just started tonight.  Really tough to adjust to having zero addons, especially any kind of damage meter.  Hard to measure accurately with no numbers!  I'm playing 0/56/5 kitty spec.  Here (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZEGMsfrz0eo0IzAo0x)<br />
<br />
Killed some mobs in a few zones and did an AB.  My observations so far:<br />
<br />
There has been a damage increase with the new talents.  Not huge; the clouds didn't part with angel song and a sunbeam, but noticeable.  Fully talented FB crits are fun, and Rake is now very useful to put a bleed on an oponent from the front side to take advantage of the FB boosting talents.  In AB I certainly didn't WTFBBQPWN anyone, but I didn't feel completely outclassed 1v1 like I do on live.  Also, kitty form when in front of an opponent is much more than Mangle spam like it is on live.<br />
<br />
I didn't play very long tonight, so I'll learn more with more time in the game.  So far the only disappointment is that we don't have any gee whiz new abilities, just improved versions of old stuff.  Shamen have a new pushback ability (don't know what it's called yet) that a guy was using to punt allies off the cliff at the Lumber Mill.  Pretty funny.<br />
<br />
Would love to hear impressions from anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For kitty you should get OoC, it has the highest DPS per talent point in any of our trees.  Blizzard increased the proc rate and it is affected by haste.  Unless you are a pure bear, you want OoC.<br />
<br />
And KotJ.  That just rocks!</div></div><hr />

I play on a PvP server on live where ganking is a regular part of life so PvP performance matters to me.</div></div><hr />

I'm kinda conflicted; I want to go back to Resto (I like the healing thing) but I figure feral will still be easier for leveling with...<br />
<br />
Course, I leveled 10-60 resto, so it can't be THAT bad, right? :P</div></div><hr />
