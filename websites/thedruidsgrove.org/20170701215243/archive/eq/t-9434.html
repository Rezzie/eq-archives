Mobs that don't summon would be a big bonus ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the question, I was told when I first got access that soloing is near impossible as everything summons (cept Fire). And if there was something, it wasnt worth it. Only place I cant confirm that is in PoWater....im sure someone has more experience testing soloing in EP more then myself - I just always had guild groups.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

You just have to be able to do it.  I posted a sorta guide for it ages ago on here somewhere.</div></div><hr />

I hate soloing in water, and only do it, if I feel the need to die 1 or 2 times a night.<br />

Fire or Tactics is where I get most my exp.<br />

<br />
Groups by the zone in are pretty common - ask one of em if you can grab a DC Dillo on their next pull.  Once you have one, buff it with your normal slew of buffs and the savage spirit.  Chain CH on the thing, I can take on most non-named critters near the zone in one at a time with the pet tanking.<br />
<br />
the exp's not as good with the pet, but it's cool to say that &quot;Yeah, I can solo in Earth, too.&quot;<br />

I am interested in Vxed but too big of a chicken to do that just yet. My guild has been in Fire recently and I've been paying close attention!  :evilgrin: I know that mobs don't summon in Fire (afaik; the nameds probably do, but I will NOT be soloing those obviously), and there's a low mob aggro radius. Where do you guys suggest I try soloing? I could do tables but that is commonly camped. What about right at the zone in? And how are their resists (for snaring/rooting purposes)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info! I'll post here as to what happened when I tried it out.</div></div><hr />

You can pull quads from gib with some practice if the tables are taken.  You can also just ask the tables group if they mind you sharing some spawns (they won't) and kite them on the Fennin ramp.  When you do that, tell teh tables group you are interested in a spot if they have one - you'll get much better XP in a caster group there than soloing.  Also, anywhere inside Castle 2 is fine if you are careful on your pathing while kiting/rotting.  <br />
<br />
Thing is atm, what used to be an empty zone except for us casters, is now the place to level up for OOW.  So don't expect Fire to be empty these days.</div></div><hr />

I knew it was but for some reason I forgot ;) I also didn't realize how agonizingly slow it would be to solo one of these since they resist my fire dots...back to grouping =\</div></div><hr />

Our AoE spell was the best for quadding there, and our cold nuke is the icing on the cake.   Just put on the two swarm dots, then nuke, nuke, nuke.  Mobs go down quickly enough for me.   Or set up a quad, if you have the mana for it.   <br />

I truly hope no one is trying to cast a fire dot on anything in this zone.</div></div><hr />

No need to wait for tank/cleric/slower (they all in WoS &amp; PG anyway heh) - just group up with whomever (generally druids, wizards, mages, necros, chanters) and have at it aggro kiting.   I was in a group with myself, bard, chanter, and 3 mages and the mobs died really fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There arent animals in most zones these days...at least tagged as such!<br />
<br />
We normally solo at a spot in the second castle, known as &quot;tables.&quot; Its literally a picnic like area with 8-10 nearby mobs to pull and kite around. Lots of room, and depending on the group, nearly endless pulls. The mobs themselves are the humonoid Doomfire models - guards. <br />
<br />
Due to the lack of decent animal-tagged NPCs a lot of us gave up high end charm killing after PoS frogs...those were the days.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait till I graduate from PoN and try the froggies in PoStorms... I heard they practically kill themselves  ... like...  :bonk:  or  :box: <br />

I usually chain quad kite around the tables with other druids or casters who feel daring enough.  This exp is great especially if you're fortunate enought to have a wizzie or necro.  On my server most group DO mind you pulling a couple of solo mobs, even if you don't bother them and go up the ramp.  It's just too much of a risk to them I suppose.  For soloing use your Eci's and Cold nukes.  Not Fire nukes.  I also use my BoT and all magic dots.  I know the cold nuke thing seems simple to some of us... but if you don't know, you just don't know...  :)</div></div><hr />
