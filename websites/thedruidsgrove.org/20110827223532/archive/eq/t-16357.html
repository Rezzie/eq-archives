<br />
With that said, I am looking for a list of inconsistencies with our spells and AA.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Call of the Wild Fails<br />
Exodus can not be used in Plane of Fear<br />
Nature's Guardian does not work in Plane of Sky<br />
<br />
And so forth.<br />
<br />
I'll also take issues such as:<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Wild range should be increased to match that of our in combat DS spells (Barkspur, Fernspur, etc).<br />
<br />
I'll be submitting this list to the Dev team on 12/1/07<br />

<br />
In my experience, Vinelash Cascade does absolutely nothing 7/10 times.<br />
<br />
Normally, when casting a detrimental spell on a mob (let's use root as an example), you will receive a message in the chat window. Something along the lines of, &quot;mob_04 is grasped by deadly roots of death.&quot; Let's assume that root sticks. The mob is stuck, but turns and faces your direction. Even without the text message, you know that you have aggro. Following? Good.<br />
<br />
When casting Vinelash Cascade on roaming or stationary mobs (I discovered this with both Kedge in Thalassius missions and the mining goblins in Sunderock), well...most of the time, nothing happens. At the least, you should receive a message saying that your spell had did not take hold on its target. Nothing. Roaming mobs walk right by as though you had done nothing at all. The goblins still have their backs turned to you and keep on mining. <br />
<br />
A couple of GMs on Tribunal (who will not be named) claimed to have created a copy of my character and tested the spell with no problems. The spell may have worked once for them and they saw nothing wrong. Try it multiple times. Sometimes it works. Most of the time...it just eats my mana, and nothing good comes of it. Much like trying to keep up heals on a ranger when your raid's tanks have all bit the dust.<br />
<br />
There is an obvious intermittent issue with this spell. It's so inconsistent (OK, let's just call it broken) that it cannot be used. <br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this, or would like to confirm?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
iirc 15 feet to eitehr side of you, and a range less then that of our nukes.<br />
<br />
If the mobs are not in that box the spell will not hit them.<br />

The range is semi limited, and it only works RIGHT in front of you, not off to the sides at all. If a mob is roaming and you cast where it is and not at where it is about to be it will not hit. What you have targeted has absolutely nothing to do with what this spell hits. Personally I have never had a problem with it, and I use it all the time.</div></div><hr />

Many of us do not bother to read the SOE forums on a weekly basis. I wish that this information had been explicitly included in the spell's description. Allakhazam lists it as having an AE radius of 15...is this the correct stat? I'm not sure where else I should be looking.<br />
<br />
For comparision, Cloudburst Hail has an AE radius of 20, and I have never had any LoS issues with it. I'll give it another try in-game. Thanks for the quick response.<br />

The Orange Gemmed spells are Rains, which still require LoS, but have a range then the radius is a circle around the point of landing.<br />

Play WoW and you'll see just how ridiculous it can get.  You can literally be standing next to someone with a board in the way and a HEAL won't land.  Plus, most detrimental spells have a directional facing requirement as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">11-15-2007, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just pasting my Druid Feedback list from my Wiki.  I haven't even read the posts here so please forgive me if I'm repeating what was already posted:<br />
<br />
AAs<br />
<br />
* Druids should have an AA which allows them to sort and filter tracking results, like rangers can.<br />
<br />
Spells<br />
<br />
* A great many mobs use AEs that knock off the druid Mask spells. This should be changed, there is no reason for them to remove your Mask spell.<br />
<br />
(Note:  You are aware of this and you posted they claim to be looking into fixing this)<br />
<br />
* The druid spell Lunar Light should be restored to its prenerf beta ability.<br />
<br />
(Note:  This is under discussion along with the other group heal spells)<br />
<br />
* The druid skin spells and eagle spells do not allow the single versions to overwrite the group versions. These are the only spells in the game with that problem. There is no apparent reason for the skin spells to have this problem. Flight of Eagles is slightly faster than Spirit of Eagle, which might cause this problem. To solve it, just bump up the speed of Spirit of Eagle to match.<br />
<br />
(Note:  Also mentioned in the Code requests thread)<br />
<br />
* Druids should get a zephyr (translocate) spell for every place they can port.<br />
* Druid curing is behind both the two other Priest classes and the abilities of hybrids. Druid curing needs improvement.<br />
<br />
Wolf Form<br />
<br />
* The wolf form attack animation should be changed or removed. People decline to become wolves because the animation makes them queasy.<br />
* Wolf form spells should be adjusted to be useful. People decline to become wolves because the benefits are almost non existent.<br />
* Every wolf form spell should work both indoors and outdoors. LDoN gave us a few new wolf spells that work indoors. However, adding even more spells with different effects just makes it more confusing and difficult. The LDoN wolf form spells should be removed from the game, the adventure points refunded and all wolf from spells should work both indoors and outdoors.<br />
* Wolf form spells should overwrite the Mask spells. Unless the number of buff slots is increased for players, the wolf form spell of the correct level should have the same effects as the Mask spell, add the extra effects (such as movement increase), and replace it in the buff box. This would entail creating new wolf form spells to match the Mask spells. The only reason the Mask spells were created in the first place was to replace wolf form when it was badly nerfed. I think Mask spells should remain in the game but if you use the same level wolf spell, it should overwrite it with the same effects plus the wolf form extra effects.<br />
* Wolf form should remain upon players after zoning. Since the wolf graphic is now in the global file, there is no need to strip it from players when zoning because you can now (in theory) be a wolf in every zone.</div></div><hr />

Heal spells have never required LoS in EQ (thank goodness), so yes, that is much better than Wow, but isn't really part of the LoS topic or issues.</div></div><hr />

I can check into this, but I am pretty sure this does this per our request, so that we can overwrite the Root with a longer duration one like Savage Roots.<br />

 <br />
if you read my post that was not my issue at all. heres my original post <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I would like to see a code change to the stacking issues of spore spiral that prevents it from overwriting a standard junky root cast by other classes. I dont think this is a balance issue, After all, the ranger skylance root will overwrite a standard root and can in turn be overwrote..so i think this is a reasonable request for ours to be the same way. <br />
 <br />
my issue was changing the spell so that it functions EXACTLY as every other single root in the game since its creation..it can overwrite a spell AND in turn be overwrote..the ranger spell already does that, they can root a mob with eldarr grasp and then re-root with a standard root and they have no blocking issues at all. is there a reason duids are being punished with faulty game code that says any class can permanently block our root forever with a low lvl one? i didnt ask for spore spiral to block other roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">11-19-2007, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has to do with the Duration of the Root I believe.  The Reason Rangers can overwrite Elddar's with their normal Root is they are both 1 minute durations, thus interchangeable.</div></div><hr />

That sounds like a bug, unless he's higher level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">11-19-2007, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just confirmed. went to the lowest, weakest place i could find to lower the chance of a random break, qeynos hills. my lvl 75 ranger friend was online..i ported him and my 76 druid to surefall and zoned..targed a field rat, cast mire thorns and then savage roots.<br />
 <br />
  he cast eldarr grasp and it overwrote mine. we tested this 10 times...it happened 10 out of 10.<br />
 <br />
  we checked the resist mod, and both are chromatic resist, ranger version at -30 and dru at -50, but he says he might see one resist in 100 if even that, even in hi end zones, so that isnt really an issue.<br />
 <br />
   rangers have a better root than druids because it can overwrite a standard root and can in turn have their root overwrote, and i do not think this was intended.<br />
 <br />
  thats why i posted the request that our root stacking issues be brought in line to reflect druids spells should be baseline for rangers, not vice versa</div></div><hr />

Ive always thought the spell was supposed to function as the ranger one does, and that it was some sort of code flaw that it didn't, because it didnt make sense that rangers/druids, who basically have the same root, do not function the same.<br />
 <br />
  If prathun or the dev's say its that way on purpose by design, then ill drop my request, as in my opinion i love this spell very much and as i said before i can simply ask ppl in grp don't root and they usually listen.</div></div><hr />
