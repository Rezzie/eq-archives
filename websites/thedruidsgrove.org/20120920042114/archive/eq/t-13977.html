 <br />
I am hoping you guys can help me out regarding a couple of our AA's skills.<br />
 <br />
1) Convergence of Spirits<br />
 <br />
I normally save this for an emergency when the tank needs a fast heal but I am wondering if anyone knows how it affects the tanks ability to keep agro. I mean the description says that it &quot;leaves the target with protective thorns&quot;. Does that mean that it will reduce the tanks agro? (and head to you!)<br />
 <br />
2) Wrath of the Wild<br />
 <br />
When I first got this ability I simply used it on the tank as a way of adding an extra bit of dps to the group. I now cast it on the puller just after the tank engages the mob. I have found that this helps take agro from the puller. Is that the way most people use this AA or are there other strategies that you guys use?<br />
 <br />
As always your opinions are most welcome.....</div></div><hr />

I either use it for extra DPS in groups or when I solo then I let myself take a hit.  I usually use it to finish off mobs when I solo, usually in Vxed.<br />
<br />
As far as I know the dmg shields doesn't have any agro, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to use CoS as either a quick direct heal on a secondary group member, me after I cast Oaken Guard, or on the MA after a Direct Heal.<br />
<br />
When used on the MA, you can cast SI, CoS, and then SI again and you pick up an extra 2k direct in healing and 3k in HoT.<br />

Using it very early in a fight could pull agro, though I've never noticed it.<br />
 <br />
Wrath definately shouldn't make any changes to a group's agro.  If anything you might generate a tiny bit of agro yourself if you cast it midfight due to the 1 pt rune.<br />
 <br />
I think our only direct agro mod-spell is Oaken Guard which can lower your hate on mobs swinging at you.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
But otherwise I save it for emergency heals,  like my healing hammer and mask.</div></div><hr />
