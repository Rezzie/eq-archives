Since we get a free respec as of 2.0.3 (today) I'm thinking of the following build....please comment.<br />

Personally the only part that I'm debating with myself is the single point in Living Spirit, I'm wondering if it would be better spent in Furor for when I solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">01-09-2007, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure I like that build very much. You're taking Resto up to Tree of Life, but then not taking the Improved Rejuvenation Talent.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of Subtlety, and I'd move those points to Naturalist for the 10% dps increase and faster big heals. <br />
<br />
I'd also take Omen of Clarity - why not for 1 point.<br />
<br />
If you're focussing on healing primarily, I would leave out Furor and Natural Shapeshifter, and pick up Improved Rejuv.<br />
<br />
I'd grab Nature's Grasp because it's awesome for 1 point.<br />
<br />
I changed your build to this (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?0100000000000000000005030000000000000  00000050550301531500011051) and still have one point left over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beorn</div><div class="date">01-09-2007, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm I guess I can agree with ditching Subtlety (I just figured threat reduction while healing was always a good thing)<br />
<br />
If Nature's Grasp was passive I'd go for it but since I have to cast it and there's not a convenient place on my bar I'll never remember to use it.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of Naturalist but I think it sacrifices some of my soloability at 60 (Furor/Subtlety), maybe I'll start putting points in it as I level 60-70.<br />
<br />
I completely agree with Imp Rejuv. <br />
<br />
Do you have any idea (from experience) how often Omen procs?<br />
<br />
Edit: I just found this bit on wowwiki:<br />
Omen of Clarity: (Tier 3 Restoration) Omen of Clarity gets the most mileage out of feral forms, since your DPS comes from melee damage to begin with. Restoration and Balance druids may find this talent next to useless, since their primary roles (nuking and healing) never cause Omen of Clarity to proc. http://www.wowwiki.com/Druid_tactics<br />
Which makes me think it's a point I could use elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Do you think the single point in Living Spirit is worth it?<br />
<br />
Maybe something more like this:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?0000000000000000000005030000000000000  00000052053331531500001051<br />
(Depending if Omen is worth it or not.....if it's really not then I'll put an additional point in Furor since Furor really helps when I'm soloing....shift lots to heal self.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">01-09-2007, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience with OOC is from feral (pre 2.0) and it was very nice. I can see how it may be less useful for a resto, but have no direct experience. If you're soloing in feral, it will proc a lot for free dps moves or shift/heal.<br />
<br />
Your mileage from subtlety will depend on the quality of your tank, but just yell at them (or refuse to heal) a few times and I'm sure they'll shape up :) <br />
<br />
How about this (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MzZxbGs0bZVEczcq0ho) for a heavy healing focus with some good feral dps talents for soloing?<br />
<br />
If you're going to go all the way to Tree of Life (which will improve your healing ability at the expense of your soloing), then Living Spirit is probably a good choice for talent points. You increase your mana regen and also increase the +healing benefit of the Tree of Life form, which is based off your spirit.<br />
<br />
Something like this (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zzZx0bZVEczcq0eot).<br />
<br />
Nature's Grasp is worth it if you PVP. If not, you can skip it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much the kind of build I'll go for when I respec for healing again.  Tree of Life is nice, but with the aura change it makes me like it a bit less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just backwards.  Naturalist and OoC help soloability.  10% increased damage and free attacks = faster kills.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Naturalist will make you a better instance healer cause HT will take less time to cast.<br />
<br />
Subtlety is a waste, especially if you have Natures Focus, which is an incredibly important talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vhailor</div><div class="date">01-09-2007, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well being a full resto druid (until today's respec) with some cat dps gear to solo, OOC was proc'ing alot. <br />
<br />
out of interest are there many people using the 0/30/21 build and how do you find it? With the free respec i was thinking of making a build like that to use till lvl 70. Does anyone feel gimped because neither tree is complete.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone thinking of maybe a 0/30/31 build or 0/31/30 build once reaching 70?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-10-2007, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using a 30/21 build pre-patch (2.0.3), and I still haven't respeccd again.  Before 2.0 I was 0/15/36<br />
<br />
I love the build, always have.  Natures Swiftness is an incredible talent, and with Heart of the Wild, I can heal, dps and tank well, and have incredible survivability.  Having Naturalist and OoC = a lot more dps now.  And the fact that Blood frenzy and Primal fury are combined are even more dps.  With Reflection (15% mana regen and 10 rage when Enrage), I have even better mana regen when healing, and I can shift to bear and automatically have 20 rage for a charge / swipe / demo shout combo.  I would consider going 1/29/21 though for rank 1 NG.  Overall, its still truly an all around jack of all trades build.<br />
<br />
I don't think that a 0/31/30 build would be worthwhile... the only reason to go that far (past 21) in resto would be for Swiftmend.<br />
<br />
0/30/31 will be a really dominant build.  Swiftmend / NS and Heart of the wild = basically never dying.  I haven't even begun to think of my 70 build, as it is still so far away.<br />
<br />
For right now, I dont know what I am going to do:  spec resto and heal through tbc, spec feral and tank / dps through tbc.<br />
<br />
My guild is talking about runing BWL / AQ40 this week one last time before TBC, so I might spec 0/11/40, and just focus on instance healing in TBC for leveling.  Or I might just go pure feral and not raid (we have plenty of DPS / tanks) and just grind out that last little bit of pvp honor.  Or just continue to dominate the lv 49 bg's with my UD warlock :vampire:</div></div><hr />

I'm testing a build somewhere between what I started with and what some of you have suggested. I'll probably tweak it next week or the week after.<br />
<br />
This is what I went with:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MZxhZxEczeq0cot <br />
<br />
The leftover point is a great debate for me. Another in Living Spirit or should I go 1 in Thick Hide?<br />
<br />
Edit: Seems wowhead talent calcs link better then Blizz's or using TinyURL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">01-11-2007, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would put that point in Living Spirit to benefit your Tree of Life form. I would also considering moving the 5 points from Tranquil Spirit to Improved Regrowth. In ToL form, Regrowth is your only castable big heal, and those points will dramatically improve the efficiency of it.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe I'll pickup Imp Regrowth going forward to lvl 70.</div></div><hr />
