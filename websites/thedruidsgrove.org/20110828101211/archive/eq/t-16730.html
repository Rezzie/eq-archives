 <br />
I am obviously not keeping my spell book full but I am wondering what spells are must haves?  Spells that may not be level 75+ but that you really do need.  If anyone could help out I would really appreciate any ideas.<br />
 <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It also depends on your playstyle and AA.  For example you may not care much about the two attack debuffs after hand of ro.  I reccomend never bothering with cast invis and just go straight to buying the AA.  Also with regards to AA the second rank of entrap will save a world of trouble with cast snares, yet having Exodus doesn't mean skip cast evacs.  If you like charm and don't box an enchanter get glamour of tunare.  Some are obviously worth more so you may laugh at the others, but it's like they say: better to have and not need, than need and not have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moklianne</div><div class="date">06-05-2008, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit, when I first got it, I never used sporal spiral due to its short duration.  I had the PoP clicky pants that lasted alot longer.  However, the furthur up in lvl the mobs get the more the clicky pants get resisted, so essentially sporal spiral became more usefull due to the -MR check.  Now its all I use for rooting.  The range kinda sucks on it though.</div></div><hr />

I would rather wait until u get 72 I believe and get Vinelash Cascade in the TBS era from the Pirates of Buried Sea for Rank 1 or the Katta merchants for Rank 2. This is a AE Beam root so u do have to aim but it has bailed me out of death more times than Spore Spiral.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noken</div><div class="date">06-07-2008, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From TSS/TBS you'll definately want Mammoth's Strength.  In addition vinelash cascade is very powerful, and the two dots sunscorch and swarm of fireants stack.  So really just 4 spells.  Also, second life is identical to preincarnation of the same rank since its second effect is broken, so that can save some coin.</div></div><hr />
