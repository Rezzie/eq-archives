Simply killing one of the 6 bosses and turning in the page does not get you anything, she (Miss pure at zi) tells you that you need to do more work.  So there are steps outside of ToB you must do before she will accept your page. <br />
<br />
I had thought I next needed to work on flaggin a raid force to kill the 6 bosses in ToB.  Is there still anything else i can do in the meantime while i work on that huge project to advance through PoR progression/story?</div></div><hr />

Most guilds are still working this out, so it hasn't made it to the &quot;common knowledge&quot; stage yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a second read through I took it that the poster was asking if there were anything else to do besides progression.<br />
<br />
But I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">03-26-2006, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you could always enjoy some of the missions found around the game (Dain MM actually sounded kinda interesting and has a decent reward), do the arena quest, try exping in the new zones, there's prolly a few quests you could try out.  Several threads about all of that in this forum, assuming you're looking for non-progression stuff to do.</div></div><hr />

I finally got PoR and I must admit I'm finding it pretty interesting. More stuff do to here than in recent expansions</div></div><hr />
