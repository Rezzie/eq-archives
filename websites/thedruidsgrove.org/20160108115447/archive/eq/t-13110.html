You say, 'Hail, Eric Von Schnelling'<br />
Eric Von Schnelling seems to creak as he moves. He gives off the air of one that has lived well beyond his years but still has shining bright eyes. He smiles at you, 'Welcome to my humble, temporary and spacious residence. Please, make yourself at home. Feel free to drink my wine and eat the candies that have been given to me out of love and friendship by the Master and his many minions.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'master'<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'Him? He's a good guy. He is the only one that has a clue about what it's like to be me. Sure, he's got a bit of power and a ton of servants, but that's not the point. I have some power too. He has seen eternity and faced it down. The rest here, they pretend that eternity is just tomorrow or the day after. They keep their heads down, that's the only way they can go forward. Chumps.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'power'<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'Ah, power. Now that is a fascinating topic. You're probably not aware that to remain alive as stubbornly as I do requires rather large amounts of power? So much so that I can barely spare any to deal with people that try to kill me. That's ironic, isn't it? Over my long life I've learned some nice ways to get that power. The easiest is just to take the power stored in items. Folks waste a lot of energy building these epic items, precious energy that could be used to help keep me alive. This is a topic that the Master and I have spoken about several times. It's most certainly the reason he holds me in such high regard.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'epic'<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'Sure, like that one you have there. I can sense its power. In fact, perhaps we can work out a bargain. I'm here for several reasons, not the least of which is the fascinating conversations. I know that there is a mystical book of great power here called Shadowspine. I also know that it is weaker than it was when it was created. Pages have been, um, exercised from it and lost. These pages hold a power that make my [work] much easier.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'work'<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'I don't know that I'd call it work, exactly. But since I already have . . . Anyway, the process of devouring a powerful item requires a large amount of energy. The net gain is nothing to sneeze at, but it's not as much energy as I'd like. These pages can be used like keys to unlock that power much more easily. Each page is usually dedicated to a style of magic, so they tend to only unlock certain types of power. If you can bring me a page that matches with your epic item then maybe we can work out a [deal].'<br />
<br />
You say, 'deal'<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'Yup, a deal. If you give me a page, I'll use it. If it's the right page for your own epic item, I'll channel a bit of the extra energy I get into your item. That should make it a bit stronger. Either way, though, if you bring me a page I'll certainly use it, it's up to you to have the item in your hand that you want me to make better. You are starting to weary an old man. I get bored talking about work all the time. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss? If not, why don't you start looking for those pages, eh?' <br />
<br />
You have to get a &quot;page&quot; from Demi Plane tier 2 to get your upgraded epic... here's a list:<br />
<br />
<br />
Invocation of Eternity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83625) is for the priests (cler, druid, shaman) - Drops from Roley DeFarge<br />
<br />
Invocation of Death's Shadow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83623) is for pure melee (war, rog, monk, ber) - From The Performer event<br />
<br />
Invocation of the Last Dawn (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83624) is for hybrids (pal, sk, beastlord, ranger, bard) - From Devlin Rochester<br />
<br />
Invocation of the Night (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83626) is for casters (Wiz, Mage, Necro, Enc) - From Tris Wallows<br />
<br />
<br />
After that you just need to find Eric Von Schnelling up. Dreadspire has a rotation of weird named NPC every 12ish in-game hours. Named include Hsranitu which is a dracknid, some chick, Mundungu a zombie guy, and Eric Von Schnelling. Eric might first spawn in the guest rooms. Usually the South ones locked that you need a key for ian the Eastern part. You don't need to bother for the key, he sometimes comes out and paths to the Dining Room. He will stay up for very likely 12 in-game hours, which is roughly 72 real life minutes.<br />
<br />
Anyway when you find him... just give him the page. You do not need to worry about taking your augs off your epic as you don't need to hand it in. Just the page.<br />
<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'Well, this is exactly what I need. Hang around and watch me work, if you'd like. Keep that epic of yours in your hand and I'll make sure to channel some of my power into it. If you don't have it with in your hand, well that's unfortunate.'<br />
<br />
Eric Von Schnelling draws the power out of the page and channels it into the staff in his hands. The staff pulses with power for a moment, then that power is pulled into Eric himself. As the ritual finishes, the once mighty staff is turned to dust that fades away before it even touches the ground.<br />
<br />
Eric Von Schnelling says 'Ah, now that was refreshing! Thank you for that, I feel a dozen years younger.' <br />
<br />
The added stats will make your epic a tad more powerful, here they are:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
What does Empowerment of Shadows do?<br />
<br />
Decrease Spell/Bash Hate by 8%. I believe it simply adds itself to Serpent's Silence, unless its not working correctly. <br />
<br />
The page quest does NOT add a type 30 slot to your epic, it does not add a removable or visible augment. It adds an invisible augment which in lucy is called Brambles Shard of the Ancients (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=89476).<br />
<br />
The Empowerment of Shadows foci is different for the other epics of other classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">01-16-2006, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhere between 2nd or 3rd of tier 2. Not sure what path your guild might take though. This might change in the future... <br />
<br />
Tris seems like the popular first mob to do once you reach tier 2. Roley depends on how well you do on Devlin, and vice-versa it seems.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">01-20-2006, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demi-Plane is geared towards post Vishimtar and Anguish level of players. In order to gain access you should have defeated Sendaii the Queen of the Hive which is quite a challenge as well as Emperor Draygun and other mini quests and various other mobs. Mobs are difficult and some are still bugged. <br />
<br />
They are raiding mobs. If you read my post you can find out who they drop off.</div></div><hr />
