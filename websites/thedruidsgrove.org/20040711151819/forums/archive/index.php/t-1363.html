VI says they know Clerics can (unwillingly) hold raids hostage.<br />
VI says they want other classes to be able to fill the required healing role to change this.<br />
VI action to date on  LIVE servers over the past month:  NONE<br />
<br />
It is those facts the have severely crippled my faith in VI.<br />
Maybe,   just maybe this will change Thursday morning.<br />

<br />
You forgot to mention that Clerics recieved new heals, and the melee thing.<br />
<br />
Included in that was the DOT stack, and fixing some stacking issues.<br />
<br />
They have just botches things moreso, and PR was screwed themselves mucho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You think if this 1 heal goes in that it will change things? <br />
<br />
Even if it does go live it won't fix the game I play. My faith in VI is completely gone. The day they gave clerics all those new heals with no testing and gave druids nothing told me exactly where we stand in VI's views on priest balancing. The new heals/buffs added to paly's in the expansion says it even louder.<br />
<br />
Nothing short of an upgraded faster casting patch heal to heal casters/monks/rangers, a group heal or HoT will fix our healing situation and nothing short of a dramatic skill change will give us a raid purpose.<br />
<br />
I don't see any of these things coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WyteNK</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gimli, the added spells/stacking etc. did nothing (ie: Zero) to curb the need for clerics on raids.  This was my point in VI doing nothing;  in context of Clerics holding raids hostage.<br />
<br />
How many times have I seen this happen in the past month?  I can't count all the times on one hand, or even two.  Makes me wonder how Clerics put up with the guilt trips.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />

<br />
That gimp heal would have worked prior to Clerics getting more heals but if they think they can shove that heal out Thursday and that's it for Druids they are mistaken.<br />
<br />
Balancing does NOT mean give all healing classes a bump in healing!<br />
<br />
If a class is too weak in healing and you bump up all the healing classes you still leave the unbalanced class unaffected.<br />
<br />
Verant must think we are stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's maybe like 3-4 mobs that we can't do with less than 4 clerics.<br />
<br />
We NEED at least 1 mage and 2 shamans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids should be able to cast modrods, CH, AND topor /nod.<br />
<br />
lmao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh?  You can get by on raids without shamans, although they are big plus to have along unlike druids.  My guild is low on shamans so we know from experience although we usually can get at least 1-2 shaman on, but sometimes we had 0.  All you need is a mage to cast mala, and the enchanter to slow, no Shaman needed.   Focus is a nice hp buff, but can get by without.  In the same vein, you can do things without any mages as mod rods arent essential just a very nice plus (remember pre-Luclin the original mod rod wasnt all that great of mana efficiency).   However, you cant effectively do a raid without CH.   Non-CH spells are too mana intensive/too small to keep a raid going aside from the 20 second and under dragon fights in Kunark.  There are a few other fights were CH isnt feasible due to unresistable knockback, but 95% of the raids are based around CH.  That is holding a raid hostage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JigsawDenniz</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm...<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about 20 second fights.  I'm talking about the marathon mobs.  The ones with 500k+ hitpoints and high AC.  The ones where when multiple manaburns go in, the % health of the target doesn't change.  The ones that require CH rotations.  The ones that require modrodding clerics.  Can an enchanter slow?  Hell yes.  Can he topor modrodding clerics and mages?  Nope.<br />
<br />
Topor + Modrod = endless mana for clerics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um Torpor is far from a necessity for a raid, even for a marathon fight.  You make it sound like ONLY a shaman can heal a magician and ONLY with torpor, neither are required to heal mod-rodding magicians.  In addition, you can do a raid without any magicians, just add in more clerics and necros.  Now for the truly marathon fight, just one magician can make a huge difference with the rods, but it still might be possible to get by without any (from experience it is possible to get by without any magicians on the shorter fights, but we never bothered to try long ones without a magician there ;p).  Really the main issue is that a raid can go just fine with just 1 magician and 1 shaman there, while the raid requires anywhere from 5-12 clerics depending on what you are doing and the rest of the raid make-up.   Clerics have and will be necessary on any type of raid fight from the 2 minute to 20 minute fights.   If a raid can continue with just 1 magician/shaman, why should you be forced to wait for 10 clerics to log on??<br />
<br />
Maybe PoP will be going back to the sub-1 minute fights where CH isnt such a necessity, but if that is true they are going to have to disable mana-burn in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tippwindy</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could it be?  Bug fixes?  Could they possibly be fixing all the bugs they introduced with the last major patch they did?<br />
<br />
- Bugs in DoT stacking system.  Someone getting another persons spell wears off message.<br />
<br />
- Bugs in spell stacking system.  Oh, Malisement is suppose to overwrite circle of seasons? Umm.. no.<br />
<br />
- Bugs in wizzie epic quest faction.  Handing in epic pieces and getting squat in return SUCKS! :p <br />
<br />
- Bugs in the new UI.  Oh, you did those tradeskill combines too fast, time to boot you out and destroy the last item you combined.<br />
<br />
- Bugs in illusion spells.  No, I'm not nakid, my clothes are just invisible. :p <br />
<br />
- The new craptacular resist system.  Oh? It's not a bug?  Working as intended?  Bah.<br />
<br />
- Other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
- Fixing the Cleric epic quest.  That 24 hour Zordak in SolB is just too much of a bottleneck.  Lets turn him into a merchant that sells the final Cleric epic for 6 copper.  J/K &lt;3 Clerics. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alyn Cross</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">more likely the bug they're fixing is this:<br />
<br />
Cleric hammer pets are deemed to last too short a time.  They're now working as intended with a check for agro after 3 minutes... if nothing exists to swing at, the hammer will poof.  if it has a target, another check will be performed in 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Cleric summoned hammers have been found to do an inordinate ammount of damage against undead only.  we have thus upped the dmg/dly of the weapons to 25/17 against all types of enemy.<br />
<br />
Clerics were found to be lacking a few heal areas.  We've added and instacast 1k heal for 50 mana called 'broken spirit of the druid' that will suffice nicely for patch heals on casters and modding clerics.<br />
<br />
We discovered most casters and priests didn't have enough melee AA's and gave them all double attack and ambidex.  We are evaluating on test the use of finishing blow, combat fury, and the rogue assassinate ability for casters in the next patch.<br />
<br />
we discovered 1/8th of our player base has decided to quit or start other classes... join us for a gm event in the desert of ro, to say goodbye to .... what class was that again?  The clerics are bringing holy cake, and the beastlords will bring the mana and regen spells...<br />
<br />
right?<br />
