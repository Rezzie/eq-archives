I am going to create a druid but i want to know what role the druid plays in a group situation and also in raids. If there is a post containing this information... sorry and please point me in the right direction :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are &quot;jack of all trades, master of none.&quot;  They can kite, heal, DPS, port, buff, charm animals, and of course die like the rest of them!  We can choose to solo or group for experience.  Groups may require a little effort on your part to get going.  A supportive guild and strong friends list is recommended (by me anyway).<br />
<br />
Groups - buff the tanks with DS and STR.  Save mana for heals if no other priest around.  If cleric is in group, by all means add DPS with nukes or DoTs for the longer fights.  Harmony is good at lvl 6 for pulling singles in outside zones (upgrade is Harmony of Nature at lvl 29).  The first Debuff (AC) you get is Immolate at lvl 25.  That will help your melee group members do more damage (high lvl debuff is Hand of Ro).<br />
<br />
For Raids you are most likely there to debuff (AC, ATK, fire, cold), heal and cure.  If healing from other priests is sufficient, I do like to add my own DPS with nukes.  Of course for the healing druids, maxing the Healing Adept and Gift AA lines are preferred.  The Radiant Cure line is also good to have.  There's much more talk about AA's in the Spell / AA forum.<br />
<br />
If I come across any comprehensive guide, I'll be sure to post a link.  Until then, this little reply should get you started.  <br />
