 Before you do a single CE quest in HFP, ZM, BEM or NS, turn in 360 Unitendified Plant Parts (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24401) to get to honored (360 can be purchased off the AH for 100-150g, do it!)<br />
 Once you reach honored, turn in any uncatalogued species (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24407) you get from the above turn-ins.<br />
 Do all quests in HFP, ZM, BEM and NS.  Once this step is done, you will be well into Revered.<br />
 Consider getting epic flight form as that quest chain gives quite a bit of honor.<br />
 Run regular SV, heroic UB (IMO, quite easy) or heroic SP (also very easy)<br />
 Turn in any Coilfang Armaments that drop from SV or hSP.<br />
<br />
Step 5 should be done after you reach honored.<br />
Step 6 cannot be done until you complete a quest that starts from a random drop in SV.  Don't turn in armaments until you have reached honored.<br />
<br />
You can also run regular SP and UB until you are honored in lieu of turning in plant parts.<br />
<br />
For Step 1 and Step 6, I had my banking alt purchase cheap-o parts and armaments off the AH the whole time I was leveling.  I had all 360 plant parts by the time I was lvl 50 for well less than 125g (which is just about &quot;free&quot; in terms of BC economy).  From levels 60-70+ I purchased 40+ armaments.</div></div><hr />

Although point number 2 doesn't really make sense since as noted in the same post you can no longer hand in plant parts once you are Honoured.<br />

Personally I just ran steam vaults a bunch of times.<br />

Although point number 2 doesn't really make sense since as noted in the same post you can no longer hand in plant parts once you are Honoured.During the turn in of Unidentified Plant Parts (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24401), you get a &quot;packet&quot; as a reward.  Most of the time it contains junk.  Rarely it contains an uncatalogued species (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24407).  The later should not be turned in until after you reach honored from turning in the 360 Unidentified Plant Parts, as they can be turned in after reaching honored.<br />

I had the wrong terms in my original posts.  I'll edit it now to make it clearer.</div></div><hr />

So, don't be afraid to mix-n-match SV, hUB and hSP on your way to Exalted.</div></div><hr />

<br />

The first thing I do it run over to Zangarmarsh right after lvl 60 and then do all of the turn ins.  It works out just great.  Plus it gives my herbalist a good excuse to abuse the giants in zangar for a while.</div></div><hr />

It was great, b/c now he doesn't have to grind CR instances to honoured (which I always do because I am very conscious about rep).</div></div><hr />

I got my offhand from badges, and my feral staff dropped in SSC a few weeks back. But can use exalted for the potions you get for turning in those marks from ssc and tk.</div></div><hr />
