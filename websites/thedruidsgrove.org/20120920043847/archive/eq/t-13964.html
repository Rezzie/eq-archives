<br />
I went to PoV for the first time a few days ago, and found that I was getting better exp charm aggro kiting ravens in PoN. But I stuck around because it was fun. I was only getting about .5% per kill, with a kill taking about 5 minutes. Either way, I switched to AA 100% to see what kind of AA exp I could get, and I got a whopping 4% per kill. That's only 25 kills to an AA! So I've decided to suck all the life out of AAing before I move back on to leveling, because I'm sure as soon as I ding the exp at PoN will begin to suck and I don't want to waste PoN.<br />
<br />
So, what path do I take? I already have Run Speed 2, but what do I do after RS3? Innate Regen? And then what do I do for my class abilities?</div></div><hr />

For the archetype AA's, there is almost universal agreement that your first 14 points go into SCM1-3 and MC1.  After that there are quite a few opinions on the best route to go.<br />

For example, when I'm soloing in PoStorms, I get between 10-12% AA per kill.  PoN is actually still good for XP up through level 62.  I found that the lower XP per kill was more than made up for by faster kills.  At 63, a lot of PoN becomes light blue, and you get a new charm spell that works in PoStorms.<br />
<br />
For which AAs to take, I agree with Tat.  After getting those, you'll probably want to level up to 59 to be eligible for the class AAs.  If you enjoy charming, Innate Camo is awesome.  And exodus has saved my life countless times when I try something &quot;daring.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I charmed from 53 to 55 in PoN, charming ravens, aggro kiting trees and spiders. I probably killed a total of one hundred mobs, so I bet innate camo is good.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If your quad kiting work on your nuke crit aa's,  if your more charm kiting (which is GREAT exp in PoStorms at 65) then work on your defensive aa's,  if your grouping you may be more heal oriented,  then work on those aa's.<br />
 <br />
I agree SCM 1-3 is the way to go right away,  MC1 is great for its cost,  then either work on defensive aa's or nuke,  and once able get Innate Cammo.  You wont regret it.  Then your back to aa'n up your path.  Finish nuke crit and then go to quick nuke aa's,  etc.</div></div><hr />
