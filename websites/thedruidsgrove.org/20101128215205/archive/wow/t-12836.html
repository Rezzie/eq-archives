The hardest part about being a tank is learning how to pull. Mastering the art of pulling large groups of mobs with one click of the mouse is easy. Pulling only a few takes patience, observation and impeccable timing. *click* &quot;Look, I pulled  half the Banquet Hall!&quot;<br />
<br />
2. The feral gear drop rate in Kara sucks. Big time.<br />
<br />
3. Epic flight form is the absolute best part about being a druid. Herbing in epic flight form is intensely amusing. Doing the Ogril'la bombing run with &quot;Danger Zone&quot; blaring in the headset is a real treat<br />
<br />
4. Grinding CE rep is surprisingly difficult to arrange while trying to avoid pugs.<br />
<br />
5. Anyone who is even halfway decent in a pug should be immediately friended. A well-stocked friends list is an essential part of doing daily heroics.<br />
<br />
6. Making interrupt effects only available on PVP kitty gear -- effectively forcing druids to PVP to advance past Kara -- was a truly braindead decision by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
7. With a small amount of effort, making money in WoW is surprisingly easy.<br />
<br />
8. Potion recipes that are only obtainable after grinding rep in a 20-man instance that no one does anymore is frustrating.<br />
<br />
9. Anyone who thinks kitties are no good at dps is an idiot.<br />
<br />
10. The badge system + daily heroics is a brilliant way to encourage level 70 players to keep playing.</div></div><hr />

The hardest part about being a tank is learning how to pull. I would append that Marking (kill order, CC assignments, etc.) is difficult as well.  The tank is expected to know every mob's abilities and how to use every class in your group to counter them the best way.  That, is the part I find the most difficult while tanking (5-mans).  But, it is also the part I find the most rewarding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you guys think mob XXX is a caster?  His name sort sounds like a caster?  Isn't mob ZZZ the one that does an AoE fear every few seconds?&quot;<br />

As a 5-man tank you are expected to know every pull in every instance, even those you have never run before....:grin:</div></div><hr />

Oh...absolutely, marking is a huge challenge. I have no idea how I'm supposed to mark most of the mobs in the instances. And every instance is different. The worm-thingies explode, these guys spit out ghosts you have to avoid, these guys spawn mobs that can MC your group....maybe in 6 months I'll be able to remember everything. And I still haven't tried all the instances (the Arkanar, MT, anything in Caverns of Time...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um....yes, mostly. I've been told other than the stupid interrupt gloves I'm ready for Gruuls, despite having blues for half my kitty gear (3200+ AP, over 40% crit chance raid buffed, over 600dps). Unfortunately our guild only does Gruuls with an alliance of other guilds, which is a challenge in and of itself.<br />
<br />
My plans for tanking upgrades got derailed last night. I was saving for a tanking cloak (Slikks? something like that) but I got the Thoriumweave off Illhoof. So now I need something to target. I'll probably focus on dps because of the new expansion. Maybe a ring, since the rings I want in Kara aren't dropping.<br />
<br />
In bear form I'm so far over the uncrittable cap it's not funny, but I can't switch to dps gear without taking a huge armor hit.  I'm finally over 28k armor raid buffed, but my dodge is only 34% or so.<br />
<br />
I was pretty pleased with my aggro generation -- other than that damn uber warlock who can generate 25% of the raid's dps -- until I offtanked last night with a very well-geared warrior. She could take aggro from me fairly effortlessly, which is discouraging.<br />
<br />
All in all, yeah it's going well.</div></div><hr />

That's why I heal.  :grin: <br />
<br />
The main thing your group(s) should be concerned about is you keeping aggro (and them holding back so that you can do so).  And, don't you worry about having to know every aspect of a raid.  You're not alone in there.  That's why there is a Raid Assistant.<br />
<br />
So don't sweat it....it will become clear as mud any day now.  ;)  <br />
<br />
P.S. - Our Druid tank likes to pull with Starfire.  I'm not a tank, so I can't tell you why he prefers it, but I can tell you he never &quot;overpulls&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a tank, so I can't tell you why he prefers it,It generates quite a bit of threat over just FFF.  Plus the long casting time means he is able to shift into bear as soon as the shot goes off since the GCD is over before the cast is complete.  I use it often in heroics to pull those tough guard type mobs that come in pairs and can't be CC'd.  Starfire the X mob so I can focus on skull without fear that X will run off and one-shot the healer.</div></div><hr />

That's why there is a Raid Assistant.I don't consider marking much of an issue in Raids, but in 5-mans it is typically the tanks responsibility.  That's where pulling and marking are more important.  In Raids those aspects of tanking are not nearly as critical as typically the RL does it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-18-2008, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i dislike doing the marking as i'm in the game to play a heroic and have fun not to know every single thing about every mob in every instance. so i dont tend to and it seems ok with someone else doing it. :)<br />
<br />
Grim - do you mean the Thoriumweave from Capacitus in Mech ?  its a great cloak but Sikk's is a good upgrade. i'm currently planning on getting one next now i've got all other needed tank upgrades like chest/legs/gloves/ring etc<br />
<br />
Mag - yeah sometimes i wish i was healer with the marking / tanking stuuf ! lol<br />
<br />
i agree fully with 3) although i cant say i've had Danger Zone blaring out whilst ever doing the Bombing Run !<br />
<br />
<br />
4) CE Rep - grinded almost all of it from revered to exalted in pugs. being at the time in a guild of 2 ! it was me to tank, the priest to heal and we just found 3 dps.  from that though we got some good friends in other bigger guilds some of which we still grp with now and again which links nicely into your 5).<br />
<br />
<br />
7)  its a piece of cake tbh. i could never have imagined having so much money i dont know what to do with it pre BC.<br />
<br />
10) exactly. i'd have stopped playing long ago with heroics/badges and the chance to get upgrades given i do not raid anywhere.</div></div><hr />

No, I meant the Gilded Thorium Cloak from Illhoof. It's a very nice cloak, just doesn't have the dodge I wanted.</div></div><hr />

I've been a healer for so long that the first time I ran my sPriest through a 5-man and the tank asked me to MC Star, I thought &quot;Huh?  cc something?  Me?!?  Well, this just SUCKS!&quot;<br />

<br />
I'm terrified of being a healer. First off, there's the whole &quot;I'm a tree&quot; thing. Secondly, from EQ I know how important timing is, and I have no idea how the timing works with healing in WoW. Something about stacking 6 lifeblooms and recasting before they wear off? Okay that's one, two, three...oh, do you need a rez?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still am.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
The pressure of healing never really goes away.  But I will admit it becomes rather secondary by nature.  <br />
<br />
As for the timings, you can try to follow the lifebloom stack rules, but there will always be an aggro generating Lock, Mage or BOOMKIN (you know who you are!) available to throw a wrench into that timing.  ;)</div></div><hr />

As a 5-man tank you are expected to know every pull in every instance, even those you have never run before....:grin:<br />
<br />
there's an addon called Mobinfo that comes in very handy for marking. Basically, it tells you what kind of class your target is... back when i was running bunches and bunches of instances, i found it useful to ask hunters their spec... if they had silencing shot (or w/e the heck it's called) then they could take care of the casters etc etc...<br />
<br />
sometimes i would also say &quot;i don't wanna mark... you mark, me bash&quot; which was usually followed in /p by &quot;lol... i'll mark&quot;</div></div><hr />

That was a great post.  And very true.  Did you go insane from the CE rep grind because I sure as hell almost did.  It was like a month before I could stomach running any Coilfang instances again.<br />

Oh gods, are you talking about the Zalandar tribe Recipes though?  I'm going nuts for that.  I ran into ZG to kill two bosses and I'm still neutral.   I'm never going to get my living action pot recipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, given LK will be released soon, you may not want to even bother with CE rep.  In fact, I wouldn't bother at all.  Pickup a Braxxas off the AH for any Outland 5-mans you might run and then pick-up one of the LK tanking staffs. (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?items=2&amp;filter=ub=11;cr=131:41;crs=1:1;crv=0:0#0+2+1)  At least one of LK tanking staffs is available from a starter zone quest.  So, you could have it as soon as lvl 68.</div></div><hr />

It'll be nice to have the ability to skip rep quests.  Right now, whatever Rep quests I have, I just grind on them when I'm burnt out on questing or instances and just want to do something mindless for awhile.  Yay for SPIRIT BEADS!</div></div><hr />
