I just got SUPER lucky last night and found a recipie to Transmute Undeath to Water on the AH for about 1g.  Thought I'd share the amount of money that is to be made off this.<br />
<br />
Bought a stack of 10 Essence of Undeath for 3g.  Thats 33s a piece.<br />
<br />
Selling 1 Essence of Water for 10-12g, and they go like hotcakes.  <br />
<br />
Cooldown time is only 1day (unlike arcanite, which is 2).  So basically I'm making about 10g per day from here on out without trying.  If any of you alchemists out there see that recipie on the AH, but it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-27-2006, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It costs over 100g on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-27-2006, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  I've never seen it that high.  I've seen it from 50-70g though.  Thats why I said I got super lucky :P  100g seems pretty high to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-27-2006, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would it when you can recover the cost in less than two weeks and then be sitting on a cash cow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-27-2006, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just seems like a lot for a recipie because they sell for 50-80g on my server.  But as you pointed out, yes, you can make your money back very quick.  I love that it is only a 1 day cooldown.<br />
<br />
I just started this thread to point out another great money making opportunity within alchemy for those of us that are saving for our epic mounts, hide of the wild, or any of a number of nice enchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked for it again last night and saw it listed at 250g buy out.  I'm sure he didn't sell it at that price, but eventually some twink will probably pay through the nose for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ezendius</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A person I know does that, made me like alchemy even more (potions + easy cash, what's not to like?).<br />
He makes 9 gold a day. For a person like me who's too lazy to put junk on the AH and just sells it to a vendor most of the time, this rocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ZOMG.  I almost feel bad now taking advantage of that noob that put the recipie up for a 1g buyout.  Wait, no I dont.  His loss!  :wiggle:   <br />
<br />
On that note, if anyone is on Spirestone, feel free to send me a message ingame and I'll transmute some Waters for ya :)<br />
<br />
Just got my alt priest to 280 alchemy as well, so she'd my arcanite transmute-bot.  Dual alchemists rock.  I have the +40 shadow damage pot and +20 spell damage pot recipies on my Druid - I send my shadow priest lots of both pots, and shes nasty :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rob_Nevyn</div><div class="date">03-29-2006, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It goes for 220 - 250g on average on my server, I have had it offered to me for 188g and now wonder if i should have taken it.<br />
I don't think anyone will see it for 1g ever again, you lucky lucky bastard :grin:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rob_Nevyn</div><div class="date">03-29-2006, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a noob question, I have seen the opposite transmute (Water to Undeath) recipie on the AH for between 14g and 100g. Why would anyone want to do that considering one Ess of Water is 8-10g and one Ess of Undeath is only 30-50s?</div></div><hr />

Only once have I seen it for sale and that was last night, 450g min, 550g buyout.</div></div><hr />
