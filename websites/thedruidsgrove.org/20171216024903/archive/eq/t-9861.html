The ranger epic 2.0 is seemingly started with a mob that pops when they get near in Causeway.  So, ShowEQ'rs should be on the lookout for any strange triggers such as that.<br />

The zone that no one has entered yet.<br />
<br />
Epic 2.0s are going to be the best items in the expansion for every class.  They wont be coming out for a while I wouldnt think.  So that would be a bit of discouragement for any high end guild types who the 2.0 is designed for, at least until their guild pops into Anguish and finds out if these globes drop off random mobs or raid encounters like Luclinite did.<br />
<br />
It seems like working on the 2.0 quest isnt really worth it for those it is targeted for since they wont be completeing it for a while anyway.  That and the fact that most druids cant complete the epic since Kith is borked.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
[Sat Oct 09 21:42:27 2004] You say, 'Hail, Reyfin Malakwa'<br />
[Sat Oct 09 21:42:28 2004] Reyfin Malakwa stares silently out over the ocean towards the magical wards protecting the ship from the unyielding onslaught of the pounding waves. He jumps back terrorized when he realizes your presence. His visage calms a bit when he senses you mean him no immediate harm. He ponders you timidly for a moment and then leans down and begins drawing something in the sea grime that covers one of the boxes. You study his sketch for a moment and begin to understand that it is a rune of sorts. Three arching lines join in the center to form a sort of Y-shape.<br />
[Sat Oct 09 21:42:35 2004] The bedraggled Taelosian refugee looks up at you after drawing the symbol and looks you directly in the eyes for the first time. He seems to draw strength from your presence and you sense that he feels the power of nature that you carry. He smiles weakly at you and then bends down and erases the symbol by smearing around the surrounding grime. He then draws a new symbol. This symbol is much more complicated, it is an arch with rods protruding from either side at the base. The rod to the right splits into four branches, the one on the left ends in a swirl. He looks up at you with a pleading look in his eyes as he hands you a small bag that appears to be made from his own clothing.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I recieved Ragged Cloth Bag item # 0062881<br />
 <br />
I had another person in the zone Hail Rayfin, he didn't recieve the bag. I then had another druid from my guild with epic 1.5 hail him and he too recieved the bag.<br />

2 rune fragments (foraged in Barindu) = DNC<br />

I tried foraging in other GoD zones for maybe a third run fragment, nothing so far, just lots of duplicate lore messages.<br />

Anyway, I have another theory.  I have a &quot;Top Segment of a signet&quot; (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9956)  That I found on an Ikaav in Bloodfields.  I checked the lore and it reads &quot;The top third of a delicately engraved signet&quot;  A delicate engraving could be what he was drawing?<br />

Either Saturday or Sunday I was with a group in Riwi and died.  While waiting for a rez, I foraged the runed fragments.  When I went to loot my corpse, it said I had a duplicate lore item which happened to be the runed fragment.  Then later on Sunday I foraged another runed fragment that also stated it was a lore item.  So I ended up with two lore runed framents.  They looked the same and said the same things.  Unfortunately I do not have them anymore and I'm not sure where I foraged the items.  The zones we fought in were Riwi, WoS, Frontier Mountains (my bind point), Nobles Causeway, and Barindu.  Hope someone can use this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aladriel</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been wracking my brain on this.  One item I am curious about is this rune fragments (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=66113).  Note this is &quot;rune fragments&quot; not &quot;rune fragment&quot; (the ones that have been found to be foraged in GoD).  If you follow the link to Alla's, it says foraged in Barindu which is wrong.  The people who posted under that item got it confused with the &quot;rune fragment&quot;.  If you notice, the &quot;rune fragments&quot; are no rent.  Peaked my interest due to the fact that the disease rune from 1.5 was no rent.  I do realize that this ID number is not in line with ours.  I just find it interesting that since the current info on it is incorrect, that means there is no correct info for it yet.<br />
<br />
Another idea I had involves the noc fang and the bloodroot wine.  Anyone remember the coldain shawl quests?  Shawl #7 involved etching a blank rune through use of a burin (made from a tooth + tusk + hide) and ink made from various components.  It also involves a rune pattern.  For full info see Shawl #7 (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q136&amp;menustr=120060070000).  As soon as I saw the wine and the fang I immediately thought of this.<br />
<br />
Now I do realize that this wine might be randomly out of order as far as ID numbers go, but I don't think so.  This wine was one of a number of brewing items that were included in a book.  See &quot;Unusual Wine and Ale&quot; Books.  (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=18271).  I looked up all the ID numbers for all of the bottles and casks of these items and they are all in the same range EXCEPT for the bloodroot wine.  This makes me think that it is where it is on purpose.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking that maybe we turn in the rune fragments + something else and we receive a pattern for the whole rune or something to this effect.  Or perhaps we need to make something with these items that combines with the rune fragments.<br />
<br />
As to the shape of the drawing with spiral and the other end with 4 branches.  If you look at the actual epic 1.5 in game....there is a protrusion of an arch around the area where you hold the item.  There are 4 &quot;branches&quot; coming from the staff which surround the top crystal.  The bottom of the staff isn't exactly a spiral though.  Just typing what I have thought about.<br />
<br />
Lastly, this is a map I found of all the current zones in Everquest World of Everquest (http://www.crimsontalon.org/images/maps/everquest.gif).  If you look at the map of Taelosia...the left side of the map shows Ferubi, Barindu, Riwwi etc.  The 3 zones where you can forage the rune fragment(s).  When I looked at this, it looked like a spiral to me.  If you're familiar with this area, you can go from Qinimi to Ferubi to Barindu to Riwwi to Qinimi to Ferubi blah blah and all other different combinations to infinity basically (if you had the time :))  This seems like a spiral to me, which would indicate that the spiral represents the 2 rune fragment(s).<br />
<br />
As far as the end with the 4 branches....there are 2 possibilities on the right side of the map.  There are (4) Ikkinz raid trials which branch off of KT.  There are also (4) sewer trials which branch off of Barindu.  While doing an Ikk4 raid the other night, I kept foraging and didn't get anything odd.  (although I was quite busy so I only foraged during down time).  I also did not see any new drops off of the mobs or anything that seemed to be for a druid.  I did look up the ID numbers of items that dropped that I wasn't familiar with but none were even close to our range of numbers.<br />
<br />
So these are my thoughts and things I have been working on.  I plan on spending some time in the sewers.  I haven't killed any nameds since OOW has come out (was killing them for the BiC items before I got busy with OOW).  If I find anything, will post.<br />
<br />
Oops one other thing that caught my attention, probably has nothing to do with it....one of the paladins in my guild has this weapon Votal's Ornate Blade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68570).  You can't tell by the icon, you'd have to see it in game up close.  But he happened to be standing in front of me at a raid and I glanced at it and and said &quot;woah&quot;.  Asked him where he got it etc..  If you look at it in game, it has a spiral on it and a line with 4 slashes coming down.  Just thought it was interesting. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reyfin Malakwa stares silently out over the ocean towards the magical wards protecting the ship from the unyielding onslaught of the pounding waves.  He jumps back terrorized when he realizes your presence.  His visage calms a bit when he senses you mean him no immediate harm.  He ponders you timidly for a moment and then leans down and begins drawing something in the sea grime that covers one of the boxes.  You study his sketch for a moment and begin to understand that it is a rune of sorts.  Three arching lines join in the center to form a sort of Y-shape.<br />
<br />
To me this is a reference to the 3 zones of GoD that come together to give a person access to the High Temple, Txevu.  Directly, this has little to do with our quest but it leads up to what Reyfin says next...<br />
<br />
The bedraggled Taelosian refugee looks up at you after drawing the symbol and looks you directly in the eyes for the first time.  He seems to draw strength from your presence and you sense that he feels the power of nature that you carry.  He smiles weakly at you and then bends down and erases the symbol by smearing around the surrounding grime.  He then draws a new symbol.  This symbol is much more complicated, it is an arch with rods protruding from either side at the base.  The rod to the right splits into four branches, the one on the left ends in a swirl.  He looks up at you with a pleading look in his eyes as he hands you a small bag that appears to be made from his own clothing.<br />
<br />
Following the prior statement, this arch, would also likely be a figurative drawing for a separate set of realms.  On the left side, you would have Taelosia and its foraged rune fragments.  On the right, you would have the Realm of Discord and a reference to a possible subquest involving 4 substeps (4 branches) to attain the 3rd and final rune fragment.</div></div><hr />

There's an insignia denoting each of the six trials.  If you look towards the sky when clearing to a trial you will also see the symbol floating in space.<br />

The only one that  piques my interest is that of Power - it is a series of lines curved towards an apex, where the center line ends in a swirl.  There was no symbol that looked to be a set of 4 branches.</div></div><hr />

I got a reply from a 67 druid saying that was the drop he was after. Then told me that he spawned it upon zoning in with a &quot;Wind Shard&quot; that he linked to me. He said it was for the Druid Epic 2.0. I looked and looked for either item online and found nothing but I thought this worth mentioning as this thread seems to be at a standstill. I did let the guy loot the item and I felt it worth mentioning here.<br />
 <br />
Hope it help.</div></div><hr />

I am so glad I could help even if in some small and vague way.  I have been watching this board alot as my old main is a 66 Druid.  I have been vigorously working on both of our 1.5s.  I am now 2 kills from mine (Warr 1.5) and he is at the Natimbi Event.  This board was a HUGE help along the way getting as far on the Druid 1.5 as I have.  I wish I had more info to supply.  I added this guy to my friends list and haven't seen him on since and I play quite a bit.  I don't feel right calling this guy out directly on this board as I don't want to look like the &quot;bad guy&quot;.  I will say it happened on the Quellious Server and he is in one of the bigger Raiding guilds here.  He was also equipped with the 1.5 when he came and looted the shard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jwillowyse</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mages are indeed looking for drops corresponding to the four elements, but according to their epic thread on The Mage Compendium, what they are looking for are the Primal Elemental Essences...Essence of Body (earth), Essence of Order (water), Essence of Chaos (fire), and Essence of Spirit (wind).  Frost and wind shards do not figure into either their 1.5 or 2.0.<br />
<br />
Let's not forget that we also use each of the four elements to some degree.  We have fire, earth, ice, and wind spells (some of which are just about useless, but that's not the point.)<br />
<br />
That these two shards are seemingly not part of the mage epic, are not used to spawn the WoS raid mob, both have ID numbers within the range identified as pertaining to the druid epic, and the Frost Shard was spawned by a druid zoning into NC with the Wind Shard upon his person (thanks Lance), still leads me to believe that they figure into the druid quest in some fashion.</div></div><hr />

That we don't know at the moment.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that if this is in fact a quest to spawn a mob, then find the npc that starts this quest and make sure this is true. Also it ocurred to me that maybe the mob that you spawn with this crystals may be related to our epic 2.0 BUT this is highly unlikely and easy to prove. The mob that you spawn drops some runes and loot, if this mob spawns a chest for those items then i would say we should look into it, however if it does not and you get loot directly from him then I would say this quest is not related due to this expansion's tendency to spawn chests on epic mobs for loot and not directly from them.<br />
<br />
What boggles me even more is that I've done all i can and i'm sure the rest of the community as well to continue with this epic quest but we are so clueless right now that i'm beginning to think this epic 2.0 is :bs:. I mean we have done NOTHING to progress on it and if you recall the periods of time we had to figure out stuff on 1.5 they were nowhere as long as this one.<br />
<br />
In any case... We should double our efforts Lord Vader! (8&lt;|<br />

 <br />
 I have only been reading this thread occasionaly since I really haven't even gotten the chance to do much on epic 1.5. I remember several pages back about the foraged rune fragments being foraged in Barindu. There were not many messages but they clearly stated that you could forage two rune fragments in Barindu. My experience was different and I just chalked it up to the RNG. I also had done identify on two fragements that I had and noticed they were different. Today I read this thread from front to back to make sure I didn't miss any information.<br />
 <br />
 Like the above poster I foraged my two rune fragments in Barindu and Ferubi. I had done an identify on them and one identified as &quot;A part of a runed stone&quot; and the other identified as &quot;A part of a rune carved stone&quot;. Now I forget which is which, but I am very sure that I got them in the zones mentioned. I had spent much time in Barindu attempting to get AA at Vxed entrance and foraged a fair amount. I had often received the Duplicate Lore item message while foraging. After quite a bit of time I as finally in Ferubi either for Rondo raid or helping a cleric with map piece and foraged the second rune fragment. Since an earlier message sounded very positive that both could be foraged in Barindu, I know it could have been a streaky RNG or that the second rune fragment is rarer. It also wasn't clear to me how confident the previous posters were of exactly where they were foraged. I just didn't know whether anyone had a rune fragment that identifies differently.<br />
 <br />
 Granted, these may have nothing to do with 2.0. I just wasn't sure whether we stopped short. I could always destroy the runes and reforage and identify to see if I can forage either of them in either zone. I really haven't spent any real time in any of the other zones, so some of you have likely done all the foraging necessary to convince us that there are only two in the GoD zones. If anyone has a rune fragment that identifies differently it would be interesting to know about.<br />
 <br />
 Caveats: I only read this thread on 2.0 so maybe I missed something.  I also dont look at the various databases with ID numbers.</div></div><hr />

So, it's apparent that someone  is indeed forging ahead with 2.0 and has made a connection somwhere somehow.<br />
<br />
Noc fang is #62864<br />
rune fragments are #62865,62866<br />
<br />
So, going by this alone, it would seem we turn the noc fang into someone, get a minor errand job, at the end of which we get #62867 rune.  Combine these 3 runes in the bag given to us by  Reyfin to create the Rune of Yuisaha.  Turn that back in for the next step in our epic 2.0, probably involving the wind &amp; frost shards which come next in the Magelo db (62871, 62873).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">11-08-2004, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Encountered these this evening:<br />
Rune of Yuisaha (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=62868) #62868<br />
as well as:<br />
Thick leather bag (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=62884) #62884<br />
<br />
So, it's apparent that someone  is indeed forging ahead with 2.0 and has made a connection somwhere somehow.<br />
<br />
Noc fang is #62864<br />
rune fragments are #62865,62866<br />
<br />
So, going by this alone, it would seem we turn the noc fang into someone, get a minor errand job, at the end of which we get #62867 rune.  Combine these 3 runes in the bag given to us by  Reyfin to create the Rune of Yuisaha.  Turn that back in for the next step in our epic 2.0, probably involving the wind &amp; frost shards which come next in the Magelo db (62871, 62873).<br />
Very interesting. I would assume so as well, hmmm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one agree with Kinaki and we should indeed work hard instead of diverting our attention. I think we wasted enough time on the 1.5 quest doing this and while I myself consider it BS to hoard stuff IF you read the boards (while i am positive that they in fact do read some kind of boards), I think we need to steer away from accusations. Remember our number of people researching and looking for stuff this time are smaller for whatever reason it may be, so we need to do double the work.<br />
<br />
If you come here to post: &quot;well hoarding is BS, etc&quot;, you should consider posting on the rant board (Unkempt Druids) as to keep this thread clean for all the information that arises. Let me rephrase myself: if you post here make it so that you're contributing and not wasting bandwidth. That is my general opinion, not that it should be followed.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Epic so far:<br />
The frost shard and wind shard theory has NOT been confirmed if indeed it is or is not part of our epic 2.0 quest. I will add this to the walkthrough to avoid confusion as part of a rumor.<br />
<br />
As for me, I'm gathering GoD runes to try the combine in the bag. But well, like you all know Eril is incredibly elusive... so this will take a bit of time. Just wanted to give you all a status report on what I was on so that you all don't think we're slacking off.</div></div><hr />

Aneuk Overseer? What's his ph? Is it the 2 Aneuks near sewers? Hmm I might farm him then. I did sewers for Yiktu and KT named for Jeiki... been doing some more sewers for Eril but no luck. Anyway, i'll try to get that named.</div></div><hr />

Greetings all,<br />
<br />
Like I said, this quest is indeed working and the npcs are in and functioning.  However, I can only watch you agonize over this for so long.   I want you to have fun with this, not get stuck.<br />
<br />
Because the clue is a bit nebulous and may have required too much interpretation on your part (though most have interpreted far more than I would have imaginedjust not in the right way), I'm going to give you a minor hint in advance of a more obvious text update.<br />
<br />
Here it is...<br />
<br />
The creature is the same and it has always been scurrying about. However, when it is found, the insightful shaman will notice something that sets this creature apart from others affected by the spirit and how these differences may affect this part of the quest.<br />
<br />
The text will updated in the next patch and provide a bit more detail so it is fair for those who may not read the boards.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grayson</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been proceeding with the assumption that somewhere there is an NCP who is a friend or relation of Reyfin Malakwa and will respond to tells that include the name (actually I made a button with several /says; who is Reyfin Malakwa?, do you know about the rune fragments?...junk like that).  I have not been as methodical or logical in my search as I would have liked since I am mostly in OOW now.<br />
My belief (and yes, I think too much :) ) is that either [1] Reyfin once retuned from Abysmal Sea with a rune fragment and entrusted it to a friend or gave it to an employer.  Returning to find more fragments, Reyfin goes mad or falls victim to a curse that causes delusions.  Anyway, the friend will probably give us the last fragment in return for items that Reyfin was originally sent to find (like the fang).  Or...[2] Reyfin recieved a new type of powerful rune that could not be converted to a spell.  The power drove him mad and out of fear it was smashed and the pieces scattered.  Two can be foraged and one is in the possession of someone who will trade it for items (again like the fang).</div></div><hr />

I checked Eqranking and there are 2 one a mage 65 on saryrn 7aa and another on quellious is a rog 70 532 aa's same guild as the druid that added Frost to his maglo.<br />
 <br />
Any how if someone did loot was not a druid.<br />
 <br />
As for conorna that quest is a task form the task master in the building next to the mob in Toxx.<br />

As for me, I have Hailed every mob in e/w/n Freeport, n/e/s/w karana,pok,nexus, PK,EP,Halas,Sg,Qeynos hills,RM,LR,TD,OFT,Toxx, natimbi, And others (all Druid guildmasters). I have not got one real good clue.<br />

Asked him, he ask if I had the thick leather bag? I said no where did you get it?He said well you have to forage. I said the bag? what zone? And that I had forged two runes. He said ya those. I asked where turn in? no answer. I asked please I just need to know the hail mpc. He said let me confirm this with tattle. I said he a rog? No answer. I said are you going to tell me? Just would like to know the frsit hail mpc? He said i'm sorry the officer of the druids specifically told me not to tell anyone.<br />

So seem we turn in the two runes to get the leather bag that leads us to the shards.<br />

I started in Natimbi by the tents. With no luck. I also handed it to indurmer up by where the CBq spawns.. then I went to Madronoa the npc that ports to qvic. From there I went to the Abysmal sea ship. To the best of my ability I handed it to every npc on that ship. Now 2 hours later nothing. Before I gave up for tonight I took a trip to Qinimi and Besana the gravedigger. Also Councilman Sislono in one of the buildings. I then when to Barindu to Gamesh and Apprentice Udranda then the Stoneshifter. Still nothing. <br />
Oh! when I first started this I did start in Surefall,I handed it to everyone in there nothing. I hit Althele in East Karana I even handed them to fang and the guy with her. I did not go to anyother npc in East Karana. So at this point I have turned up nothing but figured I would let you all know so we do not double this effort. <br />
Well, I will move on as I get a chance and let you know who I handed them too. <br />

To the Quellious druids: If you wanna share, then share... if not then well it's your call not ours.<br />
<br />
How they figure it out? No idea...  but it has been rumored that certain Quellious guild receives dev info and a certain Quellious druid also gets dev help. And again, that doesn't help us much progress on this quest. I'm not accusing anyone, but that's what's been rumored, especially from other guilds that used to get dev help too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toprem</div><div class="date">11-13-2004, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beleive that what I found is part of our epic 2.0. But it is later or a sub quest part of it. The quest is called A knowledgeable druid. It says it starts in Toxxulia Forest. The information on it is really none. But says Npc north west corner by the water. Need name and loc. Well the name is Assistant T'os Loc is +2112 +1630. I hailed her. She said, I can't talk right now. So I went to PoK to the druid Guild Master. I hailed him. He gives me text but nothing is in [type] brackets. I will go back and ask a few more questions. It then says go to the entrance to Warrens. In stonebrunt. There is a npc there. He tells me what many npc's say I am waiting for someone important. Which is not me. LoL! Then to FV there is an npc there also. He is also talked about in this little discription. His name is Jithanderan Runeseeker. Sorry did not get location on him. He will also not talk when hailed. I did try handing him the rune fragment on at at time then together but nothing. He did give them back to me. <br />
I think the reason I feel it is part of our epic is because of the name of the quest. And also that Jithanderan's last name is runeseeker.<br />
So this is my feedback that I have. <br />
Will it help I do not know. But some how I think it is part of this.<br />

Hailing or giving him me epic 1.5, the noc fang and/or the rune fragments didn't do anything, but when i asked him about Reyfin Malakwa he said:<br />
Mighty this place must have been, once. Now scarred by hatred and suffering. I have been sent here seeking answers to problems not yet understood.<br />
What answers:<br />
A great evil walks across the land. The hand of some demon we don't yet know is twisting and polluting forests.<br />
What evil:<br />
If I knew that, I wouldn't be here looking for answers. I would be elsewher, looking for solutions. For know, I suspect much but know little.<br />
What do you suspect:<br />
The lands are changing, Beasts, large and small, have turned upon those who watched over them. Druids and rangers, worshippers of both Karana and Tunare have reported a feeling of hatred through out their once peaceful lands.<br />
What changes:<br />
Aye. Change. Almost as if.... an old rival had returned to settle a promise.<br />
 <br />
I couldn't remember  if this was what he said to start epic 1.0. The only thing i found back in my notes was to say what action to him to get the note.<br />
 <br />
So maybe one of you guys can tell me if this is for epic 1.0 or maybe a clue for epic 2.0<br />

<br />
another factor we should consider is that Reyfin gives you a pleading look...<br />
<br />
Check out the drawings. I made 3 because the direction of the rods is not specified, also didnt draw a line at the base of the arc, but just assume it.<br />
<br />
Notice how he changes his drawing when you give him a rune (in bold):<br />
<br />
this is when you hail him:<br />
Reyfin Malakwa stares silently out over the ocean towards the magical wards protecting the ship from the unyielding onslaught of the pounding waves. He jumps back terrorized when he realizes your presence. His visage calms a bit when he senses you mean him no immediate harm. He ponders you timidly for a moment and then leans down and begins drawing something in the sea grime that covers one of the boxes. You study his sketch for a moment and begin to understand that it is a rune of sorts. Three arching lines join in the center to form a sort of Y-shape. <br />
<br />
next you give him any rune including chaos rune (could be wrong, took it from journal):<br />
Reyfin Malakwa shuffles back from you until familiarity dawns on him. You reach forward and hold the stone out in front of you. He tilts his head slightly and studies the stone for a moment before taking it from your hands.<br />
<br />
Reyfin Malakwa holds the symbol up over his head and speaks out over the dark waters. He begins to recite some sort of ritual as the runes begin to drip a sticky-looking fluid down on to his hands and arms. The rune begins to glow, softly at first, but it becomes brighter as Reyfin's voice rises. Suddenly, the symbol sublimates into a hovering mass of glowing vapor. Reyfin turns to you and beckons. You hold out your hand and receive the glowing vapor. Almost immediately the vapor solidifies into a familiar shape. Reyfin bends down and begins drawing in the grime once again. You see a pair of jagged lines crossing in the center. <br />
<br />
Lore on Chaos Runes:<br />
Item Lore: Two jagged lines cross in the center<br />
<br />
Lore on all 3 Taelosian Geomancy Stones:<br />
Item Lore: Three arching lines form a Y in the center<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anka</div><div class="date">11-14-2004, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A swirl isn't necessarily a spiral, in fact I'd think of it as any continuous line drawing  which may or may not loop over itself any number of times, or any shape a snake could coil in maybe. A smudged line could also be a swirl but it's unlikely in context. The branches could be spread out like an birds foot but a __/___/___/__/ arrangement would also fit the description. An arch is probably going to be close to a semi-circle shape but could also be any smaller arc of an ellipse.<br />
<br />
I'd guess that the rune fragements are the first part of the quest and that all the bits will be found or quested in the front zones of GoD.</div></div><hr />

 turn in the blasted stone to the stone collector in the smithing-building in nedarias landing and you get washed blasted stone back, i posted this in the epic 1.5 thread when we we're looking for clues, what this is used for is still not figured out (or at least not posted).<br />

 you can sell the washed blasted stone to the same guy for 1plat, perhaps he is looking for another more interesting stone and this is a dead end, tho.</div></div><hr />

 Go to Targen Stonefall in Nedaria's Landing<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'Hail, Targen Stonefall'<br />
 Targen Stonefall says 'Hello there, Gamli. I hope you fare well in your travels. I've decided to settle in here, next to the warm fires of the smithy rather than visit the plane of discord again. It's nasty, but is certainly has some [interesting stones].'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'what interesting stones'<br />
 Targen Stonefall says 'Well, I've been hearing about stones that have inherent power, much like those that we've been calling augmentation stones. These are cruder and you'd have to talk to someone else about exactly how to work with those. I'm more of a geologist myself. I study the way earth and stone are formed. I think there's a lot we can learn about this place from the formation of the [native stones].'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'what native stones'<br />
 Targen Stonefall says 'Just about any of them, really. I've seen most of what can be found, but if you see anything interesting, please let me look at it. You never know what gems you might find! Best of luck to you, my friend.'<br />
 <br />
 Give him Blasted Stone<br />
 <br />
 Targen Stonefall looks carefully at the stone. He takes out a cloth and some liquid and rubs the stone thoroughly. 'Why do you waste my time, friend? This is a rock from Norrath. I suppose it's kind of you to bring it to me, you probably didn't know any better, but I can't do anything with this. Where did you find this?<br />
 <br />
 You recieve Washed Blasted Stone<br />
 Item Lore: A rough stone of mixed material.<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'bloodfields'<br />
 Targen Stonefall says 'Very interesting. I tell you what, I'll buy that stone from you if you want. How about a plat for it? No sense arguing, that's as much as I'll offer.'<br />
 <br />
 If you hand him Washed Blasted Stone:<br />
 <br />
 Targen Stonefall says 'Thank you. This will make a nice trinket for my son's rock collection.'<br />
 You receive 1 platinum from Targen Stonefall.</div></div><hr />

oh and im not sure this is of any importance either but Targen Stonefall responds to odus when he asks where you got the stone from, says something like, &quot;we know where all the important rocks from there come from&quot;<br />

<br />
(1) Taelosian Geomancy Stone Eril , Taelosian Geomancy Stone Jelki , and Taelosian Geomancy Stone Yiktu are all size: tiny<br />
<br />
(2) Reyfin Malakwa gives out the Ragged Cloth Bag which has 3 slots with capacity: tiny , after all he is the spell rune turn in guy, maybe they thought that was all we needed to work on<br />
<br />
(3) this is epic 2 so the difficulty in getting those 3 runes would be very high for most and would account for people not getting all of them in a timely manner<br />
<br />
has anyone been able to collect all three runes and hit combine on the bag yet? i read through every page to make sure nobody has already posted about getting all three runes and hitting combine on the bag and it seems nobody has updated us on a failure yet.<br />
<br />
i would suspect that once the bag is full he might send us to the next quest NPC or give us another bag to collect those different shards. after all a whole lot of collecting was done in epic 1.5</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've seen a lot of talk about needing to collect GoD spell runes, which I hope is not rtue as I've only gotten one spell from that expansion so far.  I was thinking though, has anyone tried combining any of the OoW runes instead?  Reyfin seems to start talking about GoD rune patterns but then goes to talk about something more complex.<br />
From memory - I seem to recall that a muramite rune pattern resembles a swirl, and either the lesser or minor rune looks kinda like a line with 4 branches off of it.  If I seem to recall, they are size &quot;tiny&quot; as well.  I have not had much time or luck in confirming this, but I have not seen mention of it here, so I thought I would throw it out.</div></div><hr />

Although I have not yet completed my 1.5 (guild is currently epic crazy at the moment and epic fights are sometimes hard to schedule) and haven't even thought about starting my 2.0, I can't help but follow along this thread as I did the 1.5 in the hope that someone here is lucky enough to crack the current riddle (though the chances are beginning to look slim on this one :(). <br />
I would however like to post something I messed around with today as a combine with the muramite runes. Since I can't attempt this... I thought I would post a pic and see if one of you would like to give it a shot. I was thinking that maybe the design Reyfin talkes about (&quot;...an arch with rods protruding from either side at the base. The rod to the right splits into four branches, the one on the left ends in a swirl.&quot;) was the design that spread across all 3 of the items placed in the bag. Now, I don't know how the slots in the bag are arranged so I could be WAY off here, but guessing that the slots are 2 above and 1 below... I arranged 3 of the muramite runes and they look kind of like what the design Reyfin describes (not in a stick figure drawing like what we've all come up with but a little more abstract and intricate). Maybe the runes need to be placed in the bag in a certain order. I know it's far fetched but I figured looking at some of these posts that maybe it was worth a try. I hope it helps just a little.<br />

** EDIT.. BTW These are the Muramite Rune, Ancient Muramite Rune and Minor Muramite Rune. Was also thinking the Glowing Muramite Rune could possibly be used in place of the Ancient.</div></div><hr />
