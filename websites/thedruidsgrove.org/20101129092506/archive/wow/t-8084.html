<br />
I am playing on server 27 right now, well not right now I am at work, but I just picked up skinning one of my trade skills.  I was thinking about taking Leatherworking as my second.  This seems to be a logical path since I can only wear leather armor.  Does anyone know if can use the skins you get from animals if you can use those to make the leather armor?  Has anyone started making armor yet?  If so, is it very difficult?  I am just trying to get a feel for that I am getting into..hehe :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I saw, you could get most of the components from skinning, along with a few things (thread and salt, I think?) that you need from the vendor.  However, it was hard for me to keep my skill high enough that I could actually make armor that I could use at my current level.  Mostly I just bought what I wore from a vendor, though there were a few things I crafted for myself.  I think if you put a lot of time into raising skill, it might be a viable way to make your own armor at lower levels.</div></div><hr />

Some of the higher end armor takes 3-4 components to make, but most of those items will drop for you or can be bought at a trade vendor. So far, I haven't had any problems at all, but that could be luck.<br />
<br />
Some of the items you get as quest rewards will be better than what you can make, which is nice. You can also make a little cash on the side if you sell your handmade items to other players. I tend to be lazy, so just sell the stuff I make for skill points back to vendors or give them to friends.<br />
<br />
Edit--I personally tend to avoid buying from vendor NPCs because the prices are pretty steep, and the combination between needing money for spells/abilities and durability pretty much takes care of my cash. However, that certainly is an option if you have the funds to do so :-)</div></div><hr />

It follows along the ranger/druid philosophy of not wasting anything.  <br />
<br />
They only allow you two primary skills so you could either do Skinning/Leather or take up mining/smithing if you need it or Herbalist/Alchemist.</div></div><hr />

I've been doing Skinning/Leatherworking and that seems to work fairly well, it's a bit difficult as a night elf to start out since Tedrassil only has 1 type of creature that can be skinned; stalkers.  But once you reach around level 12 and move to Darkshore there's lots of skinnables.  Mostly I've seen Druids with either Skinning/Leathercrafting or Herbalism/Alchemy, though I have seen the rare Enchanter.  Personally I don't much like alchemy as I normally forget to use potions or can't find them when I need them.  If you are a Nightelf and you want cooking you need to get fishing fairly early since darkelf lands don't have any wolves or boars which are needed for the generic early cooking, they do have eggs but they aren't the easist things to get so fishing and cooking up the fish seems to be the way to go.</div></div><hr />

Do you remember where you found that recipe?  Thanks for the tip about the fish, I remember that spider leg quest from stress test and it made you want to pull your hair out :).<br />

Edit:  I found it in SW, was able to send money for my little girl over there to buy it but the mail isn't coming back the other direction, tried to send it twice...bleh :)  Anyway, I do know where it is if I can only get it.</div></div><hr />

I had a friend who played alot in beta help me get over to dwarfland and to the windingo (sp?) cave, and even though the monsters were green to gray to me at the time, I spent hours there going to town, getting my skill up over 100.  Since then, darkshore has provided plenty of animals to hunt.  People talk about fishing being broken, but it seems to be that skinning is a license to print money.</div></div><hr />

How do I know if I'm apprentice or journeyman?  Does that level have to be puchased or trained of is it automatic with the level?<br />
<br />
For those of you starting out, here's my suggestion.  Go to Darkshore and chase deer. I went from 0 Skinning to 20 in just about a half hour.  Once you get to 20, you can skin carcasses that people leave laying around of bears and cats around level 14.  This will usually yield Light Leather for you which most of the early recipes require.  I do agree with an earlier poster that the stuff I'm making (with the exception of the armor kits that give you +8 to selected pieces) is less than what I can buy in a store.<br />
<br />
Here's a question on that. My armor rating right now is around 450.  My co-workers who are playing have armor levels well over 800 at lower levels.  Am I doing something wrong or is that just a natural restriction with the Druids?</div></div><hr />

Look at your spells and abilities page.  Under the icon for the profession it will tell you your current rank.  You must train up ranks by finding the appropriate trainer for that rank/skill.<br />

It depends on the class of the character and what type of armor they can wear.  If your coworkers all play mail/plate types then your armor class will naturally be lower than there's while in leather.  Leather adds more armor than cloth.  Also check your armor class while in bear form, bear form and dire bear form (level 40) give bonus's to armor class that will up your ac considerably, and properly geared with +ac armor it will make you equal to a similar level mail/plate wearer.</div></div><hr />
