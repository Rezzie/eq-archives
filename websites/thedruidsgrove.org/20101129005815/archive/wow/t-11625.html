If you crit chance is 33% every third hit you do 210% instead of 215%. We can still do really good damage in cat form.</div></div><hr />

The main thing which was hit was our damage output in bear form.  I tanked shattered halls Tuesday night with no problems.  I had no problems keeping aggro on one mob, or multiple mobs.  Multi-mobs were a shade harder to deal with, but not horribly.<br />
<br />
I haven't even noticed the crit damage reduction in cat form at all.  I haven't played a hell of a mount in cat form since the patch though.<br />
<br />
I actually like the new lacerate a lot.  It goes a small amount of high threat damage immediately, along with the bleed.  It makes it useful against bleed-immune mobs.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried tanking an instance with mostly bleed immune mobs... we'll see how it goes next time I tank the first boss in Mechinar.<br />
<br />
I suspect it won't be a problem.  With the threat bonus to mangle, it should hopefully be putting out the same threat.<br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, in PvE tanking, who cares about damage... we care about threat.</div></div><hr />
