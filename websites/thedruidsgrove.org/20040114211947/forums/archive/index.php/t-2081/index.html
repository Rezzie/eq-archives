<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Celyka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember reading about spawning Jale a long time ago, but my searches here have not come up with anything here.  Sorry if this is a rehash.<br />
<br />
Decided to pay the hermin in SK a visit.  He's now outside of his house with 2 wolf pups on each side of him.  Triggered Jale by saying 'I want to become an unkempt druid'.  Jale came running up to the house and he was warmly to me.  Hailing him did nothing, but I could train with him.  Then he just despawned on me.<br />
<br />
Decided I would try and attack him the next time.  Bad idea, he outran me and hit me up in the 300 range.  Had to exodus out.<br />
<br />
Has anyone actually killed Jale or tried to with a force on hand?  Just curious if anyone has had any further success with this.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Colcannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There was a thread a while back (started by yours truly- cannot seem to find it now) talking about Jale after he was &quot;fixed&quot; and the various things we tried<br />
<br />
Someone (Tils?) said they killed him, but he dropped nothing and caused some bad faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Synshade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just another example of half-assing fixes by SoE...  Jale responds to absolutely nothing positive.  I'm Ally with him, so maybe it takes max ally to get anything out of him, but somehow I doubt it.  A druid enemy of his, Gash Flockwalker in Qeynos (related to another assassin quest) is supposed to drop something of value for a broken quest, but he never does either.  I wish they'd give some attention to this faction - Unkempt Woods is long overdue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup was me.<br />
<br />
Nice big faction hits and didnt drop or nothing happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
I went i think if i remeber amiable with him to dubious.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone know an easy way to fix unkempt faction....without destroying another good one? :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Celyka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info everyone, too bad it seems broken still.  I have no idea why I'm warmly to begin with so I am not sure on the faction work needed.  I thought he was an enemy.  I had killed that hermit so many times I thought I was KOS to unkempt druids.  But I'm warmly with the hermit now and no idea why.</div></div><hr />
