This will affect the following TDG Network sites:<br />
<br />
 EQI: eq.thedruidsgrove.org<br />
 EQII: eq2.thedruidsgrove.org<br />
 WoW: wow.thedruidsgrove.org<br />
 Vanguard: van.thedruidsgrove.org<br />
<br />
During this upgrade, you may experience some hick-ups. This is completely normal...we hope. We'll let you know when it's all completed.<br />
<br />
Update / PS: This update is going to include software updates behind the scenes. That means even more can brake. 0.o<br />
<br />
Planned updates will be:<br />
 - Updating Apache from 1.3 to 2.2<br />
 - Updating PHP from PHP4.0.x to 5.2.5 (or what ever version it lets me update to).<br />
 - Updating vBulletin to version 3.6.8</div></div><hr />

Thanksgiving is an overrated holiday anyways. If you need only 1 day to be thankful in your life, gg @ you anyways! (Not saying celebrating it is a bad thing ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have successfully updated the sites to Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.2.5. If anybody experiences ANY problems, please let me know immediately!<br />

PHP4 Users<br />
If you use PHP4, die in a vat. Okay, just kidding. ;)<br />
PHP4 extension is now .php4. It will not be supported within 6 months. Why? Because PHP, themselves, are dropping official support for PHP4 on Dec 31st. After that, PHP4 will no longer receive updates and will no longer be available. I will be more than happy to keep it around for a short time longer. But honest, as a PHP developer myself, nobody should be on PHP4 still. If you are, update because I will pull the plug. :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

The update to vB has been postponed. It has come to my attention that vB is on the verge of releasing 3.7. They had it out, for a short period of time, then pulled it. Once it's officially out again, I'll use that as the primary version to update to.</div></div><hr />
