<br />
But you can have the owls, parrots, cats, Mr Wiggles etc etc that any person can have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sry to say this but Harrasment by ur son... i think that is what my mom would say... i spent 2years tell/beg her to start playing WoW...<br />
<br />
And just a note.. <br />
its Night Elves not Dark Elfs..<br />
i fixed that for u becuase Blood Elves are coming to the game and it can get confusing.<br />
<br />
Hunters and Warlocks can get pets druids cant..<br />
<br />
Hunters get cool pets and warlocks gets ugly pets... and their Imp yells at u...<br />
<br />
Hunters get pets at lvl 10 from a quest..<br />
Warlocks get the Imp at a lvl 1 quest (i think) i would do the quest till ur lvl 3 thou..<br />
<br />
Druids only get critter pets... u can buy them from places and u can get a chicken from a quest..<br />
<br />
u can get an owl critter from Darnassus.. for 50s and can be less for having good rep..<br />
<br />
Chicken quest u have to do /chicken a couple times to a chicken untill u can talk to it.. get a quest from him that tells u to buy special Chicken feed from a guy.. he spells out the name of the guy and the guy is in westfall... u have to find the house that has a farm out in front with a lot of Harvest Watchers which are lvls 14-15 and near the door is the game u buy the chicken feed from.. he DOES NOT have a tellow question mark.. and after u have the specail chicken feed go to a chicken and type /chicken a couple times to finish quest.. then  he drops a egg (which is bigger than the chicken) u open it and take the egg... once its in ur pack u right click it and u have ur own little chicken following u.. but does no damage.. <br />
<br />
same with the owl except u only have to buy it and use it..<br />
<br />
there is a lot more pets in the game soo just look out for them.. :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</div></div><hr />
