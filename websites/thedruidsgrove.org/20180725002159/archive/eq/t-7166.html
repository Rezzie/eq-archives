<br />
Charmed all the way through my 50s, favorite spots, roughly in order that I hunted them:<br />
<br />
TD Raptors (could almost clear both islands clear) <br />
Chardok (my home for many levels)<br />
Maidens Eye (ravenous beast vs. toilers)<br />
Plane of Disease (rats vs. flies)<br />
Plane of Nightmare (birds/stalkers)<br />
<br />
<br />
All of those were GREAT experience for the level.   Now at 63 they all, well, suck, due to both level of mobs and charm nerf.   The spots I'm playing in now:<br />
<br />
Nadox<br />
- Great spot, tough pets (that dual wield!) unlimited blue con mobs.   Lower mob level means decent kill rate but lower exp per hour than before.<br />
<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
- Frogs.  Great xp per mob....and only one druid per server can charm these at a time.  Not usually an option.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief<br />
- Almost always only one in the zone....VERY easy, flat ground, plenty of dark blue mobs that die fast, abundant supply of pets (including some charmable with pre-CoT charm).  Lower level and lower zone modifier, but amount and ease of kills makes it somewhat worthwhile.  Hear it goes light blue at 65. <br />
<br />
Any other spots?  I know tactics is charmable but I'm not flagged for there yet.  Any advice on pros/cons of certain locations would be helpful as well.  I know some zones (WW, Sirens Grotto, maybe DN or UP?) have charmable animals but theres usually some drawback that makes it not worthwhile to exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I get better exp in groups, and I also do the quadding and root/rotting thing in HoH.  But I like charming for sentimental reasons, and I truly find it more fun to do if I'm going to solo than anything else.  Plus I went to the trouble of getting my Sand Eroded Shell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=40221) I'd like to take advantage of it more often. :)</div></div><hr />

However, aggro ranges might make it difficult - at 65, I can basically waltz through the zone unhindered.  I doubt that would be the case at a level where you'd actually be getting XP.</div></div><hr />

Scirocco!!!! Enlighten this druid!!!<br />
<br />
Its possible to charm in povalor.  Some interesting charming to be done in GoD as well, if you have that expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">04-02-2004, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone mention charming?  Here are some options (leaving out DC'able mobs)<br />
<br />
PoV: Charm a frog (some are snareable) and take it to kill golems, etc.  I used one to get the sacred waters from the armored guys for the Aid Grimel quest (did it twice over, in fact).<br />
<br />
PoS: Loroks are not limited to lorok v. lorok combat, although many folks think so.  Take that lorok and go kill giants at any of the 3 camps.  Or take it to the front cave and use it on the frogs there.  Heck, I used a lorok to kill the bees, too.<br />
<br />
Natimbi: Lots of people have been charming there.  Too low level for me.<br />
<br />
Tipt and Vxed:  Some of the hynids are level 60 (many are not, though).  Charm one of these little monsters, haste it, and go to town.  In fact, the time I completed Tipt for the first time, I charmed the hynid right at the very beginning and took it all the way to the end.</div></div><hr />

You probably need exodus but if you're up for a challenge then that's a good one.</div></div><hr />

Been focusing on getting 65 more than AA, so it's a matter of time.  It would help to know what mobs in PoV summon though.  I know (painfully) that non-frogs in PoS do. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So get exodus already.  And then quick evac 3.  I use the latter far more than exodus for dealing with summoning mobs in those situations.   Quick Evac 3 doesn't have a reuse timer...:)</div></div><hr />

I am currently level 53 with about 127 cha and I am considering starting charming. I have a few gear slots I can work with to add cha, so I am wondering if I should pursue that strategy. I just read on the enchanter board that cha/10 equals a MR reduction modifier on charms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used Charm in Nurga thru 63 (I'm 64 now, still doing AA), I have not been back for awhile but I believe most in the back would still be Dark blue.  Normally I would have two or three mobs parked on my DS'd pet at a time, AA wasn't bad.  Casters are all over in there, but with good resists their spells don't land often.  Named loot wasn't worth much, but the Tribute Masters would give 1000 or so points for the items.<br />
<br />
I love to charm in PoM, the Fetid skunks make a very nice pet and chew thru everything I've tried.  In the yard, only the named summon.  I'll take a skunk up on the wall and just inside the castle to kill the Rascals (they don't summon).  They hit harder / it's a little slower, more time healing my pet.  I have charmed the gorilla at the top of the stairs, but he spends too much time casting for my like.  Still funny to shrink him though  :) <br />
<br />
In WW, with proper strat - you can charm and kill Iceburrowers.  I also kill anything not on Dragon faction in there.  WW is a PITA though if you like to snare you pet, or if there is more than two farmers.  Normally I'll DC in there if I can find one<br />
<br />
Recently, I have been killing in PoJ caves with DC.  Just use caution if NOT using DC, it can get ugly quick.  I like the caves, never run into anyone down there.<br />
<br />
Nadox - fun place if you can get the right boar to spawn, you'll have a very evil pet for whats in there to kill.  Normally I'll just pick up a boar and kill to the lava bridge until the one I want spawns, then I'll take him with me to the luggalds or back by HatesFury.<br />
<br />
Speaking of HatesFury, there are rats in there, but I have had a terrible time getting the first room broke to grab me a rat.  Anyone have success in there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karanthal</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flinty Cragbeasts also make pretty good pets in vxed and tipt.  Although odd times you do get the &quot;mob is too high&quot; message, so I guess their level varies a little.  Without a shammy to malo the charm duration is somewhat limited, but theres lots of room at the entrance fo both zones to kite.<br />
<br />
Best thing about both of these zones is that there instanced so you have the mobs to yourself, and you can keep creating instances until you find an animal near ZI.<br />
<br />
Watch out for mites and dog men(mastruq) which summon, the golems also summon but are probably too far in to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otzberger</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the best way to get into PoM? EQAtlas doesn't have a map of PoM OR ToV. I do have the book Maps of Myrist that shows a general way but nothing on any of those maps says &quot;to level 3&quot; and the map for level 3 only calls it level 3 and not something else.<br />
<br />
Also, how good does your ToV faction have to be to walk all the way through to PoM port without getting killed?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just dinged 63 yesterday and got the new charm spell. PoS frogs seem to be good XP but lots of down time when they are cleared. PoM seems to be a very good option.... unless I get killed.... CR would be very very bad.</div></div><hr />

Go to The Great Divide and succor to the evac spot.  You will see at the end of the river the little entrance to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otzberger</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks very much... will give it a shot now  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otzberger</div><div class="date">04-13-2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I gave it a shot. Pretty much stayed in the woods near zone in. Couldn't figure out how to get inside the castle and took me forever to find the silly invisible bridge. The XP in the courtyard was about 2% AA per kill (if that) using the invis trick to get full XP. Loot pretty much sucked.... biggest drop was 7gold and some rune. Mobs are plentiful there and barely any risk at all of getting killed. Zone in is safe and lots of room to work. Can probably do some quadding there..... didn't think to count the HPs on the mobs. Snare usually stuck on first try regardless if it was a skunk, bee, or mushroom. Tried to kill the named unicorn in the corner (don't ask me why.... I know he's a quest NPC) and that didn't turn out that great... luckily I tried that right as I was leaving. Could probably do the wall too pretty easily (was camped when I was there by a necro) but getting a charmed mob up the invisible bridge could be a problem. Got about 30% AA in a little over an hours time so wasn't too awful bad... just got kind of tedious with the really bad loot.<br />
<br />
I will try again though. I will see if I can get a pet onto the wall and try the humanoid looking things up there. Hear they backstab though. <br />
<br />
Also, how do you get inside?? I went to the door and tried to click in and that didn't work. I also tried both ends of the wall thinking it might be a trick entrance but that didn't work either.<br />
<br />
Laters  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Filobeto</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">POM is full of &quot;fun&quot; things.....clicking in certain areas or on certain items will port you to another spot (which can be VERY bad).  Invis walls in lots of places, one of which will get you into the castle.  Some walls are one way.<br />
<br />
Don't venture too far solo unless you have exodus and a necro friend.<br />
<br />
As far as poopy loot....some research items = cash, if you can have them converted to spells = more cash.  Lots of uncommon and some very rare research stuff can be found there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harvey the dog</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nadox, inside hates fury, the answer is no.  there is no way to break that first room reliably, unless you are into zoning a lot.  one thing you can try is to snare and root the rodens, zone out, zone back in, charm rodent and wait for root to break and sick him on one of the guys inside.  root any mobs the rat is on and pray.  if you can kill one of those first two guys, your good to go.  be prepared to spend a lot of mana healing your pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BogebogbudicusRZ</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I break the first room all the time. Snare on right corner rat, then click pants right away. This, 7 times out of 10, puts a rat, snared and rooted, right in the doorway. Then I buff said rat, and root the next mob in line on the right. His buddy runs over and I put rat on him. Snaring and rooting him as well. I make sure I get a snare on the first mob I rooted so he doesn't run over and cruch my head too fast if root breaks. Same thing on left side ( I leave the far right rat until last in case I need another pet). <br />
With C3, I find that a few debuffs and clickies per mob usually leaves me at about 25 to 30 percent mana with everything in the room dead.<br />
<br />
It's not all that great AA exp-wise though. I find it is safer and less cramped to just charm the exhausted bloodtusk in Nadox and go on a rampage near undead weaponsmith area.</div></div><hr />
