As you can see on lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3297&amp;source=Live), level 1 cures 9 counters of curse/poison/diesease. Haven't had a chance to check out having one of each type on it, but I'd guess it would kill them all at once. It affects your whole group, it will also cure one no counter dot/debuff.<br />
<br />
I did a little testing with it...<br />
<br />
Put ONLY ensnare as a debuff on me.<br />
It will cure it<br />
<br />
Put ONLY winged death.<br />
It will cure it<br />
<br />
Put drones, winged death, epic on ( in that order )<br />
It cures drones<br />
<br />
ONLY epic<br />
Cured<br />
<br />
Ensnare, Fixation, Disjunction, Winged<br />
NOTHING cured.<br />
<br />
I believe in the final case, it was taking some invisible counters off them all, spreading out the &quot;dispel&quot;, so that it was too weak to dispel any of them. I'm not quite sure =-(<br />
<br />
Anyways, just thought i might share a little info about this ability. It costs 2 points for level 1, you can get level 2 a 63 for 4 points. So guessing 65 for level 3, and cost of 6 points.<br />
<br />
Not sure I'll ever get level 3, but ifI do, it will likely be awhile =-)</div></div><hr />

It's a 3 minute re-use, wish it was shorter, since one of the red to 61 guys I fought, had a 36 disease counter AE =-( but still nice</div></div><hr />

Had something use cascading darkness on me... knew I was dead pretty much. But I used radiant cure to cure the darkness, then run a bit and gate. Heal up on the other side, and radiant cure Ignite Blood once it refreshed =-)</div></div><hr />

Perhaps I just misread something, but it only seemed to be curing me last night, and not others who I was grouped with who were also diseased.  Since the hot key reads &quot;Group Cure&quot;, I was kind of boggled...  Not to mention the spell description had me beliving it would effect my groupmates as well.  Anyone having similar problems?  Weird fluke?  I tested range and what I had targeted, but neither seemed to effect the fact it was only effecting me (at the first level anyway).<br />

<br />
I have been trying to get someone on the Lanys cleric board to explain to me what it does exactly .. because .. I often use Remove Curse to take off Curse of the Revenant (Scarlet Desert). It takes one (sometimes 2 casts) and I have 'cured my target'. No problem. However, I can cast it all day long on a group member and it never seems to do anything, although it does not say (nor appear to be) a self-only spell. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if this is bugged or a 'feature' .. and if it is .. sounds as though the same bug or feature .. was incorporated into your ability, perhaps. <br />
<br />
Has anyone else got any explanation .. or .. have you had the same experience with Remove Curse? (Remove Curse only removes 4 counters per cast per curse up to 4 I think, but it is the same principle as Greater I understand).</div></div><hr />

Despite being called &quot;Group Cure&quot; it is only affecting the user.  /bug /feedback it until they get the ability fixed.</div></div><hr />

First confirmation I have had from anyone that what I thought was happening was indeed happening (or, in this case, it is 'not' happening when applied to other people who are cursed).</div></div><hr />

I could only cure me with it.  I'm assuming this wasn't intentional?</div></div><hr />
