Tested the waters and this is just pis-poor in my opinion.  Congrats to people who scored enough CP, now tell me how many aren't Rogues or Hunters on your server.  I thought the system would be nice, and balanced, but the roving system they are using is based on who has the most time to PvP period.  I'm not saying I want the highest rank for my contribution, but from what I have heard and read, you have to reach a certain threshold based on the higherst CP gained in your faction (or maybe it's server wide) by any one person.  Then ranks are decided and handed out based on that.  As Tryen so elequently put it, If 1 person were to pvp, and noone else in their faction does, then theoretically they are the Grand Marshal of the Alliance with access to all the goodies.  That isn't word for word, but pretty much how he compared it in an extreme situation.  <br />

How many other people are satisfied/disatisfied with the way the Talley's turned out?  To me it seems like it's only for the 60's, especially on PvP servers (Seeing as at 60 the only other thing you are worried about is that LBRS, MC, and Onyxia run, and don't need to balanace spending time PvPing and also trying to level.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not overly concerned with rank myself, more the fun of the encounters themselves, so I'm patiently (or impatiently rather) awaiting battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

After 2 days my hunter friend has 2k HKs and i had 300... And we both played around 5 hours max. But i think rogues will get the highest rank first, cause of the CP when they are soloing someone from behind.</div></div><hr />
