<br />
But im still confused (doesnt take much), I do alot of soloing without to much trouble, lov my trees.<br />
But ive always tended to end up as healer for groups/instances, i have dif pants, hat, boots &amp; weapon for healing (bonus just under400 mana re-209), i have just been to mana tombs as boomkin and must admit i didnt realy have a clue (it was odd not having to heal) what should i be looking to do? what is swarm good for? And i tend to favour moon/starfire, it sounds like that might be wrong?<br />
<br />
Also my kit i think is poorish, but i dont seem to pick the right stuff, higher lvl items ive put on have lowered crit or armor etc.. and what health/mana should i have?<br />

Before you hit 70, just whatever drops for you from world mobs, quest rewards, and maybe instances should last you just fine until 70 where you can focus on getting certain pieces.<br />
<br />
While running instances is good and all, don't farm them while leveling to get certain drops unless it's for gear that will last you until you start Heroics/PvP/Raids.</div></div><hr />
