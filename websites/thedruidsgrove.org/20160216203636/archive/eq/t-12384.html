I saw that for DoN they made tradeskill caps 300 and I also read somewhere that they removed level caps for tradeskills?  Not sure if this is accurate but does that mean you can make a lvl 1 alt gnome or lvl 1 shammy and get tinkering/alchemy up to 300 w/o leveling your character?  I have a lvl 11 gnome enchanter w/ tinkering at 50.  I did some combines and didn't skill up at all, was wondering if there is a minimum level on this or if its even true.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

They are however all born with a skill of 50 in it to give them a head start and be able to do some &quot;trivial&quot; combines before then.<br />
 <br />
The big 7 I believe are the only ones referenced when they make generic statements about tradeskills specifically with regards to leveling.<br />
 <br />
Poison Making, Alchemy, Research(now big with DoD release), and Tinkering are limited by class and may have some unique rules/requirements.<br />
 <br />
For anything more in depth I would check over on EQTC.  They are the tradeskill gurus of Norrath (and associated planes/deminsions/moons) and would probably have a more definitive answer.</div></div><hr />

Meaning you can only get 1 tradeskill over 200 to 300, but for the rest you will have to wait for AAs.<br />
<br />
Poison Making and Alchemy are level restricted though, they are class/race tradeskills. They are capped at about 5 skill ups per level.<br />
<br />
Tinkering is only level restricted by the fact that you need lvl 16 to start skilling up...</div></div><hr />

Your shaman just need to meed the minimum level requirement and you can go all the way to 300.</div></div><hr />

So a level 16 gnome is going to be able yo get tinkering 300 but he not be able to get the safety net aa of salvage.<br />
<br />
Same thing for alchemy, poison or spell research.  Just in case anyone is making choices of which character to invest with tradeskills.<br />
