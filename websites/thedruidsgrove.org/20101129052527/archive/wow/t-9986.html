<br />
Something that I have noticed as of late is the talk of hunters being overpowered.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I have never had a problem with hunters.  I tend to beat them and don't have alot of problems with them at all.<br />
<br />
They do have great burst attack with aimed shot, multishot, while an auto-shot goes off in there as well.  But it can't be repeated for 6 seconds (aimed) and 10 seconds (multi).   To me great burst attack doesn't mean they are overpowered.  Warriors, mages, and rogues have great burst attacks as well.  We lack burst dps but make up for in with our healing abilities and awesome armor in bear form.  (Yes, feral cat does have some burst but not on the same level.)<br />
<br />
How does the rest of the druid community feel about hunters being called overpowered?<br />
<br />
Do you think they are overpowered, underpowered, or balanced?<br />
<br />
I say they are balanced.</div></div><hr />

LMAO, that's genius. Sorry to sound callous, but that really made me laugh.<br />

Hunters are not overpowered IMO, the only class I have issues with are those feckless Shamans and their bloody totems. Travel form at Lvl 20?? WTF??? Resurrect at lvl 12??  People moan about everyone when they get ganked in PVP. i only hate shammies because of battleground issues. I have the utmost respect for good Warlocks in PVP as I have REAL issues with mine in PVP, but getting back to topic. <br />
<br />
No, hunters are not overpowered. They have many life saving abilities, but no more than others (Possible exception of Warlocks who have a 2minute* cast fear which can be, and is regularly, resisted)<br />

Rogues have vanish so, its not completely unfair.  But tell me how someone can set a trap while they're pretending to be dead?!!!!  That makes little sense to me.  <br />
<br />
They have many many stun/slowing/disorient tricks up their sleeves.  <br />
<br />
And pets can add dps/tank whatever.  Very annoying for spellcasters.  Try getting a regrowth off w. a pet clawing your face and getting hit with auto shot.  <br />
<br />
I'm not saying they're invinsible.  I can win if I can get a jump on them (or if they're bad) but they are very very very strong.  And is it scorpid sting that sucks mana?  WTF!!?</div></div><hr />

there pet. I think that when a hunter commits there pet to battle they should not be able to withdraw them because you have no choice but to fight them and when they start getting killed all the hunter has to do is back out of range and the pet  will vanish......just waisted alot of energy for nothing! I see alot of high lvl hunters do this and at my lvl most players dont know not to hit pets that are asleep....lol<br />

:confused: I DID NOT KNOW THAT. That sucks!!!! Okay, that might be a little overpowered, but I haven't played a hunter long enough to get feign death yet. Might put a little more effort into it though, cos that sounds cool...for the Hunter.<br />

I don't agree with you there, you can always ignore the pets and concentrate your efforts on getting close to the hunter...too close for them to shoot you. Going from what I took from your post, you think that Warlocks are overpowered too (which is complete :bs: ). I may be wrong, but that is how I read your post.<br />
<br />
I am only speaking from my (limited) experience though, at my lvl (36 - Warlock and 26 - Druid) the pets are relatively insignificant at PVP, they can be controlled in SOOOOOO many ways or, as I said, just ignored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all honesty, every class is very powerful in their own right, regardless of spec.  Although some specs may be better suited for PvP or PvE, individual skill is the key to winning any battle.  <br />
<br />
Myself (59 resto) and friend (60 disc/holy priest) owned two epic'ed out hunters yesterday.  Close fight, but we won.  :wiggle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the hunter feign death + traps.<br />
<br />
Keep a Dot on them and they can't leave combat.<br />
<br />
We have an INSTANT Dot - moonfire.  <br />
<br />
We have no excuse to say the feign death + trap is overpowered when we can prevent it with one button.<br />
<br />
Many also have insect swarm which would do the trick.  <br />
In cat form we have a couple DoTs as well.<br />
<br />
By the way - if a hunter falls over 'dead'.  Don't walk towards him/her.  Stay away from that area.  As they run away feral charge forcing them to melee which is their weaker attack.<br />
<br />
I guess it's hard for me to imagine that a class is overpowered or has an exploit when we can hit 1 key to prevent it all.</div></div><hr />

I never said anything about warlocks so dont try to put words in my mouth.<br />
<br />
I agree with ignoring the pet and getting in the hunters face  but I'm not talking about 1on1 duels here I'm talking about in Battle where alot of times you dont have that option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant stand hunters for the reason that in Gadget, they can kite me a few times, then drop aggro while I get pwned by the guards.  And then when I rezz they do this to me again.  I guess same thing for rogues.  And in pvp, hunters pwn everyone hiding in bushes or barns and kiting ridiculous.  <br />
<br />
Yes, if you keep up a dot on hunter they cannot fd.  Or if they do, they will be popped right out of it next tick.  This is somewhat difficult to do though, as most of the time fighting a hunter you should be in bear form.  Whenever you pop out to heal, you must remember to get at least one dot on him, and re-hibernate or re-root his pet.  Mana permitting, that is.<br />
<br />
Never run straight at hunters.  Good ones will always be standing on or just behind an ice trap.  Hibernate pet, HoT self, dispel viper and scorpid stings on you, strafe to the side a bit, drop into bear and feral charge. <br />
<br />
Hunters are weak if you get to fight them up close in bear form (if feral), or if you are able to get in their dead zone, root them and mf / wrath (if moonkin).  Their dps isnt high enough to counter the huge amount of armor we have, and if they cant hit us, they cant win :p.  Though if you are fighting a good hunter, gl getting close to them.  <br />
<br />
The only overpowered aspect of hunters imo is when their pets are somehow immune to sleep effects.  I understand this is a talent (and I think certain pets are immune), but geeze.  And whoever said &quot;ignore the pet&quot; uh, thats a quick way to lose.  Pets do lots of damage.  A good hunter has so many tricks up his sleeve, being able to take his pet out of the battle gives you a chance.  Otherwise, goodnight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the idea of fighting hunters in bear form.  Most don't realize they have a scare beast spell that works on you in feral forms.<br />
<br />
It's a good strategy for winning.  <br />
<br />
I would much rather fight a hunter than another druid though.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't putting words in your mouth man, as I said, I was only going on how I interpreted your post. I haven't had the pleasure of Hunters other than 1on1 yet with my Druid.<br />
<br />

<br />
As I said at the end of my post, I was only going from my limited experience. As of yet, I am yet to be hurt too much by the pet (not before I've killed the hunter anyway) might be that I have been lucky, I don't know. With my lock, i have a pet of my own anyway, so that kinda sorts out the problem for me.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My friend has a 36 hunter his pet does about 35 damage every 2 seconds. (17.5 dps).<br />
<br />
Hibernate is your best option- if it doesn't work put a couple HoTs on and work on the hunter.<br />
<br />
I would be more worried about the burst dps from the hunter as soon as they get to range than the pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1vs1 Druids still have the edge against hunters... I can run into every ice trap they drop aslong as I'm in bear it really doesn't do anything but prolong their loss.  Same for scare beast... I mean it's not going to break a heal.<br />
<br />
There's no trinkets to break out of an ice-trap, but engineer's frost reflector's will reflect the trap on the hunter.  Not so great in world pvp and duels, but rather powerful when used right in AB and WSG.<br />
<br />
Just like mages and warlocks can re-apply crowd control; I don't find it terribly unfair that hunters can re-apply their traps... CC is generally what seperates good hunters from the rest of the pack imho.  I hate being CC'ed too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When fighting hunters it really depends on the pet they have and how they have applied thier pets talent points.  Its not so much that the pets have great DPS.  Its the fact that the pets interupt / delay casting.  Which when your trying to heal or nuke in caster form it becomes a huge pain.  Currently I'm only 35 if I see pet I sleep it in BG then I drop my HoTs on my self and start to nuke/dot the hunters.  With our heals we can ussually kill a hunter from range +/- 3 levels.  If the hunter drops a viper sting on you dont waste the mana to come out of animal form as it will not drain your many unless your in travel form or caster form.  Let the waste that sting on you as they only can have one at time on you.  Better for it to be useless one then a dot or - stat sting.</div></div><hr />

I just speced to Feral/Resto, Resto for Nature's Focus, IS and Subtlety. I think Nature's Focus is a must. It is very strong. It sorts that interrupts. And just try and avoid the traps. Taking the pet out is key. And when they run away charge them.<br />

We are on a Normal server....but they were flagged and coming after him.  So I figure if I could take him out that once it is saying alot.  <br />

<br />
Cast both dots on them (moonfire and insect swarm) go in travel and run circles around them.  This makes them really mad and they will eventually die.  You have enough mana to do this multiple times.  (keep fierie fire on them just in case).</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I know this is a hunter thread, this should be moved)<br />
<br />
He is a really good rogue I must add and 2 lvls higher than I am. 50+ at the moment. I won two fights straight against one 2 lower than me, 51 and 49 at the time. Had 3/4 health at the end felt pretty good :)<br />
<br />
So now I'm wondering if it's just my friend that is really good, and his mad gear(with Shadowblade)...<br />
<br />
In duals you can't do that DoT very easy. So I'll have to wait to 58 to really try that in BG.<br />
<br />
On the hunters again. Keep that pet away, and DoT on them. Then kick their head in with bear when they are running. With Hunters, Mages and Priests, heal yourself when they start with the explosive dmg. Mages oom so fast and then they are dead. Hunters get scared when they see you're not dieing and they are loosing health, then they run. Must say that MF+IS gives some nice dmg for little mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otherwise when the duel bgins put a HoT on yourself hit Natures Grasp and bear up.  He'll stealth and jump you from behind but with bear you shouldn't have any trouble survivng the initial barrage, maybe crank out a roar on him and FF.  Now he should be rooted or asleep. Shift to caster to heal up, hit him with a the Dots, then go bear again.  In a little while use a bash-heal if necessay.  really shouldn't be any problem, after the initial wave the bulk of their burst dps is out, especially if you can keep the FF and DoT on him to prevent another stealth attack.</div></div><hr />

Rogues love to use a spell called blind which incapacitates you and allows them time to bandage themselves, or just get their energy bar back up.  If you have abolish poison working away for 8 sec, you will cancle the blind effect should they hit you with it.<br />
<br />
Whenever dueling a rogue, I cast HoT amd Abolish Poison on myself, NG, make sure to have thorns aura, then bear up to take the initial damage.  I only have 1 point in NG, so it takes about 5 hits or so for the roots to proc.  Make sure to keep FF up on them, and a demoralizing roar.  Basically everything that gwmort said.<br />

Worse comes to worse you get hit and they feign death and it's over.  If you attack you will die by the guards and they will laugh.<br />

A little off topic - I had an alt I was playing on the other day in Gadgetzan and a shadowpriest would cast whatever it is they cast on me and I would die before the guards could kill her.  She did it about 10 times.  It was frustrating for me because if I hit her guards would kill me.  If I did nothing, I would die before the guards could kill her.</div></div><hr />
