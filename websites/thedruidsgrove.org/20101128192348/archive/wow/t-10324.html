<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onyko</div><div class="date">03-25-2006, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a level 48 Druid, first time through WoW, and I'm trying to get my fishing skill up. After about four or five hours its finally  about 16something, and I'm trying for artisan later on. I can't find any good places to fish though without having the catch about a dozen before getting a point. Anyone know of a good place that won't take up quick so much of my time for my skill level? I don't want to waste anymore time and money by checking somewhere and not having a high enough skill, done that plenty of times already. <br />
<br />
Also, where can I find stonescale eels? I think someone mentioned Winterspring to me once, but I'm hesitant if not unwilling to go up there to farm them. I need it for better defense potions. And what pole would all you seasoned fishermen reccomend? I'm currently using  Nat Pagle's Extreme Angler FC-5000.</div></div><hr />

Teldrassil, Darnassus, Darkshore, Ashenvale, Desolace, Feralas (I think that's how I did it).  It doesn't really go fast though, you just have to have a lot of patience.<br />

As for the eels:<br />

I have 2 lvl 60 horde that are both 300skill fishing.<br />
<br />
Make sure you use lures when your fishing skill is not very high. This will help a huge amount.<br />
<br />
I would fish mainly in the barrens, ratchet and south of ratchet.  Try to fish in the oilyblack mouth fishing holes.  You can make a lot of money while you lvl your fishing.  **Your fishin will continue to go up even if you fish in lower lvl areas.  I.e., you don't have to find higher lvl zones to increase your skill because it moves at the same slow pace regardless.<br />
<br />
I personally would que for WSG, fly to barrens and fish for Oily Blackmouth, then go WSG, then fish, WSG, fish, etc.  Free action pots rule.<br />
<br />
The link that Yrys provided is great for Stonescale eels. I have always fished for them in the Bay of Storms (Aszhara).  However, you need a skill of 400+ to consistantly catch fish - vice &quot;your fish got away&quot;.  Only fish there at night: midnight or later when the %catch is the best.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

<br />
And thats a good idea, too, Bulldoser. I was considering joining up with my guild and working on my rank so that combination would be a good time saver.</div></div><hr />
