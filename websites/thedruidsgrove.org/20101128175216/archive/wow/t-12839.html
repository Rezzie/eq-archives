Someone linked it somewhere on TDG but I can't remember where.  :&gt;<br />

Someone reference the druid nerfs in BC. I think this was partially the reason for them (as well as bears being able to do a lot of dps as bears, IIRC). We don't think druids NEED to choose bear or cat. But it would be nice if you had the option of choosing bear &gt; cat or cat &gt; bear. Going that route lets us justify your being an awesome tank (because you're giving up some dps) or vice versa. I don't think anyone is arguing (I hope) that all Ferals with any spec need to be as good at tanking as prot warriors and as good at dps as rouges just by shapeshifting and swapping gear. I think we all know the outcome of such a design. But there is a difference between &quot;as good as rogues&quot; and &quot;worth bringing on a raid.&quot; <br />
