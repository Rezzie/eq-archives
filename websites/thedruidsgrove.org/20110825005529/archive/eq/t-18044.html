I'd say 7/10 Druids think things are looking up in the DPS department, and that's just my impression.  The reason for gains against melee is faster casting nukes and double nukes through Twin Cast - which Mages and Wizards also got.  Real healers like Druids are highlly sought after in raids, but nearly fogotten in groups due to mercs.  If you are coming back, I hope you have a group of friends waiting for you or might be frustrated while leveling up to 85.</div></div><hr />

While we may deserve some nerfage, essentially halving the WF damage is going to be pretty brutal. (that is what it's like on Test server atm)<br />
