I still need to find &quot;Chunk of Broken Ancient Stone Worker &quot;. Alla's indicates that this only drops from golems in Ikky4 and Inktu'ta. Since I'm sure our guild won't be going back there any time soon (or ever), please say I can get these from other golems somewhere! (I have had no luck in the Bazaar either).</div></div><hr />

<br />
check what guilds currently are working on that content.  then send tells to guild members and ask for an officer (which then can point you to a banker).  ask if they have any in their guild bank.  <br />
<br />
Try to ask your friends, if they have friends, who know this guy, etc.  I'm sure somebody, somehwere has this collecting dust.<br />
<br />
in the meantime, create a hotkey WTB chunk of stone. and hit it when you are in pok/bazaar.  you could always try to setup a /buyer</div></div><hr />
