I hear that, all the 60 instances seem so bleak and depressing (Strat, Scholo, UBRS/LBRS, BRD, MC, AQ's, etc...).  I really miss getting to go through some more visually appealling places like Mara (has to be prettiest instance).</div></div><hr />

But it seems all horde become morons  when entering there, it's like it's a full-fledged warzone sometimes. Nowhere else have I (a 35-ish druid) been slaughtered by a group of 60's just passing me by on the road. And there's almost always a few waiting at Nesingwary's. :mad:. <br />
<br />
Just a guess, but are those of you who love STV playing on PvE or RP servers? :p</div></div><hr />

PvE was fun but with PvP some sort of weird drug gets released there that gives Horde and Alliance alike a weird debuff that causes them to actively seek out and kill everyone they see on the road.</div></div><hr />

Fun to see that the &quot;STV disease&quot; is spread throughout whole WoW, no matter faction or server. :D But yeah, the place is beautiful and very &quot;gank-friendly&quot;.

<br />
With regards to thottbot, i have never had any problems with the coords provided, so i cannot comment. It was a great help throughout all my STV days.<br />
<br />
As for beauty, I really liked Un'Goro Crater even on a PVE server, i was always on edge, never knowing when a stray Devilsaur might turn up to gank me. I was so happy skinning them and selling what i got from the AH though, so we had a symbiotic relationship :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm lvl 53 now, so I've had the chance to run Mara a few times.  Definitely my favorite instance so far.  The Orange side is pretty tough, but I like it anyway.  (This is coming from someone who enjoys the battle on the stairs in ZF, so take it with a large grain of deeprock salt.) :sumo:</div></div><hr />

i can imagine it being a nightmare on a PvP realm though, luckily i play on Azjol-Nerub, AKA the carebear server :)</div></div><hr />
