Add clerics to your list, because there are times when they pull as well.  :)  Personally, I usually swap monks, bards, and SKs in and out of groups as pullers.  <br />
 <br />
Druids can be GREAT pullers in some places, like PoFire - druids and necros rule that zone.  In any other zone flagged as outdoors druids can also pull with relative ease, but you need to make sure of a few things: you have sow/soe on so you don't get caught, you pull with a non-damage spell so you don't get summoned, and you have a tank with good quick aggro ability.  Snare pulling can help a lot with this; it does no damage, pulls the mob, and allows you to easily outrun it.  If mobs are far away, pull with some other spell and snare them when they get close to camp, then just run in tight circles around the group until the tank has aggro.<br />
 <br />
Druids pulling in indoor zones is generally a bad idea unless mobs are very spread out, because root will be your only form of crowd control until all the mobs you aggroed are in camp (where maybe you have a mezzer).</div></div><hr />

The suggested spells for pulling I would say are for GoD, OOW, or DoN is dispell, or hand of ro, but I prefer dispell. It's a low agro spell, wich means the tank can take agro off you very fast, it's also a spell that will dispell their haste, most of the mobs in the new expansions are hasted or have some type of buffs. I use my box monk now when I have to pull though.</div></div><hr />

Pull the snared mob(s) through the camp and park them behind me.  The people I group with have had other pullers but they always prefer me because I don't sit there for 5 minutes trying to split pull singles, instead I keep mobs coming and we usually do pretty well.

As previously stated we are less than an ideal puller in most situations unless your tank has good snap aggro your gonna die a time or two.  (depending on your gear vs. content your pulling)<br />
 <br />
Not that I am anywhere need a good puller or root CC'er anymore.  Those skills have fadded over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the zone layout.  Zones with a lot of open room druids can do well with.  Our pulling abilities in tight areas aren't too good in current content, one reason being that most zones are indoor flagged now, and NS doesn't lower aggro radi to PCs anyways.</div></div><hr />

And you don't have to have insane HP like Phal does to pull this way either. One of the main problems I encounter when trying to CC/pull a nest mission, is that the rest of the group has no idea what to do when I get 1-3 adds, and everyone attempts to deal with it themselves. (I laughed when I pulled 3 mobs, by the time they were back to camp, the MA had one, the ranger was casting to aggro on the other, and the bard was trying to mez 2. They didn't realise I had already rooted the 2 that the MA wasnt on.) Druid pulling/crowd control is very VERY under-rated and under-apreciated. Especially at res/sum camp in RS.</div></div><hr />

here's the great thing about druids tej, our jobs are never boring. if you're the best class out of the six to pull, pull. i was pulling hard ldons (read: indoor zone) long before I was a raider, with barely 4k buffed hps. as long as you're smart about it, you can pull just about anywhere and cc those adds. your role is whatever role makes you the best fit for the group you're in. that's the druid's best trait, versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tips for pulling.<br />
1) Outdoor zone? Use Harmony<br />
2) Not a lot of wanderers? Can snare-pull them to give the tank more time to get aggro<br />
3) With wanderers around, can use burst of flame or similar low level spells for low aggro pulls<br />
4) If you get an add, you have a choice to make about whether or not to root CC the add.. if the group can take 2, bring the add... otherwise root it off to the side.<br />
5) Pullers will take hits from time to time (a lot sometimes), so maxing your hp with the available buffs in group is highly advisable.  Another thing to consider is that you can also heal yourself if you need to.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Snare takes cyclone blade to tag off of immediantly, which will drain the warriors endurance very quickly when it's not needed.  If the warrior is semi companent, always use dispell -- that way the warrior can tag without using any endurance.<br />
 <br />
Of course if it's a knight tanking it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't seem like snare would be a horrible tool and warriors I've grouped with whilst pulling haven't complained when I've used snare =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Procs will work fine if they happen, and taunt is less reliable than procs. The warriors your grouping with most likely have a larger endurance pool than my warrior, so tagging with an aggro disc wouldn't be much of a problem anyways. Using endurance or chasing a mob til a proc happens isn't that big of a deal, but low aggro pulls are still a preferance of mine.<br />
 <br />
edit: However, if the warrior is slow to tag and the (ie) enc doesn't have much hp, you may want to use snare to help control aggro better,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if the mob is snared and you have a small amount of space kiting till the proc isn't a huge problem... also seen warriors trying to build up aggro on inc with bow damage.  Not all warriors I group with are top end tbh.  The one I group with mainly who isnt' in guild just hit 70 and has about 50 AAs I think.  He's not the best tank out there but he's usually about to gank aggro on a snare pull.<br />
<br />
Personally, I enjoy using snare when I'm pulling and I don't need to worry about adds on the way back to the group because it's less of a chance to get the snot beat out of ya since it takes more time for the mob to get to ya.  There are plenty of pulling strats out there and the best one is really the one you're most comfortable with doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Harmony works great, be sure to study our harmony line first though.<br />
<br />
One common misconception about Harmony is how it works. Our very first spell &quot;harmony&quot; lowers hate and frenzy on a single target and picks up some sorrounding mobs.<br />
<br />
Our second Harmony spell, Harmony of Nature, is a single target spell. I'm not sure if it works the same but...<br />
<br />
Our last one, Nature's Serenity is where the misconception comes forth. This doesn't lower hate/frenzy radius on mobs. It lowers assist / social assist on mobs, so you can STILL agro the mob harmonied by this spell if you get close, yet you can pull his neighbor relatively safe within a no-agro distance. This is also a single target spell, and does not pick up any others only your target.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped a bit, as you progress in levels you might need to switch your harmonies to match higher level mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Virtually every high end zone is indoor flagged, or has many mobs that harmony doesn't effect (that isn't level based restrction), like un-instanced stoneroot and MPG.  The only exception I can think of for a high end zone that harmony is a strong tool in is Qvic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">11-16-2005, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For indoor pulling just use root where you'd use harmony =p<br />
 <br />
Ppl fuss entirely too much over needing clean single pulls.  Root cc in most cases can be as good as you can expect a chanter to mez stuff.   <br />
 <br />
If it's one mob, dispell it and pull it to camp.   <br />
If it's 2 mobs root the front one. switch target to the back one and run back to camp.  Once debuffed and controled run back and either snare to be safe or dispell to pull.<br />
If it's 3 mobs root the front one switch to one of the moving ones snare it run back to camp.  Get that one taunted root the snared one as inc run back and snare the other.<br />
If it's 4 mobs mobs, target the one you want, turn away snare run for 2 seconds, stop completely and egress... run back, your mob should be single waiting to get pulled the rest of the way =p<br />
 <br />
snare + egress can be a powerful combo in a lot of places.. if you can snare a mob, unless it or a mob in the vicinty can dispell, you can get it single in most cases.   When mobs move while unaggro'd they move at walk speed which of course is slower than normal.. the way it works out is walk movement when snared = 0%  ie: it doesn't move.   Some mobs will sorta poof back to a spot near their bind but most will just not move at all until snare wears off so if you snare them and egress they'll be where you left them (hopefully now away from mobs).<br />
 <br />
If you want to get really fancy sometimes you can split mobs by sitting on the edge of their aggro radius.  Think there's a mechanism where they'll aggro from that extra distance if you're sitting and for some reason or another the usual adds may not.  Saw a pally do this in tipt for the ghosts was really neat.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
You want to matain a few aspects while pulling.  <br />
 <br />
1:  You want to use whatever your best speed buff is, but need to be careful not to outdistance the mob so it resets.<br />
2:  You want to snare as soon as you can (I often pull with snare) to ensure you are moving quicker then the mob.  If you need to pull the mob a good distance tho, use another spell to pull - however once a mob hits 97 percent it begins summoning, so careful if pulling with nuke or dot spells.<br />
3:  If you pull areas you get hit alot, but sure to invest in the CA Line of AA, as it will allow you to take a few rounds without dying as long as the mob isn't hitting drastically hard.<br />
 <br />
Should Druids be the main puller since we have Tracking? I thought Tanks are supposed to be the pullers. <br />
 <br />
I personally believe the person who is best suited to the area (Class, Skill, and zone knowledge) should pull.<br />
 <br />
I have solo'd so long I have no clue what role we are supposed to play.<br />
 <br />
Varies drastically by group makeup.<br />
 <br />
I have Healed for groups, nuked for others, pulled for some, and even tanked for a few it depends on what the group needs.<br />
