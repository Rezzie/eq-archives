If so I&quot;m sure we'd all like to hear your experiences. I tried it a few times and it seemed like it was easy for the casters to dance out of the way and stay out of range too often but maybe I was doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the same experience.  Doing some thinking, I expect it's because I haven't gotten the runspeed enchant on my boots yet, because I occasionally have the same thing happen in duels.<br />
<br />
There are few occasions where catform makes sense - 1 on 1 vs Mage/Warlock are the best, obviously.  In BG, there is little if any 1on1 anyhow so it's not a big issues.  Now if feline swiftness was lower in the talent tree, I could probably use it a lot more.<br />
<br />
Most of my time in arathi basin is spent in bearform - simply because alliance tends to target me first in a group.</div></div><hr />

I use it mostly to open with Pounce/Shred/Rake/Rip then usually go caster to heal then to bear. Cat just seems to soak up too much damage to stay in that form for any length of time.</div></div><hr />

Its a lot of fun to open up on them. NOthing like 1k crits followed up some claw crits to scare the ever living hell out of them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">09-20-2005, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree cat form is an absolute blast in arathi basin since most of the pvp is small scale.  i respecced to 8/21/22 to take advantage of the cat form changes and am enjoying myself quite a bit.  i have around 550 attack power, 4.3k hp, and 3.8k mana in my feral gear.  i typically wait for a fight to begin, then ravage the first priest/mage/warlock i see.  feline swiftness means they can't run away from me, so they basically run around like idiots until they die.  i especially like mages who slow fall off the cliff at the lumber mill, thinking they escaped safely.  i heal to full, go back to cat, land, and moonfire spam, or bite them to use up those combo points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfur</div><div class="date">09-21-2005, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See here's the thing for me. I can see catform being great, and the few times I've tried it in AB it was a blast, but if I don't heal, who will? Alliance on my server has a problem with not enough effective healers in the BGs, and I feel like when I play arund with cat and bear form I am neglecting my healing. Yes I can pop out of form but that takes time and sometimes it's too late.<br />
<br />
But you guys don't seem to have that problem I speak of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will heal if needed but its my second choice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfur</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Delayed response but yes of course we're trying to kill the enemy as fast as possible, and usually healing a rogue and a warrior nearby will contribute more dps than moonfiring a few people or whatever offensive approach we take. Healing is offensive, and helps kill things quicker by keeping the dps classes alive.<br />
<br />
But hopefully we'll have more options in 1.8, sure looks good.</div></div><hr />

Our DPS cant keep up with our healing skills...if i'm playing for fun yeah, prowl around in cat and take down some casters, but if i just wanna gain as much HK as i can in a limited time, nothing beats healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">09-29-2005, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what i typically do is play our class as i feel we were meant to be played and not stay in one role for the length of any fight.  i have around 4k mana in my pvp gear, so i am able to shift out and cast a NS + HT, a couple regrowths, and faerie fire those damn rogues, then shift back into bear or cat as necessary.  if your ab games go anything like mine, you would think that dedicated healers have &quot;KILL ME&quot; written all over them.  i find that i live a lot longer and can consequently do more damage and healing when i stay in forms and only shift out to heal as necessary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">10-01-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use catform more to portect myself from being an early assist train victim more then I use it to actually open with a melee attack.  When my group get's to their postion in AB I immediatly cat, stealth and track.. I'll try and get far back from any fighting that might start and shift out to start healing.  It's usally rather effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our quite successful tactic in AB is myself paired up with a Warrior (or sometimes another Druid) and a Priest paired up with a Mage. The Warrior charges into battle, the priest shields him and I regrowth/rejuv. Then mage follows a few seconds after doing Arcane Explosion spams (while being shielded and flash healed) and we can easily kill a group of enemies that are not organised (which most aren't) because they all try and beat the warrior to death.<br />
<br />
I never go into cat form for offense because a Warrior healed by me is a lot more effective than I am doing DPS. I'm not Feral specced though so your mileage may vary. I, like Rockwell use cat form as a defensive mechanism, but that's just my playstyle and it works for us.</div></div><hr />

This was posted on the WoW forums the other day.  It's a Field Marshall Feral, solo'n his way through AB.  The rabid idiots on the WoW forums had some problem with his play-style... but I think that's unfair all things considered.  It's all 1.8 and he shows his talents/gear at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">11-02-2005, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently been encountering one Alliance druid in AB.  I don't know what his/her build is, but it's enough for max feline swiftness, feral charge, and Furor and NS in restoration.  He may also have Nature's Reach in the balance tree, but I can't be sure.<br />
<br />
This guy shreds people pretty fast.  Add in a hunter at range or a rogue stunlocking, and the two can bring down a 4K hp druid in about 10 seconds.  He is very practiced about shifting out once you begin casting Hibernate, moving a little bit away, going back to bear and feral charging without delay.<br />
<br />
I'm learning that the best thing to do is run from him/her lol.</div></div><hr />
