<br />
Thanks to the random dungeon finder, I'm getting back to my 69 resto druid and doing pugs as main healer.<br />
<br />
I'm totally out of touch when it comes to the new druid spells/abilities/talent tree.<br />
<br />
If I'm doing primarily 5-man instances, what should my spell rotation be?<br />
<br />
Any other general druid tips would be appreciated, as well as healing gear I should get. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">01-14-2010, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiya Lum and welcome back =)<br />
<br />
I would link you my armory but I logged out in bear gear and haven't upgraded any of my gear recently (despite having a ton of badges), so I'll link my husband's below.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure there's a specific rotation.  As I've learned from badgering fellow druids here, there seems to be a lot of variation from one resto's preferences to the next as far as what they cast and when and I'm not sure I quite remember what abilities were available at level 69-70, but I'll do my best....<br />
<br />
When I'm healing, I tend to cast rejuv first and keep it rolling on my tank nearly all the time. <br />
<br />
When the tank starts taking heavy damage, I try to patch it up with regrowth or nourish (usually Nourish, since it's my flash heal of choice and I'm guilty of being a nourish spammer lol)...or a quick Swiftmend =)...Since I'm glyphed for Nourish, that makes it more yummy to me.  My husband glyphed for Regrowth, so when the tank's HP bar drops, he throws Regrowth.  Depends on your glyphs and preferences =)<br />
<br />
I don't often use lifebloom since they changed it.  I throw maybe 1x Lifebloom, but otherwise rely on my other HoTs and Nourish to keep everyone up.  I picked up Wild Growth, which is also nice for when your group takes a little splash AoE damage.  If I'm not having mana issues- I sometimes just throw WG to have another HoT on the tank...just because it's fun /shrug.  <br />
<br />
For gear, it's still basically the same as it used to be, although we've been having a debate here at the grove recently over the benefits of haste versus crit, spirit versus spellpower and the like.<br />
<br />
This (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Durotan&amp;cn=Balzeem) is my husband's armory link.  He's logged out in his resto gear/spec as I write this.  Perhaps it will help?  I've never seen a problem with his healing at all when I've tanked for him =) and he seems to be a sought after healer when he's on.  <br />
<br />
(Except that we argue about which is more valuable for restos, haste or crit and spellpower versus regen...but I digress).<br />
<br />
I hope that helps =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">01-14-2010, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agrees with everything Destinae posted   :texla: <br />
<br />
My &quot;rotation&quot; is as follows (on tanks):<br />
<br />
Regrowth, Lifebloom x3, Rejeuve <br />
<br />
That's sacred to me.  And, you'll note that I'm still using the Lifebloom x3 stack.  I'm tired of the Lifebloom being nerfed in one patch only to be rebuffed in a later one, so I just stick to the way it was always intended.<br />
<br />
Now, when pugging a tank, it might be best to cast  Rejeuve first for a quick Swiftmend fix.  But, like Destinae said, each Tree is different and has their own healing comfort zone.<br />
<br />
As for the age old Druid argument:  Haste or Crit?  <br />
<br />
I was on Team Haste, but I've switched to Team Crit.<br />
I was on Team Spellpower, but I've switched to Team Regen.<br />
<br />
Again, that's just a personal preference.  Once you get into raiding, you'll know what you're missing, and you'll aim to get it.<br />
<br />
And don't be too concerned Gear Score.  I've recently discovered (for example) that the set bonus from my T9 set has been far more beneficial to me in a raid than any of my Level 245 gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">01-20-2010, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/Agree with Mag.<br />
<br />
I'm currently still on team haste and an avid follower of team Regen...But like Magellan said...you tend to get a feel for what you like/dislike and what you want or need on your gear.  (Admittedly, I'm not really on Team Haste on purpose...I'm not entirely sure how it happened, but it works for my healing style for now so I'm okay with it. =D)<br />
<br />
I might try out Mag's rotation sometime.  Let the tank take a few punches, throw Regrowth, then maybe rejuv and a nourish to patch things up if he loses another chunk of health...I bet that would be better for a paladin tank, since I'm told their in-combat mana regen is helped along by being healed.  Hmm....yeah I think I'll give that a go and see if my pally friend notices a difference =D</div></div><hr />

although i dont heal much due to my atrocious fps for the past month i always preferred faster heals to the possiblility of a crit.<br />

and i like raw spellpower for healing power.<br />

i did not find i was oom much at all in heroics.<br />

I'm experimenting with the Lifebloom x3 and Rejuve, it's a bit scary to see the tank's healthbar go down.  So I usually panic and throw on a Regrowth.  Then the Lifebloom procs, and I overheal.<br />

<br />
I NS+HT'd her and it healed her for about 12k non-crit, but it bought me enough time to refresh my rejuv and get a regrowth and a nourish on her and send her back on her way.<br />
<br />
And yes, Nourish is a lvl 80 skill.  It's so nice to have though.  I'm a nourish addict.  It's like a druid version of Flash of Light or Flash Heal.  When you have hots rolling on the tank, Nourish can become a big juicy heal too =)  We're talking 10-12k non-crit and higher if it crits for you...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overhealing with HoT's is kind of unavoidable.  If you aren't running out of mana then don't sweat the overhealing meter.  It's really nothing you can help.  Especially if you are raid healing and keeping rejeuve up on 6-8 players at a time.<br />
<br />
And, you will see some serious (and acceptable) overhealing when you get your T9 gear where the set bonus gives Rejeuvenation a chance to crit.  It's like a constant explosion of large green numbers all over the screen, and you're not even pressing buttons.  <br />
<br />
It makes me giddy.  :tongue:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I used the LB stack also first when I hit 80 and started to build up my kit. And then some regrowths.<br />
<br />
But since I have the T9 4st bonus I tend to start off with a rejuv on the tank, then a regrowth. If there are a few melee dps in the party I do a Wild Growth (80 spell). Else a rejuv and one lifebloom that I will let bloom is mostly enough. Spike dmg usally a quick Nourish, and regrowth if the is constant dmg.<br />
<br />
In raids I tend to use more regrowths and Nourish. And the my whole arsenal of spell is being used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me just say that I'm a pretty big fan of Nature's Swiftness + Healing touch to &quot;save the day&quot; during unexpected damage spikes...So healing touch still finds a home in my &quot;omg!!!!!!!!&quot; rotation...<br />
<br />
Also...I have a pretty decent amount of haste (whether that's good or bad...I've yet to really determine) and so casting healing touch isn't too far fetched...<br />
<br />
And the last reason I still love Healing Touch...The Annoyance Factor.  Yeah.  My husband thinks only &quot;noobs&quot; throw healing touch.  So if he's watching me heal and I can safely throw it without someone dying...I do it just to hear,  &quot;Babe...WHY are you using healing touch??? WHY?&quot;  &gt;=)</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly sure Blizzard just going to have us zone in and open chests of loot soon.  ;)  <br />
<br />
Joking aside, there's nothing wrong with using LB in five mans.  But mostly rejuve/lifebloom if you want/nourish to supplement.  Regrowth on the tank works too but it's whatever you feel most comfortable with.  <br />
<br />
All the anti-lifebloom people are raiders because for raids, unless you're tank healing it's really inefficient to spend GCDs stacking lifebloom and the mana cost isn't efficient anymore. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">02-12-2010, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  I tend to be on raid heals most of the time (thanks to stupid amounts of haste and mana regen) and LB just isn't worth it in most cases.  Generally, I'll throw rejuv+1 or 2 LB on the tanks and let it bloom, then reapply just to support the tank healers a little.  Mana cost seems about the same provided you're letting it bloom, unless they changed it.  It cost 2x as much to cast the spell, but you get 50% of the mana cost back when it blooms...at least that's how it was last I knew lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">02-12-2010, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but I think the issue is that you have to cast LB at least twice to get the efficiency of 1 rejuve which also lasts longer to boot.  =/  <br />
<br />
(Before talents, because I'm too lazy to calculate in mana reducing talents) <br />
<br />
Lifebloom x 2 = 1957 mana -&gt; 978 mana back.<br />
<br />
Rejuve x 1 = 629 mana (15 seconds) <br />
<br />
It's only ~300 mana difference but it does add up after a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to drag this totally off topic, but my guild skipped my invite for one of our raids because I usually only do ~1.7k HPS...The guild wanted 2.5kHPS.  I'm not even sure how to get such high HPS. Is mine just lower because I use Nourish so much?<br />
<br />
I kind of figure as long as my assignments aren't dying then it shouldn't matter what my HPS is, but apparently this is something I need to focus on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats good for me on a strict wow timelimit :p<br />
<br />
i find i like LB and rejuv/regrowth doing 5 mans.<br />
<br />
regrowth is pretty quick to case with my haste and then i know its a small amount of healing over a longish period of time topped up with LB etc<br />

<br />
Can you link yourself Des?  I'm both curious and nosy.  <br />
<br />
What are you currently raiding, and who are your fellow healers?  I ask this, because there are some healing classes (Shamans, anyone?) who will always beat us on the HPS meters simply because they have certain advantages.<br />
<br />
If your assignments are alive and well, then there is no reason to complain.<br />
<br />
However, it's hard to argue with someone who won't listen to logic - only to numbers on a meter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">02-16-2010, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HPS is a poor meter to judge a healer but it can be a useful tool.  It really depends on your healing assignments.  1.7k can sound sort of low but I mean it depends on the fights.  Long drawn out fights with phase changes are going to drop your HPS very fast.<br />
<br />
However a raid leader that bases things solely on HPS is not one worth listening to.   You can be pretty aggressive as a druid healer and win the meters fight but it's not something that makes you a better healer I feel.  You're given assignments, you watch your assignments.  If you're put on raid for fights like Festergut and do 1.7k, there's an issue but just saying 'your HPS is low' is not very helpful.<br />
<br />
My best tip is that for 25 man raids, you want to stack your haste and spellpower as much as you can.  The goal is really to get to 800-ish haste so your GCD is really low so you can just roll rejuves on the entire raid.  Being able to cast hots as fast as possible enables you to watch more people and cast more spells.  Since most of our casts are insta-cast, having a 1 second GCD really just enables you to unlock full tree powah. <br />
<br />
@ Magellan: That's not entirely true.  Druids are pretty OP on any fight with predictable raid damage, especially fights with AoE auras.  Twin Val'kyr, Blood Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, Festergut, these are all fights where druids shine very well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@ Mag, I don't really  have a &quot;set group of healers&quot; that I often run with.  In order to raid anything, I'm having to pug =(.  I tend to find myself with priests (mostly holy) and healadins though.  <br />
<br />
(And playing on a laptop I'm sure isn't helping, but I've adapted pretty well I think lol)<br />
<br />
Also, if the other healers are keeping everyone at full health constantly, it makes it hard to crank out much HPS...or at least &quot;effective&quot; hps.  I usually tend to shine on the &quot;overhealing&quot; meter =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your right Sytaera.  Resto Druid's are pretty essential to a raid - we bring a lot to the table.  Not to mention, we are practically impossible to kill on a battleground.  :devil-lau <br />
<br />
I guess at the time I posted that, I was speaking more of personal experience than anything else.  I run with a Resto Shaman who is absolutely fierce.  She effectively (and efficiently) outheals everyone she runs with.  <br />
<br />
@Des:  Sytaera makes an excellent point re: haste.  That's key.<br />
<br />
In fact reading Sytaera's post made me realize I need a lot more of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had been stacking haste, but then got pushed toward stacking more crit for awhile- Bigger heals &gt; better than quick heals...and I don't like it, so I'm headed back toward haste/spellpower I think.  I'm not even sure anymore.  I'll have to try and puggle into a raid here soon and see if I can't weasel my way up higher on the healing meters =)</div></div><hr />
