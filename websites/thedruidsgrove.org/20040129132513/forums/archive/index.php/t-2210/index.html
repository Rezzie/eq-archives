<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kildaere LiSiofra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need a new quest to do. =)<br />
<br />
I have done very few quests, have epics, gloves of earthcrafting, coldain shawl, coldain ring, solstice earring, benevolance tali..<br />
<br />
I'm lookin for something that I can solo or duo w/ my 2box cleric.<br />
<br />
It doesnt' have to yield the best item out there, or even a really good one.. rather, I'm lookin for some fun. I've got all my tradeskills up to 200 or higher, but would prefer a non-tradeskill quest.. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaliane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is a tradeskill quest, but the Aid Grimel series yields this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alyn Cross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">chardok rings -- sorta mind boggling when killing all those goblins, but if you did any xp there back in the day, or haven't killed in chardok ever, it won't take nearly as long as most people think.<br />
<br />
the broodmother quest -- not sure what it's really called, 2 versions of it, one for giant faction, one for coldain.<br />
<br />
get keys -- just having all of st/vp/emp/vt is notable. <br />
<br />
find the solution to the mysterious 'perm key' for Howling Stones -- some people have one, nobody seems to remember how they made it. <br />
<br />
Arx key quest -- can prolly solo intot the middle stages of it, at least through the first 2, i'm sure. <br />
<br />
the quest for the big/odd kill -- play with big mobs you have no business trying.  like the dude who's plotting how to solo Faydedar (sorry man, forget yer name).  start in WW, kill dragons.  practice your strat on killing summoners.  Spire Lord in letalis.  go for the duo/trio kill of talendor.  1 group zlandicar.  be the tank for Vindi.  fun schtuff like that.<br />
<br />
hope it helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>L1ndara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There really aren't many quests that aren't simply grinding crap.  Just thinking, if you do the wood elf illusion hatt for your cleric it means... endless boring grinding of faction.  If you want to do the chardok cords and rings it's... endless boring grinding of faction followed by endless boring camping of a mob and endless boring killing of juggernaughts to get the tendon.<br />
 <br />
  There is the VP and VT key &quot;quests&quot; although the final parts can't be duoed.  Not yet anyway.<br />
 <br />
  The LoY quest spells for both your cleric and druid would keep you busy killing really annoyingly tough green to low blue mobs.  Charm of the Emerald Brotherhood is another one for your charm slot.  The there are the various ring quests that you have to get the lugald flesh for.<br />
 <br />
  The alternate entrance quests for PoP are somewhat interesting, Torment in particular.<br />
 <br />
  If you have the flags for it the Binden Concerrentia is nice but better for people that can't gate/faithstone:  everquest.allakhazam.com/...item=17786 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17786)<br />
 <br />
  Secrets of the Planes doesn't require too heavy in the way of flagging but you'll need to buy some multi-quests if you're not elemental flagged and most of it isn't duoable with a druid/cleric:  everquest.allakhazam.com/...item=18123 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18123)<br />
 <br />
  Shield of Banewarding is a somewhat interesting quest:  everquest.allakhazam.com/...?item=7830 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7830)<br />
 <br />
  Loyalist Shield of Honour is sort of neat:  everquest.allakhazam.com/...item=15971 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15971)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KrystofC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Coldain Ring quests is my favorite series of quests, but since you already have that, I'll submit my 2nd favorite :p <br />
<br />
Start it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?zone=4&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Qeynos Investigator&lt;/a&gt;<br />
End with this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13796&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Qeynos Badge of Nobility&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
It's fun, the story is interesting, the tasks are varied and neat, and, get this, NO CAMPING!  Whoa, did I just say that?  Shh, keep it down or they'll nerf it :p</div></div><hr />

You combine the 4 wing keys in a container thats a ground spawn inside HS iirc (Keys are No Rent but the container isnt).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recently started a lowbie wizard quest with my druid. The quest is actually for a couple runes that make a wizard spell, but you can skip the end part and keep the insta-click Identify item.  Unlimited charges of insta identify (my silvery mask is just too slow). <br />
<br />
The fun part is, you dont kill anything. Its a traveling quest. You go to a bunch of semi-remote zones and pick up a ground spawn wizard rod. Once you have all 10 you combine in a containor. Quest starts in Everfrost, cant remember the name of it. Look it up on alahkazams. I even found some areas that I didnt know existed. A much needed break from exp grinding.<br />

What about the Qeynos Badges Series?<br />
<br />
Even though it's buggy in a spot or two, I do really enjoy the quests.</div></div><hr />
