Also is this armor nerf going to hurt us bear tanks bad?<br />

As far as the &quot;armor nerf&quot; goes, Tlbj posted an update to that (thanks man!) that says Survival of the Fittest is going to get a HUGE buff that should (in my opinion) make up for the incoming nerf, and will probably end up being a tad bit better for us ferals.</div></div><hr />

So, it only affects our white damage attack speed.<br />
<br />
Haste isn't too bad of a stat for bear TPS since bears have slower attack speed and GCD.  I wouldn't stack haste for bear TPS, but it isn't worthless like it is for cats.<br />
<br />
Right now the up coming armor change seems to be a bit too vague to determine if it is good or bad.  Many are saying it is a nerf for T7+ and a bit of a buff pre-T7.  Though if they go back to the 400% bear mod rather than the current 370% (?) it comes out quite well.  In short, we don't know the details and the change isn't on the PTR yet, so everyone thinks the sky is falling.</div></div><hr />

The weapon changes are going to amp our white damage and with a super fast attack speed it could be a significant jump in white damage. <br />
<br />
As for our GCD, well 1sec is still better than 1.5sec.  Remember rogues benefit heavily from haste, and they function similarly.  Most of their attacks are instants.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression we had a 1 sec attack speed (white dmg) and 1.5 sec GCD (special attacks)  Thats why white damage sneaks in the middle regardless how fast I spam mangle!<br />
<br />
Either way our DPS (sustainable) will always be restricted by energy rather than GCD.  I would love to see a energy regen that scaled with haste for kitties.</div></div><hr />

Cats and Rogues have a 1s GCD, everyone else (including other Druid forms) has a 1.5s GCD.  Cat white attacks are independent of our yellow attacks, that's why they &quot;sneak in&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Just curious, since patch 3.0, do bears Lacerate more than once?  I have found I get much more threat/DPS from just one lacerate and then maul until the lacerate is needing a refresh.  Has anyone else found this?  I don't have any solid numbers to provide, and perhaps the increased DPS is just because maul hits 2x targets, but I seem to have less threat issues on single target fights without using lacerate (or using it only to activate R&amp;T)</div></div><hr />

why would you leave out lacerate?<br />
<br />
mangle has a 4.5 CD (if skilled)<br />
what are u doing in this time if not lacerate?<br />
dont forget maul wont take a GCD <br />
so u can use it without watching on other abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, mangle when it is available, keep lacerate stack up (refresh it every 7s), use swipe and FFF when you can.  And maul with any leftover rage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same for me. 1 mangle at the start on primary target and then maul and swipe.<br />
<br />
on bosses i feel the gap caused of the CD on bear-mangle with lacerate</div></div><hr />
