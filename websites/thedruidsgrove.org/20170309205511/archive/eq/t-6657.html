This FAQ is made up of my own experiences and various researchs.. Lots of information may not be correct so feel free to correct me. I wil update it asap.<br />

GENERAL QUESTIONS<br />
What is GOD?  <br />
GOD = Gate of Discord, the 7 th EQ expansion. It is geared toward level 50 + people. ( well, its geared toward people with EP gears and plus really. )<br />
<br />
Do I get anything if I brought the GOD expansion from a store?  <br />
 Yes, you get a nice little staff  as the reward. To get it type /claim in game and make sure you have least 1 inventory slot free. Its an ok item if you not in a raiding guild imo. It gives about 2 levels of faction to the slaves group in GOD. <br />
<br />
ZONES: maps, directions, moving around<br />
Where can I download GOD maps?   <br />
There are here. http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/goddl.php?PHPSESSID=70a2ecc54094874876d0de41e7d854  e8 If you slack and don't have LOY... &quot;cough&quot; like me &quot;cough&quot; you doomed =p<br />
<br />
Maps are always available here: http://maps.krak.net/<br />
<br />
How do I get to GOD?  <br />
You can get to GOD by go to any LDON camp and hail the Magus person. she/he wil port you to Nedaria's landing. From there you can talk to the magus in there and get port to Natimbi, The Broken Shores. There is also a druid port that ports you directly to Natimbi, The Broken Shores I think. Not too sure though.<br />
<br />
Explain me the zone connections in GOD.  <br />
Well, you enter GOD zone by Nedaria's Landing. You wil first enter Natimbi, The Broken Shores. From there you can go back to Nedaria's landing or head north and go to the next zone: Qinimi, the Court of Nihila. From there you can go to either Riwwi, Colliseum of Games, Barindu, The Hanging Gardens<br />
 or Ferubi. Each zones are connected with each other so you can go from Barindu to either Riwww, or Barindu, or Ferubi or back to Qinmi. There 2 npcs in Barindu that wil give you trials that you need to progess to next zone. Gamesh wil give you sewers trials while the App girl will give you vxed and tipt trials. 6 trials in total to progess to next zone. <br />
<br />
- Natimbi, the Broken Shores <br />
It is a low level zone and made for xping from level 55 to 60. Mostly green to light blue con mobs for a level 65 in that zone. Mobs similar in levels to POD/PON mobs. <br />
<br />
- Qinimi, the Court of Nihila <br />
Small zone, mainly gateway for zones like Rwwi, Barindu , ferubi. Mobs are Kos are alot harder here and all kos. Dogs see invis. The blue sphere in the middle is for some sort of Ring event it seems. We killed the 4 guardians by the sphere and  a named pop. She dropped a page and a key.. Unknow use atm. <br />
<br />
- Riwwi, Colliseum of Games <br />
A zone with some sort of events it seems. 2 boss here, targetable but you can't kill him. Hail them won't do anything. Mobs here hits for 200 to 600 ish. Nothing droped otw but some no drop and droppable unknow stuff. <br />
<br />
- Barindu, The Hanging Gardens <br />
Safe to run around with invis but dog type of mobs do see though invis. Quest npcs/Dynm exp zones npc in here. However, they are guarded heavily by kos npcs. Watch out. <br />
<br />
- Ferubi <br />
This is the evil city, everyone starts kos here. Mobs hits for 1 k + and can really hurt you. A good group of time geared people should do good here as long you don't get adds. Never afk here since trains are plenty and alot of mobs see though invis and sos. <br />
<br />
- The Abysmal Sea <br />
You can get to this zone by boat from Natambi it seems. It is the main city for GOD with npcs for quests, tradeskills, guild masters, merchants etc.. All you need its here. However, a guildie says he needs a certain type of faction to get aces to the boats here. I have never been tothis city however. I am a bit clueless. <br />
<br />
- Kod'Taz - Sullied Ritual Hall <br />
To get to this zone, you must have completed 4 of the sewers trials plus Vxed and tipt trials.  Various events and trials are in this zone. Most are used to need for progessing in GOD. <br />
<br />
- Ikkinz, Charmbers of Destruction <br />
4 raids and 3 single group trials are located in this instanced zone, which its located inside Kod`taz. It has different entrances depends on the raid/trials. It is very hard to get to and you wil die 80% of the time trying to get to the zone entrance unless you have some sort of DA. Those trials and raids are required for progess atm. I don't suggest you try them unles you are fully time geared and know what you doing ! <br />
<br />
- Yxtta - Pulpit of Exiles  <br />
The entrance to this zone its inside Kod`Taz and currently has some interesting features inside this zone. I won't spoil the fun for you. :P<br />
<br />
- Uqua - The Ocean God Chantry  <br />
Entrance its inside Yxtta zone. Hard to reach since there are see sos/see invis mobs inside. Also this is an exp zone and will only allow 54 players to join it. Defeating this zone and complete all the progession quests in Kod`taz  will gain you acess to Qvic, <br />
<br />
- Qvic- Prayer Grounds of Calling  <br />
Raid zone  much like kod`taz, except mobs here are alot harder and see invis. You will need a raid to get around here, unlike kod`taz. Lots of good loots here and ancients spells do drop here. <br />
<br />
- Inktu'ta- the Unmasked Chapel <br />
An instanced zone like Uqua. Bug free atm from what I heard. You need to defeat this zone 's boss to progess. <br />
<br />
-Txevu- Lair of the Elite <br />
You gain acess to this one after you have beaten Inktu`ta. Raid zone is all I know so far. More Info inc when I know more ! <br />
<br />
<br />
GoD AA's: Regular and Leadership<br />
Do we get any new aas for GOD expansion?   <br />
Yes, a couple and they cost alot too.<br />
Casters Realm info (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=5309)<br />
Druid's Grove info (http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=6674)<br />
<br />
Are there new class titles for the GoD AA's?<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Which aa I should get first? omg?!?! <br />
Well its pretty much your choice but SCS its really helpful I find. It decrease spell aggro by 20% at level 3. The costs its like 3/6/9 I think. <br />
<br />
What its leadership experience?  <br />
Its a new feature in GOD, it enables you many features like increase group's Hp, mana, attack rating, regen etc.. However, you need to find a group leader with alot of leadership exp to enjoy it. Press L in game to open it. <br />
<br />
How do I earn Leadership xp?   <br />
First you must be either the group leader or raid leader. It takes away 20% of your xp earned on mobs. so it can take a pretty long time to get points enough for the nice abilitys. <br />
<br />
SPELLS<br />
Do we get any new spells for GOD expansion?   <br />
Yes, they can be find on this thread. http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=6565<br />
<br />
Where can I get the new spells?  <br />
1 spell is quested. Rest are dropped off bosses in GOD other than the port ones. . Ports can be find in the Magus in Nedaria's Landing. <br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY<br />
Omg I died , is there a GY system or something?   <br />
There is a NPC at  Qinimi, the Court of Nihila   who is called Besana the Gravedigger. She wil summon corpses for you. However, she only summon corpses for the Qinimi zone atm. If you died in other zones, old fashioned CR for you . :p If you died in any of the instanced xp zones, aka the sewers, the corpse wil pop right outside the zone entrance in Barindu. <br />
<br />
So, anything should I beware before I enter GOD?  <br />
Yes, GOD mobs run nearly SOE speed, hits fast and hard, stun alot and have insane regen. Dog type of mobs see invis but there are other mobs also . make sure you con them before run past them. Have exodus loaded at all times.  :) <br />
 <br />
Can I solo well in GOD?  <br />
Mobs hits for 1 k + in zones where mobs are  deep blue con and give xp =p Hard to snare and root . Charm doesn't hold well either. Not mention they are fast too.  I guess you can handle it if you skilled enough. <br />
<br />
What GoD zones can I bind in?<br />
Abysmal, rest are non bindable.<br />
<br />
TRIBUTE<br />
Explain me the Tribute system  <br />
The Tribute system, another new feature in GOD. it allows you gain a sorta perm buff. (&quot;wink&quot;) You can open the window in game by press ctrl U. However, nothing wil be in the window til you see your local Tribute master. It costs a certain tribute points for every 10 minutes, depends on the buff. The buff can be FT 5, 150 hp, 150 mana, regen 10, etc.. Lots of nice ones. They stack with each other but not with item's focus. =( <br />
<br />
How do I gain tribute points?   <br />
You gain it by donating dropable items to your local tribute master. Different items worth different points. It can be armor , gems, weapons etc.. Other items atm wil not work. as a general rule, + hp/mana item  wil gain you lots of points. Its another way to sell all your junks in the bank. <br />
<br />
How do I find my tribute master?   <br />
Go to your home town and do a ctrl + F . It wil pop up a list of npcs. click on your tribute master. :)<br />
<br />
The Tribute masters are back, but prices are SUPER reduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I solo well in GOD? <br />
<br />
As a druid, no. Mobs hits for 1 k + in zones where mobs are deep blue con and give xp =p Hard to snare and root . Charm doesn't hold well either. Not mention they are fast too.<br />
I was actually able to solo in all the new GoD zones except Ferubi.  Just need to be creative and of course very careful in finding locations to root-rot.  Mobs in Qinimi, Riwwi, and Barindu are about as tough as Tier 2 and 3 PoP.  Maybe a little tougher depending what you pull, flurries for 600+, ouch.  (again, except Ferubi).  And mem Harmony, you'll need it.  Also, there are a few Dark blue to 65 Mobs in Natimbi that might be quad-kitable, havn't tried yet though.<br />
<br />
EXP does suck though, 2% a kill AA, lotsa hps as usual.<br />
<br />
Also, the Gravedigger in Qinimi - Court of Nihila was working for corpses in-zone only, on Xev at least.  Tested myself thanks to some crazy see-invis SoE speed freaks :)</div></div><hr />

There is a NPC at Qinimi, the Court of Nihila who is called Besana the Gravedigger. She wil summon corpses for you. However, she won't summon corpse for you atm. Not sure what the problem is. So you pretty much to CR for now.<br />
<br />
The Gravedigger works, she only summons corpses in Qinimi though.  She is there to let people get corpses out of the dome after a failed raid.<br />

<br />
<br />
I found I can solo.  Rooting and rotting is the best method however.  Create an instanced dungeon and you can solo with care.  it will take practice and care, but it can be done.  But, if you are elemental flagged, you are better off soloing in Fire still.  Mobs in the instanced dungeons only give about 8% of an AA.  <br />
<br />
If you are 60 with direcharm, you will have a lot of luck in Natimbi where there are tons of DC level animals.<br />
<br />
Riwwi, Colliseum of Games <br />
<br />
A zone with some sort of events it seems. 2 boss here, targetable but you can't kill him. Hail them won't do anything. Mobs here hits for 200 to 600 ish. Nothing droped otw but some no drop and droppable unknow stuff. <br />
<br />
<br />
Saw this information reposted on my guild messageboard:<br />
I was given the pleasure to lead a group in a new ring style event. The group we had wasn't balanced at all (cleric/2wiz/rogue/ranger/shaman) but we made due for the first 6 parts easy. To start this peticular ring event you need to do a subquest in the zone but the GM tester gave me that flag so we could start testing. <br />
<br />
The event starts in riwwui(whatever the spelling is) in the middle of the coliseum there. There are 4 guardians that don't attack and 6 slave mobs in the arena pit. You talk to one of the slaves in the arena and send them the trigger phrase to start the ring. The first part is very easy, it was a dog that faught like a tier 1 plane mob. When you start each phase of the ring you receive a bag, the mobs you kill have heads that you combine in the bag. You take that combined bag to another NPC in the zone and he give you your reward. The reward starts out bad but gets better as you progress (like the coldain ring).<br />
<br />
When you want to start phase 2 of the ring you just hand in your reward. The kicker is if you lose, you have to start over from phase 1 so make sure you don't lose. The mobs in the ring can't be rooted/snared, don't summon at the time of this writing, mitigate slow, and can be mezzed but not charmed. As the rings <br />
progressed the mobs got harder obviously and sometimes more numerious. Sometimes named style mobs would come on waves that hit harder and have alot more hp so be ready for those.<br />
<br />
I asked the GM tester what was stopping a raid from assisting in the kills. Instead of telling me, he showed me. He started up a phase of the ring for himself and told me to attack it, the instant I did I was booted to the zone in. He said whatever group starts that phase of the ring is the only group that can kill it. My group got to phase 7 of the ring before our first wipeout. We wiped out 3 times before we refined our tactics and got a few aa/gear upgrades to help us perform more like a balanced group. Two of our group members had to log after the 7th phase so we grabbed a necro and enchanter (yay) to help us. With an enchanter to mes the 8th phase went easier than the 7th.<br />
<br />
The 9th phase was alot harder. The GM said we might need defensive to make this work so right away I'm thinking &quot;damn I'm screwed&quot;. The 9th phase was a single named, hit quaded for 1100 and migitated slow very well. Well I died 2 times before the mob made it to 90%, the GM would freeze the zone between my deaths so we didn't have to start the phase over again. On the 3rd attempt we preslowed the mob while it was frozen and I started tanking. I had to use weaponshield near the end but the named went down. With the 9th phase my reward got much better (like a 25ac neck/waist with 7 to most stats, 125ish hp/mana/end and ft3/vengence 3). The 10th wave was alot of mobs, some where easily messed, some were easily slowed so figure those out fast. They went down and the event was finished. The reward didn't gain any stat upgrades but it gained some ldon slots so you can upgrade it however you want to.<br />
