Disease: I am fairly sure allot of the rats at the zone in can be DC'ed<br />
Fire: the young horses can be DCed as well ... however as they are all BEFORE C1 and your fighting mostly will be either in C1 or near the C2 area you're going to have a problem getting your DC pet there anyway<br />
<br />
As a standard rule (assuming you're lvl 65): if it's a light blue con you can give it a shot (just use common sense wether a mob is an animal or not :))<br />
<br />
As of all the DC pets the PoAir ones were the only ones that actually make me wet my pants, as they tripple for 398 (with mage weapons) and with Savage Spirit and SoVallon they're at the haste cap and do a LOT of damage :) And boy do they look cute!</div></div><hr />

The easiest way to spawn it is by killing Storm Gruezoks in the Forest area - it can also be spawned by killed Wandering Grezlans but they summon and the SGs don't.  Unlike the other bears in the forest - other forest mobs do not assist the Cub.<br />
<br />
I have the DC list from the old forums saved somewhere, I'll dig it up and post it - I believe it was more complete for the old world mobs than the EQD list is.</div></div><hr />

There's also &quot;A Phoenix Breezewing&quot; that on death spawns 4 level 55 phoenixes (not DCable, forget the name), the names are similar enough that some people confuse the two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunfire</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres the list from the old board as promised (thanks to Lotusfly). Many of these were hypothetical and I didnt save the results of the testing but as far as my knowledge goes I've added comments in italics.  Maybe if I get some time I'll merge everything into one.<br />
<br />
Buying Dire Charm, as a druid, is perhaps a little unusual one might think, given that its restricted to animal races. Maybe it is useful to put down here my findings so far. Throughout Lotusfly's life, she has always liked charming pets; there is something about a high-powered, high-HP creature fighting for you that just seems strangely right - even if it does turn around and take chunks out of your skirt every few minutes. :)<br />
<br />
Level Limitation<br />
<br />
As with the Enchanter and Necromancer Dire Charms, it appears that the druidic one follows the same rules, as one might expect. It is animal-only, and has a level cap of 46 (I think). <br />
<br />
Level 46 creatures are rather significant though, for us of course, this is balanced by the fact that level 46 animals are not available in a huge amount of zones. With some selective charming, however, you can have a pet with 5-10k HPs, who will happily double-qud hit for around the 140 mark. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Possible Pet Targets<br />
<br />
A number of spoliler sites list the level ranges of various animals throughout Norrath. I'll list below all those in the level range 40-48. Levels and HPs are shown in brackets.<br />
<br />
All sub-40 animals have been omitted from this list, though such creatures may be great for farming pelts!<br />

There are a great deal of Good Opportunities (tm) in the above, it seems. I'll examine some of the more surprising &quot;animal&quot; tagged mobs and see what kind of tricks we can get up to. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bugs<br />
<br />
This skill has a few issues, though none that would stop a charm-crazy druid such as myself from buying the skill...<br />
<br />
When trying to pet an animal, one often has to 'spam' the hotkey, as &quot;You are too far away from your target, get closer!&quot; and &quot;You cannot see your target!&quot; messages are often the result, even if the poor beast is standing two feet in front of you. Enchanters and necromancers report precisely the same with their Dire Charms, and the charm will work after a little spamming - sometimes none is required, sometimes a lot.<br />
<br />
If you try to Dire Charm an animal that has previously been charmed (either Dire or normally), your Dire Charm will get the message &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; - even when the previous charm has long gone. Again, this is common to the enchanter and necromancer Dire Charms.<br />
<br />
Though not really a bug, it is a little annoying that if you attempt to charm a creature higher than level 46, then your Dire Charm will give the &quot;Your target is too high level for this spell!&quot; message, and will require you to wait the 72 minutes for the skill to refresh. <br />
<br />
To me, this seems a little harsh. I suppose that it does rather put the responsibility upon the Charmer's shoulders to ensure that the target is of the correct level but, unless we use such evil tools as ShowEQ, we're down to having a level 46 twink running at our side to con mobs (a necromancer on my server actually does this!).<br />
<br />
The spell looks to be unfinished, due to the targetting bugs; I would anticipate that when it is perfected, an attempt to charm a too-high level creature will not result in the timer being reset to 72 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
As our charm lines have always been, and always will be, this skill is not for everyone. Kiters will have no use for it, groupers with certain tastes will not care for it. However, the benefit of having a permanent pet that thumps for 140 is something that I like, and it's a bit of fun too.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, when you spend 9 points on Dire Charm, you are not spending those points on healing power, or nuking ability. For most druids, this skill will be a &quot;Nice, but I'll get it after I've bought the skills I really need&quot;. <br />
<br />
I hope that the above post has been a little use; certainly, it is nice to have some information about a skill before you buy it - taking the plunge and just buying a skill unarmed is a little daunting! At the very least, it will help you make up your mind whether or not Dire Charm is any good, or whether it's not the right thing for you. :)<br />

<br />
Send your pet in and let him build that aggro. If your pet loses aggro and you get summoned, run away or circle the mob until pet gets aggro back. If you canot heal your pet before he dies, make sure you gate/egress before pet dies. When you get summoned, you get hit almost immediately. It is hard to cast as you get summoned. <br />

Therei snothing worse than running to zone, getting half way there, then getting summoned back.</div></div><hr />

Ask a mage friend for pet gear making sure the weapons are of 2 different types (note 1 mage weapon and a rusty one is better than 2 mage weapons of the same kind on your pet).  If you have money burning a hole in your pocket buy yourself one of those 36 haste robes casters can wear for more haste.  I have also heard of peeps getting tash and slow weapons along with other gear for their charmed pets but thats up to how much coin you can risk loosing (pet dies or you gate you can kiss it all good bye).  Find yourself a rat to DC and give it pet gear and buff it up as much as possible.  I personally love heading to the basement (the area just before the hand in guy for the flag) Make sure you avoid the big guys in black for they kinda nasty.  Harmony the neighboring mob, snare the mob you are going to kill so it is no longer near the one harmonied and send in pet. Debuff/nuke/heal/root/snare accordingly.  Big thing is not to take on to many mobs since you really dont want them spawning on you at the wrong time.</div></div><hr />

Edit: btw i just noticed you used the phrase &quot;under the impression&quot; as well and did'nt want you to think i was being sarcastic or mean any bad by me using it too =)</div></div><hr />

They are at or just above the DC level cap, so sometimes you may get a resist and have to kill one and try the other.  These furry friends double all the time, can triple and even saw a quad once.  I use these guys all the time when want to do a little Loyalist factioning while LFG.</div></div><hr />

I think by the time you are high enough in level to get DC the mob levels in the Ldon adventures you would be getting would exceed the DC max level of 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormmaster</div><div class="date">09-27-2005, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the wolves in the rujarkian LDON missions are regular charmable.  Way too high for dire charm and only charmable with the lvl 70 charm at my level.  But if LDON mob levels are scaled for those doing the mission I would think the wolves are dire charmable if you are doing them in the mid level ranges.  At level 70 I can confirm they aren't.<br />
 <br />
Also note there is 1 type of charmable mob in each of the 5 ldon types.  The only mobs that are charmable are also the only mobs that cannot be snared.  I'm sure a planned measure to avoid exploiting them because they hit hard and fast and tank quite well so yeild some nice xp but also the risks associated with &quot;charmed&quot; pets.  Dire charm pets are essentially no risk so it would reason that they might make them above the level or tag them non dire charmable for balance sake.<br />

Not sure if any of that helped but there ya go :)</div></div><hr />

A trick I use constantly, especially for non-summoned weapons, is to simply go invis when I am done with the pet. This breaks the charm, and the pet will then attack you. Root/snare/kite whatever you feel like doing to keep it from using the weapons on you, and then kill it. I prefer to root rot the pet. Once it is dead you are able to loot the weapons from the body, and wisk them off to your next pet, the bank, or (I do this mostly for summoned weapons) hand them out to lower toons or drop them around PoK. Hope this helps you other leaf lovers out there.<br />
 <br />
(btw if you are in Dranik's Scar a lot, the rats in the eastern caves make great pets. I use them as tanks all the time when helping to farm both the augs for people)</div></div><hr />

Even in Blackfeather Roost trying to charm a &quot;grey&quot; con cougar or bear at the lowest level gave me the message that the mob was too high for this charm.  Highest con mob (besides captain, queen, and very few upper platform mobs) is light blue.<br />

If anyone does find some DC mobs in TSS, please let us know.</div></div><hr />
