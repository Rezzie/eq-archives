But I've been trying to figure out if the 2 piece set bonus of +200 armor from Wildheart IS multiplied in Bear/Moonkin form. Does anyone know for sure? I've seen mixed reports... maybe it changed in a patch, or maybe people just make assumptions and say it like they actually know. Anyone tested it?<br />

Thanks</div></div><hr />

(Rogue T0) gear and Wildheart gear and switch out to get the best benefits. In cat form I wear the chest, bracers, legs and belt from the Shadow set to get the 2/4 and 4/4 benefits, plus the boost to my crit, dodge and attack power. For the Wildheart set I wear the head, shoulders, gloves and boots to gain an additional 2/4 and 4/4 benefits (gain +200 armor from Wild and +200 Shadow and the rage/energy bonus from both sets). I switch to full Wildheart when in caster form for the obvious boost to casting.</div></div><hr />
