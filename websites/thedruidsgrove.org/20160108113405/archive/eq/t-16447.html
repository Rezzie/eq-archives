 <br />
I am well undergeared, and at a loss as where to go and what to do.<br />
 <br />
What would be good zones to solo in now at 66? Please consider my outdated gear as well.<br />
 <br />
I have heard some people like monster missions, but I'm not sure how to do those, or how they work. Could someone explain them? Where they start, etc?<br />
 <br />
What is an easy way to get gear? Obviously not raid gear, but stuff I can get or work on that's an upgrade for now until I can get to 80.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

You can also try your luck in icefall or direwind and see if there ppl on an armor mob and get lucky leather mold is rotting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ohioastro</div><div class="date">12-05-2007, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd start by solo kiting in Tipt.  You can also do well in the Steppes and Sunderrock.  There are a variety of missions to go around that enable you to pick up assorted, and fairly powerful, nonvisible slot items.  DoN missions (with crystal rewards) yield very nice groupable augments, especially for resists.  You can make considerable plat with tradeskill drops in 65-70 level zones, and save up for the new cultural armor.  Once geared up a bit, TBS group gear (or, again, faction grinding + tradeskill component farming + buying currency in the bazaar for Katta gear) will be viable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're going to solo then Vxed is easier than Tipt as mentioned above, then move on to the Steppes / Icefall etc.<br />
<br />
Charm kiting mammoths in Icefall will be the best easy / rapid way to xp once you get the upgraded charm spell<br />
<br />
Much hunting is currently being done in the new expansion's zones, so you won't have much competition for static content in the older stuff.<br />
<br />
Don't know what server you're on, but if you're on AB send me a pm here or a tell in game and I'll spot you some cash to get some gear if you're really stuck</div></div><hr />

<br />
The good news is that mobs drop more pp loot too, so it wont take long to raise some cash for upgrades.</div></div><hr />

If you're going to take an extended break from the game, invest in fungi tunics! :)<br />
<br />
Charming is easily the best option for soloing.  If you're out of practice, I suggest starting somewhere easy even if the exp isn't as good.  Loroks in the Plane of Storms might be a good option.  (I know there are plans to smooth out the transation in exp between 5 levels below you and 6 levels below you; if this has gone in, then the loroks--which are always level 60--might be a decent option to get some practice in.)</div></div><hr />

lvl 65 dru myself, and I really have to work on soloing skills. <br />
Been trying to solo in Gorukar Mesa but mobs can be hard to root or snare, and they seem to have a lot of hp, my dots hardly makes any difference :frown: <br />
 <br />
- What is this &quot;upgraded charm spell&quot; Elligen talks about?<br />
- How good is the DoN crystal snare? Can I safely use it in Steppes/Sunderrock/DW/Vxed/Tipt etc without it gets resisted too often? (Don't say it's worthless, I've already bought it ;) )<br />
- Is charmkiting more effective than dotting/nuking?<br />
 <br />
Pix, Halls of Honor is hot zone for 65+ (or something like that) so this is a good place to go if you want to group. Glowing Hoop of the Silverwing (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=70803) which drops there, was a welcome upgrade for me, but you might have better =)<br />
 <br />
Also, be sure to visit the Librarian Hemfar (1st floor) and Master Vanguard Regan (2nd floor) in Crescent Reach. Regan hands out a 18 step augment quest, most of it soloable, and resulting in a +75 hp/mana (plus other stats) augm, the Wanderlust Guildstone (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3680). <br />
 <br />
The librarian has a hand in quest: Charm of Lore (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52354). Basically, throughout TSS zones there will drop various items that he wants. After handing in 5 of them, you will get a charm. The following hand ins will increase the stats. Lots of the items are soloable at our lvl, the last items requires TSS raids. Maxed, the charm is +495 hp/mana with hp/mana regen and other stats too. <br />
 <br />
DoD has some good things as well, for example the DoD Resist Clickies (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3264), results in +50 DR/PR/FR/CR/MR instant clickies which can be combined into one clicky. It's 4-5 missions for each clicky and you will need a group for each mission. <br />
 <br />
Good luck!<br />

 <br />
The one from doing don progression is better but the vendor one is nice also.<br />
 <br />
If I were returning I would go to all the old hotzones and grab the hotzone augs and deck out my self with those augs as most old players did not have augs filled in or used wis 6 or sv fire 7 augs etc.<br />
 <br />
hps/mana is in alot of those current and old hotzones.</div></div><hr />
