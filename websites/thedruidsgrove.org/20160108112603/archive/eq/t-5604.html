<br />
I was just idly curious, how many druids spend most of thier time on a raid.  Key being most.  Is there one area that you spend more time doing then the others.<br />
<br />
1) Part of CH Rotation on Mt<br />
2) Spotting MT<br />
3) Healing Off Tank/Rampage Tank<br />
4) Healing your group<br />
5) DPS<br />
6) I do 2 or more of them really equally.  I dont have a most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My own strength is nuking, but that's mainly because it's a personal preference, my guild has lots of druids, and the other druids like healing.<br />

<br />
Of course, the main cleric still tries to cover him ...<br />

But on all raids, my primary responsibility is ... ML.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I hate raiding.  Perhaps, if we move beyond trivial raid content, I might actually get to contribute something.</div></div><hr />

so i get to heal/cure group and debuff mob and occassional DPS thrown in there.</div></div><hr />

Vish - group healing<br />
Mata - patch healing<br />
Tacvi - dps a lot of the time<br />
Demiplane - just about everything on that list<br />

Pretty much whatever the situation warrants doing!</div></div><hr />

Now on a raid, I primarily heal (and never, ever have to ML!).  I'm either healing a group, assigned to a specific tank, or assist healing.  Raiding is a lot more enjoyable now that I'm doing what I love most.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monday night in Simon Says, I got to do the other thing I love most.  DoT the mobs!  Yay Simon!<br />

Raiding is a lot more fun in challenging content.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rowaan</div><div class="date">07-26-2006, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it depends largely on the encounter and on how many clerics (or other healing classes) are raiding that evening. AoE means I'm deciding who gets to die in a pinch, low on healers means I'm watching the main tank's health like a hawk... it really varies. High on healers means dotting and nuking (the fun stuff!). But recently I've been doing a lot of spot healing, either my group of the main tank - when I'm not looting my own corpse, of course. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">01-19-2007, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two or more, no dominant area is going to be overwhelming, because what you do during a raid is largely based on needs of the raid for the specific raid target you are going after, and how many healers are in the raid.<br />
 <br />
If you are going after a single target melee type mob, you are going to nuke trash more than likely until you get to the bad guy and on the main raid mob, you'll nuke or patch heal on the MT as the raid needs.<br />
 <br />
But if you are fighting some mob that throws some detrimental AE, you are probably going to heal group, or cure MT as the raid requires.<br />
 <br />
The question needs to be more specific to bet a better poll result.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes with an off-tank present. Fun huh? But I still find time to do debuffs, dots, nukes and spot heals. So yeah, I do whatever is required at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akilah</div><div class="date">02-03-2007, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the only thing I don't do on a raid is DPS. The exception being at timeswe are called on to DoT a mob and then back to healing. I also use Sun's Corona to debuff ATK on the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oaklie</div><div class="date">02-12-2007, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This depends of what part of the raid.<br />
<br />
On named, I debuff named for atk, fire and/or ice depending on the mob and resists. Then swing into healing mode usually. Sometimes I am spot healing the MT, sometimes I'm on off tanks. All depends on who is in my group and what is required for the raid.<br />
If everything is going well and I'm not needed much on healing, I'll stack a couple of dots and through in some nukes, while keeping an eye on HoTT and being ready to switch to healing at any moment.<br />
WE NEVER EVER USE DRUIDS IN CH ROTATION.<br />
<br />
On trash, it's dps full boar. Only time I heal on trash mobs is if we get to many.</div></div><hr />
