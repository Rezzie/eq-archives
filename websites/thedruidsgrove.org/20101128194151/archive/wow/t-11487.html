Which stat....str or agility is better if I had to pick one? My agility is high but my str really isnt.<br />
But if I can get an enchant that adds like 26 Attack power....is that better than +15 agility?<br />
Is there a set formula?<br />
Do Str and Agility only add to Attack Power...or other things also.....how do the two stats differ?</div></div><hr />

Can't remember if that is all STR increases. AGI will increase your AP by 1 per agi point but it also adds a bit of crit, dodge (and armor) as well. Attack power well, adds attack power.<br />
<br />
The formula goes (for maximum AP) like this:<br />
Focus on STR until 1200 AP and then focus on AGI because at that point AGI becomes equal to STR in terms of AP and it also includes bonuses such as dodge and crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are referring to the Enchant Goves &quot;Assault&quot; enchant right?  (or was that bracers...)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that there is also a +12 str enchant for that same slot that would end up giving you more overal AP. Personally I'm sitting at 1616 AP and 29% crit in dps gear with just MOTW, its probably time for me to start focusing more on agility.</div></div><hr />

Str and +AP add to attack power in bear form... of course you high crit in bear form for extra rage and threat.  Str only adds 2AP per str in bear form.  HotW increases stamina rather than strength.<br />
<br />
One of these days I need to read up on the new enchants... of course I'm not going to worry about them until my gear becomes more stable.  I'm replacing it left and right.</div></div><hr />

Agility = 1 AP in both cat and bear form.  Str = 2 AP in both forms as well.<br />
HotW increases strength in cat form<br />
HotW increases stamina in bear form</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alas, no. Agi only adds to AP in cat. In bear, agi will add to armour and crit.<br />
<br />
See the formulas page on WoWwiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Attack_Power).</div></div><hr />

Imo, great when you act as hybrid in a 5 man party. Usually use this set for grinding aswell, I like to feel the comfort of the hybrid.<br />
<br />
Also have a collection of 'rogue' pieces, that mainly got agi, stam + fixed AP for tanking-only jobs.<br />
<br />
Correct me if Im wrong here but; <br />
As I've understood, the hit/crit/dodge etc. % is the amount towards a enemy of your'e equal lvl? In other words, these numbers decrease when you lvl (unless you upgrade equipment at a equal pace). <br />
I've had dodge/crit leaning towards or above 30% at 60, but now at 70 its leaning towards 20% :(<br />
Question I have is, does this effect the 1200 AP rule??<br />
<br />
Elyrian, ty for the link, was the numbers I was looking for :)</div></div><hr />
