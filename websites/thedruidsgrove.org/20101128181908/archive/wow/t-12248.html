I've never posted my armory page here before, because it's always been just a little too embarrassing, but now I really don't know what I should do to improve my hit rating or if I should compromise other stats to do so. I tend to stack agility in my enchants and gems, but would be willing to reduce my agi if the advice of you wise feral druids suggests I do so for more +hit.<br />
<br />
I'm in Kara with my guild; we have Shade on farm and beat our heads against the wall on Prince and his infernal infernals pretty regularly these days. I've been doing a fair bit of PvP lately (as you can see from my gear), but it's slow going since my arena points are coming from a 2v2 team.<br />
<br />
So, without further ado, here it is (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Malfurion&amp;n=Avearis). Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try wowhead for some +hit pieces you could get or maybe socket some more +hit gems.<br />
When raising your +hit try not to gimp your other stats (especially if you're tanking too).</div></div><hr />

I have the Gloves and Shoulders for my DPS Cat Suit and that (along with the Ravenclaw Band from Sethekk) gives me 63 Hit Rating.<br />
<br />
Add in Boots Of Natural Grace and Shadowprowler's Chestguard (both crafted LW patterns) and I'm sitting at 119 Hit Rating.<br />
<br />
So nice in Cat Form.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the hit cap is 142 hit rating (or something like 8.6% - 9%, I forgot the exact percent).<br />
<br />
What I'd do? Grab some more S3 gear and heroic badge gear. Get a few +4 agi/+4 hit gems, as well. That's really your best option, short of some +hit gear from Kara.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend picking up the +hit/+expertise gear from kara. I don't have the list in front of me, but most of the rogue oriented peices have bunches of +hit on it. As you push further into Kara, you get things like the chest (from Nightbane?) and the legs (from netherspite). 142 to hit and 60 expertise are the caps against level 73 mobs (bosses).<br />
<br />
If you're tanking, I'd worry less about +hit and more about mitigation and survival. Basically, it is the DPS' responsibility to not press you in agro during a battle and it is your job to survive. Ideally, in an ideal world, after you reach 22-25k unbuffed health, 31k armor and are uncrittable, with 45% dodge, then i'd start building +hit/expertise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
22-25K UNbuffed?<br />
<br />
Is this even possible outside of BT/Hyjal?<br />
<br />
I have 21K Raid buffed, 26K Armor and 31% Dodge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
22 - 25k HP outside of MH and BT?  Not sure it can be done unless you're stacking all +stam gems and enchants.<br />
<br />
Crit cap is easy mode<br />
<br />
31k AC takes a few pieces of T4 level gear to attain, but still pretty doable.<br />
<br />
I still tank from time to time, and really never worried about +hit.  Even with the ( lame ) taunt change to being affected by +hit.  <br />
<br />
A few T4 pieces, nice heroic and badge gear and I'm around the 20k hp mark well buffed.  Not sure the 25k hp can be attained then...unless maybe you're looking at a tauren.</div></div><hr />

I very rarely MT anymore. My guild is good to go on MTs. I almost always DPS/OT (my absolute favorite role in WoW), so I'm usually in cat form with my DPS gear on. If a mob(s) I'm OTing hits particularly hard I'll don my tanking gear for that pull, but of course it gimps my DPS. That said, I'm usually #1-3 on DPS in Kara behind a good rogue, DPS warrior or warlock if they come, so I'm not dissatisfied with my output, but our GL is a feral druid recently respecced from Resto whose gear doesn't quite rival mine, and we are always neck and neck in the DPS competition. This is what got me wondering if it's my +hit that's holding me back. I also wonder if it's because I stack agility over strength. If that's the case, it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make because the agi helps with my OT abilities so much.<br />
<br />
At any rate, thanks again for the help. And BTW, Kyane, I did come to you- I posted on TDG :dance:</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way you don't have to spend lots of time and money sorting out new gear.<br />
<br />
Also hit rating is fairly useless in pvp..  as all players are the same level as you (or, if you're really lucky, lower than you..)<br />

Yeah, I just got the recipe for this stuff from the daily cooking quest last week. It's good stuff, and I get leather when I farm the meat too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-12-2007, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, you're wise to stack agility. Agility is better than strength for DPS in every way. So yes, keep stacking that, and get your hit rating to 142, and develop a powershifting rotation while using either Insane Strength or Haste potions, and never use FB over Shred unless in certain circumstances, and.... (it goes on).<br />
<br />
But anyway. Yeah, work on that +hit. Expertise is good, too, but I wouldn't sacrifice other stats to get it... or maybe you should? I stopped checking up vigorously on feral stuff when I stopped raiding. Probably should again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-13-2007, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">expertise is very good, if you have access to it. I roll with 35 expertise rating right now (belt off vashj and shoulders from hydross).<br />
<br />
At the risk of being dependent on online calculators, http://druid.wikispaces.com/ToskksDPSGearMethod, lets look at AP/AGI comparisons. Raid buffed in Kara/SSC gear, I float around 4k AP and 45% crit, ~100ish hit and 25 expertise, everbloom, malorne, relentless earthstorm.<br />
<br />
As you can see, it values +hit and +expertise at the same level, because you're having the same effect, you're decreasing the amount the enemy is not hit. Hit reduces miss chance and expertise reduces dodge chance (we're assuming you're behind and not going to be parried). Thus the vashj belt is technically better for a dpsing druid than anything out of BT, unless you have 80 expertise already (which is no easy feat).<br />
<br />
Note, the shapeshifter's signet is not very good by itself. In order for it to really shine, you need upwards of 8k AP and &lt;50% crit (I've never seen anyone anywhere near that high. And if they did get near that high, they'd assuradly have close to 75% crit, which is the cap, which would make the shapeshifter's signet very poor).<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not rated as high as strength or agility until you're floating around insanely high AP/Crit. <br />
<br />
BTW, i said 60 expertise earlier was the cap. I was mistaken, it's 80 expertise.</div></div><hr />

Expertise and hit rating are nearly equal in how they effect your DPS. If you are already +hit capped, then expertise is definitely a good stat to go for. But because +hit gear is so much more abundant than +expertise, it's probably easier to work on getting +hit capped first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-13-2007, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but if you have a *nice* peice with Expertise drop while raiding, don't hesitate to pick it up. Even if you don't use it right away (because maybe it breaks a set bonus?), you may want it later one. Examples include the gloves off alar or the shoulders from Hydross.</div></div><hr />
