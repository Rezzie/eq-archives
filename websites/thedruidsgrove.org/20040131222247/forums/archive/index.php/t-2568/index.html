<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would like to know how much slots for debuffing a mob has.<br />
<br />
Some people say the slots are limited by number, but my guild never had any issues with that. Anyone got some evidence or did some testing on how many debuffs, spells, dots are able to stack on a mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IIRC Sony made a statement about this when they allowed DOT stacking.  I *think* the number is 15.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Corvalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually I believe they changed it to 30 sometime back. 6 druids with multiple DoT's on a mob can be alot of fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">15 for players...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, i believe it must be more than 30. But i can't find any evidence.<br />
<br />
A while ago, i posted this on my guilds druid classboard:<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://mitglied.lycos.de/otagra/pics/dotten.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border:0;&quot;/&gt;<br />
<br />
Immediately i got some answers like: &quot;Hey, stop it. You are wasting valuable debuff slots on mobs&quot;<br />
<br />
But noone was able to tell me how many &quot;valuable&quot; slots there are. I asked to test it on a Bossmob we were doing with 60 ppl. Every class casted all their available debuffs and dots. Sure, we got some stacking issues. But there was no &quot;point of no more stacking&quot; discovered.<br />
<br />
Anyone else run some tests on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried buffing a dire charmed pet in CoD once.  We got up to 27 buffs before we ran out of things that would stack.  So it's pretty safe to say they have at least 27 slots. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am virtually certain it is 30.  Doesn't take too long on a raid to use those up...<br />
<br />
Malos, slow, cripple, hand of ro, ro's illumination, ec'is, and then like 4 necros and 4 shaman stacking their dots.<br />
<br />
Druids in my guild never dot on raids because we always run out of debuff slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SuburbanLife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is 30 debuff slots for mobs, 110% sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tendalus Treepimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Does this count towards mob buffs too?<br />
<br />
I.e. if a mob buffs it self, is that less debuffs you can drop without dispelling it first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Debuffs should just overwrite buffs that they get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mobs (de)buff slots work the same as players they just have 30 of them rather than 15.  Frankly I have never seen a boss mob run out of slots in a raid.  Not sure how often people DoT but alot of the time it just isn't worth the time involved.</div></div><hr />
