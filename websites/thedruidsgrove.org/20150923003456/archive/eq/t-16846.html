When your group is ready hail Billik and the event will begin. Mobs will begin to pop in 1-3 at random locations, usually in the shrub northwest of the village, over the ridge north of the village, northeast of the village, under the docks west of the village, behind the rock south of the village, and inside the buildings of the villages. Kill everything before anything is corruption (trackers get a failure in track window if this happens). Eventually the waves end and you get credit, then there is a non-interactive event. When that is done go hail Billik and then Captain to finish the mission. <br />

The Dread Challenger <br />
Received from Captain Hiran Tillin, say work. (Must do Stop the Contamination) *Group Mission - YOU NEED A TRACKER* <br />
Speak to the white robed NPC next to him to be transported to the village in an instance Oceangreen Village. <br />
You will be rushed by 9 mobs from the North that you must kill and also have a mob pop like it did in the last mission. If you don't kill the 9 you will have to distract the mobs that pop around the village as well as kill the 9 because you will have to deal with waves again like in Stop the Contamination, same spawn points. At some point in the waves you will get a named called Nacakehoth the Reviled (He popped behind the rock south of village) who at some point summon a group of mobs to help him on low health. After him a few more waves and you are done. Then you get again a non-interactive event. Then hail Billik to exit the mission and hail Captain to finish it.<br />
