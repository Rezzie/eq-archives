My base build would be this (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZZxVcxcq0eot).<br />
<br />
For daily/grinding I often see Resto's put their remaining 19 points in Balance.  Since I have a good Kitty set now, why not something like this 0/19/42 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZE0McbbZxVcxcq0eot) build?  Or should I bit the bullet and put my 19 points into balance like this 19/0/42 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0t0ruaZZxVcxcq0eot) build?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, if you're going to go with the points in balance, you might as well get Natural Perfection to buff your crit chance (as it affects all spells).<br />
<br />
I think it's more of a style choice when it comes to balance vs. feral for solo.  Personally, I found it very difficult to go from soloing as a cat while feral to soloing as a cat while resto.  Your call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">03-20-2008, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled feral, so I always kept my extra points in my feral tree and carried around my feral set and threw that on while I was soloing or doing dailies.  <br />
<br />
As my resto set was building quite nicely, I decided to re-spec and put my extra points into Balance.  I figured that way I'd at least have more room in my bags (no feral set to carry around), plus I'd never really tried my balance abilities.  <br />
<br />
Gotta tell ya, I was quite pleasantly surprised!  I'm loving it!  Balance skills are fun, I can solo quite efficiently, and I very rarely run out of mana. <br />
<br />
I never thought I'd say this, but I miss my paws less and less every day.   Mind you, I still upgrade my feral set if the opportunity presents itself.  :wink:</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking respeccing and putting my feral points to balance for exactly the same reasons (bag space becoming an issue!) I'm glad that it's a move that's worked out for you.... hope I benefit from it too :)<br />

Lots of +spell dmg on healing gear nowadays.  I didn't want to have to carry around an entirely separate set for feral.</div></div><hr />

I've found Improved Tranq. to be useful in a tight spot in instances.</div></div><hr />
