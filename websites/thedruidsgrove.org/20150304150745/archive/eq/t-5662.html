<br />
I won't go into a detailed writeup since that has already been done here by KyrosKrane:<br />
<br />
http://www.gamesnet.org/KyrosKrane/Oracle/#Mana%20Crystals<br />
<br />
<br />
Quick Summary:  You get 6 books from a variety of places and mobs.  The books are all droppable, and can be purchased (but prices are high).  Some of the mobs can be soloed by a level 65 druid, some require a group/mini-raid, depending on who you have with you.<br />
<br />
1) Tome of Miragul - An Ancient Construct deep in the Hole. <br />
<br />
2) History of the Di`Zok - Loremaster Piza`tak in Chardok library (past the first locked doors).<br />
<br />
3) Journal of Aataltaal - Estrella of Gloomwater in Kedge Keep.<br />
<br />
4) Firebone Notebook - Aramin the Spider Guardian in the Plane of Disease.<br />
<br />
5) Sanguine Tome - A Tae Ew Bloodfiend in Cazic-Thule.<br />
<br />
6) Velketor's Spellbook - Velketor the Sorcerer in Velketor's Laboratory.<br />
<br />
You turn the 6 books in to the assistant of the Oracle of K'Arnon in OOT.   As you turn the books in, you get tradeskill components to make a Phylactery (see below).  After the sixth, you get a token.  You give the token AND your velious quest BP (i.e., the ones from Kael/Thurg/SS only) to a halfling on the aviak island in the middle of OOT to get the Grand Tunic.<br />
<br />
If you do the tradeskill part (which requires several combines using different skills, and additional no drop components from various mobs in various locations), then the final combine gives you:<br />
<br />
Phylactery<br />
Slot: Range<br />
Effect: Soul Clasp (Casting time: Instant)<br />
Str-10 sta-10 wis+10 int+10 hp-50 mana+50<br />
Wt: 0.4 Size: Tiny<br />
All/All<br />
<br />
You can turn the above into the assistant to get <br />
<br />
Dark Phylactory<br />
Range<br />
AC10<br />
Effect: Regeneration (Instant) , targetable<br />
Str-10 Sta-10 Wis+10 Int+10 -50hps +50mana<br />
0.4wgt<br />
ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
<br />
Both of the effects are CAST, and you can trigger them from inventory.  Soul Clasp gives +2 mana regen, -2 HP per tick, and does not stack with effects like Lunar Whispers, but does stack with FT items.   So a nice effect for those with greater than 2 natural regen (or who have Regrowth or other regen up constantly).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">11-18-2003, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I consider it an upgrade.  Your total HP will increase with the Grand Oracle Tunic, of course, as will your total mana and wis (if you aren't already capped).  The FT IV effect is very nice, and as a constant effect is better than the ornate.   Your AC will go down a little bit, but it won't be significant in most cases.   I keep the ornate in my pack to reclick regen when needed.<br />
<br />
There are several BPs that are better, of course.   But the ornate is not one of them.<br />
<br />
Whether it is worth the effort depends on your circumstances.   Three of the mobs were fairly easy to solo (the Ancient Construct, the Bloodfiend, and Estrella), while the rest can take a group (more or less) or more, depending on levels, equipment, AAs and skills of the people making the attempt.  Or, if you have the plat, you can just buy one or more of the books.  I have seen prices in the 15K to 30K range (per book).</div></div><hr />

Ancient Burrower Hide Tunic: Wt 1.00. +50 AC, +10 Str, +15 Sta, +10 Wis, +10 Int, +8 vsMg, +8 vsFire, +8 vsCold, +8 vsPos, +8 vsDis, +50 HP, +50 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Flowing Thought V.   Classes: Ro B Sk P C D Sm Ra Bl. All Races. <br />
<br />
<br />
One more FT and 30 more AC.   Substantially less wis, mana, and HP.  Slightly lower resistances.   I'm over the FT cap already, so the additional FT of the Burrower tunic would be useless for me, and I prefer the higher HP and mana over AC.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'd say the Grand Oracle Tunic was much easier to get, as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
The BPs I'd replace this with are limited:  <br />
<br />
Kerasha's Sylvan Tunic: Wt 9.00. +45 AC, +20 Str, +25 Sta, +25 Agi, +10 Dex, +30 Wis, +15 Cha, +20 vsMg, +20 vsFire, +20 vsCold, +20 vsPos, +20 vsDis, +185 HP, +200 Mana,  Stun Resist: +7%,   Specialize Alteration: +8%,   LORE MAGIC NODROP Focus Effect of Wrath of E'ci (35% to cold DD).

<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd consider the Immaculate Vest, but only if I really didn't need the FT and needed the MP (which I already have on another slot):<br />
<br />
Immaculate Vest of the Fire Tyrant: Wt 2.50. +45 AC, +25 Str, +20 Sta, +20 Dex, +25 Wis, +10 Cha, +30 vsMg, +30 vsCold, +150 HP, +150 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of Vengeance VII.

<br />
<br />
I'll explain again if you give me a cupcake...:)<br />
<br />
First, if you just want the new tunic, all you need to do is collect the 6 books.  You turn them in, one at a time, to a quest NPC in OOT near the Oracle.   Among other things (tradeskill components that you don't need to worry about), you get a Token after turning in the 6th book (which is the one from Velk).   Run over to the halfling on the aviak island in OOT, and hand him the Token plus a velious quest BP.  In return, he gives you the Grand Oracle Robe.  That's it.<br />
<br />
In essence, this is a way to upgrade your velious quest BP (one of the velious BPs that you got from the Kael, Thurg or SS questgivers).  You lose the velious quest BP, of course, because you turn it in.<br />
<br />
Second, if you want the Phylactery (for the castable FT 2 buff), you need to turn in all 6 books as above, and then do a series of tradeskill combines using no drop components that the NPC gives you with each book turn in.   To do these combines, you also need to obtain other components from various mobs, such as the Soul Anchor from the Ghoul of Takish-Hiz, a rare mob in Oasis or the Ros.   You can fail these combines, which should result in 6 components to the phylactery.  You place all 6 inside a box the NPC gives you for a no-fail combine to make the Phylactery.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the first version of the Phylactery, you can give it to the NPC to swap to the Dark Phylactery version (with castable regen effect).   If you change your mind, give the dark version to the NPC to get the first version back.<br />
<br />
You can skip all the tradeskilling stuff if you just want the Grand Tunic.  However, the Phylactery effect is very nice, since it is a spell buff and not limited by the FT 15 cap.  You need to have at least 165 (modified) skill in the six different tradeskills to do each particular combine.</div></div><hr />

No augmentation slots. <br />
So it's the equivalent of a 60 hp tunic, not a 100 hp one?  Ewww.  Ornate is better unless you need the FT.  Can't get enough of that click regen, and I'm too lazy to be swapping gear all the time.</div></div><hr />

With the advent of ornate bracers + LDON augments, FT isnt quite the problem it used to be for non-raiding players.    I think you can get a much better BP out of LDON or questionably Ornate.   I'll hold on to my lunar fungi for now ;p.   That said, I might still do the quest for the right click but some of the components are a pain, especially from the mini-raid mobs.   <br />
<br />
As a side note, would have been nice to put soul clasp on Signet of Arcane, instead of yet another item with preservation of xegony.   Its frustrating how rare right click mana items are, and an item requiring much lower tradeskills results in a more useful effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) MQing the BP, + someone's token<br />

<br />
2) Turning in say Silk Robe, or Plate/Chain BP or does it have to be the druid BP?<br />

<br />
Even without the Aug slot.  It's still a better BP than anything besides Judgement, Time, or Fennin's Immaculate.<br />
<br />
If your hp fiend its 60 hps ((vs loss 40 hp motd) but still a whopping 120 Mana, Good Resists<br />
<br />
If your a mana fiend its 100 hps 80 Mana, still good.<br />

<br />
Tils, I don't think the tradeskill stuff is too high (not Aid Grimel/Signet of the Arcane quest level); for example, I know the smithing portion is level restricted to like 160ish or something...<br />
<br />
Look on Kryos' page...he'll have the tradeskill lvl requirements...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last I saw, the tradeskills minimum was close to 165 (unmodified).  So you could be a little bit lower than that and use a Geerlok.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll hold on to my lunar fungi for now ;p.  <br />
<br />
Lunar Fungus Covered Tunic: Wt 2.00. +25 AC, +10 vsMg, +10 vsFire, +10 vsCold, +10 vsPos, +10 vsDis, +100 HP, +100 Mana, MAGIC NODROP Effect of Fungal Regrowth.   Classes: D C P Sk B Mk Ro Wr Sm Ra Bl. All Races. Dropped by Va Xi Aten Ha Ra.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think the Lunar Fungi is a superior BP.   The Grand Oracle Tunic has more mana (and wis, if you're not capped) and more HP (if you not sta capped).   I'll take FT over regen any day (even if you're above the FT cap already, FT IV can free up other slots that you now have FT in).<br />
<br />
Of course, if you already have the Lunar Fungi, and are saying the upgrade is relatively minor for someone who doesn't need FT and thus may not be worth the effort of doing the quest, that may be true.   However, I do believe the Grand Oracle Tunic would be much easier to get for most folks.<br />
<br />
BTW, even if the GOT never gets an augment slot, I'd still take it over the ornate.   Because the click effect of the ornate is a spell with some duration, the end result is that the ornate BP, as a practical matter, has no &quot;effect&quot; while worn.   I prefer to maximize my slots with focus and worn effects as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Thus, even assuming the GOT never has an augmentation slot, if you use the augmentation slot on the ornate for 40 hp, you still have a BP without a practical worn effect.   As I think Tudamorf has pointed out in the past, worn effects generally are superior to any stat increases.</div></div><hr />

no, it's the equivalent of a 100hp tunic.  not everyone is going to waste their time in ldon for 40hp augs.  100hp is 100hp however you get it.<br />

If I have to start doing some annoying gear swap to cast it, it defeats the purpose of having the effect in the first place -- convenience.  Might as well do two quick /mem commands and cast the actual spell.<br />
<br />
As for burning endless hours in LDoN, it's more like a few days, and at the same time, you get good single group entertainment, loot for your entire group, good XP, cash, dropped items, and tradeskill components.  I can't think of another zone that offers the same bang for the buck, and I hardly call that &quot;wasted&quot; time, although I'm sure I'll get some uber jumping in saying how boring and pointless it is since it doesn't require 70 people sitting on their asses for 12 hours at a time.  &lt;img src=http://lag9.com/rolleyes.gif&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">11-19-2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem with LDON is that it still takes too much time....time to get a group together (if you can), time to get prepped, time to actually be at the keyboard while in the dungeon.   It's why I haven't done a LDON adventure in about a month, and why I probably won't do another one until I can solo.  (Or perhaps I might try to hook up with two level 57 folks just to get a LDON instance started, and seeing how far I can get soloing anyway....:)<br />
<br />
In any event, if you buy the books or obtain them from a friend, it's a helluva lot faster than doing LDON, of course.  If you acquire the books by killing the mobs, it still is faster than the LDON route, and doesn't require the same level of time commitment.  I'd estimate that getting any book would take less than the time to get a group formed, prepped, and through an average LDON adventure (killing Aramin is a lot easy than doing a LDON adventure, in my opinion).   That includes the 3 or 4 books that you can effectively solo as a level 65 druid.  When I was doing some of those, for example, I'd log in, kill the PHer, log out for 15 to 25 min (or however long it took until repop).   During the down time, I'd go do something else.   Can't do that during a LDON adventure.<br />
<br />
Besides, you really don't have to forego the 40-hp augmentation with the GOT.  Just stick it in another equipment slot.   The only time it becomes a significant issue is if all your other slots are already filled up with 40-hp (or equivalent) augmentations, so the only slot left is the one on your BP.   <br />
<br />
So it's not really the effort to do a couple of days of LDON adventuring to get the first augmentation that you should be considering.  It's that effort multiplied by 6 to 8....:O</div></div><hr />

Anyway, to each thier own.  But many people would still switch out for the click, for the efficiency gain.</div></div><hr />

The mana cost is irrelevant.  Blessing of Replenishment lasts over half an hour for me, and I can meditate back the mana in a few ticks.<br />

= 13 keystrokes minimum to mem regen and go back to your old spellset, assuming you have spellsets designed for 1 letter access. <br />
Actually, I would do it with a single keystroke using a macro (/pause,/mem a - /cast # - /pause,/mem b), since all those functions &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be done with a macro whereas tunic swapping can't if you don't cheat.  One keystroke is a hell of a lot easier than a bunch of annoying mouse movements -- and any mouse movement is extremely annoying while boxing.</div></div><hr />

Or have a wizzy take ya there to bind.<br />
<br />
Estrella's easy solo, with or without a DC'd seahorse.... <br />
<br />
Loremaster should be fairly simple solo, at 65.  haven't done it yet, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">11-26-2003, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Estrella's the easiest.  Just have decent MR and FR since she'll spend most of her time casting. <br />
<br />
Bloodfiend and Ancient Construct were fairly similar in my mind.  With both, you're going to spike up and put yourself in a corner to stop movement so as to minimize interruptions, and you'll need to heal yourself with NI during the fight.   DoT or Nuke as you wish.  You may want to have SotW up and ready to go (it adds nicely to the spike damage).  Also, being able to start with WoW3 and then have it up for casting during the fight helps as well.   Hardest part about the AC is getting to where the PHers spawn in the Hole.  You can camo and fight down solo like I did, or get some friends to go along and help get you in place.<br />
<br />
The Loremaster also should be soloable after you get past the locked door, depending on your faction and your equipment/skills.   If you don't have the right faction, you'll have to deal with up to 4 adds there in the same small area.  Several of the mobs in the library do see through invis...:)</div></div><hr />

Does it have to be a finished piece, or would the pre-turnin tunic work.  Hoping the latter because I don't really wanna make the giants love me yet again.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Bah, would obviously have to be the finished item or else there would be no worries about caster/priest part.  Since every chest slot item can be made into one of these.  Going to go rest my poor tired brain now, ignore this post =P<br />

1. Go to Befallen-kill excavators until a foreman pops... hail the foreman and say &quot;I will go to felwithe&quot;<br />
2. Go to the Paladin guild in felwithe and there's a 3-hour spawn there (this got tedious and LONG once people started trying to form lines and ninja it) that you turn in the token you got from the foreman<br />
3. Take the item you get to somebody in OOT and they give you a phylactery (this mob was perma-killed)<br />

I never got the foreman to spawn before they killed the quest, but on FV it was a droppable item and they sold for 200k+</div></div><hr />

You can only turn in priest/int caster bps, but it doesn't have to be the right type. Turn in a necro robe, and you'll get the tunic, not robe.<br />
<br />
Question then...  ***edit*** nm - got my eroded, got my FT4 - yea<br />
<br />
If I don't have a velious tunic yet (I skipped that and went for elysian) and I get a corroded tunic, can I turn that in for say a cleric BP (even if i'm a druid). <br />
<br />
I've been trying for the eroded leather for weeks with no luck. It took less time to get the 6 books. I have collected over 12 other Thurg drops and seen 4 times that many drop in these weeks. Just no leather tunic. <br />
<br />
I let a shammy loot a torn silk robe so I could prolly get that MQ with the emeralds if this works. So I'd have to MQ to get the necro rode and turn it in for the GOT?</div></div><hr />

As of now, it seems like this is obsolete with the DoN cultural armor and DoN augs. The grandmaster chest aug is pretty cheap in the baz (seen as low as 34k) and is more or less as good as this tunic without considering other augs that you can add to it. Check my magelo for the stats on the DoN one...before laughing at how poor my gear remains. :P<br />

Still does amaze me how quickly neat gear like this becomes obsolete, but still if I tried to get it solo it would take me forever!<br />
