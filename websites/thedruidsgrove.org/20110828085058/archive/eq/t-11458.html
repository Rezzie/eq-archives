For 500k, I could make you a god among newbies.  hehe.</div></div><hr />

Is good stuff fairly well balanced all the way around as far as resists,stats,hp,mana for the level you can wear it at. In fact wouldnt be a bad for you to work your tradeskills up as you level since each of the 4 levels from lowest to highest each has a different set of required/recommended levels and all are fairly decent for their level. By doing this you could save yourself some plat for buying better highend gear once you are 65+. Also is a great way to make money once your skills are high enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wanderinglefty</div><div class="date">06-06-2005, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good grief for level 13 your pretty much god like now lol.  I think you are set up great for now tho, you can afford to just level, and watch the bazaar for a good deal deal, no rush on buying.  Bide your time.<br />
<br />
Do you have a horse or dogmar? You won't need one yet but say 30ish to 40ish if you group would be good for the mana regen, in the zones where they can be used. Like free kei almost. <br />
<br />
Maybe some things to give you ideas<br />
<br />
the mace you have is fine for now but heres one that used to be popular<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19349<br />
<br />
cheap braclet item-maybe even you could camp it yourself as upgrade dunno.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=809<br />
<br />
another nice braclet item but nodrop do have to camp it. just maybe an idea for later.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=803<br />
<br />
might replace one ring with one of these, dont get it for the thorns tho, only 3 charges and usually sold without anways.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18206<br />
<br />
I may be strange but I really like this one below for the resists.  All depends on where you hunting however.  I did alot of ldons where disease/poisen was an issue but if you don't do that, money for wasted stats.  +100 mana not bad tho.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4186<br />
<br />
you wont need right away but these are useful even if you have the underwater breathing spell... you link dead underwater, spell wears off and not wearing something like this ...corpse run been there done that.<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1925<br />
<br />
I dont think you can use the vambraces yet but when you can ... they are nice. only draw back is when you outlevel them and they dont do enough damgage anymore.  If you can get a good deal on these I'd buy. but you have time to watch.  I got mine for free as a gift.  can be clickeyed and swapped back for your other armor in fight.<br />

springwood club, another good one at cheap price.<br />
for just thumping its one of the best because of the speed on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wanderinglefty</div><div class="date">06-06-2005, 03:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok I cant think of things all at once today.. i lookeded at your bags there is no stat food in them.  are you useing the stat foods?<br />
<br />
force feed regular foods, then use the stat foods.  If you've played much at all you already know what i'm talking about.  If not you'll need some more info on this.<br />
<br />
Its cheapest upgrade for the buck right now for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">06-06-2005, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wanderinglefty, the mace is cool but being low level the benefits he'd recieve right now are shoddy at best...  The proc won't work till level 40, too :/  Supple scale armband is a good idea, decent low level stats and range focus are great.  Instead of Ring of Thunderous spirits, if you said you have money, try going with Djarn's Amethyst Ring.  Pretty good stats and no recommended level are the win.  I used a bone-handled scimmy, but the emerald dawn is just as good as 100 mana kicks :) hough the bone handled doesn't have the high numbers, the stats are more spread out, whichI think helps more.  Fishbone earring is okay, but Lodizal Shell Shield are selling pretty cheap these days.  If not, grab a section of Lodizals Shell and 1000 GP and head to Cobalt Scar yourself to do the quest ( http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1206 ).  The ES Vambraces DoT clicky won't work till level 45, and there are much better low level arms out there for now :P<br />
<br />
Sorry to pick apart that post, making twinks is something I put a lot of time into and I like to see it done with flare =P<br />

Arms:  http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7132<br />

Golden Efreeti Boots:  Who doesn't have a set of GEB's! hehe.  AC 5, 9 WIS/INT, Enchantment Haste II<br />

Ring: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19273<br />
Coral Ring: Always a good choice.  7 WIS/AGI, 40 HP/mana, 7 Save Fire/Magic.<br />
<br />
There are a shmorgisboard of good shield out there, too.  I can't remember the name offhand but one is the result of a quest in Luclin and it has like 20 wisdom on it and some saves...  Not too expensive.  It's droppable too, so you'll find it for sale in the bazaar a lot.<br />
<br />
There are also a lot of drops coming from Nobles Causeway and Walls of Sloughter that would be good for you.  Most of them have recommended levels, so you would not get the 100% benefits right away, but you'd grow into them.  For instance, there's a wrist drop and a mask drop that you could wear from a camp in NC that I'm parked at a lot.  I usually tribute the items because they sell so poorly, you could find them for sale for 1-2k sometimes, usually less.  For instance, Earring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31276), Face (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32341)...<br />

<br />
Yea the lodizal shell is better eb item, i didnt know the price was down on it.<br />
<br />
I was ghetto to long lol gear like he has now with only couple upgrades got me to the 50s.  <br />
<br />
Is umbral plains even worth going to now for armor at 50s or should new druids go someplace else I've had couple as me for ideas and i mentioned UP but not sure if that was good idea if they had the expansions</div></div><hr />

Then grab a friend and get some Elysian gear.  Sad thing is, though, by that time you'll probably have had a chance to browse the bazaar a lot more and you will find many things that offer you much better benefits than the elysian gear.  If you do go the elysian route, that is a pretty good set of gear and should last you until your late 40's or early 50's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Storms</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done alot of researching on the various armor upgrades you guys have posted (thanks for those, by the way) and it's looking like the consensus is to  pile up on the wisdom and mana. I've made notes and am currently watching the prices in the bazaar closely.  Alot of your upgrades are a bit out of my lvl range, but as I continue to watch prices, I'll be lvling at the same time and be better able to use the items. <br />
At my current lvl of 14, I do alot of melee fighting; gotta love the damage shields we get. Heheh  Should I start doing more of the root/dot/dd fighting or continue on the way I'm going. Bearring in mind of course, that I pretty much run solo most of the time.<br />
Thanks again for all the responses. You guys rock! :rolling:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wanderinglefty</div><div class="date">06-09-2005, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fighting is fine at your current level.  You can melee quite a bit up to the 20s.  After that you will need to mostly be a spell caster.  <br />
<br />
Melee'in now is not bad, because it will build up your offense and defense skills.  You may need to go to a safe spot and cast spells on yourself to exercise your spells so they go up.  Of course you get the points for leveling but I still like to cast spells on myself building up skills to conserve the points for other stuff.  It's boring but .. can do it while watching tv or something. To each their own tho.<br />
<br />
I notice your Obulus Death Shroud has mana preservation III and the Platnium Armband has mana preserve I.  I don't believe that stacks so, if the shroud effect is working you can upgrade on the armband.  cast a spell and read your spam message.  If it says something about your Obulus Shroud glowing or operateing or doing something that means you are getting the benefit of that items focus effect and could consider an armband upgrade.  <br />
<br />
The armband has good wis stats on it the only drawback is no armor.  Thats not a big issue really, but you probably arent getting a benefit from the armbands focus effect.  Just check.  getting better than +3  wis on arm might not be worth it in the bazaar right away, no rush, I used the armband quite a while myself.<br />
<br />
I really don't see any weak spots in your gear. Pretty solid stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">06-09-2005, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the case of a spell focus effect like Mana Preservation or Extended Enhancement, etc, the highest modifier will take precedence over any others.  MP3 will overwrite MP1, so no use keeping the MP1 item unless you like the stats.<br />
<br />
Also, just because you can melee a lot right now doesn't mean you should ignore your spell casting schools.  If you wait too long, raising your skills is gonna be a pain in the ass.  I remember trying to catch up in conjuring for my DoT's way back in the day, I just parked and summoned lightstones for an afternoon to raise my skill hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Storms</div><div class="date">06-11-2005, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I added a couple of new armor pieces and I'm sort of impressed.  Mana lvl is incredibly high compared to what my shaman had at this lvl!  I'm still looking at bazaar prices for more upgrades.........can't thank you guys enough for your advice.  :beerchug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wanderinglefty</div><div class="date">06-11-2005, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of ideas for future upgrades.<br />
<br />
The focus effect for Healing Conservation.  Hum is it called healing conservation?  I forget.  But if you are healing in groups thats a good one to get.  <br />
<br />
Extended range focus effect.  Thats a good one to get for many things.  Pulling.  Snareing.  Kites.  I've used it to spam heal someone getting beat on when the cleric couldnt heal them because to far away (got to watch that tho can't do it if a monk Fd'n as example)<br />
<br />
Theres an extended range level three armband that drops in karnors castle thing.  I believe its no drop so cant be bought have to get a friend or some help.  Course theres other ones out there also.  <br />
<br />
Wisdom is still the main thing, but you can swap out the extended range item when you need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Storms</div><div class="date">06-18-2005, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just dinged lvl 20 last nite and done some more upgrading. As I'm packing on the wisdom, I'm also trying to bring up some other of the stats as well. Most items have some wisdom already as I add more hp and straight mana.<br />
My question of the day now is:  what chest pieces are there? I keep a guy in trader mode alot and at least twice a day I do searches for upgrades, but it seems good chest pieces are difficult to find. Any suggestions guys? From my experiences with my other characters, &quot;good&quot; chest pieces last through alot of lvls and I figure that one item is something that I can afford to grow into.<br />
<br />
On another note, I'm finding that with the tons of mana I have (it seems tons to me anyway, more than my other chars had) at this lvl, I spend alot of time waitting for mana to build back up. I try to keep a DD spell of a couple of different magic skills up and use them through out the battles, so I can raise all the skill lvls I can. Getting a lizard seems to help a good bit though. I try to do the snare, root, dot style of fighting, but often times it's just as easy to let the mobs come on in and beat on me and let my damage sheilds help end the fights quicker. Is this a common type of fighting?  As my guild is sort of on a down slide with summer upon us, I spend all of my time soloing. I'm currently lvling in OT and the exp is actually not that bad, as long as I stay on the side of the zone closest to the PoK book.  With the damage I take in OT being so low, the forementioned style of fighting seems to work quite well.I attempted Marus Seru and although I didn't die and could probably have stayed there, it was more difficult. I'll probably head back there in another lvl or two.  In short, I'm just curious if there is some other style of fighting that I should be learning how to do.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice offered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wanderinglefty</div><div class="date">07-06-2005, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 20 using your damage shield is perfectly fine.  Snare root dot or aoe kiteing become more important later on.  <br />
<br />
Fear kiteing animals is another teqnique, not used that much but maybe useful in certain areas/times in your &quot;career&quot;<br />
<br />
Alot of players use charm but again not real popular till much later on, pon and the birds is where its first really used.  Animal Charm is another sometimes used teqnique, not a class defineing skill.</div></div><hr />

If you where to pay someone 5k to help you get a bp you would be doing good.<br />
