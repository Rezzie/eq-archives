IOW, once I get to 5 should I do more mauls and only do lacerates when the stack starts to drop?  Or does &quot;over stacking&quot; still give me lots of threat?<br />
<br />
I think that I should keep using Lacerate, but I'm not sure.  Frankly, I'm not sure why I never thought about this before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have enough AP &amp; crit swipe can become a VERY good threat generation move as well, surpassing the threat that lacerate does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FWIW, how much AP/Crit do I need before I can use swipe over lacerate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
SaysAs a rough estimate, if you have 2300-2500+ AP and ~30% crit chance, Swipe will prevail for single-target tanking.<br />
<br />
And there is this cool chart (http://ramblingbear.blogspot.com/2008/01/aclabt2-swipe-vs-lacerate-and.html) that gives you the amount of crit you must have at your current AP level in order to use swipe over lacerate.<br />
<br />
I'm no where close.  I think (though I don't often check these numbers while in bear), I have ~1500AP and 30% crit (fully raid buffed).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is only better to spam Swipe if the mob has some kind of modifier on it that increases Damage Taken by a great deal - for example, during The Curator's &quot;Evocation&quot; ability you should already have 5 stacks of Lacerate up, and it's better damage and aggro to spam Swipe instead of Lacerate for the duration of the Evocation.<br />
