Can anyone assist me in finding out more information about his change if there is any? <br />
<br />
FYI - I've experienced a dramatic increase in resists for ensnare vs. the giants in Plane of Fire.  Even the lvl 61 chromatic snare got resisted a few times more than normal imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been doing the (lazy and easy) murks in the cave in woS for so long and I am very used to it. The resists on snare there now are way up. <br />
<br />
Add to that the 'after-patch-fizzle-syndrome' also. <br />

Add to that the new spell fizzles.</div></div><hr />

I'm also recall seeing the &quot;spell recast time not met&quot; message quite often.  I don't ever recall seeing that message before the most recent patch.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't see it in a long time either, but the recast time not met message problem has been around for years... appears they did something that is causing more latency in the communications between server and client, which means you are slightly out of sync with the server and when your client timer expires, the server does not agree, thus the message. <br />
 <br />
What it also means is that spells are taking longer to cast actually, since the lag time causing the recast time error message is from when you click to when the server accepts the command and begins the spell cast timer. It would generally only take a fraction of a second for most of us to hit the button and see that message so the lag may be very small, but enough that when mashing the spell button as soon as it looks available(or before even ... repeatedly!) for an emergency heal you are that fraction of a second faster than the server will allow. The bigger problem is that you then lose even more time because the client sends the command to cast, through the connection lag, the server gets it and determines it was done at an invalid time and denies it, sends the denial message back and gives the error... and you thought you were casting that heal spell for the last second or so almost.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, it was introduced back in the Velious days I think, when they made huge changes to the client-server communication stream to improve security and attempt to thwart ShowEQ and the like.</div></div><hr />

I think we just found it.  There was one check that didn't get moved back from the new system to the old which would cause exactly what you're seeing.  It's fixed now and will go out when we patch.<br />

<br />
It's just the inventory slot you put in one of the hotkey's. So if I have my clickie root pants on I can use the hotkey to cast root. I do this for the epic 1.0 and orb from Time to cast the DoT's also.</div></div><hr />
