This quest is somewhat unknown, what is known is if you are a druid with unkempt druid faction you say to A Hermit in South Karana &quot; i want to join the unkempt druids&quot; he tells you to wait outside for Jale Phlintoes is about to arrive. Jale is a GM druid and spawns east of the hermits house then runs to the hermits door, stands there and despawns. I cant find any info on what you do or say to him. I know that in eq lore all unkempt druids carry Black Wood Chips, it resembles the tunare tree that sprung all woodland on norrath, this chip can be found on an npc in south qeynos you have to spawn by doing this quest http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=298. There also is a bard quest that involves the hermit and a few other npcs around karana: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=377<br />
 <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=399<br />
 <br />
ive looked up all npcs under unkempt druids and quests they give etc. There is a very small circle of npcs that run on the unkempt druids faction and this quest is one of the few things keeping me playing everquest. <br />
If anyone knows how this quest please post, or anyone itnerested in help solving it.<br />
 <br />
There si another unsolved quest involving the glowing black stone, pyzjn,varsoon,tovax vmar and the plaguebringers that i have also been working on but that isnt druid based its necro/sk or anyone starting on evil faction in qeynos really so ill keep that aside.</div></div><hr />

There is a quest for him, but, it is unsolved, probably not the one you are searching for. But, in the Surefall Glades, I can not remember offhand who, but, he is seeking Jale's head. As far as I know, Jale's head has never dropped, funny thing he may also be if they flagged him as unkillable do to him being a guildmaster, when they added that change. We eventually just got tired of killing him over and over with no head a few years ago, on multiple servers. I don't think anyone ever asked Jale, so and so is after your head, that could be a trigger phrase. <br />
<br />
There are just so many old broken quests, will little to no information to go on with alot of vanilla mobs, Cracktusk is one, well his &quot;little&quot; container with the combine button and so on. Lord Grimrot I am sure will be involved with the glowing black stone quest that has yet to be solved.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't neccessarily mean the glowing black stone will do anything with him, but, it could not hurt to check him out, or varsoon as well with charm. I would suggest a dire charm chanter, or necro for Grimrot, he is fairly resistant to magic based spells, if I remember right, plus plenty of time to poke around looking for quests with him besides Milea, Mistmoore castle, things like that. Preferably the chanter for alliance if that still works. <br />
<br />
There are just tons of named mobs that could be quest givers, in the karana's, qeynos areas, where simple phrases could open a quest line, or hand ins as well. That is fairly standard thoughout Faydwer and places like that as well, Lfay elf camp for one, tons of named elves, that do not speak, and have little to do with anything lorewise, except they have a name, and alot of busted and broken quests from all over.</div></div><hr />

And what about the UFO?  As I've been running around OGV I keep looking for it.  I keep wondering if the UFO is a response to the Bertoxx temple or if there is something else going on there that we haven't uncovered yet.  The other home cities are much more straight forward, but Qeynos... Qeynos has mysteries attached to it.</div></div><hr />

They acknowledged that it is for a quest in Stonebrunt Mountains.  I believe it to be related to the &quot;a spirit&quot; quest, being as how doing the grimy lance quest he spawns as Ridossan the Unliving, that is the key clue on that one, Varsoon is known as Varsoon the Undying. The  &quot;a spirit&quot; mentions something of another being similar to him that drew  more attention or something or other of that nature, of course with no prompt, probably the reason it was overlooked. Being as how I do not play anymore.... but, you will need heretic faction in paineel, enjoy laying waste in the warrens. Possibly an enchanter for charm/alliance.</div></div><hr />

Kinda like how later certain items became quest objects, or interlated in other quests, like Phylacetry, Velious quest chest for the robe/ tunic, ghoulbane, etc. I doubt they would have had another quest related to it prior to that, but, then, with the amount of busted quests in the game, combined with when they launched the quest tag on items when it was discovered it was for a quest.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">11-28-2009, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I goofed about with this a bit. But after killing the Hermit and even Jale once my faction with the Hermit is bad. I tried some factioning for the unkempt druids but it doesnt do anything for the Hermit. Now he just attacks me on site. I can't get a responce from a hail or the &quot;i want to join the unkempt druids anymore&quot;. He wont accept anything from me either. I don't see what faction the hermit is on either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;He&quot; being the Hermit? Or Jale? <br />
<br />
The Hermit doesnt have any faction hits when you kill him. I'm just not on good terms anymore and he will attack asap. If i try carefully i can sometimes get in the &quot;i want to join&quot; in before he attacks and the he says wait for Jale. <br />
<br />
If I do get that Jale message, Jale is still in attack mode so I cant talk to him or try to &quot;give&quot; him anything. I dont kill Jale anymore because I dont want to lower any faction more that i have in case i need to raise it. Although what i have tried to do to rais it didnt do squat. <br />
<br />
I looted several items while on the last spree so i wonder if having an item on me might make them angry.<br />
<br />
Seems like a lost cause but i'm still gonna try to find something to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">12-04-2009, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">will admit it has been awhile since I seen the hermit.  I think he was on the qrg protected animals faction, or he just had the rumored hidden faction.  Jale was unkempt.  <br />
<br />
The old harmony, wolf form, invis and sneak trick(if a halfer) should still work.  What you are seeing with the aggro from the hermit is the awareness, aggro range trick, same as the instant invis trick when invis drops next to kos mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-07-2009, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About to give up. I had several talks with GM's and you know how felpful they are. One made a copy of my character and maxed the Unkempt and QRG faction and said he could turn in stuff to the Hermit but couldn't do much else. Another said that they both were on both factions. If this is true I don't see a way to win because everything I see either questwise or killing wise will always raise one but lower the other. I was then told that I need just the Unkempt faction but after much killing I'm still kos. <br />
<br />
I still can get Jale to spawn with agroing the Hermit if I'm careful, his 2 wolf freinds are hard to avoid though. But Jale just doesn't like me. <br />
<br />
Cant harmony the wolfs, hermit and I doubt Jale. Wolf form doesn't seem to help either. <br />
<br />
The only option I see would be to keep killing to see if I can get Unkempt faction up any. But as slow as it is going up, IF it is going up, I doub't I will ever make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-13-2009, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update: <br />
I got unkempt faction up to dubious and the Hermit now talks to me and Jale doesn't attack me on site. But still to replys from Jale. I did some of the quests the Hermit offers. Salmekia's heart for the song, the song sheet from Cordelia after the flute after giving the Hermit Talym's head. <br />
<br />
I haven't found any other quest offers from the Hermit. I probably need to get Unkempt faction up for any chance to talk with Jale. Possibly QRC also. But the quests and kills for these factions are oppisite. Turning stuff into the Hermit raises both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">12-14-2009, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, I never could get Jale to respond to any prompts, like Gerael wants your head, nor would he even talk to me except trying to give him things he would return.  I tried turning in the black woodchip into him once, which should have flagged him as I killed an unkempt druid.  Kinda like Captain Tillin if you turned in a qeynos guard bracer, instead of a corrupt guard bracer.  Now that you mention it, I never tried to hand in Talym's head to Jale either, nor that chick, Sowlin, in West karana's heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-14-2009, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it odd that when you kill Salmikia for the heart you get a faction hit for the QRC protected animal but when you turn the heart in to the Hermit you get a faction plus. It's the same darn quest. <br />
<br />
Well after much killing I'm now amiably to Jale. <br />
<br />
And after much more killing I'm still amaiably to Jale. <br />
<br />
I might as well go for ally. Then possibly work on QRC. Although that will probably lower Unkempt so I'll have to work that again. <br />
<br />
Only quest that I don't think lowers QRC or Unkempt is Talym's head. But that's a long and iffy spawn cycle in Qeynos. I read about him in Freeport but after the revamp I never found him there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">12-14-2009, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">talym spawns in the caves also in surefall glade, also qeynos hills as well.  However, there is a better spot to kill him at.  Rathe Mountains, near the Paladin camp, the relocated Hill Giants camp, there is an inn.  Inside this inn is a spawn cycle about every 30 seconds or so random NPC's you typically find running around the qeynos hills cycle of NPC's like Edwin Motte, Talym is one of them.  No idea on the respawn cycle for that inn though, but, I watched the cycle for a bit.<br />
<br />
If you got some storm reaper faction to spare, in Nek forest there are a few halflings you can cap for +unkempt. Always hated the unkempt faction, trying to balance out the faction hits with Jaggedpine, Protectors of the Pine, Stormreapers, kithikor residents......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-16-2009, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went to Rathe Mtn to check it out. Is that something they set up for those who didn't want to wait for the other long quest spawns? To &quot;help reduce&quot; the pain of camping? I almost think it's worse, lol. Anyway, I didn't see Talym and decided I'd go kill in Kith again. <br />
<br />
I did try the halflings in Nek. I only found 1 of three camps from the map so most likely the others are history. Was easy kills though. Less running around. Might go back and check it out again. <br />

I believe I'm up to warmly&quot; btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">12-16-2009, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No idea why they did it like that in Rathe Mountains.  I thought it was bugged when I was up there and seen it, it wouldn't be the first time something like that happened.  But, other times I was up there they still kept spawning like that so....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-17-2009, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i made it to Ally - not maxed but I'm there. Nothing seems to have changed. <br />
<br />
I just got the heart from Talym and Salmekis. spoke the &quot;i want to join the unkempt druids&quot; to the Hermit. And when Jale showed up he was sporting a new weapon. <br />
<br />
http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y272/Vekx/Jale-new.jpg<br />
<br />
But nothing else changed and the next time he showed up he had the same old staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-20-2009, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'm running out of options. I'm ally with Jale but he doesn't ever respond. All I can do is train with him. I'm wondering if he just isn't there if you need a trainer and have bad faction with all the other trainers. But that really wouldn't make sense because why would you have bad faction unless you tried to become an unkempt druid? <br />
<br />
I followed the note that said Jale called for Gash's head and killed Gash many times but no head. And Jale wont take Talym's head. I followed Gash around and he does say a couple of things as we walks around but I couldn't get any responses to these. In a bar he will talk and some of the other NPC's in there seem to have a dialog but I couln't find any triggers to get more from them. <br />
<br />
There are several references from the NPC's to other NPC's but the faction differences between them wouldn't make sence to follow most of them. If I can't find a new lead for the Jale/Unkempt faction I don't think there is anything with Jale and no &quot;Unkempt Druids&quot; quest. Just a way to spawn a Druid Trainer.</div></div><hr />
