BUT after Foraging 30 times my skill still stays at 177. Is there a stat (ie-Wis;Dex) that will increase my skill-ups? Is it normal to move so slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araxx Darkroot</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope. Just keep hitting that forage button. There's a way to link it to the movement keys or another, but I dunno how to do it. It'll go up, it's all a matter of the luck in the roll you get when you hit it which determines a skill up or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no stat that increases it that I know.  What I've done with skills like that on alts is to make a key for a skill that you use a lot (like tracking) and use the /doability command for both forage and tracking on the same key.  Then every time you track, you forage if the ability is available.  I used to throw sense heading in there too, but from what I hear you don't need to do that any more.<br />
<br />
Since I quit I've heard there's a new command (/autoinv or something) that will automatically drop whatever you forage into your inventory.  Add that to your key as well :)</div></div><hr />

At 177, it's not unusual at all to go 30 attempts (or even 50-100) without a skill gain, so nothing is wrong.  Just keep trying.<br />
<br />
I suggest the following hotkey:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/doability X  (where X = your forage #)<br />
/pause 5 (you might need more than 5 on a slow system)<br />
/autoinventory<br />
<br />
Just press it every 2 minutes wherever you go and you'll get 200 forage in no time (along with a lifetime supply of water, rabbit meat, and roots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendan</div><div class="date">03-28-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also assign forage to a hotkey, go into the keyboard tab in options, and find the listing for the indivual hotkeys.  Make the alternate for the hotkey forage is assigned to the same as one of your movement keys.  Every time you move in that direction you'll forage if the button isn't greyed out.</div></div><hr />

Or if Im not in a group and I want to group buff them /(*^^ .   Is there any place that list these things</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">03-29-2004, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is possible to hot key an item in your inventory.  Just like dragging spell gems from your spell book except you're dragging inventory to the hot-key box instead (i.e. hold left-click on item until a copy pops out onto your cursor, place accordingly).  It's a handy trick, and it makes those fireworks sticks easier to spam =P</div></div><hr />

This is good and bad. Good because your skill goes up without you having to remember to hit a hotkey. Bad because there is always a flask of water or a root on your cursor.  You can set it up by going to your options window. Keyboard tab. Assign whatever button you want to the hotkey that has forage.</div></div><hr />
