In the Arena PvP when the expansion comes out (which is where the good rewards will be), all abilities with greater than 15 minute cooldowns are banned.  The only good thing is that all consummables were also banned, so we can at least still come as a major mana pot.<br />
<br />
If they end up indoors we are just done.</div></div><hr />

You'll have how many battles over the course of 30 min?  Paladins using lay on hands, warlocks using soulstones, shamans self rezzing, warriors using shield wall.  <br />
<br />
It's taking out the possibility of making a 2v2 game into a 3v2 ( counting rezing ).<br />
<br />
If they don't make it outside though, reducing our cat speed, travel form and only form of CC we have to offer, then yeah I'll be kind of upset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if they are going to block the portals deck trinket somehow I can't see yet.  As far as I can tell it will be the only way anyone will be able to rez in there.</div></div><hr />

I believe rebirth is the only druid ability affected by the cooldown rule.  Just pray it is outdoors so we can still root/travel form.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm... I think a dmg pala/shaman and a feral/moonkin would be a nice combo. Think that most classes but the mentioned would have trouble grind down the mana of the 2.<br />
With the xp from duelling as a druid against a pala/druid it can go on forever, a experince most dps classes dont have that want to finish the opponent off asap.<br />
<br />
People would choose druids cause we can heal and we dont have sheep form ;)</div></div><hr />
