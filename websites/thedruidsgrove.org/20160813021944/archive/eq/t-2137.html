<br />
My other question is concerning PBAoE.  I have heard of people faction hunting that will use our druid AoE to kill off large numbers of mobs at once, but everytime I try I get interrupted.  I eventurally have to run for my life or get killed because I cannot get off a single cast.  So how is our AoE possibly used while soloing lower lvl zones?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

The idea being,  you limit the number of hits you take,  limiting the chance you will have of being interupted....<br />
<br />
It works,  just takes some practice and room to run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sojuorn</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As another thought, do you still get faction hits for buffing others?  Like if there are some youngsters hunting in the zone and I tossed them some buffs would I get the faction for their kills as well?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sudawilde</div><div class="date">07-01-2003, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, here is how you do it if you have some friends that need faction also....<br />
<br />
the best method i have used is 3 or more people<br />
<br />
Person one pulls as many mobs as toonably possible and brings the swarm to the group.<br />
<br />
person two positions themselves in the middle of the mass as fast as possible and uses their biggest pbaoe.   Hopefully pulling all the agro off the puller.<br />
<br />
person three does exactly what person 2 did,  most mobs should be dying or very close to dead now(it really depends on the mobs you are pulling)<br />
<br />
repeat this cycle until all mobs are dead,  heals can gain you a ton of agro also if you need to heal the puller or anyone else,  just substitute in the heal for the  pbaoe in any one round.  The best method is to have the puller run right at person 2 stand on top of him.  if you can transfer agro fast enough there is usually no need to heal until after all the mobs are dead.   Just about any casting class can join in these little green pbaoe blood bath festivals.  At least anyone with any sort of AoE spell that generates moderate to large agro.<br />
<br />
Mass green mob slaying is fun,  and best shared with friends  :D</div></div><hr />

The game calculates interrupts by the distance you've moved from the beginning to the end of the spell cast.  Bashes (and stuns, etc) will also interrupt your spell, so have high AC and hopefully they will miss.<br />
<br />
I am too lazy to time anything so I just have best regen up, aggro tons of stuff, find a nice corner, run into it, then cast.  You will probably be interrupted, but eventually you will channel one out.  Spell haste helps too.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, you may have to wait a bit for all the casters to catch up to you.  They tend to lag behind.<br />
<br />
My personal record best was about 90 kobolds in the warrens. 20 or so goblins, I didn't do much AOE'ing there, I was fooling around when invis dropped =P.  Droga and Nurga are being revamped to level 60 zones (is that already live?) so there will be no more PBAOE'ing for faction in the future i'm afraid :(  <br />
<br />
Edit: oh yeah, why solo? get a bard friend.  They can play AOE slow and make absolutely monstrous trains.  When they are done gathering up, just go into the fray (nothing will attack you, they should be pissed at the bard) and cast catastrophe :)  Both of you will get the faction hits.  I've cleared out nearly every single mob in the warrens at once this way.  Bards can tank a bit better than druids too, better for taking the hits.<br />
<br />
Be warned, when the AOE hits, your computer may freeze for a bit :)</div></div><hr />

Am I killing the wrong things because I am not seeing any faction for the Sarnak Collective?<br />

Aluaeia:<br />

How many salts/skins did it take to get your faction up?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />
