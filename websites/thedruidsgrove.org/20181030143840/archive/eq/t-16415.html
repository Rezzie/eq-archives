<br />
So far I have seen Spell Damage, Heal Ability, and Clairvoyance.<br />
<br />
Obviously I know what they do, but in what way?<br />
<br />
Does Heal Ability heal me? help me heal other people? Is it a heal ability that goes above the regen cap?<br />
<br />
Does Clairvoyance mean mana regen above the cap? or something completely different.<br />
<br />
Spell Damage is so general I don't know were to begin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone have a site or a list of some kind that lets us know?</div></div><hr />

Clairvoyance has a chance to return mana to you after casting a spell (similar to mana pres)</div></div><hr />

Say an item has healing with 2 is that 2 % or 2 hp or something else or is it unsure at the moment ?<br />

Well if its like the other mods, then its % increase.</div></div><hr />

If you have 100 backstab mod, each backstab is given +100 dmg.<br />
<br />
I suspect the new mods are either a % or a straight addition.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
   To be honest i hope this is'nt the case. if we have &quot;heal ability +100&quot; how is an extra one hundred hp on heals gonna be of any help?  thats just a number, as i suspect the &quot;healing ability&quot; plus's will be hard to even get it that high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajolae</div><div class="date">11-24-2007, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">+Spell Damage and +Healing give different amounts for different spells, no one on beta was really able to pin down any rhyme or reason to it. For example, each point of +Healing was/still is I assume, provided Survival with ~+30hp healed, while for any other heal it was 1/10th that or lower. SotF was a true oddity for all of this since it has massive gains in comparison to other spells for +Spell Damage or +Healing. Neither of the mods can provide enough to send a spell over double its base healing/damage value, the first two SotF triggers will only double in the HP healed with ~130 +Healing, while the other three will get around 4000 extra HP healed which is less than double for all of them.<br />
<br />
Clairvoyance didn't even work on beta, and afaik, still doesn't on live as I've yet to see anyone provide any evidence that it is working.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The healing and damage mods add that much to every instant spell of the appropriate type (they are looking at how to do it with dots without it going crazy)<br />
<br />
Clairvoyance is a CHANCE to gain that much mana every time you cast any spell.<br />
<br />
None of these are capped. It is just controlled by the small numbers you currently see.<br />
<br />
The Damage Shield reduction reduces the damage you take when hitting an NPC with a damage shield by that much. This one is capped. (I am not at liberty to say what the cap is, that is up to others to say)<br />
<br />
All of these are cumulative.</div></div><hr />
