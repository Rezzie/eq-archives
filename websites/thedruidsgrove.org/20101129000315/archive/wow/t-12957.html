When TBC came out I knocked the dust off my druid because there was actually a need for feral druids.  We had some purpose and were actually expected to be able to do things other than heal.  I've been feral until last night.  I've maintained a pretty nice set of spellpower gear, just because I like to be well rounded.  Atm unspec'd I'm sitting at almost 1100 spellpower, 100 hit, and 150 haste.  There's not much for me to accomplish before wrath, I plan on spending the next week and a half pvping a lot as a boomkin.  Just looking for a little spec advise from you guys.  Here's what I'm looking at so far.  Still have a few points to spend and I'm not sure where to throw them.  I might run some heroics or something but for the most part I'll be pvping.  Thanks for any help.<br />

This is what im currently using and i doing quite well with it, i have been topping bg's and in the top three when i comes to 5 man heroics dps, usually outdone by a ret pally  but it seems to be a pretty good build imo i think master shape shifter for the added spell power is a must as boomkin<br />
<br />
this is what im aiming for at 80 <br />

I found this pretty funny.  There are only 3 dps in a heroic - tank, heal, dps, dps, dps - and you're in the top three?  heh.  <br />
 <br />
Other than that the spec looks good to me, though I've never really played boomy myself (thinking of trying it out this least week too though)</div></div><hr />

Balance Raiding (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xGbuiIsIdhVzRuZfx0d)<br />
<br />
I'm relying on mana reg in the resto-tree cause u WILL have issues in WotlK i think. Especially if u are using &quot;eclipse&quot; right.<br />
And wrath-spam is the mana-consumer nr.1.<br />
<br />
I would prefer for raiding the moonfire-starfire combo with the 2 glyphs, which increase moonfire-dot-damage by 75% and make starfire increase moonfires duration by 3 secs.<br />
I think its the most steady damage u can get out of the spells.<br />
<br />
Was thinking of getting genesis too, but then i would loose the fun-spells like Typhoon, Starfal, Treants and Gale Winds.</div></div><hr />
