The parts I liked from that interview however was the indictment on organized media outlets for ignoring issues such as financial aspects, while not mentioned to much, but, as a underlining theme, also something I have argued quite a bit, but, the media inability reporting towards abuses, misuses of power, legislation and other various activities detrimental towards the American people.</div></div><hr />

The guy has no constraints!  He doesn't have to worry that he's going to get shut-out of interviews if he asks questions that are too tough.  And he isn't afraid to interject his own personal opinion.  He knows he has the ratings and powerful following that people really WANT to be on his show and will risk some embarrassment.</div></div><hr />

Than Stewart must not watch CNBC much.<br />
<br />
Stewart wanted to cast CNBC as a bunch of out-of-touch Wall Street guys who don't care about 'main street' so he cherry-picked footage that showed that. There is such a wide range of views on CNBC and such a volume of footage that you could edit a bunch of videos together to show that CNBC believes just about anything.  I could make CNBC look socialist if I used the same methods as Stewart.<br />
<br />
However, I agree that the way Cramer is marketed in too much of a God-like way.  Cramer comes on in the evenings when the &quot;401-k/IRA&quot; crowd gets home from work, so Stewart has a fair point there.</div></div><hr />
