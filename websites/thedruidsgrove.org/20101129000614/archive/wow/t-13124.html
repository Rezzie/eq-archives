I'm a Balance spec and felt like doing some AE grinding. Not sure if it's really very effective but it's different for now. <br />
<br />
I find that at 70 if I pull 5 level 68 - 69 mobs I can AE them down with just Hurricane. Of course I'm getting a beat down while doing this. <br />
<br />
I've found in the Borean Tundra the Mammoths in groups of 5 are a good pull and so are the robot things in Farshire. <br />
<br />
Are there any other places to pull groups of melee mobs?</div></div><hr />

QH is nice but for me it makes me lazy and not even follow the story of the quest. Then I also do like 2 or more at once if I can which further dilutes the lore.<br />
<br />
I don't even know if EQ grinding is that much more effective than just nuking 1 and root/dot'ing another 1 at the same time. I haven't done any timing or anything yet.</div></div><hr />
