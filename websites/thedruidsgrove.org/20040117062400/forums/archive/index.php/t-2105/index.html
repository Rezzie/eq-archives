<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Desenso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been hunting at the DSP zoneline to Maiden's Eye for a couple of hours now and it seems to me that I could probably quad kite.  There is a semi-static spawn to the left as you zone in, mobs that wonder around but can always be found in the same place, and a lot of free space on the right - anyone tried snaring a few, pulling them over and quad kiting them?<br />
<br />
Let me know.. this is pretty good exp on my warrior, I get about 1% per kill more or less.  THey have a lot of hitpoints, but I'm not sure if my 51 druid would be able to take them down or not.<br />
<br />
I would try it but my 51 druid currently has no equipment so I can't really test it out too well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its very easy to test if you can quad kite something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply pull a single mob and use your quad kite spells. If you go oom then you wont be able to to 4 :) <br />
<br />
Also make sure you have aleast 1 extra nuke after this test incase you get any resists with your Quad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look a few posts down in  &lt;a href=&quot;http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovequests.showMessage?topicID=6358.topic&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread, it has a good guide to where and how to quad toilers in ME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chlorala Bructeri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have quadded gorangas by the DSP zoneline before at lvl 56-57 without any problem going OOM.  I also quadded the coterie to the south of the DSP zoneline.  That DID take me OOM and it took me so long to kill them that I had to re-Ensnare the mobs, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demina21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually set up in that Coterie castle just south of the DSP zone line.  I grab the three static Coterie and then a Bat to make it 4 and kill them.  Med up and then invis and run almost straight out and grab the 3 Goranga that are out there.  Usually get at least 1 add but no big deal, if a mob is snared it is owned.  Med again and then run out and pull Bats.  You can pull 8 bats and do them with one bar of mana (well depending on level and mana pool).  Med again and the Coterie should respawn by now.. rinse and repeat.  At 62 and going 50/50 on reg xp/aa xp i would average 3-5% reg exp and 7-10% aa, depending if there were any light blues involved.  Easy and fun and refines quadding skills.<br />
<br />
      The area to pull to is just west of the little castle, it's a nice long flat area.  Run between the big rock to the south and the tree on the other end.  It's perfect and no adds unless someone trains you coming form AR.<br />

<br />
I pull the goranga scouts 8 at a time to help my friends get the shard mob.  I can do a quad of 8 and then quad the other 6.   Finishing up the second quad, med a minute, go for respawns.<br />
<br />
If I can do the scouts 8 at a time, someone not as high level or well equipped can do the regular goranga's, toilers or anything in the zone that doesn't cast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TryonB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found that charming a ravenous beast was FAR better EXP in ME then quad kiting.  Not all rav beasts are charmable with Call of Karana, about one in 3 is low enough.  My best camp was the 3 coterie closest to the DSP zone.  2 buildings with one in each, then one pop in center.<br />
<br />
Grab a beast and lead him over to the zone wall.  Pull, root, send in pet.  Rav beasts are some of the toughest mobs in the zone, lucky for you.  Don't forget to Savage Spirit and DS your pet.  Also, if you hit with Glamour of Tunare, your charm will last longer. There's plenty of room to kite and re-root or charm if needed.  Once you clear the 3 coterie, there's a whole field of bats, toilers, and skellies in the area just beyond.  Literally endless pulling.  You don't even really need c3.</div></div><hr />
