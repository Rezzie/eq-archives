I just dinged 57, and realized i have no idea where to hunt for xp with all the new expansions and whatnot, or if there is any must have items I should grab.  Is there a viable quad kiting spot at 57?  Or charm spot?  Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

The new TSS expansions are chock full of great XP areas, but you might be undergeared some.  Goru'kar Mesa is for 45-55 and Blackfeather roost is for 55-65, probably some overlap in there.  I don't have a lot of experience in those zones though.  I did most of my leveling in old zones while the rest of the population was checking out new content.<br />
 <br />
Still do that, come to think of it.  Quieter and less competative.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If you don't have ceramic gavel of justice or something with that focus effect I would get that.<br />
 <br />
If you post your magelo I might be able to help you some more. Also I hung out some in valor but it was with wizzy and shaman. (I remember dinging 60 there).<br />
 <br />
I too did most my leveling in old worlds pre-65.....even though I re-started last April.<br />

I've gotten to 59 in a couple days by a combination of quad kiting and reverse charm killing right at the entrance.  <br />
 <br />
As far as gear goes, I have most of my focus effects, but i'm having trouble with a few, namely Improved healing and burning affliction.  I'm still wearing a coldain military wristguard even though the stats make me wanna cry because is has BA 3.  Any suggestions there?  I play on firiona vie, so it could even be a usually no drop item.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Buff yourself up (including SOE). Then mem three spell sets. First set being quick heal, CHeal, charm, ensnare, animal debuff, skin, strength, evac. Second set replacing animal debuff, skin and strength by pet haste, DS and regen. Third replacing the three slots again by animal debuff, root and a dot.<br />
 <br />
Ensnare, debuff then charm a pet, give it magi summoned pet armor and weapons, buff it with skin and strength. Change to set two, buff it with DS shield, regen, and haste. Change to set three, sic it on mobs. Toss one dot on the mob to get your share of the exp. Root the mob if necessary.<br />
 <br />
Buy a cheap drog (or use the mechanical boar coming with one of the expansion packages), sit on it, and CHeal your pet. An extended range focus is a must -- you want to be far away from your pet in case charm breaks.<br />
 <br />
Order your pet to guard a place instead of following you. This way when it kills the mob it does not come back to you, but goes back to the place. Also a hotkey to unmount may not work while you are casting CHeal: you need to manually click on the mount icon in the spell window to get rid of the horse/drogmor and run for your life.<br />
 <br />
I did it at zone in area of Mischief and was pretty successful. Other popular ideas include charming a raven in POnightmire to kill the werewolves, or charming a rat in POdisease for other mobs. But I like Mischief the most since the ground is flat and no roaming ones. Not all skunks in Mischief are charmable though, some are too high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">04-06-2007, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Charming is something you should experience but the exp was never all that good for me.  Also, I believe you'll want to at least cast flame lick on your target because your pet will eat half your experience if you don't do at least one point of damage yourself on the mob (this may have changed, been at least 4 years since I've done it).<br />

Anyhow, kiting in OC gives druids the coordination they need and lessons learned to be successful kiters later on.  That's the way it was for me and most the druids I know.  I learned a LOT of things I was doing wrong in this zone from healing on the EW, WW and IC (the elitists hang-out =P) and rabbiting in the OC.<br />
 <br />
/ooc IC quit stealing our mobs gd it!!</div></div><hr />

For those who don't speak Uber, EW and WW are Eastern and Western Wastes. When I was a mid level Druid, it always drove me nuts to have to figure out what language people are talking when they posted initials for every spell, zone and ability they have. :banghead:<br />
 <br />
Still trying to figure out what IC and OC are... must not have kited there... guess I'm not a Druid.</div></div><hr />

Did some kiting (mainly root rotting in Cobalt Scar). After 51 I was always with my now perma group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">04-06-2007, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No no. OC, IC, EW, WW are all camp names in POValor. <br />
 <br />
Maybe, just mabe: OC=outer cave, IC=inner cave, EW=east wall, WW=west wall.<br />

And we just say Inner and Outer for the caves. So if someone calls a camp check - you will see LCY, RCY, Inner and Outer. LOL funny how each server has its own names for stuff.</div></div><hr />
