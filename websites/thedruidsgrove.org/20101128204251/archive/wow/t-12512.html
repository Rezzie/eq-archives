<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djellum</div><div class="date">04-05-2008, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So ima boomy and still do lots of healing for the guild, but ive had this feral set of scrub gear for a while and and wanting to polish it up and get it ready to do something with.  I dont plan on respecing but wondering what use i can put the gear to.<br />
<br />
When quest gear is blah, or something drops in an instance/Kara that nobody wants i pick it up.  I only have the one set, other than having a couple peices for a few slots (like both Braxis and the dreamers staff), and want to make an all around set to play around with or maybe tank a lower instance for a guildy or something.<br />
<br />
what stats offer the most bang?  415 def for tanking raid bosses, but i dont plan to do that.  how much is needed just to tank a 5 man, or perhaps off tank something until a real tank can get to it?  My first thought was to just go agil/stam on everything and see where it comes out but since im missing all the feral ability related talents like predatory strikes and HotW is it better to go for AP/stam?<br />
<br />
any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

It's not like being &quot;kinda&quot; dps.  You have to have the gear to tank it.  Regular instances fine, heroic and up you need real tank gear.<br />
<br />
Go for the leather crafted crap if you want a good starter set.  get your defence maxed for being uncritable or you will die...alot.  Get at least 20% dodge, and 12k+hp or dont bother with heroics.  Yes you can save it just going bear and having a good healer, but that's the healer not you.  Any spec takes a good gear set.  Your spec means you need even more gear, not less to tank.</div></div><hr />
