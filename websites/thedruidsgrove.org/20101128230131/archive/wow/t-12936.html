<br />
We had diseased people running around infecting other players and NPC's and then turning into zombies. <br />
<br />
Just wondering if this was happening everywhere?</div></div><hr />

SSO questgivers, vendors, and even the FP guy were all dead... the wyvrens were all flying around in a tight circle. if you clicked on one it said &quot;angry wyvren&quot;<br />
<br />
pretty hilarious...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The angry wyverns actually froze / crashed wow the first time i saw them.  I came racing up to them on my mount, and the amount of stuff going on was apparently too much for my video card.<br />
 <br />
Cool event.  Not sure what its for, but cool none the less.</div></div><hr />

I don't really follow the lore so much, so I can't tell you with certainty.<br />
<br />
Evidently you can start a new plague with the [Conspicuous Crates] in Booty Bay... Depending on whether I'm doin arena tonight, I may have to kill a couple hours infecting some alli areas tonight :P</div></div><hr />

 <br />
How are arenas on your server?  They've been incredibly laggy for me.  And all the Rets make me :banghead:</div></div><hr />

I have mixed feelings about it... My team mate has been raiding lately when I've been on, so we haven't gotten a good chance to talk about strategy or new abilities yet.<br />
<br />
World PvP is making arena look promising though. I'm looking forward to clawing a hunter's face off :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
If discover one more missing (or dead) battlemaster or daily quest giver, I think I'll cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-27-2008, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I thought the concept was good.  The implementation sucked.  it basically gave all of the power to any idiot who felt like griefing their own people.  I watched a level 70 hunter infected and naked run into the mage quarter in IF, run right up to the pally trainer and then become a zombie on purpose.  <br />
<br />
Note that every single mage trainer was already dead by this point.  Talk about a complete PITA.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much the worst event so far from my opinion.  Hopefully the zombies are gone soon.</div></div><hr />

It was a great world event IMO.  I'm not sure we've had anything like it before.  It was nice that everyone was affected.  Normally world events are lame things (like holidays) that you just ignore.<br />
<br />
It only lasted 1-2 days and was during a time in which nothing else was really going on in the world as every one waits for LK.<br />
<br />
Perfect timing, perfect event, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-28-2008, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its the most stoopid thing Blizz have ever done imho.<br />
<br />
u waste time waiting around for a trainer or quest giver or FP to come back after some idiot has killed them.<br />
<br />
i guess the opening of the AQ gates was a good World Event.<br />
<br />
this one is Fail of Gargantuan proportions and shows Blizz up to have a major lack of understanding of how people play the gane.<br />
<br />
in my limited time i dont want to die 3 times whilst trying to do some AH work, nor do i want to sit around for 10 mins whilst a quest giver of FP comes back to life /sigh</div></div><hr />

But, then, I went to TB to do my banking and PvP stuff since no one goes to that city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-28-2008, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well it was annoying in Shatty to not find the FP person or the daily quest givers there (sunfury plans / bem one for mana things) as well as the BG nps were dead every few mins it seemed !!<br />
<br />
when u have limited time/opportunities to play it became frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">10-28-2008, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the scourge invasion pretty funny.<br />
Sometimes it was annoying when all Shatt-NPCs where dead but its still an event i wont forget that fast.<br />
And it was also a good opportunity for a friend of mine who collects cooking recipes from the horde side.<br />
He said he got undead, traveled to ogrimmar and bought some stuff ;-)<br />
(dont know if true, anyone tried that?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">10-28-2008, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">um... im calling BS on your friend... he turned into a different kind of undead... Scourge =\= Forsaken... he would have showed up as red in Org and i don't think the NPC's speak Zombie</div></div><hr />
