While it didn't have a huge impact on my playstyle, it's a very cool tidbit of info to know, and surprisingly visible once you know what your looking for!</div></div><hr />

I learned its value long ago. But it DID affect my guild's assessment of the value of druid debuffs. And I am grateful for all the work Fen and everyone did in this area. Now if we could only get a similar debuff for ice!</div></div><hr />

Is that right or is it some kind of skill or spell you can get that helps in fights?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I also think my Guild Leader would agree that one Druid debuffing Attack and AC makes a huge difference in a raid.  (We are a small family guild that falls under the Casual Progression category, fielding 12-24 people for raids.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treesong</div><div class="date">08-09-2007, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It affected me too. In fact, I am building my new 6-box combo around it. As in, lots of DPS, no Slower, just Druid slow. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">08-10-2007, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always used debuffs in groups and also make sure we use them in raids too. If mob isn't resistant to ice or fire, epic chain wont start until I've seen HoR, Icefall, Sunray and Hoar land. <br />
 <br />
But good stuff still! I know many druids who do not use the debuffs because they have no idea what they do or they say &quot;oh I don't raid&quot;. Some don't even bother getting the spells :eek:</div></div><hr />
