<br />
I'm at a point of confusion, and I hope you guys can give me some help prioritizing my AAs.  I have about 390 now, so the obvious ones are done (healing and so forth).  (My Magelo is--I think--440339, but it seems to be down right now, so I can't link it).<br />
<br />
Pre OoW expansions, I have Lightning Reflexes, SotW, Radiant Cure, Innate Camo, Exodus, and other basic ones done.<br />
<br />
Within the OoW, I have the first level of chaotic potential, first level of buff slot, extra spell slot, healing AA done, first level of extra mana regen, and 2 levels of crit nuking AA.<br />
<br />
On raids I mostly heal with some damage.  I don't solo these days, and do healing/dps roles pretty evenly (my guild is in time).  I tend not to DoT much.<br />
<br />
My equipment will give me more stamina and other stats if I get the chaotic potential one, and also more mana regen if I get that AA.<br />
<br />
So, here's my thinking, but I could use help thinking through priorities:<br />
<br />
1)  Finish OoW crit nuke.<br />
2)  1 chaotic potential<br />
3)  1 mana regen<br />
4)  1 buff slot<br />
5)  final two levels of faster succor<br />
6)  additional sotw<br />
7)  defensive: OoW avoidance<br />
8)  additional sotw, finish up<br />
9)  OoW radiant cure<br />
10) faster reset on radiant cure<br />
<br />
Which are likely to give the most bang for my buck?  Am I missing something obvious?<br />
<br />
Thanks, all!</div></div><hr />

Looks like you are in a Time/Txevu guild? I don't play my Druid at that level yet but it seems to me you might want the more raid-oriented AA if you are missing some (like ones that hit your cures, more mana regen, and bigger SotW).<br />
<br />
I don't know much about raiding Druids yet, so take my recommendation with a big grain of salt. I'm sure the big guns will have better imput.</div></div><hr />

From your magelo it would seem your farming time regluarly. The next step for most guilds is Ikkinz, assuming your following a more common raid progression.<br />
 <br />
Spirit of the Grove is very useful healing wise when maxed. Depending on targets and how you handle those targets will determine how often you use it as a AE Heal however.<br />
 <br />
I am a huge fan of defenisve AA. If you are moving into upper content avoiding a single attack could save you 1500+ Hitpoints. It is very possiable you will still die, however the extra levels help in people patching you/letting a tank take aggro.<br />
 <br />
Since you claim to do healing and dps, I would probly finish out DF3 first - just to have it finished, then move onto SoTG/RM. <br />
 <br />
Extra Buff slots may or may not be a huge issue for you, depending on which buffs you have, and how many clicky buffs you tend to use.<br />

If you are finding difficulties with buff slots, get more of them.  Eventually you will want to get all of them, especially when you get to the fights where you need all the resist buffs and Alendar.<br />
 <br />
I find that for many AA that have multiple levels, I find it better to get all the levels of it then move on to the next one.  Of course, there are times you want to get another FT, or stat boost and get just 1 level at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
chaotic potential (only if you have the sta gear to get the hps)<br />
<br />
more buff slots<br />
<br />
resplendent cure 3 (the more your guild progresses, the more you will need this)<br />
<br />
quickened curing 3 is useful, and will shave 54 seconds off the reset timer. <br />
 <br />
SotW3 is fine, you really don't need higher levels until you pick up other AAs. <br />
<br />
Get the defensive AAs that follow lightning reflexes.  <br />
<br />
Finally, I would pick up crits near the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Negian</div><div class="date">08-10-2005, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest buying the resists aa's if you don't already have them. It makes a big difference and resisting AE's means you can concentrate on healing others and not yourself. Just my 2cp. Resisting AE's is awesome!  :)</div></div><hr />
