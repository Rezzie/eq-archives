<br />
here are my experiences so far and what info i have managed to get : there are 4 camps and 4 different factions of task givers in the hills of shade : <br />
<br />
Camp Valor : seems everyone is started auto-dub faction and non kos, i was able to get the tasks no prob and they are on a faction called camp valor ; we can raise faction by killing certain mobs and by doing camp valor tasks. this camp is located by going NW of the loping plains zone in and is in the NW corner of the land based portion of the zone<br />
<br />
Camp Bertoxx : again i was'nt kos and was at dubious so i can assume we all start that way. the faction is somthing like followers of bertoxxoulous and we can raise faction by doing their tasks and killing certain mobs. this camp is located by heading NE of the zone in from the loping plains.<br />
<br />
Camp kirathas : everyone starts KoS but a mask can be bought from the mysterious merchant found at loc 459.52 939.95, wich sets your faction to warmly. the kirathas camp seemed safe with the mask being worn. camp is in the SW corner of the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Camp full of buccaneers : in the NE corner of the zone ,again KoS but the same merchant sells another mask which sets faction to warmly so u can go get these tasks. this camp seems to have pre-set spots where the mask will crumble and u will immediately get attacked so be careful.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first 2 camps have smaller based tasks that are similar to the small parts of the hand aug.<br />
<br />
the kirathas camp has an aug that fits in a charm slot and gives 15 ac, 90 hp/mana and 15 to all saves, and i can assume the bandit camp has a similar themed aug but i havent looked yet.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Camps 3 and 4 might be un-related to camps 1 and 2 as the mysterious merchant sells a rose with an unknown function, and told me once i had finished with the buccaneer tasks and the kirathas tasks to come see him. (maybe he will combine them?) maybe camps 3 and 4 combine into a single aug and 1 and 2 into a single aug.<br />
<br />
 <br />
im hoping others will post with more info so we can see where this leads.</div></div><hr />

First you have to kill the 4 wereorc gravediggers. After that you have to kill the wereorc packleader. Thing is, the packleader is non-aggro. You can't cast on him and can't attack him. The whole bunch spawns every 20 mins but despawn quickly if not aggroed. Does anyone have any insight into this task? We killed the gravediggers after they came out of the graveyard so perhaps catching them before they go in would change things. <br />
 <br />
Also interesting to note is that once the gravediggers turn to run the poof. No exp and no task credit. At least for now be prepared to nuke them into oblivion from 10% or risk not getting the task update.</div></div><hr />
