On the subject of DoT Crits, I seem to remember actually getting a crit message for them, but I have not really seen any crit messages other than DD Crits since I've returned.  This made me think that my DoT Crits were broken until I went all squinty eyed one evening trying to read each DoT dmg message as it went flying by and noticed the occaisional high damage number.<br />
 <br />
That being said, other than making my eyes bleed, is there a filter option or some other feature to use to make DoT Crits easier to see?  It's really a vanity question because I like seeing the high damage numbers! :tongue: <br />
 <br />
Also, has the dev team given us a reasonable explanation of why we don't see specific DoT Crit text the same as we get with DD Crits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that would be a lot of extra spam if they had 2 or 3 additional lines of text for each time a dot tick critted.  Since a nuke can only crit once, it is not too much more information to display to show the critical.  For a dot, even one as short as NBW, you can get 2 crit ticks.  Compound that some people use multiple dots at a time and you quickly can get a lot of spam.<br />
 <br />
There may also be a problem in the way it produces that information similar to why it is difficult to parse someone elses dots.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I seem to remember them but then again, my memory resembles swiss cheese anymore.<br />
 <br />
I still think it would be nice to see them as long as they're a filterable option.  That is, able to turn the spam on or off or redirect it to another window.<br />
 <br />
Along the filter lines.... I've found how to abbreviate melee hits, am I just overlooking the filter that abbreviates DoT and spell damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">07-24-2007, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked for a way to abbreviate DoT messages years ago....  but sadly there isnt. I think it's unfair that you can do it for melee but not DoT's <br />
<br />
As for DoT crits. If you know how much a DoT lands for, more or less, you can see when it crits, more or less, by the number.</div></div><hr />
