The cast time of 5 seconds owns (3.75 with my focus)  Is it resisted a lot, does it last long enough to be used for soloing or does it seem to be random?  Not sure if anyone posted about this before but I'm too lazy to look.</div></div><hr />

Nature's Beckon: mana 800, cast time 5, recast time 12, resist: magic, charm up to level 65, charm duration: 7.5 minutes<br />
<br />
Command of Tunare: mana 420, cast time 8, recast time 24, resist: magic, charm up to 60, fizzle adjustment 5, charm duration: 20.5 minutes<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
There is no change in the resists, but level 65 animals probably have higher MR than level 60's. The good thing is the recast time is half what Command is, and has a lower fizzle rate, so you can recast it faster (17 vs 30) on resists/fizzles/wear-offs. Of course, to make up for that, the charm duration has been lowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to keep an eye out for the charm buff duration in pet window and sit the pet away from you for re-charm. I generally like to stay far away from mobs in Vxed, pets or not :)<br />
<br />
As for the spell itself, 800 mana is a decent amount, eneough that you can't go on indefinately.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">06-29-2005, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not fixed duration, in pop it's a nice replacement over the old charm b/c of the cast time and lower recast imo even though it takes more mana.   Not very usefull anywhere else.   <br />
 <br />
The idea of charming in vxed made me happy but when I got there found out that most mobs are immune based on their lvl appearently.   Was frustrating to test it on so many and get immune msgs (&gt;.&lt;)</div></div><hr />

Have beaten tipt many times with a druid charmed pet.  GoD zones the mobs charmed with this spell seem to give out full damage however if you charm chimera's in WoS the damage is nerfed.</div></div><hr />

I just went to alla's and found out that there is life beyond Blessing of Steeloak Skin. For some reason I thought that BoSS was the last glowing. Oh well, learn something new everyday I guess.
