it's broken btw... on a tank he said he didn't notice any heals, on me it made mobs in undershore hit for 30k.<br />

Meant to post that last night, now it looks like this morning's patch changed it.   But yeah, having an undershore mob smacking you for 30k was pretty messed... crushing a moss snake for 12k or almost one rounding an anguish geared war in a duel was pretty damn funny though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried with Druid, Mage, Cleric (1st mission went well so we figured we'd continue).<br />
<br />
Boss mob hit for 2400, and flurries.  It was only level 70 and was snarable tho.  Pretty much one rounded the Mage pet (which could tank the arachnids with one heal per fight).  I guess Tank and Slower are required for the second mission.  Unless I'm missing something regarding the script and it got messed...  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
The trigger phrases for him were &quot;hunk of rust&quot; &quot;disappeared&quot; and &quot;recover&quot; I think but not sure if they'd work with out first turning in an item to the broken spider beside him.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The item should be Cicero's Torn Notebook, not sure on where to find that one but heard it's from the chambers of Xill.<br />
<br />
So far the only instances I've found that lead into that zone are the Shrya raid and the 68 spell tasks from Kelliad so I'm guessing anyone that's gotten it was from the latter.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Confirmation on what mob where drops it or if this is for sure the task for the 69th spell would be really cool.</div></div><hr />

A guildie of mine invited me to the mission.  We did the hard version, all mobs were level 73 with a couple level 72.  Nothing summoned.  Drops were random from the mobs.  No respawn.  That's all I can recall as it was a while ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
turn it into Model XG CVIII and you can then talk with Brovil<br />
<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:22:40 2005] Model XG CVIII  says 'I-dent-if-ied, Cic-er-o's Note-book.  Error.  Con-tents missing.  Sections one through nine un-accounted for.  Current location of sections one through nine e-quals. . . unknown.  Ciero's current location equals. . . unknown.  Error.  Initializing shut down.  Click.  Whirrr.  Clunk.'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:22:42 2005] Brovil Pallivineg says 'You got Cicero's old clockwork talking again!  How'd you do that?  That [hunk of rust] hasn't moved or made a sound in over a hundred years.'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:23:08 2005] You say, 'Hail, Brovil Pallivineg'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:23:18 2005] You say, 'hunk of rust'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:23:18 2005] Brovil Pallivineg says 'That there is Cicero's clockwork assistant.  He took it everywhere with him when he was researching around here.  It hasn't worked since the day Cicero [disappeared].'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:24:09 2005] You say, 'disappeared'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:24:09 2005] Brovil Pallivineg says 'Unfortunately, last we saw of Cicero was over two hundred years ago.  He ventured off over the waterfall to the south in pursuit of some spelunking sporali migration or some such nonsense.  He never came back, although we did find Cicero's clockwork assistant with its cogs and springs tossed about near the lake of Korlach.  It was mostly bound up in a thick web and hasn't really worked ever since.  We believe Cicero was killed by the drachnids a long time ago, but we've been unable to organize a search party to verify anything.  If you can [recover] Cicero's notebook pages, we would reward you as best we can.  I'd hate to see Cicero's last great work disappear in this darkness.'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:25:41 2005] You say, 'recover'<br />
[Sun Sep 18 15:25:42 2005] Brovil Pallivineg says 'Many thanks Aelfin. It will be most welcome to finally know more about poor Cicero's end. See if you can find any trace of Cicero's pages in the drachnid hive.  Take any that you find and place them back in his notebook here.  If you lose the notebook let me know and I'll see if I can come up with [another] copy for you.'</div></div><hr />

then i got my spell, the crappy &quot;Spore Spiral&quot; lvl 68 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wodun</div><div class="date">09-20-2005, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lvl 69. lvl 68 is retile.<br />
<br />
and i like the new root :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">10-03-2005, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is some info on how to get the spells:<br />
<br />
For the 68 spell (Reptile Skin) talk to Kelliad in Stoneroot Falls and do the following missions:<br />
<br />
A Rogue's Trust, Scouting the City, Building the Disguise, The Search for Illsuras, The Rage of Kelliad<br />
<br />
For the 69 spell (Spore Spiral) talk to Brovil Pallivineg in Corathus Creep and do the following missions:<br />
<br />
The Lost Notebook, Cavern Botany, The Search for Clues, Rescue Cicero! <br />
<br />
(I strongly suggest that you have at least one enchanter for Rescue Cicero! since you have to escort and keep alive a stupid NPC who loves to run into groups of mobs.  Mezzing him, killing the mobs ahead of him and then mem wiping him is the way to go)<br />
<br />
For the 70 spell (Dawnstrike) talk to Jarzarrad the Prophet in The Undershore and do the following missions:<br />
 <br />
Preemptive Strike, Praetorian Guard, The Fall of Illsalin, Flight of the Seeker, Into the Shadows<br />
<br />
After doing each set, go visit Brother Hidden Path in The Undershore and hail him.  He will then give you your spell.<br />
<br />
Although most of the time the quest giver will only offer you the next mission in line, you can do them in any order if someone else gets it or you are offered more than one.<br />
<br />
Some missions have two of the same name with one of them having &quot;(hard)&quot; after the name, that means the mission is harder and (I assume) offers greater experience and item reward.  You do not have to do the hard missions, you can just do the normal one for the spell.<br />
<br />
Any further questions, ask here and someone is likely to know the answer. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't done any parts of the spell arcs yet.  Once you do one, can you do the same one again?  If I do the 68.1 can I do it again?<br />
<br />
Also, any other parts of the spell arcs soloable by druids?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Thats what I meant (see below).  You have to have completed all of the ones in the order to reach that mission to be able to request it.</div></div><hr />
