It can be things gotten off monsters, found in chests, lockboxes, or fished..  but it can't be quest rewards, things you bought off the AH, etc.<br />
<br />
I've found a total of only 2 blues on random world drops and I'm almost lvl 60</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess i'll have to change my 5 to none.<br />
<br />
I have never come across a drop from a random mob that has been blue.<br />
<br />
I would choose 9+ for green items though. tarnasis, stv to name 2.</div></div><hr />

Some have since been replaced by looted green gear that is better than the older blue. Still only 35 so long way to go yet.<br />
I had a blue Skeletal club drop in Raven Hill Cemetery last week. Random chance of some shadow damage. Sold it for 12g on AH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWK</div><div class="date">06-12-2006, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was onced asked:<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what class gets the most drops?&quot;<br />
<br />
=and=<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know why?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
His answer?<br />
<br />
Hunters get the most Drops<br />
<br />
His reasoning:<br />
<br />
Hunters have to be &quot;farmers&quot; by nature.  They have pets that require food, when they get a new pet they have to level that pet up and often on lower mobs.<br />
<br />
My buddy on his hunter, never bothered buying a mount...not that he didn't have the money but he felt that if he had a mount he'd ride right by the next epic.  He had all 16 slot bags and the minute he landed at the flight path he set out and killed everything in his path.  If there was something that yielded xp, could be skinned, or had a potential of dropping anything...he killed it, looted it, and skinned it.<br />
<br />
So, i took him to heart.  On every toon since my main, I employed that theory.  Kill anything that moved, yielded xp, and had a loot table.  I have to say, in comparison to my fellow guildies I always seem to get more blue drops...and i've had my fair share of epic BoE drops too.<br />
<br />
Additionally, when on a quest...I don't just run to the quest area get the quest item and then run back.  I kill everything on the way to the quest area, kill everything in the quest area and continue to do so until my bags are full.  I then turn around and kill everything on my way back home.  On my last two toons, I never bothered to even buy a mount until my 50s.  Not because I didn't have the money, but because I just wouldn't use it and the mount took a bag slot....LoL<br />
<br />
Just try it the next time you go out.  Land at the flight path and just kill anything that moves....never mount up....just kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**On A Side Note**<br />
<br />
My buddy's final argument was:  &quot;have you ever noticed the class the gold farmers pick?   And why do you think they always have blues up for sale?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pretty compeling argument right there   =)</div></div><hr />
