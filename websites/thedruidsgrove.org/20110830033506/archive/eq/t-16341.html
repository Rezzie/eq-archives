Is it possible for a level 72 druid to solo the drakes there? I think it's all in the technique to pull the drakes, I want to avoid the agro that will result in a death touch. <br />
 <br />
All the old posts talk about the bad pathing up there.<br />
 <br />
Any pulling advice would be appreciated. <br />

Thanks,<br />

You need to avoid the Sphinxs and adds were a typical problem due to the bad pathing.<br />
<br />
You can not get there on your own due to the 3 Dting mobs in the way you need to kill for keys.<br />

Although removing the no-rent tag from keys was a bonus, these keys finding a home on my keyring would be outstanding.  Devoting an entire bank bag to Sky keys is annoying.  Bleh.</div></div><hr />
