So far only the general tab ones are ready, hoping to do more tomorrow and will post as I get them mostly correct.<br />

I think I'm off 3 points somewhere but have been looking at it so long now I'm clearly not going to find anything. If anyone can spot it (or any other mistakes) I'd be appreciative. <br />
<br />
I can't seem to spot how to attach a file to this post but if you PM me your email address I'm happy to send you either Excel or PDF.<br />
<br />
Please leave feedback/corrections here ... thanks!</div></div><hr />

&lt;center&gt;CLICK &gt;&gt;&gt;Druid AA List as a Google Spreadsheet (http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pZp0aBtgciSrNwL7o-mTlBw)&lt;&lt;&lt; CLICK&lt;/center&gt;<br />
<br />
I've based the spreadsheet fully on Danaere of Fennin Ro (http://eq.magelo.com/profile/1373455)'s (Danae on TDG boards) Google Spreadsheet (http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pYaRK9aFuwxniVCzIc90wdA), which had all the General AA's as well as the layout of the spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
Nilwean One of Luclin (http://eq.magelo.com/profile/12155) have done all the AA cost and rankings of Archetype and Class tabs.<br />
<br />
Descriptions have been copy/pasted from &quot;dbstr_us.txt&quot; (a file in the EverQuest directory)..<br />
<br />
Here's The Original Druid AA List as Google Spreadsheet (http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p5vEyHhxSPmLkONnK5m1FRQ) for reference.</div></div><hr />
