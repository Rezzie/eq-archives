The hard part is, you have to kill the Twin Emperors and clear the annoying ass trash to C'thun in order to get the quest for the hand in. Basically... it's hard. :|</div></div><hr />

Rewords are exelent just I heard you need about 6 guild x40 guys to enter the instance and from inside , like usual 40 man . Is it true ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">10-09-2006, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AQ40 is the second hardest 40-man raid instance in the game (only Naxxramas is harder). You need to get past 5 bosses to get to the quest giver, be lucky enough for the regalia quest item to drop (and have enough dkp to get it), and get 3 elementium ore from Blackwing Lair (another 40-man instance).<br />
<br />
You'll probably never have a chance of getting this quest done unless you join a guild that does regular 40-man raids.</div></div><hr />

It's obviously not as good, but hey, you get 3 items by the time you get the full rep. You just have to do alot of AQ20. :)</div></div><hr />

If your definition of success in WoW is to have the best gear there is to offer, then you have to have a huge amount of time at your disposal.  Is this how you want to invest your precious time.  If not, you have to settle for lesser gear.  At 60+ with the upcoming content, I'm really starting to wonder if there is a game for anyone less than a  hardcore (all the time in the world) gamer.</div></div><hr />

One of the best posts I've ever seen . I really agree with this and I m a bit sad cause of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">10-10-2006, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure how you fix that though.  I mean if there weren't really elaborate and difficult quest lines to get some of the best stuff, it wouldn't be as special when you finally got it.  Ultimately there should be some extra benefits for the hardcore.<br />
<br />
If you think in terms not of the best in game, but the best available to me, you will be able to set yourself some reasonable gear goals and work towards them.  You're never going to get a legendary weapon, but you can make yourself competitive and have fun.</div></div><hr />

I think it means more that guilds will have a core group of raiders that they split into 2 groups ( with possibly different raid scheudles ) which eventually gears the guild up quicker.</div></div><hr />

Raiding takes a lot of time, coordination, gold (for repairs, pots, etc).  It takes 40 people, not 1.  The rewards should be better.  Look at the GM PvP gear.  Its very very good.  Its attainable.  Yet, it takes time.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people just want free epics.  I'm glad the game wasn't designed that way, otherwise, whats the point of playing?  There should be challenges involved in obtaining the really epic gear (not to mention, its much more rewarding when you have to work for something).  <br />
<br />
And for the last time, you do not have to be on 24/7 in order to get great gear.  You need a competent, mature guild.  I've been raiding for about 9 months now with my guild.  4 days a week, 3-4 hours a night (and I have a 8-6 job).  Since then, we've cleared all of BWL, AQ40 (up to C'Thun), and we currently have 5 bosses on farm status in Naxx.  <br />
<br />
I've said it in other posts, but you don't have to give up your soul to get great gear in this game.  You just have to find a guild thats the right fit for you.<br />
<br />
In regards to the 25 man raids in the upcoming BC....it kinda sucks having to break up 40 man raid guilds.  It'll cause a rift among a lot of guilds.  Although, if someone slacks, you'll be able to monitor it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">10-10-2006, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">16 hours a week playing WoW sure sounds like you are giving up alot of time and is almost equivelent to the 24/7 argument. However, I agree with gwmort in that if you set your goal to obtain the best &quot;possible&quot; gear you can get, then it will seem more like a reward than a let down when you don't get the top tier gear. I myself wrestle with this all the time when I play. My main goal now is the Low lvl PvP Gear. I PvP quite frequently and have moved swiftly to Mst Sgt in just a couple of weeks. That gear for me looks very good since I too cannot commit to long hours at the keyboard. My guild is also fairly new (we only have a few 60+) most are in the 50+ range with about 20-30 lower lvl than me (46). So for me, if I hit my PvP set goal then I can relax a little when I reach the end knowing I got the best gear &quot;possible&quot; for the time I allocate to play.</div></div><hr />

Sgt. you better get grinding your butt off. All that honor is going to be wiped in 6 weeks or so and the PvP gear in the expansion isn't meant to be as good.</div></div><hr />

Most of us would like to have much time to spend on it but we dont so I m satisfied with it anyway . Enjoy and have , that's the point of this game , if you think that best gear and set is the most important than quit .</div></div><hr />

That is almost impossible for me...looks like I will be downgrading what my hopes were for strong gear:bonk:</div></div><hr />

Was very pleased top have the full rank 10 gear and the fast mount.  Very often I have to re-evaluate my goals and time and adjust accordingly.  I'm at a point where I'm doing MC with my druid and BWL with my shammy.  Thats one day each.  When I'm not in MC or BWL I am farming herbs and resistance gear.  It's just strange how different the end game feels vs. 1-60.  A part of me thinks &quot;Stay with your characters and continue to work on your end game&quot;.  Another part of me just can't wait for blood elves to come out so I can play 1-70 with a new class.  And then there's that nagging angel that appears on my shoulder atleast every couple days that sighs and shakes a clock in my face.  I'm a competitor by nature.  I want what I know I can't have.  I have fun playing WoW but down deep when I see that AQ40 rogue or whatever..I just wish WoW was out 15 years ago.  :eusa_booh<br />

<br />
My guild has been doing AQ40 for a few weeks now (we're up to Fankriss), but no regalia has dropped for us yet.<br />
<br />
Also, since I'm raiding as a tank, and the mace is pretty situational (warden staff is still best) and will only get used when I need a resistance offhand or when I'm doing dps, I'll be passing on it until at least a few casters have gotten their staves. It'll be a few at least a few months before I can get hold of the mace, it seems. :-(</div></div><hr />
