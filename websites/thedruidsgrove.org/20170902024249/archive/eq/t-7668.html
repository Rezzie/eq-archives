Haven't run into him myself but having a very small guild, he's become a huge roadblock to my epic, and I think he'd put a hella damper on any soloing.</div></div><hr />

Charmed pet is a good way to go.  Also bind outside so you can gate if you get into trouble, evac really isn't too useful in fear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used egress to get to safty, run to north wall, egress, run to north wall, egress ............ect, untill I had enough time to camp out. Solo on the north wall is easy, few roamers. You have to kill scarlings for they argo you most times anyway. Exodus does not work in fear btw.<br />
<br />
If you get dispelled, and dont have run 5, you can get in a bad spot. With elemental gear you should be able to channel though on gate/egress. Hell, with Ele gear you should be able to tank most of fear, solo.<br />
<br />
It gets rather boring at 65, most mobs are low exp and armor drops seemed to few. Although it is fun to fun into a full spawn to check what is up.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

Think it was something like at the time there were probably no plans for upgraded charms so if something was too high  for charm it was flagged as uncharmable all together (it still shows the too high msg - which would have been true at the time).   Just kill it off and move along to the next if it doesn't work.<br />
 <br />
It's pretty easy though... nw corner has some wanderers but once you get them killed is a great spot to kite ... egress pt is in the sw corner so should keep mobs clear of there.   Exodus doesn't work in there (I think). Binding outside is a good idea.   The Ireblind Imp can be a pain in the ass but in all actuallity should be of 0 threat since he'll mez you (and I think roam back to his bind pt) and lose aggro.   Just kite him get mezzed then evac/gate when mez is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exodus used to drop you in the middle of the zone a few years back.  I used to pull and off kite in there and used egress or exodus staff to wipe agro.   Was not too dangerous once you pulled the Sanhains that used to roam that area off to the side and killed them.   Maybe that is why it doesn't work now.  If you didn't know what you were doing you could really stir up the mobs. <br />
<br />
I used to charm a warder or shiverback on zonein for extra dps while breaking but yes, I got the &quot;too high level&quot; message lots of times. <br />
<br />
I know necros solo in there so don't see why druids can't.   I do remember a 4 druid, enc, cleric group AoEing in there like crazy. <br />
<br />
As I remember, the North Wall was fairly safe since the mobs can't see through the fire and I don't thank any path on the north side of the fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legwen</div><div class="date">05-04-2004, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">they changed the berserker mob in fear (instead of ireblind himself popping an enraged imp spawns and he is non aggro and despawns in like 30 min or so) so you can kill the scarelings w/o worry.  i solo here quite often, and as long as you have a decent manapool and you can get all the adds you have snared you can easily get this place broken in. once you have that dont this place is easy as pie.  just stay away from the golems, a dt in a bad spot can make for a hairy cr.~</div></div><hr />

Could the DT be eaten by a pet / thus, maybe be soloable?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are all either centered around the caster/mob, or centered around the target...<br />
<br />
It has been this way since eq was created.<br />
<br />
Find me one spell in Lucy that states anything along the lines of &quot;AE Arc 33 degrees&quot; or something similar, and I will concede that there are indeed directional ae's.  But, I can assure you, that ALL ae's only have a range, and a radius, ie are circular, not pie/wedge/directional.</div></div><hr />
