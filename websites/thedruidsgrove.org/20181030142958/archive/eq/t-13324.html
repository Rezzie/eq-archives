Loral doesn't know.  And he's refering to the Tier 2 armor, I would venture there is a tier 3 in Deathknell.<br />
<br />
The armor would need to be at least even with Qvic level but I am gussing 225 hp/mana - 250 hp/mana personally, putting it between Qvic and MPG Raid level.<br />
<br />
That would sound about correct.<br />

Thinking back to when we did some testing there with a dev I'm pretty sure that it was mentioned that the gear there would be better than Qvic.<br />

But my memory could be confused due to excessive whisky and pie consumptian. :shuffle:</div></div><hr />

tier 2 can drop from ToB trash/named.<br />
<br />
tier 1 can drop from Devastation and regular zones.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure but what I forsee was 2 tiers of armor from this expansion, the base common upgrade to ornate level and then the higher theater of blood armor..like what elemental armor was.  I did not consider a full set of armor coming from Deathknell, instead merely common items and 1 class specific item analogous to the tacvi hammer, the Vermiculated cloak, etc.<br />
 <br />
GoD - top end zone had single class item<br />
OoW- top end zone had full set of armor<br />
DoN - top end zone(Vish) had a single class item<br />
DoD - top end zone had archetype armor set and single class item<br />
 <br />
I was not reading the article as their would be a full set of armor from Deathknell, the full raid mobs from ToB being part of the access to DK including them as part of the progression to them.  It would seem like there better be something out there above the ToB trash drop for armor sets though.</div></div><hr />

Deathknell most likely has either other tier of armor or has only non-visible inventory slots such as rings and earrings...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Theater of Blood Trash.<br />
 <br />
Theather of Blood raid mobs?<br />
 <br />
For 3 different sets?</div></div><hr />

I didn't raid ToB in beta so I really wouldn't know.</div></div><hr />
