Hurry hurry hurry!  I so want this. :)<br />

I can just imagine the day when everyone has a home off the electricity grid.  Woot!</div></div><hr />

Sadly, in California the law requires all solar generation to be connected to the grid.  This is a bit complicated but the electronics are built in such a way that the incoming power signal is required for power electronics to extract energy from the solar cells.  This could be overidden but it would be considered illegal by California law or violate the laws required for sale of that equipment.</div></div><hr />

Its probably required to be on the grid where available.  This is probably to give the next owner the option of off or on the grid. <br />
<br />
I know in New Mexico, there is no such power requirement,since there are quite a few communities that are off the grid.</div></div><hr />

A person is not required to be on the grid.  California does this in a sneaky manner.  First, if you have a generator you need a pollution permit.  This makes it more expensive to disconnect from the grid but not being on the grid is legal.<br />
<br />
Now, you can live outside the pollution districts and have a generator.  However, with carbon emission control that may change.<br />
<br />
You can have solar cells but they just won't function without being on the grid. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

A calculator runs on dc power and not ac...  Still, the limit is on inverters that connect to solar cells.  California can create guidelines (which they have) that limit what equipment can be installed.  <br />
<br />
The below is an interesting guide book.  A roof that has 400 SQ ft of solar cells wont produce that much energy... but you can run the lights.  FYI a fully loaded 20 amp circuit is 1,920 watts.  This could run a PC and couple lights.<br />

Some schools in san diego have solar arrays on the roofs.  This effectively pays for the lights during the school year and produce extra when school is out.</div></div><hr />
