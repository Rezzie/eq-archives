The more time lil' rabid bear spends running distance to reach his target, the less time he spends swinging on that target.  Added range = less hits before he poofs.  I wasn't aware there was any focus on increasing this range ~</div></div><hr />

This was actually brought upto me in server wide.  I would assume (and agree) that it's annoying to be 'just' out of reach on those mobs you need to stand slightly back from, then to run forward and then move back.<br />
<br />
Yes, you trade in DPS for range, but that's an option that wasn't available as much before hand.<br />
<br />
Those in channel may also remember people asking to increase the range on Wrath of the Wild, I've been asked to check in again after SoF launch on that, as Nodyin doesn't feel he has time to make sure there are no issues with giving it a longer range prior to launch.<br />

More power to anyone still using this AA.  Now I tell ya what would be spectacular is if they doubled the hit point's of nature's guardian to 2 hps.</div></div><hr />
