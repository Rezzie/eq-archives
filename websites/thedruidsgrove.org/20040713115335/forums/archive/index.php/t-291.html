<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MaeMai</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How fast is <br />
SoW <br />
vs<br />
SoE<br />
vs<br />
Wolf Form?<br />
<br />
Reason I ask is because im trying to kite otters in CS and they run VERY fast and I need to know how to outrun them so I can snare them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CrisisCBD</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harmony first then pull them with ensnare one by one ;) <br />
<br />
wolf form will make you more kos making your agro range bigger, soe is obviously faster then sow I think it is 70%<br />
<br />
check castersrealm or lucy for more tech details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qwin</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pull with snare, it doesn't become an issue. unless you get a resist, then use a root tell you can get snare on, the root spells are very fast casting, and you can often get them off no problem even while being beat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spirit of Wolf - 55%<br />
Wolfform - 55%<br />
Form of the Great Wolf - 60%<br />
Greater Wolf Form - 60%<br />
Spirit of Eagle - 60%<br />
Form of the Howler - 67%<br />
Spirit of Scale - 70%<br />
Form of the Hunter - 72%<br />
Spirit of Cheetah - 115%<br />
<br />
All reported at max level (up to level 65)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paldor</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoW = 30-55% increase.<br />
SoE = 57-60% increase.<br />
Share Form of the Great Wolf = 59% - 62% increase.<br />
Form of the Great Wolf = 57% - 60% increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
So at your  level... &quot;Share Form of the Great Wolf&quot; will be your fastest form, which is interesting that the group version is faster then the solo one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BriennaMonk</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another benefit of SoE besides the slight speed increase is the levitation component.  This allows you to run over up/down areas without losing speed, but the mobs you are pulling have to take the time to go up/down these areas.  I used this to good advantage in CS back when I quadded wyverns.  If I needed a few ticks to med or whatever, I'd run them through a really hilly portion of the beach and get a couple extra ticks med time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glarnor</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flight of Eagles is 65%, I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gamilenka</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can handle the lag, just use SOE.  If can't, then use SoW.  Keeping cheetah mem'd might be a good idea.  It's a good run away real fast so you have time to gate spell.  They have shaman, so a lot of them will have SoW on.<br />
<br />
I would use harmony/harmony of nature on the group first, then pull single with ensare like someone else said.  Shouldn't matter after that.  You should be able to take one or two hits to channel through and get a second snare off if you need to.  Seems to help if you run far enough so that you are at least half way through casting the spell though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xitix</div><div class="date">07-17-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another option is to pull with a dispell which will usually remove the sow and haste the shamans buff them with. It's very east to get far enough ahead to snare once they aren't moving at sow speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MaeMai</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harmony wont work. Getting that message saying that you cannot use or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
Typically when I pull I pull 3 warriors and a shammie. Snare 1 warrior, run by the time I channel thru another ensnare Im getting beat on. I just cant seem to snare them fast enough =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulcraver</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoE in this situation is the one to use.  In many cases it has 3 noticeable effects:<br />
<br />
1. Reduces the times that you get &quot;You can't see your target&quot;, because you are hovering above the virtual geometry.<br />
<br />
2. Creating distance by using elevation is useful in lots of places.<br />
<br />
3. Wherever there is water you can run your prey into then out of the water to slow them down ( I do this lots in PoD when I have 4 or 5 mobs chasing me around).<br />
<br />
SoE is my running spell of choice in all situations because of its versatility.  So it stays permanently memmed for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolodo</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hunted otters for months while working on Tailoring.  Harmony of Nature is the spell you want to use and it works very well.  I used SoE exclusively and Harmony of Natured until I reached 60 and was able to single pull.<br />
<br />
The Harmony you are using must be the lower level version.  <br />
<br />
Once everything is harmonized it is just a matter of snare pulling one at a time until you get 4.  I then would run to top of cliff (ally CoV faction so Drakes and Wyverns leave me alone) and round them up and AoE.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
I would definitely make sure you have the level 29 version of Harmony of Nature.  In over 3 months of hunting these things I think I had one resist of Harmony.<br />
