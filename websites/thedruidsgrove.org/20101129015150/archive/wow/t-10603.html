I tought maybe I'll open some company but I won't so I have some ideas . If some clan need website I can make you whatever you want and you don't need to pay nothing .<br />
<br />
I can make you website or add phpbb2 cause its much better and easyer and more useful than html . If you are interesting just post here .<br />

Depending on your server space you could maybe make subdomains or something like that so a few people could use your offer.<br />
My guild has a website but it needs something like a phpbb2 backend.</div></div><hr />

Love your attitude.  You should know your friendly nature is rare and your willingness to share what you have learned about web development is admirable like a lot of the people here at the druids grove who have shared their successes and strategies.  I am a better druid because of it.</div></div><hr />

I can see that you are realy good man too and I m very glad cause I'm part of this comunity . Maybe my help is not something big but I think it can help some guilds and players in developing and helping they members etc . <br />
Thanks man . Your post is realy full of positive energy and it's realy nice to see it on places like this .</div></div><hr />
