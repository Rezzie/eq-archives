<br />
All of a sudden, I got booted from the server (Eitrigg).  I was back to the screen that shows my character, and it was level 13 not level 14. :eek:<br />
<br />
I tried to login again, but I got a message &quot;World server down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you think I lost all the work I did tonight, or does Blizzard have a data backup somehow? :sumo:</div></div><hr />

It does a little rollback. Lots of dupers use server downs to dupe as well. You probably didn't lose all that work, I think it only rolls back to 4-5 minutes before the server went down.</div></div><hr />
