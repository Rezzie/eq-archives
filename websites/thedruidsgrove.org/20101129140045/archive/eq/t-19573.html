In fact, it isn&#8217;t even close. Insurers are well-aware of this fact (see this  from the Australian insurance company AAMI), and hence they often charge women lower premiums.<br />

Oh poop, but later on it goes to say &quot;Li et al. found that male drivers are 80 percent more likely to be in a fatal accident than women on a per mile basis. Massie et al. confirmed this, finding men are 55 percent more likely to be in fatal crashes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Women are more likely to run into stationary objects or back into something.  (Been there, done that!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess!  Then look.</div></div><hr />

When a man/woman couple is in the car the norm is for the man to drive. It's not that I'm sexist and think it should be that way, it's just one of those things. Males are also overrepresented in jobs that require driving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyyr</div><div class="date">03-12-2010, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It says per mile basis.<br />
I will assume then that it is standardized.<br />
<br />
So that would account for hours behind wheels, or jobs as drivers.<br />
<br />
I wonder how they account for the oblivious drivers, who are not actually involved in the accident, but cause it, then drive on completely unaware.  I have seen this more often with elderly drivers(usually a blue haired woman).<br />
<br />
The vast majority of asshole aggressive drivers are males, in my experience.  That they cause proportionately more accidents is fairly intuitive.<br />
<br />
And I wonder if they/anyone have the guts to publish the racial makeup of accident causers.  That would be interesting.</div></div><hr />

My gut instinct is that (some, not all) young men are probably the worst drivers, too much testosterone makes you take risks and act agressively.  Things people with heavy, machines going at high speeds shouldn't do. I think the insurance industry agrees with me on that. :)<br />
<br />
Ah, you poor guys.  You should really try estrogen.  Then you won't mind going to movies and crying.</div></div><hr />
