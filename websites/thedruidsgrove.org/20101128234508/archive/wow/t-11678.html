You nd to use all ur forms, stuns, cat dmg, cyclone, maim, stomp(tauren), root, natures grasp, spot heals  etc.. all the tricks of the trade. Playing style, when and how u use skills. Equipment, ur dmg ouput, ur resistance and surviablity. Stats, please bring a long mana, Most classes play droods to form shift alot and once yah have no mana = death. Healing = keeping others alive!<br />
<br />
Get in and practice. Do normal BGs to get use to killing and dying and having fun!</div></div><hr />

You can form a team at the Ring of Trials in Nagrand or Circle of Blood in blade's edge mountains.  <br />
<br />
Once you form a team, you can join the battle right there or just see the Arena battlemaster in any major city to join the queue.<br />

I just started in the 2 v 2 arena so I don't claim to be an expert.  However, I did learn a few things very quickly:<br />
<br />
First is that the teams that beat us all had one thing in common - they turned the match into a 2 v 1 match fast.  And I mean *fast*.  Note that you don't need to kill an opponent to do this - Sap, Fear, Polymorph and Cyclone do this as well.<br />
<br />
Second is that whatever your typical PvP or PvE strategy is, it won't always work in the arena.  Indeed, your normal strategy might well be a dismal failure in the ring (mine was).  Rather than stick to my default, I had to work with my teammate to figure out how our classes work together the best.<br />
<br />
Different classes have different strengths and you have to play those strengths to the max.  IMO, any combination of class can be lethal in the arena so long as they play well together.<br />
<br />
Third is time management - most matches I've been in have been less than 60 seconds.  Once my teammate and I worked out a strategy, I wrote macros so I could do my job as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm pretty much an arena noob, but that's what I've learned so far.  HTH.</div></div><hr />
