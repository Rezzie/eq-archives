<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elo7th</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello :) I need some advice on Riwwi. I tried a search on it but I guess using Riwwi as a search term is too generic and doesn't work. I stopped playing EQ hardcore when GoD came out due to real life and haven't ever really learned much about most of the zones. I have been to Vxed a lot and love the experience there but I read about some nice trash drops in Riwwi and have some questions about the zone. Is it the zone right at the druid port in spot to Barindu? What's the best way to fight here, kiting or root/rotting? Can I expect summoners or non snareable/rootable mobs? I have mostly crap gear for a level 65 so I could really use some upgrades and love a change of scenery so any help on this zone would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but somewhat close. You can get there invis. It is however a lot closer than porting to natimbi though.<br />
<br />
What's the best way to fight here, kiting or root/rotting?<br />
<br />
too many adds to kite, you can root/dot in the coliseum just fine. Named can be nasty if you're not prepared though, and most named summon.<br />
<br />
Can I expect summoners or non snareable/rootable mobs?<br />
<br />
Yes. The named. :) I think Kyvs are immune to runspeed debuffs. If not others... has been a while.<br />
<br />
Btw Firefox rox :)<br />
<br />
If you're looking for that BP, then you can just kill trash mobs for it... however if you're looking for named drops.. prepare for a beating. Named can hit as hard as Elem mobs but a whole lot faster. Pulling named that are outside the Colliseum is hard because of the adds, not saying impossible because it isnt :D but it is hard for an inexperienced puller. The named inside the colliseum are mostly casters, but still hit hard and summon and not to mention have nasty spells.</div></div><hr />

I am mostly looking for the BP to replace my Elysian that I am SO sick of wearing. Since it sounds like I can kill trash mobs there without a problem I guess it will just be a matter of patience.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">02-09-2005, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup just stick to the colliseum arena, that's a good place to solo at. Be careful of the wanderers that kill the Taelosians that come through the sides.<br />
<br />
What i did when i was BiC hunting was harmony the spectators and pull them down. Really easy to do. You can also pull from the sides, but be careful you need to harmony a lot.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes it can be a named that if I recall hits fairly hard. Also, don't kill the slaves. It just isn't nice :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stephen51</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres a part of the Breakdown In Communications quest (BIC), that can be done seperately from it, and yields a nice neck/belt item. See the Riwwi part under http://www.frmug.org/~archer/Breakdown.html . It isnt easy, but all can be 1 grouped, some parts less. Theres faction building, camping named, ground spawns, random drops and you need your begging skill up to 151. But the end item, ac 25, all stats 7, all saves 7, FT3, Attack 15, 2 aug slots a type 3 and 7, isnt bad :)</div></div><hr />

(not the named, just a regualar kyv) I watched him walk in one end of the arena and waited for him to leave then went about the slaughter not realizing he went around and came back in behind me. He is fast as hell and resisted snare the 2 times I could cast it before finally having to exodus. Interesting spot though and I will be back for my surcoat of tragedy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also charm a hynid and use it to kill in the arena (pulling spectators down or pulling from the sides).  Probably give you a faster kill rate than straight root/dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea but be careful with the hynid charming, cause it breaks often and there's not much space to kite in there to recharm, especially if the slave killers are up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">02-10-2005, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya; when I was down there I tried charming. Glamour of tunare helps (seemingly) to make the charm last a bit longer, but it by no means does it last that long. I charmed the tortured hynids that are in a cell near in the stadium, and found that they were HUGE mana hogs for tanking. The best bet that I found with them is to charm it, haste it, and dot/aggro kite the mob you are killing so your pet gets to just beat on the mobs back.</div></div><hr />
