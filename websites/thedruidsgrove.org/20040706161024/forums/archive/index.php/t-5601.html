<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darklotuss</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone, i know there are alot of posts on people and their specific gear problems and questions on how to remedy them. Well here is one more. I am a 62 druid with crappy gear for my lvl. Mostly elysian except for my woven grass legs. have tae ew shield golden idol of tunare. curved lunar scimitar. have the hate bracer +9 wis supple scale armband earing of the solstace  blue diamond earing for resists cloak of the wise circle toe bones in one ring slot JC + 6 wis ring on the other neck is a neclace off of dragon in WW +4 all stats and resists and regular extra resist gear in a bag pretty standard stuff. was wondering if you fellows druids could tell me the best way to get some new gear. IE not in a guild dont have time to be in one. Places to solo for upgrades or ways to make plat in a short amount of time to be able to buy stuff in bazaar. almost done with my epic just need Frog (what a joke) fey and that sea horse in KK. no flags except for zones in can get into lvl restriction wise. Thanks to all who post  you guys are like a library of info. (also if you could tell me how to use that darn maeglo profile system would have made this easier)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">11-12-2003, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All this info holds true to e-marr...prices may vary depending on server, population, etc...<br />
<br />
Well...you could probly do decently making plat depending on your server economy hunting for tradeskill supplies in WW.<br />
<br />
Ring of thunderous spirits is a common drop in BoT (from my experience) and you can usually find them sold for 2k on my server.<br />
<br />
Shadel bandit ring is also a good ring, it is soloable, but takes a while, so if you have plat may cost around 2k. Usually less.<br />
<br />
Definately finish epic.<br />
<br />
You should try and get a group together and try doing trials in PoJ, can get a decent mask off of them, or buy it for a few thousand plat in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
Im not sure what level restriction on BoT is (either 62 or 63...not sure as I was flagged way before the change), but, if you can get in there, and do tower raids, you can get a nice amount of gear if you get lucky.<br />
<br />
There are 4 towers, sand, blizzard, lightening and wind. Wind drops ornate leather tunic pattern, lightening drops an ft2 hat. Sand and Blizzard don't really drop anything of importance to a druid, however, all the towers have a good chance of dropping runes...so it can be a nice way to get your 65 spells, and possibly cash if you get duplicates.<br />
<br />
Also, if you can get into a group (probobly not as main healer with your gear and whatnot, you will most likely run out of mana fast) you can get spectral parchments and ornate molds off of regular exp group mobs. I believe that the wind wing boss, laef, drops the ornate leather legs rarely, and that wybjorn (a named in lightening wing) drops the ornate leather sleeves rarely. In MS (middle sands ) there are 2 nameds that pop by the table here. One is a wolf, one is a giant and I forget the names.  The giant can drop ornate leather cap (or boots) I believe. If you are standing at this table, and look up towards Upper Sands camp, then you will see 2 openings one to the left and one to the right. If you go to the one to the right and 2 rooms up, you will see a forge. 2 nameds can spawn at this forge. Another wolf and another giant. I haven't killed the giant, but I believe that the wolf drops ornate leather boots (or cap).<br />
<br />
So to summarize.<br />
WINGS:<br />
wind-laef-legs<br />
sand-table giant and forge wolf-cap and boots<br />
lightening-wybjorn-sleeves<br />
TOWERS<br />
wind-aulliffe-tunic<br />
lightening-ft2 hat<br />
<br />
wow, i rambled a lot....but those are some ways to get upgrades. Realise that most of the drops are quite rare, so it may take a while to get all of them. Good Luck!</div></div><hr />
