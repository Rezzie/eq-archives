If you have a yellow quest for a dungon... there's where you should be.<br />
<br />
27 I think Shadow Fang Keep is a good dungon for your level, or maybe Scarlet Monestry.<br />
<br />
The true strength of having a good set of heal gear, and watching health bars more then looking for your next crit is you'll do better in dungons.  There's few encounters that you need wicked DPS to beat, most are just Tank and Heal and win.</div></div><hr />

I got great XP there and some pretty good drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">10-20-2006, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Black Fathom Deeps, I believe it is, wouldn't be too bad for your level, either. And, if you ever want to get ahold of a nice +stamina and +intellect belt, the final boss drops the &quot;Moss Cinch.&quot; The guy before that drops a good staff, as well.<br />
<br />
To make it easier on you (I may have massacred some of the spellings):<br />
<br />
Black Fathom Deeps is in Northwestern Ashenvale.<br />
<br />
Shadow Fang Keep  is in Mid-Western Silverpine Forest (Take the boat from Auberdine to Menethil, then follow the road north to Arathi Highlands. From there, take the road west to Hilsbrad, pick up the flight path at Southshore. Continue West/North-west to Silverpine)<br />
<br />
Gnomeregan is in the Mid-Western area of Dun Morogh. I'm sure you've been to Ironforge for your Aqua Form quest, so take the gryphon from Menethil to IF, then walk out into the snowy land, and travel West.<br />
<br />
Razorfen Downs... I'm not sure of the exact, having never done it, but I believe it is in Southern Barrens (South of Eastern Ashenvale)--Do NOT mistake for Razorfen Kraul.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Monastery I would not advise, personally. It's lowest leveled section is the Graveyard, and that's levels 29-34ish. I suggest going to Scarlet Monastery at level 33+. Anyway, to get there it's basically the same drill as Shadowfang... except now head north to Trisifal Glades. Scarlet Monastery is in the top North-Eastern corner... Be careful to avoid Undercity and Bree, as well as the Deathguards. AKA, try to avoid the road. Also, there is a shortcut to Trisifal. In Southshore, head due north to Alterac Mountains. Once there, head West to Dalaran; do not enter the snowy regions--stick to the grass. Follow the lake's side until you reach the far northern area, and then swim across the lake, in aqua form, past the castle. This puts you in Trisifal Glade.<br />
<br />
Hope that was of some help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stockades is a somewhat good one. u will get exp and a good amount of money.<br />
<br />
Shadowfang Keep is a good instance for ur lvl and one i would recommend<br />
<br />
BlackFathom Deep is a very good instance for ur lvl and one i would extremly recommend.<br />
<br />
If u can find a grp that will invite u to Gnomer or RFK then join them but u might die a good deal sense ur still 2 lvls below.. <br />
<br />
here is a list of the instances (RFC, Stockades, and ZF are at the bottom)<br />

I hate it so much ... i flat out refuse to go there even with my guild. Halfway through the damn instance i had to switch my sound off. That music will make me commit suicide.</div></div><hr />

I am never going to Gnomer again, if I have any say about it... Figures, though, that it has great leggings and a good mace for a feral druid at 30 ish range.</div></div><hr />
