Currently, I've gone all Resto in an effort to get Innervate, which would basically give me and anyone in my guild a limitless amount of mana. When I first started, I always used my normal form instead of feral forms. That all changed upon getting my cat form...<br />
<br />
I'm now finding myself in normal form only to cast buffs, dot spells, and to heal. Other than that, I'm always in cat form. My question is, should I reset my talent points and put them into Feral? If so, which build should I go with? I already know it would be ?-?-5, so I can get improved Mark of the Wild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually most feral druids find furor tobe better points spent than improved mark.  <br />
<br />
If you want to own in cat I think the best pure feral build is 14/32/5, with OoC, Natural Shapeshifter, and furor along with a well structured feral build.<br />
<br />
Most people realize they will need to heal eventualy and dilute it by putting a lot of points in resto, hence the now ubiquitous 0/30/21.</div></div><hr />

Just out of curiousity, why did you go with improved wrath over Nature's grasp?  I love hitting NG while shifting to break cc while running with the flag in WSG (rooting pursuers is cool)</div></div><hr />

<br />
45 seconds sounds ridiculously short but its not.  Thats practically enough time to cheetah all the way across WSG.  Often you know you are about to get hit on (before charging into a group of mobs in bear) and can plan ahead a little, no one keeps it up all the time, that would be crazy.  But it definitely has its uses.</div></div><hr />

The Nature's Grasp has helped me get what ever it was off me (usually an annoying hunter's pet) or its still active when I shift out of cheetah into Moonkin form and deal with a few incoming.<br />

Don't even think about trying that on our server ... I've never had nor seen a successful flag steal by a moonkin lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for your build?  I suggest going mostly feral.  You can respec later to resto if you choose.  But for leveling purposes, feral is great.  You will still be an effective healer in instances.  Also, you mentioned that you were turned off by Nature's Grasp because it can only be used outdoors and therefore its lack of usefulness in dungeons.  If you're getting beat on to the point where you need to even think about casting it, then your tank isn't doing a good job or you're overhealing, or just doing way too much damage.  Either way, someone screwed up and Nature's Grasp most likely won't help.  <br />
<br />
In world PvP/dueling/BGs, Nature's Grasp is very useful.  Especially against rogues who tend to get the jump on you.  They will hit you once, and instantly get rooted (w/ all 5pts).  At that point that rogue will be dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you spam wrath when it's got like a 2.5 - 3 sec cast time? NG has a cooldown of a minute too... lasts 45 sec so you'll have what - maybe a chance to cast 13 or 14 wraths provided you dont kill your MP pool first.<br />
<br />
Also, what's the interruption chance of wrath on an NG victim? High chance of breaking them loose?</div></div><hr />

I just got my first flag cap in the 50-59 bracket this weekend and I'm moonkin.  Helped to have the armor and the ability to use potions and swiftboots, etc...<br />
<br />
and its fricking hilarious to see him booking it down the tunnel when I can get the run speed power-up.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd never do it but if it works for you then more power to ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-29-2006, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never use Nature's swiftness to insta cast wrath, thats just wrong.  <br />
<br />
However Rayze is a little over onthe cast time, I think its only 2 seconds, with improved wrath maxed its at 1.5, and on a nature's grace proc (following a critical) its down to one second.  Not many mobs can interrupt a 1 second cast time, if you place it between their swings.<br />
<br />
I can usually get 3 wraths off in the time for one SF, with much better damage on average, unless that SF crits.</div></div><hr />
