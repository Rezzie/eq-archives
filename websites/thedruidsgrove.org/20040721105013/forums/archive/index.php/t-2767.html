Before the change I turned in a rune and got this spell, wish I had known of the patch change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spuzy</div><div class="date">03-08-2003, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the whole point of this change was to prevent wasting a Druid Rune turn in on a multi-use spell that is obtainable by other classes at a lower level.  So, to answer your question, yes, it means you won't get it as a Rune, at least I think you won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">03-09-2003, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd think they'd do it that way.  More likely Verant have just made it so you no have 2 chances of getting the spell.<br />
<br />
Look forward to many duplicates of this spell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teaenea</div><div class="date">03-15-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verant changed it.  You won't get Destroy Summoned with Runes.  It was more of a change geared towards Hybrids, but, Druids are benefitting from it too.<br />
<br />
Example of what was going on:<br />
<br />
Rangers were turning in Spectrals for Circle of Summer and SoE.</div></div><hr />

After Patch: Destroy Summon with ethereal :(</div></div><hr />

ENC.<br />
<br />
Many clerics in my guild were turning in Ethereals to the enchanter spell quest npc, complaining that they had all the useless byproducts of such an action.<br />
