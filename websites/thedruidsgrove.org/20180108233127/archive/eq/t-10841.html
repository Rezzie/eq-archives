<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amingo</div><div class="date">02-19-2005, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right before Luclin came out I gave my friend my account as school, and real life were catching up to me. Well, he recently quit EQ and because of that gave me back my account. I've been playing L2/WoW for the past year or so and I'm not very familiar with all of the changes. So... I'm left with a 65.5 druid and no real idea of where to go and solo. I don't have time to get into groups, or go on raids so any relatively safe solo spots where I can get back into my &quot;groove&quot; would be nice. <br />

 Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

  If it doesn't work, then goto to the Quests, Strats and more section. Then find the message: Hunting grounds. <br />

  Welcome back to EQ.  Hope you enjoy those two places! They will get you fast into the groove.</div></div><hr />

To this day I just want to swat anything that makes a buzz (RL or ingame). And I've never been able to quad there as when I bring the mobs close to the zone in, their pathing makes em' scatter all about. Thanks SOE. :mad2:</div></div><hr />

Nobles Causeway really isn't that bad if your not flagged for PoFire.  In my experience the best solo experience comes from Fire though.  I bothered to solo a few mobs there last week and recieved 11% AA exp per kill at tables.  Another zone you could try is Harbinger's Spire,  the exp isnt that good but the mobs are easy to kill and you can solo the named.  I am surprised someone hasnt menitoned PoStorms also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">voronus</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If for have your KT flag you can solo Yxxta for 8-10% AA per mob in the primal caves.  There is a tiny chance to get a nice item too as its a random drop from any mob.  The mobs have about the same hps as table mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrvell</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The items he is referrng to are the Attuned Discord Earring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26856) and Glowing Bone Ring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26690).  They are nice but I would not choose to exp in Yxxta solely based on the chance of getting one of them.  They are both drops off zone trash from both sides but are extremely extremely rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exp in primal caves is actually quite good, even at 70. However the mobs hit hard, fast, and flurry occasionaly.</div></div><hr />

It has reasonable exp (roughly 4% aa per kill solo and without a charmed pet. So far I've hardly ever seen anyone in there and the kills are very easy with plenty of cats to charm if that sort of thing floats your boat. Mobs tend to hit for a max of about 450 with spiders proccing poison and cats proccing a slow.</div></div><hr />
