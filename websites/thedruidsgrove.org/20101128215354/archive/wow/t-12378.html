<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mookee</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am new to the druid class. I played an alliance warlock on Stomrage and quit once I got to 70. After a year break I decided to give WoW another try. I rerolled as a hrode druid on Akama, and I power leveled to 60 in under 4 days played, kitty form FTW.<br />
<br />
But now I am 62, and I main tank BC instances pretty often, but I am alittle unsure of how important certain stats are for tanking. Armor, Defense rating, resilience, so many to choose from.<br />
<br />
In my old guild as a warlock, myself and another made a &quot;point&quot; system, to give people the general idea as to how to detirmine if something was an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Example. 1 Spell Damage = 1 point<br />
              1% crit = 5 points<br />
              10 int = 1 point.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone has such a forumula for Feral tanking gear? Or any insight as to which stats are the most important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Haven enough +def (or +res) to be uncritable for the boss in the instance you are running.<br />
<br />
2) Take as much +sta, +agi and armor as the gear you have in your bags allows.<br />
<br />
Once you reach lvl 70, there is a nice pre-Kara gear guide mentioned in this thread (http://thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/showthread.php?t=12272) that you should look at.  In fact, check it out now.  As some of the items you can get from the early instances.</div></div><hr />

Further more, is demo roar useful enough to keep in a hotbar?  or just save my rage for single target Mangles and move Demo roar back to the spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Demo roar has a use, but it is not for handling multiple mobs.  I use it at some point after i have established a good amount of threat on a single mob (typically bosses) as an AP debuff.  It does not generate enough threat to help hold multiple mobs.<br />
<br />
As a new feral tank, I highly recommend you read the &quot;Useful Articles&quot; (top left side) of http://teethandclaws.blogspot.com/ and &quot;Useful posts&quot; (middle right side) of http://bigbearbutt.blogspot.com/.  Both of those bear blogs offer top-notch advice.<br />
<br />
I've read them all a few times.  And keep hard-copies in the bathroom. ;D<br />
<br />
BTW, here's the direct link to the tanking multiple mobs (http://bigbearbutt.blogspot.com/2007/10/bear-tanking-strategies-for-multiple.html) article.  In short, make sure everyone gives you time to establish agro (~10s is great, but don't expect more than 3s!) before they start spaming their DPS, or heals, and use a mouseover lacerate macro, followed by swipes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last night doing a quick Arca run a pally and a shammy seemed to try to get in the attack even before i'd pulled the mob to the spot i wanted for tanking.<br />
<br />
pally even said i was doing a good job cos i was keeping above her threat which people usually have trouble with :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
i always say to people 'you pull it, you tank it'.<br />
<br />
a couple of deaths or so usually proves my point :biggrinfl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-08-2008, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree.  I ran Durnhold 2 nights ago (all of us lvl 70) and one of the super-geared shammies kept spaming chain lightning almost as soon as I pulled.  Needless to say, he tanked a few mobs most of the night.  We had excessive DPS, so in the end it really didn't matter.<br />
<br />
When it really counts (raid/heroic trash, boss mobs) most DPS'r know they have to wait a bit, even with a warrior tank.  Sometimes, though, they have to be reminded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'You yank it, You tank it'.  <br />
<br />
I suspect he has it on a macro button, but I'm proud to say he's never had to say it to my hunter.</div></div><hr />
