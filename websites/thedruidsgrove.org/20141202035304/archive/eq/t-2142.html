<br />
I do know a 65 druid that soloed him but its a bit of luck involved in charm not breaking :) <br />
<br />
I did mine pre-PoP so I assume now all you would really need is a slower, healer, tank, and someone to single pull.  With our wondrous druid power you have two of those positions knocked out. :evil: <br />
<br />
Someone correct me if I'm totally off on thinking here.</div></div><hr />

I am lvl 60 as I said above, and would be using DC for the pet so as to not worry about it breaking.  I have SCM3 and would wear my ODS to save mana on heals.  I have about 3300-3600 mana depending on resist gear.<br />
<br />
I have epic, and bracer for click DoTs and Gloves of Earthcrafting for click DS.  <br />
<br />
I have a horse, and would have KEI for mana regen.<br />
<br />
What I am hoping for is to see if someone around my lvl or manapool has ever done this, or for someone to post a strategy on how to attempt this.<br />
<br />
I would assume that I would have to save all my mana for heals, and only use my clickables for damage.  I would DC a animal (not sure which is best, someone suggested a wolf above but would have to be DC-able) give it PoTC, regen, Savage S., and click DS through fight.<br />

Please post your thoughts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tistali0n</div><div class="date">06-24-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this kinda recently with an enc. I'll be doing it 2box with my enc when I get round to it I imagine.<br />
<br />
I'm 65, and at the time I had FT 13 or so, but loadsa AAs (scm, mc3, etc, etc ... all bar DC basically).<br />
<br />
This above to give you a baseline in relation to the following :<br />
<br />
I charmed a wolf, didn't DC since I didn't have it, never wanted it, clicked it by accident recently ;-/. Enc charmed a mammoth - because it was walking by.<br />
Solo pull cap - ok you can't level based solo pull? Harmony owns for it then. Harmo cap, Harmo every other giant in the line behind cap, then tag cap.<br />
Get more than one? egress or exodus are your friend, altho DC pet won't be ;-/<br />
<br />
Pull itself was with the ceramic ring thing we get - very low aggro compared to say snare. One hit from pet will pull aggro off you. Very cheap to buy.<br />
<br />
Run back to tunnel entrance, stick both pets on.<br />
<br />
Mob is not MR slowable, you're looking at all damage being done by pets OR fire nukes - and of course DS damage which can be substantial. Debuff of course to help it stick. Personally due to crit chances I never dot unless it's free and will 100% stick nowdays. So no dots used by me for this fight.<br />
<br />
I healed pet using our CH copy, of course. Also pet had DS, and hp buff (eh, why not /shrug). <br />
Initially I was chain CHing on pet and a couple were kinda close. After a while it settled down, and I nuked lots too. I might have stuck sotw on pet at one point, but for the DS increase, not the healing.<br />
I think TR was doing 2/3 of pet hps, something I had not tested before fight. Keep in mind my AA make my heals bigger.<br />
<br />
I ended the fight with lots of mana, at least 50%. I had voq, 9, etc, etc - enc + dru buffs.<br />
<br />
Choice of pet ... Wolves are your DPS pet in WW, but relatively low hps. Mammoth is middle for dps / hps, and rhino for low dps but hps - all unparsed, just my opinion. The idea was the wolf would do dps and the mammoth would tank, but as it turned out the wolf tanked, prolly due to pulling aggro from it's dps. We didn't have charm break during, but both at 65, and really high cha (my cha is almost max IIRC), and both pets full tashed.<br />
Wolves can be DCable, first mob I ever DC'd was a wolf, which then ran into an IB and got uncharmed 5 seconds later ;-/<br />
<br />
Fight was very fast, and totally trivial. Obviously we had 2 pets and my nuke damage. I was expecting it to be a lot longer, and a lot harder ... but that's memory blurring the reality .. I remember the days when this quest was added and people were looking to loot their first piece of HoT armor. And how this quest was chain triggered, but that's another story.<br />
<br />
Since doing this, I've run past a group trying to do it, and jumped in to help em with their permission. Ok, my AAs gonna mess this up as a comparisoon and I DON'T suggest you do this, BUT I had no problem tanking him, holding aggro, healing myself with TR/KR and nuking him. Part way thru this method, I gave up letting them tank, and aimed to tank, had their cleric heal me instead. Got xp, which sucked since we didn't make a raid.<br />
<br />
Hum, so .. in the future I was planning to do this for my 2box enc, who now doesn't need robe ;-/ .. My plan initially was to replicate the fight I noted above with 2 pets. Also, as noted I can DC a wolf to stop the risk of charm break. But since I know I can tank, there seems only one reason to try this - the &quot;can a druid solo cap&quot; thing. <br />
<br />
It seems like it's not too viable for you, but I really would advise you just to drag along a friend or two and yeah, throw in a charm pet for dps on the kill, and concentrate on healing a real tank while pet does dps.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to do it? It was possible to kill yeldema before druid CH and AAs, and some of us did it, for the sake of it. You rely heavily on pet not breaking charm tho, unless you use DC. Of course you can CH now too, which helps a LOT. I'd probably approach this in the same manner - you are out to do AS MUCH dps as possible as quick as possible, to reduce your chance of charm breaking .. in which case, stack on debuffs, and dots, and nuke like mad, only stopping to ch pet as close to limit as you can - make the ch count. Manadump. Because your risk is pet break, not oom - you should be able to med back TR mana in time it takes pet to be damaged for the value TR will heal ... ie, you should in theory be able to have pet fight cap for ever, until basically cap dies or charm breaks.<br />
<br />
You mention you have DC, so I'd go for a mix of the above. Keep 800 mana for TR's. Nuke away 2/3 of your mana bar, healing with TR as necessary. Ok, you got 2 and a bit (maybe 3) TR's in the bank, so now sit tight on horsie, and just heal pet as needed. Your mana imo should go up more than pet needs healing, feel free to use it for more nukes =p<br />
Saying this based on you having say pog + mask + kei + prolly FT 2 minimum, more likely you have FT3&lt;&gt;FT7 because boot+shawl+earring. Here, we are back to the scenario I mentioned above where you basically have to out-mana regen cap's DPS, because pet won't ever break. I think it's totally possible. And you don't have to be limited to KEI, VoQ is available. I really would say, debuff him as much as is humanly possible, because pet WILL be taking MUCH more damage than you would. Wolf pet has high DPS output tho. STR it too!<br />
<br />
One thing to watch .. enrage. I have a recollection enrage nearly killed my pet (we had another at the time so I didn't care). <br />
<br />
For giggles, an alternate method to practice some interesting skills ... I think the dps on this mob should balance.<br />
Aggro kite using DC'd pet.<br />
So .. dc +soe+haste pet. DS yourself up like mad. get all your other buffs too. Load fast heal, and dot.<br />
<br />
Pull cap and run around chain snare + ensnare over and over for a whole bunch of time. Say 3 - 5 mins.<br />
<br />
Now kite past your DC pet, and /pet attack cap.<br />
Ok, the mob will ignore pet for a long time and you aggro kite. It's gonna summon you .... but so what? On summon, run the other way (ie, reverse direction) - to help pet keep DPS up. Run away a bit, and heal a little if needed.  Spam some more Ensnare / snares. Get summoned again and reverse. Use ALL your mana for healing and snare to keep aggro, let pet do all the damage. You could certainly aggro kite to say 50% in this method  - and in the brief time you are summoned and still in melee range, you will take MUCH less damage (1-2 round) than pet will take tanking for that 10~ seconds.<br />
<br />
Why I think this can work - I have done this on Lodizal, for giggles as I mentioned. It took about 30 minutes. Lodi has a proc, and can quad (or at least triple), for 350 on me, maybe more. So, he has higher DPS than cap, for sure. I think my aa /gear /level can be offset against this higher DPS, and the encounter might be roughly on a par. First time, I didn't have DC (LOL) so I had to keep recharming cougars .. and rehasting them. 2nd time, DC, it became trivial, now I just do it if someone wants to have it proved that druid can solo Lodi.<br />
<br />
I have killed lodi much more, and it's SO MUCH easier to just take some helpful friends along and kill in &lt;5 mins. In my case that's a 2box enc slave to slow, then I just tank and nuke. In your case, it's a tank, maybe a cleric, so you can nuke. Just make a deal with em - we do it 3 times, till all have the item. And /ran 1-3 for who wins today. Scout is hardly a contested mob any longer.<br />
<br />
Well, gonna go log on and aggro kite cap for a laugh =p GL in your attempt, whatever method you choose -)</div></div><hr />
