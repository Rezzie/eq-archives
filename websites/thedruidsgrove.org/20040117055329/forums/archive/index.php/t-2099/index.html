<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday, I was frustrated with finishing my BoT Tower key, no one ever camps the North side giants.  (Ghetto Giants)<br />
<br />
So I decided I would try and get my Tornado Stone by myself.  A quick scouting report told me a militis was all melee (bad for druids)  So I picked on the casters.<br />
<br />
1) Druid mob - easy fight, very little melee, and put it down.<br />
2) Cleric mob - easy fight, was killing it, had it at 18 percent when it C-Healed and I was at 40 mana.  I egress'd.<br />
<br />
My tally, 1 for 2, no deaths.  I got a Tornado Stone and then had to run to the raid.<br />
<br />
The mobs there give roughly 3 blues of exp solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>coea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Could you explain please how you got the kill on the first mob without it gating? I can think of a variety of scenarios but they all involve you being lucky. <br />
<br />
It would be impressive to me at least if the mob did not gate because some tactic, superior to nuking when it gets low and hoping for a crit or random gate interrupt, was used.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If it was a long fight, the mob probably ran out of mana trying to nuke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our stun spells work outdoors.<br />
Although they are imune to the stun itself it does stop them from casting/gating etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Easiest way to stop a mob from gating has been overlooked, fight it near its bind spot.<br />
<br />
If it gates then all it does is move 20'.<br />
<br />
Sadly, at the dps to mana ratio we have, its tough to chain in enough stuns and nukes to drop a mob that can c-heal.  Really takes two people =|<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A stun that a mob is immune to will still prevent it from gating?<br />
<br />
I've never seen that happen...but then I rarely load stuns against stun immune mobs. :)  If true, it seems like a bug...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Honeyblossom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Okay first of all they are not immune just highly resistant.  I know this because is use Storm's Fury and it works to stop gaters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Alyn Cross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i believe it is level restricted. often fury of air does not stun (get immune message, dd works) and storm's fury does stun (no immune message, dd works, mob stops ~3sec.) on the same mob.<br />
likely the same is true with the 'wind' spell line.<br />
I use the furys a lot when agro-kiting in fire, and see that happen on (i believe) every mob.<br />
