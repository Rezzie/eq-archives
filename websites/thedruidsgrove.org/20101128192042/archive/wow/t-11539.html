To get to UC, then the rest of the world, you take the transporter in Silvermoon City. It is located in the NW of the city, Spire of the Sun or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from what i've seen, BE's can grind and quest in Silvermoon and Ghostlands, which are Horde territories... TG isn't contested either, right?<br />
<br />
offhand, I'd say STV for the 20-40 gankiing... that's what i've seen on the crushridge server, anyways...<br />
<br />
go ahead... fuel the Horde vs. alli war... that's (kind of) what makes PvP so damn much fun (except that when i get surprise ganked in the middle of questing)<br />
<br />
I know that as soon as i hit 70 im going to spend the following month and a half (at least) ganking alli lowbies. it's all payback, as far as I'm concerned ;)<br />
<br />
FOR THE HORDE!</div></div><hr />

I'm not a spiteful ganker, but a little payback is always fun.  I just had an urge to gank all the lowbie blood elves :)  Though now that most of them are 40 - 50 +, I really don't care.  Until they show up in the outlands...<br />
<br />
I got ganked plenty of times everywhere I was questing / grinding post lv 30, and it always made me frustrated, but more motivated to lvl 60 so I could hold my own.  <br />
<br />
I have no interest post 60 of going and randomly ganking just to be an a-hole; I'm happy slaughtering same lvl horde in the Outlands. But yeah, horde v alli definitley is a war, and the main reason I rolled on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />
