My tracking picks him up...but i keep running into dead ends even though he is still on tracking.<br />
I heard lock picking is not needed anymore. I got all doors open. I just cannot find him.<br />
Any idea?</div></div><hr />

Can't discribe exactly where,  but the lord spawns in a specific set of rooms but just kill everything on the bottom floor till he spawns. I think the Picklaw Destroyers are the PH for the named but they may be completly random.</div></div><hr />

Lord pickclaw spawns behind a locked door 90% of teh time in the same spot.<br />
I used to use agro tricks to get mobs to open the door for me but i think that wont work anymore. Anyhow its been awhile, good luck.</div></div><hr />
