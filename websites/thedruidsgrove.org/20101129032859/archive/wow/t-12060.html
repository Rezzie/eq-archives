<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * Brewfest has begun and members of the Horde and Alliance can enjoy a multitude of activities, quests, items, and even Ram Racing. As Brewfest is about beer and food, revelers can sample the best beverages available in the world.<br />
    * Hallow’s End: Observed by both the Horde and the Alliance, Hallow's End is the celebration of the break between the Forsaken and the Scourge. Adventurers can speak to innkeepers to get silly masks to wear during their adventures, and much more. This is just one way to celebrate Hallow's End.<br />

<br />
If so, I'd like to see them make flight paths fly at 2x the existing speed.  Or, better yet, make flights paths instant after you have flown it Z number of times.</div></div><hr />

It's not very big. I think the main reason for the extra graveyards is mainly to speed up the leveling process a very small bit (but it will help for sure)</div></div><hr />

When equipped, these goggles cause all humans (including players) and all giants to appear instead as gnomes.<br />

Gruul is a sight to behold...  =)<br />
