The idea will be to keep up the leveling pace with other people in your guild or comminity.  I have always wished I was actually accumulating all the xp from the batlegrounds though.  I wonder if that will be a good source now that you can put in so many more in a short time.</div></div><hr />

From my time with my lowbie BG alts, BG expierence isn't a &quot;fast way&quot; to level.  On Rock I do have banked 12 WSG/AB tokens for a quick kick of xp when the expansion hits ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">09-19-2006, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rumors are, when the expansion hits, repeatable hand-ins will no longer provide xp, but instead, they will receive gold. Kinda like how the non-repeatable quests give money now at level 60. It makes sense, because I had over 30 AQ40 tokens stockpiled. Each one gives like 6K xp. Players could insta-level when the expansion comes out, and I don't think Blizzard wants that. I'm sure there are some info about it on the official forums.<br />

Unless our talent trees get a complete overhaul, at least in the new talents, I don't forsee myself playing any other build than feral..  though I've tried resto and moonkin for a while.</div></div><hr />

No respec for me (am lucky enough to be in a guild which doesn't require you to be resto to raid - still heal most of the time, but that is beside the point hehe). That sounds like a plan and a half to me Trixtaa, hadn't thought of that but will definatley be doing that now.</div></div><hr />

I dont feel like spending 20 mins finding a mob that isnt already farmed by the 6,000 Horde in the Outlands, nor do I feel like PvPing when I do find a mob but with 10 Alliance around since its all PvP territory there.<br />
<br />
I foresee it much like the opening of Naxx, where there were well over a hundred people at LHC and no one got much of anything done with all the ganking going on. Oh...and Ill be feral :)<br />
<br />
Gonna be tough to give up my Warlord gear Ill be getting this next month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiskrens</div><div class="date">01-04-2007, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just doing some simple runs on beta shows that killing level 60 mobs yields 500-ish XP (I'm rested, so the amount displayed is ~1000), and the general quest reward seems to be ~10k at level 60. Plus there are a lot of quests, so Blizz seems to have given us some helping hand in how to level :). But level 61 requires 500k, so it'll take some time to complete anyway.<br />
<br />
And Warlord's gear can be kept a while; it seems to be valid  a few levels above 60 from what I've seen. I haven't replaced my T1 yet, but I've found a green pair of pants that were on level with my purple's.</div></div><hr />
