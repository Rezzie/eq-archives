<br />
My first ever 10 man Naax.<br />
<br />
And it looks like i'll be doing dps so i'm trying to cobble together a set of gear with enough hit ! :p  Never bothered with hit yet.<br />
<br />
We have 3 healers signed up so that's great for me :)<br />
<br />
No idea how far we are likely to get....say in 3 hrs ?<br />
<br />
We shall see......</div></div><hr />

<br />
i now have 2 new achievements for doing 2 of the 4 wings of naax.<br />
<br />
Plague and Spider.<br />
<br />
I was surprised how easy it was but I guess we are actually very well geared for Naax 10 given the low level of loot u get.<br />
<br />
Only a pug shammy who came at the last mintue needed anything !</div></div><hr />

<br />
only problem is having never raided i dont have hit.<br />
<br />
only had 179 swapping around some gear and using a blue trinket that i think comes from VH ? Mark of the War Prisoner.<br />
<br />
where does oomkin hit come from ?  raid tier gear i dont have ?<br />
<br />
should i gem or enchant for hit ?  always felt that was a waste but .....<br />
<br />
only problem boss is Heigan that you have to run around from the lava type stuff ! lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's all that come to mind immediately.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of items with large amounts of +Hit, like the Mark of the War Prisoner you already have.  I think they are meant to be a temporary crutch to fill in the gaps of +Hit until you get higher level gear with more hit on each piece.<br />
<br />
And grats on the dps - 3k is very respectable.  <br />
<br />
Gotta love the Heigan dance!</div></div><hr />

Talent into the Balance tree: improved fairy fire (up to +3%) and balance of power (up to 4%).<br />
<br />
So a moonking with improver fairy fire and balance of power maxed will need an + 263 to hit to have the max % to hit a level 83 boss that you have debuffed with fairy fire (if you are grouped with a dreani with heroic presence (+1%), you will need 237).<br />
<br />
The + to hit need to be maxed, you need it maxed for raiding, but like defense once at the cap and for as long you are at or passed the cap, it worth nothing.<br />

<br />
I'm horde so no Draenei.<br />
<br />
Raging - so would you recommend using the Elixir and not a flask to make up the hit that i lack ?<br />
<br />
The problem i have Raging is i will not be getting higher level gear will i (with hit) from 10 man Naax ?  Everything i have seen to date is ilvl 200.  The only thing i need to know is the tier gear that drops and set bonsues or if it has any hit on.<br />
<br />
However i am going to look at the items i can get with Valour emblems as I understand i can swap my new shiny EoC for EoV ?<br />
<br />
Can i get tier items from EoV ? i assume so.....maybe they have hit !<br />
<br />
I run with a reasonable set of gear for the game dungeons i actually enter.  Until 10 days ago i'd never seen a 10 man instance having given up raiding when 40 mans were in vogue, running BWL/AQ40 and MC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok a quick update on my last nights of raiding.....<br />
<br />
Sunday evening we did 2 wings and i got 2 achievements......Plague and Spider.  The 2 easiest and quickest i gather. I think we did both in about 2 hrs. Tbh i was surprised how easy it was. we 1 shotted every boss.<br />
<br />
Last night we spent almost 3.5 hrs in the Construct and Military.  A little harder - more deaths but no wipes on normal bosses. To be honest i think we are a good geared grp. I am sure it would have been a lot harder running this a while when it was newer with a lower level of gear.<br />
<br />
The only problems we had were on Sapphiron - 2 wipes (3 possibly?)  before we killed him.  Again remember that some of us have never been there before.  We use vent with most people on it listening to tactics.<br />
<br />
I did get a couple of loot items from the run but more to see if they are better than what i have now for certain situations.....ie a neck with some haste and spirit i need to look at using for healing when hit is not an issue.<br />
<br />
Onto Kel tonite !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">08-25-2009, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats on clearing up to Sapph - KT is a lot of fun too!<br />
<br />
It'd be hard for me to say if the hit from an elixir would be worth more than the benefits of a flask for you.  My only balance experience is &lt; lvl 50.  You'd have to consider the things flasks can give you - your mana longevity, spell power, etc - vs having that hit.  As a gut instinct, I'd say that if you have a noticeable miss rate, then the hit would be good for your dps.<br />
<br />
I know for kitty they say that on bosses, hit is extremely important (almost as much as Agi or Str) until you get up to the mid 200s, if not actually capped. <br />
<br />
I assume it's similar for boomkin but substitute Int/Spi for Agi/Str.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes, the T7 set  (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=800#comments)has a little (65), 36 on the helm and 29 on the shoulders.  So it doesn't look like there's a lot of help there, and you'll get more hit from other pieces.  I hear that the set bonuses are nice, but not earth-shattering.<br />
<br />
Sapph and KT drop gear ilvl &gt; 200 if I recall correctly, but regardless of ilvl, there are pieces with juicy amounts of hit that could drop from the wings of Naxx.  And OS, and VoA.<br />
<br />
I set up WoWHead searchs for +hit items that drop from regular Naxx, VoA and OS, ranked by their Balance Druid item weight scale, but couldn't find how to filter out the 25man items.  At any rate, it gives a good summary of what's available in there.<br />
<br />
Naxx (http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=ub=11;cr=105:119;crs=3456:1;crv=0:20;gm=3;w  t=119:103:123:96:23:61:24:77;wtv=100:46:46:43:26:1  5:8:-100#0-10-22+1)<br />
Obsidian Sanctum (http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=ub=11;cr=105;crs=4493;crv=0;gm=3;wt=119:103  :123:96:23:61:24:77;wtv=100:46:46:43:26:15:8:-100) - although there's only one ring with Hit on it.<br />
Vault of Archavon (http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=ub=11;cr=16:119;crs=4603:1;crv=0:20;gm=3;wt  =119:103:123:96:23:61:24:77;wtv=100:46:46:43:26:15  :8:-100) - but it doesn't distinguish between Archavon's drops and Emalon's drops.  Although now that I think about it, ilvl&lt;=213 would be Archavon, ilvl&gt;213 would be Emalon.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, HTH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed that starfire has a miss %age of 3.6%.  This did not sound a lot to me ?<br />
<br />
Yeah i am using the +125 sp flask otherwise.<br />
<br />
I will check out them lists.<br />
<br />
As for the T7 set you can get better now from the emblems of conquest ?  I have a conquerors head that has 60 hit on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
