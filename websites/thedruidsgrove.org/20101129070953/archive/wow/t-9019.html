The Horde was outnumbered 14-35.  I got sick of being pushed back so I quit being a caster and put on all of my feral gear.  I had like 2700 total mana, 5000+ hp as well as 8000+ armor in bear form.  I was out tanking paladins, and warriors, plowing through rogues, and destroying casters from the alliance with the help of my fellow Horde.  Im not even joking, at times I was being pummeled by at least 8-10 guys at once and withstanding everything.  We were taking out alliance one by one and pushing them back from graveyard to graveyard.  It was SICK.  Horde members started calling me &quot;Sir Bear&quot; and kept me healed while I plowed through everything the Alliance threw at us.  It was soooo awesome.  Druids are THE ****!</div></div><hr />

We could not have done it without teamwork.<br />
<br />
By the way, on Hyjal the horde is outnumbered 4:1.</div></div><hr />

And true you probally pwnd on your side of the bridge, but as soon as you got on it, it was over. And then after waiting on said bridge for like 2 hours, all your support left and you got bored and logged. AV sucks. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kow</div><div class="date">06-29-2005, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you win the AV battleground? I have spent upwards of 2 hours on that last bridge. In a raid using Timeless and Entropy (the 2 big horde guilds on Lightning's Blade) and been at a stand still. True you can fight all over the valley, rescue the mines, etc etc and its alot of fun. But when you launch your reavers and Ice guy at the same time, timeing the charges to match your rush from Stonehearth up the path, and get to the bridge and have Icey get stuck in evade and have your reavers get loopy and end up at the far graveyard AND have your entire raid force slaughterd before recovering 1 tower, it gets boring. Especially when it happens pretty much every night. As of now, I don't believe there is enough people doing AV on my server to make a horde team. CTF has taken over to replace boredom :(<br />

BTW its fun when you flop into bear and save a raid/run. Kudos!</div></div><hr />

We are outnumbered 4:1.  We spend the majority of our time at our last base fighting the alliance back until we get a surge and force them back a couple of graveyards.  usually by then they summon the giant tree and he ends up pusing us back to our camp.  <br />
<br />
Usually if we win AV, its because the biggest Horde guild Fires of Heaven enters the BG in mass.</div></div><hr />
