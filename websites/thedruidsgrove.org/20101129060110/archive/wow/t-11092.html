<br />
What are some of your favorite tricks?  These are pretty well known, but a couple of mine are:<br />
<br />
-popping out bear form, using nature's swiftness/Healing touch, rejuv, back to bear.<br />
<br />
-pop out bear, barkskin, regrowth, rejuv, bear form.<br />
<br />
-enrage, frenzied regeneration<br />
<br />
-while trying to escape a melee or pet, pop into bear, enrage, bash, run away again.<br />
<br />
-natures swiftness --&gt; roots<br />
<br />
-in WSG, pop free action potion, grab flag, go kitty, dash, pop out, rejuv, cheetah (or bear if you're taking damage)<br />
<br />
These are very basic, and most of them are simply knowing your class.  So if you have other tricks, please post em!</div></div><hr />

Its an instant cast spell that will basically shed any person or pet off you and give you room to heal. <br />
<br />
My favorite is when Im feral to pounce, build quick combo points, pop out and hit Natures Grasp then rejuv. While they are rooted, I restealth and ravage, then drop a 5pt Ferocious Bite on them. At that point they are usually dead, and its pretty easy to finish them off.</div></div><hr />

They're usually in the back somewhere, surrounded by other enemy players. I have improved prowl, so I sneak up and try to kill them with a ravage. I quickly turn into a bear, then feral charge towards my team members... hoping they won't kill me while I run to safety. ;) When pushing to aid station, I stayed in caster form to heal the front line. That's about it, I think.<br />
<br />
For WSG, I don my ac gear, hit myself with a rejuv and barkskin, then I go grab the flag, and turn into a bear. If I make it out, I travel form until I near my base, then I dash in catform toward our flag (assuming it is there). If our flag is missing, and I have the flag, I hide in the lil room next to our flag room. I sit myself against the wall above the boxes, and sit down. The flag goes INTO the wall, and all you see is your head sticking out of the wall. The red tag above your head (seen by enemy) is hidden too.<br />

<br />
You wouldn't actually want to click off all targets, because if you did that you'd loose your combo points. I've done the ravage, run, restealth &amp; return for more ravaging trick quite alot and it's all around good times. I use it more for entertainment purposes than anything, always fun to crit-ravage someone when they're drinking, and then run away leaving them with a shred of health and confused as to why you ran off. Of course when they sit down again for that drink the answer becomes apparent. <br />
<br />
I'm an engineer, and I just heard that the ice reflector trinket will deflect hunter traps. I haven't tried it yet, but that will be so nice in WSG. If there's an ice trap laid down as there seems to be anytime you're up against a good team, pop your trinket and then go for the flag. The hunter will be encased in ice, and that's one less slow/snare you have to deal with on your way out of the room.<br />
<br />
Incase anyone else is as noobish as myself... so if you're in Alterec Valley, and you're with the offense group and you want to lay down some heals it can be hard to target the right people fast enough. Especially when you're pulling marshals or taking down the main guy. What you can do to help is go to your /who tab and click on raid. Left click on any warrior, and drag to your screen. Now you have 1 group that shows all the warriors in your raid. That has made it alot easier for me to lay down faster/better heals in AV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I differ that a little bit:<br />
<br />
Shift out of whatever form, barkskin, rejuvenation, regrowth, highest ranked healing touch, rejuvenation, shift back.<br />
<br />
The reason why I do that is... First, I get a rejuv working on me right away, which will tick while I'm still casting regrowth, possibly saving me. Two, I get the regrowth heal, and then that HoT. Next, I have enough barkskin time left to get that Healing Touch in, so why let the extra time go to waste when I could be uninterupted and practically heal all of my life? And then I just cast a final rejuvenation as the first one will be out by now, but regrowth is still going.<br />
<br />
It works pretty nicely for me. True, that leaves you without the armor of bear for a while longer, but it's never caused me to die.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you have combo points built up on someone, and click off them, and don't select anyone else (including yourself), when you click back on that opponent you will still have the combo points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">10-20-2006, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrong. If you stay clicked off them for more than 2 or 3 seconds you lose your combo points. Why do you think smart hunters feign death against combo building classes? Feign death makes you detarget them and if you arent quick, youll lose them.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is root them then get about 15 yards away, about 6 seconds, and you drop combat and can restealth.</div></div><hr />

That's a lot of wasted mana to cast regrowth, rejuv and high rank HT.  Especially considering that you will be shifting back in to whatever form you were in.  Probalby only last 1 shift with this strat.  I dueled my good friend, who's a 60 hunter in 5/8 T1 and a few other epics last night, and had to shift out like 5 times to heal myself before I beat him.  He finally ended up saying &quot;damn, how many times do I have to kill you&quot;.<br />
<br />
I typically fight in bear form, unless I can get the jump on a squishy.  I end up having to heal a bunch of times, and rotate between 'bash shift regrowth rejuv', and 'shift NS HT 11'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">10-20-2006, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I mean, I won't healing touch if I am at or above 30% life. I only use healing touch to get that large jump of a heal if I was very close to death or am taking a lot of damage. And sometimes I'll use a lower ranked healing touch. It's never significantly bothered me for mana, as I have a lot of it. Eh, I can't exactly explain it; I don't have a set routine. I just choose my actions as I go, dependant upon what I am fighting.<br />
<br />
Though, it has lasted more than one shift, definately. Not to mention, most opponents I face are kind of shut down the second I reheal to near-full life, with HoTs on me, as they tend to be low on life by that point, so I don't usually -need- to shift more than once.<br />
<br />
*shrugs* Everyone has their own playing style.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-23-2006, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feral charge is a great escape ability, especially in places like AV with lots of players.  Target someone on the back side of the fight and charge them to get away from targets on you.  Then pop into druid form and heal yourself before the people targetting you have time to catch you.<br />
<br />
Also be sure you never use a HoT when a shaman or priest is near or a cast time heal when a mage is near if you can avoid it.  This is especially important in 1v1 PvP where you should be running out of range of these classes and healing yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well a warrior charged me (or whatever their move is called), and I ended up rooting him underwater.  I swam away a bit while he was still rooted, shifted and renewed roots, and basically kept him there until he drowned, I never attacked him at all.  I bet he was pissed.</div></div><hr />
