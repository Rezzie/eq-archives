I was wondering after the change to the flare line what nukes/dots you guys use in the group game.  <br />
<br />
Sod T4 and T5.<br />
<br />
For Sod T5 I use 2 hotkeys:<br />
This ties up 5 spell slots with nukes/dots/debuffs.  In high dps groups I do not use hotkey 1 since it is a waste of mana.  I still have to cast some heals especially on names or multi-mob pulls.  The cleric merc just can't keep up in T5 without some help.  These hotkeys have the proper pauses etc.  <br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anyone does anything similar or if they have any input.  Thanks<br />
<br />
I have tried setups using 6 spell slots for 1 cast of the flare line.  I found chain casting the flare line is too much agro.<br />
<br />
Hotkey 1.<br />
1) Cast Hand of Ro<br />
2) Cast Sunsinge Rk. II<br />
<br />
Then I cast a heal and/or AA nuke<br />
<br />
Hotkey 2<br />
1) Cast Nature's Searing Wrath Rk. II<br />
2) Cast Summer Solstice II<br />
3) Cast Summer Solstice II<br />
<br />
Then if still alive cast heal/aa nuke/clicky nukes then: <br />
twist  Harvesting Inferno Rk. II and Summer Solstice II until dead.<br />
<br />
Any obvious improvements jump out?  <br />
I have max aa on dots and nuke crits.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
