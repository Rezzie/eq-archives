  <br />
 Long time lurker  here, from back in the Velious/Luclin days - played this last week/weekend and  have gone from 60.99 to 63. Unfortunately, when I came back, all of my gear was  missing including bank inventory and plat, and some of my AA points were rolled  back (from what I remember I had, even after accounting for refunded  points).<br />
  <br />
  With the AA  experience gain change where it's level adjusted, I'm wondering when is the best  time to level AA's? I'm killing frogs in the Plane of Storms and it's been  ridiculously amazing EXP - ~2 AA points per lessons (I log out after I kill the  frogs). I don't know if I should just grind out a few hundred AA's at this level  or if AA leveling will be similar at a higher level. I'm at about 150 AA's right  now, missing mental clarity, spell casting reinforcement, sta, regen, and so on. <br />
<br />
 As for gear, after  all my gear was missing a GM gave me a leg-up kit with Sylvan, so I just had  visible pieces. I've since filled them in with some of the newer zone drops,  and help from very kind strangers. I would now love some advice on both what to  camp and what to buy in the bazaar. Some of the cheap but nice items I've heard  mentioned here include Tainted Heartstone and Direwrought Mask, which I've both  bought. I think the main thing I am missing are some nice focus  items (lost Shawl 8 among some other things which makes me cry everytime I think about it).<br />
<br />
  <br />
 I'll see if I can  post a Magelo later this week.<br />
  <br />
 Thanks for any  help!</div></div><hr />
