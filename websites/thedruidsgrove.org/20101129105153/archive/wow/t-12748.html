I r usually a feral duriod, but last night was asked to spec resto to shore up our healers for the SSC raid.  (Came 3rd on healing meters... out of 8 healers.. awesomez! ^_^)<br />
<br />
I had a question about tranquililty I was hoping some of you leaf druids can answer; what's the maximum range someone can be from me, and still receive the healing from tranquility?<br />

Another question, if I may...<br />
The Improved Tranquility talent gives 100% threat reduction.<br />
The subtlety talent gives a further 20% reduction.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that Tranquility generates -20% aggro, and so actually functions as a type of permanent fade ?<br />
<br />

<br />
I suspect it's more like the Subtlety decrease is applied to the thread generated as the spell is cast, not your total existing threat.  So, if you have a 100% reduction of threat from Improved Tranquility, then no threat will be generated at the time of casting Tranquility and 20% of nothing is still nothing.<br />
<br />
But I like the way you think :-)  I'd love a fade for those 'Oh S#@)' moments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, I use it only if things go horribly awry, but I've used it nonetheless.<br />
<br />
I have my Improved Tranquility at the max, and I have never generated aggro from it.<br />
<br />
It's wonderful fun in a 5-man, and range-distance is usually never a problem.<br />
<br />
I use it very, very rarely in a 10-man because it is beneficial to your group only, and is a sad waste of mana.<br />
<br />
I've never used it in a 25-man instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grynyr</div><div class="date">07-25-2008, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually use it a LOT when i'm spec'd 61resto.  Due to 0 threat and the ability to heal 4 other people.<br />
<br />
Its awesome in heroics like Magistrar's Terrace where multiple people might be taking damage with those multi-pulls (and we rarely take CC to MgT).<br />
<br />
It's great in 10mans on many of the pulls in both Kara and ZA when you are in the tank group, AND on several bosses.<br />
<br />
In 25mans, it can help a lot in places like SSC and Hyjal where you have more than 2 tanks.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It's and awesome spell (and reminds me of my favorite WC3FT toon - Keeper of the Grove), but costs a TON of mana.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
...(side note... how cool to have starfall and tranquility at 80.  I loved having a priestess of the moon and keeper of the grove both at lv 6 in WC3FT casting tranq and starfire at the same time while my chimeras with acid breath and massive army of dryads archers and huntresses mopped things up)...</div></div><hr />

And I also used to play WC3:FT :D  I wasn't particularly good at it but one of my friends got to the top 50 in europe.. :O<br />
