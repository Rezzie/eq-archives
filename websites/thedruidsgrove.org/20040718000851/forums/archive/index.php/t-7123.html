I have to get creative on how to expand this community. Registration, might be the tool needed to do the job. I've been looking at other ways to get the board to do what I want. However all attempts failed as of now. Becoming a member is my one way around it.<br />
<br />
Registration is always free, and takes just afew minutes of your time. If Registration is to become needed to view area's of The Druids Grove. Doing it now while it's not required, will save my server alot of heartaches and crashes.<br />
<br />
Registration still isn't a requirement to view us. But, doing it will help us all in the long run.</div></div><hr />
