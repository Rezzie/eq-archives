Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls<br />
<br />
   Looming over the stark wastes of Northrend, Icecrown Citadel awaits<br />
   those who would see the Lich King and his Scourge brought low and<br />
   the threat they pose wiped from the face of Azeroth. The heroes who<br />
   venture within will face some of the greatest horrors yet seen. But<br />
   before you burst into the front gate of the citadel, an alternate<br />
   means of entry beckons. Journey through three separate wings of the<br />
   new five-player dungeon, Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls, and<br />
   follow Jaina Proudmoore or Sylvanas Windrunner into the Lich King's<br />
   domain.<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Throne<br />
<br />
   All across Northrend, many battles have been fought against the vile<br />
   Scourge. Countless lives have been lost since the Alliance and the<br />
   Horde first reached these frozen wastes, but the champions of<br />
   Azeroth continue to march forward -- and Icecrown Citadel, the<br />
   cornerstone of the Scourge's power and the home base of the Lich<br />
   King, is their final target. Tirion Fordring and the Argent Crusade<br />
   have forged an accord with Darion Mograine and the Knights of the<br />
   Ebon Blade to form the Ashen Verdict. This coalition's strongest<br />
   combatants, along with the champions of the Alliance and the Horde,<br />
   will lead the charge against the citadel. In the new Icecrown<br />
   Citadel raid dungeon, Azeroth's mightiest will face terrifying<br />
   challenges before ascending to the Frozen Throne, where the Lich<br />
   King and his runeblade, Frostmourne, await to deliver the heroes to<br />
   their deaths.... <br />
<br />
Cross-Realm Dungeon Finder<br />
<br />
   The Dungeon Finder is now available, providing players with quick<br />
   and easy access to five-player parties. This feature connects all<br />
   realms within a battlegroup using an advanced matchmaking system,<br />
   making it easier for players of all levels to find a dungeon group.<br />
   In addition, players can reap additional rewards through the Dungeon<br />
   Finder by choosing the Random option, which is available to both<br />
   pick-up and pre-formed groups. Check out the User Interface section<br />
   for more details.<br />
<br />
Getting Started and Quest Tracking<br />
<br />
   A number of changes have been made to World of Warcraft's<br />
   introductory experience, including updated character and class<br />
   information at the character-selection screen, more robust tooltips<br />
   with images, improved health and mana regeneration at lower levels,<br />
   and adjustments to various classes designed to make it easier for<br />
   players to get started. In addition, all-new quest-tracking features<br />
   have been added to assist players in finding objectives, including<br />
   new interface functionality in the quest log, the map (&quot;M&quot; key), and<br />
   the Objectives pane.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
-  Icecrown Citadel<br />
   Three separate 5-player dungeons – The Forge of Souls, Pit of Saron,<br />
   and Halls of Reflection – containing all new challenges and missions<br />
   of discovery, await players in normal and Heroic modes.<br />
   10- and 25-player challenges await players in Icecrown Citadel. Only<br />
   when all challenges have been overcome in the raid dungeon can<br />
   players unlock hard modes for individual bosses. For more<br />
   information on how the Icecrown Citadel raid content will be made<br />
   available, please visit our Dungeons &amp; Raids forum:<br />
   http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11126&amp;sid=1<br />
-  Character Creation: The descriptions for races, classes, and race/<br />
   class combinations have been improved to provide new players with a<br />
   better idea of the roles and advantages of each class and race.<br />
-  Dazed: Creatures attacking a player from behind can no longer cause<br />
   players level 1-5 to be dazed, and have a reduced chance to cause<br />
   players level 6-10 to be dazed.<br />
-  Knockbacks no longer dismount players. If on a flying mount, you<br />
   will be knocked back a short distance before being able to resume<br />
   flying.<br />
-  The existing /welcome emote now greets/welcomes targets (character<br />
   says “hello”), while the new /yw is for saying &quot;you're welcome.&quot;<br />
-  Many of the tail sweeps with knockback effects will no longer hit<br />
   players’ pets.<br />
-  Level 1 characters no longer start with food or water in their<br />
   inventory.<br />
-  Attack is now called Auto Attack. The tooltip has been changed to<br />
   reflect that the player will continue automatically attacking a<br />
   target.<br />
-  Meeting Stones: To use any Meeting Stone, it is only required that<br />
   the character’s minimum level be 15. There is no maximum character<br />
   level requirement for any Meeting Stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-09-2009, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Classes: General<br />
<br />
-  Area-of-Effect Damage Caps: We’ve redesigned the way area damage is<br />
   capped when hitting many targets. Instead of a hard cap on total<br />
   damage done, the game now caps the total damage done at a value<br />
   equal to the damage the spell would do if it hit 10 targets. In<br />
   other words, if a spell does 1000 damage to each target, it would<br />
   hit up to 10 targets for 1000 each, but with more than 10 targets,<br />
   each target would take 1000 damage divided by the number of targets.<br />
   20 targets would be hit for 500 damage each in that example.<br />
-  Attack: Level 1 druids, mages, priests, and warlocks will no longer<br />
   start with the Attack button placed on their action bars by default.<br />
-  Default Equipment: Starting weapons are now more uniform. Rogues now<br />
   start with a pair of daggers equipped. All other classes except<br />
   shamans start with a 2-handed weapon equipped and the required skill<br />
   already known. Shamans start with a 1-handed weapon and a shield, as<br />
   they benefit more from the shield than they would from a 2-handed<br />
   weapon.<br />
-  Glancing Blows: The mage, warlock, and priest classes no longer have<br />
   an increased chance for their melee attacks to be glancing blows;<br />
   and the damage penalty due to their glancing blows is the same as<br />
   for other classes.<br />
-  Health and Mana Regeneration: These regeneration rates have been<br />
   increased by up to 200% for low level characters. As a player’s<br />
   level increases, the regeneration rates gradually reduce, returning<br />
   to normal rates at level 15.<br />
-  Pet Resilience: All player pets now get 100% of their master’s<br />
   resilience.<br />
-  Spell Mana Costs: These costs have been reduced for almost all lower<br />
   level spell ranks. In general, if a spell decreased in cost with a<br />
   higher level rank in patch 3.2.0, that spell now has the decreased<br />
   cost at all ranks. In addition, spells learned before level 20 with<br />
   reduced cast times and/or durations have even further reduced mana<br />
   costs, proportionate to their reduction in cast time or damage.<br />
-  Taunt Diminishing Returns: We’ve revised the system for diminishing<br />
   returns on Taunt so that creatures do not become immune to Taunt<br />
   until after 5 Taunts have landed. The duration of the Taunt effect<br />
   will be reduced by 35% instead of 50% for each taunt landed. In<br />
   addition, most creatures in the world will not be affected by Taunt<br />
   diminishing returns at all. Creatures will only have Taunt<br />
   diminishing returns if they have been specifically flagged for that<br />
   behavior based on the design of a given encounter.<br />
<br />
Races: General<br />
<br />
-  Orc and troll shamans now have their own unique totem art.<br />
-  Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to<br />
   even out the amount of starting health on the various races. All<br />
   races start with a standardized level of stamina, except for orcs,<br />
   dwarves, and tauren who now start with 1 extra point of stamina. For<br />
   each class, bonuses and penalties to all attributes have been<br />
   adjusted so that each race has an equal attribute total.<br />
-  Will of the Forsaken now shares a 45-second cooldown with similar<br />
   effects, including the Medallion of the Horde, Titan-Forged runes,<br />
   Insignia of the Horde, etc.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
-  Arenas<br />
   All abilities that have base cooldowns of 10 minutes or longer<br />
   cannot be used in Arenas, down from 15 minutes.<br />
-  Battlegrounds<br />
   Battleground Experience: Battleground experience gained is now based<br />
   on the level of the player gaining experience, rather than the<br />
   highest possible player level in that Battleground.<br />
   All level 71-80 Battleground daily quests will now award 25 Arena<br />
   points in addition to their current rewards.<br />
-  Wintergrasp<br />
   You must now have the following ranks to build or pilot siege<br />
   vehicles:<br />
   Rank 2: Build/pilot Catapults.<br />
   Rank 3: Build/pilot Demolishers.<br />
   Rank 3: Build/pilot Siege Engines.<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
-  Naxxramas<br />
   Players no longer need to kill the final bosses in all four wings of<br />
   this dungeon in order to teleport to Sapphiron. Teleportation orbs<br />
   have been added to allow players access back and forth from<br />
   Sapphiron’s lair.<br />
-  Oculus<br />
   Azure Ring Guardians agro distance changed from 50 to 40 yards.<br />
   Many bosses and creatures have had their total health reduced.<br />
   Several bosses and creatures have had cooldowns on specific<br />
   abilities increased, effect durations reduced, and damage on some of<br />
   these abilities reduced.<br />
   Ring-Lord Conjurers and Sorceresses now hang out in packs of 4<br />
   instead of packs of 5.<br />
   Vehicle scaling on the drakes based on the rider’s item level has<br />
   been increased to make them more powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knights<br />
<br />
-  Army of the Dead: The cooldown on this ability has been reduced from<br />
   20 minutes to 10 minutes. Army Ghoul damage dropped by 50%. Cannot<br />
   be used in Arenas.<br />
-  Raise Ally: The cooldown on this ability has been reduced from 15<br />
   minutes to 10 minutes. Cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
-  Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle: There is now a 1-handed version of<br />
   this rune in addition to the current 2-handed rune.<br />
-  Rune Strike: Threat generated by this ability increased by<br />
   approximately 17%.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Unholy<br />
   Night of the Dead: Now reduces the damage your pet takes from<br />
   area-of-effect damage by 45/90%, but no longer applies to<br />
   area-of-effect damage caused by other players. In addition, this<br />
   talent now reduces the cooldown of Army of the Dead by 2/4 minutes,<br />
   down from 5/10 minutes.<br />
-  Scourge Strike: Redesigned. The base ability now deals 50% weapon<br />
   damage plus an additional amount as physical damage.  However, for<br />
   each disease the death knight has on the target, the target will<br />
   take additional shadow damage equal to 25% of the physical damage<br />
   done. <br />
-  Unholy Blight: This talent now deals only 10% of Death Coil damage<br />
   as a damage-over-time effect on the target.</div></div><hr />

   Eclipse: This effect will not activate again within 15 seconds of<br />
   either type of Eclipse effect firing, in addition to the existing<br />
   30-second cooldown for each type of Eclipse. In addition, Eclipse<br />
   now grants a 40% critical strike chance to Starfire and 40%<br />
   increased damage to Wrath, up from 30%.<br />
   Force of Nature: Health on the treants has been increased.<br />
-  Feral Combat<br />
   Predatory Strikes: The Predatory Swiftness buff from this talent now<br />
   has an 8-second duration.<br />
-  Restoration<br />
   Gift of the Earthmother: Redesigned. This talent now increases spell<br />
   haste by 2/4/6/8/10% and reduces the base global cooldown of<br />
   Lifebloom by 2/4/6/8/10% instead of its previous effects.<br />
-  Pets<br />

   area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to<br />

<br />

   Cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
-  Deterrence: Now also increases the chance for ranged attacks to miss<br />
   the hunter by 100% while under its effect.<br />
-  Misdirection: Redesigned. Instead of having finite charges, it now<br />
   begins a 4-second timer when the hunter using Misdirection performs<br />
   a threat-generating attack, during which all threat generated by the<br />
   hunter goes to the friendly target. In addition, multiple hunters<br />
   can now misdirect threat to the same friendly target simultaneously.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Beast Mastery<br />
   Intimidation: If the hunter’s pet is in melee range of its target,<br />
   the stun from Intimidation will now be applied immediately instead<br />
   of on the pet’s next swing or attack.<br />
-  Pets<br />
   Avoidance: This talent has been replaced by Culling the Herd. Hunter<br />
   pets now innately take 90% less damage from area-of-effect abilities<br />
   like all other class pets. This does not apply to area-of-effect<br />
   damage caused by other players.<br />
   Cower: Redesigned. This ability no longer affects threat, and<br />
   instead reduces damage taken by the pet by 40% for 6 seconds with a<br />
   45-second cooldown. While cowering, the pet’s movement speed is 50%<br />
   of normal speed. Cower now only has a single rank and is available<br />
   at pet level 20.<br />
   Culling the Herd: This pet talent has replaced the Avoidance talent<br />
   in the pet trees (Hunter pets now gain that benefit automatically<br />
   without expenditure of talent points).  Culling the Herd increases<br />
   pet and hunter damage by 1/2/3% for 10 seconds each time the pet<br />
   deals a critical strike with Claw, Bite, or Smack.<br />
   Demoralizing Screech: The attack power reduction from this ability<br />
   has been increased by 40%, equaling the maximum possible attack<br />
   power reduction from the abilities of other classes.<br />
   Improved Cower: Redesigned. This ability now reduces the movement<br />
   penalty of Cower by 50%/100%.<br />
-  Pet Leveling: Hunter pets now need only 5% of the experience a<br />
   player needs to level, down from 10%.<br />
   Venom Web Spray: Range increased from 20 yards to 30 yards.<br />
   Web: Range increased from 20 yards to 30 yards.<br />
   Wolverine Bite: This talent is now enabled when the pet lands a<br />
   critical strike rather than from the target dodging the pet’s<br />
   attacks. In addition, this talent no longer has a prerequisite.<br />
<br />
Mages<br />
<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Arcane<br />
   Arcane Empowerment: This talent now also grants 1/2/3% increased<br />
   damage done by the mage’s party or raid for 10 seconds after the<br />
   mage gets a critical strike with Arcane Explosion, Arcane Missiles,<br />
   Arcane Barrage, or Arcane Blast.  This effect is exclusive with<br />
   Ferocious Inspiration and Sanctified Retribution.<br />
-  Fire<br />
   Blast Wave: The mana cost of this talent has been significantly<br />
   reduced.<br />
   Burning Determination: The duration of interrupt immunity granted by<br />
   this talent is now 20 seconds.<br />
   Dragon’s Breath: The mana cost of this talent has been significantly<br />
   reduced.<br />
   Firestarter: When this talent is triggered, it makes the next<br />
   Flamestrike cost no mana in addition to being instant.<br />
   Improved Scorch: The debuff from this talent no longer stacks, and<br />
   instead can apply the full effect from a single cast of Scorch.<br />
-  Frost<br />
   Deep Freeze: This spell now deals a large amount of damage to<br />
   targets permanently immune to stuns. In addition, when this ability<br />
   deals damage it will no longer consume two charges of Fingers of<br />
   Frost for those mages with the Shatter talent.<br />
   Fingers of Frost: This talent now triggers immediately on casting a<br />
   spell rather than being delayed until the spell strikes the target.<br />
-  Pets<br />
   Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from<br />
   area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to<br />
   area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
   Water Elemental: Waterbolt mana cost reduced by 80%.<br />
<br />
Paladins<br />
<br />
-  Divine Intervention: This ability now also removes Exhaustion or<br />
   Sated from a target if the recipient is out of combat when the<br />
   effect ends. In addition, the cooldown on this ability has<br />
   been reduced from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. Cannot be used in<br />
   Arenas.<br />
-  Flash of Light: This spell no longer causes a heal-over-time effect<br />
   unless the player has the Infusion of Light talent.<br />
-  Lay on Hands: This ability will place Forbearance on the paladin if<br />
   used on his or herself. It will not place Forbearance on others.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Holy<br />
   Aura Mastery: This effect of this talent has been reduced in<br />
   duration to 6 seconds.<br />
   Infusion of Light: This talent now causes the paladin’s Flash of<br />
   Light spells to heal the target for 50/100% of the Flash of Light<br />
   healing amount over 12 seconds.<br />
-  Protection<br />
   Divine Guardian: This talent no longer increases the amount of<br />
   damage transferred to the paladin from Divine Sacrifice. Instead it<br />
   causes all raid and party members to take 10/20% reduced damage<br />
   while Divine Sacrifice is active. In addition, the duration has been<br />
   changed to 6 seconds, however the effect does not terminate when<br />
   Divine Sacrifice is removed before its full duration.<br />
   Divine Sacrifice: Redesigned. The effect of Divine Sacrifice is now<br />
   party-only and the maximum damage which can be transferred is now<br />
   limited to 40% of the paladin’s health multiplied by the number of<br />
   party members. In addition, the bug which allowed Divine Sacrifice<br />
   to sometimes persist despite reaching its maximum damage has been<br />
   fixed. Divine Sacrifice will now cancel as soon as its maximum<br />
   damage value is exceeded in all cases. Finally, damage which reduces<br />
   the paladin’s health below 20% now cancels the effect early.<br />
-  Retribution<br />
   Repentance: This crowd control effect will no longer break early<br />
   from the damage done by Righteous Vengeance.<br />
<br />
Priests<br />
<br />
-  Divine Hymn: The cooldown on this spell has been reduced to 8<br />
   minutes, down from 10 minutes.<br />
-  Power Word: Shield: This spell can now be cast on non-raid/party<br />
   friendly targets.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Shadow<br />
   Improved Devouring Plague: This spell now deals 10/20/30% of its<br />
   total periodic effect instantly, up from 5/10/15%.<br />
   Mind Flay: The range of this ability has been increased to 30 yards,<br />
   up from 20.<br />
   Shadowform: This talent also now causes Devouring Plague and<br />
   Vampiric Touch to benefit from haste. Both the period length and the<br />
   duration of these spells will be reduced by haste. In addition, the<br />
   mana cost has been reduced from 32% to 13% of base mana.<br />
   Vampiric Embrace: This ability is now provides a 30-minute buff that<br />
   cannot be dispelled, instead of a target debuff and only generates<br />
   healing for single-target shadow damage spells.<br />
-  Pet<br />
   Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pet takes from<br />
   area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to<br />
   area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
Rogues<br />
<br />
-  Deadly Poison: In addition to its existing effects, when a rogue<br />
   applies Deadly Poison to a target which has already reached the<br />
   maximum number of applications, this will also trigger the poison<br />
   which the rogue is using on his or her other weapon.<br />
-  Dual Wield: Rogues now know this ability upon logging into the game<br />
   at level 1.<br />
-  Stealth: This ability no longer has multiple ranks. While active,<br />
   the single rank of this ability (available at level 1) allows rogues<br />
   to move at 70% movement speed.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Assassination<br />
   Improved Poisons: Bonus chance to trigger Deadly Poison from this<br />
   talent increased.<br />
   Murder: This talent now provides a flat damage increase of 2/4%<br />
   against all targets, instead of only targets which do not appear in<br />
   Icecrown.<br />
-  Subtlety<br />
   Preparation: The cooldown on this ability has been reduced to 8<br />
   minutes, down from 10 minutes.<br />
   Filthy Tricks: The cooldown reduction this talent provides for<br />
   Preparation has been reduced to 1.5/3 minutes, down from 2.5/5<br />
   minutes.<br />
<br />
Shamans<br />
<br />
-  Earth Elemental Totem: The cooldown for this totem has been reduced<br />
   from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. Cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
-  Fire Elemental Totem: The cooldown for this totem has been reduced<br />
   from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. Cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
-  Fire Nova Totem: This totem has been replaced with a new spell, Fire<br />
   Nova, which is available at the same ranks as the old Fire Nova<br />
   Totem. Existing characters will automatically learn this new spell<br />
   in place of the totem. With a Fire Totem active, shamans will be<br />
   able to use Fire Nova (fire magic) to emit the same area-of-effect<br />
   damage as the old Fire Nova Totem from the active Fire Totem, not<br />
   consuming the totem in the process. Fire Nova will activate a<br />
   1.5-second global cooldown when used and has a 10-second spell<br />
   cooldown. The caster must be within 30 yards of the totem to use<br />
   this ability, but does not need to be within line of sight of the<br />
   totem.<br />
-  Reincarnation: The cooldown on this spell has been lowered from 60<br />
   minutes down to 30 minutes.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Elemental Combat<br />
   Elemental Mastery: This talent now increases spell haste by 15%<br />
   instead of critical strike chance while active.<br />
   Improved Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Improved Fire Nova. This talent<br />
   now provides an additional 10/20% damage to the spell and reduces<br />
   the cooldown by 2/4 seconds.<br />
-  Enhancement<br />
   Earth’s Grasp: This talent now also reduces the cooldown of the<br />
   Stoneclaw and Earthbind totems by 15/30%.<br />
-  Restoration<br />
   Improved Reincarnation: This talent now reduces the cooldown of<br />
   Reincarnation by 7/15 minutes, down from 10/20 minutes.<br />
   Reincarnation cannot be used in Arenas.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-09-2009, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">User Interface<br />
<br />
-  Many of the default Interface Options settings have been changed for<br />
   greater ease of use by new players. Existing players who create new<br />
   characters may want to review the Interface Options in the event<br />
   that the default settings feel different.<br />
-  Quest Tracking Feature<br />
-  Players can now track quest objectives on the map (‘M’ key).<br />
-  Quest Log<br />
   A Show Map button has been added to the Quest Log. Selecting a quest<br />
   and pressing this button will open the map for the zone in which the<br />
   quest objective is located displaying the associated area of<br />
   interest. Any other active quests in a player’s Quest Log for that<br />
   zone will also be displayed.<br />
-  Map<br />
   The map interface has been separated into four separate panes: a map<br />
   pane (left), a pane listing active quest names for the zone being<br />
   viewed (right), a pane listing the full quest text for any<br />
   highlighted quest (bottom left), and a pane listing the quest<br />
   rewards for any highlighted quest (bottom right).<br />
   All active quests listed in the right pane for the zone being viewed<br />
   on the map will be assigned a number. These numbers will be<br />
   displayed on the map according to the areas of interest for each<br />
   quest.<br />
   Highlighting a quest name in the right pane will highlight the<br />
   corresponding area of interest on the map in the left pane, show its<br />
   quest text in the lower left pane, and list the quest rewards in the<br />
   lower right pane.<br />
   Given that some quest objectives can be achieved in multiple<br />
   locations within a given zone, highlighting such a quest will<br />
   highlight an area of interest closest in proximity to the<br />
   character’s current location.<br />
   This feature can be disabled by un-checking the Show Quest<br />
   Objectives box in the bottom right corner of the new map interface,<br />
   restoring the map to its standard full-screen display.<br />
   Clicking on the arrow in the top right corner of the new map<br />
   interface will hide all but the map pane, bringing the map out of<br />
   full-screen mode and allowing players to leave it open while<br />
   navigating a zone or engaging in combat.<br />
-  Objectives Tracking<br />
   This frame has been improved to offer new functionality and can be<br />
   used with the new shrunken map option.<br />
   The Objectives frame is now docked below the mini-map next to the<br />
   right 2 action bars and will track up to 10 quests for a zone.<br />
   Numbers have been added next to each quest name and objective<br />
   corresponding with those areas of interest displayed on the map. <br />
   If a quest objective has been completed, the number will be replaced<br />
   with a yellow question mark symbol.<br />
   The arrow button in the top right corner of the Objectives frame can<br />
   be used to toggle between minimizing and maximizing the quest<br />
   objective display.<br />
-  Quest Difficulty Tracking<br />
   This feature is off by default and can be enabled in the Objectives<br />
   window from the Interface Options menu. Turning this feature on will<br />
   color-code all quest names displayed in the map interface according<br />
   to difficulty (grey, green, yellow, orange, and red).<br />
-  Dungeon Finder<br />
   This feature has replaced the Looking For Group tool and provides<br />
   all-new dungeon party creation functionality.<br />
   Players can join as individuals, as a full group, or a partial group<br />
   to look for additional party members.<br />
   Groups using this tool will be able to teleport directly to the<br />
   selected instance. Upon leaving the instance, players will be<br />
   returned to their original location. If any party member needs to<br />
   temporarily leave the instance for reagents or repairs, they will<br />
   have the option to teleport back to the instance.<br />
   Players can choose the Random Dungeon option. <br />
   The Heroic Wrath of the Lich King Daily Random Dungeon option will<br />
   award two Emblems of Frost no more than once a day.<br />
   The normal Wrath of the Lich King Daily Random Dungeon option will<br />
   award two Emblems of Triumph no more than once a day.<br />
   Continuing to complete Wrath of the Lich King Heroic instances using<br />
   the Daily Random Dungeon option will award players two additional<br />
   Emblems of Triumph each time. <br />
   Daily Heroic and normal dungeon quests have been removed. These<br />
   quests have been replaced with weekly raid quests (see the “Quests”<br />
   section for details).<br />
   Level-appropriate rewards will be offered to players who choose the<br />
   Random Dungeon option for pre-Wrath of the Lich King dungeons.<br />
   Players can be placed in a group for a random dungeon no more than<br />
   once every 15 minutes.<br />
   Random Dungeon rewards will be placed in each player’s inventory<br />
   automatically upon completion of the dungeon (final boss killed).<br />
   A pop-up notification will display any rewards earned through the<br />
   Dungeon Finder.<br />
   Instead of choosing a random dungeon, players can also choose<br />
   specific dungeons appropriate for their level range. Multiple<br />
   instances can be selected at one time. The feature no longer limits<br />
   the choice to look for only 3 dungeon groups at one time.<br />
   Pick-Up Groups<br />
   Cross-realm instances are now available and use an improved<br />
   matchmaking system to assist players in looking for additional party<br />
   members. As with Battlegrounds, the realms in each Battlegroup are<br />
   connected.<br />
   As part of the matchmaking system, some of the more difficult<br />
   dungeons will have a minimum gear requirement. Players also need to<br />
   meet the requirements for dungeons that require attunement, such as<br />
   keys or quests. If a player does not meet the requirements for a<br />
   particular dungeon, a lock icon will be displayed next to that<br />
   dungeon. Hovering over this icon will display the requirements which<br />
   have not been met.<br />
   Only conjured items and loot dropped in a dungeon for which other<br />
   party members are eligible can be traded between players from<br />
   different realms.<br />
   A Vote Kick feature will be available in the event a member of a<br />
   party is not performing to the expectations of the other members.<br />
   Players who leave the group prematurely are subject to a Deserter<br />
   debuff preventing them from using the Dungeon Finder for 15 minutes.<br />
   If an existing group loses a member, the leader will be asked if he<br />
   or she wants to continue the dungeon. Choosing to continue will<br />
   automatically place the group back into the Dungeon Finder queue.<br />
   A Player will not be placed in a group with people on his or her<br />
   Ignore list.<br />
   Players who take part in groups who have one or more members who<br />
   have been matched with them randomly from within the Dungeon Finder<br />
   will receive extra rewards, up to and including the coveted Perky<br />
   Pug non-combat pet. The more random players with whom one groups,<br />
   the faster the pet can be obtained.<br />
   The Need Before Greed loot system will be the unalterable default<br />
   looting system for pick-up groups in the Dungeon Finder and has been<br />
   updated.<br />
   Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in<br />
   three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee<br />
   will be unable to roll on spell power items, and classes are limited<br />
   to their dominant armor type (ex. paladins for plate). All items<br />
   will still be available via Greed rolls as well as the new<br />
   Disenchant option should no member be able to use the item.<br />
   Players will be able to roll on items with a required minimum level<br />
   higher than a player’s current level.<br />
-  Looking For Raid<br />
   There is a new Looking For Raid option available to players that can<br />
   be accessed via the Raid Information screen in the interface or by<br />
   typing “/LFR.”<br />
   Players will be able to browse the system manually for any other<br />
   players looking for a raid dungeon group.<br />
   While browsing LFR players may sort the list ascending or descending<br />
   by left-clicking the following headers: Name, Level, Class, Tank<br />
   Role, Healer Role, and Damage Role. The crown is the Leader Role<br />
   (representing a raid group with 2 or more people). Players can<br />
   left-click on this header to sort the list with groups at the top or<br />
   at the bottom.<br />
   Hovering over players listed in LFR will display their name, class,<br />
   level, roles and comments. Hovering over a raid/group will display<br />
   the leader’s name, the raid information (number of people in the<br />
   raid), comments, if there are any bosses dead (and which ones), and<br />
   if there are any friends from your Friends list or ignored players<br />
   from your Ignore list in the raid group.<br />
-  The Looking For Group chat channel has returned and can be accessed<br />
   in all major cities (similar to the Trade chat channel) without the<br />
   use of the Dungeon Finder interface.<br />
-  Players may only be queued or listed in one of the following systems<br />
   at a time: Dungeons, LFR, Battlegrounds, or Arenas.<br />
-  Ignore List: The amount of characters a person can ignore has been<br />
   increased to 50. In addition, players on other realms can be placed<br />
   on the Ignore list.<br />
-  Buffs and Debuffs: This is a new section added to Interface Options.<br />
   New option - Castable Debuffs: Enabling this will cause only debuffs<br />
   you have cast on an enemy target to appear.<br />
   New option - Consolidate Buffs: Enabling this adds a buff<br />
   consolidation box near the mini-map. Very short term buffs (e.g.<br />
   Replenishment) and very long term buffs (e.g. Prayer of Fortitude)<br />
   are filtered into the buff box. The icons are stacked here, but they<br />
   can still be seen by moving the mouse cursor over the buff box. Long<br />
   term buffs will move out of the box when they are about to expire.<br />
   Buffs such as important procs (e.g. Art of War, Maelstrom Weapon),<br />
   cooldowns (e.g. Bloodlust / Heroism, Combustion) or limited in range<br />
   (e.g. totems and paladin auras) are always displayed.<br />
-  Tutorial System: The tutorial pop-ups are now larger, contain<br />
   images, and better try to direct players to the relevant locations<br />
   or user interface elements on the screen. In addition, several new<br />
   tips have been added, while some existing tips will now appear at<br />
   more appropriate times for new players.<br />
-  Dungeon &amp; Raid Difficult Display: A group’s dungeon or raid<br />
   difficulty setting will now be displayed via an icon off of the<br />
   mini-map.<br />
-  Group Disenchanting Option: In addition to rolling Need or Greed<br />
   on items, players now have the option to elect for an item to be<br />
   disenchanted if an enchanter of the appropriate skill level is in<br />
   the group. Disenchant works exactly like Greed except if a player<br />
   wins the Greed roll, they will receive the disenchanted materials<br />
   instead. Players who choose Need will always win the item and will<br />
   always beat those that choose Greed or Disenchant.<br />
-  Lag Reports: Players can now report high latency or lag by accessing<br />
   the Help Request menu.<br />
-  Unit Nameplates<br />
   The range at which players can see unit nameplates has been<br />
   increased by 40 yards.<br />
   Unit nameplates are now subject to line-of-sight limitations in<br />
   certain situations (this does not pertain to objects like Arena<br />
   pillars or bridges).<br />
   Players can now adjust select unit nameplate display settings listed<br />
   below under Interface Options via the Names tab.<br />
   Friendly/enemy pet nameplates can be toggled.<br />
   Enemy totem nameplates can be toggled (friendly totem nameplates are<br />
   never displayed).<br />
   Players can choose whether or not unit nameplates overlap.<br />
   Unit nameplates for critters are never displayed.<br />
-  Non spell-based tracking now persists through logout.<br />
-  Any party member may mark targets (this does not apply to raid<br />
   groups).<br />
-  Players will be warned when their talents are reset due to a new<br />
   patch.<br />
-  “/Settitle” command has been added.<br />
-  Instant quest text is on by default.<br />
-  Tentative status added for calendar responses.<br />
-  Players below level 10 may not join raids.<br />
-  Ignore list expanded to 50 to match the friends list.<br />
-  Unit frames added for special encounters.<br />
-  Interface element added next to the mini-map to show what dungeon<br />
   you are in (ex: 10- and 25-player Heroic dungeons marked with a<br />
   skull).<br />
-  Experience earned for a quest will display in the Quest Rewards<br />
   section.<br />
-  Confirmation box added when buying stable slots.<br />
-  Macro Changes<br />
   Symbol “@” added as a synonym for “target=”. For example,<br />
   “/cast [@focus] Flash Heal”.<br />
   New macro conditionals: “vehicleui” (if the player has a vehicle UI)<br />
   and “unithasvehicleui” (if the target of the macro has a<br />
   vehicle UI).<br />
-  Addon Author Changes<br />
   “registerForClicks” added to xml buttons.<br />
   “MouseIsOver” has been converted to a “C” function for increased<br />
   efficiency (e.g. /dump PlayerFrame:IsMouseOver() ).<br />
   When an addon file is loaded, the addon name and an addon table are<br />
   passed to the file through ‘…’. The same addon table is passed to<br />
   every file loaded by a particular TOC file (example at the top of a<br />
   Lua file: “local addonName, addonTable = …;”.<br />
   “motionScriptsWhileDisabled” attribute added to buttons. This allows<br />
   “OnEnter” and “OnLeave” to fire while the button is disabled.<br />
   “GetFileHeight()” and “GetFileWidth()” added to Texture objects. 0<br />
   is returned if no texture file is associated with the texture.<br />
   You can now query for a list of completed quests with\<br />
   “QueryQuestsCompleted()” then wait for the “QUEST_QUERY_COMPLETE”<br />
   event, and call “GetQuestsCompleted(&lt;luatable&gt;)”.<br />

Graphics<br />
<br />
-  A new feature has been added to the D3D graphics engine to improve<br />
   texture management (particularly for Windows XP users). If you are<br />
   experiencing random crashes related to file read errors or out of<br />
   memory, this new backend may help.  To enable the new backend, add<br />
   the following line to your Config.WTF file: SET gxApi &quot;d3d9ex&quot;. For<br />

Professions<br />
<br />
-  Enchanting<br />
   Enchant Weapon - Black Magic: This enchantment now sometimes<br />
   increases haste rating for the caster rather than inflicting the<br />
   caster’s target with a damage-over-time effect. It is also now<br />
   triggered by landing any harmful spell rather than inflicting damage<br />
   with a spell.<br />
   Enchant Weapon - Unholy: This enchantment now inflicts Shadow damage<br />
   in addition to its original effect.<br />
-  First Aid<br />
   The training costs for most bandages have been reduced.<br />
-  Fishing<br />
   The all-new Kalu’ak Fishing Derby, a test of fishing skill with a<br />
   healthy dash of luck, has come to Northrend! Every Wednesday<br />
   beginning at 8 PM players can try to catch the elusive Blacktip<br />
   Shark. Elder Clearwater sits in Dalaran for one hour awaiting the<br />
   return of the quickest, most experienced fisher to bring him this<br />
   shark. This champion fisher will be rewarded in-kind for returning<br />
   with the first catch. Those who aren’t able to return with the first<br />
   catch will still receive just reward for getting the Blacktip Shark<br />
   to Elder Clearwater before he takes his leave. It is said that these<br />
   sharks’ favorite meal are the bite-sized Pygmy Suckerfish. Perhaps a<br />
   hook in their waters will do the trick.<br />
-  Mining<br />
   Enchanted Thorium: This ability now uses the Mining skill and is<br />
   learned from trainers at a skill level of 250.<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
   <br />

   Crusader, or Icecrown Citadel.<br />
-  For the various Icecrown Bomber quests at Aldur'thar: The Desolation<br />

   characters not riding Wyrmrest Defenders.<br />

   the Lich King factions can be purchased with Emblems of Triumph in<br />
   Dalaran.<br />

   Basin, and Alterac Valley factions have been removed from their<br />
   respective “Master of” Meta-Achievements. Special titles will be<br />
   offered to those who reach exalted with these factions.<br />
   “The Party’s Over” has been removed from Achievements and is no<br />
   longer a part of the “Glory of the Hero” Meta-Achievement.<br />
   “Master Angler of Stranglethorn” has been changed to “Master Angler<br />

-  Arena Set Bonuses: The two-piece set bonus for all Wrath of the Lich<br />
   King Arena sets now provides 100 resilience and 29 spell power or 50<br />
   attack power. The current four-piece bonus will remain, however it<br />
   also now provides 88 spell power or 150 attack power.<br />
-  Death Knight Tier-9 4-Piece Bonus (Damage-Dealing): This set bonus<br />
   no longer grants Frost Fever a chance to be a critical strike. It<br />
   still grants that possibility to Blood Plague.<br />

   Glyph of Icy Touch: Instead of granting additional runic power, this<br />
   glyph now causes Frost Fever to deal 20% additional damage.<br />

   Glyph of Rapid Rejuvenation: This glyph allows for the druid’s haste<br />
   to reduce the time between the periodic healing effects of<br />

   Elemental to last indefinitely, but it can no longer cast Freeze.<br />

   Glyph of Mind Flay: This glyph now increases the damage done by Mind<br />
   Flay by 10% when the target is afflicted with Shadow Word: Pain.<br />

   longer drop from their associated rare creatures. Instead, there are<br />
   now rare nests that spawn which contain these hatchlings. For<br />
   example, the Leaping Hatchling can now be found in Takk’s Nest<br />
   rather than as a drop from Takk the Leaper.<br />
-  Icecrown Citadel Items: Normal and Heroic versions of Icecrown<br />
   Citadel rings and trinkets are considered Unique-Equipped and cannot<br />
   be used at the same time.<br />

   item can now be sold or disenchanted as normal.<br />
-  Shaman Tier-9 4-Piece Set Bonus (Elemental): This set bonus now does<br />
   an additional 10% of Lava Burst’s initial damage over time instead<br />
   of increasing the size of the Lava Burst.<br />

   Ancient Pickled Egg: This item can no longer be triggered by Life<br />
   Tap.<br />

   previously were cancelled by getting on a mount will now cause an<br />
