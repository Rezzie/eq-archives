Unless you have done lots of LDONs, I would go get the slipgear aug and replace the LDON one.  I've done and helped several ppl thru all but the Hive and they are really safe and easy.  Huge upgrade for me.  Also, unless your charm has stats on it, I would look for something else.  I bought a Tainted Heartstone for 600-800pp in the bazaar and spent 30 mins in the guildhall with a guildie spamming at me to max my languages.<br />
<br />
If LDON aug has lots of upgrades, do a few DoN missions and buy a Charm that has 2 aug slots.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out for special events.  The Halloween and New Years events had nice upgrades for me.<br />
<br />
Don't laugh too hard and ignore the stats on the charm, I don't have it set right.<br />

Oh, my neckpiece is the common drop from the Fairy MM in Nektulos.  Looks like it may be an upgrade for you.  Earring and boots are from MM's too.</div></div><hr />
