Tough to gear up in this case...  I have a good number of empty aug slots, but dont see the value in filling them up with +6 stat or resist augs...<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on obvious replacements?  I am guessing the answer is simply &quot;get to DoD&quot;, but there might be something out there that some smart person is aware of, that I'm not...<br />
<br />
Any advice gratefully appreciated.<br />

They're great for the clicky, but if you're looking for stats I'd recommend the DoN or Omens tier 1 armor quest (which you already have the boots for).  Otherwise, Icedrop Pearl (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70327) is a random zone drop in Riftseekers.  From the look of it, your gear is pretty good and you have most of the foci that will be useful to ya.  For a non-raider and except for the items above, you'd prolly need DoD mission loot to improve your gear significantly, or find a decent off-hours raiding guild (there's a few here and there).</div></div><hr />

Could make something of that effect with a little pp.<br />
 <br />
--<br />
 <br />
Mpg trials? rifts? Dodh missions?  Depending on 'what' you do in those zones it may be that hard.  Just round up whoever and go at it.<br />

You might want to look around to see what macroquesters err multiboxers are farming Msha`s in qvic on your server and see if there's anyway you can get something from them.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because all Msha farmers are evil, heartless bastards who use macroquest to box seriously gimp and easy to pull with a bard, not to mention they are just autoattack, /melody +chain CH (if that) content. :rolleyes: (plus with a decent bard you can get the mshas with only clearing 2-3 mobs...yes dvoin and mnat along with ptav.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Undershore has a couple easy named that drop a regen 2 aug and a ft 1 aug.<br />
<br />
The first 68 dod spell progression task can basically be soloed if you could find a couple other people willing to group with you to get it.  The drop is a mask thats slightly better than the halloween mask.<br />
<br />
As mentioned there are some oow player made augs that are very nice, might be more pp cost than you want tho.<br />

 <br />
Belt:  Belt of Efficentcy - MPG Trial - Efficency<br />
Shield:  Bane of the Stonegazer - MPG Trial - Ingenuity / 69.1 Hard Chest Loot<br />
Shoulders:  The Ones from Destruction, forget the name, MPG Trial - Destruction<br />
Earring:  Earring from Subversion, MPG Trial - Subversion<br />
Back Item: 69.2 Hard, Cloak from Weaponary Trial - MPG Weaponary, 68.3<br />
Face:  70.5 Easy, 69.1 Hard, Resist Clicky Mask, Fear Mask - MPG Trial - Fear<br />
Ring:  Weaponary Ring - MPG Trial - Weaponary<br />
 <br />
Augs:  60/60 Augs from: <br />
The Nest<br />
Splitpaw - Quested<br />
Unrest - Mission<br />
The Entire 69 Spell Mission series on Easy results in various augs.<br />
 BIC Augs<br />
 <br />
I know that I wasn't totally clear on the names of the items, but they are th eonly items which drop from those missions you can use =p  Any DoD Mission referanced with Level . X  is the caster reward result.<br />
 <br />
The Shield form 69.1 Hard, is Blood Defender, iirc<br />
 <br />
All of the mentioned upgrades would probly give you around 1k more mana, if not just under, as well as cap your ft.<br />
 <br />
Good Luck<br />

You can get the high plat materials for making them from DoN missions and while you're at it farm the crystals for auging the gear out, or for selling to purchase items for other slots either from DoN merchants or bazaar.<br />
<br />
Properly augged Cultural gear can be better than time gear or at least on par in alot of cases.</div></div><hr />

With Last Blood augments, it can be better than most raid gear up through anguish, but you need to be in a demiplane raiding guild to get the key part of those and they take a LOT of work to make. =/</div></div><hr />
