Which best fits the way you group with your Druid?<br />

I am almost always main healer in groups I am in.<br />
Sometimes I am main healer, sometimes I dps in the groups I am in.<br />
I am almost always dps in the groups I am in.<br />
I do not group with my Druid.</div></div><hr />

I am MH alot, but I also get to be DPS some also.  Yes I miss the new DoTs we were supposed to get.  I wish we'd get the debuffs that have been being discussed.  As of now, I almost always hit the mob with HoR, if its going to be a long fight I use SC and fixation.  AS has worked out well for me, it procs pretty often.  Skin to Vines is only semi useful, I dont keep it memed very often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">10-23-2006, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main group typically has a cleric, shaman, and myself, healing and slowing and debuffing on a warrior or SK, with a enchanter handling CC, and some DPS class hammering the mob. I get to Debuff, DPS and Backup Heal.<br />
 <br />
If we dont have the cleric, I will typically be MH and debuff Attack with the shammy slowing and throwing HoT's. If we don't have a shammy, I am debuffing, patch healing, and tossing nukes.<br />
 <br />
If we don't have a Enchanter, I am Crowd Control, snaring and rooting, and assisting with splitting pulls. All in all, I have a wonderful life. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No matter what the situation is, a druid should be conscious of healing, damage, and utility aspects of play.  The 'role' you need to play should dictact what aspect(s) you concentrate more on, and you should be aware of how your role changes while the situation you're in changes (ie, if cleric dies) -- but there is no situation where you should completely unconscious of any aspect of play.<br />
<br />
A dead mob or a mob running mob does zero damage, so zero healing is required.  Quicker kills give quicker XP.  Quicker kills means the mob has less time to deal damage to the tank which means the tank will require less heals.  Is it mana efficient to sit there chain nuking instead of medding between heals? No, it isn't.  But if you find the right balance of what you need to do better overall results will be produced.<br />
<br />
Basically, I hate inflexible druids who put themself in 'roles.'  /hate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gweedru</div><div class="date">10-27-2006, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids are and have always been the swing player.  Even when i'm main healer in a group, i still throw in a nuke or two, debuff, snare the mob if it runs, throw Reptile on the tank, etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It all depends on how much you're relied on for healing as to what else you can do in a group.  If blessed with a beefy tank, i can usually get away with healing once at the end of each mob, and then nuking or dotting to do some damage in between.<br />
<br />
As was said above, rarely am i ever forced to ONLY heal or only DPS.  If we are lucky enough to have a cleric, we just find a more challenging spot to exp in.<br />

<br />
The intent of the original poll was to show that Druids do play a variety of rolls and that a dps roll is common. I know many Druids play the way I do and the spell selection for TSS was a great disappointment to me. I stopped playing my Druid for months.<br />
<br />
I wanted the spell selection changed and I wanted SoE to see for themselves what Druids are really doing. I honestly don't feel SoE understands Druids very well.<br />
