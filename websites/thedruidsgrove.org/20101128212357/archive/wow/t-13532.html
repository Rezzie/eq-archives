Looks like the biggest difference is that you gem for pure Attack Power, where he gems for Agility?  That might be it.  It could be a rotation thing as well but I'm really, really bad with kitty stuff.  I'm a bear...or a tree...but I hope checking out his gear helps some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dude, nothing personal, but you're gemming for AP is making me a sad panda :(<br />
<br />
based on what they say at EJ, 1 agi = 2.2 AP PLUS, agi increases your chance to crit, and chance to dodge (which comes in really handy on mob pulls when you inevitably draw aggro and don't like to use your cower button)<br />
<br />
if you're NOT at least 62% chance to crit, raid buffed, then you should be gemming/chanting agi all the way... onceyou get to 62% then you should be gemming ArPen... apparently (and i've just learned this from a new kitty that joined our guild and seeing HIS dps) even after the nerf to ArPen, it's still SICK on dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">02-11-2010, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get away with ~55-60% raid buffed crit if your ArP is high.  Pure agility stacking is pretty much win until you're at like 700 ArP.  Then just gem straight ArP.  <br />
<br />
I'm going to disagree on gemmign ArP once you hit 62% crit though.  Agility is still better until your ArP is at higher levels because ArP scales proportionally versus linearly.<br />
<br />
The more ArP you have the more value a 20 ArP gem is going to be.  So if you're at 64% crit and only for some reason have 200-400 ArP, just stay with Agi gemming.  The safe level to switch to pure ArP gemming is generally around 650+ ArP through gear.</div></div><hr />

Ive changed 4 of my 40ap gems to 20 agi gems and using blakend dragonfin as a food buff which gives 30agi for 1 hour do. Also scrol of agil which gives 20 agil for 20 mins. Could you let me know if i need to change all ap gems.? Thanxs in advance....:)<br />
 Hopfully this will chear your panda up ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-13-2010, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">your ArPen is listed as 465, reducing your enemies' armor by 33.22%<br />
<br />
with the stats you listed as unbuffed, my personal choice would be to gem ArPen all the way... <br />
<br />
i checked out your spec and glyphs, and you're ok there... can you tell us what type of &quot;rotation&quot; (i use that word loosely, for the obvious reasons) you're using? What are, say, your first 6-8 moves? and, (i have to ask) are you keeping SR up?<br />
<br />
*edit* i checked your ArPen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaara</div><div class="date">02-13-2010, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive bean useing facemauler addon and only using sr when it came up. Which are mangle, sr, rake, shred, mangle, rip, sr, It was recomended buy a kitty in my old guild that had crazy dps he said he used facemauler to help him... Shal i replace only 40 ap gem with arpen gems or all ap gems. <br />
 Thanxs for quick reply by the way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">02-14-2010, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should really never gem attack power.  Just gem ArP.  Or agility.<br />
<br />
If you're going to gem straight ArP by the way, find more ArP gear.  Gemming pure ArP is still going to only bring you up to about 550-ish.  Ideally you want to hit soft cap with some sort of ArP trinket proc.  That's around...1300?  So basically like NES procs for 600-ish ArP, you want to aim for around 650 ArP with gear.   Maybe replace your Dalaran ring with the triumph badge DPS ring.  <br />
<br />
The Herkumi War Token is not a really good trinket for DPS either.  You'd be better off farming Heroic Forge of Souls for the Needle Encrusted Scorpion.<br />
<br />
Also if you're in t10 content, I'd go for my 2pt10 first.  The 2pt10 bonus is pretty awesome-sauce.   Looking at your gear though 5.5-6k shouldn't be too hard if you smooth out your rotation.</div></div><hr />
