I got the first fragment within about 10 minutes of foraging, and I've been foraging for the second for the last week.  I've spent about 30 hours in Barindu and Ferubi trying to forage this second fragment, with no luck yet.  I petitioned it to a GM, thinking maybe it was broken, and they said that last they'd heard it was working fine.  Has anyone else had this problem or anything like it?</div></div><hr />

Also, there might be code in place that you cannot forage the same rune fragment twice as long as you have one (a kind of hidden &quot;lore to forage&quot; flag).  The rune fragments come from different zones, so you might try moving if you haven't. Might just be very unlucky as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gillighan</div><div class="date">04-02-2006, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I've tried moving around, different areas of both zones; I foraged the first one in Barindu and I've spent about 20 of my 30 hours foraging in Ferubi.  I've also tried having the first fragment in the bank, in an inventory bag, and in the actual container for them.  I also get a &quot;Duplicate Lore items are not allowed&quot; message in both zones, so I know that the first fragment can come from either zone, but still no second one. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Like, Rune A drops from zones a and b, and rune b drops from zones c and d.  It's been a long time since I did this so I can't remember which zones dropped which runes &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I had a bot once, for foraging something like Tea Leaf Oil, sitting in Natimbi and Qinimi and Barindu over like two weeks. I got my stuff foraged and when I was running back to Natimbi magus, I hit forage again and then I got the first rune fragment of all that time. So, it's just rare.<br />

I got these for my own epic while doing BiC and having forage keyed to right turn.</div></div><hr />

They can both be foraged in either ferubi or barindu.  Can take awhile to get them though.</div></div><hr />

Definitely is not code to not forage the same rune twice.  I got 8 lore messages before I got the other fragment.  Got both in Barindu too.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't working on it at the time but happened to forge it just passing through Ferubi. Later when I decided to start 2.0 I went to Ferubi and it took about 15 min to get the second. So it's all just chance.</div></div><hr />

Guess I was just REALLY unlucky.  Oh well, thanks for all the input everyone!</div></div><hr />
