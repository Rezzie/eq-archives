<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xilxen</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all.  Long time reader, first time poster.  My main is a lvl 65 with about 100 aa's, and I am embarrassed to admit I've been in the dark all this time regarding the druid wooden figurine charm and the adventurer's stone.  I have the stone but have some questions please.<br />
<br />
1) Currently my adventurer's stone is attached to a low level charm.  Can you detach the stone in the camp fountain?  If not, can you get a new stone if the old one is destroyed?<br />
<br />
2) When I acquire the wooden charm will its stats automatically update due to all of my PoP keys?  If the charm is destoyed can you redo the quest to get another one?<br />
<br />
3) Regarding removing augs from items, where do you purchase the distiller for removal?  I cannot recall seeing it sold from camp vendors.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any other good info on the charm and stone.  I'm sorry for the newbie questions but I just never paid attention to this and I can't find a good post on the topic.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. :)</div></div><hr />

You get a new adventurer's stone for free, distillers have a cost based on the type of distiller needed (from a few PP to over 1K PP).<br />
<br />
The stats on the wooden charm reflect the current state of your pop progression flags.  You can get the charm at any time or destroy and get a new charm without changing the stats on the charm.  Note that the charm stats are based on pop-progression and not on zone access due to level or the alternate access quests.</div></div><hr />
