1. are they ever going to add in more fist weapons, and make them like the rest of the weapons some player made and some dropped.  I would love to sport a big Paladin shredding Claw of the eagle in my main hand--hehe<br />
<br />
2. What about a woodworking profession? any news on that? it might not be too helpfull for a Druid(unless you could make some kind of cool living wooden armor) but it would be a cool profession to have if you alraedy have an engineer/alchemis/leatherworker</div></div><hr />
