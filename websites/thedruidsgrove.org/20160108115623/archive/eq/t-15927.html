You're a druid?<br />
 <br />
I stopped playing PVP when I started raiding because there was no point anymore, everything I casted got resisted.<br />
 <br />
Assuming he's mezzing you with his Luclin song, I'd recommend dotting yourself with flame lick.<br />
 <br />
There's not a lot you can do in EQ to prevent being debuffed, since dispells are unresistable.  Recommend keeping insta-click buffs in your top slots.<br />
 <br />
It's been so long since I even bothered with PVP...</div></div><hr />

My SK remains undefeated in almost 3 years. MY druid, otoh, has never won one and they are similarly geared. Druid was my main for 2 years and I am quite good at root rot / quad kiting / normal kiting, etc. But you can't win if you can't get your nukes and dots to land, which is where druids are today against most duel challengers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amped</div><div class="date">06-02-2007, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With those two buffs you would be relying on people hittng you. As a dueling SK, I can just shadowstep around, lifetap you and HT you without ever swinging a weapon.  Now, if druid spells land... treat a PC just like a mob. Snare, root, dot, dot, dot, nuke, nuke, nuke. But like I said, the dots and nukes don't land on many PCs these days. And even if they land they don't do much damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitano</div><div class="date">06-04-2007, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont even bother memming snare and root .. NBW is the closest to a Finishing spell as we get .. using Immo / hor to debuff, and as many magic dots as i can land ... <br />
 <br />
and until i find a sk with a mana pool as big as mine .. I fear not lifetaps ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amped</div><div class="date">06-04-2007, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. My SK has a 12 K mana pool. I don't see a problem beating a druid, no offense intended. TBH, the only class that has ever given me trouble consistently is Paladins. And once they use LOH, it's all over for them too. BTW, by trouble, I don't mean i can't or don't beat them. I just mean it takes some time to do so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veresz</div><div class="date">06-08-2007, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Transfer to Zek...arena /duel pvp just isn´t the same (apologies if you are actually referring to a toon you may have on Zek).<br />
<br />
An SK who shadowsteps around and just lifetaps would be death by laughter only...SK´s are only to be feared by druids these days when it involves double DT fun.....<br />
<br />
As for bards, they have always been a right royal pain. Main hope is to ruin his game plan by getting dots/snare etc on him while you have the mana left. get him focussed on defending/pelling himself rather than attacking you. That said, they just run off at that stage anyway, so its a pointless fight.<br />
<br />
Not memming snare is just ridiculous. It´s about our best pvp weapon. Only one worth having for pvp (at least with resist system on Zek) is the 69 DoN Chromatic snare. NBW is a nice new pvp addition.<br />
<br />
My usual pvp lineup is pure life, serpent vines, reptile skin, HoR, Immo line, magic dot, fernspur, dispell, NBW.......obviously slight variations depending on class you fight.</div></div><hr />

never knew the DoN snare was the best pvp snare we had, ill have to start memming it~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarra</div><div class="date">01-10-2008, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Click your epic 1.0 on yourself.  That stops the charm for a good 3 minutes... that is your time frame for killing the bard.  You gotta cast it b4 you enter the PvP arena or youll resist it yourself.  Start off with NBW, and have Fernspur at the ready.  Bards are limited in self healing abilities, they will run around in circles singing their hot to get it back and clicking potions.  Load your 2-3 best MR dots, they land far better than any other spells we get.  NBW works fantastic even w/o HoR or Immo.  I dont even mem those 2.  I keep my casted DS's memmed, self buff, and single target DS.  They wont wanna meele you, but they really have no other option to kill you.  I constantly duel people with max resists and my MR dots land 3/4 of the times i cast them and NBW does partial nuke dmg atleast that often too, once its nuke lands the dot will tear them up.<br />
<br />
I hate dispellers but rather than useing your time to stop/fix their actions, just make them worry about what your doing to them.  Tear them apart, they take your buffs off, you take their hps off.<br />
<br />
Oh but that was all oldschool style, now you cant mez in PvP anymore even with ancients so ive herd.  Some bard and chanter were complaining about it to me.  But ive been mezzed by a 'rogue trap' that i wasnt ina duel with or in the arena with.<br />
<br />
I hope ya kill um bro.  Toss me a tell and post a screenie of the bard corpse heh.  And id love the chance to duel that SK heh, i need another screenie for my folder.  PS any druid that retorts to kiting in an arena or useing snare makes Karana cry.  Toe to toe dueling zerkers is the only way they are any fun hehe.</div></div><hr />
