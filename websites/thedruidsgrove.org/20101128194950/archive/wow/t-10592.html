<br />
There's more about different server types in the druid guide:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, as Yrys said, its best to get in with a new or low pop server, cause then there will be a lot of people leveling and in the same boat as you.  If you get into a high pop server that has been around for a while, there will be a TON of 60's with epics, and a lot of them will have alts.  You will probably be leveling with these alts, and playing against peoples alts in the bg's, and that takes a lot out of the game.  There is something to be said for exploring / learning the game with a new group of people who are devoted only to the character that they are playing with you.  And you wont get people saying mid Mara run &quot;sorry guys, have to go fill in on Ragnaros with guild.  peace&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what was mentioned above basically. If you play alone start out on a new / low population server of your choice. If you have buddies you know, join servers that they play on.<br />
<br />
Now the breakdown (or at least what I know about different types of servers). Mind you that I play on a PvP server and never really experienced other server types.<br />
<br />
Here are the different types:<br />
Normal / PvE: You can't get world pvp'ed unless you have your PvP flag on. Good for those who want a little bit of both worlds.<br />
PvP: You can get world pvp'ed or 'ganked' in every contested zone and in horde controlled, alliance can only attack horde if they are attacked first and vice versa. Pretty fun but soemtimes the 'ganking' can get annoying.<br />
RP: You have to 'play' or 'act' out a character from a particular storyline. Your character should have a name with a meaning and you are expected to be in character at all times. There is more info here @ the WoW website. <br />
RP-PvP Same thing as PvP but you still...Role play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but since you've changed your ways:  New Servers are always good, but picking a low-pop server can be a problem depending on your goals.  You may find there aren't many or any guilds that will be serious about high end content when you do get to 60.  Some people from my guild who transferred off to a low pop server are very frustrated by this situation presently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea. But you can be the person starting those guilds. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkelf</div><div class="date">05-17-2006, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys . Like I said I'm very good Guild master and I m realy good in picking players and different characted like druids , mages and so on . I wanna find some good guild ( serious one ) and play together every day . Maybe low population server is not bad idea but anyway I think I'll pick high one cause I need 2 months to get lvl 60 . Maybe this is funny to you but one of my friends was playing on blizzard and we are like big fanatics of this game . <br />
If anyone here play on some realm I will be glad to register at same and play with you . Thanks on comments .</div></div><hr />

<br />
The server I play on &quot;Lightbringer&quot; has to be a 486 running windows 3.1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkelf</div><div class="date">05-17-2006, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm thanks man I will accept your advice and do like you said .<br />
Is your realm good ? Maybe I can play with you later ?</div></div><hr />
