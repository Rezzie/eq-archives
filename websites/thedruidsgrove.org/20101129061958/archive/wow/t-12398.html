With a lot players now packing 300-400+ resilience, is there much point in investing in talents and gear that work off of crit rate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The massive amounts of Resilience out there right now pretty much stop anyone from critically hitting any regular-pvp player.<br />
<br />
I mean, if a Feral Drood only needs 103 Res to become uncrittable, 400+ makes anyone else the same.</div></div><hr />

That is only a pve thing.  If you look at your resiliance, it will tell you the reduction in chance to be crit (something like 10% at 400 resil).  Which means if a warrior in zerker coming at you has 30% to crit base, they will only crit you 20% of the time.</div></div><hr />

Thx!<br />
<br />
Offhand do you know if resiliance stacks with Survival of the Fittest and + Defense or is there a crit resist cap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The more resilience your opponent has, the more you will rely on raw attack power in my opinion.<br />
<br />
But hey, give it a shot and let us know how it works.<br />
<br />
I'd love to be proven wrong, that would make my set a bit easier to build.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I forget the exact math, but for a ballpark figure, you'd need resilience in the thousands to be uncrittable to a player with 40% crit chance. And that's just not possible with the available gear in-game.</div></div><hr />

I thought there was a limit that resilience could cut off the crit chance of about 12.5%. I don't know that not critting is the real problem anyway, it's the reduction in damage done to crits that makes a crit build not as viable as a pure damage one. Trouble is, crits do more than just provide extra damage, for cats they add combo points, bears they add rage and for both heal a bit of life back (with ILOTP), so discounting crit altogether would be a bit silly.</div></div><hr />

Technically ppl could be well over 500 (gemming with all +8 resil gems and getting all available resil enchants), maybe pushing 600, but its not worth it a) because there is a point where you gimp your overall dmg to increase resil too high, and b) after 490 something resil crit reduction is capped.<br />
<br />
I do agree with stacking AP for arenas, but don't gimp your crit rate, especially with a rogue.  Rogue / Feral can put out some ridiculous burst, and if even a single ravage / shred / mangle crits on the focus target the match could be over.</div></div><hr />
