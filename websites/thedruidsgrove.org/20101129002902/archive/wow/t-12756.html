I'm in the beta too :D  which server are you on? I'm on Northrend (PVE) my druid's name is Aemilia and my DK's name is Purelife. The DK is 59 and my Druid is almost 72. <br />
<br />
My current spec is 60/0/2 (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0xcrziIsAzhiuotZb) It's been amazing for soloing. I really really really like Owlkin Frenzy for solo play, but would highly doubt it would be included in any future raid builds. I also did The Nexus a few times and each time I had 2 other caster DPS who both said they loved Imp Moonkin.<br />
<br />
Not sure what else to say except that I'm loving the new changes :D</div></div><hr />

I'm on Northrend as Feralstar.  (I hate the rename thing).  Of course I'm feral and not much help to the DPS discussion of Boomkin here....</div></div><hr />
