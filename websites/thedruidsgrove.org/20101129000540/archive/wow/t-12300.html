I need to know the Spell Hit Conversion for a druid I have a shadowpriest main and wasn't to sure if the hit conversion was the same or any bit different. Thank you ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What matters when calculating spell hit percentages (and hence the cap) is your level and +spell hit talents.<br />
<br />
If you have a shadow priest you're familiar with the concept: Shadow Focus + 76 spell hit rating and you've hit the cap. Druids are similar, except their talent is less powerful: you need Balance of Power + 152 spell hit rating to hit the cap. Less if you're ally and will have a drae with the spell hit aura in your raid.<br />
<br />
Class has next to nothing to do with chance to hit with spells. The only impact it has is what talents you will put points into to get +spell hit. Hit rating is mathematically independent of your class. You still need +202 hit rating (base, without buffs or drae aura or anything) to hit the cap.</div></div><hr />
