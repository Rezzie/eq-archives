Am seriously thinking of going full resto at 60 or before, but i am wondering if doing so, would cause me to do less damage in feral form?<br />
I dont use any of the balance tree at all, just feral!<br />
Oh i have 10 points spent in resto for mark of wild and faster casting of healing touch......respecked to all my points in feral a while ago and found i died alot without these in resto.<br />
<br />
So is it possible to spek for full resto now and still do damage???<br />
<br />
Oh i do solo alot!!<br />
<br />
I need some guidance please :)<br />

Although most feral druids have some points to put in the Restoration tree. Namely Furor which is an awesome talent. And also Naturalist. It improves both HT and physical damage. Also you'd want to get Omen of Clarity.<br />
<br />
At 60 a popular feral spec is 0/41/10, working up to mangle. You will be surprised how much more damage you will do with the right build.<br />
<br />
I only recommend resto for instance grinding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Now that being said a good Resto druid can kick arse it just takes different tactics and a little bit more time. )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats what I have figured.....my dps will drop, and beeing an Aussy on an American server makes it hard sometimes to get a group....so questing alone is a frequent thing.<br />
<br />
I havnt yet had a real problem with being the main healer in an instance...with only the 10 points in resto, but having said that....have no idea how I will go on a raid lol.<br />
<br />
Soooo with all your advice and some from players I have spoken to, I think I will stay Feral....for the moment!<br />
<br />
Also.....how good is the Balance side of things???<br />
Havnt used balance in a serious way since level 10 lol!!!!!<br />
Is it any better than Feral??<br />
<br />
Thanx again<br />

I leveled feral, raided resto. Balance seems to be less popular than feral because good balance gear is hard to come by and most resort to cloth gear.<br />
<br />
I wish GWmort was still here. He'd have tons to tell you.</div></div><hr />
