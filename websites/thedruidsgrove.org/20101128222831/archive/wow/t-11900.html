<br />
I used Innervate for the 1st TIME just this weekend.  Honestly, I didn't even know what it was.  I have it on my hot bars, but I get into such a regular gameplay routine that I have never even glanced at it.<br />
<br />
I only discovered it when my Priest friend asked if I would Innervate him.  He had to tell me where to find it in my spellbook and what it could do! <br />
<br />
Imagine what a good druid I would be if I actually read up on my own abilities!    :ohwell: <br />

Self Slap - NOW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot count the times priests have used up all their mana far too quickly and then yelled &quot;Innervate me!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Or the discussions about who should get the innervate, the Druid him-/herself or the Priest, back in BWL/AQ40.<br />
<br />
Or even earlier, back when Innervate was the 31-point talent in the Resto tree and you couldn't get a place in a raid without it.<br />
<br />
Nowadays it is rarely called for and as many Druids are feral they can give it away more freely.<br />
<br />
<br />
But to be on the safe side: You've heard about that strange spell called &quot;Rebirth&quot;, yes? It has a red-orange symbol. It is kinda useful I heard *g*</div></div><hr />

At least both thottbot and wowhead say it requires Moonkin and/or ToL to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduan</div><div class="date">07-16-2007, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope any druid can use Innervate, including feral's.  Use it all the time, if I am in a instance run it is always on a cool down, well except at the beginning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, since discovering it ( :o ), I've used it several times.  <br />
<br />
Lovin' it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-16-2007, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder why the description in both thottbot and wowhead mention moonkin and/or ToL forms as being required?  Did it use to be that way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runningriver</div><div class="date">07-16-2007, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can cast in in those forms ToL and Moonkin... you have to pop out of your feral form inorder to cast innervate.<br />
<br />
there for any druid above lvl 40 can cast this spell</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">07-16-2007, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, before the big talent tree update right before TBC it was impossible to use Innervate in Moonkin form. It was originally a Restoration spell, but was changed to Balance to the cheers of adulation from Moonkin everywhere. Just a bit of random useless lore. ;)<br />
<br />
But yeah, you already got your answer... Innervate can be used in any caster form, just not in animal forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weaselking1973</div><div class="date">07-24-2007, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i end up using innervate alot... <br />
<br />
normally... thump.. preist dead... barkskin, rebirth, traq till priest is zoned back in then innervate them and shift back to bear.  <br />
<br />
takes a few to get that down right without getting stompped, but hell its fun to watch the groups reply when you rez the priest heal them and still keep agro from mobs =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Random Priest in MC: &quot;Innervate me!&quot;<br />
Non-Resto Druid: &quot;I didn't spec for it.&quot;<br />

<br />
Ya that.. and both the balance and feral tree were pretty much a joke back then. :/</div></div><hr />
