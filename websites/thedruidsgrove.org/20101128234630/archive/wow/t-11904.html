Later I'll have the entire row filled (with backfill points from Tier 5), but where do I put my first 5 points?<br />
<br />
Shredding Attacks<br />
Predatory Strikes<br />
Primal Fury<br />
<br />
I know I need to max out Predatory Strikes before I leave this tier, so do I populate PS first?  And then SA?  Or PF?<br />
<br />
At quick glance it would seem as though I should go...<br />
<br />
Shredding Attacks 2/2<br />
Predatory Strikes 3/3<br />
<br />
and leave PF 2/2 for the Tier 5 backfill points after I get FFF and Savage Fury.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2/2 Shredding Attacks<br />
2/2 Primal Fury<br />
1/3 Predatory Strikes<br />
1/1 FFF  (for &quot;in form&quot; pulls)<br />
2/2 Savage Fury<br />
3/3 Predatory Strikes<br />
<br />
As it just seems like PS is just a waste of points.  Sort of an odd way to make HotW an 8 point talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In your place, I would go with Primal Fury before Shredding Attacks, because Shred is primarily a group ability--you're only going to use it as an opener after Pounce while soloing (though, granted, with Shredding Attacks you -might- be able to get two Shreds in before the stun wears off if you time it right), so you'll get more bang for your buck with extra combo points from Primal Fury.<br />
<br />
My recommendation would be:<br />
<br />
2/2 Primal Fury<br />
3/3 Predatory Strikes<br />
1/1 FFF<br />
2/2 Savage Fury<br />
2/2 Shredding Attacks<br />
<br />
I think you could skip Shredding Attacks entirely if you have somewhere else you want to put the points. Again, this would ONLY apply to a build built around soloing. Shredding Attacks really shines when you're in a group.<br />
<br />
Interested to hear what others might suggest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why Primal Fury first?  While leveling you have such a low crit rate (mine is only 12%) it seems as though PF would be sort of a waste.  Plus I currently don't have anything to really spend my combo points on (only DoTs so why bother), so the extra combo point is worthless.  Once I get a real DD finisher I could see the value, but with just DoT finishers (more like mid-game relievers than finishers) it is just as easy to perform another DD attack than it is to &quot;spend&quot; your combo points.<br />
<br />
Looking at PS at say lvl 29 (as you suggested), would give me 29*1.5= 43.5AP, or 3.1 DPS.  Seems like I'd get more than 3 DPS from Shredding Attacks?  Maybe not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point on the crit issue, I hadn't considered that. I would say that Predatory Strikes would be the way to go, then, because so much of your damage is white damage. You're still not going to be using shred more than once or twice per combat while soloing, and you don't get Lacerate until much later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I thought about this a bit more.  I'm only going to get 1 shred (if any) off on a mob until I get pounce (lvl 36), so Shredding Attacks is a waste until lvl 36.  I don't get my first DD finisher until Bite (lvl 32).<br />
<br />
So, how about....<br />
<br />
 3/3 Predatory Strikes (improved white damage)<br />
 2/2 Primal Fury ('cause Shredding Attacks is worthless until lvl 36)<br />
 2/2 Savage Fury (claw and Rake are my primary DPS at this point)<br />
 1/1 FFF (free in-form pulls, if needed.  slight DPS increase due to reduced mob armor)<br />
 2/2 Shredding Attacks (wasted talent points as the benefit won't be seen for 2 more levels)</div></div><hr />
