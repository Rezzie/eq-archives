<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">02-10-2008, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you who don't know me, I'm Trixtaa and I've been playing a Druid since December of 2005 (oddly enough, the same time I started playing WoW). I've been on these forums for nearly the whole time as well.<br />
<br />
Well let's get down to the point...I think I've finally burned out on the game to the point where I couldn't care any less if I didn't get my arena games. Maybe all my RL and ingame buddies quitting/xferring had something to do or maybe I have grown out of video games. I've quit this game indefinitely and as a result, I doubt I will be of much help around these boards because of the way the game evolves. <br />
<br />
Many thanks to current and former TDG users for their endless knowledge and varied personalities. You guys made me understand and ultimately enjoy my time playing my druid and this game. I'll try to drop by and leave a post from time to time.<br />
<br />
As for now...this druid is hibernate<br />

<br />
When I joined the Grove as an entirely new WoW player with a Level 19 Druid, I remember that the first post I ever read was one of yours.  You've contributed a lot to Magellan's progress.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope to see you back someday.<br />
<br />
Found this on the official forums, it fits for here.<br />
<br />
May the road rise up to meet you, may the wind be ever at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face and the rain fall softly on your fields. And until we meet again, May Elune hold you in the hollow of her hand.</div></div><hr />

I hope, soon then, when I long on to Wowwiki.com and type &quot;Trixtaa&quot; search. A cool description of your legend appears.<br />
<br />
Take care my friend. TY for your tips, humor and knowledge. You really help make playing a druid worth playing a druid.</div></div><hr />

You were a great druid to talk to, very knowledgeable and always eager to help.  Bouncing ideas off you and learning from your wisdom has helped me a great deal over the past year.<br />
<br />
Good luck in whatever you choose to apply yourself to, I am sure you will be at least as successful if not more as you have been as a druid :&gt;<br />
