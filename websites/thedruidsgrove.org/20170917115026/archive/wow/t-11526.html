I have not been able to hold up a 5man in the new lvl 70 instances... and its not because theres bad CC since i rarely get agro, but its quite literally because i cant keep up.<br />
<br />
I started using mostly HT spells, mainly HT 8, but it wasnt fast enough, nor effective enough to keep the parties up. So i began to use HoTs more (dont have ToL since im 1:29:31 spec). These helped, but to be constantly throwing them on the tank not only runs me oom, but its then hard to focus on mabye another member whos off tanking or a caster who has agro... where hoTs arent enough.<br />
<br />
Is it the instances are too hard for druids long heals? is it my skill is auctually not good? :/<br />
<br />
And then you have the bosses... jeez you have that boss in shattered halls ( i think) who fears everyone but the MT, for like 4 secs... by the time im unfeared and have throw a quick rejuv + swiftmend the tank is dead.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help? throw any advice?<br />
<br />
i really do need it :S<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

If they don't need the heal I jump / esc the heal at the last second. Healing might be a bit harder since they nerfed +heal so its harder to downgrade easily.</div></div><hr />

It seems to help quite a bit. So far anway. I find that im not overhealing in the five mans if I throw a bloom first then a rejuv. If the tank is taking damage I rarely have to throw Bloom, Rejuv then a big heal. Unless shiat really hits the fan. <br />
<br />
With bloom stacking up to three times on a instant cast, so far it seems to be doing rather well and im not burning mana like I thought I would. I only have like +600 bonus healing as well, thats not really nothing to write home about.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Have you messed around with lifebloom at all yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richter</div><div class="date">02-03-2007, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">idd i have done. Although i always feel like im overdoing it when i pile on the lifeblooms... thats 600 mana used right there, for something which is equal to a backwards regrowth... i guess its all situational.<br />
<br />
Ill have a go at some 5 mans tonight using lifebloom a bit more and get back to you:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">02-03-2007, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're wasting mana if you stack lifebloom.  Only the first cast gets any benefit from your +heal gear and the blast of health at the end doesn't stack.  The only time stacking lifebloom is good, is against a dispel/purge happy opponent in PvP.  It heals for 600 or so each time part of the stack is purged/dispelled.<br />
<br />
You're better off tossing on a rejuv and one lifebloom and letting the bloom tick for the full amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Richter</div><div class="date">02-03-2007, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">guys, went on a few runs tonight and used single lifeblooms + rejuvs. went fantastic, thanks alot for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">02-12-2007, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also find Lifebloom to work well if someone has taken damage but stops getting hit (mob dies/feign death/yadda yadda) then toss a Bloom on them, toss a Rejuv/Regrowth on someone needing more attentive healing, when it hits, toss another Bloom on the other person.<br />
<br />
If you toss Lifebloom on when it's got 1 second left, it starts up again stacked so the heals per second increase. It's a nice cheap way to heal someone who needs health...but not RIGHT NOW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-12-2007, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lifebloom is far more mana effective if you use it once, let it expire, then use it again.  Reason being, +heal only counts on the first time you apply it.  On subsequent application, it just gets the base heal for the spell, which is minimal.  And if 3 are stacked, it doesn't 'bloom' for 1800 at the end, but rather 600.<br />
<br />
So tis better to rejuv, lifebloom, cast a ht, re-lifebloom, repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blueboy</div><div class="date">02-12-2007, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used rejuv/Lifebloom combo 90% of the time with HT 8,10,12 to get their health to a comfortable level and Regrowth 9 on stand by for quick heals. I'm Moonkin build with +500 spells with my Moonkin gear. I have Barkskin ready to cast on myself for a Tranquility heal on party too if it calls for it. I like to Rejuv/Lifebloom (no stacking on Lifebloom) combo on the main tanks and rogues and keep an eyes and ears (when Lifeblooms &quot;blooms&quot;) to cast it again on them to keep in going even if their health is full since they constantly taking damage. So far this method has worked for me very well. I&#8217;m a alchemist so I keep 2 Mana potions on me when on boss fight and do a &#8220;poor man&#8217;s innervate&#8221;. Taking a mana pot when Mana is at half way on my bar, thus giving me a full or near full mana. By the time Pot cool down is up, It should be ready to take another one. (I used this method when I innervate a priest) Other than that I innvervate myself as well as &quot;poor man's innervate&quot; if I am main healer. I miss my swiftmend and my tree form for healing but with this system I have fooled a lot of people thinking I am a healer build. I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">02-12-2007, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As feral spec, I use HT10 for MT healing, lifebloom and regrowth for off-healing. In heal gear, I have a lil over 1k +healing. I can keep a 5man group alive with that combo.<br />
<br />
As a resto spec, I use HT8 for MT healing, lifebloom, regrowth and rejuv for off-healing, and NS/Swiftmend for insta-heals.<br />
<br />
If I had ~500 +healing, I would probably have a difficult time keeping a 5man group up, based on my HT ranking. I would have to uprank even more, and risk running out of mana frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirage_fletcher</div><div class="date">02-19-2007, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to say this but I had the same problem  :(<br />
<br />
I was feral till around lvl62...then went Balance to lvl 70.<br />
So I decided I needed a change, so respecked to full Resto....that lasted around 2 weeks....simply because I couldnt keep up the heals.<br />
<br />
My bonus healing was 790 and i cant remember what the rest was now sorry!<br />
<br />
I put ALL my points in resto by the way.<br />
<br />
I found it terribly difficult to keep up the heals on the tank and the rest of group. As for tree form..hmmmm cant cast healing touch in that, so spent most my time in normal form lol<br />
<br />
Threw the usual HOT on tank and other party memers but my mana would run out only too often....in fact i found my mana runing out on normal mobs.<br />
When i was Balance going from lvl 60 to 70....i was mostly asked to heal by some groups in instances (as main healer) and Never had mana issies. Having said that......had gone back to same instances with my Resto build and ran out of mana early.<br />
I asked in my guild about it and got some really good tips from Druids there. I NEVER thought about it but they said they had rank 13 HT rank 10HT, rank 8HT, rank 5 HT all along their task bar and even a lower rejuve too as well as the highest lvl. The main person from my guild who talked to me has been Resto from the very beginning.<br />
<br />
That could be a tip for you :)<br />
<br />
But alas, i tried this more than once by the way lol, and i still had mana issues.<br />
I had over 7000 mana and i had around the same in health.<br />
<br />
I was under constant pressure...ohhh not by anyone at all...but I just was.<br />
<br />
My healing whilst feral was perfect and as was my healing as main healer when i was balance...maybe i was doing something wrong or my gear just didnt cut it!<br />
By the way I had a set of gear for healing and another set for feral annd yet another for moonkin lol<br />
<br />
Please dont let me discourage you....get all the info u can....but I respecked back to Balance and am loving it!!!<br />
 All my talent points are in Balance excepts for 10 wich are in resto....5 in IMW and 5 in the healing touch one (cant remeber its name lol)<br />
<br />
Hope you have luck in your healing in the future :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirage_fletcher</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...in my opinion it got harder not actually worse lol<br />
<br />
It was very difficult to keep up mana wise thats all.<br />
<br />
My gear whilst resto is too long to list but i had a great staff:<br />
<br />
Serpentcrest Life-Staff<br />
<br />
100-188 Dam<br />
(59.9 Dam per second)<br />
+27 Stamina<br />
+27Int<br />
+46 Spirit<br />
Equip increases healing done by spells &amp; effects by up to 227<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure how your healing became less efficient when u spec'd resto, unless u went ToL, and used HoT's only. Your heals are much stronger, and you should downrank your heals for mana efficiency. eg. Rank 8 HT (resto) instead of Rank 10 HT (non-resto), for the same effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on your points allocation, you could have up to 20% less mana than before as well, since Ferals gain that attribute with HoTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawktel</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">69 Moonkin, with +500 healing, 7K mana pool.<br />
<br />
I don't have any problem being the main healer for Mana Tombs, or below. Anything above that I prefer to have a secondary healer of some kind who is able to help out on some hard spots, Like a second druid, Priest, Shammy, or Paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirage_fletcher</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hawktel......I agree, instances above those u mentioned, tis wee hard to keep up heals as main healer!<br />
<br />
Now specked back to Balance as I mentioned before, but have no problem as back-up healer!<br />
<br />
Cant remember which lvl 70 instance it was (bad memory lol) but there were Fellguard type things in a room at the end of a hallway,then eventually a boss,  we had to pull one at a time, (was a great group btw) and I was main healer at the time, on ONE single fight, I ran completely out of mana, even after enervating myself. The fell things had a huge amount of hp. <br />
 As mentioned before I had over 7000 mana and around same in health.....used HOT and Healing Touch....had great gear ( well I hoped it was good enuf lol).........But mana still was a huge headache for me!<br />
<br />
I must research on being much more manaa efficient, if i were to spek back to Resto.<br />
<br />
Great advice too guys :)<br />
