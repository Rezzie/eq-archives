<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noobdruid</div><div class="date">05-26-2008, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So my son is about to start football camp and will be playing football his freshman year so he is &quot;giving up wow&quot; and so I have been given his PVP beast of a druid.  He has almost all S3 gear and most of the vindicators set.  Only problem, I have never played a Druid and I am not all that good at PVP.  My plans are to make him into a tank for the guild my 70's are in.  So the question is....  How good is S3 gear for PVE tanking?  He has the Feral gear btw.  I have been reading a lot and there are quite a few posts recommending upgrading pieces to S3 gear for PVE.  Just trying to figure out if I will need to do a complete over haul on his gear or if S3 pvp gear will hold me over while I pick up pieces here and there!</div></div><hr />

Cause it gets hard to reach the uncrit-cap without resilence.</div></div><hr />

The feral versions are the ones with &quot;Dragonhide&quot; in their names (not Wrymhide or Kodohide).  Assuming you have the feral version, keep the shoulders (if you have them) and the gloves.  Those are 2 slots that are hard to fill (shoulders especially) for feral tanks.  Heavy Clefthoof (craftable pieces) will give you 3 more slots (chest, legs, feet), stylin' purple hat, braxxis and/or earthwarden for your weapon.<br />

Here's a good link (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/04/15/shifting-perspectives-gearing-your-bear-tank-from-70-to-karazha/) that covers basic tanking gear (noob lvl 70, pre-kara, heorics, badge items).</div></div><hr />
