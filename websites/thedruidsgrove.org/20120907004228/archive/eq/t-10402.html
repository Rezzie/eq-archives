I'm almost to 30 and thought I should probably put some thought into this before I make an uneducated guess and choose one that doesn't work for me. I mostly use Alteration and Abjuration at level 29 but what about higher levels? Will I be using other schools as much or more with the higher level spells? Any help would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />

In most polls of druids we are fairly split down the center between those two specs.  Alteration is used for most healing spells and Evocation is used for most Nukes.  Your decision on what to specialize in should be based on what you like to do most as a druid.  If you prefer being healer in a group then alteration might be the way to go.  If you prefer to be a damage druid and nuking in groups then evocation is better.  Your specilzation is not set in stone you can always do the quest at the Temple of Ro to reset it at a later date.<br />

Very few druid specialize in the other areas however there are usually a few that take them up.  Conjuration is best for druid swarm line of dots, Abjuration for most buffs.  Druids have very few divination spells at higher levels.</div></div><hr />

Specialization simply equates to a small amount of mana savings for casting spells in your speciality. When it comes to healing, instinct and good timing are much more important compared to the one extra heal spell an alteration specced druid can cast due to mana savings. One extra nuke however, can sometimes (yes, it is rare) save the group/raid.</div></div><hr />

The fact that I'm not stuck with it if I decide different later really helps. Thanks so much for all your replies. They really helped me decide which way to go. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Banbin</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alternation all the way. Due to the mana consumption of heals, taking a certain % off a heal spell is going to save more mana then % off a nuke. Also, our debuffs use Alternation for the most part. Debuffing and Healing is a lot of druids spend their time doing on raids.</div></div><hr />

After that, I switched him to Evocation.  And when our specs got reset on Dec. 15th, I stuck with Evo as primary.</div></div><hr />

After that I switched to Alteration to help out with our percent heals (Tunare's, Karana's renewal).  Keep in mind, that there is no focii in the game that affects mana consumption on these heals.  The only two things that affect it are Specializing in Alteration and SCM.  Our heals can get very expensive (manawise) the closer you get to 70.</div></div><hr />
