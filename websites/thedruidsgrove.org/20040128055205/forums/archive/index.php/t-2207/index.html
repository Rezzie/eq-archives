<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LilWolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I powerleveled a bard to 12, and his 1hs was 16 or so... so I decided to get his skills up. <br />
<br />
So I went to crush... why?  I was there.  Went inside and did the same as PLing but without the damage shield.  Went ok... until I found a secret.<br />
<br />
The SLAVE was HEALING A SLAVER!!!  the slaver was light blue and doing couldn't outdamage my regen... So he just sat there swinging for 15 minutes!  It was GREAT went to max 1hs, defense AND affense without doing ANYTHING ELSE!<br />
<br />
but then it all went away (was hoping to get 1hb and piercing up too)... the NPC despawned and the next wasn't a healer.<br />
<br />
So, where are some good zones with NPC healers!  I would LOVE to get a good list of non-agroing healers that will just heal my mobs away.  If you find them the right level, your job just became SO easy...<br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BriennaMonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Higher level, but Permafrost has always torked me off with all the healers in there.<br />
<br />
Back in the oldedn days I hated when I'd camp the Preacher and be nuking away trying to kill placeholders, but there's an out of sight Priest healing away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 15 or so, maybe a little less, i used orc priests in oasis for my shadow knight. Since you have regen (i had a fungi) they cant hit fast enough to keep up with the regen. I found some fast weapons of each melee type and would pull a priest to the northwest corner of the zone, turn on auto attack and attack until it would flee. When it got out so far it would stop fleeing and stand there. When it got enough mana it would heal itself and come back to me. I would go out to get a bite for lunch and do this afk. Maxed all weapon skills at 100 this way.<br />
<br />
As a druid, there are a few places to practice weapon skills along the way. At mid 30's you can go to marus seru and kill the stonegrabbers. They have really good regen and regen faster than a druid can swing a sword. Just nuke it down to flee mode and keep it snared and you can hit at it for 10 to 20 minutes before it dies. You can do the same thing with Seafury Cyclops in Ocean of Tears in your early/mid 50's. For defense in your late 40's (you can do this all the way to 65) go to Tower of Frozen Shadow and get to the second floor. There is a bookcase that is a trap that will raise defense. Just put on a skin and regen and stand next to it till your almost dead, back up, heal and repeat.</div></div><hr />
