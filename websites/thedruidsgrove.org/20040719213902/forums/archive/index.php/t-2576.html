Grennik Neltrin says 'Hello. Have you been exploring the island? I came here to discover the secrets of the Broken Skull trolls but I have yet to even explore the island. Rumors that their high priest Nadox held the power to cure any disease have been drifting around Norrath for some time. I've come to see if the rumors are true. Unfortunately, the island is much more dangerous than I had imagined and I haven't found anything useful. If you find anything having to do with the troll High Priest, please bring it to me.'</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Everquest, players undertake tasks with an online avatar in a persistent fantasy world to garner increases in the effectiveness of said avatar versus the environment, or to a limited extent, other players.  It goes without saying that the majority of the members reading this board are familiar with the time and effort required in gaining experience, acquiring equipment, or undertaking quests.  The amount of effort exerted to complete a particular task may vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors including luck, skill, tenacity, resourcefulness, and outside assistance, but there is still some measure of exertion just the same.<br />
<br />
My stance is that the model of &quot;effort -&gt; reward&quot; is fundamental in the design of Everquest, and to insinuate that players of the game be allowed to bypass the effort and simply receive the boon is nothing short of absurd.  Were we to apply this same flawed thought process universally and eliminate all challenges, then achievement would lose its meaning.  There would cease to be a game.<br />
<br />
This was the argument I was attempting to make when I drew a parallel between the concepts of spells on a vendor and gear on a vendor.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if this was unclear the first time.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Woops, grammar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since casters also need to attain gear.<br />
<br />
Spell acquisition is different from and in addition to the gear acquisition process, and so I do not find the parallel sound.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its hardly unprecedented for spells to be sold by vendors.  I don't think that adding a few mid - lower level spells on a vendor with a new expansion is going to undermine the fundamentals of the game.  <br />

I understand why Mask of the Stalker, Hunter, Form of the Hunter are all hard to get and require a group of folks that can kill boss mobs.  <br />
<br />
I understand why it's felt that Greater Remove Curse should be held on a highly contested mob and therefore making it a PITA to get.<br />
<br />
I DO NOT understand why a sub 60 spell should be such a pain to get :) <br />
<br />
I also agree that your parallel hardly holds water due to the insane amount of time I've spent getting pieces of my gear.  Yes, melee have to acquire new gear, but so do casters.  Now put our spells on a vendor please hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendan</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is also another NPC with the following text:<br />
<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:13:17 2003] You say, 'Hail, Nolwik Barquin'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:13:18 2003] Nolwik Barquin says 'The salty air grows stale in this place. As if the essence of Tunare and Karana have been shut out by the dark tide of Broken Skull. The wind of Karana grows wild and restless, and the water of the mother turns black as it touches the tainted stone of Innoruuk. Were it not for my [promise] to Xanuusus I would not be here.'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:13:35 2003] You say, 'What promise?'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:13:36 2003] Nolwik Barquin says 'Since I was a boy, Xanuusus has entrusted me with a pair of holy symbols, one of Karana, and one of Tunare. I guarded them faithfully since that day until recently. I had been patrolling Innothule swamp in hopes of finding the wayward trolls that had been disturbing those of Tunare's children that inhabit the wetlands. Unknown to me at the time, a new [presence] was there in the swamp that day.'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:13:52 2003] You say, 'What presence?'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:13:52 2003] Nolwik Barquin says 'I had just found a troll threatening a water moccasin a fair distance from the gates of Grobb. The troll looked to be dressed a bit differently then most of the other trolls I'd found recently. He had a patch over one eye, and his armor appeared to be of much higher quality then anything the Basher's normally carried. I paid it no heed though, and continued planning my [attack] on the unsuspecting troll.'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:14:06 2003] You say, 'What attack?'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:14:06 2003] Nolwik Barquin says 'Just as I was beginning to weave my first spell against the troll, a large wet figure struck me by surprise knocking me to the ground. I staggered to my feet and looked at my attacker. It was a larger then normal troll holding a rather large curved sword and shield. It scowled at me with a sort of enraged hunger as it licked its lips in apparent anticipation of a fresh [meal].'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:14:19 2003] You say, 'What meal?'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:14:19 2003] Nolwik Barquin says 'As fate would have it the troll would go hungry that night. Although I was badly injured from his initial strike, I was able to stand and weave the roots of the nearby trees around his feet which allowed me time to gate away before more of his friends arrived. It wasn't until I arrived in the plains of Karana that I realized that I had lost my holy [emblems].'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:14:32 2003] You say, 'What emblems?'<br />
[Mon Feb 24 19:14:33 2003] Nolwik Barquin says 'I highly doubt that the trolls know the importance of the symbols they have stolen from me, but I am sure they at least recognize the value of the metal they were forged from. I suspect that they have tossed them in with the rest of their treasure as if they were nothing more then gold coins. I must get them back at all costs.'<br />
<br />
In Nadox it seems that &quot;a treasure sorter&quot; is an uncommon spawn at any troll spawn point, but everyone I've spoken with that has killed a few say they drop nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would have been refreshing to have these spells sold on a vendor, considering the recent hassles of PoP spells.  However, questing and putting in some effort for what you get is the nature of the game.  As poorly implemented as it may turn out to be, there wouldn't be much of a game if everything was handed to you on a silver platter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went hunting there tonight and got as a drop the item Pure Blood. No drop, Clr/Dru/Sha, looks like a  potion. I got about 8 of them thinking i could help hook up my guildies....sounds like the scroll is no-drop though, so so much for that idea Lol. It was a pretty common drop and they dropped off of Luggald Initiates past the bridge in Nadox.<br />
<br />
I have'nt tried turning anything in yet, I got sidetracked doing some other exploring and never got around to it but I did read on the boards that someone turned in a Pure Blood to Grennik Neltrin and it was eaten.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its a great spell in that we get it when it's VERY hard to be a healer for a group.<br />
<br />
but if we can't find it until 50+ then it will be useless (similar to focus items II items that are no-drop that come off of lvl 50+ mobs... duh!)..</div></div><hr />

You didn't mention which spell so I'd assume you're referring to the 44th level 'Healing Water' spell. I'd say for its cast time, it will be somewhat useful until 55th level Chloroblast, especially if HW is enhanced by spell haste. <br />
<br />
If you're talking about Pure Blood, which removes 18 disease counters and 18 poison counters -- I'd hardly consider that useless beyond 50th level. :) <br />

The symbol of Tunare and the Symbol of Karana.  The other quest giver talks about bringing back an item which tentitively has been identified as Pure Blood from someone that has new healing powers.   <br />
<br />
My speculation is: <br />
Symbol of Tunare (healing) + pureblood = spell:Pureblood.<br />
Symbol of Karana (Rain) + Pureblood = spell:Healing Water<br />
<br />
Just a guess but if he is accepting the pureblood then that is only part of the turn in.  If there are two spells and two symbols there may be a connection.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Yes, hand foraged garbage in to quest givers first.  If they don't return it, you can't tell anything by them eating your rare quest peice drop because they simply eat everything.  Sadly there are a LOT of mobs like this now since they did a really crappy job with PoP and now LoY in making sure NPCs react properly.  At least I haven't caught any LoY mobs casting spells they're not high enough to cast yet like you can see in PoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly, if you're missing another item the NPC will say &quot;I asked for two XXXX&quot; or &quot;I require both XXXX and XXXX to create the spell&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT- Ok, just read this and thought I should add it on.  Some quest NPCs are now not accepting quest items until you first hail them and they &quot;see&quot; that the item they want is in your inventory.  Sort of like the planar manual quests.  I guess this is to stop MQing.  So before handing in anything to quest givers, hail them first and maybe go through their dialog just to be sure. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zenia Bigbootea</div><div class="date">02-25-2003, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What most of you fail to realize, and what Prat is saying is, that Melee fight with their equipment, as casters fight with their spells, gear or equipment means little to a caster other than to dictate amount of mana and resistance to damage and or spells.  In much the same way a melee character must work hard to obtain said items, so must casters work at least in some way to obtain spells deemed to be special or above and beyond the norm.<br />
Lets stop and think a minute about the fact that even naked a caster has the ability to fight a battle with his spells, where as unless your a monk, melee don't have anything at all to offer naked.  Spells account for more than you realize, and aren't just another pain in the @#%$ part of progression, that is why they make it difficult to obtain said spells.<br />
<br />
So enough with the bitching about oh please put it on a vendor, and lets try and make a productive thread to help us figure out this quest.<br />

<br />
Or that we have to lose a inventory slot because we have to put in our spellbook?<br />
<br />
And for the lack of being dependant of our equipement as caster, with the focus effect and the FT effect, it is no true. Try to keep a no stop pulling in a group if your caster don't have equipements, sorry I have to be medding for 6 mins between eatch pull because you are oom.<br />
<br />
DO having spells help a lot, yes; because without spells the caster class are nothing. Imagine a level 65 druid having only his level 1 spells, do he will be able to heal a level 65 tank be using his healing spell that heal 10 hp? Yes (only outside of the fight), but it will be faster to bind wound the tank.<br />
<br />
Like it have say before:<br />
- The ones saying spells = equipements are melees.<br />
- The ones saying spells != equipements are casters.<br />
<br />
And none seem to be willing to change their thinking.<br />
<br />
Now can we stop to continue this discution (the spell =  or != equipement) eatch time the we get news spells. It is going nowhere and it alway the same arguments that get repeted eatch time.<br />

What I'd like to see is a quest to learn new abilities for melee.  Say legend has it that there is a Monk who lives in a far away land who has the ability to double kick.  You have to seek items that would lead you to him via information from NPC's finally resulting in an item that takes you to him.  Once you find him, he is the only trainer that trains double kick either by conventional means or dialog.<br />
<br />
This could be a fun alternative to AA, Warriors could quest for a way to taunt that's more effective then weapon procs and spells.  Rogues the ability to run and sneak at the same time.  Rangers could shoot 2 arrows at once for small decrease in damage per arrow, yet better total damage.  Pallies and SKs could quest to be able to re-use LoH and HT faster respectively.  etc...:)</div></div><hr />

It seems a lot of the NPC's in this expansion work on a flagging system- you don't *hand in* your items to them. Instead, you simply hail them with the item in your inventory. They recognize it and a new item (a flag of sorts) appears in your inventory as a result. <br />
<br />
Seems like a way to prevent MQ'ing in the new extension, if you ask me, but still...may be worth trying.<br />

<br />
turned in &quot;a torn scroll&quot; or something like that, which dropped for me in the crypt of nadox. she gave it back to me saying to find more of them. it wasn't a generic &quot;i have no need for this item&quot; thing, but actually said there should me more pieces like that around. I've heard from others that other pages dropped all around nadox from other mobs. I got my torn page from one of the trolls, and another druid got 2. One from a human, and one from the lugsomething, so i'm guessing that you turn in the 4 different scroll pages and get pure blood or healing water in return. I'm guessing pure blood, since it fits in with the whole conversation with her.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

I went back online earlier to get a log of the conversation, so here it is:<br />
<br />
[Wed Feb 26 02:11:24 2003] Grennik Neltrin says 'Hello, Riddil.  Have you been exploring the island?  I came here to discover the secrets of the Broken Skull trolls but I have yet to even explore the island.  Rumors that their high priest Nadox held the power to cure any disease have been drifting around Norrath for some time.  I've come to see if the rumors are true.  Unfortunately the island is much more dangerous than I had imagined and I haven't found anything useful.  If you find anything having to do with the troll High priest, please bring it to me.'<br />
<br />
I turned in &quot;a torn scroll&quot; (lore no drop) and Grennik returned it to me and said:<br />
<br />
[Wed Feb 26 02:11:44 2003] Grennik Neltrin scans the scroll and looks up at you.  Hmm.  This scroll seems to be a page from the book of Nadox.  There must be more where this came from.  If you can find the other pages you may be able to piece together some better information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been working hard on this last 2 days now and have made some great progress.  This is what i have learned:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you turn in the no drop scroll ( and yes there is more than one) the NPC says the text about more pages needed....  BUT<br />
<br />
If you turn in the no drop scroll with the 2 no drop vials ( blakened and skull) and the pure blood (total of 4 items) the NPC says that it is the elixir that the Troll High Priest used to cure pois/dis and if you can replicate it you would also achieve that power.    <br />
<br />
Is it possible that we need a container to combine the items in before giving to NPC?<br />
<br />
Would the container fall off of a troll high priest? ...and if so has anyone seen a high priest?<br />
<br />
also the no drop scrolls identify as - <br />
 &quot; seem to be enscribed in a troll language --- p 129, 130....&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asharia</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that the quest for all the other casters are given out by the only NPC around the lighthouse that will give bracketed text (Caergin Coldtongue? for BST, for example), wouldn't it follow that the NPC who talks about Xanuusus sending him is our quest mob, and we need the two symbols that he is talking about?  Has anyone found any symbols anywhere?<br />
<br />
For example: The beastlord 44 spell is as easy as following Caergin's text, getting a stone from him, taking it to his lost warder, and returning the item from the warder to Caergin.  Voila, spell.  Can't be any more difficult than that.  The 52 BST spell is an item dropped from deeper in LoY that you return to him if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's just my point, I don't think it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that hard, I think &lt;em&gt;we're&lt;/em&gt; trying too hard.  The first spell has to be easy... it's a 44 spell.  Has anyone gotten it yet?  I haven't seen anything to indicate it on this thread.  The NPC says that the trolls that attacked him took the symbols, he wants them back.  Find symbol, turn in, get spell.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Go to Dulak and kill &quot;a storage attendant&quot; and &quot;a shady treasure sorter.&quot; Each will occasionallly drop a golden emblem that identifies as &quot;Symbol of Tunare&quot; or &quot;Symbol of Karana&quot; respectively. Get one from each, turn them in to Nolwik, and collect your copy of Healing Water. Easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">02-26-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least for the first part, if there are multiples.<br />
<br />
From the script the poster on the last page got, the woman is looking for multiple pages.<br />
<br />
I think you need to find 4 and hand them in.  I have 2 now...I don't know if they are lore, or if they identify with unique page numbers (like oh so very, very many quests...find 4 pages of this book).<br />
<br />
After that she may send you to do another task in another place, much like the bard quest sends the bard to Qeynos to do a turn in, and then back.  <br />
<br />
If the vials are involved, it might be at that point.  Until I see something to the contrary, though, I am thinking what we are after is four torn pages.<br />
<br />
EDIT ... confirmed pages are lore.  So there is more than one.  Think simple...think 4 different pages.  Gotta get myself a mask and identify it but yes I think it will be that easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viciado Sylvannis</div><div class="date">02-27-2003, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished this quest tonight, after some brainstorming with Elyda from the prior evening, we're in the same guild /wave Elyda :)  . all the different bloods had gotten me thinking from a brewing aspect like the 7th shawl quest and such. Here's the deal:<br />
<br />
In a brew barrel combine A Blackened Vial (drop in Nadex) + the troll skull blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands) + Gunthak Gulf Water (Foraged and dropped in Gunthak). You get A Black Potion.<br />
<br />
Then combine A Black Potion + Pure Blood (dropped off a Luggold Initiate in Nadox) to recieve A Glowing Black Potion.<br />
<br />
You may be able to hand in the glowing black potion all by itself for the spell, but I handed in the &quot;A Torn Page&quot; (no-drop, all/all, Nadox drop) along with it to the npc and I got my Pure Blood scroll!  Sadly the scroll is no-drop as suspected, I had extra parts and was hoping to hook up some guildees.<br />
<br />
No idea if you need to turn in the torn page along with the glowing black potion or not, or which one you need. for the record my page identified as pg 129, and was given back along with the spell. <br />
<br />
*Edit* Concerning the brewing combines, I have a 212 brewing skill and got trivial messages but I strongly suspect that these are no-fail combines, or so I hope for the sake of those not inclined toward tradeskills. Good hunting all!<br />

<br />
HUGE THANX TO VICIADO for solving this quest for us!!<br />
I have just completed it and have a bit of Info to add on.<br />
&quot;the troll skull blood (drop in Nadex off the Blackhands)&quot;<br />
Actual name of this is &quot;Broken Skull Clan Blood&quot; and does indeed drop off Blackhands as does the Blackened Vial. Just work your way up the right tunnel where they all hang.<br />
<br />
I turned in just the Glowing Black Potion without the Torn Page and got the spell, so that confirms you don't need that part.<br />
<br />
I am a 250 Brewer so I am afraid I can not provide any info on trivials<br />
<br />
Once again BIGTIME THANX to VICIADO for solving this. Couldnt have gotten the spell without your help.<br />

<br />
she says now that i need more pages =p so /shrug<br />
<br />
<br />
i also handed in a scroll of &quot;unholy scribings&quot; .... she chomped it with no text.  <br />
<br />
As the 2 spells are completely confirmed.... and this is a post on them i wont post anymore on my playings with the pages here)  I'm sure it has to do with something else completely.<br />

  Feanan's post seems about right for the drops for me.  For druids just grab a boar from the mines with call of karana/glamour of tunare/savage spirit/shield of braken and you can rip through stuff like paper (give it a couple weapons too, it'll even visibly equip them amusingly enough.)<br />
 <br />
  For non-druids, ugh, I pity clerics farming this crap even with their hammer and nifty new reverse damage shield and hammer pet.</div></div><hr />

I two box, a druid and a ranger, and i only worked brewing up on the ranger, he's at 200 so i'm pretty ticked off at this. Now i gotta spend some time and money on combines on the dr00d too. Didnt know about the fishing grub and water thing though, so that will help. Hope i dont fail a 2nd combine, ive been in nadox every night after raids, and have only seen one broken skull clan blood myself so far. <br />

24 blackhands - Broken Skull Clan Blood<br />
14 broken skull initiate/adherent - A blackened vial <br />
6 luggald abomination/initiate - Pure Blood[/quote]<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I didn't get any vials off the broken skull initiates in the shrine.  However, if you go down to the room that is full of initiates and adherents (near the lava flow) and go to the empty cave (with the adandoned shovel and wheelbarrow), you can pull single initiates and adherents who are guarding the door -- just be careful about your pull -- don't get too close to the wall of the main room or you'll be charged by a half-dozen casters.  The adherents gate, BTW, so have your indoor stun up (if you have one).<br />
<br />
The blackhands were much easier -- just stand in the hallway behind the room (not from out front), and you can pull 1 at a time once you clear the 2 door guards.  Watch out for the occasional roamer.<br />
<br />
Still working on luggalds, will let you know...</div></div><hr />

Besides foraging the stupid Gulf of Gunthak Water (which took me about two hours -- I felt like I was doing my epic again), this part took the longest. <br />
<br />
The chamber seems to be made up of 5 rooms.<br />
<br />
....1.................2<br />
.............3<br />
....4.................5<br />
...........|....|<br />
......Main Entrance<br />
<br />
There are halls off #3 leading to other areas, but this is the main place to hunt luggalds for our spell.<br />
<br />
I couldn't really find a good place in rooms 2, 3, or 5 to pull.  But I could stand in the upper left corners of rooms 1 and 4 and pull 1 or 2 luggalds at once.  I cleared room #4 twice with no blood.  I went to room #1 and got it near the end of clearing it, off an initiate.  I'm not sure if abominations drop it, but you'll have a hard time not pulling some [on a related note, I don't know if BS adherents drop the blood, but they are similarly situated near the BS initiates].  It may just be a luck thing.  But I can at least confirm it drops in room #1.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<br />
All I can tell you is that the two beastlord spells require little or no trouble.  The 52 spell simply requires a delivery run within Gunthak and the 44 spell requires a single drop off of a random troll in Torgiran Mines.  Total time for me to get both bl spells was next to nothing.  Either bl's are getting it way easy (I have only seen bl and druid spell spoilers), or druids are getting it shoved in them.  Guess I will only do Pure Blood and not even worry about the healing spell, doesn't really apply to me anyways.</div></div><hr />

They are not green if you do them around the level of the spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
So on every other class forum I have been to gathering these quest info, there is always a sticky thread at the top with a solution. TDG seems to be missing this.  Has anyone compiled the solution for the 2 quests in a presentable fashion that doesn't require sifting through 5 pages of posts and counter-posts.<br />

<br />
That's true, the level of the spell is similar to the mob level.  Problem is, this is far and again our best cure spell all the way to 65.  So, even the 65 druids need it and the mobs are green to them.  Now, if VI could figure out a way to make something like this challenging &lt;strong&gt;for every level range that would use it&lt;/strong&gt; I think we would all be a lot happier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I got both of them Saturday night after around five hours camping storage workers and shady treasure sorters. At least, I got one of them myself, and I received the other one complements of a bard from Eternal Wrath (thanks Kinuvan) who found one while looking for a lute on the treasure sorters. I did start poking around Nadox, got nothing, and therefore think I must have been killing mobs in the wrong area. Eventually I'll go back, but I'm kinda waiting until the next patch in the hope that the quest for Pure Blood will be made a little more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Sad part is I subjected myself to the Healing Water camp even though I have no use for the spell...just want as complete a spellbook as possible. :)</div></div><hr />

Go to Dulak and kill &quot;a storage attendant&quot; and &quot;a shady treasure sorter.&quot; Each will occasionallly drop a golden emblem that identifies as &quot;Symbol of Tunare&quot; or &quot;Symbol of Karana&quot; respectively. Get one from each, turn them in to Nolwik, and collect your copy of Healing Water. Easy.[/quote]<br />
<br />
And here I thought that the quest for Beguile Plants was a pain in the arse. *sigh* Non-complicated the Healing Water spell might be, but I spent 3 hours camping the 'a storage attendant' and 'a shady treasure hunter' and all I got was a Golden Medallion of Service and a Silver Medallion of Service, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what's needed apparently. (Where's my T-shirt that says, &quot;I camped Dulak and all I got was this lousy T-shirt? *G*)<br />
<br />
For those at my level or so (45), have a group with you. Your survival chances go up significantly as the mobs con dark blue to me at my level. Four of us were able to slowly pull from the building.<br />
<br />
Next, unless you want to fight every step of the way, get you and your group invised (Super Cami'd, whatever).<br />
<br />
Never ever camp next to a building wall in Dulak Harbor to rest, meditate, gather information. We learned to our chagrin, that critters aggro &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; the walls. At that point, SoW is your friend.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just discovered that 'a storage attendant' and 'a shady treasure sorter' spawn in two buildings. One located at -98, -950 and the other at -282, -1075. The latter is closest to the wharves and ships. So...do the symbols in question drop in both spots or only one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">03-10-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;A storage attendant&quot; does NOT drop the gold emblem, I am convinced.   It drops a golden medallion of service that looks exactly like it, but is for a different quest.<br />
<br />
Instead, you want to kill &quot;a storage worker&quot; to get the one gold emblem (took me about 15 kills once I figured out I was focusing on the wrong mob), and the shady treasure sorter for the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both storage workers and shady treasure sorters spawn in 3 separate locations in Dulak.  These are buildings in which you can find storage workers, storage attendants, and sorters.   The spawns are constant for each type, and static.   One building is next to the engineer/architect building (right in front of you from the zone in), and the other two are back to the left, one in front of the third (middle) ship, the other right across the street (it has a shady sorter right outside the front door to the left).  Interestingly, there is a storage attendant and one other (I think a worker) in a fourth location in the back alley behind this last building.   You can only get to it by jumping up and over the fence right behind the above-mentioned shady sorter to the left of the front door.  You also will have to gate out as I couldn't find any way to get back out by jumping (doesn't mean there isn't some way, of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
One day last week there was a druid/shaman duo there for the blood when I showed up.  I helped them clear the room and the last mob in the room dropped blood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today I was able to clear faster and friend and I saw 2 drops from one spawnage of the center area.  Makes me feel like I possibly wasted my time in the corner &quot;rooms&quot; there off and on for 3 days =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pinepath</div><div class="date">03-28-2003, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing of note.  I got a full bubble of AA exp for turning in the potion for the Pure Blood quest.  A day or so later, since I had the stuff, I completed the quest again.  Got another copy of the spell, but zero exp. <br />
<br />
It could be they nerfed the exp in that time, but likely they have figured out a way, using flags, to only give exp for a quest completed the first time.  Very good, afaic, if it lets them have quests with decent exp rewards for the level to do them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only map I've seen doesn't show spawns and trying to learn the zone just for this spell is a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
/mourn to those who have failed the final combine.  I'm at 248 brewing and would be upset myself if I failed it.<br />

<br />
Stuck on the Pure Blood part atm.  Up to something like 90 luggolds and no drop yet.  Awesome...<br />
<br />
What is this I read about charming boars and pigs in Nadox? <br />
<br />
Btw, I'd like to say cong on LoY to SoE.  In all the time I've spent there lately, I have yet to see more than 3 other people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Oh nevermind you were probably referring to his finishing the quest in 2 hours not that he did it with a zero skill in brewing :evil:  Two hours is lucky! I had trouble getting all the drops from Nadox!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Role Meggido</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally finished this a while back.  Here is my advice:<br />
<br />
-Charm is your friend.<br />
<br />
Charm the highest level boar you can (exhausted if you have CoT) and go to work with that.  Otherwise (unless you're stupendously geared) this is going to be a really awful time.<br />
<br />
While you are learning the zone make sure to pull to open areas before you move in too deep.<br />
<br />
General charm recomendations:<br />
-get weapons for your pet (gnoll hide lariats (or anything else that procs stun), weapons that proc slow, or just decent damage weapons like mace of the fallen crusader. <br />
-keep your pet ensnared.  A good habit is to refresh ensnare each time charm breaks.  Putting glamor of tunare (animial only magic resist debuff) on every third time is also generally considered good form.<br />
-root everything you're engaged on.  this will buy you some life when charm breaks.  preferably have earthen roots up for recharming, debuffing the pet and savage up for rooting mobs.<br />
-ensnare everything you're engaged on while you're starting out.  you may find this unnecessary when you get to be familiar and are keeping everything rooted consistantly, but better safe than sorry.<br />
-buff that pet: savage spirit, str buff, skin, damage shields, regen.<br />
-make sure to at the very minimum do some damage to each mob.  ideally you will be dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eridalafar</div><div class="date">08-18-2003, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some cue about the mobs you need to kill.<br />
<br />
1- Be sure to kill the mobs in the right room, the mobs can have the same names but if it isn't in the right room, he will never drop what you need.<br />
<br />
2- The items drop are realy random, already get the blood 6 time in the same evening and another evening 0 have droped.<br />
<br />
About the xp for doing the spells quest (the 2), they are a hidden flag the prevent you to get the xp more that one time (but the xp is very good for a quest).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clakar</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have more specifics regarding where the Nadox mobs are that drop these items.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm killing all the wrong mobs or the right mobs in the wrong rooms.<br />
<br />
Nadox isn't an exp zone for me so I don't really know camp names.  I'm looking for locs or something that could help.  Then I can reference those with maps I've got to find the right rooms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corvalis</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I borrowed this from a Cleric friend of mine:<br />
<br />
Directions to the Nadox bits (describing without a map, bear with me):<br />
- Enter Gunthak, swim south to beach, invis up, go through the tunnels, through the town, to the &quot;castle&quot; entrance to Nadox.<br />
- Once in Nadox (still invis), take left exit from the entrance room, then go stright down the hall to the 3rd(2nd?) right (from the hall you'll see into a big room with a &quot;fountain&quot; in the middle, *filled* with trolls). Kill those trolls (light blue to a 65) to get the &quot;blackened vial&quot;. Note: there is a funky respawn trap in the doorway, fight back down the hall a bit, unless you like adds.<br />
- Once you get the &quot;blackened vial&quot;, invis up, and go straight through the &quot;fountain&quot; room, and down the hall. You'll get to a &quot;big round room&quot; filled with trolls, and past that is a &quot;cave with a fire&quot; and more trolls. Kill those trolls (light blue to a 65) to get &quot;Broken Skull Blood&quot;.<br />
- Once you get the &quot;Broken Skull Blood&quot;, go over the bridge in the &quot;cave with the fire&quot;. Find Luggalds (dark blue to a 65) and kill them for the &quot;Pure Blood&quot;. (I got mine off the first luggald we saw right over the bridge, a &quot;lugglad abomintion&quot;, but there should be more in deeper).<br />
<br />
The Nadox bits can be done quite easily by a group of 3, takes maybe 3 hours. The Gunthak bit can be done solo, or easily duoed (or foraged, darn druids), don't know how long that takes yet.<br />
<br />
Easier explanation (possibly) is: <br />
<br />
Once you cross the Gunthak beach and enter the cave, take the second tunnel to the left - that takes you to the Nadox lava zone. Nothing sees invis. Swim til you see the bridge ahead and go up the right bank to a wide open area. As you look at the bridge, the blood droppers will be just through the first entrance on the right, the vial droppers will be just inside the 2nd entrance to the right, and the luggolds for pureblood will be through the doorway straight across the bridge (left side of lava river). You can also get gunthak gulf water fishing - lucky fisherman :)</div></div><hr />
