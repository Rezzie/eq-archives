<br />
I'm feral at the moment, and I'm being put in the rogue / DPS warrior group for LOTP and iLOTP.<br />
<br />
We take down Hakkar first and gets to Jin'Do... When we're at Jin'Do im 3rd on the dmg meter, just right behind our best geared rogue and warrior :)<br />
<br />
I'm tanking Jin'Do as usual... he does not have sunder armor on but he does have Faerie Fire - and guess what... I get a 1.864 bear mangle followed by a 1.4K Maul :D<br />
<br />
I laughed so hard I couldn't stop :D Seriously... Mangle is everything the druids ever needed if you ask me ... I love my druid now :D<br />

<br />
Got a 3K ferociousbite on Moam yesterday... And shred has become so very nice these days ;)<br />
<br />
If you're guild haven't let you tanked Jin'Do yet, ask :D Its fun and you get some nice mangle numbers in bear on that bugger...</div></div><hr />

Brek, what kind of ap do you have in bear form?  I assume you were fully raid buffed, but still, wow.  <br />
<br />
I just (finally!) respeccd 0/41/10 last night for lvling in BC, and omfg i LOVE being back to my feral roots.  I forgot how much I LOVED being feral after being raiding resto speccd for the past 9 months.  <br />
<br />
I went to solo / grind some cash / test out my new abilities at Tyr's hand, and right off the bat popped at 2.1k FB.  Thats the highest I've ever seen.  I was killing easily in cat form, then decided to take on a couple in bear form.  My highest mangle crit was only about 900... how godly decked out are you that you got a 1.8k mangle ?!  wow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arestavo</div><div class="date">01-16-2007, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were probably 5 sunders or a 5 combo point expose armor on Jin'Do, along with Farie Fire which would make for a lot less armor on mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-16-2007, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, that makes sense.  I wasn't thinking of the debuffs on Jin'do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">01-17-2007, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh, Jin'Do had 5 sunders on him.. Fully buffed I had about 14K armor and 1100 attackpower in bear (with Blessing of Might) ... I usually get to DPS in raids now, because I am always top 5 on dmg meters, and it really helps for the rogues damage, as well as healing really..<br />
<br />
Though I tested TBC yesterday, so wont be much ZG going on now ;) tested the 2 new instances... Pretty darn fun if you ask me...</div></div><hr />
