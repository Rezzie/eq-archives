<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like never use Legacy of Bracken, had it for a while, but I see other druids using group damage shields all the time, so I actually looked at it.<br />
<br />
The description says it lasts for 16 minutes, for 380 mana.  Thats better than the single target one that lasts for 6.5 for 180 mana.  So I figure what the heck, I'll try it out for a while.<br />
<br />
Well it seemed like a short 16 minutes, so I timed it... It's not, it's 6.5 minutes (unadjusted.)  Lucy agrees.  So, question is, is the spell bugged, or the ingame description?<br />
<br />
Group damage shields (heck, ds's in general in PoP) are of questionable value at best, more of a convenience in knowing when it wears off, but with such a short duration this spell is simply not worth casting, unlike Ancient: Legacy of Blades which has the long duration.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>King Burgundy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use it all the time in LDON dungeons, depending on group composition.  One of my more common groups will typically be something like:  Paladin, Warrior, Shaman, Shaman, Druid(me), Monk.  Normally when my group is along those lines, everyone will be getting hit so it makes sense.<br />
<br />
I'll sometimes even use it when its less efficient just because it gives me a convenient timer to recast with.  <br />
<br />
But in single tank ldon groups its extremely silly to use it obviously.  And in PoP I don't think I ever used even the single target version.<br />
<br />
I don't have Ancient.  :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, would be interested to hear the answer to your actual question.  Spell would rock with a 16minute timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am getting lazy in my old age.  I have always been dead set against using group damage shields in favor of single target ones.  There have been reasons like mana efficiency, better single target DSs vs group, not wanting to waste buff slots, etc.  But it seems to me these days it makes no sense not to use it.  I mean its not really any more mana, the amount of the DS is exactly the same, and its a LOT more convenient.  I say its not more mana because when using single target I always time it for the tank by casting it on myself first then the tank.  It annoys me to have to make the tank call out for a DS every 6.5 minutes.  Its part of my job to keep up my buffs, IMO.  So, I always end up casting single target twice anyhow.  These days, I have plenty of mana, so that's not really a consideration, and I can be a little extravagant for the sake of convenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use the group one for two reasons.<br />
<br />
1)  Every point of damage counts towards the parties DPS no matter how insignifigant.  We don't slow LDoN mobs on normal mode so they hit faster and take more damage no matter who their hitting.  (Our guilds gear can handle the increased damage for most classes)<br />
<br />
2)  I know when its dropping and can recast immediately without someone having to tell me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glynna1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with Iegil on why I use it all the time. Unless there is a mage in the group, I keep it on the group and can easily tell when it starts to fade vs. using the single target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ladred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16811 (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16811)<br />
<br />
Use it all the time, no mana cost. Really wish they'd up the time on it though. Seems to wear off when I am least expecting it.<br />
<br />
From experience though, since the first group DS and group Regen spell that I can remember buffing when in exp groups. You cast two DS's per Regen. Might be a little longer with BoReplenish, I think I actually go 3 or 4 ds recasts before having to redo BoR.</div></div><hr />
