altogether, not a bad set. although im a lil concerned that it is an 8 piece and isnt that much better than malorne (when including the other three pieces). and whats with the gloves? comparable to more mp5 (there is no spirit on any of the pieces) why include haste?<br />

Does it help with spell casting?  IOW, does it reduce cast times?<br />
<br />
I know on a hunter haste reduces time between normal shots and reduces casting time of 2-3 of their &quot;special&quot; shots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know with mages, after a certain point of hit and spell damage they start going after haste since that is then one of the more effective ways to increase their DPS.  I would assume it is somewhat similar for Moonkin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">10-31-2007, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, spell haste reduces casting time which is good since two balance spells have cast times; starfire and wrath.<br />
<br />
Over all, it looks like a nice set. I still wonder, though, about the drops? There's always been balance gear reachable in teir gear (this gear is &quot;like&quot; teir gear). It's been drops that failed horribly for balance druids. Out of all the dungeons, there are very few balance specific drops. Hell, within the entire kara instance there's a 1:3 ratio for balance vs resto gear.<br />
<br />
The key reason I respeced back to resto is because I was feeling guilty in getting so much resto gear. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wondergiraff</div><div class="date">10-31-2007, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, they will be both drops and purchasable. so if after so long of not getting the drop, you can spend badges (which you can also get from kara) on the piece(s) you want.<br />
<br />
i just feel like a bit more mp5 would have been hot. guess ill have to do it with gems etc.</div></div><hr />

Similar to how 100 armor and 200 armour is a bigger difference than 1000 and 1100 armor.  What we need is a theorycrafter =)<br />
<br />
Haste also affects cyclone and hibernate ofc :&gt;  not to mention all the resto spells<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No clue about the spell haste thing, just want to correct the thing with armor.<br />
<br />
What you gain from 100 armor is always the same, no matter how much you already have. Yes, the reduction shown in the tooltip is increasing less with higher values, but that is misleading.<br />
<br />
This may not be easy to see, but a small calculation shows that.<br />
<br />
Some basic values to start with:<br />
<br />
AC  -&gt;  damage reduction (%)<br />
1a) 5229  -&gt;  33,12<br />
1b) 5599  -&gt;  34,65<br />
370 AC give 1,53% here<br />
<br />
2a) 23169  -&gt;  68,70<br />
2b) 23539  -&gt;  69,04<br />
370 AC give 0,34% here<br />
<br />
At this point it looks as if additional armor is less effecitve, the more you already have. But now to the calculation.<br />
<br />
Assuming I have 20000 HP and no healer (and no ImpLOTP, ...), how much physical damage is needed to kill me?<br />
<br />
The formula:<br />
damage recieved = damage done * (1 - reduction percentage)<br />
now transform that to get damage done<br />
damage done = damage recieved / (1 - reduction percentage)<br />
<br />
<br />
Using above AC numbers:<br />
<br />
damage done  -&gt;  reduction  -&gt;  damage recieved<br />
1a) 29904  -&gt;   9904 (29904 * 0,3312)  -&gt;  20000<br />
1b) 30604  -&gt;  10604 (30604 * 0,3465)  -&gt;  20000<br />
here the damage needed to kill me increases by 700 when the armor is increased by 370.<br />
<br />
2a) 63898  -&gt;  43897 (63898 * 0,6870)  -&gt;  20001<br />
2b) 64599  -&gt;  44599 (64599 * 0,6904)  -&gt;  20000<br />
now that is the interesting part. the increase of 370 in armor increases the needed amount of damage to kill me by 700 here as well.<br />
The odd point here and there is due to rounding. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, in reality, the point of armor needed to get from 29999 to 30000 is as effecitve as the point to get from 999 to 1000.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wondergiraff</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive been thinking about the haste rating. nearly every other caster gear drop (see cloth, trinket, etc.) from ZA has haste on it. one could stack quite a bit, while hopefully still maintaining high hit, and pump out some fast starfires. or you could even create a macro for wrath (should you get it down to a 1 sec cast before NG) that when you hit the GCD because of NG you switch to starfire. talk about burst dps. still, the 'moonkin' gear has very little, so we will still see a dps gap with other similarly geared casters.</div></div><hr />

15.x for 1% increase.<br />
This means it has a bigger advantage on starfire then on wrath.<br />
(Wrath doesn't improve anyway since it's already at the GCD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kosaghn</div><div class="date">11-25-2007, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've obtained quite a few pieces now.  My opinion so far:<br />
<br />
Gloves : Not going to get right now.  I can see it as effective in my starfire suit.  T4 gloves for trash and soloing and Attunman gloves for bosses seem superior.<br />
<br />
Chest:  Good for soloing and trash.  Would use this for optimal damage, and T4 (If I had it) for spell hit. I recommend it.<br />
<br />
Belt:  Key piece unless you want the crafted. Only thing you might want to swap it out for is some situational +spell hit gear.<br />
<br />
Helm:  This helm is not any better than the T4 helm, but it doesn't make you look like a nature loving tree-hugger.  I'm working on this now.<br />
<br />
Wrist: Key piece unless you want the crafted.  Another full time piece unless you feel you need some +spell hit gear.  Only 35 badges too.  <br />
<br />
Boots: 2 Red gem sockets???  +spell hit and leather???  These are better than Maiden's boots IMO.  Just get them.<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Equivelent to T5 for your boss mobs.  If you're in a raiding guild that can do 25 mans, don't bother with these.<br />
<br />
Idol:  This is getting nerfed.  It is going from a key piece to a waste of badges.<br />
<br />
Waist:  Another key piece unless you want your crafted.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I'm at SSC/TK content for reference.  (TK as in LootReaver)</div></div><hr />
