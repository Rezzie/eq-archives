<br />
The main difference between bear gear and cat gear is that with bear gear you are aiming to be really tough, whereas with cat gear you are aiming to hit really hard.<br />
<br />
For cat gear you would probably go for a lot of strength, agility, attack power, and crit chance.<br />
<br />
Agility is also good for bear because it gives you lots of dodge, however bears also need a lot of stamina and a lot of armor.<br />
<br />
Brutal Impact and Feral Charge are both great pvp talents.  Brutal impact is good because an extra 1 second of stun time can mean all the difference when ganking someone or running away from danger.  Feral Charge is great because you can use it to catch people trying to run away (with the WSG flag?), you can also use it to escape from danger.  I often find myself swamped with 5 enemies on me.  I pick a distant totem left by some careless shaman, charge it (moving me out of the angry cloud of horde), immedietely shift to cat form and use dash to run away fast.<br />
<br />
Although its expensive, the pvp trinket remains one of the best items for pvp imho.  At your level you are unlikely to have any other trinkets anyway :&gt;<br />

Unless you pick-up a few dungeon drops you are not likely to find any &quot;real&quot; tanking gear until you reach the Outlands.  I am currently leveling a Druid and I don't think I found more than 1 or 2 pieces of gear in the old world content (I did not PvP or run instances) that I would call &quot;tanking&quot; gear.  Though the random &quot;of the Monkey/Tiger/Bear/Beasts&quot; greens appear to be good tanking pieces.<br />
<br />
Even thru the first 20-30 quests I've done in the Outlands, I have yet to see a quest reward that I would consider a tanking item.  Most seem to be Kitty/Rogue or Restro/Moonkin.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to comment on this briefly.<br />
<br />
As a feral druid you are unlikely to be asked to be a main healer, but it _really_ marks you out as an awesome player to others if you do occasionally heal when it is needed.<br />
<br />
It's hard work watching your party's health bars at the same time as enemies, and it takes a while before you can do it comfortably.  But to truly fulfill your potential as a Feral Druid (a violent force of nature; a biological weapon), you should be prepared to do an emergency heal now and then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of a time when a feral druid might need to help heal:<br />
<br />
1.  The priest in your group dies.<br />
even a single healing touch on the main tank can make the difference between a wipe and everyone thanking you for saving the day<br />
<br />
2.  Several people in the group are very injured.<br />
Tranquility (a spell you will get later) heals everyone around you very quickly for a very large amount.  It can alter the course of a battle, doesn't require you to click on anyone to cast it, and it only takes 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing that really helps me to keep an eye on my party is to press SHIFT-V ingame.  This causes friendly health bars to be displayed on your UI - not very pretty, but it helps loads with targetting in the heat of battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
95% of your time can still be spent doing dps.  I know it's a pain to heal when there's a juicy mob in front of you, but this really is worth a try.  It's a great feeling when you avoid a wipe because of some fast and technical druiding, and everyone's /pats you and says what a nice and soft and fluffy druid you are.. :&gt;<br />
