What would I need to do to swap between Feral and Balance?  I've pretty much got some of the best tanking stuff in the game.  However I'm interesting in doing better in arenas.  I find feral just doesn't cut it.  I'm curious what gear and specs I should be looking at in a balance lay out?  Pretend I know nothing... I honestly don't know anything about playing a Balance druid.</div></div><hr />

I guess its time to level my mage up to 70.... get off my lazy butt.</div></div><hr />

But once the leveling game is over and the gearing game starts, we fall rapidly behind the other classes - once again (feral at least, I can't speak for other builds). But our biggest problem in the arenas appears to be the min/max mentality, and however you look at it teams at the top are better served bringing a pally or priest over a resto druid, and just about any class over a feral or balance druid.</div></div><hr />

Not saying were doomed but we're going to have to work that much harder to be as effective as some of the other classes. <br />
<br />
That being said Swiftmend Resto Druids seem to be best off for Arena. However Balance might only be useful for 5v5 imo.</div></div><hr />
