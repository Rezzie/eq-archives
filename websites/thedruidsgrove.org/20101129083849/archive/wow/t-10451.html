<br />
I curse that person for ever introducing me to that quest.  I thought it was a milk run, but I've failed at least four or five times so far.<br />
<br />
Generally I've had a party of at least three players, and I was the lowest level (18). The first mob is easily handled, but the second one draws our dude off the road to fight (pretty close to the destination). He dies, or the quest bearer dies, or both.<br />
<br />
Please give me some hints, before I go mad. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Word of advice: you have to do this quest as a group, but remember that *each* member must pick up the Horn of Awakening from the chest.<br />
<br />
Because when you arrive at the final destination, you need to give the horn to the Lady to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
I had to run all the way back to get the horn, and I barely made it back before the timer ran out. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ephrim</div><div class="date">04-26-2006, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy way to do this quest is when you come to the first group of Firbogs take it slow and stay to one side of the path. By doing this you can draw them out one at a time or kill all of them on one side of the road and don't walk into the aggro range of the others. To get past the Warlocks do the same thing but stay off the path on the right side. When they spawn they're well out of aggro range and poof.. you're done the quest with time to spare.<br />
