Not! (http://thottbot.com/q11566). The tank was pure good times with the Meat Grinder attack, and the Spare Suit was just a riot. The eyeball hanging out and flopping around while i was running was just icing on the cake. It had me lol'ing.<br />
<br />
what's yours?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a lot of interesting quests mixed in with good ole kill x and y quests. The one in Howling Fjord where you wear a Worg disguise is pretty fun...because you get to be a freaking Worg!</div></div><hr />

<br />
enjoyed the one last night in Icemist village where you are on the Kokron Windrider killing the Bat type creatures.<br />
<br />
and who could forget the one where u use that 'suit' to turn yourself into some funny looking greenish creature with a weird run and who runs with a white flag.<br />

It takes about 15 mins waiting for the darn event to start, but once it does....well worth the wait!</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of pure WHEEE! I have to give that one to the Zul'drak quest where you ride around on the Storm Giant smashing stuff and grabbing Storm Clouds.</div></div><hr />
