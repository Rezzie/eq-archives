Now blasted land has ZERO Gromsblood, and Swamp of Sorrows has a much smaller amount I'd say about 85% less probably even more. Meanwhile herbs have been going down in AH. Seems like I should just drop herbalism and take up engineering as a second tradeskill.</div></div><hr />

The second time was at around 4:30am when I get ready for work. There was blindweed there.. but I use to be able to get 10 or so in a full run.. I stripped the whole zone and only got 2, everything else was liferoot or some other one. I was looking at the blindweed item thread on thottbott, many of the people there said the same thing.</div></div><hr />
