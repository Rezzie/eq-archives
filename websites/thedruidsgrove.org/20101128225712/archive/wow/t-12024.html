My Crit chance was at 4.78 while tanking, and my party told me that was quite good.  I honestly, don't know.<br />
<br />
My Armour was at 12,800.  How is that?</div></div><hr />

I noticed that my melee crit in caster form is only 4.5%.  That is due to the fact that I don't have much weapon skill in that form.</div></div><hr />

That's probably it. You most likely had the Spell section open instead of the Melee one.<br />
 <br />
I have 26.41% crit rate in bear/cat at level 48.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Armor ::  Somewhere between 17-19k armor isn't overly too difficult. You don't need to have this much to start tanking kara / heroics (some of them) imo.<br />
<br />
HP :: Tanking 5mans after I hit 70 I was sitting at about 11k unbuffed in bear and I've tanked Kara once with only this much too XD<br />
<br />
Crit % :: I honestly do not really factor crit% into how I choose my tanking gear but for building up dodge and armor you should be loading up on agility which will increase your crit. It'll definitely be better than a prot warrior of about equal gear.<br />
<br />
oh btw get SotF (Survival of the Fittest - a feral talent) and load up on Clefthoof Set to hit your 415 defence which is our uncrittable cap (with SotF).</div></div><hr />
