<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">01-18-2006, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So. myself and another 22 druid are running though Ashenvale. We see the message Astranaar is under attack so we go to check it out. Its one level 60, nothing we can do to help so we go on our merry way. He sees us passing, 2shots us, we die etc. No problem there. Its a PvP server you get ganked, you deal, and if you are lucky you gank back.. <br />
<br />
Not this time though. He went back to killing guards, we rezzed and kept moving, this time in cat for the added run speed. He actually got on his mount, chased us all the way from astranaar to near the darkshore border just to kill us again. I understand when I enter contested territory I am always in danger of getting attacked. What I don't expect is a level 60 to chase me accross half the zone on his mount. Someone got picked on a little too much when they were a youngin I guess. So yes, I will get stronger, I have his name, I will get him back. <br />
<br />
Is it just me whining, in which case let me know and I'll shut up, or was this a little beyond the normal PvP atmosphere? As far as my understanding goes, he gets nothing. Nothing for the kill of us, nothing for killing the guards. NOTHING. Was he just bored and expected us to pop back on with our 60 alts and take him out or what?<br />

<br />
Yeah - it is very annoying especially when they kill the npc that you need to turn in your quest to.<br />
<br />
A thought that always crosses my mind when a high level player is in low level (especially Ashenvale) area is that they can't cut it on higher level players.  Seriously, a 60 should be able to do the same to level 45-56ish pretty easily.  There is no need to go into low level areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-18-2006, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This happened to me so many times in astranaar, that once I hit 48ish I extracted a small amount of revenge.  One day otw through stonetalon, I found a small horde town.  I thought I'd stealth in and have a look around.  I got in, and saw that the guards were only lv 45.  Proceeded to shred the flightmaster's face, then race out, only to turn around and come back in to take out guards.  <br />
<br />
I must say, killing the guards and npc's at that horde town was pretty satisfying.  A 35 shammy and 31 rogue attacked me, and at first I toyed with them, then killed them rather quickly.  They rezzd, and stood there looking at me while I /waved /laughed, then went back to killing their guards.  I then proceeded to kill a few more npc's / guards until 2 60s flew in.  I got into cheeta right quick and bolted out, and they caught me about 3/4 of the way out of the town.  They couldnt go anywhere b/c I had killed the flightmaster, so they, and the about 6 lv 30's that had rallied camped me for a while.  The 60s left after about 15 min, and I rezzd in the middle of 3 30's, regrow rejuv ng catform dashed out of there while /laughing.  <br />
<br />
I don't think I was too bastard to the hordies themselves, but the guards at the town got beat on good.  Ahh that was satisfying.  And I still occasionally get the urge to go raid splintertree with a rogue or two.</div></div><hr />

What I have a problem with is a level 60 taking the time to mount up and chase a level 22 halfway accross the zone. Its different if I attacked an ran or something. Sorta like going out of your way to kill a fly buzzing around food on someone else's table.<br />
<br />
An Atrus, I completely agree. It must be they can't cut it on equal level people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-18-2006, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I hate when hordies kill our flightmasters.  I thought about taking the moral high ground and leaving it alone, but that quickly succumbed to the &quot;well they did it to me, ill do it to them back&quot; school of thought.  :cool: <br />
<br />
One time I was in astranaar with my priest and in a legit, same lvl pvp battle with a UD mage, and was actually beating him, and halfway through the battle, a epic 60 orc warlock rides up on his epic felsteed and watches.  Right before I'm about to kill the mage, and am at about 1/4 health, the lock dismounts and shadowbolt crits me for like 5k.  Then he stands there and /laugh /chicken /no, etc while the mage eats my body.  They both then sit there and talk for about 15 min, all while killing various other lv 20-25 that happened to walk by.  <br />
<br />
Thats really lame about that 60 nyte.  I've had a lot of experiences like that.  I now make it a point to run around astranaar every now and then to check if there are ganking horde, or if a guildie says something, ill go there immediatley.</div></div><hr />

Basically no. To a level 25 a 60 is near immortal. Become a great player, then come back and find him. Thats all I can do. So thats my mission. Until I forget all about it months from now :sumo: <br />

If I do at all its usually a rogue or a shaman because they deserve to die anytime, all the time, no matter thier level. However I never ever never camp a low lvl area becuase it just seems stupid to me.<br />
<br />
 As someone else stated the people that usually do that arent really very good at same level pvp and they know it so they go kill what they can to feel better about themselves.<br />
<br />
 Just last night a 60 preist and a 60 warrior were in the wetlands killing everyone until myself (60 druid) and a 60 warrior showed up. We stomped their asses twice and they quickly went away.<br />
<br />
 Anyways, dont let it discourage you. It will happen again and again until you get high enough to defend yourself. Just wait until you venture into Stanglethorn Vale. That zone to me is the greatest test of your determination because at certain times it is an absolute ganking nightmare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">01-20-2006, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some people do it to draw out the higher levels.  I sometimes pick on Splintertree until the big boys show up then the real fun begins.  But I never kill players to the point of them not being able to get anyway.  Actually I NEVER attack low level players at all unless they attack me first.  I typicall harass the guards and continually kill them.  Call me a softie but after leveling to 60 you sorta know what it felt like on a PvP server so I just can't bring myself to enjoy doing what happened to me, to someone else.  When I get stuck in your kinda situation Nyte, I usually logon  to my 60 Druid and send the other guy packing.  They get the point then most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One overlooked but cool device that I use is a net-o-matic.  <br />
<br />
This thing allows me to (most of the time) net them to the ground for 10 seconds.  As long as they don't have huge ranged attacks you and another can easily take out a ?? because the net holds them down for 10 seconds.  During that 10 seconds unload everything you have at them and then laugh.<br />
<br />
Worst comes to worse and they break out and kill you - oh well.  I am sure they feel bad that they went to 5% health against a couple of people 20 levels below.</div></div><hr />

But later, when I'm not so young and weak. I'll randomly find him in a BG or something I'm sure and spend the rest of the match ruining his life. Healing his targets, rooting him far away from the HK zone. Whatever it takes. He won't remember, but I will. I'm petty like that.<br />

He camped my corpse, and when I ressed he killed me again.  At the time he was around 5 levels higher than me.  I too vowed that I would take my revenge..<br />
<br />
The next time I met him, we were both in our mid-40s in STV.  He had 2 friends along with him, and i had 4..  he got pretty nailed.<br />
<br />
Then, recently, I met him in Arathi Basin.  We are both 60 hunters now, however my gear is vastly superior to his.<br />
<br />
So I killed him.  Over, and over, and over again.  My hunter's dps is such that I can take down just about anyone in a couple of seconds.  Revenge is a dish best served cold...  with 3000 damage crits as seasoning. ;)<br />

There were like 7 of us in there hehehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-23-2006, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Little over a week ago, I was lvl 57 and say the alert &quot;Darkshore is under attack&quot;.  I wasn't far, so I rode in.  It's the same 60 Shammy that was attacking in Wetlands earlier when me and a few other 50s rode up and he rode off.<br />
<br />
He looked to have some decent gear, and 3 lvls on me so I wasn't eager to get my rear handed to me, when he asked for a duel.  I buffed up and accepted, and went stealth.  He dropped totem after totem ( hate those things ).  All said and done, he won but I had him down below 15% health.  He rode off, I rode off.  <br />
<br />
Last night, I'm in Felwood farming rep and I see the message &quot;Astranaar is under attack&quot; so I ride to Ashenvale and ask what's going on.  They say a 60 shammy is just lvling the place.  He was ?? to everyone there, but someone mentioned his name was &quot;ChuckG&quot; if that meant anything to me.  Oddly enough, it did.  this was the same Shammy and I owed him.<br />
<br />
I rode up, surprised him as he didn't have any totems out before he had moonfire, faerie fire and a bear bash on him.  He was mowed down pretty quickly, also with the assistance of some lower lvls.  <br />
<br />
He spawned and rode off.  I got on my epic mount and chased him down, waved, dismounted, rooted, faerie fire, moonfire, bear, charge, bash, and maul him down.<br />
<br />
He rezed again, tried to get the drop on me, but wasn't successful.  After that death he waited for his flag to wear off and rezed.  He waved, bowed, and healed.  As I rode back to Felwood someone said he flagged again, but they lost him as he was mounted and they were not.<br />
<br />
I am sure Chuck and I will meet again. :)</div></div><hr />

She (I think it's a she, it's pretty hard to tell in the tier 2 armor) chases us around on her epic mount, kills all the NPCs in town, /laughs, /spits, etc.  It normally takes about 2 or 3 epic'd 60s to take her down, plus it's a good chunk of honor for me.  Thankfully she can't gank me if I don't have my flag on!</div></div><hr />

Poppa's gotta lotta payback to deliva :texla: .<br />
<br />
I DO however feel that ganking can get excessive and completely out of hand, when a 60 chases a lowbie half way across a zone - that's a bit much.  But then, maybe he has a lotta payback to deliva too.  <br />

So me and some of my guildies made a run on SM today, even though I was level 28, and my buddy was 26. We get in, and guess what? I'm the healer. So I start healing everyone, burn through my mana, and I die. A little after me, a level 40 druid in our party dies as well, and starts cussing me out. Because my mana ran out? Apparently so. Later on, gloves drop... Good gloves. Gloves for my next level. But... it's a BoP, and per my guild rules, I pass. But he greeds it... and gets it. I get slightly mad, and ask him why he did it. Apparently to disenchant it. I ask why he didn't pass on a BoP, and then he goes on to say that it's not soulbound. And now my entire guild is mad at me.<br />

Regarding the shammies totem issue, they are overpowered, they need to be balanced down, of course they would whine but leaving a completely non-sense feature (totems not getting hit by aoe or swipe etc...) in the game just to keep shammies from whining is much worst imho!!!<br />
