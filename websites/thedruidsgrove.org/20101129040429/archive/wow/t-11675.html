<br />
First off, Blizzard has announced a new RTS, Warcraft: Heroes of Azeroth (WHoA) (http://www.blizzard.com/whoa/).  Relive the events leading up to World of Warcraft!<br />
<br />
Next, Blizzard has introduced a new item, the Tinfoil Hat (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/tinfoilhat.xml).  This awesome item allows you to remain hidden from other players and the Armory site.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard has released a chart detailing the prerequisites (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/btattunement/) for entering the Black Temple, which is being released in the 2.1 patch.  Looks pretty reasonable, even for non-raiders.<br />
<br />
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
<br />
Finally, the most amazing news released today...<br />
April Fool's Day!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the chart detailing the prerequisites for entering the Black Temple, about time.<br />
<br />
The tin foil hat is a joke.<br />
<br />
The armoury is the best thing yet, especially for wasting work hours trying to compare new and possible gear upgrades and to compare with fellow guildies and their gear choices.<br />
