<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">11-22-2007, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, putting the life of a MT/DPS behind me for awhile (might try raiding again someday /shrug), I'm going Resto PvP on Tuesday. But, I'm torn between two specs. I'm leaning towards 8/11/42, but 11/11/39 looks tasty...<br />
<br />
8/11/42 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0zjZVMhoZVcIxcq0xsx)<br />
<br />
11/11/39 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0zjMzZVMhoZVcIxcq0hsL)<br />
<br />
In both of those builds, the points spent in Nature's Focus and Improved Regrowth are a toss-up; having never done arena as resto, I'm not sure which one is more optimal, but I'd adjust the two as necessary once I get into it.<br />
<br />
I will be arena'ing with a AR/Prep/Hemo mace rogue for 2v2, and said rogue and either a Feral (most likely), or a Shadow Priest, SL/SL Warlock, and Frost Mage, if said feral does not join us, for 3v3.<br />
<br />
The 8/11/42 appeases me most, but I'm entertaining the notion of doing some offense to help my rogue, and Insect Swarm is the perfect way to do that. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

The Resto in my 3v3 has that build and he loves it. If you go for the other build I'd suggest putting 2 more points in it to get Nature's Reach. The increase in range is really useful for your crowd control spells.<br />
<br />
But I'd move 2 points from Empowered Rejuvination to Nature's Focus in any case. HoTs are very nice in the arena, but when you need that big heal, not getting interrupted is more valuable than a few percent more +healing IMO.</div></div><hr />

The only reason I'm hesitant about 11/11/39 is due to the fact I'd lose a point in Empowered Rejuvenation. Regrowth is good for quick healing, but the reason Resto Druids are so strong in 2v2 and 3v3 is due to HoTs. Lifebloom and Rejuv, with the occasional Swiftmend and sometimes Regrowth, is what makes them so strong. There's rarely any cast bars, and they can kite with Travel form while casting heals.<br />
<br />
It comes down to whether I'd want less interruption on Regrowth, or get a bigger chance for it to crit; I plan on keeping at least 4 points in Empowered Rejuvenation, if not 5. It's just too sexy for the method of healing.</div></div><hr />

You could always go 4 and 4 to be middle of the road but if you know how to avoid getting interrupted by both melee and spellcasters/ranged, you shouldn't have to rely on a talent to get your heals off.<br />
<br />
Another perspective is that your individual skill and smart positioning will be able to make up for the spell interrupts whereas no matter how good you are, you won't magically heal for more on your HoTs ;D<br />
<br />
Happy Arena'ing~</div></div><hr />

That's basically what I have surmised. I figured the extra offense would be nice, but it's hard to tell how much I'd need the 4% more bonus healing--which I can't make else upwhere. And yeah, I planned on 3/5 nature's focus because I figured I could rely on myself to keep distance and kite effectively.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I'll go 8/11/42.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses, by the way--I really appreciate them; this is what I'm dedicating my WoW and main to, after spending nearly a year perfecting being a feral MT/DPS. It feels odd. x.x</div></div><hr />
