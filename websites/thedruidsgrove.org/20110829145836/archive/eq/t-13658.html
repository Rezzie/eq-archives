Drops in the bazaar for about 2Kpp :)<br />
<br />
Maxes as you learn all the non-player-race languages, doable in short order with a partner and a hotkey :)<br />

Or 600-800pp (Cazic Server) last I checked....this maxed plus slipgear was a cheap, quick and easy upgrade for me.<br />

Like a lot of similar items that wind up flooding the bazaar for some reason, and give you no reason not to buy them at that price, I have NO idea where they actually drop, LOL.<br />

I play on TEST, we average about 10 traders up at any one time. I have seen heartstone for sale, dont recall price.  Well, back to HoH, still trying to get PoT9 and Swarm.  thx for replies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a decent DoN charm (Blessed Reviver's Charm, something like that).  If you don't have the cash to buy crystals (assuming they are available on test), you could solo some DoNs that are totally kitable.  You need three to get the missions, but I'm sure you could find two people to group with you long enough to start the mission.<br />
<br />
Also, the DoN charm has two aug slots, so you could put both LDoN and Slipgear's on it.<br />

Acceptable stats, 50% of the time, and you don't need to work languages :)</div></div><hr />
