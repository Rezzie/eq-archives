 <br />
I dont seem to have an upgrade to my Complete heal type spell - Karanas Renewal (Lev 64)<br />
 <br />
Now I am currently 75 (just about to ding 76 after i get just a few more AA)<br />
 <br />
My Heal spells to choose from are - <br />
 <br />
Cheal - Karanas Renewal<br />
Quick heal - Pure Life or Adrenaline Surge<br />
Group heal - Lunar Light<br />
 <br />
Now can someone point out what I may be missing or is our CHeal at level 75...  11 levels Old????<br />
 <br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

And I thank the devs for obsoleting our usefulness on a spam snorefest chain.  Hopefully clerics will see that day soon as well.</div></div><hr />

Which is pretty damn unrealistic. When a cleric casts a &quot;complete heal&quot; on a high-level warrior and his HP bar moves from 25% to 75% that's pretty darn lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is why clerics now have the Promised Renewal/Restoration spells.  10 second cast is now 0.25 seconds.  This has allowed clerics huge gains in healing flexibility, dps, and potential fun.<br />
<br />
It does add to the problem, imo, of druid being able to in no manner heal at 75% of a cleric.  PR, plus HoT, plus blast heals is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than what we can bring to the table.  Even before group heals.  No way that'll be substantially changed before next expansion though, I'm guessing :(.</div></div><hr />
