<br />
I just started WoW, lvl 19 Druid LW/Skin. I have several higher level friends that if I told them what to save for me they would rather than vendor sell. Thotbot shows most them but its not in a user friendly list so I was wondering if such a list exists?<br />
<br />
Items I am talking about are:<br />
<br />
Small Lustrous Pearl<br />
Long Tail Feather<br />
Moss Agate<br />
Iridescent Pearl<br />
Jade <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will need this in order to complete some LW quest. It's a semi-rare drop from trolls, found in some chest in STV, and sometimes picked with purple lotus. <br />
<br />
on my server it sells for at least 1.5 gold per wildvine. Not sure what price on your server or if its as hard to come by, but be on the look out, you will need.</div></div><hr />

I pretty much gave up on it, once my LW had increased to a certain level (286 here), and focus on Wicked Leather stuff now that I can, until my last 10 point grind.</div></div><hr />

I have that list on the wall above my pc which makes for an excellent quick reference for when I am offloading loot to vendors and at AH ... it has saved me many a time from parting with important ingredients which I now simply put aside in the bank until I get the LW recipe to make the item concerned. I would strongly recommend you making a similar list...it's worth the small amount of effort needed.<br />
<br />
Ps ... I am often unconvinced that LW was the right choice for me ... skinning yes, but LW seems to cost me more than I make...esp when items I make don't sell first or second time and I end up losing heaps of $$$ in deposits to the AH. And I seldom make the gear I wear because it's not the spec I need (ie ...of the Eagle) or whatever. Sorry if this is off topic but I wonder wot other's views of LW is? I will look at other threads 2 see if this has already been discussed. Cheerz.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hertzsae</div><div class="date">09-06-2005, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of compiling a list, get the auctioneer addon http://auctioneeraddon.com/ (hosted at sourceforge).  It's made to keep track of the price you can get for items, but I find the most useful feature is that it tells you what profession uses each item when you mouse over it.  It's very nice to be able to send items to my friends without having to ask if anyone needs something.  So if you notice an item is used in leatherworking, then just keep it.<br />
<br />
As far as leatherworking as a profession, I'd have to agree that it's hardly worth it, but I think most professions feel that way when they hit 60.  I can't even make money off devilsaur as there is too much competion now.  It amazes me that people will sell the pants for less then the leather sells for.  When I asked why they would take a loss, they replied that they farmed the leather themselves, therefor, they were making money.  Apparently they never thought about just selling the leather, because at their prices they could make more money.</div></div><hr />

Got it and it's great!  I checked it out for the reason you said, to see what things I pick up can be used by me.  But now that I have it I think I will start using the AH.<br />
<br />
I never wanted to be bothered before to try to know what prices on the AH are compared to the NPCs.  This tool makes it easy.</div></div><hr />
