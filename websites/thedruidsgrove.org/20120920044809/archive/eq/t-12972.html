<br />
I've hit a bit of a roadblock with my aa's.  I have around 340 atm, but can't decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
Some background - I raid 3 times a week - combination of 1.5's, OOW targets for glowing runes and we're almost elemental on our way to Time.  I group most days and split my time between MH and DPS.<br />
<br />
The following are some thing I think would probably be useful, but I'm open to suggestions that aren't on this list as well:<br />
1.) Planar Power 1-5<br />
2.) Secondary Forte<br />
3.) Spirit of the Grove 1-3<br />
4.) Convergence of Spirits (after #3 obviously)<br />
5.) Increasing my saves (Magic, Poison and Disease need the most work)<br />
7.) Resplendent cure 1-3<br />
8.) Spell Casting Subtlety 1-3<br />
9.) Natural Durability 1-3 (Magelo says I'd get around 500hps from this)<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo:<br />

Thanks for any suggestions you can give me.  :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I would get planar power next, followed by grove and resplendent.<br />
 <br />
Natural dur should rank pretty high on that list too.</div></div><hr />

PP is quick and easy, hence first.  Gain a little more HP, some more mana and overall add some sturdiness to your toon.  SCS is one of the best AA's a healing OR nuking druid can get.  Less aggro you pull, the longer you live, the more you can heal and nuke.  ND3 is fairly cheap and since you raid, your HPs keep you alive.  Resp Cure and Grove can be done in either order really, but both are very handy ulitity AA's.  Secondary Forte is nice for that extra innate mana pres (specially since you heal and nuke).  Convergence... bleh steals grove timer.  Innate saves are nice but more something I consider for the high-end game, where resisting most spells is rare and every last save counts even more.<br />
 <br />
Just my 2cp!</div></div><hr />

The thing with Both Resists, and Secondary Forte is that while useful, you need to be in serious lack of resists to get these before something else.<br />
<br />
Since your raiding Elemental Planes, and Soon time - How often you MGB Heal will tell you when to get Grove finished out.  The downside of this, is until you do Convergance of Spirits remain locked - and its a awesome heal.<br />
<br />
As such I would probly do Planar Power First, then SCS.<br />
<br />
From there I would either do ND or Grove - depending again on how much you MGB heal.<br />

<br />
I spent the aa's on planar power 1-5 tonight.  I'll do SCS, ND then sotg next.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your feedback.  I'll push the saves off until I'm doing harder raid content or until I don't have much else to buy.</div></div><hr />
