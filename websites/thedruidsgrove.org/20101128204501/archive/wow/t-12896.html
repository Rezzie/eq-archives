...it is sort of neat.  Our lvl 80 cat DPS sequence is way more difficult that it is today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did read someone thought the boss armor reduction might be a bit high.  Should be 26%, whereas he has it at 30%????</div></div><hr />

I mean is this using what type of gear?  I'd assume we couldn't do 4.6k DPS starting in Naxx.  That seems obscenely high.<br />
<br />
Ok I see it now... wow 9600 AP... that's really high.  I could see having 5-7k starting Naxx though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I guess this would be after Naxx?  Or do the T7 pieces drop from more than one instance?<br />
<br />
I've tried but I can't get above 3K DPS, but then I haven't focused really hard keeping up all three Debuffs/DoTs and remembering to use TF and Berserk.<br />
<br />
While the DPS number is nice, the real goal is to see if you can keep Rip, Rake, Mangle and SR with a 90+% up time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow that's DPS you can do after Naxx??? Geez...<br />
<br />
If I can do taht kind of DPS I'm going back to solo Kara just for giggles.</div></div><hr />

I honestly didn't know what shred looked like as I use it as part of a prowl, pounce, shred macro.</div></div><hr />
