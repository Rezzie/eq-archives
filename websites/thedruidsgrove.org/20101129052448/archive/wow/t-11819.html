<br />
Just wondering if anyone have seen our Night-Elf druid &quot;Spoh&quot; lately?<br />
<br />
He really should release another PvP video since the TBC release.<br />
I saw his last one &quot;Believe&quot; , and I have yet to see a druid with his skills and knowledge..<br />
<br />
Someone on the US server, c'mon post a thread in the forums saying that he should make a new one :D<br />
<br />
Anyone agree?</div></div><hr />

Or even fought him as he is on alakir like you :)?<br />

Feragho hasn't release anything new has he? Still same old same old?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know if he's back though , could be quite interesting seeing some movies after TBC with the well known druids..<br />
<br />
Thinking about making one myself soon. Gathering some clips now, but have to find out who to talk to regarding editing :D<br />
<br />
Maybe just send a external harddrive to my friend or sumtn'!</div></div><hr />

I've been pretty much only playing my lock for the past month or so on Blackrock, and I cant stand rogues now.  Every bg I am in, whereas they used to pick targets other than me, they now come straight at me.  And its damn hard to kill something that, as soon as I have half a second out of stunlock to QQcoil and dot, becomes next to immune to dots and magic for 5 sec while he stabs me in the face.  CLoS is really bastard.<br />
<br />
But I guess rogues needed something to make them into a good pvp class........... &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
*edit: i can still take rogues 1v1 cause I'm Soul Link demonology, but rather than being about a 90% win chance, its more like 40-50%.  QQ :P</div></div><hr />

My best friend (and arena soulmate) plays a lock so I know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
But let's be frank.. summer '06 the BG/PvP-scene was totally SWAMPED with locks. It was just ridiculous. I have several screenshots of PuG WSG-teams with 15 undead locks and nothing else.. everyone played them just because they where so uber and had no nemesis whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Warlocks needed a nemesis IMO. And I'm not just saying this because I have a rogue main.. I'm trying to be neutral.. and tbh.. rogues are still a melee class that wears leather and have little to medium HP-pool at average. And a rogues pretty much needs to get initiative in a fight or he/she is just fighting at 75% at best.. and if a skilled hunter or Ret-pally cathes a rogue of guard.. it's a real sweatshop just to survive.<br />
<br />
My best tip when fighting a rogue: Summon your succubus. Be affliction with instant Howl (no, demonology just makes you longer to kill, and the felguard is a joke that can be blinded). Still.. whatever you do, the fight will always be in the rogues favour.. it's a rock-paper-scissors-thingie. :(<br />
<br />
A rogue/lock 2v2 arena combo is really good though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree with ya goa.  I left my lock at the 49 bracket and ab / wsg'd a ton and was absolutley a god.  Unkillable, except for a couple hunters.<br />
<br />
My strat against rogues at 70 basically is, being demo, to death coil as soon as possible and either insta summon a succy to seduce him or insta summon a voidwalker in the 1 or 2 seconds hes runnign away.  <br />
<br />
VW works best for me, depending on the rogue ofc, cause I can sac while stunned.  Plus he gives me an additional -10% dmg takenwhile he is out (with soul link total dmg reduced by 30%), allowing me to not take insane dmg while stunlocked if I want to wait for the sac until he hits ClOS.  When he hits CloS, I'll sac the vw for a 3k hp shield.  CloS only lasts 5 sec iirc (1min cd, not sure if prep works with it), so I'll just sit there and wand / sword the rogue while my shield sucks up all the dmg.  After CloS is down, I'll have enough time left on the shield usually to fear, redot and gg.  If I get jumped and they are good with timing a kick, or just get some wicked crits, I'm done.  <br />
<br />
I transfered my warlock a few months back to Blackrock to play with a RL friend who plays a troll rogue / be pally.  We are going to get a 2man rogue warlock arena team going.  I'm kind of torn about going Affliction (UA is godly for those cleanse happy pally / priests in arenas), and staying demo / destruction so that I can survive somewhat and be able to instasummon whatever pet is most appropriate for the team im against, and still put out good damage (demonic knowledge).(oh, and we are constantly looking for a tank for 5 mans when not pvp'ing /nudge trixtaa)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty impressed at your neutrality on the topic tbh goa.  Most people see a lock qq comment and go nuts with the NERFZOR OMFG OP NUBS rants :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">06-13-2007, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe cool strat you got going there with the VW and stuff.. I have to admit I don't see that strat much (almost never tbh). <br />
<br />
I bet you'll be a surprise for other rogues in the 2v2 scene. :)<br />
<br />
..and no, prep doesn't reset CloS - it would be way to imba imo - casters have enough problems with CloS as it is (Blind is another thing that doesnt resets with prep as that would also screw up arena fights too much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">06-15-2007, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh.  VW strat doesn't work all the time, and quite honestly absolutley sucks for dmg.  But the shield is really nice imo.  I'd probably be better off with a succy a lot of the time.  <br />
<br />
Glad to hear prep doesn't affect CloS or Blind.  Was that recently nerfed?  I have a 37 rogue, and I thought that I remembered the tooltip for prep in the subtelty tree saying it reset all cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

They nerf it first week Arena was out. It was too good for the arena, and everyone pretty much agreed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know how many others know (I assume it's recent, day or so ago), but Azgaz has released his fifth video (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=41727). I haven't watched all of it (sleepy), but the Battleground clips were awesome. It really makes me wish I had the full Gladiator set (with complementary PvP epics) and could take the damage he does, while still killing. Saw some of his 2v2 before I closed it (for now), and it was entertaining to watch; they made the 2v2 druid team very possible due to crazy-good timing on feral charge, maim, pounce, and cyclone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">06-17-2007, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Veriden for this information... I have been waiting for this vid for a very long time :)<br />
<br />
/hug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">06-18-2007, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just watched the movie, and no doubt - azgaz has some good skills... <br />
Unfortunatley I have never met him in the BGs yet, but I want to.<br />
<br />
But I really think in this video, he shows more what you can do with good gear than good skills... apart from the 2v2 arena wich I was really impressed about...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">06-18-2007, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you are somehow right Brekster, he showed less skill in this video then in the previous ones. Try to download the first 4 videos, that are a bit better imho, becouse he was a hybrid build with more available tactics then now as full feral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">06-18-2007, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I've watched all his videos..(thats how I could comment on what I said) and... He shows more &quot;skill&quot; in those videos..<br />
<br />
Full Glad w/mace and full PVP you get so much HP and Resi. that you can basicly outlast every opponent, who doesn't have that gear.<br />
You rearly get critted, when you do get critted these are low, and well.. ****loads of HP...<br />
<br />
He does good DMG though, and some fight is very good (at LM in AB e.g) where he comes up with loads of ppl...<br />
<br />
Still,<br />
I think the skill is not superb, the gear is...<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: bad english, can't be bothered to fix (at work)<br />
Entertaining video though</div></div><hr />
