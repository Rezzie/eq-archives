<br />
<br />
TB is not a problem,  I can turn in a donation of wool, and I have clara's pendant under elder rise.<br />
<br />
<br />
UC is.  All I have available is the cat/bear quests given in TM, because I am done entirely with Hillsbrad.  It took me an entire night too. =)  So, where should I get some quests?</div></div><hr />

What does reputation do, anyway.  Aside from exalted = mounts.</div></div><hr />

I think its a 10% bonus, ie buy for 90%, sell for 110% of normal. I might be wrong about the percentage though.<br />
<br />
I also think that neutral guards will not come to your aid, but that could just be my imagination.<br />

Will or will not aid you, Nyte?  On Gorefiend, when I am in Gadgetztan, all the time these horde guys will attack us and not get murdered by the &quot;neutral&quot; town gaurds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">10-28-2005, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, neutral. I could be wrong, but usually the guards that are neutral will not help you. Nor will they attack you unless you attack them. Same probably goes for the others. As long as they take no hostile action toward the guard, then the guard will leave them alone.<br />

Goblin bouncers will attack anyone that pvp's in their towns.  PvP distracts their customers from the important business of spending money and goblins don't like having thier business interupted.  The goblins don't care if you were the attacker or the attackie if they see you engaged in battle (within their agro range) they will attack you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhmm....why do you need timbermaw reputation to explore Felwood?  You can run there using the road from Ashenvale.  However, at level 24, any mob in Felwood (most of which are NOT on Timbermaw faction) will kill you in about 5 hits.</div></div><hr />

Once you are the appropriate level to explore Fellwood you can get there easily and improve the faction until then there's nothing you can do.</div></div><hr />

I just used entangle A LOT (it worked sometimes!).  And about 50,000 heal pots and speed potions.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much you need to be in your 40's to get the faction unless you have someone higher lvl helping you.</div></div><hr />
