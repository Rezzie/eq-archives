<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on collected posts from http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13349 and my own personal experiances.<br />
<br />
Mission Giver:  Ao the Fourth Born<br />
Zone:  Arcstone, Isle of Spirits<br />
<br />
First Mission: The Libary<br />
<br />
Zone into Skylance Tower (Run onto the Portal on the bridge which ends just before it)<br />
<br />
You need to find your way to the Libary, You can speak with Ao's Assisant, and follow his Drake Fimilar, or you can simply take the ramp to the first Portal on your left.<br />
<br />
The Libary is filled with Scrykin.  <br />
<br />
All Scykin have the following two AEs:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.htm...18&amp;source=Test (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8618&amp;source=Test)  10 percent snare<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.htm...12&amp;source=Test (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8612&amp;source=Test) 30 percent melee slow<br />
<br />
The Scykin hit around 1400 and are fairly MR.  They AE Often.  Resplendant 3 with Quicked Curing is a huge help as the slow has no counters.<br />
<br />
When you walk through the portal, you can aggro upto 3 esp if you fight them at the Portal.  As it has been posted elsewhere it is in your best interests to charge through the portal and fall down a story (appox 400 damage fall) and land in the middle of a bunch of non-kos Scykin.<br />
<br />
Talk with Student Joban and get a task update to collect two halves of a symbol given to two Assisants.<br />
<br />
Clear up the Ramp (you can pull the other Scykin to the bottom and the non-kos ones will not assist) until you can make it back to the portal without aggro. (there is no reason to pull/kill the indifferant ones).<br />
<br />
Now, with the Portal at your back, the Assistant on the Right Platform should be first.  Clear his ramp and charge him in place.  Every 15/20 percent or so he will summon a very low hp book to assist him.  These hit 800.  We found it effective to have the group kill them while the MA offtanked the named.  Once dead, loot Symbol.<br />
<br />
Go back down to the Portal and clear the Left platform ramp of roamers.  This assisant hits weaker then the previous one, but summons Scykin Bookworms (1400 hitters, both AEs) at short timed intervals while aggro.  You need to Burn him down.  These may aggro you, but should not all aggro you at once.<br />
<br />
Kill the Bookworms you need to to clear to the back platform.  Hand both halves of the Symbol to the Libarian and recieve The Codex Artifice (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36142) you need.<br />
<br />
Bring the Book back to Ao the Fourth in Arcstone for mission completion and a chest spawn.<br />
<br />
Mission Two:  The Oubliette<br />
<br />
Get this mission from Ao the Fourth and zone into Skylance as per mission 1.<br />
<br />
This time the Portal you need is on the first floor, to the Left of the zone in.  Move through that portal (its safe).<br />
<br />
You are now in a dungeon/basement area.  Your goal is to move from room to room opening eggs until you locate the correct one.<br />
<br />
There are lots of stonemites per room.  They have appox 3k hitpoints so you can pull several at once and AE them, etc.  They're are however a few 70/71 mobs that roam the basement, with normal hit range/hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Note:  The Evil Eye Models cast Blinding Blink http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8594&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
When you open an Egg, and it is not the correct one, a Unformed Scykin spawns (typical 70/71 trash mob).<br />
<br />
Repeat this process till your task updates.<br />
<br />
The person who was opening Eggs, should now have The Prototype Egg of Tallongast (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36143) in their Inventory.<br />
<br />
Head Back to Arcstone and give the Egg to Ao.  This completes the Task and spawns a chest.<br />
<br />
Mission 3:  The Labatory<br />
<br />
Recieve Misision from Ao and zone into Skylance.<br />
<br />
This time the portal inside Skylance you want is the second one on the Ramp (next portal past the libary)<br />
<br />
You are now in a room with a table and 4 platforms on the upper area.<br />
<br />
The person who requested the Mission got The Incubated Egg of Tallongast (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36145).  That person needs to place the egg on cursor, stand near the table and hit 'U'<br />
<br />
This places the Egg on the Table.  This spawns  Lab Assisants (1400 Hitters, typical Scrykin AEs) on the upper level, you will want to kill these.<br />
<br />
You are now going to get an E-Mote in Red Text (like the Yxxta Riddle)<br />
<br />
The Riddle Answers are here:<br />
<br />
- The gaze-O-rama should be used to confer the egg with greater sight = <br />
click: WEST console <br />
 <br />
- Use the trans-injector to infuse the essence of magic into the egg = <br />
click: NORTH console <br />
 <br />
- A good dose of ethereal goo needs to be applied next = <br />
click: EAST console <br />
 <br />
- Switch on the hyper-manipulator to align the proteins into their proper sequence = <br />
click: SOUTH console <br />
 <br />
- From the ether, call out the spirits willing to aid you in this experiment = <br />
click: EAST equipment <br />
 <br />
- The dispenser has the next critical component = <br />
click: SOUTH equipment <br />
 <br />
- Distill the magical spirits into their purest form = <br />
click: WEST equipment <br />
 <br />
- Remove the necrotic portion of the tissue = <br />
click: NORTH equipment<br />
<br />
Now, every time you click the right item, another Lab Assisant Will spawn.  I recommand killing it while your waiting for the computer to let you enter the next command (there is a delay on how fast you can win the riddle, just like Yxxta).<br />
<br />
However, if you screw up, a 70ish Zombie spawns near the table and will aggro you.  You also restart the riddle from the begining.<br />
<br />
Once you do all 7, I would make sure everyone is buffed and has mana.  When you click the 8th (final) command the named will spawn on the Table and attack.<br />
<br />
The Named hits around 2100 and has a moderate amount of hitpoints.  The named also will drop the mission loot (IE chest drop)<br />
<br />
When you kill him two things happen, the first is Everyone in the Group recieves a Tarnished Chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36144) in their inventory.<br />
<br />
Secondly the Task updates with an Optional Part, which is bring the Tarnished Chime to Ao the Fourth Born in Arcstone.  You want to do this, so do NOT leave task.<br />
<br />
Handing the Tarnished Chime to Ao the Fourth Born results in you getting back a Harmonic Chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84159).  This chime is used in your Theater of Blood Access Quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">03-07-2006, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The flags from these missions seem to be bugged.  I recommend doing this arc in this order (assuming it's a posibility):<br />
 <br />
1) Mission Three: The Labatory<br />
2) Mission One: The Libary<br />
3) Mission Two: The Oubliette<br />
 <br />
If you don't do it in that order, you'll move likely need to do 1 and 2 over again to be able to turn in the tarnished chime.<br />
 <br />
I'm posting this on 3/4, if it's a patch that fixes this disregard it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These missions are very buggy.  You MUST make sure everyone is in Arcstone when you do the final turn-ins for EACH mission.  If you do not allow all members of the group to get to Arcstone (zone out of Skylance) those people will have to do it again.  Has nothing to do with order that I've seen, I had to do mission 1, 4 times... mission 3, 3 times... mission 2, 2-3 times lol.  It 100% is if you don't let someone get to Arcstone before doing the final turn-ins for the missions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we had 2 deaths on the boss, the first person got their task update and chime at their bindpoint. the 2nd person was still zoning and didnt get anything until he was rezzed back into the zone. everyone got flagged.</div></div><hr />

It was a exploit where you could complete the mission without killing mobs,  the exploit mechanics may still work but you will get aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before all you had to do was nuke eggs in each room each time u destroy an egg it pops more mobs so its harder to target them, dont get near roaming mobs near the ramp. Not sure if this still works. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinyenya</div><div class="date">05-08-2006, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok i spent 7 count them 7 hours today completing Skylance Arc 1-3 and got spell Moonshadow as well as all flags, chime etc.<br />
<br />
From what i could tell the following items are NOT in the write up and we found some things out the hard way.<br />
<br />
1- Library-Actually not Difficult if done CORRECTLY as per what the original write up by Fenier states.  However dont go down like others are saying.  When u enter the room make a HARD RIGHT, clear all wanderers should be a total of 4.  Have someone go down and hail the guy in the bottom come back up have group head to first assistant and slowly dps him down.  every 15-20 percent as write up states a book will come alive.   Have the tank or MA NON DPS AGGRO the named and have everyone cept the person holding aggro on named kill the book, then switch back to assistant till next book comes alive rinse and repeat this a maximum of 4 times.  At the end burn him down u get first half. <br />
<br />
Now the fun part  have everyone ready for second assistant we killed him in exactly 46 seconds with group make up of Bard, Druid, Pally, Shaman, Ranger, necro, everyone all out frigging dpsed him and he was dead.  we figured ok NO AddS RIGHT.. WRONG WRONG WRONG.  Here came 4 bookworms charging.  The key to this is once the assistant is dead loot the 2nd piece and EVAC your group out.  Now everyone run back in and wait at portal, yes the book worms are still up and you are kos invis or not but they will not aggro you unless u go to them but u can easily run to Head Librarian by making a left instead of a right turn in both pieces and get book, u can then all zone out to AO AND BAM u done.<br />
<br />
2-OBLIQUE (spelling)  PIECE OF FRIGGING CAKE.  Zone in everyone stay in one spot have bard pull just one and they all come a running from one area, make sure no 70's or wanderes are with the pull or it can get nasty.  Then have Pally AE group its a great AGGRO holder, then druid AE the damn things to death with ICE AE.  Continue to do this at Zone in, YES they respawn.  During this time u will have 1-2 large level 69 or 70 worms possibly 71 worms in the area too they are mezzable but killable with a hella lot of hps.  Kill them one at a time its easier dont pull a RAMBO.  Then have the tank go down and kill one egg at a time.  Pull mob that pops up to top with you all to avoid wanderers and repops.  Continue to do this until u get the egg with no pop, (for us this happened to be a small egg not a big one)(coincidence?)the person who spawned the egg will get the item.  Zone out u all done upon turn in.<br />
<br />
3- LABORATORY- PAIN IN THE ARSE-  This was easy but a pain if you dont know what to expect.  At certain intervals you WILL get more than one attendant that spawns even when u go to the correct console or Equipmen table.  We figured they are on a timer.  However on consoles or equipment 4 and 5 we got 2-3 adds and not one.  Bard was able to mezz them but had a lot of resists.  You must time these correctly or it can get nasty as we found out the first time and were more prepared the second time which we won.  It does not take a few minutes for the attendant to spawn once u hit the console or equipment table.  it is immediate spawn so make sure someone has aggro on them.  What is in intervals is the random pops of additional attendants we figured this to be about 7-8 minutes apart.  Once u get the 7th one done and click the 8th one the named spawns.  Make sure you have enough time to kill him without additional respawns of the attendants.  Finish up zone out fast cause YES even though named is dead the respawns of attendants still occurs.  Zone out turn in OULA u done.<br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE:  Each individual group will have a different make-up, this was based upon 7 hours of killing and learning the ways of this Arc progression.  Different people may have different experiences but this is what happened as of 5/7/2006.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">05-08-2006, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the lab - <br />
-print out the emote guide you find here at druids' grove.<br />
-get a pencil / pen<br />
-mark off the emotes you complete as you get them<br />
 <br />
Each time you touch a correct trigger you will get 1 mob.  The three attendants around the room that you spawned initially also each respawn at regular intervals, so the slower you kill them in the beginning, the more spaced out they will come.  I believe they repop every 15 minutes or so, we were getting 1 every 5 minutes, roughly, the last time I did this.  <br />
 <br />
The reason it sometimes looks like you are getting 2 or 3 or 4 mobs is because those static respawns are just happening to correspond with when you are making the clicks for the emotes.</div></div><hr />
