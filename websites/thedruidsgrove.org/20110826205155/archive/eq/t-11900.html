<br />
Our guild has been in here going on 2mnths now and only one pattern has dropped, we clear through to and including Quarm once each week. <br />
<br />
Is it best to hang in there and try to get the Time Tunic or are there alternatives I could be looking at. This is starting to remind me of that dam Elysian Tunic hehe. Any alternative suggestions would be great, I've looked at Ala's and so on and found very little that seems worthwhile. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind I am wearing Ornate and am looking at things 120hp mana and above preferably closer to 200hp mana. I have looked at Veli's tunic in WoS, the DoN Merchant Tunic and Fenin (PoF) Tunic but they all fall short of the Time one, What else if anything is out there that is near or around Time?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be great.</div></div><hr />

DoN Crafted.<br />
<br />
<br />
most crafted armors are too expensive IMHO to be practical, i.e Feran Tunic (and of Ice), trilounhide, windskin. If I had the dough, I'd go with feran tunic for bang/buck.<br />
 <br />
 Grand Tunic of the Oracle and the Cloak of the Azure Sky are long quests.<br />
 <br />
 Vex Thal is old-school and I haven't seen many people interested in VP.<br />
 <br />
Riftseekers might be out of reach.<br />
 <br />
 So what are we left with???<br />
Easiest upgrade is the DoN chest (tanned dragonhide). Potential drops - the bazu hide tunic from WoS (Velitorkin), Dranik's Hollows, PoF. I was going to try to camp the Riwwi tunic but I haven't had the time yet (seems soloable or duoable). not familiar with vxed but sounds doable also.<br />
<br />
you might be able to get the ornate chest but it's not a very big upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for you, i don't see many possible upgrades.<br />
<br />
after  wanderers and kerasha's (awesome chest and will last), I'm seeing drops in the following zones (best to 'worst' lol):<br />
<br />
Everspring Jerkin of the Tangled Briars -         The Bloodfields <br />
Supple White Tunic        -         The Ascent <br />
Yelnia's Tunic        -         Riftseekers' Sanctum <br />
Dark Tunic of the Enslavers        -         Tacvi, Seat of the Slaver <br />
Gaelin's Tunic of Woodlands        -         Abysmal SeaCrafted<br />
Chaos-Imbued Leather Tunic    - higher tier chest drops. (2.0 Encounters). EF LDoN raid<br />
Crescent-Emblazoned Jerkin        Uqua - the Ocean God Chantry <br />
Kerasha's Sylvan Tunic        -         Plane of TranquilityCrafted <br />
<br />
<br />
so as you see, there is a big gap once you get to kerasha's...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not right, the chaos-imbued stuff is higher tier chest drops. (2.0 Encounters)<br />
<br />
I actually had this same problem. The time leather tunic is ultra rare, my guild has cleared it many times and we've only had two of them drop. (i was the first :smile: ). <br />
<br />
Kerasha BP is really nice for this stage and my advice would be to just hold out and save your DKP and wait for it to drop. The Uqua BP is also very nice but its not every day you go knocking at Barxt Quarat's door asking for his leather BPs, might be a safe bet to stick with the time bp.</div></div><hr />

I will check out some of those but most I have seen on Ala's etc. Most likely I will hoard my points for the Time Tunic and hope it actually drops :) There doesn't look to be any real alternatives until you go past time, everything from before or a similar level seems to pale when compared. Leather seems rare for some reason, I have seen nights where 2 of the other classes have dropped but only ever one Leather Tunic. Thems the breaks, thanks for the help guys.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">08-19-2005, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Chaos Imbued Armor can come from almost any of the Epic 2.0 encounters that have a chest.  It is just that the tunic is rarer, do not think it it restricted to just 1 or 2 encounters.<br />
 <br />
An alternative to the time tunic really depends heavily on where you raid when not raiding time and the progression you are making in GoD, OoW, and DoN.<br />
 <br />
If you are able to take on the dragons in DoN, Kess has the nice Supple White Tunic which is on par statwise with Yelnia's tunic from Queen in RS.  Which is possibly still a little above what your guild farms/kills.  The Gaelin armor mold from BP if I am not mistaken drops in Tacvi and Txevu encounters only in GoD so if your guild does not raid them or at that level, then you will not likely see that for a while either.  It doesn't sound like the Everspring Jerkin is a possibility for you as it is the Anguish BP and only drops off OMM and AM in Anguish.  If your guild is in Uqua, then the tunic from Barxt is a possibility.  It really depends on what mobs you take down.  If not would suggest just hold out for a Time BP as I think that took most druids to the top 3/4 tunics currently available, Anguish/Queen in RS/Kess/Muramite armor.</div></div><hr />

I believe with full augs it is 160 hp / mana... so it is still not quite as good as Time tunic (which is what he's looking for)... but it's a very good bp anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soloun</div><div class="date">08-19-2005, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep Time or equiv stats/foci are what I am after. I basically want to obtain a tunic that I will be able to use for a long time to come and based on what we currently raid, Time tunic is my first choice. We don't hit many of the targets some have mentioned outside time, so most are out for the moment. It's good to hear about them though as it will give me something to look out for as we advance. I looked at the Trade Skill versions but they seem to be on par with the DoN Merchant Tunic once auged, plus a guildy has auged her DoN Merchant tunic to almost 200mana, so to me that puts it above the Trade Skill Tunic even though it's still a nice tunic. <br />
<br />
I guess the answer to it all is that yes there are other tunics but they all fall short compared to the Time one, so hang out for the time drop. As a lot of you said :), thanks for the input guys, lots of new ideas to check out.</div></div><hr />

It's something like 680 crystals tho.<br />
<br />
Anyway, tunics are rare as hell. I've seen two leather BPs drop in Time in about 15 full clears. In that time we once got 3 plates, 2 silk. Chain isn't really a problem as Ikkinz 4 raid is easy source of very good chain BPs.<br />
<br />
Got 4 orbs in 15 clears.. I think last one went to an alt.<br />
<br />
Alternative is Uqua.. seen 1 leather BP in I think 5 clears. Planning for this is _not_ a good idea.<br />
<br />
If you can take out Queen Pyrilonis in Riftseekers, that's a really good BP that will last you forever. It's not too tough fight actually.. just annoying.<br />

I'm still wearing Time BP.. then again, we haven't farmed a whole lot of stuff that drops alternatives and it's far from being my worst slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My old guild cleared Uqua 10-ish times I think and I never saw the BP drop. In over a year of being in Time (although they do not actively raid there now) they got 10 orbs and 11 tunics, so figure one per month of each.</div></div><hr />

Except that no matter what aug you put on the tradeskill tunic, that aug would look better on a real piece of equipment.</div></div><hr />

I think we are close to our 2nd month in there so one is due soon assuming the one per month is a good average, yea I know its just luck but a guy can hope.<br />
<br />
Is it just me but I seem to recall that getting a good druid tunic has always been a pita? I keep having these flashbacks to UP and the month and a half of fun in there that it took to get my Tunic drop, at the end of it all it felt good but by then it NEEDED to hehe. <br />
<br />
The tradeskill Tunic is a decent alternative but imagine what the Time one would be like with a decent Aug. With that in mind and keeping a positive outlook, what do you all think is the best way to go with regards to Aug's? Use whatever until you can get...? Go with some sort of Foci? Max out HP Mana? I'd be curious what people think if they care to share...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course. =) But, for those who do not raid at a place where they would have access to a better-than-ornate Tunic, it can be a nice alternative. I'm holding out for Time or Fennin Ro atm because of where my guild is at for now.<br />
<br />
As far as augmentation is concerned, I try to stay away from augmenting focus effects. Instead I tend to look for items with the effects I need and use hp augments or specific resists I am short on. At least, that is how I built my Necromancer and I was told that was a good rule to follow for casters/priests in general. However, I think there is already a pretty good augment discussion going on in another thread here.</div></div><hr />

I would say plate and silk so far being the most seen for chest tho.  It all seems random, I would hang and wait a few before blowing pp on a tunic and auging it, then having to destroy it (cause you know soon as its equipped it will drop).  Hold some dkp and snag it when it does drop, you will be happy wearing it for quite some time.<br />

All of the augments are relatively simply to get. Here are the totals at level 70:<br />
<br />
Grandmaster's Runeseeker Cuirass (Augmented)<br />
MAGIC ITEM  ATTUNEABLE  <br />
Slot: CHEST  <br />
AC: 50<br />
STR: +13  DEX: +16  STA: +18  CHA: +11  <br />
WIS: +18  INT: +13  AGI: +16  HP: +240  <br />
MANA: +240  ENDUR: +210  SV FIRE: +11  SV DISEASE: +11  <br />
SV COLD: +11  SV MAGIC: +7  SV POISON: +11<br />
Mana regeneration: +2<br />
Damage shield: +2<br />
Recommended level of 70.<br />
Required level of 65.<br />
WT:  2.5    Size: LARGE<br />
Class: DRU<br />
Race: HEF<br />
Slot 1, type 7: Blighted Stone of the Heathen (Unrest instance)<br />
Slot 2, type 11: Grandmaster's Chest Symbol of Growth (Crafted, Tunare)<br />
Slot 3, type 12: Gem of Bolstered Power (Tipt)<br />
<br />
While this is obviously not as good as the ones that have been listed due to lack of focus effect, it's something to consider. <br />
<br />
Take out Gem of bolstered power, put in the 680 crystal aug from DoN, and my 70 druid wears the basic thing only for halfling Karana. As juniper said, yeah it dont got the foci's, but you pick them up from other items or can just buy the ice foci from DoN. Heck im in Inktut`ta now and still perfer my tunic right now. You can save your DKP for time tunic Soloun, or heavily consider this and spend your DKP on other items on your wish list, cause in comparison for what your guild is capible, its just as good bud.<br />
<br />
And to comment on what you said Alueaia, there is one aug that not only looks better on a tunic like this, but only fits this. And thats the new quested type12 aug from DoD.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
My guild does Time about 20 Times rigth now, we got 12 Orbdrops right now and 2 Leather pattern so far. The last two orbs were rotting because all druids have one.<br />
 <br />
Other example in 20 raids we only get 1 spear of Faith, other guild same server got 6 SoF in the same time.<br />
 <br />
It's all about luck it seems.<br />
 <br />
P.S. for BP i stay with my AHR BP until i can lay my hand on a RSS Queen drop or something similar, or the time BP if i could get it for minimum DKP ;)</div></div><hr />
