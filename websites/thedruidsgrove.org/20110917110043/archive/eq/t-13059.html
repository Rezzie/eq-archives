Doing 69.1 hard solo is awesome xp.. 6 kills for 1aa  i am at the moment using root and rot.. once the initial camp is cleared there is ample room to dot and kite (inside zone cant quad) just wondering if there is any significant advantage to either method.</div></div><hr />

Only that sometimes roots don't hold very well so you'll waste mana to re-root. In such a case you just kite.<br />
 <br />
Like to learn more about the mission. Specifically, can you get the mission by yourself, or you need to group with two other people just to get it? What are the levels and hitpoints of the mobs? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As far as I know for us the damage done should be the same to a rooted mob or a mob snared running after us.  I know that Rangers arrows do less damage to a rooted mob vs a snared mob, but shouldn't effect our damage.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
and at times i have had up to 5 on the go at one time, snared/rooted (there is a few wanderers i found that can be a pain).<br />
 <br />
my spell line up is:<br />
 <br />
Ancient: Clorobon<br />
Immolation of The Sun<br />
Vengeance of the Sun<br />
Wasp Swarm<br />
Vengeance of Tunare<br />
Swarming Death (i have the clikey, but prefer using the spell due to cast time)<br />
Earthen Roots<br />
Ensnare<br />
Serpent Vines<br />
 <br />
I load 2 snares because ensnare overwrites serpent vines, so after i have got them snared easily with vines, i can overwrite with ensnare just incase i get adds and the short duration snare will run out.<br />
 <br />
Generally with lvl 1 of the DoDH crit dot aas, i can kill a single mob easily in under 3 minutes id say.<br />
 <br />
I found they have simililar HP to drakes in instanced nest zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many years ago, there used to be.<br />
<br />
It hasn't been that way in some time however.<br />
<br />
Just like ages ago a mob could not be snared and rooted at the same time.<br />
