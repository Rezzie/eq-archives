I think i must be doing something wrong, I find myself unable to solo for any XP, I have tryed to solo via DoT, Quad, Root-rot and even nukeing. I am willing to take any advice i can get here. (Oh and on the things i can kill it takes almost all of the mana i have or it takes far to long to make it worth my time/effert is this how its supposed to be?) I hope this is the right section to post this kind of question. thank you in advance</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The 2 things i can suggest are 1) go against weaker content and 2) be more conscious of mana usage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baou</div><div class="date">07-13-2007, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far the zones i have tryed to solo are, HoH, WoS, NC, BF, RCOD, and a few others of simalr lvls. But i upgraded some of my focus gear yestersay when the servers came back up so i should be doin a little better ( Magelo still wont work from the update</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TwistedBlue</div><div class="date">07-13-2007, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not so much your doing anything wrong, it is just at that lvl regular XP is just very very slow solo. (at any lvl really) If you want to see the Regular XP bar move grouping is where it is at. But finding a group in mid 60's is no easy task either.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember spending alot of time kiteing and Root/roting NC murks at 66 untill I found a group. <br />
<br />
Like Aldier said, Go for weaker content. Find something you can kill efficiently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baou</div><div class="date">07-13-2007, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice. will try some lower content and see if i have more luck with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">07-23-2007, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's most likely your focus effects and gear... or lack thereof.<br />
 <br />
I remember getting to the point at level 65 where I could quad non-stop in PoFire without ever running out of mana between dotting mobs with orb of swarming death and rain spells.  It became extremely easy.  A druid friend of mine asked me to grab some AAs on his toon so I figured why not.  He had pretty crummy gear and I actually had to sit and med halfway though killing a quad.  Needless to say, I didn't get him many AAs.<br />
 <br />
Hate to say it but those raid gear focus effects really make a huge difference when you add them all up.  FT5 isn't going to help you much.<br />
 <br />
So the honest advice is gear, gear, gear.</div></div><hr />

Stonemites and um... I don't remember what else. Whenever you get those zone out and get a fresh instance.</div></div><hr />

Stick to Pooka's and the dogs, they dont summon. Neither do the lizard things, but they are few and far between. Can ya tell it's been a while since I have been there? :lol:</div></div><hr />
