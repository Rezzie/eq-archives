Title is a little miss representitve.  BUT &quot;Thinking about returning to WOW And want to play a Druid, and haven't played a Druid since EQ days, and need some help!&quot;  is way way too long to type as a topic title.<br />
<br />
Ok, I have played a druid in WOW, just long enough to know there's not much corrilation between WOW and EQ Druids (my favorite of all classes).  <br />
<br />
I've been away from the game for a few months, and am considering a return.  None of my in game friends are still around so it will be a semi fresh start and I've got to assume a lot of solo time.  <br />
<br />
Any reliable class guides for a soloable, but reasonably group friendly druid?  I want to just be able to kick back and play casually.  Don't care about raids (schedule won't permit it, EQ Raiding left a bad taste), end game (same as my feeling about raids).  I don't do PVP any more than necessary. (too many years in real life PVP, and not interested.  Plus I suck at it to boot.).<br />
<br />
Server suggestions?  My highest charecter (80 hunter) is currently on The Scryers, but as I said, none of my friends are there, and starting on a new server (low pop) wouldn't kill me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">09-15-2009, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for servers, I reccomend just finding a guild that seems like a good feel for you and just going with them on their server.  <br />
<br />
I have tried several different leveling guides, and found that nothing seems quite as good as simply downloading &quot;QuestHelper&quot; &amp; &quot;TomTom&quot; mods.  It kinda sucks the RPG portion of WoW out, but its definatley the most efficient way to get to 80.  You'll find your self just stock piling quests and then making a sweep through each zone.  ( I was turning in between 5-10 quests at a time.)  <br />
<br />
The big hang up for me with the guides is you have to follow them without faulter or you end up waisting a lot of time.  I found my self spending more time scowering over the guide than playing.  So I prefer the mods.  They tell you where to go, and easily dot up your mini map so you can plan your own travel plans (if you don't like the route TomTom picks for you).<br />
<br />
I strongly reccomend you spend / farm some badges from your hunter and purrchase some heirlooms (Shoulders and Chest first).  If you can, grab the weapon too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Likewise about the heirloom gear, it does make an appreciable difference, especially at very low levels where the gear you get is pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
Servers I can't really advise on, I've been on the same one since day one.  You don't say whether you're on US or EU but if the latter and you're looking for a casual guild to hang out in we can probably find you a home if you're looking for a mid population PvE server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Similar situation for me.  I moved servers about a month after starting vanilla Wow, to play with a RL friend.  Other then that I have always been close with my guildies, so transfering servers was never really an option I considered. <br />
<br />
I know one thing that I do regret about the server I chose was the timezone its in.  Make sure to find a guild that raids on a schedule you can work with (if raiding is a focus for you)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Badges from via PVP?  Probably won't happen for me.  I bite at PVP and can't handle the BG grind.  But my main has enough cash to help buy some stuff.<br />
<br />
Anyone on TDG from The Scryers?<br />
<br />
Love quest helper.  I resisted using it for a long time, but first time i broke down and grabbed it, I decided within minutes I couldn't hardly live without it.</div></div><hr />

I fail at and despise pvp right now (but have a bunch of guildies that are trying to force me to alter my views lol).<br />
<br />
As for QH- zomg yes!  Cartographer helps with that also (as I had some compatibility or user-ability issues with Tomtom).  <br />
<br />
And, in all honesty, the best druid-class guide I've ever found, EVER, has been this forum.  There's a lot of first-hand knowledge here from trial and error.  If only the DK forums were as gentle in their guidance &gt;.&gt;<br />

I think he was talking about the Emblems of Heroism, where you get the bonus exp and they're basically blues. They're stats will change with your level so you *never* have to grind any particular instance for that certain  piece of gear (unless you just like the way it looks).</div></div><hr />
