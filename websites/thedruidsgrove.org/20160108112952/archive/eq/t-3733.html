I've never understood why people keep xp'ing when the next AAs dont add anything useful.   I've pretty much stopped xp'ing unless I need to farm tradeskill components.   I could still max out resists and stats, but they arent going to help much at all as shown by this post.<br />
<br />
I guess stat AAs are mostly there for those who want to get 305 in each stat for their magelo as they dont really do much for a priest other than wisdom.   I even regret spending points on wisdom AA, though, as I bought the points way before getting into the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know Agility is mostly about the AC, but between the two I think Dex is more valuable (well particularly if you are a tradeskiller).  <br />
<br />
Dex is supposed to govern skill ups for some tradeskills (though I have heard mixed things on that) and also I THINK it is the one that affects your ability to channel through and regain concentration.<br />
<br />
Sad for me cuz my AGI is much better than my DEX.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My plan is to eventually do AAs until I have bought everything I can and then bank a few so that when new AAs come out, I'm ready for them. It's just the completist aspect in me asserting itself. However, it'll be a long time before this casual, slow-paced druid is done buying useful skills, so that's a seriously long term plan for me, especially since I didn't exp in PoP to my fullest advantage (reasons: duoing with wife's primary alt in non-prime exp zones, playing my own alts, taking time off from the game, etc.) and the solo exp nerf is impending. :) <br />

<br />
Dexterity will help with proc rates.  I haven't seen any studies that showed that it helps with channeling.<br />
<br />
Agility adds avoidance AC as opposed to mitigation AC.  High agility will help with not getting hit.  Since we mitigate hits about as well as tissue paper, avoidance AC is very nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped caring about xp like 2-3 months ago (around aa 250 I think), but 90% of what I do, whether it be raiding, helping friends out, killing stuff for tradeskills, gets me xp in some manner.<br />
<br />
And sorry, I just don't die that often... I mean, I do sometimes on raids but thats about the only time... if my friends need a healer in earth (yes druids can be main healer in earth) and I help out for 2-3 hrs, it's hard not to walk away with at least 2-3aa just from that, and usually with some tradeskill crap as well.<br />

<br />
It's hard to avoid AAs now.   I got everything I wanted months ago, so I stopped pushing for the XP, otherwise I'd be maxxed out a while back.  I get AA XP pretty much as a matter of just playing the game.<br />
<br />
I farm giants for loot and tradeskill materials.  The nice AA XP is pure lagniappe.<br />
<br />
I PL'ed a guild CoH mage-bot recently.  I picked up about 10 or so AA as a side effect.<br />
<br />
I've been killing lots of DB mobs for quest items.  Lots of side AA from that, too.<br />
<br />
Grouped with a guild mini-raid killing PoP mobs for flagging.  Picked up an AA doing that.<br />
<br />
<br />
It really isn't a question of why do I continue to get AA XP.  It's a question of HOW do you continue to play this game and NOT get AA XP???</div></div><hr />

Before I quit EQ and before I dinged 63 for CoT I don't know how many time's I'd be quietly root dotting frogs in PoS only to look up and see all the frogs gone and Scirocco afk on the hill waiting for respawns. :)  <br />
