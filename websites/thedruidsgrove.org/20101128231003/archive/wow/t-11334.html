 All this time workin out my spec. Going over it again and again. Then finally printing it out and putting it into action. I go into the BG's and Im doing well with my 1/41/9 build. However after a short time I keep thinking something is missing, then I realise. I DID NOT PUT A POINT INTO FERAL FAERIE FIRE, and it was on my printout.<br />
<br />
 I was so mad I wanted to punch myself in the face....lol. 45 gold to respec   :P.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and the DPS you will gain from Mangle is twice of which you would gain from OOC. You need to have Mangle if your feral.</div></div><hr />

Cool, was quite disapointed with it tbh, but if youre right -yey! (only critted 7-800) I havent tried mangle with rip fully yet tho.<br />

This is my build (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent-bc=MzZxhGscrRxuioV0o).. wanted to test the new hi feral abilitys... had 1 point left.. spent it on natural shapeshifter :P<br />
<br />

Think of mangle as the replacement for claw. In those terms, there's no possible way you can think it sucks since it does almost twice as much damage. And until BC comes out and we get the 30% bonus to shred when mangle debuff is on our target, it is the replacement for shred too. So remove shred and claw from your toolbars right now. And don't put shred back on until BC.</div></div><hr />

I once specced oomkin in a drunk revelry and noticed (when I sobered up) that I didn't have any gear for it (panzerkin sucks tbh)..<br />
<br />
I also noticed I didn't have money to specc back to my lovely feral.. but it went ok anyway, I logged on to IRC and expressed my dilemma and got sponsored by a undead lock woman (who apparently lives not far from me IRL) and got my 50g to respecc back..<br />
<br />
Gotta luv them undead women sometimes. :D</div></div><hr />
