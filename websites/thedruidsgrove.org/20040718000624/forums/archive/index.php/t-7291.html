<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megadwen</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since my guild is dkp, it's really unwise to go for both Orb of Clinging Death (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26895) and Symbol of the Planesmasters (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20898). so i want to see what my much wiser druid peers think...<br />
<br />
should i get orb of clinging death for the clicky swarming<br />
<br />
or symbol of planesmasters for the 30% dot damage focus, stun resist (and i do melee some so a proc would be kinda neat)<br />
<br />
thanks for any input  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldnt bother with bidding on symbol till I finished my collection of usually more expensive Quarm loots = p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megadwen</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">have to spend dkp on anything you loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iisbliss</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">spending and bidding are different<br />
<br />
each item in our system has a &quot;base&quot; or minimum price, but you are allowed to &quot;bid&quot; your DKP (only we dont call it that, since our system is older than DKP).<br />
<br />
this means the more hot an item is or the more classes that can use it the more expensive it will be, because more people will &quot;bid&quot; the price up from &quot;base&quot;<br />
<br />
we dont bid against each other for druid only loots, we just go with straight random and buy for base, so we can save our DWP for bidding against those pesky clerics and shamans and wizzies that are so annoying.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have both.  I use both.  Interestingly, I don't normally use the Symbol of the Planesmasters for the dot enhancement.  But the right clickable proc thats on it.  This proc was a signifigant gain to my aggro abilities and I often used it in places like ST / VP / ToV / Kael when helping minor guilds by being SA / TA for mobs.  My HP / AC was typically in line with their best tanks, I just needed to generate enough aggro to keep the mobs off their casters.<br />
<br />
I haven't done any of these encounters since buying SCS3 though, and suspect I no longer have enough aggro without an anger 3 augment in my hammer of hours.</div></div><hr />

Your guild's site kicks ass.  Its a great reference on mobs and items.  It has been a great help to me when I price my guild's DKP each time we advance to a new level.  I have not found a site that more efficiently organizes raid loot and mobs.  Send my thanks to whomever does your site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildan</div><div class="date">06-18-2004, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have either at this point but if I could choose a range item I'd say Anuek Contemplation Skull (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27323) is better than both. At least it is for me having only spell haste IV</div></div><hr />
