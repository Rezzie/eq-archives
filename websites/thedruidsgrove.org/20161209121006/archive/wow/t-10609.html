<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">05-19-2006, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been a 14/32/5 druid for a long time because I really enjoy being able to pvp, dps/stealth, tank/offtank. Recently I have been considering a possible move to 0/30/21.  I fear though that after changing I would miss the skills you get out of the 14/32/5 spec.  What compels me to focus on better healing is the fact I am hitting ZG/MC/Onyxia these days and healing is always in demand.<br />
<br />
Need some thoughts on just how shocking this move might feel.  <br />
<br />
-Not having LotP.<br />
-Not having natures grasp<br />
-Not having OoC (I most commonly use this in dungeons.  When it procs, I pop up and contribute to healing at no cost to my mana.)<br />
<br />
 I want to be an effective pvp'er, while still able to tank/offtank &amp; heal efficiently.  Having Heart of the Wild is nice, but I really find my self struggling with mana when healing is my role. Note: I do have int/spitit +healing gear for those healing occasions.  It's generally during the heavy boss fights where my mana is in danger.<br />
<br />
[EDIT] - lastly, I have noticed on more than a couple occasions in the battlegrounds going up against other druids, the following....<br />
<br />
I look to be getting the better of them with my dps, but then suddenly they use their NS and the odds of a victory drop considerably.  I often end up switching my tactics to a getaway plan.  I don't like that much.  Is the 0/30/21 build a better pvp option also??  Is the 0/30/21 druid a &quot;PVP/Survivor/Feral Druid&quot;?<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />

Missing natural weapons and OOC is a blow to pvp, but honestly, imo, NS is one of the best talents in the game.  healing yourself to full from 10HP with a lucky crit while some sucker of a hunter is drawing back for the last shot is a wonderful feeling =).  It also does great things for your ability to keep 5 people up in raid content if you use it to anticipate.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, the first 20 points in resto isn't going to do much for your healing efficiency or staying power.  At best you can forgo imp rejuv/subtlety for 10% mana savings on only HT.  0/30/21 is still a gear dependant build for healing.  If you want to improve staying power as a healer without increasing gear you need to go 24/0/27 or 0/11/40.</div></div><hr />

Atleast until I get my superior pvp set.  With innervate, I think I will be just fine.  I have some good healing gear, so I will just work on making my mana more efficient.  One of the biggest problems I run into is double healing.  A priest could be healing at the same time i am so my mana is wasted.  I know Cosmos has an addon that shows casting, but that displays on the WoW party UI, not on the CTRaid UI.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions!</div></div><hr />

It's nice for knowing how long your (or another's) HoT has remaining on a target.  It's also quite nice for PvP, as you can see the cast time of the spell your opponent is trying to get off.</div></div><hr />

When running in WSG you'd go out of mana quicker than you could blink and boy oh boy is that bad for us.</div></div><hr />
