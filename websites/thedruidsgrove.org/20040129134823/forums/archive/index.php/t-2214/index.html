<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DaliX SoulFly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">how long has this NPC been showing up in Burningwoods?<br />
<br />
while omw to Chardok, i saw her on track, she was standing right next to Telin.<br />
<br />
she is the same NPC from Greater Fay from our Epic, but i don't recall ever seeing her in Burningwoods.<br />
<br />
i hailed her and she said something about, &quot;did you think i was gone for good&quot; and something about &quot;the trial of our strength&quot;<br />
<br />
at any rate, this seems new to me. i don't ever recall seeing her on track while running to Chardok.<br />
<br />
i tried saying alot of things to her, but she didn't respond to any of them, though i'll try again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
if anyone has any info on her or gets her to talk please post it here.<br />
<br />
could it be Epic 2.0? i doubt it, but i'm curious to she what she's up to.<br />
<br />
thanks, Dali</div></div><hr />
