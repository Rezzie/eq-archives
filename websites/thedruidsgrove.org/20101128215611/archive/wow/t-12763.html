Weapon damage makes NO difference on the damage we do with our paws.</div></div><hr />

The only thing weapon skill effects is when you actually hit something with a weapon.  <br />
 <br />
Which can be helpful if you are healing and need to knock down a totem or something really quick.</div></div><hr />

We don't benefit from the +weapon damage component in our forms, though.  That doesn't bother me personally and I always use stones during raids and also pvp - they are nice because they persist through death.  :&gt;<br />

That's another slot I'll need in inventory now for weightstones. Maybe I don't &quot;need&quot; 6 different type of food however... :ohwell:</div></div><hr />
