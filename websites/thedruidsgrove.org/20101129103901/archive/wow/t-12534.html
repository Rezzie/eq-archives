<br />
If Season 3 Arena Gear (for example) is much better than some of the gear you are currently healing in...would it not be a good idea to purchase it and use it for raid healing?  <br />
<br />
Especially if that one one piece you've been farming forever just WILL NOT drop. :mad2:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP gear isn't too bad for PvE healing, though I wouldn't want to be wearing a full suit of PvP gear on a raid (too many of the item's &quot;item points&quot; are spent on +res, +sta and +armor).  But one or two pieces won't hurt especially if the stats it does provide are better than your existing piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poysonivy</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have 3 pieces of PvP/Arena gear. And it's pretty good to fill in those slots where you don't get that many drops. I have wrist, belt and head atm. Also love the extra stamina boost. Keeps me up much longer then some of my colleague healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.  I've been sort of hording my arena points.  TBH, I hate to part with them knowing there's always something better just around the corner....:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
But at this point, I can afford (3) pieces of the Season 2 set or (2) pieces of the Season 3 set (with the third piece soon to follow).<br />
<br />
So question is....should I wait for Season 4 to come out?  I suspect at that point Season 3 will be reduced cost-wise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes season 3 gear would come at lower costs as soon as season 4 comes out, but just wait for season 4 and buy those pieces instead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya....I've considered that.  It's just that I'm greedy and I want to be able to buy a full set all at once. :devil-lau</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-17-2008, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No point in buying 'old' sets, unless you are brand new and getting S1 from honor.  Or if you are point capped and gear capped, and are picking old stuff up just cause you like the way it looks.  <br />
<br />
The resiliance from S1 - S3 has stayed the same, but all the stats go up moderatley per season, so its a good upgrade.  I haven't heard of a release date for S4 yet, but a lot of ppl I know / play with are working towards maxing arena and honor points (5k and 75k respectivley).</div></div><hr />
