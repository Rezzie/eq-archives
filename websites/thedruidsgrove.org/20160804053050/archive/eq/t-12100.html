The pet double hits for a high of 350 damage. He seems to hang around for about 20-30 seconds. His graphic is the standard BOOBOO the bear graphic, but it says &quot;&lt;your name=&quot;&quot;&gt;'s Pet&quot;. <br />
<br />
Has anyone maxed out the AA? Does he hit harder? How long does he hang around for?&lt;/your&gt;</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see it shortened to be more in line with the Swarm Pets type AA that other classes get.  More like 15 minutes vice the 22 minutes that NG is now.  The reuse time compared to the damage output that little BooBoo does compared to the amount of AAs this cost to max is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

The last time I popped the level 1 pet it hit 7 times, missed 8 times, and did 1820 damage while he was up. Higher levels will obviously produce more damage. The next time I'll try and cast Lion on him to see if that damage can be upped a littel bit. Even so, 2k of damage mana-free is well worth 3AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i tried that and swarm pets arent tagged as your actual pet aparently.  When you try to cast it, the spell tells you that you have to cast it on your pet.<br />
<br />
Would have been nice, since thats the only form of haste we get.  I think if they keep the 22 minute timer they should have booboo 2.0 spawn with atleast some form of haste.  up its dps a little bit that way and i wouldnt mind the 22 minute timer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">10-02-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most swarm pets die very fast, especially in raid situations with things like enrage, AEs, AE rampage, etc..  it's not obscene amounts of damage, and it will rarely (if ever) be the make-or-break ability in a fight.  He's on a 22 minute timer probably because that's about the reuse on most melee offensive discs and other caster swarm pets (I could be wrong here, haven't looked up all the AAs and such for casters and melee thing is only from playing a rogue for a short amount of time).  I think he's a cute and fun addition to the arsenal and honestly. If you don't appreciate the laugh you can get out of watching 4-6 druid pets trying their hardest to do tidbits of damage (it's really funny seeing the druid pet swarm!), the AA prolly isn't worth it for it's cost =/</div></div><hr />

You get the first 30 seconds for 3 aa, then have to pay 6aa for the next 15 seconds and presumably 9aa for the final 15 seconds?  Why does SoE still design AA that give dimishing returns for MORE cost?  Thought the GoD AA would have taught them that that wasn't the best of designs....(yeah, there were some AAs before GoD that were like that, but, GoD was the one so bad that many things about it had people quit'ing en masse.)</div></div><hr />
