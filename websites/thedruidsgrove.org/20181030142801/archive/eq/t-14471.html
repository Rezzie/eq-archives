So any recommendations on good spots to solo in the TSS zones?<br />
 <br />
Inquiring minds would like to know ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gray Legion dude to the right of zone in - Direwind<br />
Griffons at Druid Rings in Direwind - Or altenatively the gnolls just around the corner<br />
Bears in Direwind, around the corner from the &quot;Direwind Current&quot; marked on map<br />
<br />
Mammoths/Kobolds near the Wiz spires in Icefall - Note that Mammoths have around 100k hp, but are white/yellow to 75 so yield more exp.<br />
<br />
They're the only places i've tried so far - Exp ranged from 10% - 18% per kill with a 90aa/10normal exp split.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
i can usually DPS them down before serpent vines wears off (under 3 mins) and they take about half my mana bar per kill (10.5kish)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another soloable zone is Valdeholm.  You can kite the blobs and spiders by frostcrypt ent - however, be careful pulling anything past FC ent, because most of that summons.  The tigers on the hill summon as well.  Mammoths in the zone are soloable as well, but I've never kited them without the giants (who are not soloable) in front of them cleared out. The mammoths here run extremely slow.  All mobs in Vald have a LOT of hp and a small XP hit, but a chance at high level spells.</div></div><hr />

It is kinda hidden. I headed east through the crevass by the bears and ran across to a goblin camp. I was aggroed by 1 see invis. There was a wizzy killing the spider and icepiles. How fast do these spiders and icepiles pop? I never had a chance to kill anything as it looks like a 1 person camp.</div></div><hr />
