<br />
I've been using TDG for a few month now (ty for all the info btw) but this is my first post.<br />
What i'm looking for is a macro to apply my HoT's then shift to bear and finish with FFF to pull.<br />
<br />
Can this be done with 1 macro or would I need 1 for the HoT's and 1 to shift and pull?<br />
<br />
Any help with this would be gratefully recieved as we start Kara tonight with me as Tank.<br />

<br />
Umm...do you want a full stack of Lifebloom as a part of the HoT'ing up? Cause that would make it take a lot more time.<br />
<br />
If you don't need a full stack, try this.<br />
<br />
<br />
/cast Regrowth (Rank 10)<br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast Rejuvination (Rank 13)<br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast Lifebloom (Rank 1)<br />
<br />
And for the Shift/Pull<br />
<br />
/cast Bearform<br />
/cast Fairie Fire (Feral)<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to have the mob targetted though for it to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That might not be precisely right (I recommend using the skills from the skillbook and not this) but it should suffice. Every time you hit the macro button you'll cast another thing in this sequence. I would imagine that the lifebloom would hurt a bit here, but it's probably okay. You could also throw in an enrage at the end.</div></div><hr />
