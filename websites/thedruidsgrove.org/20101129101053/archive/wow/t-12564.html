<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found myself in ZA recently with a holy paladin, resto shaman and myself (resto druid).  Anyway, it didn't go so well.  I felt like was carrying the bulk of the healing load.  Perhaps it was the healing assignments.  I always try to keep the tanks HoT'd and put any extra cycles on the raid healing.  This time it was supposed to be Holy Paladin on MT, me HoTing tanks with backup raid healing, and shaman strictly on raid healing (with any extra cycles on tank if needed).  <br />
<br />
If you were in ZA how would you assign the healers?  We did ok on the bear boss but the Eagle boss (and raid healing) was where it fell apart.  I had shammy on raid heals but I ended up having to short-change the HoTs on the MT and heal the raid primarily.  In the end we had a Prot. Pally mainly healing the tank and all three of us healers were on raid dmg primarily.   (Sadly the Prot. Pally outheals the holy pally... so one wonders what is going on).<br />
<br />
I totally felt like there was 1.5 healers on the raid, not 3.  Not sure exactly what the problem is, I know everyone is trying hard.  They have decent gear, they have decent specs.  Maybe it is the healing assignments?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resto shamans are arguably the best multi target healers in the game (aside from CoH priests, I suppose).  Ideal for raid healing.<br />
<br />
Resto druids do anything very well.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like the healing assignments were perfect, and the problem was that the raid was taking too much damage. <br />
<br />
Really on that fight your raid shouldn't be taking too much damage at all if everyone has DBM and can get into the 'safe spot' for the electrical storm and they are spread out in a semi-circle around him so that Chain Lightning doesn't hit tons of ppl.  Range dps can try to take down a few of the birds if possible to help keep dmg down on raid, though the birds don't hit too hard at all.  Cyclone is annoying, but healers should have enough time to notice someone is cycloned, then get prepared for them to take 50% dmg (unless they are a rogue, druid, mage or priest)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... we had a TON of raid dmg.  It wasn't due to the storms though, people were for the most part collapsing properly.  I think  it was primarily birds and static disruption causing the most dmg.  We don't kill the birds as the belief is/was that they're immediately replaced.<br />
<br />
I wish I had kept a log for that run.  Next time I'll provide a link to a WWS report and perhaps folks can give me pointers on what to look for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course a prot pally on MT healing will outheal a holy pally on raid heals because the main tank takes a lot more damage than the raid does in most raid encounters (the standard is 75/25 for most encounters, although obviously there are exceptions).<br />
<br />
It makes absolutely no sense that people are dying to eagles (which don't hit hard) or Static Disruption/Gust of Wind (which don't happen often enough that the player can't be healed up before the next one hits).  It sounds like one or more of your healers is seriously slacking.  Find out who.<br />
<br />
All I can give you here is my personal strategy for this fight.  We whack-a-mole healing in ZA, so there aren't any formal assignments.  What I do is keep Lifebloom and Rejuvenation up on the MT for the entire fight and help out with raid heal with Lifebloom on those taking eagle damage and Regrowth on those who have eaten a Static Disruption or a Gust of Wind in between refreshes on the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only fight I ever really had healing assignments for in ZA was Malacrass and the Dragonhawk boss, the rest are just heal 'em when they need it.</div></div><hr />

Also, we don't have the raid spread out a lot on that fight.  We have four spots and 2 people in each spot.  This makes the jog to the storm a little easier, but I wonder if the chaining of static disruption is perhaps more brutal than it should be?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">04-24-2008, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I think so too.  My suspicions are the pally but only for the reason that she's always at the bottom of the &quot;healing done&quot; list on recount, even on 25 man runs, even when we have other pallies with lesser gear topping the list.  Maybe combat log analysis will provide a reason why.<br />
<br />
Well ... there's really only one reason that a pally would ever be at the bottom of the healing meter.  Your pally is clearly being controlled by something with sub-human intelligence, such as, for instance, a household pet, or even a rock.<br />
<br />
I'd bring one of the other pallies in to replace this one ...<br />
<br />
Also, we don't have the raid spread out a lot on that fight.  We have four spots and 2 people in each spot.  This makes the jog to the storm a little easier, but I wonder if the chaining of static disruption is perhaps more brutal than it should be?<br />
<br />
Definitely don't have two people standing on the same spot, this doubles the healing you have to do for each Static Disruption!  Like I said above, everyone can stand in a circle around Akil'zon and be the same distance away from the tank (which is where I presume you are running for the Electrical Storm), and still be spread out enough that Static Disruption only ever hits one person.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind that Static Disruption is an AoE effect and doesn't chain from one player to another.  It affects everyone within a 12 yard radius from the target of the spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That actually sounds like you're complicating the fight.<br />
<br />
If you have all the ranged and healers spread out along the edge of the slightly raised rectangle, and tank him in the middle, you can all collapse onto the tank prior to the storm coming ( boss mods, watching for rain, whatever your method is ).  That way you can all continue to DPS him while he does the storm.  <br />
<br />
This CAN tax healing some b/c sometimes he'll do a static disruption just prior to a storm and everyone will get whacked for 3k or whatever, but with chain heal you guys should be able to recover very quickly.</div></div><hr />

With really excellent healers the 2 people per spot was ok but difficult but with kind of marginal healing... this didn't work out well at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I did that a few months back.  Enjoy all of your free time now :)  A couple of my friends are in closed beta for Warhammer, and they say its insane.  A bunch of us are going to pick it up when it comes out.  You should check it out ^^<br />
<br />
Come Wrath I'll be back...will probably re-roll....again LOL.  Maybe get a Warlock to 80 &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
heh.  I can't tell you how much fun a warlock is, both PvE and PvP.  I cant help but speculate about how ridiculous a lock at 80 will be...  I'm working on gearing up my Warrior atm... thats a fun class too.  <br />
<br />
IMO reroll horde :P</div></div><hr />

Or bad?  My brother is a warhammer beta tester (and has played and continues to play wow since beta), I don't get warm fuzzies from his reports.  Sure, there are a few features that sound neat, but the game is appears to be much slower paced than WoW (by design).  It is obviously still in its early phases.  As too many features are still disabled.  I will take a look at it once it is finalized.<br />
<br />
Though I look forward to WotWK as I have been &quot;behind the wave&quot; so to speak in Wow.  I look forward to being on, or at least, near the front of the pack when it is released.</div></div><hr />

Mainly they are talking about the classes and environment and stuff, as well as speculating on the features that are still to be released.  No way to know for sure what it will be like at release.<br />
<br />
We've all been playing WoW since release, and have multiple 70s and whatnot, and all the content is getting ... old.  I presume they are being overzealous in their reports of how cool WH is mainly cause it something new, and not the same cookie cutter arena comps / dumbass bg pugs / instances / rep grinds / raids weve been pounding away at for too long now.<br />
<br />
I still am having a lot of fun with WoW, and when WotLK comes out, I'll be right there pushing my toons up to 80 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already have my warlock on Bloodhoof reserved ;)<br />
<br />
I've been able to play some of the WAR beta.  It's not bad, but I don't get the warm fuzzies ( to steal the phrase from above ) about it.  It just seems to lack a little something.  The environments are fairly drab and everything is dark earth tones.  Maybe I like the mild cartoon aspect of WoW more than I thought.<br />
<br />
Warriors are ok so long as you don't have to tank.  That takes way too much work :(  DPS warriors are FUN though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
BG9 is where its at... Great pvp.<br />
<br />
My warrior is purely a PvP toon.  Staying with my MS build.  I respec my warlock weekly for PvE (43/0/18 UA with malediction) and PvP (24/37/0 SLSL) ... 100g per week ugh ... so I don't plan on doing that with another toon.  <br />
<br />
I've only seen WAR beta on youtube clips and heard about it from friends, but I haven't played it myself.  I really hope it lives up to the expectations, but from hearing what you and tlbj say, I'm becoming skeptical.</div></div><hr />
