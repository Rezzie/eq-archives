Can someone explain to me what the different &quot;Tiers&quot; of armor/gear represent?  I don't really get it and cant find a simple explanation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">10-10-2006, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tier gear is basically a set that blizzard has put together, that when equipped has bonus stats for wearing like 3,5, and 8 pieces. Tier 0 is gear found in the 5 and 10 man instances such as LBRS, UBRS, DM, Scholo, etc. Tier 1 is gear that is found within the Molten Core. Tier 2 is found off of Onyxia, Rag, and the majority in Blackwing Lair. Tier 2.5 comes from AQ40 and Tier 3 comes from Naxxaramas.<br />
<br />
Everything except for Tier 0 and Tier 0.5 requires 40 man raids to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our main job in a raid is to heal, giving us gear that helps us do what we do most often only really makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">10-10-2006, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I know that the main role for most druids in a raid is healing. However, since my main role in a raid is tanking (we're only at Fankriss in AQ40 yet though -- it may change once my guild reaches Nax and the warriors start getting tier 3), it annoys me a bit. :-)</div></div><hr />

I don't mind it tbh, i can always ninja rogue (non set) stuff for soloing and as I am almost always healing in the 20/40 man's it helps me to be a more effective healer whilst maintaining my ability be an effective off tank/dps'er when necessary. In general though, I would like a &quot;Feral Set&quot; that doesn't require a whole load of gold to get (Feralheart) as I am skint. <br />
<br />
Yeah, we can get the rogue sets, but that requires all the rogues in the raid to have it or better already and the set stats are not really for us when it increases you attack power on evicerate (sp?). Yes, we can PvP and get the sweet, SWEET PvP sets, but jesus, I don't want to quit my job to get to rank 13.</div></div><hr />
