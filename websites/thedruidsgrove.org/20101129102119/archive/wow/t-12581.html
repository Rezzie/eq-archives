<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Misha&amp;n=Magellan<br />
<br />
My +healing needs work (+1538 unbuffed) and I'm working on it (HH Rep - I still can't believe I missed that)...BUT...with only 42 badges to go, the Gavel of Naaru Blessings is within my grasp:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34896<br />
<br />
I have Kara on farm, a weekly ZA run (up to 3rd boss), with an occasional Gruuls.<br />
<br />
The drops I've been farming that never seem to drop can't elude me forever, can they?<br />
<br />
Should I just use my badges for the upgrades that I clearly need (hello &quot;green&quot; trinket?) or should I hold out for that mace?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-30-2008, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the mace.  The other stuff will eventually drop.  :)  I have that mace now too, and got the voodoo shaker to go with it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
how does it stack up against the one you get from Exalted with someone or other....Sha'tar ?<br />
<br />
i mean i'm sure its better but does it warrant the spending of 150 badges or could they be put to better use on other (multiple) item upgrades?<br />
<br />
ofc if you raid a lot i guess badges are 2 a penny and its easy to rack them up for a badge purchase ? if then ignore my ramblings....;) <br />
<br />
as an occasional heroic 5 man only raider ;)  they take some saving up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">05-01-2008, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah..... 150 badges is still painful but for me its only been like 4 weeks worth of effort between dailys and full clears of Kara once a week (worth 19-23 badges... easily worth th 3.5 hours in there.)  I'm doing it for the DPS staff.  We had one priest do it for the healy mace.  That thing is amazing.<br />
<br />
If you are doing Kara regularly and clearing all the way through, you'll quickly have badges you need to get some upgrades.  Another trinket option is to start running Heroic Magister's Terrace.  There is a guaranteed trinket drop with the arena fight there.  So if you can stomach that, someone will be getting an awesome uber trinket every run.<br />
<br />
See I always find it interesting different group's luck... our group equips new healers in like two weeks.  Hell we had one guy go from +900 healing to +2000 healing in two weeks.  He just started and every single healing drop came on every fight for two weeks.  He just cleaned house (our other healer had 90% of the drops).  Then we have rogues who can't buy a damned drop in Kara for 9 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gavel of Pure Light (Sha'tar) &lt; Shard of the Virtuous &lt; Light's Justice &lt; Gavel of Naaru Blessings<br />
<br />
At first I was very wary of the SSO mace and thought I would never take it because of the lack of spirit.  Then 2.4 hit and I realized that my regen was going to be OK even by taking the small hit in spirit you eat when switching from Light's Justice to Gavel of Naaru Blessings.<br />
<br />
I did decide to upgrade my chest and gloves before saving for the mace (which I am still in the midst of doing ATM) ... they were just better upgrades for me from the S1 chest and the cloth gloves from Attumen.  If there is other stuff you need more, then by all means go for them first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">05-01-2008, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it is, I'm averaging about 10 badges a week (I need about 30 or so for &quot;über&quot; mace). <br />
<br />
For pure selfish reasons, (which include bragging rights, may I add ;) ) I'd like to be the first in my Guild to get it.  <br />
<br />
So, with that decision made, I should be proudly weilding my mace within the next few weeks.  :thumbsup: <br />
<br />
Also, as I rather inadvertantly mentioned in another thread, my Guild's MH Druid has been healing with an insane Dreamstate Raid Healing build that he absolutely swears by.  He admits it sucks for 5 man's but, TBH, I never run those anyway.  It's supposed to significantly boost my +healing and mana regen, so what the heck, I'm gonna go for it and test it out this weekend.  I cannot lie, I'm rather leary about it, but regardless of my doubts, I've seen him in action and he's good.<br />
<br />
Feel free to express your doubts.  I will post my new &quot;look&quot; for all of you to see, and let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />

while a fantastic item in terms of mp5, i would advise some caution to see if you can deal with a blow to you mp5. remember a healer with no mana is a useless healer. :) gd luck!<br />

<br />
LOL - Zute, you always make me laugh...but you are probably right.<br />
<br />
I did switch it up last night....for a trial run. Immediately my unbuffed healing shot up +126.  Regardless of that little bonus, it's gonna be hard to adapt to a new way of healing, trial run or not.  I will admit to being a little nervous about my up-coming raids.  But, I'm rather looking forward to running some BG's!  :grin: <br />
<br />
there was a blogpost on the negative aspects of the Gavel of Naaru Blessing<br />
<br />
Tks...gonna read up on that.  Gonna hold out a little longer on some Kara drops (Prince and Dragons tonite).  You never know, I may just get lucky.<br />
<br />
go for it Mag and GL<br />

<br />
Well, it's not so much the build, but the player.  We have seen that Dreamstate healers can compete (although why you'd want to play reactive healer when you don't have to is beyond me).  HT builds are also supposed to own ToL for healing heroics, so I have no idea where your MH is coming from Mag ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of the raids and the 5-man MgT (me being only healer) were sucessful (reg MgT, of course, I'm not suicidal ;)) <br />
<br />
I actually quite enjoy the spec.  Soloing is an absolute riot, but....<br />
<br />
(why you'd want to play reactive healer when you don't have to is beyond me).<br />
<br />
Exactly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zebby</div><div class="date">05-05-2008, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">care to share this new build?<br />
Im gonna ding 70 this weekend and I need to start working on +healing so I can play in kara and heroics. Im not even close to +1000 :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind, however, that although your +healing gets a nice boost, this &quot;hybrid&quot; spec makes healing considerably harder if you aren't used to using Regrowth and HT.  I honestly don't recommend it for starting out in Kara or Heroics (especially Heroics).<br />
<br />
I'm a healer, always have and always will be.  So, I will be switching back to my beloved Tree Form, believe me.  AFTER, that is, I've done a couple week's worth of dailies as a hilarious Moonkin.  :grin:</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Moonkin is a riot for sure. I get alot of &quot;OMG BOOMKIN!!&quot; when I show up to heal a 5man. <br />
I'll be sure to check out your spec also</div></div><hr />

Im on a pvp server. I get ganked alot more as a Moonkin :( A large percent of ganks comes from NE Feral druids too. Damn black cats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's horrible ... I would think you would get ganked less by melee classes as a moonkin!  I find that very few people are willing to go up against me one on one (resto druid), and when they do, it's usually a really bad call on their part (a lot of rogues).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">05-06-2008, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magellan i fell your pain in farming Badges... have the same problems on my mage.<br />
My druid has no probs getting badges. Have about 100 now but dont know on what to spend them really^^ Also with my druid it would be no problem getting badges.<br />
Per weak:  <br />
22 Kara (2,5 hours)<br />
30 ZA -&gt; 15 per run i think? and 3 days timer, so 2 runs a weak (2 hours per run)<br />
30 from raids<br />
5 from dailys (shattered sun bags)<br />
<br />
I wish i could mail them to my mage. Mage only has access to Kara right now. But finally will begin ZA and SSC this weak. Yeepeee<br />
<br />
Im looking forward to the badge items for him. <br />
But still takes long cause there wont be more than 40-50 per weak cause druid is still needed in ZA so i wont be able to do both raids with mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">05-07-2008, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to a couple of questions:<br />
<br />
1. Dreamstate Healing?  In my limited experience with it (a week now), I've gotten comfortable with LB Stacks, Rejeuve, combined with whatever regrowths I need (depending on the Tank I am running with).  Because of it's excrutiating cast time I hate HT, and have created a macro that combines a Nature's Swiftness with a HT cast to provide an immediate large heal of desperation.  I know that's not ideal, but it works for me.  <br />
<br />
And for the record?  I miss Swiftmend.  Oh, how I miss Swiftmend.<br />
<br />
2. I am on a PvE server, no ganking.  In fact, I've been so pressed for WoW time of late, that I haven't even had the pleasure of running a BG as my new Big Fluffy Form...:frown: I should stop farming badges and dailies though, just for a day, and try myself on a BG.  I've never had much success taking on the &quot;enemy&quot; and I'm thinking I could actually hold my own with this spec.<br />
<br />
3. And, s3Rgio, I think it's so cool that you even have a Mage that's Kara ready.  I'm so obsessed with my Druid's advancement that my only other Toon (a shadow priest) has been sadly neglected (and I love her).  Shadow priest = fun and strong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OT:<br />
Yeah! <br />
I'm really lucky with my guild. <br />
90% players are are over 30, and im the 2nd youngest with 23 O.o<br />
It's all about helping each other and having fun together. No item-rushing or something.<br />
Ok, we needed 3 days to down archimonde in MH, but who cares...raid progression is not all ^^<br />
Good thing in my guild is, that we have 4 raids a week. And the other 3 days we usually open FFA-Raids for Twinks or PPL who need badges to Kara, ZA.<br />
Mostly we get 2 groups going and the raidleader can choose the equipment requirements: <br />
Kara = None^^<br />
ZA = Not so important(if its not a bear-mount-run), but also no blues ;-D <br />
So all who love their twinks can equip them pretty well.</div></div><hr />

My guild is full of nice people, but there isn't much commitment to helping each other gear up.  I have a couple of in game friends that work together to gear up mains and alts instead, and we do guild stuff when we manage to get chosen.<br />

I've heard the comment that 'we need to recruit people willing to gear up on their own time' more than once.  Who plays WoW without trying to improve their gear?  Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree here. <br />
Shaker is nice with the stats but The Essence Focuser http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31304<br />
is a quick AH pickup. <br />
I do like the Tears of Heaven tho. <br />
The Lei of the Lifegiver http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19312<br />
is an easy BG grind. and may replace your 68 offhand. <br />
<br />
So for a some gold and a few hours hours in AV you can save those badges.</div></div><hr />
