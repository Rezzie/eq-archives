Now i dont mean one thats half-heartedly done but one that at least gets us partway there.  Even if its a work in progress one that will be edited as finalizations are complete would be great.  Thanks in advance.  Im curious becuase im stuck on two different parts for TOB access and if i can finish it then i can post it for others to use too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">04-26-2006, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At this point PoR &quot;raid&quot; progression initially begin with group missions and then the raids start with anguish difficulty mobs/loot (such as the 3 dragons in Relic, 2 of the bone droppers in The Devastation) and pretty much from there on its Demi Plane difficulty mobs such as (maybe) Porthio, Bone dropper in Sverag, Suchun, Daosheen, Ghost, Snowtail, Sullon Zek, Deathknell. Progression is fairly easy to figure out once you start. I'm not sure what you're looking for but pretty much if by the time you are done with these mobs you aren't in demi plane, I would suggest that it's simply a waste of time.<br />
<br />
Can you elaborate on progression a bit though? Are you looking for lore progression? Group progression? Progression for a &quot;insert actualy farm zone here&quot; guild?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as OTHER &quot;high end&quot; guilds' progression you could check the Guild Progression site here:<br />
<br />
http://www.lavanet.no/progress/<br />
<br />
It automatically loads the progression for the last expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinyenya</div><div class="date">04-30-2006, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, i have done a lot of minor quests here as well Nim, what i kinda meant was is what is is this zone going to be like PoP when we get further along guild wise.  Killing Gods etc.  In Plane of Music.  I might not yet be explaining this right, im still on my first cup of coffee.<br />
<br />
On a plus note thanks for that link, i have put it on our guild Class Advisor channel so officers can get us on that progression list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">04-30-2006, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well no. I don't see it even remotely close to PoP. PoP was huge, this isn't. Also the raiding isn't just gods, its other stuff as you keep finding more about the story. The only goddess you fight is Sullon Zek up to this point. It's more like PoR progression than anything, where flagging is made by certain progression goals and quests. Deathknell and Theater of Blood (both make up the Plane of Music) arent like potime at all. Deathknell follows the Tacvi / Anguish / Demiplane line of end zone as far as I know. But hey we don't know for sure until someone beats the first event. ToB is an open zone non-instanced with mobs that flag you to deathknell provided you have killed sullon zek. etc. Assuming that's what you meant, otherwise let me know.</div></div><hr />

No it wasn't. PITA if you ask me. Back then if you didn't have a guild, you got no where. I'm still not EP flagged and only got gimped into Time. I really, really wanted to see the content and encounters tho. I hate missing 1/2 the game.</div></div><hr />

But that holds true today. Without a good guild, you won't see all the content.<br />
<br />
And to clarify, I am talking mostly about the raid encounters, including clearing, when I talk about fun. For the most part, PoP raids were quite enjoyable. PoR raids, are not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But a fun time is Daosheen. I really like that fight alot for some reason. <br />

PoR is tracking with flagging for Demi... which wasn't that much fun either. Those DoDh raids were a pain in the butt. Tier 1 Demi so-so fun so far. /shrug<br />

Vish is still a blast to me even though he is now beatable with 36 people or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I was looking at it from the stand point of fun raids that I dont mind doing over and over. DoDh 5/5 Curse raids rank at the bottom for me, for example I hope never to do HQ again (that equals not fun to me).</div></div><hr />

Just some corrections:<br />
<br />
Step 3: You need to complete both Becoming the Vessel and the Blood collection quest.<br />
<br />
The Dev bone dropper can be multiple named including Trolgar the Tremendous (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=20802) among others. Same thing with the bone dropper in Sverag.<br />
<br />
Second bolded statement is completely wrong. You do not need the the Elddar arc nor Corruption of Ro raid for progression. It's simply there for loot. You do need however Suchun which is a raid that comes after the Takish arc. The flag here will only activate if you have completed the previous steps.<br />
<br />
For step 7 you can also be other people including Tide, Township Rebellion, Raging Fury, Darkwind or Cestus Dei. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also another thing to note. Starting from Porthio raids will be Demiplane or more level. If you haven't even done decent attempts at Queen Sendaii at least then I would suggest you don't even waste your time. When the exp was out raids were kinda easy but they are now much more challenging. So caution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So here's the scoop. These changes will likely be coming in two waves, mostly depending on how long they take to get changed and through QA. <br />
 <br />
The first set of changes I'm hoping to have out to the servers sometime next week, but should be out on Test server later today. These changes are to remove the requirement that everyone needs to get the three dragon teeth and part of Porthio's staff. At least one person will still have to do those steps in order to gain access to the Daosheen raid, but those steps will no longer be required for progression in the quest. The requirement of the three events in Devastation/Rage for the quest is being removed as well. Again, someone will need to complete those steps in order to gain access to the Sullon raid, but they will not be required for the quest. Note, everyone will still need to complete the Becoming the Vessel quest. <br />
 <br />
The second set of changes will most likely appear with the next update. These changes will loosen the order restrictions currently in place on the quest. With the current state of the quest you can get credit for killing Daosheen and/or get the Glowing Shard of Mana from the Sullon raid without having done any other parts of the quest. However, currently, you would need to complete all steps in the Plane of Magic and in Devastation/Rage in order to be able to gain credit for the Suchun raid. With the changed version you should be able to do the raids, and get credit for them, in any order. Some order will still be imposed by the quest, but each person will only have to participate in each raid once, unless you choose to do it more. The one caveat to this is that each person will need to speak with the Emissary of Druzzil in the Academy of Arcane Science and obtain the Shard of Mana prior to doing the Sullon raid or they will not be able to receive credit for the raid. In each other case you should either receive credit or an item showing you have completed that raid. <br />
 <br />
Also, please note that these changes will not affect any progress anyone has already made in the quests. It will not be retroactive though. If, for example, you have already defeated Suchun but did not receive credit for it you will still need to do the raid one more time. <br />
 <br />
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on these changes. Hopefully they will go smoothly and will allow everyone to progress without any further trouble. <br />
