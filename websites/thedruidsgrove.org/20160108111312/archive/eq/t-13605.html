<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jolet</div><div class="date">03-24-2006, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know of a resource which gives a high level summary of the content from the past few expansions (OOW/GOD and onwards)? I’m not looking for strats, just a clue on how and where to access stuff. I think I’ve learned enough about DoN to be dangerous but a lot else in the game is going over my head.<br />
<br />
Here are a few questions that I would be looking to answer in such a resource:<br />
<br />
1. What the Taskmaster in my ogre’s home town is for.<br />
<br />
2. Why there are NPCs in practically every zone who simply tell me they are waiting for someone important.<br />
<br />
3. What the clockword army outside Sol A is for.<br />
<br />
4. In the lighthouse in Gunthak I stumbled across an NPC who gives tasks just like in the Tutorial. I’d like a list of other similar NPCs in the game together with the appropriate level to accept the tasks, and whether they are solo or group. And if they give upgraded armour to replace the PoK newbie gear I got, or if these are just for experience.<br />
<br />
5. I just read on the Magician’s Tower forum there is an instanced zone in Qeynos Hills. It reminded me of the instanced missions available from V’Lynn and Barrenzin in PoK. Where else can I get instances like this, do they require a group of 3, do they scale with level, is there a theme to them like LDoN/DoN or are they just one-off adventures?<br />
<br />
6. What zones do monster missions start in? I know about Highhold Pass and Icewell in server chatter, though I don’t know where to find Icewell. Isn’t that a zone off Thurgadin? – vague recollection.<br />
<br />
Basically, I’m looking for a summary of Tasks, Missions, Expeditions and Instances.<br />
<br />
Now I have played this game for many years so at least I have a general understanding of the game, but I can’t help thinking that if I am bewildered by all this stuff, how would a real newbie be managing?<br />
<br />
Of course, now that I have typed this out, it occurs to me that it might all be covered in a manual which came with the downloads, but I’m at work right now so I’ll post it anyway :)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure of a resource that has all of that information, but perhaps I can help a bit here and there:<br />
<br />
1. Not sure unless you mean the Task NPC, in which case they give out tasks to complete for xp/plat.  There are diff task NPC's for diff levels.  I think the ones in the home towns are very low level tasks.  I think I did one on my Halfling around level 12 in my home town.<br />
<br />
2. Those are generally part of the Tasks.  Most of them have you hail a particular NPC as the final task item to complete the quest.  Those NPC's respond to you with that phrase when you do not have that task item.<br />
<br />
3. Monster Mission<br />
<br />
4. I don't know where they all are, but there are 3 in Dreadlands (use Find) that give tasks for Kunark.  We visit the DL ones quite often to get tasks for Droga, Chardok, and Veks.  The Gunthak one gives tasks for Nadox, the mines, Hate's Fury, and Dulak.  These zones still give ok xp at level 65 and medium tasks give about 20% of an AA upon completion.  Plus these zones drop decent loot/plat.  The long ones in Nadox are particularly good xp.  Not much stacking loot though, so bring lots of empty, weight reduction bags.  Our guild leader (66 BL) and I easily handle Nadox and 1500 plat (each) plus 40% AA for task completion, and at least an AA for all the kills is nice.<br />
<br />
5. Not sure what that zone is.  Monster Missions are instanced zones.  You need 3+ people to start one.  Expeditions are instanced as well and you can add/remove ppl from them once you start.  I used Forgotten Halls (a test expedition off Nedaria) to level my baby toons as it is a nice, quiet place to get xp.<br />
<br />
6. Lot's of them.  The most heavily hit until they started tweaking them were the 2 in Nektulos.  In one you play as a fairy, the other as an Orc.  You used to be able to complete the fairy one in 15min, camp to an alt, do another and camp back just as the timer was expiring to allow you to do another for almost an AA per mission at lev 65.  They are less popular now that they are harder and have less xp.  Also, you didn't used to need to be in the zone to get the xp (players would AFK in the Guild Hall and have friends level them).  Now you need to loot a shard to get the xp.<br />
<br />
There are 2 in Lavastorm.  The clockwork mission that you found and the Naggy mission that starts at the NPC near the evil tunnel entrance.  Naggy is fun.  You are on the mob side of a Naggy raid and have to kill off the incoming (fake) players that come in waves.<br />
<br />
The pirate mission in Butchblock is fun.  If they haven't fixed it, the mana regen buff that one of the player types can cast gives like 100+ mana per tick.  Its like having perm BL ubercrack.<br />
<br />
Thurg got some MM's in the latest expansion.<br />
<br />
There are 3 or 4 in Undershore.  Follow the bridge off the waterfall and the big mushroom near the water gives them out.  <br />
<br />
There are other MM's as well.  Note that you will almost never use the typical zonin to get to the instanced version of the zone.  Usually you hail an NPC and get transported.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to know how to get to certain zones, you can always use the Atlas.  Bring up your map and click the other tab.  You can zoom in to any zone map (assuming you have it - see eqmaps or eqatlas websites).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
