<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayze</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'll get the carrot after I complete the quest in shimmering flats? Or will I get some type of hammer to take to ZF to summon Gahzrilla? *confused*</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Get quest in shimmering Flats<br />
2.  Get group in Gadget going to ZF<br />
3.  Kill and loot Gahz<br />
4.  Return to Shimmering Flats complete quest<br />
<br />
If you can't find anyone with the hammer, or you just want it yourself, it is in the Hinterlands.  You can find walkthroughs here somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-28-2006, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes indeed, there is a troll guy at the top of a pyramid in southern Hinterlands who drops the mallet of zul'farrak.  You need this hammer to bang the gong by the pool in ZF.  When you use hammer &gt; gong, Gahz'rilla spawns.  He's a giant hydra and he's not as nails as he looks.  Once you've killed Gahz'rilla, everyone who has the quest from teh shimmering flats can loot [Gahzrilla's Electrified Scale] or whatever it is.  Turning this into the quest guy in Shimmering Flats will give you your carrot.<br />

I can't remember the names or I would just tell you, but you need to get the hammer one place (some temple), and then take it to the altar at the top of the big troll complex with all the steps, and use it on the altar to turn it into the hammer of Zul'Farrak.<br />
<br />
It would really stink to work your way to the top of that pyramid and not have the hammer with you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't remember which quests I got up there but i know one of them was some dude on the altar. Then had to book it cause of the mobs... <br />
<br />
Will finish it up today hopefully...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayze</div><div class="date">03-03-2006, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Took a lvl 54 warrior buddy of mine along and we dared the treacherous and severely outnumbered task of summoning Gahzrilla...yeah no easy task for 2 people. <br />
<br />
We made it as far as the pool of water in front of the gong - after dying 3 or 4 times. After cowering in the corner of the pool in seal form - appears they can still take pot shots at ya with arrows in the water lol - he jumped out long enough to hit the gong and that big bastard came lumbering out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
So yeah we both died again...luckily found a lvl 60 Hunter friend of mine with some time to kill and with him, we were able to dissipate the spawn and focus on what's his face...got the carrot and now i find i hardly use it in the BGs lol (i prefer travel form)</div></div><hr />
