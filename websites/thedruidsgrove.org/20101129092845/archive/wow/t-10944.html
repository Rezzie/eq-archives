<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikerun</div><div class="date">08-11-2006, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My druid is a skinner/enchanter since my hunter could craft armors from the leather which I then disenchanted for dust and essence. Now that I'm at 300 in enchanting and my hunter is also 300 LW, should I look at dropping skinning to get a more lucrative gathering profession like mining or herbalism?<br />
<br />
I can always keep skinning, then craft, DE and sell the dust but it's kind of hard to figure out which is more lucrative. Right now, the thing that is really making me doubt is skinning dragons which yield some scales that I can sell or use to craft armors.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as the skins are put in the AH at or just below the market value they will always sell (along with most of the other basic mats in the game).  On those days where your skins have little to no competition, they will typically still be bought up to 150% of the current mv.<br />
<br />
Again this is just my experience on my server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kurannas</div><div class="date">08-30-2006, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thing about tier 3 is that i left a bwl mc guild to go with friends we are starting bwl and have mc on farm but im pretty sure we wont be in naxx before ex[pansion comes out so i feel its a waste of time to even get attuned right now, expasnion will come out,we get all the aq spells and have to start lvling all over agian so im just thingkin of the best way to make as much money as we can for when expasnions comes out so we can afford to buy our new spells, new recipes, new reagents, new mounts and anything else we would need money for lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chet</div><div class="date">09-03-2006, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dropped skinning. <br />
Now i'm enchanting/tribal and I love it. <br />
I buy my mats from guildies and I make more money D/E'ing stuff than I made skinning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">09-03-2006, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skinning was my profession since I started WoW and I dropped it last week for Alchemy because I got the recipe for Flask of the Titans in UBRS. Skinning wasn't making me any money initially because I was resto specc'ed and grinding mobs wasn't as fun anymore. If you're having a easy time with mobs and enjoy it, keep skinning. If you know where to kill mobs to get most out of your time, you can make tons of money with skinning believe me.<br />
<br />
And the rugged hide thing is a plus as well. :)</div></div><hr />

Im Ench/Elemental LW and dont regret it one bit.  It was great while leveling but now that others in the guild are somewhat assigned to skin stuff it felt like a waste, my Finkle's isnt going anywhere though :)</div></div><hr />

On that note I did drop it for a day just to make my smoking heart of the mountain but after that I picked it up again.</div></div><hr />
