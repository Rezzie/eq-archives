and questions answered in advance..<br />
<br />
Only peices with effect's stated in brackets actually have effect's on the armour peice (not all do)<br />
<br />
The leather peices for the THURGADIN Armour drops from Giants, in the Arena or Royal's area in Kael (can drop rarely in other places, but these 2 spots i found the best)<br />
<br />
The leather peices for the KAEL Armour drops in Temple of Veeshan (ToV), the zone-in is safe from mob's yet the drakes/wurms/fairies all on skyshrine faction begin right after the door leading out of the staging room, those mobs can and do drop the leather peices (unless thats changed)<br />
<br />
The leather peices for the SKYSHRINE Armour drops in ToV also, if your doing these quests the drakes/wurms that the Kael questor's kill, should be &quot;ally&quot; by now, so you can move past these with ease, once you moved out of the corridor and into a huge room with 3 other exits, first exit on the right is known as the &quot;Testing Halls&quot; there is more wurm's and drakes in there by they are KoS to everyone, and they dont give faction hits.... just armour for skyshrine quests :)<br />

<br />
Rowyls- ac67, wis40, mana235, hp30, str5, sta4, cha4, pr4, mr13, dr6, fr5, cr9<br />
NW- ac91, wis44, mana255, hp80, str5, sta2, agi15, dex11, pr3, mr17, dr5, fr8, cr8<br />
WG- ac67, wis48, mana340, hp110, str8, sta16, agi6, dex20, pr16, mr25, dr10, fr11, cr9<br />
<br />
As can be clearly seen, Rowyl's is very much the &quot;low-grade&quot; of this armor. Same AC as Woven Grass, but much less stats. On the other hand, Nature Walker's has a lot more AC and decent enough stats.<br />
<br />
I don't honestly think that Skyshrine armor will get any kind of a boost, or if it does, it will be very small, and probably in the resists.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm going after Nature Walker's, I have 200 wis already, good amount of +mana and I'd rather have pumped up AC :) <br />
