Original...or maybe I just don't know too many popular specs.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Blackrock&amp;n=Trixtaa<br />
<br />
it's the typical resto arena pvp spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:: @Veriden :: thanks for the tip! i just copied this spec from some random druid on a really high rated team =(</div></div><hr />

Empowered Rejuvenation is more important to max than Nature's Focus; more healing.<br />

(bear in mind, it was when I was in a guild [left yesterday], so it was a MT/Max DPS/Arena spec)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-12-2007, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@RESTOMANIA, what do you want to do? I'd give it an 8/10. You're missing an important talents for PvE raiding: Subtlety. <br />
<br />
I get &quot;up there&quot; enough times without Salv and that's with -2% threat enchant and that talents, I would highly recommend getting it. Without it, you're asking to be kissed by bosses.<br />
<br />
Nature's Reach may only be useful in PvP, but even then it's questionable since you're busy running around all the time. I don't have that talent, and I've never had any real issues reaching people with my balance spells.<br />
<br />
Naturalist is also pointless. Even at 3 seconds, our Healing Touch is too long. It's not worth the 5 points just to drop it .5 seconds. And without being feral, you'll get no use from the melee attack bonuses.<br />
<br />
Living Spirit is also useful if you're in Tree Form enough. Tree Form's aura grants additional healing based on your spirit. More spirit == larger HoTs.<br />
<br />
Just my opinions.</div></div><hr />

What's your focus? You seem quite erratic in what you want to do. That spec is completely different (sans it being Resto focused) than your original spec.</div></div><hr />

iam trying to focus on pve healing in your opinion what one is better the first one or second one?:deadhorse</div></div><hr />

No dead horse beating here. Asking these questions are the only way to learn.<br />
<br />
Your first listed one was better, and only needed a few minor edits. The change you did went way into the PvP realm. As a PvE healer, you don't need any feral talents. And you need Tree of Life if you're solely looking at healing. Tree of Life is highly efficient.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, as for everybody else; why are you posting feral stuff here? come on! It's the resto form! I've moved your posts to the Feral form: http://wow.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=12191</div></div><hr />

This whole topic really belongs in The Emerald Dream, since all it is is rating the druid above you.  Not Feral/Resto/Balance only.  :P</div></div><hr />
