I've had a resto druid 4 a while now and he has most of the pvp gear from the bgs. I am lvling a feral druid now. <br />
<br />
Since I really do not want to pvp for my gear again, because the bg thing just has lost its appeal to me and I really dont run too many instances at all I have taken up skin/lw.<br />
<br />
My question is, would the elemental path be better to get the Primalsrike gear rather than the Tribal for the windhawk gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thx all</div></div><hr />

The Windhawk set it mainly for either a moonkin setup or Resto set up.  Though with enough badges you can get pretty much the same gear.</div></div><hr />
