Take a right as soon as you can and one more right you will enter a garden looking area the vendor is to your right as you walk into that area. On a side note this is how I made some of my money for my mount By a couple extra and put them on the AH one at a time. You can easily make 100%+ profit on the books he sells. Hope this helped. If you are Horde I have no idea where the vendor is.</div></div><hr />

Yeppers, for Horde these books are in Brakenwall Village. This is a mid 30's + contested zone so beware going in the first time. (Stealth kitty rocks!) There is a flightpath once you make it into the camp for an easy ride out. <br />
<br />
The vendor is an Orc female that hangs out behind some big machines. <br />
<br />
(btw, the tip about buying copies of these books to sell at AH is a good one. Set buyout at double the cost of and they go fast.)</div></div><hr />

Thx for the tip ya'll...I just picked up all 3 books.  Gotta love that 1st aid, even if you are a Druid.  Cast that rejuv and 1st aid bandage and you're g2g, hardly any mana/downtime.</div></div><hr />

I miss when bandages had no cast timer(except linen bandages) but were insta cast and applied as a heal over time =/</div></div><hr />

Especially during combat, I like to apply bandages to group members and save my mana for big heals. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am thinking I can work in some root and bandage or sleep and bandage strategies into my repetoire to keep my mana conserved from shifting and casting heals, and increase my grinding speed through less downtime.<br />
<br />
Even in instances, I usually don't have aggro and can help the MH by applying some bandages to other melee classes around me.<br />
<br />
I think it will help bring moonkin closer to bear, in that I can get about as much healing as a normal frenzied regen, and the cool down is shorter. <br />
<br />
 Does anyone know if Barkskin will prevent interrupting bandaging from taking normal damage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">06-12-2006, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh well, that rules out some of my ideas, but I still think it will be an important new source of some free healing (at least when I am not getting hit on).<br />
<br />
Its sort of odd that I never thought about it before, I guess I always figured I didn't need first aid because I could heal, I wonder how many other healers don't level first aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">06-12-2006, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love my first aid. No wasted mana on healing myself between pulls and when I have no aggro I can heal myself without shifting and than right back to damage dealing. Plus healer the healers that I have grouped with love the fact taht they don't have to heal me very often. Usually the only trime I need a heal is when I offtank or the tank goes down and I have to tank. Which in most cases I shift regrowth rejuv and go bear to handle the multiple enemies.</div></div><hr />
