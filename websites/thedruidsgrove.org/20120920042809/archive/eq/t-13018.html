<br />
I started off an alt this morning and buff'd as normal (hp,regen,sow,str,ds) and unleashed the little terror. The 1st couple of kills resulted in zero exp so I assumed the alt had done no damage. I watched the next few kills and even though I landed a hit or two the kill resulted in zero exp.<br />
<br />
I then DS'd my main and pulled a mob onto him, however even though my alt landed some damage the kill resulted in no exp again. My Druid main was listed as killing the mob although the only damage was from my DS and my little alt.<br />
<br />
I tried my alt with a DS potion and it worked as expected. <br />
<br />
It is almost as if the DS credits any damage to the caster.<br />
<br />
I run out of time to test anymore so I was wondering if anyone else had seen the same results I encountered ?</div></div><hr />
