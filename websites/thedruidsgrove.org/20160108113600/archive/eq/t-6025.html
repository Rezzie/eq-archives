I was leaning toward EQ2 but after seeing virtually the same class tree, I'm probably going with WoW (if it's everything I've read and heard) and parting forever with Evercamp. Anyway, select above.</div></div><hr />

EQ/EQ2/WoW<br />
<br />
Be a long while before either EQ2 or WoW is out, so might end up just being EQ2/WoW and maybe some other game</div></div><hr />

<br />
See atm im playing FFXI....because EQ is dead imho....however im waiting for either<br />
<br />
a) better EQ expansion (not expecting it)<br />
b) WoW<br />
c) EQ2<br />
<br />
So really hard to pick an option ......im pretty sure alot of people are doing the same...maybe not with FFXI but with other games.<br />

WoW sounds interesting, but what I am really looking forward to is the mysterious game from Sigil ... The return of the Vision (tm) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">01-04-2004, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently looking for a game that my real life friends play that I can play with them without having to go to their house and play console games. This is how I got into everquest in the first place... had a bunch of friends all on same server they lived 70 miles away from me, so good way to do stuff with them without the long drive there to hang out all the time. Problem was when I started eq they were all 50to 50+ back when hate fear sky was the end game zones and other problem was the amount of hours I could play and when I could play working 2nd shift for a few years versus a bunch of guys and girls in college. Spent most of my time soloing and catching up as well as having fun while I did it. By the time I hit 50+ they were 60 spread out in the various high end guilds on my server. By the time I hit 60 most of them did not even play, by the time I hit 65 no one played cept me.<br />
<br />
So, spending time bored out of my mind looking for something else that I can play that would be fun to do with friends either players I met in game in everquest or real life friends. WOW looks fun but I do not want someone to PK me when I am on the crapper or something, would enjoy dueling and arena based pvp when consensual. Star Wars seems like yes it might be the best game in a few years when there is stuff to do and bugs are fixed... not going to pay to play a game I currently consider to be crappy.  I think the sigil game might be ok but gotta learn more about it.</div></div><hr />

I might go the route of going to EQ 1 and EQ 2 or not playing any mmorpgs at all. Sure mmorpgs are fun and such but it can bored fast and can really stress you out sometimes heh. I don't really like WOW much cause I hate the carton like graphic. :(</div></div><hr />

I'm having a lot of fun in CoH and leveling slowly.  The timing seems like it might be right to move on to WoW once it's released as I wasn't lucky enough to get into beta.</div></div><hr />
