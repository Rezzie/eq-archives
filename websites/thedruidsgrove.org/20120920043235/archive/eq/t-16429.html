The highest one, Karana's Rage, is only level 63. 1100 damage per mob isn't much when you're quadding level 80 mobs with 100k HPs.  They can practically regen that while you get into position to cast again. <br />
<br />
I think I read somewhere that EQ developers never intended druids to be able to get xp by quadding so the decision was made never to give us a more powerful quad nuke.</div></div><hr />

Not that you'd really want to tho - its very inefficient.<br />

I have quadded spiders in Icefall - just to say I have, but it takes waaay too long for the rewards.</div></div><hr />

Had to add dots to them during the quad to hasten the process. It's more for the challenge. It's faster to root-rot them. But no offense to druids who like to root-rot but I consider that technique rather boring and unchallenging in most situations. Quadding was always more fun and no matter how well you knew a camp there were still enough risks in quadding 4 hard-hitting mobs (Plane of Fire tables, anyone?) that it added an element of excitement to druid soloing that root-rotting couldn't even begin to approach.</div></div><hr />
