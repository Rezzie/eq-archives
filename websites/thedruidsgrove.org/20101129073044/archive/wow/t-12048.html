I was down to ~75 health when I defeated Tethis (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=197).  I would think the 2 adds in Big Game Hunter almost certainly make an order of magnitude harder.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
BTW, I didn't see the obligatory &quot;Piece of Cake.  I solo'd this with my lvl 17 Druid&quot; comment in the quest comments.  So, I have to think it must be quite difficult.:p</div></div><hr />

I almost always need to use a pot to get by and still haven't figured out the best approach when dealing with elites.  Bear DPS is just so low it becomes a battle of STA to see who wins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Root from distance - moonfire - wrath or starfire (repeat as long as root holds) - moonfire then Rejuv when the roots break - cat - Rake - claw - claw - claw - rip - rake - shift/Warstomp/heal macro - bear - maul ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
It usually works, but sometimes I have to shift/stomp/heal sooner or bash and shift/heal from bear as well.<br />
<br />
King B and his cronies? Definitely bring friends. The combo of his attack speed and the two of them is killer.</div></div><hr />

Barkskin helps a lot here.<br />
How i did it:<br />
clear area around hill<br />
Root Bangalash -&gt; kill adds with catform -&gt; root breaks -&gt; hybernate bangalash -&gt; finish killing adds -&gt; heal -&gt; innervate<br />
-&gt; when adds come -&gt; root/hybernate bangalash -&gt; go on adds<br />
-&gt; kill bangalash<br />
<br />
i used 1 healing-pot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">09-26-2007, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just hit lvl 44 lastnight and I have 2-3 more quests in STV before I leave.  So, maybe I'll give it one try, but I'll need a good game plan.<br />
<br />
According to wowhead, the adds don't appear until bangalash is at 50% health.  <br />
<br />
So, to get him to 50% I should root/nuke until root breaks, stomp, cast 2 HoT, go into Bear?<br />
<br />
When adds appear...<br />
<br />
 bash Bangalash switch to caster stomp(?),  hibernate bangladash cat form adds. When hibernate finishes, barkskin(?), hibernate, heal, innervate (better make sure that's on my bar somewhere) catform adds caster, pot, bear form bangalash<br />
<br />
Do cat bleeds break hibernate?  IOW, should I avoid cat form on bangalash until after the adds have been taken care of?  Should I wear my +STA gear (less agi, less strength, less kitty AP) or my kitty gear (more agi, more strength, less sta)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fairly certain they come really soon after you start on him.  I beat him down until I had enough rage to bash him.  I bashed him.  Hibernated him.  Then cat formed the adds.  Then hibernated him again.  Then healed up.  Then took him down.  I might have had to stun him and heal a few times, but it wasn't too bad.</div></div><hr />
