Totem of the Wurines - Elder Longshadow Task #1 (zone wide random on EASY instance- must have group lvl average of less than 65)<br />
<br />
I got a similar item called Feral Guardian Channeler as a zonewide rare from Longshadow 5 (normal), if that helps any.<br />
<br />
Actually, that reminds me.  Is there anyone that has both of those clickies?  And if so, are they on separate timers?</div></div><hr />

And the drops are different from the &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; instances. Unfortunately, if it is that rare, your time in the &quot;normal&quot; instance is really going to slow down the experience. :(</div></div><hr />

(Possibly under 68?)  Apparently you get an even easier version of the task if the average level of the group is low enough.</div></div><hr />
