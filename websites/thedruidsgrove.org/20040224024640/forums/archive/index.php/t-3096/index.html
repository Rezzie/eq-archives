<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that the drop rates have been increased, I was curious how much others were paying for the Ornate Leather patterns, or how much you would pay?<br />
<br />
I just bought the boots for 60k.  I've seen some other pieces ranging from 80k to 150k.  I've noticed the 150k items seem to quickly get lowered to 100k now.  How far do you think they'll drop?  Are the drops really becoming this common?<br />

<br />
I didn't buy it.. didnt have the dough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Prices are hovering around 25- 35k atm and I still think that's to high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I bought:<br />
Ornate Leather Pants (pre-drop rate change) - 40k<br />
Elemental Leather Gloves - 50k<br />
Elemental Leather Boots - 100k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I paid 50K for boots last night.  In fact, I had to sell some valuable tradeskill supplies to get the quick cash.  I will likely wait on the other stuff, but Mana Pres IV is just too valuable to take a chance on.<br />
<br />
FYI, Gloves were also 50K, Tunic was 135K and pants were 70K.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bixle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">current prices on torv:<br />
<br />
100k for tunic<br />
65k for boots (though I still see them for 100k a lot)<br />
40k for gloves (pre patch) - now I see people selling for 60 :P<br />
40k for pants (pre patch) - people trying to sell for 70k now<br />
100k for sleeves<br />
70k for helm - dunno if anyone actually buys these crappy things though, for most druid w/ mask of the forest or stalker it sucks.<br />
<br />
never seen a bracer for sale.<br />
<br />
Kinda weird that the prices on the pants and gloves have gone UP even though they're more common now. (Maybe has to do with removing the flagging restriction from the quest, causing greater demand). I hope the prices on the other pieces go down even more though.<br />
<br />
Effect on pants and tunic is great.  Effect on sleeves is so so - only affects nature's infusion for the most part anyway.  I use winter's frost + mage earring over summer's flame for the most part so the glove is not so great. Effect on boots is ok, bracers are good and the helm really sucks.<br />
<br />
They did explicitly state they were increasing ornamental drop rates in latest patch.  Let's hope they don't nerf it.<br />
<br />
*Edit - forgot other classes than druids use leather ;)  Monks/BL needing better vision may account for the high prices on the leather caps.  I'm assuming their effect is also plainsight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bjond</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">.. but ornate leather for monks is truly pathetic.  The only items I could see a monk using would be the chest and the legs -- not to wear, but only to swap in and click.  None of the ornate leather is worth wearing for a monk.  I had better gear than ornate at level 40 pre-pop as a monk.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I also have a druid and ornate is pretty fantastic stuff for a druid.  I could really see gearing a druid in nearly full ornate and being happy with it.  Unfortunately, ornate of any stripe is pretty much never sold on FV.  Legs and bp are rarely sold, typically for 200k+.  Can't imagine anyone paying that much and unless the same person is farming the same items over and over and over, they're not selling well (understandable at 200k).  I've see boots and gloves exactly once each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">24.5k for gloves today. Real steal :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tham Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just FYI. Ornate is dropping like candy off Sol Ro yard trash mobs. Check your bazaar to find out. 30+ Ornate items on BB bazaar and counting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Role Meggido</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd expect ornate prices to settle tremendously.<br />
<br />
Before the changes bp and legs were going for around 70 and 35 k respectively.<br />
<br />
I'd expect leather prices to settle into something like the following ranges with price nominally around the center:<br />
Helm 9 - 15 k<br />
Bracer 20 - 30 k<br />
Boots 18 - 23 k<br />
Arms 15 - 25 k<br />
Gloves 10 - 17 k<br />
<br />
Otherwise stated I think pricing for ornate pieces will fall by 50 percent in the next month or two.  Prices may fall even farther than that but I think it's a reasonable first take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Considering it's a high end piece of armor, the stats on the Wanderer's items aren't that impressive.  The cap and gloves for example are poor.  And the stats on the other gear isn't all that far removed from Elysian which any lvl 52 can get now.<br />
<br />
The really nice thing about the Wanderers is the effects.  FT2 on Bracers, IH4 on the sleeves, MP4 on Boots, 25Pt group regen on the Tunic, and root on the legs (which lasts quite a while).<br />
<br />
I really wouldn't waste my time or plat on the gloves and cap though.  And if I wasn't awarded those other items, I don't think I'd bother chasing them in the bazaar.  On some, I'd lose stats just to gain an effect.  I can wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm mostly curious to see whether drops are going to be nerfed or not. So I would not expect prices to go too low until we are sure that the drop is not going to change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>smeeha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would be willing to pay 20k each, for boots and arms at this point.  Hopefully it'll come lower, but for what I would use those effects for, I would pay that.<br />
<br />
I hope the prices drop to that soon, because I don't think they're going to scale the drop-rate back at all.  The only other major armor that non-uber guild players have at this point is SkyShrine and PlayerMade.  SkyShrine armor was simply okay at level 55-59ish.  I don't even use SS arms or tunic because the stats aren't as good as elysian.<br />
<br />
This new drop rate is a good thing.  It's a good things for casual players, family guilds, and mid-sixties players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brumuur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I too am planning to wait till the prices drop to a more reasonable rate.  The gear has good stats and would be nice to free up a couple spell slots but I for for one tire of seeing these larger guilds price fix these types of items.  Like most high end items, by the time that the average casual player gets around to being able to obtain these items, the price has fallen severly and if you spent that kind of PP on it, it is difficult to get your original investment back...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Role Meggido</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What they should also do is add the ornate effects to the elemental trade skilled armors so that it is more viable.  At this point the stats on elemental tradeskilled are appropriately better but people will be tied to teh effects of ornate.  Now that ornate is &quot;relatively&quot; common there should continue to be improved stat gear available short of elemental.<br />
<br />
It isn't like elemental trades skilled stuff isn't effectively obscenely rare anyway, at least vs elemenental.  <br />
<br />
Ornate is just wondeful because it finally puts focus effects in a reasonably accessable reach.  I should add &quot;about time&quot; to this, but really it's looking a gift horse etc.  Statwise it's not amazing, at least for the bulk of pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>smeeha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I completely agree with the above, only if they put a required level of 60 on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Baeffwinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Leather has dropping very steadily in sol ro tower and BoT from what i have been seeing.  I'd predict that, unless they downgrade the drops soon, prices will increasingly go down.<br />
<br />
Personally I've been farming sol ro for a while and have seen lots of drops, including 5 ornates in the span of a few hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Prices are dropping fast already.  I checked the bazaar on a few servers last night, and there was tons of Ornate for sale on each.  I even saw Bracers for sale, which I thought would be quite rare, since they offer FT2.  Same with Arms.  <br />
<br />
It's a good sign.  As the drops continue the prices will keep falling.  Soon, we can all run around with full sets of Wanderer's in our backpacks for the effects :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>netura emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">for 18k tonight, but usually they sell for 30k i think, from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rheims</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Maybe they recently nerfed the drop rates, especially in that one zone where it was dropping a lot. There was on average 20-25 pieces for sale at any given time on my server a couple weeks ago (I couldn't play so had my trader up for a few days a lot and paid attention). About 10 now if you're lucky. Prices have stabilized and risen some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Role Meggido</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Also possible that the price point has moved to more readily corespond with price takers.  For example: there may be demand for 15 sales a day at price A but something like 75 pieces a day at price B.<br />
<br />
It could just be that you are seeing market stabalization and not nerfed drop rates.  I have no idea personally, but I offer this out there.<br />
<br />
Also, I would adjust my final settling prices down perhaps 3 - 5 k each.  I think there is a tremendous market for Ornate in the 6 - 12 k each price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rheims</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I made my nerf comment based on the reports of a friend of mine who has access to SolRo and hunts there. Says it was nerfed to be more in line with drop rates in BoT whereas previously it had been dropping much more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Morell Thule is kinda funny, bracers of any class are still running 70k.<br />
<br />
Chain/plate arms 55kish<br />
Leather/silk arms 30kish<br />
<br />
silk hats are the cheapest at 8500pp<br />
<br />
breastplates and legs all run over 100k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Saraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Same has happened on Xegony--there have been far fewer pieces for sale for a week or so now then there were prviously.  I was waiting till price on wrists dropped more but now I've only seen them a couple time and at way too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>CountessKrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot;The really nice thing about the Wanderers is the effects. FT2 on Bracers, IH4 on the sleeves, MP4 on Boots, 25Pt group regen on the Tunic, and root on the legs (which lasts quite a while).&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok I have a couple question on this comment.<br />
<br />
1) Is FT2 something worth having at the sacrifice of other important things? I mean does adding 2 points of mana regen even do much of anything if you have KEI or Tranquility etc up and Mask of Hunter and Nine? To me the answerr ot that is that the percentage increase is so small that it is not a major factor.<br />
<br />
2) Point one affects 2 of the items you talked about. If i get teh bracers adn add the FT2 i lose two extremely good Bracers with high AC and high wisdom. Is it worth it even for total of FT4? I dont think so but I am not sure.<br />
<br />
3) Second item affected by point one is the boots. If I get rid of my Boots of Flowing Slime (FT2) ans use the new MP4 boots am I coming out ahead or behind? The big plus is I can buy the boot pattern for 20K adn sell the Slime boots for 80K. :-) But which one is really better? Does the price indicate taht FT 2 is worth 4 times as much as MP4? My view is the MP4 should be worth 4 times what FT is but hey again that is just my gut feeling. It seems to me like using less mana is better than being able to regen all the mana you wasted. :-) For example the Gloves are awesome. When I cast Summers Flame with them on my mana bar does not even move noticeably. Bet I could cast like 20 of them no problem.<br />
<br />
4) I am also not excited about having regen on the BP. Like I cant cast it myself every 30 minutes or so (forget the exact time on this). And the rest of the BP is not really all that much better than the Elysian. This BP should be at least 30 AC not 25. Total joke to be 25 AC when common Druid BPs are 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have yet to a single case where an item's price gradually went UP over time, unless the item or access to the item was nerfed.  It just doesn't happen, because the more people farm, the more supply there is, and the less demand there is (because people are constantly acquiring the item and it never goes away).  If you are seeing less of the item and with higher prices, it signals a nerf.</div></div><hr />
