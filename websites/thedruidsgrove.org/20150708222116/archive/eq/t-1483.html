After all there are a ton of useless spells in our book because creatures that are clearly animals are not tagged as such (plus Dire charm is in the mix).</div></div><hr />

By the time you get it there is nothing that is low enough level for you to charm that you would bother charming.<br />
<br />
Making our Dire Charm plant and animal based would actually open up some more possibilities to us. Or just make all our charm spells work on either and we could be using Call of Karana in FG and Scarlet Desert.<br />

Fungi and plants are different Kingdoms. So technically the fungi in Fungal Grove are not plants. That  being said, I believe I read that our Charm Plant spell not only works on Cacti in Overthere but also the Fungus Men in Swamp of No Hope. However, Old Sebilis Fungus Men are not affected by the spell (level restrictions?). So I don't know what's the deal here. Option is to either remove fungi from plant line all together or include it under the influence. One low/mid level spell for plants seems to be an incomplete spell line.<br />
<br />
I'm in favour of an Animal Slow spell (we have Animal Tash/Charm/Fear/Haste) however I'd prefer to see the raiding abilities of Druids corrected first. Any changes to our animal line will certainly help our xp'ing.<br />

I realize this was brough to their attention when Kunark was released and the answer was something about them being undead. I do not think that is the case anyway.  Even if they are undead, they are undead animals,  do they prevent enchanters from charming things that are undead or animals?</div></div><hr />

An undead animal is unnatural and a Druid's power deals with the natural, so I can understand their reasoning. I've added it to the list because it is/was an animal.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can mez/charm everything that falls within the level range of the spell except those mobs flagged as uncharmable (particular giants in Kael). Interestingly enough Necromancers can also mez anything like Enchanters but are restricted to undead mobs for charm.<br />

<br />
I've said similar before. When someone says it would be imbalancing to tag ALL animals AS animals, and ALL plants AS plants, I point to exhibit A: the Enchanter. With only occasional and few exceptions, a 60th level chanter can charm ANY non-named mob type provided it falls within level range, and in fact can charm most named mobs as well.<br />
<br />
I believe that chanters should be able to charm sentient life forms (basically, those with language), and druids should be able to charm &quot;dumb&quot; animals and plants. That, to me, would be far more balanced game-wise, and definitely more true to traditional RPG charm distinctions.<br />

Given that frogloks can be wizards (INT casters), they'd technically qualify as humanoid more than ogres, shamans, vah shir, barbarians... hmm... even woodelves and dwarves. <br />
<br />
Besides, do you know how much skill and coordination it takes to cast a spell while landing a perfect backflip? We can't even cast a level 1 spell while walking a step or two... ;) <br />

<br />
Kingdom Animalia pretty much encompasses anything that breathes, with the exception of a few single-celled organisms, fungi and some plants and the like.  Everquest was not based on the scientific classification of Animals.  Instead it was based on a AD&amp;D definition of &quot;animal.&quot;  <br />
<br />
So break out your old 1st and 2nd edition AD&amp;D rules - you'll see that the &quot;everything&quot; tag was hold/charm monster  There were restrictions for Dominate Animal, Plant and Person.  Various things that looked like animals could not be dominated with the &quot;animal&quot; spells because they were undead, planar, or something similar.<br />
<br />
The short of it is that Animals in Everquest are not defined by Kingdom Animalia.</div></div><hr />

If it's because you think druids have no influence over insects, take another look at our main DoT line.  What do you think we are summoning and controlling but swarms of insects?  If we can control insects en masses, we certainly should be able to control insects one-on-one!</div></div><hr />

Frogs are animals but frogloks are human-like (anthropoid). If humans undergo lycanthropy to become werewolves, then by some dark magical art humans were mixed with frogs to become frogloks. Frogloks and the like, are greater than mere animals with their human-like abilities, so go beyond the realm of the Druid animal spell line.<br />

Aye, that much is clear. Norrath is not Earth and perhaps a reasonable explanation would be animals on Norrath are not the same as on Earth. <br />

Considering that worms are qualified as animals in EQ, I'm not sure why insects are left out. Would you call the humble earthworm an animal or a worm? Scirocco raised the important issue of the need for consistent Druidic influence.<br />

heh, wrong guess. If your computer ran close to a slide show in SoL like mine does I think you'd visit Umbral as infrequently as I do, much less hunt there. I knew someone would pick me up on that, thus the question mark. I've read there is a charmable mob in Umbral. In fairness to Verant it's appropriate to list high level content that is can be influenced by the Druid animal line. So, what is it?<br />

<br />
The Druid Class was poorly thought out back in '98 '99 and it lead to lines of spells that would be overpowering if we could do it all.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that we have entire lines of animal control type spells they have told us time and again that to give us the same type of control over animals that chanters have would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Let's be honest here... most of the non-humanoid type mobs could be considered animals in the traditional sense but technically there is no difference between a Lizardman and a Lizard - both are animals.<br />
<br />
What does make the difference is the level of intellect so to speak. This allows Verant freedom to choose what they think we can charm and what we cannot.<br />
<br />
This is the difference between an Animal Charm and a regular charm that can charm almost anything.<br />
<br />
Our charm spell is not powerful enough to charm mobs that have a certain level of intellect.<br />
<br />
Now clearly a few mobs do not make sense but most do.<br />
<br />
Undead of course being the exception.<br />
<br />
Maybe if, instead of charm animal we could simply have the same charm as chanters but have all mobs tagged with an &quot;intel&quot; number. We could do Lessor Charms and Chanters Greater Charms which would mean that we could charm the &quot;dumb&quot; stuff while they could do &quot;smarter&quot; mobs.<br />
<br />
Maybe this would have been a better way to do it or maybe I'm just losing my mind again :)</div></div><hr />

The hornets there count as &quot;summoned&quot; creatures. Therefore, since they're not exactly from our plane of exsistence (being summoned to fight here, and all...) they shouldn't count as animals.</div></div><hr />

When I was in my 20's Charming the apes was a basic part of fighting the temple.  If they base the druid on having power over nature then we should have the ability to charm plants and animals AND they should be tagged properly. <br />
<br />
The tags ARE NOT alined with D&amp;D or Apes, lizzards and some of the other animals would be tagged since they are listed as animals in D&amp;D and not treents and griffons.  Why can we charm some apes, raptors and spiders and not others? <br />
<br />
As for the spell being overpowering.  Remember back when you charmed that griff and it plus it's target both ripped you to pieces when the charm broke...  I do.. <br />
<br />
There are enough limits on our control.. <br />
one: level limits which should be removed at the higher levels. <br />
Two: the animal tries to kill us when it breaks.  and <br />
three: we can only charm plants and animals.  We cannot charm humanoids, undead, giants, dragons, etc...   <br />
<br />
If they tag all the plants and animals properly they can take the tags off the Griffons and Treents and even make restrictions like no &quot;Giant Animals&quot;, fungus or insects which we could live with.</div></div><hr />
