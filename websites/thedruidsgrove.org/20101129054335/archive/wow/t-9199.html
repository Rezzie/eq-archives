My roots only lasts 5 secs, often doesn't work at all. We tried where he just stood there and i cast roots. Alot of times it showed he was immune. When i try to heal, he just kicks me and my spell is interrupted. Then his posion daggers slow down my healing. I can't root, I can't heal. How am I supposed to beat him? I have my druid set almost exclusivly as restoration exept for natures grasp.</div></div><hr />

Save Nature's graps for an instant full-heal.  Also, rogue's poison can be cured.  And kick is pointless when you are in Bear Form.  And if you spec for it, you stun will last for 4 seconds, which is alot of time to reapply Regrowth + Rejuvination.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry dude.. when you hit higher levels, rogues will be cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jamesmd</div><div class="date">09-03-2005, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agrre with the above thread - dont worry about killing other toons until ur higher level - druids come into thereown when you have been able to spek up. After 40 I had no problem with rogues - they are very squishy and tend to panic after there initial attack hasn't killed the target - rember, in effect you have a healing warrior  to take the b'stards down. In fact other than shamens I cant think of a class that i am scared of (it was also the mage until they nerfed the polymorph spell - evil LOL). BTW slightly OT how do u kill a good Shamen?</div></div><hr />

You're only hope against a shaman is to run them out of mana. And a good one won't run out before you.</div></div><hr />

I used to duel a lot when I was younger level and almost gave up my Druid coz I was frustrated with losing most the time. Then I get some levels and now I wouldn't want to PVP with any other char.<br />
<br />
All my mates call me unkillable coz they're all dead way before me in battles and most of the time I don't die at all as I have the means to escape a situation where we've wiped.</div></div><hr />

I believe that's hibernation, spam regrowth/rejuv, and hearthstone. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ciwt</div><div class="date">09-14-2005, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a great tip against shamans that i use is, when your low on mana, go travel form and.. run away! Then hi will likely ghost wolf and run after you, then you quickly go to caster again and hibernate him. You often got way more mana regen / spirit than a shaman , and you can attack him with either.. Catform, or nuke him.<br />
<br />
I use to when i bandaged up, starfire, moonfire moonfire, He starts to heal often, or else, moonfire, moonfire, then he heals, bear, feral charge. hit him, hit him, hit him, he heals again, bash, hit hit hit hit hit, maybe a moonfire or two :) And if hes still not dead, and your a tauren, you still got warstomp... That should do it</div></div><hr />
