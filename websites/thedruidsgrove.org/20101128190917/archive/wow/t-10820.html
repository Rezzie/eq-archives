It will be a pain the butt to level though because you will get camped regularly by 60s and if you kill a lowbie, expect for him to login his main and bring 10 buddies from his guild. lawl gg carebear alliance</div></div><hr />

I have seen quite a few guilds recruiting, some of them fairly large so they would probably welcome a balance druid.  Most of the larger guilds seem to welcome more of a diversity in classes than the smaller ones (but that is not always true).</div></div><hr />
