<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TantrikMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">somehow im threatingly with her, anyone know how to fix her faction (ie what faction is she on?)<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meperidine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this is one of the shore druids in e karana? a successful hide might work if she doesnt turn around when you give her stuff.  I helped mq the vs stone while kos to that ranger in firiona vie by sneaking and making sure faction had changed with guards. Then i handed that girl something unneeded to quest to see if she would turn and aggro..she didnt.  Otherwise you got a LOT of muffin work ahead of you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you threateningly to Athele, you got bigger problems.<br />
<br />
Did you hunt in PoG?<br />
<br />
Have you tried conning the Pained Unicorn in LFay and is she KoS?<br />
<br />
Does walking through Kelethin mess up your day?<br />
<br />
If you answered yes to any of those you are screwed. You have a TON of faction fixing to do. And a TON of muffins to transport before you continue with your epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Reeny TheDruid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Turned in almost 100 stacks of muffins to be able to move on with my epic. I dreamed of muffins for days. I wish you luck and hope you can buy wholesale</div></div><hr />
