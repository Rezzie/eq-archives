Monday as I am flying over Area 52 in Netherstorm I am air assaulted by two UD mages and killed with no option but to spirit res., but thats not the bad part.<br />
<br />
 Bad part is that right after I res. My PC goes into a death spiral and crashes hard. After taking it to get it checked out it seems that the AGP slot in the MB went bad, the video card started to short, and the HD died all at once. There can be no other explanation other than bad Horde mojo   :P.<br />
<br />
 Anyways now Im left with the decision of replacing the parts that went out with similar parts for about $300-$400 dollars, or replacing with upgraded parts for about $800.</div></div><hr />

It costs 350,000 honor and 100 Eye of the Storm tokens and it's got one heck of a cooldown, but hey, it works!!!<br />

Seriously though, that sucks.  Good luck with the repairs!</div></div><hr />

My guildmate's computer fried during a raid one time and he dissapeared off of WoW for 2 months while getting it fixed (Lightning did it somehow) and it was funny because we transferred to a different server while he was gone so he got back and didn't know where we were but eventually found out and xferred himself =/</div></div><hr />

 Thanks to a very fast working freind I am back up and running. I went shopping yesterday and came home with some nice goodies. The 2 best items being an AMD 64 dual core 4600 processor and a BFG NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS OC video card.<br />
 This card looks so damn sexy I almost hated to hide it inside the machine. It makes my old card look like a wireless card or something  heh.</div></div><hr />
