<br />
We've talked alot about beta spells and such lately but I want to take a step back from that and talk about things already in game.  I would like a list of 10 or so issues which most people consider pressing and I will see what kind of reply I can get.<br />
<br />
Two I can think of right off are asking Prathun to review Lunarlight, and Merloc to add a Focus to the TBS BP (Pure Life Rank III has been suggested a few times.)<br />
<br />
Possibly requesting Prathun look at Mask line stacking also.<br />
<br />
The 'Top 10' lists are done and they are from what I am gathering working on a new format and some other minor things have changed, so we may see better results.<br />
<br />
I am mostly looking for bugs or obvious balance issues right now, and not requests for new spells or AA(since that will likely happen more during beta.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and if anyone needs to get a hold of me, you can PM me on EQlive, The Druid's Grove, send me tells in game ;tell Cazic.Fenier or an ingame mail to the same place.  I am also normally in serverwide as well.<br />

<br />
fwiw, i think AtU should be a much bigger base than it is, too. 4.5-5k base damage. if we (and mages) are the masters of killing summoned, then we should always be top dps on these mobs when chain nuking.<br />
<br />
cures. either gives us better cures or give us a version of /melody. i dunno how much TSS you have done fen, but chain casting nappae is an invitation to carpal tunnel.<br />
<br />
and cold DDs are now so efficient they don't really do squat for dps. this goes towards something that needs to be addresses overall, not just druid specific: stop making zone where ALL mobs are immune or seriously high resistant. i can see a mob model or two or 3 being highly resistant, but all mobs is ridiculous. esp end-zones, like AG and FC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solteris BP &gt; Pure Life 25% pres. Clicky needs to be changed to something heal cented, not damage centered<br />
<br />
Serpent Vines &gt; increase duration to match ensnare.  I forgot about this issue for awhile until I got to certain Solteris events.  Chain resists on ensnare is becoming lame.<br />
<br />
Immolation line of dots &gt; I'm sure it's possible to make it so two druids can stack this on the same mob (the dot portion)... Perhaps make the dot only a dot, and autocast the debuff on a separate line?  Not a pressing issue per say, just would be nice to have this addressed.<br />
<br />
Oaken guard &gt; Needs to be revamped. Preferibly to an instant cast AA verison.  But if not, it'd be nice if they reduced the cast time, removed the -hate proc, and added a heal and potent -hate shot go off upon casting.<br />
<br />
Mask of the XXXX &gt; Whole line needs a potent mana regen boost.  You need mask going for 11 minutes to med enough mana for extra heal (and that's with mana pres/scm/spec/etc filtered into the heal cost.)  Stacking issues need to be addressed as well.<br />
<br />
SotWW &gt; Change so it's mana regen, not pres.<br />
<br />
Spell lag &gt; This isn't really a minor issue, but all of our damage spell lags have lagged in progression.<br />
<br />
NBW &gt; Should be made a tad more efficienct.  ATM it is actually about just as efficienct as equinox burn (assuming 4 dot ticks), but it is not the healing/dps concurrentcy tool I dreamed off with it's current mana cost, instead, it is a GoRM spell at best.</div></div><hr />

Posts made by Prathun indicate this 'was' designed as a GoRM spell in a similar manner to EC, RS and AP.  We could ask to look at the Efficiency but I doubt the mana cost is going to come down much based on what Prathun wrote on the spell when we got it.<br />

<br />
AA Name:  Call of the Wild<br />
 Classes:  Druid / Shaman<br />
 <br />
 Issue:  If the AA returns the result - can not work at this time it (due to the person zoning, going LD, etc) the AA greys out for 10 minutes.  It would be helpful, esp due to the long recast time, to instantly reset on failure in much the same way other targeted AAs do.<br />
 <br />
 AA Name:  Secondary Recall<br />
 Classes:  Druid / Wizard<br />
 <br />
 Issue:  The AA seems to share the gate code and can fail.  This would not typically be an issue aside from the fact that the AA failing starts the 10 minute recycle.  Ideal solutions would be to make the AA no fail, or instantly reset on failure.  Presently if the AA fails you can run to your secondary bind point on foot before it resets, which kind of defeats the entire purpose.<br />

<br />
On raids, if I mem it it's either to use inbetween heals on race-the-timer events (ie Solteris event 1 phase 1), or to use against all out trivial dps events.  In other situations I don't have room to mem it.  Also need to consider the fact the only spells I use to get GoM procs from are Lunarlight and Surge... my primary blast heal is ancient.<br />
<br />
In groups, you usually don't get GoRM procs til near the end of a mob, and it's rather pointless to cast this towards the end of the mob. <br />
<br />
In any situation, if I use it w/o a GoRM proc and it resists, I usually quickly demem it to save my blood pressure from rising.</div></div><hr />

I made a post about this and it got shot down by players.  It's amazing how much stupid people can get done when they group up together.<br />
<br />
And considering players are the one who pushed to get it changed to that, I don't think the devs are going to change it back anyways.<br />
<br />

<br />
Since the devs posted that they're never going to make it so a player can stack a spell/tome aura and an item clicky aura at the time, I agree that ALL auras should be changed to instant cast mana/endurance cost free tomes.<br />
<br />
And if oakguard can't be changed to an AA, it should be changed to a tome imo.  It would be easy enough to put a tome of the spell in everyone's inventory....</div></div><hr />

Why? That was the entire point of the AA and spells for all of the pure casting classes that they got in DoDH, other than us. We were the only ones that didn't recieve a high mana cost spell in that expansion.</div></div><hr />

you are basing whether you should cast a spell taking up a gem on whether or not you get a gom/gorm? this doesn't seem a faulty design to you? to me, this pretty much says the devs know that mana costs are pretty out of whack at the general level of caster vs melee dps.<br />
<br />
don't get me wrong, i generally like NBW. sucks my mana away but i don't limit my use of it based on whether i got a gom/gorm.<br />
<br />
to me gom/gorm are mana pres tools, not dps tools. it's a freebie cast when i gom/gorm, not a requirement to be able to cast a spell for dps. hope i am getting my point across.<br />
<br />
if you need a mechanic to limit use, i'd say there are better ways. if you *shouldn't* use mana for it, make it an AA with a resuse timer.<br />
<br />
if the devs realize there are dps issues between casters and melee, address it with a solid design rather than a single spell.<br />
<br />
a) lower cast times<br />
b) raise base damage<br />
c) rework focus effects for a) or b)<br />
d) create an aa that modifies a) or b) for a limited time</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can optimize how much mana you spend by waiting for a GoRM proc.  The spell isn't meant to be used on every mob as much as it was to deal a good deal of damage quickly at a high mana cost.<br />
<br />
However, the spell is inefficient as well, so you need to be careful when and how often you use it.  The spell is aimed at giving druids a unique high damage / low efficiency damage tool.<br />

 <br />
I'd be happier to see a spell/DoT or regular shielding buff.  And/or an Endurance regen.<br />
 <br />
Even though the DS does make it pretty useless and incredibly situational, I still like for grouping or soloing. Perhaps a new SotW type group heal would be good. Though, I don't know if that'd fly with some people =P It'd probably share timers and I'm fine with that. Or like some people have suggested, a way to make the DS optional.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I agree with much of the above. I know it is not a druid specific problem but it limits many of us and that is SPELL GEMS. More please or a new kind of bar. The tome idea or whichever. I think a bar for certain types of spells only would be a good idea. Could put Reptile, Direwild, Second Life, Regen, FoE, Mask, Direwood Guard as it stands, Mammoth's etc (whatever floats your boat and you use i.e. works for everyone not just raiders) on the bar freeing up spell gems. Even 5 gems would free the burden. A fight with heavy curing of multiple types and you have to do multiple debuffs is just not enough room. Of course if they combine debuffs as I hope they will that would ease some of the problems. We get too many new lines, many of them one shot wonders, that it is impossible to use all the spells in book even if they are appropriate to the situation at hand.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">08-22-2007, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Questions aimed at Prathun:<br />
<br />
1:  When you created Nature's Blazing Wrath you said it was designed to be a high damage / low efficiency tool. We agree with this, however compared to the similar tools of other classes which fall into this category such as Ashengate Pyre, Rampaging Servant, Sting of the Queen and Ethereal Conflagration it's innate resist modifier is to low.  Would it be possible to increase the -FR check from -10 to something more in line with our other Fire DoT lines?<br />
<br />
2:  Are you still considering altering Lunarlight to be more effienct, and if so do you have a timeframe for any changes?  If Druids get a new group heal in SoF we'd like to have it based on a upgrade from the revised spell, and not the present version.<br />
<br />
3:  The changes to Fernspur and addition of NBW were to bring Druid DPS back in line with mages.  Is it possible that Mage DPS when compared to Wizards and Necromancers is presently to low, and thus inadvertently effecting Druids?  <br />
<br />
4:  Are their any plans, AA or spellwise, to give Druids a way to recover faster from death in terms of mana regeneration?  Druids are presently the lowest in terms of mana regen among all int/wis casters lacking any long reuse or strong passive activated skills to recover quickly - the only casting class to lack such tools.  This was compounded by the removal of our mask line in TSS.<br />

<br />
I so agree with this. My personal preference would be, rather than giving us a bigger spell bar (which may have problems I do not understand in the game engine similar to adding more or bigger bags), give us an instant 'spell' that swaps in a second or third pre-memorised spell set. It should load all spells in the set at the same time instead of one at a time and the more sets you want to have prepared the more gems are taken up with that particular spell, leaving less for real spells. But even one single quick swap gem bar would help so much.<br />

 <br />
Our class being the only caster class that does not get a form of yaulp/canni/harvest/gather mana/lich/mod rods/whatever really messes with us. Beasties, a hybrid class, even get this in paragon. It really affects us in all content, solo to group to raids. We have more down time period. This is doubled for getting rezzed into a raid situation, especially being a healer, getting an AE, or something that gives raid timer aggro on top of rez effects. We already have to use more mana to do less than other classes can, we really shouldn't have to deal with mana regen like we do on top of that. <br />
 <br />
Mask only being 5 mana regen is also far behind. Also must, must, must get it in another stacking spot so every AE/DoT and it's mother won't overwrite it.<br />
 <br />
I agree that basing NBW on GoM is stupid. I use this all the time without GoM. Sucks up mana, but keeps me less than completely, utterly behind others dps wise. This isn't the most pressing issue imo though.<br />
 <br />
Thank you Fenier for pushing into combine our debuffs. To me that is very important.<br />
 <br />
Oaken Guard = AA ftw.<br />
 <br />
Our cold dps needs a boost if possible. Not my most pressing concern, but I think it needs to be addressed. Ice nukes getting resisted less and/or doing more damage would help a lot. This also goes for the cold portion of Winter's Flame. I know this isn't the thread for new spells, but an ice dot imo would help a lot.<br />
 <br />
Even if we can't get the DS portion of SotW removed, I think it could use a bit more of an upgrade than it has gotten. 500 hot doesn't quite cut it compared to the amount of hp everyone is getting/damage they are recieving now. I remember this used to really help heal my group. Now the only time it heals people to full is when a cleric uses balance or I cast it after whatever AE or mob that is hitting us is dead.<br />
 <br />
Single druid buffs not overwriting group druid buffs. Such a pain in the ass every day.<br />
 <br />
Imo our most pressing issue besides mana regen is spell gems. Personally I would like to see more spell gems rather than get an AA to let us quickly switch out spells, but that is also an awesome idea. This is a huge hinderance to druids. If I am group healer in a raid I have to constantly switch out spells and wait for refresh times just to get a mob debuffed, let alone have a damage spell memmed (and then wait for it's refresh like suncorch or NBW). We have loads of spells we don't use because of this. <br />
 <br />
Something else that might fix this... is it at all possible to get refresh times taken out of play right when you mem a spell, but count after you cast it? Obviously this would need to count every time after you cast, so you couldn't just cast, unmem, remem, cast. Being able to cast reptile skin, debuffs, adrenaline surge, etc right when I mem them would be a gigantic help.</div></div><hr />

Stacking issues with Single and Group versions of our Skin line buffs.  Single will not overwrite group, even at the same rank.  Is it possible to have then overwrite each other so we do not have to ask they drop their current buff to give them a simple refresh?<br />
<br />
Stacking issues with Malo and Protection of Seasons, there seems to be an issue with it overwriting the Buff on higher versions such as Malis.  Protection of Seasons uses different slots then Circle of Seasons, which does not have this problem.  Be aware however that changing Protection of Seasons to match Circle of Seasons would conflict with the Cold Resist attached to Spirit of the White Wolf.<br />
<br />
Stacking Issues with our Mask of X line.  Many many raid encounters have mana drains, but a very large amount of those encounters overwrite the Mask line for Druids and Rangers.  This is common even on something as simple as Trash mobs in Theater of Blood (Mage AEs).  Is it possible to get the Mask Mana Regen slot changed to something not so commonly overwritten?<br />
<br />
If required I can show you just how many Raid AEs overwrite the druids only form of mana regen not shared with other classes. This compounds the problem of Druids having the lowest mana recovery of any priest and is a real issue we'd like to see addressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are questions relating to the TBS Class BP from Solteris.<br />
<br />
Item Click:  The item click is a upgrade to the TSS BP Click, which was... not very popular with Druids.  A full discussion of why can be located here:  http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums...ead.php?t=15306 (http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums/showthread.php?t=15306&amp;)<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have the click changed into something more useful at least popular? Or, at the very least not have this same click on any future Breastplates?<br />
<br />
Item Focus:  The item presently doesn't have one.  Are you considering higher powered generic focii for these items, or are you considering a single spell?<br />
<br />
Popular request for Generic Focii are stronger DPS or Healing Focii.<br />
<br />
If you are considering a Focus linked to a single spell, the most common request is Mana Preservation for Pure Life Rank III.  <br />
<br />
Would you mind sharing your plans for this item, and any ETA we can expect to see changes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It takes mask 12 minutes for mask grant as much mana as one spell gem verison of canni.  It takes mask 45 minutes to grant as much mana as one AA canni.  The average effective mana saved by white wolf is less than one spell gem verison of canni or a mod rod, making it -by far- the weakest mana tool in the game, with arguable the worst mechanics, especially for a healing class.<br />
<br />
Back to clerics... compare Pure Life Rk. III and Sacred Light Rk. I.  They are of essentially the same mana cost.<br />
<br />
Pure Life Rk. III - 3399 hp for 794 mana.<br />
<br />
Sacred Light Rk. I - 4260 hp for 795 mana.<br />
<br />
Five casts of Pure Life Rk. III will heal for 16,995 hp using 3970 mana.  Four casts of Sacred Light Rk. I will heal 17,040 hp using 3180 mana.  Lets say a druid casts 5 heals a minute on average on a raid event (which is a tad on the lowside)... if a cleric uses the same spell line (which they don't), they can heal for the same amount of hp using 800 less mana.  So a druid casting at this below-realisitic rate would need another 80 mana regen to keep up with a cleric using unrealisitic tactics.  In reality, the mana-to-hps healed different is well beyond that, but I'm using inarguable numbers to communicate my point.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This isn't just a problem with skin though. It is the same with soe vs foe, single ds vs group ds, single regen vs group regen, etc. I know that the group spells are ever so slightly better than the singles, but it is still a huge pita.<br />

Thank you so much for bringing that help. Just today I have been casting it after every third aviak who malos me in TBS<br />

 <br />
There are also many solo/group content DoTs which overwrite mask as well. I know there are a couple in The Buried Sea (the zone). There is a mob in the Widdlethorpe DoDh missions that casts a dot which overwrites mask. I have been trying for the last 20 minutes to find the name of either of these and I'm having no luck. I know there are more but I'm having a brain block.</div></div><hr />

The Slot 3 Field is the primary reason it's overwritten.<br />

If people could go through and idenitfy every AE which drains mana, I can present the list to Prathun.  I don't have time to do it till my day off next week.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Faster debuffs and/or snare would be great too. I'm tired of missing half the fight because I'm too busy trying to debuff and snare mobs. I think it would help with our DPS without stomping on the toes of other classes by asking for stronger nukes and such.</div></div><hr />

Some methods to keep druids using ooc regen longer in group fights...either doom timers, the Reptile mechanic for debuffs, something not yet in game, or a combination thereof.  OOC regen is great, but it is a relative nerf for dotting classes, non-cleric healers, etc,...<br />
<br />
That's most of my input so far.</div></div><hr />

Between healing, debuffing, and DPSing, the last thing we need is to stack our agro at a faster rate.<br />
<br />
In regards to the removal of the damage shield from our aa heals, I would suggest replacing it with either an endurance regen (not likely), or a mitigation component. It's intended as an &quot;oh crap&quot; instant heal (convergeance, anyways), that doesn't mean the mob is going to stop wailing on the recipient. An added ammount of mitigation, kind of like the AS recourse, would help us in landing a proper heal, and at the same time, be more beneficial to the person taking the damage than a damage shield.<br />
<br />
Making Origin and Secondary Recall no fail would be nice.<br />
<br />
An upgraded Mask spell is essential, in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Some sort of detrimental wolf form, to balance out the beneficial wolf form.<br />
<br />
I don't think we need more illusions. To me, it's an opportunity to be given something that we're asking for, potentially at the expense of more pressing class needs.<br />
<br />
As I said before, an alternative means of activating our aura's without having to stop, mem the spell, cast, demem the spell, reload the spell. Maybe a 2-4 slot long reuse only spell bar, for aura, direwood guard, reptile, or the ability to activate the aura/direwood guard via an aa or discipline type window button with a reuse timer.<br />
<br />
edit : our single target buffs overwriting our group buffs (kinda like every other buffing class in the game) would be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me when several trash mobs are pulled, like clearing to next raid mob, the SHM has them all slowed before I can cast one debuff and have recast time up. And this is just one of our debuffs. Forget casting more than 1 debuff type.<br />
<br />
Now you may not need all trash mobs debuffed until they are actually enguaged, like if they are mezzing some. But it's still a slow process. <br />
And mostly now days all the mobs are being off tanked at same time. <br />
<br />
In a grp setting.... if you are healing it be nice to debuff fast so you are not caught with greyed out icons and needing to heal.</div></div><hr />

We have more pressing issues.  Cast times, mana regen, combining debuffs, ds on the AE heals, and enough damage on nukes/dots to bring us up to a real utility class again would brighten my day.

Hopefully something of these will get changed soon.</div></div><hr />

how about an AA version of our debuffs with an instant cast time (being an AA, it wouldn't affect the cast times of spells)<br />

<br />
to be honest, I am getting tired of the increased number of spells with random effects that you are simply &quot;waiting for&quot;.  Dawnfire, Fernspur, and Annihilate the Unnatural are examples.  While I use all of these spells from time to time, they have effects that are so random that you can't really count on them and the spells usually end up letting you down.  I'd much rather have the ammount of damage of the spell increased a bit and the random effect dropped altogether.<br />
<br />
I am someone who likes consistent parses.  When parses on the same mob with the same spells are immensely different, it makes me sad :(</div></div><hr />
