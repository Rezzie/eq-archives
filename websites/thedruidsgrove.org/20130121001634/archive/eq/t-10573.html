If not.....how is it possible that Charming keeps Enchanter's Pets Charmed longer, yet the stat would have no effect for Druid Charming?</div></div><hr />

It has an effect on Enc charms just because of the way SoE designed the class. Why they chose to do it that way, I don't know... but I am sure a bunch of intelligent people over at SoE got together and figured it made sense. :grin:</div></div><hr />

Throw on glamour it helps, get a tash is better, get a tash and malosinia and charm may never break-haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
charisma only helps a druid in a couple of ways...<br />
<br />
to help increase money when selling and decrease when buying...<br />
<br />
charisma also helps when we have a resist while casting harmony.  Charisma is suppose to help us not get aggro when harmony doesnt land.  Distance also helps here too it is thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
I once thought, when I was much younger and not as cynical, that high charisma was necessary when travelling to bars and taverns.  I used to think the wenches there showed much more interest in me after I had the opportunity to talk to them a bit.... that and flashing me big hairy feet.<br />
<br />
well, as the years have passed,  I have come to the realization that it was the gold and platinum I was flashing (paying for me drink) that they were interested in.....  :(<br />

The main factor on charm duration will always be the mobs mr and the lvl gap between you and the mob though.</div></div><hr />

But snare and cha has nothing to do with each other</div></div><hr />

With that being said, yes i believe CHA helps with keeping charms.  My basis for camparison is PoS.  I used to have 60 CHA (had -cha items), than a few month later i had 300+ (was still lvl 65 at this point) and there were considerably less charm breaks.  Is CHA important enough where one should bag their epic / 100 hpmana OOW staffs and shields for CHA steins? prolly not -- but if you have considerably high CHA you should be gtg.  I can charm anything now be able to trust that it will stay charmed for a good amount of time.  I also never charm w/o using glamour as well.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Oh, and as a side note -- if your duoing with a BST and think it will be a cool idea to Fero the charm, think again =p.</div></div><hr />

This isnt speculation, this was said straight out by a dev (GZ I think?  Cant remember) many years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Essentially though, as long as you have over 75 ('baseline') cha, you shouldn't see noticeable negative effects on charm duration.<br />
<br />
That being said, high cha is great for making sure DI fires, and if your clerics are too lazy to cast it on you, it's available in tribute form!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menellinde</div><div class="date">01-24-2005, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to say that I believe cha has a definite affect on charm for druids.  I base that opinion on what I have seen on our numerous RZ raids.  We have at least 4 druids charming and there are some that have pets who break consistently while others have pets that last the entire fight.  My cha for example is well over 200, my pet lasts the entire fight and then some no problem.  One of my guildmates has cha around 80.. his charm breaks constantly throughout the fight, and the same  holds true for others that I have watched who have high cha or low cha.</div></div><hr />

Here (http://www.graffe.com/graffe1.0/library/skills/attributes/attributes.htm#verantquote) is a copy of the post Brad McQuaid made on the issue of stats way back on April 9, 2000 on the old official whineplay forums.<br />
<br />
CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular)<br />
<br />
Geoffrey Zatkin later expounded on it at a fan faire when cornered by angry enchanters  (there's a thread on the runes about it even now, in fact.)  And later still, he confirmed that it had no affect on druid charms.</div></div><hr />

In 2000 to 2005, there have been no revamps to charming?<br />
<br />
I don't know, there always seemed to me to be a big difference in charming between a 280 cha, and a 305 cha with mobs in the plane of tactics.  It might be a placebo affect, I dunno.</div></div><hr />

Not that were ever announced or mentioned anywhere by an official person as regards the actual mechanics of it, and they get questioned about it at pretty much every fan faire.  And at this point, the people who wrote the original charm code are long gone, and  I bet it would be more trouble than it's worth for a new coder to go back and muck around with it.<br />
<br />
If you really want to test it, be my guest... but be prepared to do literally thousands of charms under very controlled conditions, because between the inherently random nature of it and the streakiness of the EQ RNG, it'll take that many to see if there were any real effect.</div></div><hr />
