LOL, this is just insane.  There are endowments and very rich people (like Martha Steward) that may lose most of their wealth.<br />
<br />
The crux of the problem is a lack of disclosure and the inability of others to replicate his strategy.  So, why did so many invest with him?  He gave 10% returns without a down year regardless of the economy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone invested in this thing, even banks.  A whole bunch of Swiss bank, Spanish banks and so on.  I think it'll be interesting to see how widespread this is.<br />
<br />
Now, if even banks and people who are supposedly trained to understand risks and rewards can't protect themselves from this sort of fraud, why are some of you still clinging to the illusion that these industries don't need regulation? <br />
<br />
In the end we all end up paying for this, if only because everyone in the world has lost faith in our ability to handle their money responsibly.  No one is going to want to participate in hedge funds because they're so invisible to scrutiny and regulation you can do all kinds of fraudulent things.  People are already taking their money out of legit hedge funds because of this.<br />
<br />
While many investors were friends or met Mr. Madoff at country clubs or on charitable boards, even more had entrusted their money to professional advisory firms that, in turn, handed it to Mr. Madoff &#8212; for a fee. Investors are now questioning whether these paid advisers were diligent enough in investigating Mr. Madoff to ensure that their money was safe. Where those advisers work for big institutions like Banco Santander, investors will most likely look to them, rather than to the remnants of Mr. Madoff&#8217;s firm, for restitution.<br />

This from the president of a fund of fund business: &quot;Every time one of these frauds is discovered I get scared to death it could happen to us. We do lots of things to try to ensure it doesn't, such as checking and confirming auditors and auditor changes, using a private investigator to check on managers when we first invest and the having the PI annually update the file, trying to find references which are not on someone's reference list, etc.&quot; If big investors like these could be fooled, he said, anybody can be fooled.<br />

<br />
Yea, this guy had exceptional credentials.  He was involved in the first electronic trades and gave lectures on the stock market.  <br />
<br />
The slippery slope for him may have been on the first down year where he goosed his numbers.  Then he may have just doctored his accounts after that and after the 40% decline in the stock market.  What ended this was overseas redemptions.  Once people wanted their money back, the whole thing fell apart.<br />
<br />
I think it is very important to diversify and to avoid these fund of funds things.  That means no more than 20% invested in a single mutual fund or stock or bond...</div></div><hr />

One of the articles I read today someone had put their entire retirement account into this thing.  I wonder if they're getting lead into these things by their financial advisers they hire and pay?  Sounds like a lot did.  I think ultimately greed can overcome the best of us though.  It *is* hard to diversify out of a something that is earning you 12% a year, good economy or bad.   <br />
<br />
I had to really pinch myself hard to get myself to take some money out of this one fund I had, it was just such a great performing fund for so many years.<br />
<br />
Still, due to diversification and laziness (never got around to buying more mutual funds after I consolidated into one, it's in the money market account still) I have only had small losses so far. *knock wood*</div></div><hr />

Honestly, you at the same time say that people are not responsible for their own stupidity, you say that they are stupid, and that they need to be protected because they are stupid.  If you made people responsible for their own stupidity, then you would have less of the second, and would not have to do the third.<br />

Short selling IS gambling.  It is not investing.It was not a risky investment.  It was a Ponzi scheme.  They were paying back old investors with the funds coming in from new investors, as if it were a real return, while pocketing a part of the money themselves.<br />

Fraud, plain and simple.<br />

If you walk into a casino and keep pulling on a slot machine because you think you will make money in the long run, you are stupid, and should not be protected.<br />

Rather than reiterate what I have written on here, before, and what has been written by other Jeffersonian scholars, I will post a link (http://www.temple.edu/lawschool/dpost/slavery.PDF) to a particularly good essay on the matter.<br />
<br />
I encourage you to read it.<br />
<br />
Jefferson was not a perfect person...but he strove to do the right things as best as he could within his era.<br />
<br />
A good example of what happens when a person takes a non-pragmatic and non-political approach to attempting to change society for the better can be seen in the life of Thomas Paine.  He was one of the finest men of that era with many beliefs ahead of his time...and he ended up so slandered and reviled that it was near a century after his death before non-libellous histories of his life were researched and published.  To this day, of the Founders, he is one of the least remembered.  Much of his problems and troubles were directly related to his refusal to temper his beliefs or willingness to allow for a slower evolution of societal norms rather than ill-fated social revolution.</div></div><hr />

He certainly wasn't the last politician to say one thing in public and do the exact opposite in private.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the essay keeps referring to the Declaration of Independence as though it mandated equality for all, whereas its plain text says the opposite.<br />
<br />
Maybe the author should actually read the whole thing, before writing about it.To this day, of the Founders, he is one of the least remembered.  Much of his problems and troubles were directly related to his refusal to temper his beliefs or willingness to allow for a slower evolution of societal norms rather than ill-fated social revolution.No one would have faulted Jefferson if he didn't rape his slave(s) (we only know of one for sure).</div></div><hr />

Madoff started in 1978 or something like that.  It is unfair to blame this disaster on the Reps.  The SEC does have blame.  The lacked the common sense to relealize that everything did not add up.

Started what?  His corrupt fund?  Or his career?<br />
<br />
My point was he was investigated by the SEC based on complaints that he was running a Ponzi scheme, and this was within the last year or so.  They did such a lax job on the investigation they didn't find anything.  How can you NOT find a fookin' Ponzi scheme?  Well, apparently they just asked a few questions and accepted the answers they got back without digging or questioning their sources.  He's rich and making lots of money so he can't be wrong.<br />
<br />
It's the same attitude they (the Bush administration) used when some people started to investigate AIG.  They were too highly leveraged and many people knew this.  Elliot Spitzer started investigating it and the Bushies sued the AG's that were investigating AIG to get them to stop the investigation.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the current investigation into the SEC will reveal how this sort of negligence can occur.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NEW YORK (CNN) -- A whistleblower who repeatedly warned the Securities and Exchange Commission that Bernard Madoff was perpetrating a massive investment fraud testified Wednesday that the regulatory agency that oversees financial markets is inept, &quot;financially illiterate&quot; and far too cozy with the financial titans it is supposed to be regulating.<br />
<br />
&quot;The SEC is also captive to the industry it regulates and it is afraid of bringing big cases against the largest most powerful firms,&quot; said Harry Markopolos, an independent financial fraud investigator. &quot;Cleary the SEC was afraid of Mr. Madoff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Markopolos began contacting the SEC at the beginning of the decade to warn that Madoff was a fraud. He sent detailed memos, listing dozens of red flags, laying out a road map of instructions for SEC investigators to follow, even listing contacts and phone numbers of Wall Street experts whom he said would confirm his findings. But, Markopolos' whistle-blowing effort got nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gift wrapped and delivered the largest Ponzi scheme in history to them and some how they couldn't be bothered to conduct a thorough and proper investigation because they were too busy on matters of higher priority,&quot; Markopolos told the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we can put the smarter theory to rest now (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/business/06madoff.html?ref=business).<br />
There was a time &#8212; was it only two months ago? &#8212; when people would have been proud to be on a list of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s customers. They had made the cut, and their money was getting the Madoff touch, growing steadily and solidly in good times and bad.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also on the list are the estate of the singer and composer John Denver.<br />
Paul Howell/Getty Images<br />
<br />
Ira Lee Sorkin, who is Mr. Madoff&#8217;s lawyer, is also on the list.<br />
<br />
There they would be, among boldfaced names from the real estate world, the sports community, the arts and the corner offices of American business.<br />
<br />
Today that list is an exhibit in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, part of the paperwork documenting the annihilation of Mr. Madoff&#8217;s magic and his customers&#8217; money. The boldfaced names have become red-faced, angry and perhaps embarrassed to find themselves caught in what prosecutors say is by far the largest Ponzi scheme in modern history.<br />
