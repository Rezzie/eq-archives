PALIN: Says she made frugality a point when traveling on state business as Alaska governor, asking &quot;only&quot; for reasonably priced rooms and not &quot;often&quot; going for the &quot;high-end, robe-and-slippers&quot; hotels.<br />
<br />
THE FACTS: Although travel records indicate she usually opted for less-pricey hotels while governor, Palin and daughter Bristol stayed five days and four nights at the $707.29-per-night Essex House luxury hotel (robes and slippers come standard) overlooking New York City's Central Park for a five-hour women's leadership conference in October 2007. With air fare, the cost to Alaska was well over $3,000. Event organizers said Palin asked if she could bring her daughter. The governor billed her state more than $20,000 for her children's travel, including to events where they had not been invited, and in some cases later amended expense reports to specify that they had been on official business.<br />

Those who recognize Palin as a joke, and just don't care anymore (luckily we're the majority).<br />
<br />
And those Christian nutjobs who see Palin as the new savior, and will believe anything she says.<br />
<br />
Either way, the fact that every other sentence of hers is a lie, is irrelevant, just as she is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sarah Palin said she thinks the Republican ticket lost the 2008 presidential election because Americans were looking for change, and not because she undermined the campaign or was unprepared for the vice presidential seat. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I could be blamed for losing the race any more than I could be credited with winning the race had I done a better job as a candidate,&quot; Palin added.So says the vice presidential candidate with probably the highest unfavorable rating in history -- I think it was over 50% during the campaign.  Her unfavorable ratings are still over 50%.Palin said it's &quot;a bit heartbreaking&quot; to see Levi Johnston, the father of her grandson, taking the road he has chosen. Palin said Johnston, who is set to appear in an upcoming edition of Playgirl magazine, is appearing in &quot;****,&quot; and on a path that is &quot;not a healthy place to be.&quot;Eh.  I bet her favorability ratings would jump if she followed his example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reviewing books and holding public figures accountable is at the core of good journalism, but the Associated Press' treatment of Palin's book seems an unprecedented move at the wire service.That's right, the conservative complaint is that the Associated Press was simply too thorough in their reporting.<br />
<br />
They should have assigned only one reporter, who would have only caught maybe half the lies.<br />
<br />
And the &quot;Republicans&quot; wonder why no one wants to vote for the Party of No anymore.</div></div><hr />

Vicious truths!<br />
It is her mastery of the lament that explained former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&#8217;s appeal last year, and now her knack for self-pity is on full display in her book, &#8220;Going Rogue.&#8221; This is the memoir as prolonged, keening wail, larded with petty vindictiveness. With an impressive attention to detail, Ms. Palin settles every score, answers every criticism; locates a scapegoat for every foul-up, and fastens an insult on every critic, down to the last obscure Palin-doubter back in Alaska.</div></div><hr />
