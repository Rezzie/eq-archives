But I hear you.. endgame mages have INSANE times 10 damage. 3,4 crits seems like all day things theese days. :(<br />

I usually beat them.. but sometimes they get a monstercrit and you health goes &quot;poof&quot;. :( :(</div></div><hr />

Have you had much success cat-ing them?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of cat-ing cloth wearers with the new improved catform.. but im guess 'm stuck with old-patch habits. :p</div></div><hr />

Anyone on Gorefiend?  I would appreciate a pack of druids running down and tearing his ass to pieces.  Our friend justin has a ****ty level 60 rogue but he's slow as hell so we can get away without a wipe, even maybe corpse-gaurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">09-23-2005, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bear Form owns Mages.  Trust me, it does.  Catform does too, but against human mages hardly, but then again if you are horde, your chances of ambushing a human mage are much higher.  Dueling a human mage as a Druid/Rogue is pointless, they know you are coming and use their racial to find you, if they are Gnome then they just AoE.  <br />
<br />
But, yeah, Bear Form definately has what it takes to topple mages.  The trick is to get their timing down, don't use Bash to heal UNTIL they have used their Blink (otherwise they blink out of it).  If/When they do Blink, use Feral Charge to get right back into their face.  Not only do you need not worry about counter spell, but at the same time you aren't given them chance to use it when you do heal.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, catform still works best against Mages, but Bear Form is just as good, it just doesn't kill them as fast as Catform does, but it does give you an alternate play style against Mages.</div></div><hr />

Heal early and often<br />
Use Feral Charge (Bear) to close the distance when they blink<br />
Use Warstomp / Bash as necessary<br />
Moonfire when shifting out to heal<br />
<br />
Long story short - even Feral Specd (but not Feral geared), your healing mana pool should well outlast their damage mana pool</div></div><hr />

<br />
a guildie of mine was quite bored one day (gnome mage), and so he trained a mob with level 1 frostbolts from searing gorge/burning steppes? (the one above redridge) all the way to the inn in lakeshire, and then iceblocked.  i'm not sure if this was a bug or how it is supposed to function, but iceblock cleared aggro off him, but the mob did not retreat, it instead began to kill everyone in the inn :D.  it was the funniest WoW moment in recent memory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rolled on Gorefiend too. I met one of your Red Shirts breifly yesterday. A Master Sargent something. Dwarf Paladin I think. He had the coolest gear. Looked like he was carying about 15 weapons all sticking out of his back.<br />
<br />
Speaking of training. Last night someone took a bunch of mobs from Darkshore to the Aberdine inn. Not only cleared aggro, but turned them green, as in an NPC. I could not attack etc. There were about 10 of them. So I decided to ignore them and started a trade with a food/drink vendor. All of a sudden they all aggroed me. The guards came running, but it was too late. 10 Mobs on my puny level 11 didn't leave much time for a heal. It was hilarious. New PvP only talent, &quot;Disguise&quot; wipes aggro list, and temporarily turns them into an NPC. Lasts until everyone stops paying attention and you can 1HK the nearest low level player. FUN FUN.<br />

<br />
as for the horde being outnumbered on gorefiend, the horde always say they are outnumbered, but i doubt you can recall a time when you were zerged by alliance without having backup to call in.  i can recall just as many times that the horde were zerging bb, ss, wpl, epl, and ws as when the alliance were.</div></div><hr />
