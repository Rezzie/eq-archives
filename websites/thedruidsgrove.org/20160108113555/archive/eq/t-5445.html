<br />
This is directed to ZONES given in the next expansion. <br />
<br />
This can be Instanced or Not on these options im more interested int he subject rather than if its instanced or not.<br />

<br />
There was a consistent storyline, and even though the ending was anticlimactic people were still eagerly waiting to see how it was going to play out. I was personally in favor of the turn in spells and the flags. The flags were buggy, and it caused a bit of headache where backflagging was concerned, but overall it was a great implementation on a step up system.</div></div><hr />

Unlike LOY or LDON  POP is one of the expansions that people never get bored of. ( imo anyways) There are so much contents and stuff. Makes it a expansion worth for the cost imo. Luclin, Velious, Kunark are  also nice.</div></div><hr />

It's nice that we are the only guild on my server in Time... we have had fun with it and stayed mostly a step ahead of all the other guilds getting there so we didn't have a lot of contested fights.  But the LDoN raids are so bad that most of my guild is headed to FFXI now.  I still like EQ and would like to be able to do something raidwise that is more than farming Time.  <br />
<br />
The nice thing about PoP expansion was that the encounters were so different from one another.  I remember in SoL there was always a reference to another mob.. &quot;we are gonna do this just like we did XX&quot; and we would win.  Almost too predictable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kileren</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see some zones included for small groups (1 to 3 players) which happen to be high level , non-uber. I am closing in on level 65, with only Umbral and bazaar/market equipment. I'm okay with this and I do pretty good. My very small guild is the same way. We do not need a whole zone or expansion targeted toward us; we would just like some consideration and some viable places for us to venture out and have some fun and success. PoP has some areas, Luclin and Kunark did. Velious less so, at least for us.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Problem with the 300 closed zones in GOD in that you couldnt do much with them outside raids (and i dont wanna hear someone bitch about their &quot;l33t&quot; qvic xp groups because the xp sucks.)  PoP zones also had more charactert to them.  OoW is pretty good with them, but theres still some &quot;GOD Styling&quot; errors - ie DS RCoD BF all looking the same, all the instances looking the same, and all the zones but rifts having the same mobs. Though in OoW im overall impressed with the zone design itself -- but theres still not PoP type distinction.<br />
 <br />
Expansion requests / Rating for post LDoN expansions;<br />
 <br />
*Zone Distinction (7 OoW, 1 GoD)<br />
*Unique and fun raid events (10 OoW, 9 GoD)<br />
*Unique mobs to each zone (3 OoW, -1000 GoD)<br />
*&quot;Private&quot; non-instanced XP areas for elitists (1 OoW, 3 GoD)<br />
--Most pubbies on my server aren't 69+ so rifts counts as of now.<br />
*One groupable aug camps (10 OoW, 7 GoD)<br />
*Easy accesibility outside of ports (2 OoW, 3 GoD)<br />
--GoD rating retroed to 4 because of qvic TL`er, but since it came after OoW went live it doesn't count<br />
*Raid mobs with different models than XP mobs (WTF that's posible?!)<br />
 <br />
To end this how I started:<br />
Closed and keyed zones give you more of a reason to put time into the expansion.  I would love if you would need a flag from Hulcror or something along that lines to get into MPG, but the truth is while I'm raiding the big **** some pubbie is on boards bitching about they never saw VT or PoTime -- so they have the bigger voice.  PoP is the most underrated expansion imo -- people always talk about how good Velious was, but from what I assume that's only because they were new to raiding, and Velious was the first expansion to introduce well designed raid events and did it MUCH better then Luclin, but no expansion ever was more well designed or ahead of time than PoP.  The idea of having to work through multiple raid events with your guild to go to zones you've only heard of to get to xp in the best camps, camp the best names, and raid the best mobs (ok in elems that's debatable ;p) was a great one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MariuzDevereux</div><div class="date">01-07-2006, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put PoP.... how old is the expansion? At least 5 expansions?  Yet there are STILL guilds that are slugging through the planes... why?  cuz it was a blast!  Nowadays you can easily join a Time+ guild, so i have great respect for guilds who are still going through PoP today.  It made Ebay'ing SO much harder since most of the time the newbie ebay'er has no clue how to check what flags they had cuz they didnt know where to look :P  Plus, there was something back in the day, raiding Rallos Zek over and over again, til you FINALLY beat his a$$ in the pit.... and the HUGE reward: Sol Ro Acess + Part of Elemental acess = $$$.  I don't think i've felt as proud of an acomplishment in EQ as when i was raiding in PoP.  It had great raid areas, and great exp areas.... only thing that sucked about PoP was the flagging situation.... <br />
 <br />
SoE needs to just go to a guild-flagging or account flagging code.  If they made guild-flagging, it would prevent using guilds just to get flags to get into another guild, help prevent loot-scooters, and create less problems for the guild since backflagging wont be an issue.  An alternative would be account flagging.  I know i HATED having to go back and get my cleric and ranger all those PoP flags so i could bring them with me...Only problem i see with that is preventing lowbies from entering a zone they shouldnt be in (adding minimum level requirements could easily fix that though.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stratofortress</div><div class="date">01-08-2006, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP was an awesome expansion. Would love to see a PoP 2 like expansion - lots of gods of lore are out there without the need to bring aliens and alphabet soup mobs to Norrath. The drive to beat RZtW was so unreal, everyone was so fired up and pumped - I miss that. The closed zones needing progression actually made sense and was a big motivator. <br />
<br />
GoD, altough not that bad for some other reasons, sucked on progression understanding and motivation.<br />
<br />
I also like the idea of revamping Old World zones.<br />
<br />
And no more scripts that put such a heavy chance factor in it like OMM please.</div></div><hr />
