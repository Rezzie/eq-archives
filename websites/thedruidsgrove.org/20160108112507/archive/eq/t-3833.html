The changes to a lot of zones like Halas, etc. were intentional back when they went in. :(</div></div><hr />

Actually they stealth fixed that last patch.  I think this is just a late announcement of that change.</div></div><hr />

They probably weren’t going to mention it in a patch, but I hope they were aware of it. I know I saw a few people in various zones complaining about it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenmarel</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if anyone cares Wolf Form is still KoS in FV.  I learnt this after I conned a guard was attacked by a drixie and trained it and a couple pilgrims till I could evac.  So it looks like Sony's attention to detail in creating a realistic fantasy world is still unproven.  Personally I think Cazic-Thule has tainted their water.  It's the little things like this that disappoint me the most<br />
<br />
.  Wolf Form is one of the main reasons I chose the Druid class.  It’s about time they gave us Druids a permanent illusion aaxp too.  Since Enchanters having this for Wolf Form is a slap in our face beyond the fact they got a speed adjustment with it in the first place.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I always thought being KoS is pretty believable because when a Barbarian sees a wolf the first thing he thinks is, “Hey that would make a nice Hat.”</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tils</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually I can see the logic of wolf form being kos in some places. I mean some people in RL are scared of wolves.<br />
<br />
What I fail to understand is why bears arnt kos anywhere. I know id be scared out of my mind if i met some grizzly bear in my down face to face...<br />
<br />
or even a litch..<br />
<br />
or even an imp...<br />
<br />
or even a walking skeleton..<br />
<br />
You know keep it consistant which is all i ask :P<br />

All brilliant engineers - who had no clue how to build a bonfire. Ended up tossing 2 gallons of petrol via a pint glass on it to get it started.<br />
<br />
Many, MANY fireworks and mucho booze. I haven't had a hangover like that in years.<br />
<br />
The fun part was when folks starting putting &quot;dud&quot; fireworks in the bonfire - they went interesting places before they blew up.</div></div><hr />
