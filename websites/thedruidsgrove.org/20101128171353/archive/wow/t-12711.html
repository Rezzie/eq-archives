<br />
&quot;There is a plan to give player access to two talent specs to switch between them without having to respec all the time. More details in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this kill Feral's as off-tanks?  Does this mean that every warrior can prot and PvP spec?  Does this mean I'll need to carry more gear for my Feral/Moonkin dual spec?</div></div><hr />

The WOTLK talent trees I have seen show the feral tree getting a lot of new talents, and once-again a splintering in the tree between bear and cat. Ferals will have to choose between DPS or tanking specs.</div></div><hr />

My concern was more about warriors and priests that will now have dual specs.  How many warriors do you know that no longer tank because it got boring and they couldn't do anything else?  Same for priest?  Now they can be shadow spec by day, holy by night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on a slightly more serious note Blizz do seem to be working their hardest to flatten out what diversity there is between the classes and I'm not sure that being able to spec totally down two different Talent trees is necessarily a step forward although for hybrid classes it might be more useful to be able to bring a decent healer and tank in one to a raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">07-01-2008, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will be interesting to see the eventual fallout. My guess is the primary thrust of this move is to help out classes that are so one dimentional that they can do little else than what their primary spec allows them to do (eg prot warriors and prot pallies) and with pve vs pvp specs, etc. My guess is they will introduce some sort of artificial limiter on the ability to switch specs. For example you have to go do an old world class trainer. In a 25 man raid you would probably have at least 1 lock so getting them back to the raid wouldn't be overly hard, that isn't guaranteed in a 10 man.<br />
 <br />
Another thing they might be trying to address is to help people get groups again for those classes you mention (war/priest). All things being equal if I already have a healer and I am not going to look for another one, same with tank. At the end of the day though I wonder if this doesn't introduce a level of complexity to the LFG senario that will just confuse people.</div></div><hr />

According to the site, Blizzard hasn't told them to stop with the talent/skill leaks.  They just don't want them leaking screen shots (who cares about screen shots??).  So, I suspect talent trees are somewhat valid (to date).  Though I did notice a complete lack of new skills for bear (though Maul now gets the mangle buff as well as shred).<br />
<br />
It does look like you can have a valid PvE kitty/bear build.  Though you might have to drop intensity (sort of sucks) to make it happen.  They added one more kitty only talent (Primal Precision -- seems a bit weak to me), otherwise most of the Feral talents buff both Kitty and bear in some form.  It also means you might not be able to take Nurturing Instinct either, but if they do allow dual specs this might not be much of an issue for those of us that like to Feral heal from time-to-time.</div></div><hr />
