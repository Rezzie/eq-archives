Not one monk/beastlord/druid wanted them. The guild was shocked, no one<br />
wanted them. Sure they had about 50-60 hp/mana more then qvic/epic 2.0 chest boots but they just lacked. No focus, no mana regen, the effects dot shielding, etc etc were low and useless. What were the designers thinking of when they made them, god. Hopefully someone will look into tacvi leather itemization and fix them.</div></div><hr />

Most other slots did get a focus in traditional 'mold' slots, and wrist gets a focus when they normally don't.</div></div><hr />

While they raised the number of loots dropped per mob they added in armor sets - and as you can tell from the looks of it, they were through of very hastefully.  Before the reitemization the only gear for 'armor-mold' slots were the bracers from XXXreic, pre-tunat that is (rumor has it that they lost tunat's loot table before he was beatened and quickly had to think up a new one)</div></div><hr />

Some of our druids are FT starved. <br />
I was hovering at 21 until I got my epic. Several times of late I have dropped below 20 and had to resort to tribute. This has caused me to pass on the Sandals of Constant change twice. The Anguish aug is what saved me.<br />
<br />
Maybe I just have had bad luck on my gear choices.</div></div><hr />

I think every item should have FT on it. :)<br />
<br />
That said, DoN merchants sell FT3 augs for a very reasonable crystal cost.  <br />
<br />
Of course, removing the aug is a few thousand platinum but then again, GoD murimite armor is a ridiculous 10.5k per piece to an NPC (who we know really needs the cash:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's just one problem here.<br />
If I have to give up my HP and MANA augs to have the FT, I might as well go back to my PoTime gear with the FT on it and stay with the HP/MANA augs.<br />
<br />
I have HP, Mana or both in every single aug slot but my waist and I have spell shield aug there I don't want to give up.<br />
<br />
With Endgame gear, I don't think I should have to give up augment slots for FT</div></div><hr />

And imp dodge 3 on arms, more of a mnk/bst effect, and no helm slot.  Guess what my first post was saying is I doubt they will go back 3 expansions and modify gear.  Like Kamion said they already went through Tacvi's loot table I think it was like 8 months ago and items got a fairly large boost then.  I do remember having a tough time keeping up to FT cap in Qvic+ gear, but Anguish and DoN totally blew FT up.  Anguish quest slots add up to FT25 alone without any other gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point on this one Kaidman, however, at 1 piece per boss ( at least I've never seen em drop 2 yet ), 5 day lockouts and 60 people clawing for armor, it's quite slow going.</div></div><hr />

One of the best geared casters in my guild pre-OOW only had FT 13, but the content outside of that definaly has a lot of options to raise your FT with.  With that being said, I don't think its a current issue that needs to be addressed, because any guild that's capable of killing zun / tacvi mobs is capable of killing high end OOW / DoN content where FT is more abundant.</div></div><hr />

This stuff all seems better geared to monks and beastlords than it does for druids.  Not to mention one of our best heal focuses comes on qvic arms making any upgrade to that slot very difficult in the first place, but block 3 or dodge 3 is laughable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which does..... absolutely NOTHING. 12% alt focus translates to about 7 mana saved on each heal. Wow... a whole 7 mana. It's not 7% mana, it's 7 mana. 7 mana you can regen fast anyway.<br />
<br />
I would take CoA helm in a heartbeat because of the hp/mana, don't get me wrong. But IMO if you have an mpg trial helm, it's not worth getting a CoA helm to upgrade unless you get it very cheap dkp wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kzar</div><div class="date">06-20-2005, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">backtrack,<br />
The boots have no focus, thats what really makes them suck.<br />
<br />
But the ft comment, they left the ft on the plate boots, but removed/didn't add them to the leather. So we are left with +hp/mana -focus -ft on them, hence they rotted. Even the beasts with qvic boots passed on these, because they much perfered the qvic to the tacvi. Kinda sad when endzone loot rots in favor of 1 groupable stuff in the same expansion.</div></div><hr />
