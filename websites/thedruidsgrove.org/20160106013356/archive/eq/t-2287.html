<br />
I don't mean to be a bother, but I am currently having a difficult time deciding how to proceed with my druid. Here is my situation:<br />
<br />
* Guildless<br />
<br />
* Only able to spend a few hours at a time online<br />
<br />
* Primarily a soloer due to limited time<br />
<br />
* Basic gear - only what I can afford via the bazaar using a few hundred pp at a time.<br />
<br />
* 56K dial-up connection<br />
<br />
Here is my question: Where can someone in this situation hunt safely for the short time they are on? <br />
<br />
I am currently quadding spirocs in TD whenever I can but due to my poor connection I fairly often get some pretty bad lag there that causes rather messy deaths. Also, though the spirocs do drop a few pp and some basic items, I have to kill a ton of them to really get any kind of money saved.<br />
<br />
My ideal place to hunt would be some place where I can log on, find some decent xp blues to root and rot, have a chance at some kind of nice drop and then log off awaiting the chance to do it again later. Do any places like this exist? I'm willing to go through hazardous areas to get to a spot if the destination, again, is somewhat safe.<br />
<br />
Is this a pipedream or do I have a chance at making a change. Any help is very much appreciated in advance!!!<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />

I personally have a good connection, so I'm not sure which zones are bad with a low connection, but I would guess bazaar has got to be Heck.  There are many mobs that drop better loot than those birds, but most are camped and green.  You can root/rot the seafury cyclops in OOT with the chance of an occasional gem drop.  If you don't feel safe quadding, you can root/rot the wyverns in Cobalt.  There are some gold mines like crystal caverns that if you can grab the camp for the geonids (almost always camped), you can rake up some pretty good pp in a short time by just rotting one at a time.<br />
<br />
Almost every zone has a place where you can sit and root/rot for a rare drop.  Just look at Allakazam's site to find some drops that are within your level that have a good sell value.  Or try some quests for items you want... some of them actually yeild nice items.<br />

<br />
1.) Go to Ssra Temple. Find the West and South walls. Kill both of the Golems standing at them.<br />
<br />
2.) Cast snare on &quot;a Shissar Revenant&quot;. They do not assist and are not very resistant to anything. Just root/rot like normal. They drop &quot;A Polished Serpent Scale&quot; which sells for around 9pp to merchants and is stackable. <br />
<br />
I'm sure this would be very nice experience for a level 51 druid but my advice would be not to try this until level 54 when you get Winged Death and Breath of Ro (53). The shissar go down by stacking Breath of Ro, Winged Death, and Drifting Death about two or three times. <br />
<br />
Also you can quad kite these for nice experience and of course loot. I found it best to quad kite them with the level 58 AE of course, as you may run out of mana trying the level 49 AE.<br />
<br />
Another thing, the golems repop on the walls once about every 15 minutes. On occasion you will find named golems such as &quot;A Shattered Golem&quot;. He is just about as strong as the eternal golems and he drops Grey Flesh Gloves which are EXCELLENT for druids. The +6 wis helps tremendously and Affliction Effenciency II increases the length of Drifting Death, putting it at around ~720 damage.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped.</div></div><hr />

I have a simliar situation to you only in addition to only playing a couple hours at a time I frequently need to go afk.  I have found JPF to be an incredibly easy zone to hunt in since very little is aggro to a druid.<br />
<br />
With tracking you never run out of mobs and as long as you avoid killing faction mobs (black panthers, treants) nothing there will aggro you.  Track down timber griffons (which drop a nice secondary item rarely) and root/rot them or aggro charm once you have the magic debuff.<br />
<br />
Loot here will not be great, but a lot of the willowisps are still dark blue to me at 52 and they drop a greater lightstone every time.  You can sell them in the bazaar for 12pp or do the concordance quest in NK for 10pp.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

One additional question I do have is that after posting I also heard about Maiden's Eye and heard that I could root/rot mobs if I stayed on a wall near the zone. Is this accurate? Thanks again.<br />

By lvl 59 I relished big trains so I didn't have to pull as many mobs for my pet ;) <br />
<br />
I would highly recommend starting by using camo and running to Toiler Hill, roughly 1500, -500 on the map here (http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/maidenseyemap.html)<br />
<br />
You can usually pull Toilers up close to the wall and bake them without too many adds.  You can quad these guys with a decent mana pool and KEI, but adds can get hectic.<br />
<br />
When you hit 54-55, you could start charming with CoK along the West wall.  <br />

<br />
Also, as previously mentioned, add's are constant and hard to escape from.  Root wears off fast, and resist seems to be high.  Tough zone, for sure.  Prolly better places to go then ME.  <br />

Good luck hun<br />

It's kinda slow xp but you get spell drops up to 54 for all classes plus the occasional forest loop (bout once a day drop off verdants from my experience there) and even more rare tree weave.  For pure xp try small raptors in TD. Loot is horrible there though, great place for AA at that level</div></div><hr />

You can get to High Keep by porting to Misty, zoning to RV, then kith, then high pass, then finally high keep.  I went from 51-55 in about 2 weeks.  Just root/dot.  Exp is great and aa exp is even better.</div></div><hr />
