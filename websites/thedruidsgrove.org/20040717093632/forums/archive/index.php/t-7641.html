PoP, original, kunark, velious, and SoL but when i go to hit the patch this damn a required .DLL file, D3D8.DLL, was not found. i have removed everquest and all of its components a few times and it still comes up.

<br />
- Make sure you install all the CD's in Order (original/kunark/velious/luclin/pop), with no patching in between.<br />
- Then patch those (with no extras checked in the Advanced page of patcher).<br />
- Then check off LoY, close and re-patch.<br />
- Then check off LDoN, close, and re-patch.<br />
- Then check off GoD, close and re-patch.<br />
<br />
I also re-booted between each CD and each patch.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />

It only took 129Minutes to patch, I had re-loaded EQ about a month earlier, patching each disk as I went, I would estimate the total time spent to be close to 300 Minutes.<br />
Go Figure?</div></div><hr />

Now I'm really glad I have cable.  I got a new PC and reload EQ - only took about 5 minutes for the patches to download.  You have my sympathy.</div></div><hr />
