We are considered as &quot;wild&quot; people. In a roleplay view, we live in trees and worship the nature more than we worship Tunare herself thus we get our powers out of the nature not from Tunare herself which makes us some kind of shamans (opposed to clerics who get their power directly from their god).</div></div><hr />

(The other one was from a bard, but they're supposed to be smooth and suave. =P) Can you imagine a female wood elven cleric though?  Sheesh she'd never be left alone!

<br />
I'd say (from an RP viewpoint), wood elves can't be clerics because their society isn't structured enough.  They don't really have churches (or whatever), because they don't worship nature, they're in tune with it and live with it... hence druids instead.<br />
<br />
Or something like that. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tunare is the creator of the elven race, so that is why most elves, particulary Wood Elf druids and rangers and High Elf clerics and paladins, worship her.  She is the source of nature (have you visited the Plane of Growth recently?) and that is why elves have such a strong affinity for it.  Most everyone associates we tree dwelling Wood Elves with nature but if you visit Felwithe you'll observe that many of the High Elf NPC's have nature oriented last names, too.<br />
<br />
If you study the historical druids, who were the priests of the Celtic people, you'll learn that they worshipped the god and goddess (I can't recall their names at the moment), not nature, although their god and goddess were closely associated with nature.  The Celts were an agrarian society (i.e., farmers), and their holidays were based on natural phenomena such as the solstices, etc.<br />
<br />
Clerics, druids, and shamans are the priests of their various cultures.  It does seem a bit redundant that halflings and humans would have both (particularly the halflings since both the clerics and druids reside in the same city, at least the human druids reside in Surefall Glade away from the hustle and bustle of Qeynos) but EQ is afterall just a game. :b</div></div><hr />

After all while druids can heal we are not primarily healers like a cleric is. Halflings can become druids or clerics in my opinion because that is the general personality of a halfling, to be close to nature or to enjoy helping people, both of which are good qualifications for becoming a druid or cleric. Besides lol we only get to choose 4 classes as it is dont begrudge us an extra class. One final reason that we can be either clerics or druids is simple, we are so darn cute that Verant couldnt resist giving us an extra class lol.<br />
