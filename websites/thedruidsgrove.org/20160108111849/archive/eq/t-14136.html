<br />
     Can anyone help supply a little info on the raid?  Or at least what the third of the initial group mm is?<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the MM is called Zebuxorak's Pact and is offered in TT.  The party becomes a necro (the healer) and up to 5 SK.  The mission involves killing 50 mobs in an instance version of kaesora then fighting VS.  The common loot drop for this mission is a very nice aug with hp and mana.  Not terribly hard and well worth farming...it seems to take a bit over an hour to do.<br />
<br />
The second MM is called One Shall Rule Them All and is offered in EJ.  I havent played this one yet but I understand its an instanced version of FM and involves killing 5 named at or around the giant fort.  The common loot is an aug with ac and mana....probably appeal the most to pally/sk/rangers.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what the third MM is?<br />
<br />

Sliggoth, druid/ tradeskiller of &amp;th hammer</div></div><hr />

use the clue you got when porting up and say to him &quot;i offer you ..., ..., and ...&quot; (i forget the exact words) and you will get the mission.... <br />
 <br />
once inside the mission just keep killing things, there is no death limit. go to the end and do loot in the chests and oncwe you do loot the book and venril sathir will spawn... just keep hurting him and if you die just run back and kamakazi harmtouch, dont worry about the adds he spawns, just get him down<br />
 <br />
once he's down you win<br />
 <br />
 <br />
now for the 24 man MM... to my knowledge this has never been beaten. i have tried this many many many times and have gotten very close. 6 people pick dragons and the rest pick frogloks/sarnaks... the raid divides and the dragons kill a bunch of mobs at where trakanon spawns in sebilis<br />
 <br />
all the others go around killing mobs up top in sebilis... once this looooong part is over, everyone meets up at trakanon's spawn spot to deal with the council... the council is ****ing HARD, we are still currently working on a strat for them, 2 or 3 come at a time in waves, we keep getting to the last wave and continually wiping due to their incredibly fast speed and hits<br />
 <br />
if you try this raid expect alot of wipes and failures, but learn from them... you must have alot of patience and be willing to raid til 2 in the morning most nights :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
nm, found the answers on sony's forums<br />
need 1 person with all 3 missions beaten to get the 24 man raid, and apparantly Lorekeeper Blaimas in pok will direct you to the task givers for each mission.<br />
<br />
now if anyone knows what the drops are like from this raid...would be interesting to know if its worth trying to do it.</div></div><hr />
