PvP trinket does no good since it's once every 5 mins, and can't be used in feral (ie for most of the PvP time).</div></div><hr />

I think the blacksmithing trinket is a certain duration of fear immunity though, which is even better.</div></div><hr />

However, you can't use it to remove an already active fear effect, so...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrax</div><div class="date">05-14-2005, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes but a priest casts fear at most once every 26 seconds and a Warlock's fear is now on the same diminishing returns timer as Seduce so that helps as well.  Overall, if you get feared in caster form, you can use the pvp trinket to break it.  If you are fighting a warlock, you have 1.5 seconds to hit your blacksmithing trinket when you see him start to cast.  Generally, people want to fear your caster form as that is when it hurts the most, but the drawback to that is when you are in your caster form, you can use the trinkets.</div></div><hr />
