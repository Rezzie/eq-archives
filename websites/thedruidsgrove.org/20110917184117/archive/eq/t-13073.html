<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">09-27-2007, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked Hierophant because I'm class leader also. But my play style is versatile, as is our class :) I solo, I group and raid. I'm a Wanderer, when ever I have time I port all around the realm. My druid loves all creatures of the nature, but she HATES trees! Those are just evil. I think it's because of her childhood, she lived in Kelethin and fell off of those platforms and elevators too many times :(</div></div><hr />

Otherwise I spose Wanderer is the closest to what I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">10-22-2007, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a wanderer, although dangerously close to being a defiler druid! Oh the amount of temples of dragons, snakes, lizards, defying even the gods themselves! Oh the amount of genocide I have reaped upon poor harmless giants, their other buddies in kael, various bits of undead (those poor disturbed elysians I was only trying to help), denizens of the planes, denizens from other dimensions bent upon the conquering of Norrath(I was just making friends and being friendly!) even going so far as to take them on in Kuua, frogs and frogloks, goblins, orcs and well anything really that might have dropped something neat, or just because!<br />
<br />
But, alas my saving grace, was the interest of explorations. Figuring out specific zones and areas, in search of rare artifacts in the bowels of someplace no one rarely visited more than once(Riwwi, dragons necropolis, akeheva, nadox, etc), armed to the teeth with all my good little supply of about 5-10 different weapons(journey stick, lumi staff,naturewalkers scimmy, hiero crook, various proc weapons, fun effect clickies, phylactry, regen bps, clicky snares and roots, clicky dots, etc!) and tools and instruments of my archaelogy techniques(elder beads, identify mask, pumice stones, etc)!</div></div><hr />
