I played EQ for about 2 years and got kethdredd up to 55 on Xegony before I quit.  It was a no brainer that I pick up a druid in WOW.  I haven't even tried another class  yet.  To me WOW made the druid class what I hoped it was going to be in EQ.  It's not perfect but I sure enjoy meleeing a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was a druid in EverQuest, can't remember my exact level (it was in the 30's) since it was so long ago I played that.<br />
<br />
I also was a druid in DAOC for the duration of my free month =)  Didn't enjoy the 100% pvp focus of that game.<br />
<br />
I was a druid in NWN, BG/BG2, and had druids in my IWD/IWD2 parties ...but these games don't really count I guess ('cause they're not online).<br />
<br />
Now I'm a level 17 druid in Wow... just got my angry-looking sea lion form! =)<br />
<br />
<br />
...I guess you could say I'm obsessed with druids (or just 'nature characters')<br />

<br />
BUT, I am really enjoying being able to melee, and survive the fight!  I'm still debating if I will be taking this character all the way to 60.  It really depends on if the fun continues or stops.  I'm also having fun playing a shaman and a warrior (lvl 15 and 19 respectively, still babies!) so I guess we'll see which chars continue to grow and which ones don't.<br />
<br />
Its pretty fun being the warrior, and not having to worry about keeping people healed. :)  <br />

In WoW: I go back and forth between a gnome warrior (stop laughing :) ) and an NE druid. Both are 21 at the moment.<br />

If my druid wasn't able to melee, I'd probably have zero interest in the class. I never got a druid past 14 in EQ. :)</div></div><hr />

As different in concept and lore the two classes are, the two things they have in common that makes them enjoyable was their versatility, and more importantly, their survivability.  Both classes are extremely self-sufficient.</div></div><hr />

I originally planned to play an Undead Warrior (With hopes that Undead Warriors would be able to obtain the Death Knight hero class), but a funny thing happened on the way... all my friends, who had been happily playing Horde while I was still scraping together the money to buy a computer capable of playing WoW, switched over to Alliance. So, after researching the classes and races for a while, I noticed... hey, the Druid looks pretty cool, has that hybrid feel going for it, lots of fun little quirks, let's try it out.<br />

Started playing a shaman in WoW and got him to 28; but dammit, they made them too powerful... I hate playing the power-class.  It's like playing a pally, it's just so damn easy it feels like I'm cheating (read: EQ beastlord).  So I switched to an alliance warrior (the complete opposite of the shaman in power), and he's a lot of fun, and I've recently started this druid alt, who is quickly becoming my favorite character.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fawnae</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be truthfully honest... I kinda had a thing against EQ druids.  It was nothing against the class itself... but rather the types of people the class tended to attract.  I was KSd, griefed, told to &quot;stfu n00b&quot;, whatever... by more druids than any other class.  They had all the right tools to do it --- sow, tracking, camoflouge, could dish out some serious damage with DoTs and crit nukes...  Being able to port.  There was even a server-reknowned dr00d who did *nothing* but farm nameds on the server and his tactics were notorious for completely stomping all over anyone who was engaged or possibly going for the mob.  As usual, EQ GMs wouldn't do crap about him, and he did this for well over 2 years... just KSing, training, griefing people.  You would never see another name slandered so much in the /buysell channel... was almost a weekly thing you'd see big flame-wars going on in the trade channel bashing him.  Having been KSd by him 2-3 times, he was damned good at what he did... and he was hated by everyone on the server.<br />
<br />
I knew a lot of good druids, but I also had a ton of run-ins with some jack-ass dr00ds who were just kids and/or immature adults acting like complete idiots.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, that tends not to be the case in WoW.  I've met a lot of nice druids.  So far it seems in WoW the rogue class has taken that moniker of &quot;l33t d00d KSing griefer.&quot;  I've had so many rogues come up to a mob that I was killing and just start wailing on it... then when it died and I couldn't loot the mob and didn't get any xp, I'd see the rogue looting it and then &quot;haha u suck&quot; at me then run off.  If I try to say &quot;dude, that wasn't cool&quot; a typical response that I get is &quot;stfu n00b.&quot;  So that tells me prob the same jackasses who griefed me as druids in EQ are probly playing the rogue class in WoW.  :D<br />
<br />
Again, that doesn't go for all EQ druids and all WoW rogues... it's just been kinda a common theme amongst a few of the rogues I've ran into in WoW.  I prob have 1 incident every few nights where some noobie rogue runs up and KSs me while I'm fighting a mob.</div></div><hr />

My next character was a wizard.. loved him... got him to around 20ish... and got bored dying all the damn time...<br />
<br />
The next was the one that surprised even me!  I wanted to get groups... I wanted to be useful... so I started one of the holy trinity... an Enchanter, Mezzum.<br />
<br />
I loved playing an enchanter.  I died alot but I had fun doing it!  I played him to 67 thru PoP &amp; about a quarter of the way thru Gates, then moved on to EQ2.  Which was boring... grinding = tehsux<br />
<br />
All my RL friends had moved on to WoW by then, so I followed suit.  I started a druid and haven't looked back.  I don't like being main healer, but I can if I want to.  I don't like being main tank, but I can if I am needed to.  I love the versaility that the druid class brings.  Jack of all trades, master of none.

I've realized that most people play this game although I am knew myself have came straight from non-MMo type  games and moan and cry about things that do not realize how well this game was made compared to other MMo's. Yes I have already noticed, they need to work on the servers, concerning lag, bugs, disconnects, etc, but truely this is a well made game. <br />
<br />
On another note, most people do not realize this is a fairly easy mmo, all classes can solo (efficient or not) unlike most others like everquest when almost all classes need to start grouping at a very low level.  I have found even leveling comes very quickly compared to most other rpg's (online or not) where the higher levels could take weeks apon weeks to complete.  ie, when i first started everquest before Planes of Power, it literally took months to do lv54-60.  the level 54 and 59 was about 3-4hrs per blue bub (4%) of crazy crazy grinding.  It weeded out newbs from serious players since a game like WoW a 12yr old that has never even played Zelda for Nes can get lv60.  I do like how it is layed back and coming from a person who has played mmo's for over 10yrs, and regular rpg's (since the nes days) and like consule rpg's, u can log on an hr, kill a few mobs, do some tradeskills etc and log out, unlike everquest, where even gaining a  hand full of regular xp took over 4hrs just to put a dent in.  If you did log on for an hr, the time you get a group together, find a camp, etc, you'll get like 1% and have to log. <br />
<br />
The reason why I did quit everquest was b/c it was very time consuming, leveling took hrs a day, raiding took even more.  In high game everquest, most cases, a raid was a full night, 7pm to 1am and unless doing plane of time (which was, admittedly behind quite a few expansion) you would get close to 5-6 drops a night, and out of 50 people in a raid, you dont see drops for days even weeks only to still be outdated.  I heard someone complaining that a raid in this game took 3 hrs, i almost pissed my pants laughing, com'mon, it's an mmo, it should take a while if you want to see uber items.  <br />
<br />
I have noticed people complaining about class balances.  coming from everquest, the game was totally out of whack.  rogues were literally double dps of all classes and with alternate advancements, never had an aggro issue.  monks were outdated when bards got the fade ability which made them far superior pullers.  paladins and shadowknights, unless crazy uber, were even horrible tanks xp or raid content.  druids could not heal (almost literally) until level 58, but you still needed a cleric if you wanted a rez, which is funny how people get so mad when they die b/c it is absolutely no big deal in this game unless you wipe during an instance.  <br />
<br />
I hope this post will let you newer people to the mmo world, that in comparison, it is a well made game, yes it has its flaws, but i have been enjoying it a lot and am a proud druid =)<br />

<br />
Started off in EQ as a dark elf shadow knight.  Around the time Luclin came out I rolled up a &quot;throwaway&quot; character named Zarros, a high elf cleric.  You see, I was lagging like mad and didn't want to risk my &quot;uber level 32 shadow knight&quot;....LOL.<br />
<br />
Well Zarros became my main and I got him to 65, and then quit shortly after Gates of Discord came out.  I left EQ before that but had come back for Lost Dungeons of Norrath, but found I was enjoying City of Heroes more.  I came back very briefly to EQ and then quit again, and for good, shortly before Omens of War came out.  I played EQII, but got tired of the grindy nature of its soloing and the lack of 20+ soloable quests.  In EQII I had a necromancer, a sorcerer, a warlock, and a brawler.<br />
<br />
In City of Heroes, my main is Tachyon Trinity, and she's a very &quot;defenderish&quot; blaster.  Complete with leadership and plans to pick up the medicine pool.  I've always had a thing for being versatile I guess, either that or no matter how hard I try I always seem to be the healer or thinking like one...<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying the WoW druid a lot, and the flexibility it offers me in being able to solo or contribute to groups in a multitude of ways.</div></div><hr />

There were no classes.. You just took up the skill that was overpowered at the time and abused it until they nurfed it and beefed up another skill.  You didnt have levels, you just had stats and skill points.  When the game came out you were alloted 1400 skill points and each skill only went up to 100 not including skill buffs from items.  People had uber characters who could do everything and anything in the game so eventually they restricted everyone to 700 skill points.  So if you had anything more than that, you lost half your skills because they deteriorated.  What a circus that game was.  It was addicting tho..  I made the title of Glorious Lord briefly and lost it because of death.  Ahh.. the good old days..<br />
<br />
Ugh.. the more I type the more pops into my head.  Eventually they moved to a system that you could LOCK your skills in so they wouldnt deteriorate due to other skill gains.  Then the economy went up in flames because of internet sales.  My dad, my brother, and I ended up with like 4 castles, over 10 houses, and endless ammounts of gold.  LoL..  Also a couple of rare Nightmare steeds which were black horses that could gank people.  Apparently there was less than like 10 or something on each server.  I could be mistaken about that, but I know that they were rare.  Then they tried to balance the economy by adding in more of the rare objects which people lost TONS of money on while others made hordes because they knew where to farm the rare objects.  Eventually the game became MONOPOLY to see who had the most property and most cash.  Ohh my God the good o'l days..<br />
<br />
OOOooOOoooooOoooo..<br />
<br />
LoL!  More comes to mind..  THEIVES!  I remember I had a Theif with 100 skill which was like impossible to obtain unless you jacked your theiving skills up with macros hidden in a house in the middle of nowhere with your friends account.  My dad and his buddies got so good at stealing from people in town that the GM's literally had to CHANGE the location of where the guards stood because people started to call Origin and complain.  HAHAHA.. VESPER!!!  <br />
<br />
I remember we had this all theives guild which was just a bunch of friends my dad knew through business.  We all had 100 hiding, and 100 stealing and we would group in pairs on a bridge and hide so once your ran thru one person, you would be stuck in between 4 people.  We would then steal as much **** from thier pack as possible and when thhe attacked us, we would gank their ass.  OMG we were ****ing pirates!   Damn the good o'l days..<br />
<br />
Eventually and Im 100% POSITIVE due to our guilds exploits, UO nurfed the theiving system.  Shortly after they split the world into 2 areas.  One was the PvP world and one was the PvE world.  The game only went downhill after that.  At about that time we quit UO.  I see the Samurai worlds on the shelves at best buy and think to myself.. why are they still trying?  I would be interested in a UO 2.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I have just been notified that UO2 fell through because of Quality Assurance reasons.  Heheh.. oh well..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, it was EQ that made me into a dirty hippy.  When I started I wanted to be a rogue or a necromancer, as they are more what I like from an RP perspective, but I like the play of the EQ bard too much.  When I wasn't playing a bard due to burn out or carpel tunnel I'd go with druid because I had learned the value of versitility, and they had healing and damage, the 2 things bards didn't have to speak of.<br />
<br />
So when I bought WoW, I did it again because I wanted to be an undead warlock.  About 6 levels in I started a druid and never looked back.  The class is about as close as you can get to the perfect hybrid, short of giving the EQ bard some straight heals and DD's  :whistle: <br />
<br />
Anyway, moral of the story is the worst part of a class based system is in many cases the playstyle of a class you love may be so bad you have to play a class you don't to enjoy your playtime in a MMO.  I think a lot of people that gripe about the class they love really don't love the class, they love what their class would be if we didn't have game mechanics.  Like it or no you have to be a class you like to play rather then a class you want to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I started with EQ I had a female paladin but didn't play her long.<br />
<br />
Then I created a female warrior (Lenasea) who I played until her high 40's.<br />
<br />
Then I created a female wizard (Cinelene) and when she was in her 50's I created a female druid (Rhiaannon).<br />
<br />
I played Rhiaannon until she was 69 but kept Cinelene as well 'cuz I sure liked the nuking!  Rhiaannon was a very versatile character and I just loved the AoE spells and the buffs I could do on other players.<br />
<br />
EQ2 came out and I created a druid there but didn't really like the look of the game and didn't enjoy playing it as much as EQ.<br />
<br />
Then WoW Beta came out and a few of my friends started playing it and one of them  sent me discs to check the Beta out.  Well, long story short, I was never able to get into the Beta and it soon ended.  But I still was interested so I subscribed to WoW and kept my EQ accounts, just in case.  But it wasn't long before I closed the EQ/EQ2 accounts (it was harder to do away with Cinelene and Rhiaannon than I thought!!)<br />
<br />
In WoW I first created a female NE druid named (guess?) Rhiaannon, who's 60 now.  Then got another account and created a human female warlock (Cinelene), who's 41, a human female mage (Fellice), who's 37, and a dwarf female priest (Nighten), who's 22.  I have created a NE warrior on my alt account but haven't played her past 8...I just wanted to get the name (Lanasea) in case I have time to bring her along.<br />
<br />
Each of the classes I've played, both in EQ/EQ2 and WoW have been fun and diverse.  If I didn't have fun with them I would have to delete them.  My play time is too short to spend it not having a good time!!<br />

Like many of the other bards, I was attracted to the versatility, and the cheetah speed, which I so dearly miss from the bard days. EQ just takes up way to much time, so I came to WoW, and the choice was obvious. Druid.</div></div><hr />

RP Servers all the way! haha. I like the WoW Druid best because of the melee (it makes us THAT much better) :rolleyes: but I am soon leaving WoW for EQ2. (probably not for good tho. haha) :)</div></div><hr />

I liked the druid, I could do just about anything. I loved the Necro. Anything I came agains in the normal course of the game I was more than a match for. I was a big solo fan because of irregular game times. I liked it, but I was just too busy to give them the attention they needed. Played EQ2 for a while after it came out, every month it got more and more boring. If it wasn't for my guild, I would have been gone much earlier.<br />
<br />
Just started WoW about a week ago. I have 4 level 10 toons, I enjoy the Druid and Warlock the most. I can't wait until I get home from work so I can finish up the bear form quest and finally begin unlocking our true potential.<br />

I also had a 58 Druid that I used pretty much whenever I needed a break and wanted to solo for a while.  I also tried EQ2 for several months as DE Necro and really struggled to immerse myself in it. <br />
<br />
I really did enjoy the Druid, but survivability was a major issue.  A couple good pops from a 60+ mob and I was toast :)<br />
<br />
When I moved to WoW I was going to resurrect the Priest here until I realized that they can only wear cloth!  So Druid it was, and I havent been happier in a long time with a toon!</div></div><hr />
