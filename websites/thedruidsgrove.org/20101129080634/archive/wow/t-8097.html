He doesn't respond to me, and neither does any other resident of the Moonglade for clues.<br />
<br />
Are the medallion piece spawns the same as the Alliance side locations?  If so, this quest is going to be horribly difficult for a level 17 Tauren druid to complete.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts, hints, or links for help?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. first one is in darkshore, in the water where cliffspring river goes into the ocean, rock formation that looks like a claw, and guarded by several threshers. <br />
2. second one is in westfall, West northwest of gold coast quarry, you'll see a huge anchor near where the deep ocean and fatigue start, bubbles whcich give you breath are just to west of the anchor. (shamelessly stolen from Thothbot).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both halves of the medallion are inside black chests you have to open.<br />
<br />
1.  First half is located in the Barrens, at the bottom of the Sludge Fen -  the pond northeast of the Crossroads.  Really easy to get once you clear your way to the water, killing the mobs in your way.<br />
<br />
2. The second half is on the coast off Silverpine Forest, at North Tide's, directly west of the beached shipwreck.  You have to swim FAR and DEEP to get it, so stop at the bubble crevice to refresh your breath, then keep going west along the bottom of the ocean.  Fatigue sets in before you reach the chest, so prepare to die if you're not fast enough.  I died trying to swim back to shore once I got the medallion, but the important thing is I got it!  :)<br />
<br />
Seal form looks cool, and quite scary-looking!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I was smart, I would have screenshotted my map and marked it.  Both of them have the clues for the quest.<br />
<br />
I died about 4 times diving off the shore of Silverpine.  Did you know that ghosts can get fatigued and die?  :crazeye:</div></div><hr />

NOT outside town. Ppl keep saying SW of town which lead me down near the cave and the orc wind rider. There's a NE gryph master directly south of town on the other side of the lake but it costs like 8 silver to use her. The free ones are just outside the 'loop' in the town. Still up on the hill near the rest of town. I was using TP and then heartstone almost every time until I discovered them. I thought people were talking about the one on the other side of the lake.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the second part for both tauren and NE is nearly the same. I died several times too. The chest is on the underside of the tipped boat for NE. I read that it was on the 'far side' which lead me to the back near the rudder etc. There is a nice bubble shell half way down the cliff from the anchor right before you head down to the boat. Again, this is for NE. Thottbot has good info on the quest which I used to find the NE parts.</div></div><hr />

Mostly due to the swimming in deep, dark, open water. If you head west off the shipwreck, look for the jagged drop-off. It gets really deep after that. You're basically on the border of the Great Sea. If you head a little north from the jagged drop-off, you'll see some bubbles (AIR!) and the lockbox you're looking for. You should be able to do the whole thing without getting fatigued if you stay out of the Great Sea.<br />
<br />
I was more frightened than my Tauren I think because of all the haunting years of Shark Week and watching them bait great whites with slabs of beef. I only saw a few sharks and waited bravely (thankfully I was underwater so wetting myself didn't do much) for them to pass.<br />
<br />
If you're having trouble finding the shipwreck, head northerly from The Sepulcher and then west soon after you cross the little bridge, and over to the coast. Can't miss it. Thanks for the previous posts here, they were invaluable.<br />
<br />
I never did find the people in Moonglade I was supposed to talk to for more information...</div></div><hr />
