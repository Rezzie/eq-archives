<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you have 2 accounts and one computer and you wish to transfer items between accounts....do you use the old fashioned method?<br />
I find an empty building in an empty city like north freeport. I drop the items to the floor. I then login my second account and pick them up.<br />
Is there a better way?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karanthal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/gu can anyone hang onto this for me a sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tejaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Due to limited game time, I solo 100% of the time. I do not belong to a guild, nor do I have friends on my server. So /gu is not an option.<br />
Is 2-Boxing an option?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regnon was correct.  There is a program out there called EQW (EQWindows) that allows you to play EQ in a windowed mode and switch between windows to &quot;two box&quot; on a single computer.  I have no idea whether it is considered &quot;illegal&quot; by SOE standards but I know if they made a fuss about it they would lose a ton of second &quot;box&quot; accounts.  :)  <br />
<br />
Also, I have personally been asked to transfer items for some players out of the blue.  When I ask &quot;why me?&quot; the response is &quot;because you have decent equipment already, are a level 65 and you are from a known guild that wouldn't need my stuff&quot;.  I am not recommending you use this method, but it makes some sense.  Keep in mind, however, that there are many in the so called &quot;uber guilds&quot; that would take your items *just* to be mean as well.<br />
<br />
If you use the &quot;drop and switch accounts&quot; method, remember if you can't get back on for some reason, you lose everything  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oakdad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks the the people that bring us EQWindows and EQPlayNice playing 2 toons at once on a computer is lag free for me.  Also make the bazaar lag free for me.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ndainye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If your system can handle it you can load two instance of eq on a single computer just alt enter to take everquest into windows then ctrl alt r to release the mouse start a second instance and load up the other account.  Depending on your system specs you should at least be able to get the 2nd character up to do a transfer.  <br />
<br />
With my current system I can sucessfully 2 box without eqw this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For playing 2 EQ's on one machine it's HIGHLY recommended that you get a hold of a program called EQ PlayNice.  You can get it here:  http://teqim.sourceforge.net/<br />
<br />
It forces EQ to multitask properly by inserting an instruction into the main loop that passes control back to windows to do maintenance, etc.  What's sad is it would take FIVE MINUTES for a sony programmer to actually change this in their live code, and yet they dont bother...<br />
<br />
So, get that, and get EQWindows from http://eqw.eqhackers.com/ , which is a friendlier way of running 2 eq's from the same directory.<br />
<br />
Just remember if you decide to keep using EQPlayNice that you'll have to update it after every patch.</div></div><hr />
