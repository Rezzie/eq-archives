I think I have too much melee stats involved in my rings so I'd give up the Assault Band for something magic/hybrid oriented but I'm not sure about that.  Also, what enchant should I slap on the Hammer? (strange to have my weapon enchant options completely open, but hey, that's Moonkin) :thumbup: <br />
<br />
If you've read this far, and not asleep, then I'd really appreciate any feedback you can give.  Also, any suggested level 49 Moonkin specs would be great.  Thanks a ton!</div></div><hr />

In that case, you can get MUCH better weapons if you really dig. Got a level 39 1h mace yesterday with a higher attack than yours in SM cathedral, though I'm rather interested as to where you got your off-hand item. Right, now I'm using the Eye of Paleth, even though I'm feral specced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks pretty good in general, I wouldn't put anything too expensive on your weapon as you probably will be losing it in 5-10 levels as you find better stuff.<br />
<br />
You need more +dmg to spells, I had a green ring around your level called band of the unicorn with +13 dmg, and the Archaedic ring of the owl from Ulda with caster stats and some armor was also nice.</div></div><hr />

and possibly start farming ironfeathers for the ironfeather set.<br />
<br />
go with winged helm out of your two choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geiss</div><div class="date">05-10-2006, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great suggestions guys, I hadn't even considered +spell damage gear, I'll look for some rings tonight and possibly replace some of my greens with +spell damage gear.  <br />
<br />
The Hammer is epic and I bought it (very cheap I might add) mainly for the proc as I've read it procs often.  I am open to change though if I can find better but I've also read that melee damage is still important as a moonkin (was a pain in the arse getting my weapon skills up to prepare for respec lol)<br />
<br />
I do plan on staying at 49 for quiet awhile so enchant is important to me, but I'm not even considering Crusdaer, Lifestealing etc.  Was thinking +spell damage now though even that will be pricey. (but farmable)<br />
<br />
Anyways, keep em coming with any suggestions or gear examples.   I appreciate every little bit. :smile:<br />
<br />
edit: swearword: I just read the Ironfeather suggestion.  I had no idea that item was avalable at 49, great tip!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I put it on my warden staff at a cost of nearly 300g, now in moonkin I have great AC and a nice damage kick, but I have had close calls on upgrading to many other weapons with more stats suited to casters, but it always comes down to the investment in that enchant.<br />
<br />
I can't get rid of it, it was so expensive, and now it is my...precious</div></div><hr />

Thanks again for the tips guys. :clap:</div></div><hr />
