<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-07-2009, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wooot, finally got it last night with some help from my 'guide' and a couple of guildies.<br />
<br />
we started of at Pinnacle which had caused us so many problems on tuesday, not to mention nice high repair bills !<br />
<br />
this time we had 5 of us not 4 - and 1 was was a dedicated (raiding) healer with like 15k-16k hp and 21k mana !!<br />
<br />
we seemed to be doing something that got the place to bug - the mage ran into the long passageway and then back out ?  we then ran in and down to the end with no mobs to face ? the boss then appears way back down the other (starting) end and 1 person had to go and aggro him to start all the mobs come out from the little doorway ?<br />
<br />
anyways we killed him with ease tbh - i was swiping for my life and keeping all the mobs on me. healer doing good healing and the dragon goes down followed by the main boss man.<br />
<br />
we blew through the rest of the place to.<br />
<br />
then onto Gundrak heroic....the 1st time we took on the boss someone forgot about some mobs from behind ? so they killed the healer and then wiped us ! (remembering that 3 of us had only ever been into Gundrak once the few days before when we realised we had to kill the boss to get the door open!)<br />
<br />
2nd time it was clockwork and we moved on down to the Elder and then also for fun took out the boss near him -a Devilsaur type thing? who seemed to keep ignoring threat and just racing off to someone else ?<br />
<br />
so all in all a good bit of dungeoning and a few nice loot items to.<br />
<br />
Plus my first ever Emblems of Heroism ! lol.<br />
<br />
The healer after even said great tanking which was nice to hear from a) someone who is in a big guilding raiding 25 mans and b) considering i've never tanked anything other than 5 man heroics plus c) not actually having tanked any 5 mans since BC!!<br />
<br />
<br />
to cap it all yesterday was a very successful day as after I got the Elder title my 'guide' said he wanted a quick bit of help in Crypts to kill the last boss - he could solo the whole place just not the last boss (he's a fire mage).<br />
<br />
thinking that i'd not got that achievement and knowing that i seemed to think there was a Nagrand quest for it that i needed for Nagrand Slam i went off to help. we blew the place apart, as you would expect. and for me it was nice to actually see it given i'd never been in there before !<br />
<br />
killed the boss - got some mirror - back to Nagrand to use it on ancient orc ancestors. and to cut a long story short it gave me Nagrand Slam which was the only think i needed to get the Loremaster of Outland that i'd been stuck on for a few months. not being able to find the last 2 nagrand quests needed.<br />
<br />
then i also hit Exalted with the Knights so picked up an epic chest.<br />
<br />
and then i finally finished looking around HF so i finally got the World Explorer achievement and title to :D <br />
<br />
so now i am looking for more lvl 80 normals to work on Wrym / AC rep followed by some easier heroics - like VH that's been mentioned for my Trickery and a nice meta gem helm :)<br />
<br />
so all in all a good day.:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 titles in one night? nice... i still have SO much of the Eastern Kingdoms to explore it's not even funny, and i don't know how many quests in each zone of Outlands to complete... i figure i'll get it sorted out one of these days...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grats!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-07-2009, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah indeed it was quite a day.<br />
<br />
well being a player from Day 1 of Wow i'd always done a lot of questing and exploring in Kalimdor and Eastern Kindgoms.<br />
<br />
Yeah skw - just like buses - none and then u get 2 titles in one day and now dont know which one to choose...... all i've been for ages now is Kheldar Jenkins !<br />
<br />
so atm i've chosen Elder cos the Festival is still on so its looks good :)<br />
<br />
lol and then today doing some dailys i got the 'Loot 1000g' achievement. :D <br />
<br />
to go with the one i got a few days ago for getting 10,000g - from questing - The Bread Winner - which i thought was a great name. :devil:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a bit too cosmetic for me!   I would rather try and get new loots or somthing like that.<br />
<br />
Grats to those who got it though!  That is not an easy task to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gratz Raging...i think iforgot that you go it to :)<br />
<br />
Yeah i was the same to start Solar.<br />
<br />
And tbh i'm still pi$$ed at Blizz for not granting me all the achievements i've really got in 4+ yrs of playing that i supposedly have to go do again /cry</div></div><hr />
