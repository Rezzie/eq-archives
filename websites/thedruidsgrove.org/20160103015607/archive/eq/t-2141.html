The central, square room in the castle with the chest in the middle and various halflings (Bob the painter) that wander through now and then, it has corridors leading off to all 4 directions and a secret wall too.<br />
<br />
Actually pretty much anywhere in the castle is safe, so just pick a convenient spot, but the treasure chest room is the most common.  I've been bound there for a year or so and I frequently see other people there when I make my nekkid visits...<br />

Edit:Also gonna need a group or so, Lil isn't druid soloable I dont think. Haven't been up there in a while but she does hit pretty hard and summons I believe, Unless you can charm The while stallion?.. Like I sad it's been a while since I was up there.</div></div><hr />

It's hard because the MR is so insane.  I didn't tash her when I tried, I just went ahead and killed her, while double boxing my cleric.<br />
<br />
Tried Lil after.. Got her down to 20% before both my cleric and druid were OOM, and exodused at 7% health with my druid.<br />
<br />
If you could get the white one charmed, I think you could solo her, it's just a matter of getting her charmed, and hoping it doesn't break.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go bind in B&amp;W.<br />
Grab Jumbo gorilla king. debuff, charm. Don't snare for now, it'd be annoying. SOE him in fact.<br />
Now drag him to the nearest MAZE entrance you know. There's a couple, some nearer some farther. Drop yourself down into the maze, move a little in one direction and wait.<br />
<br />
Eventually he pops down to you. You're all set ;-)<br />
<br />
Using your map of pom which includes maze, head around to the area under black and white. This is in the NE segment of the maze kind of close to the entrance-only door to the middle of maze lava room thing that leads in there from the EAST section of the maze. If you can find this entrance you are on the right track (don't GO IN Tho!). It's kind of impossible to explain in words, so track Lil or white stallion, and make a key /target Lil which you spam.<br />
Eventually you'll find yourself in a corridor right under Lil. The corridor section you are in will be just after a corner, and you would be heading west, having come a little north.  <br />
<br />
Okay -) Break charm, snare that gorilla if that's your thing (personally I don't bother, I want charmed summoning pet to be AT me for recharm), recharm and buff him DS + Haste. Don't tash, Lil gonna do that for you =p<br />
<br />
/targ Lil to get set.<br />
ready?<br />
/pet attack!<br />
*GATE*<br />
<br />
you appear before pet. He's running around the bit of maze corridor. Very soon he'll phase up he- oh there he is beating Lil ....<br />
<br />
IIRC Lil is an enc. So expect that helpful tash on your pet (and you, bah! did you buff mr? yeah? good =p) ... also you can expect slow to sometimes be used on pet.<br />
A useful tactic with enc is to cure tash. They will often waste more time casting tash again. Since pet is busy beating them, that's good if it's on you that it's casting. Also, you can cure slow, don't forget, so don't say &quot;pet slowed, forget it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Both these horse are nightmares, which means super high MR, proc blind, and tend to have insane aggro pattern - they will often stop fighting person X and go fight person Y instead. Solo fear folks will know the drill .. another example of a nightmare is that horse in LFay .. the one that runs up, HTs you and runs off laughing insanely? I think it had something to do with epic, but I don't recall now.<br />
<br />
Just stay out of melee and let pet do ALL the damage (you won't land much anyhow). Heal pet as needed. Lil can max hit pretty hard, altho it can also min hit often for hardly anything. Remember pets in general have less &quot;AC&quot; than you, they tend to get hit more often and take more damage.<br />
<br />
It's totally possible to survive charm break too, even more than one break per fight. First time I did this, I had 2 charm break, one from Lil Pillaging (anulling) pet. I also had 9 + other stuff anulled on myself, and recast, and went on to win.<br />
<br />
Once you kill Lil ... med to full. rebuff. med to full. rebuff pet. Med TO FULL !<br />
Hand in horn to white stallion - don't KILL white stallion.<br />
Do quest if needed and get quest part. However, BE READY !<br />
Once you hand in, /pet attack the mob that pops. It's a higher level version of Lil. A harder fight, but basically the same deal. And higher level mobs in pom have more chance of dropping ... thrones.<br />
Killing white stallion is a total waste '-/ It drops junk =/<br />
<br />
Regarding binding in pom .. Initially bind in the centre chest room with the halfling(s), as mentioned above. Once you know what mobs you are looking to farm (most likely one of - Alice3/4 + stomples OR B&amp;W OR Chests .. possibly pups but I doubt it) you can decide where you want to be bound for convenience. I hate running from center chest to alice, and Alice3/4 + stomples / B&amp;W were my primary targets. Binding outside alice4 / stomples room allows you to quickly access what you'll probably be looking to kill most often, and in addition you are one quick click away from that old familiar centre chest room. (click pic in stomples room). This to me was most convenient, saving me many runs thru alice. BUT you WILL see less nekked chicks, because all the lightweight pommies bind in chest room ... and probably only kill something once in a blue moon .. kinda like those people who bound at TD port room and now don't wanna change it because it can't be put back ;-p<br />
 Due to egress we can easily rebind at chest room without needing a map to get back there (without debuff from gate too .. run &quot;around&quot; em kinda),  and once you know map, you can tear around pom so fast being bound at chest will be an annoyance more than a help.<br />
<br />
Also, don't try soloing B&amp;W before you have done stomples imo, he's much easier. Stomples kill, solo, just fyi = charm the skunk you will later hand in stomples drop to to fix faction...  he's just along the corridor there, between stomples and alice 4 door. Stick him on stomples from across the room, follow in at a distance, root, snare, heal and nuke as needed. If you can't survive stomples fight charm break .. I doubt you can kill B&amp;W .. not because charm will be broken in B&amp;W fight (no reason it should) .. but because the mobs have insane aggro patterns and you are likely to get hit and blind at least once.<br />
<br />
Tips on being blind? - either (was at full health before = run around and hope pet gets aggro back till you can see) OR (was at 50 or &lt; health = heal self as estimate *2 to get to full then run around!) UNTIL != blind.<br />
Generally you'll drop aggro again because the mobs are mad.<br />
<br />
Tips on charm breaks - mobs you attempt to kill that summon (most .. non-summoners are junk) should ALWAYS be rooted and ensnared.<br />
Corners are your friend. Time the summon. Run to corner, begin casting and instantly get summoned - run back to corner and hey, you're in same place, so no channel needed, spell has cast, grats recharmed pet.<br />
You can try this technique out more easily by taking a (wimpy) summoner .. say .. that ogre at end of upside down. Root him, snare him, etc. No pet for the practice here.<br />
Go to nearest corner. Nuke him so he summons. Run back to corner, get summoned - get a feel for the summon pause duration / timing. Okay, now summon ... run back to corner .. wait .. wait .. click epic! ... summon ... run back to corner.<br />
Epic has a longish cast time so you get room for error here. When you can do epic no problem, you're all set to try CH on yourself, and progress to recharm during summons.<br />
Another thing to consider is recharm with a DAMAGED summoning pet and summoning mob. The trick to learn here is that you have 2 mobs summoning, and one moving (pet). Now, you want to stop one moving initially. So you want to root pet (or possible scenario is summoner target broke root).  When you root a summoner you kind of &quot;set&quot; the start time for their summon pause cycle. So you can have summon-mob-1 ... 5 sec pause summon-mob-2 .... 5 sec pause ... summon-mob-1  ... this is bad because you have LESS time between summons to do anything, and probably are being summoned to different places making it much harder to channel / complete a spell.<br />
A better situation is Summon-mob-1...1 sec or less pause .. summon-mob-2 ... 9 sec pause  ... summon-mob-1 etc.<br />
It's something you can get a feel for, and get used to setting - root ASAP AFTER summon, not half way thru summon pause. Usually more likely to be set by getting summoned, tank the summoner and cast root on 2nd summoner who has just got into melee range and so won't summon either. This is doubly nice because you don't get bounced across the room by the summons either (both mobs summoning to same place).<br />
<br />
One final note, if you spend any serious time in PoM, you'll eventually end up looking at chests. Pulling the middle chest therefore :<br />
<br />
Middle chest is an enc. When aggro'd, he'll cause the halfling to depop and a bunch of mean nasty halflings to pop and assist him. Personally I ended up pulling him out into the water to kill him. So, Snare him .. halfers pop, and likely it casts on you. Run up the stairs to get &quot;out&quot; towards the pearly gates .. you're gonna train here. Run along till you see halfers coming for you, and root them all. Snare if you wish. However, main task is to let chest get to you. Run around the gate and drop into water. NOW MAKE SURE chest is snared.<br />
Ok .. egress.<br />
Chest'll be in that water area somewhere .. usually where you left him, but sometimes he'll have time to move a little back towards the platform (gates) .. usually won't get far tho. Dependant on your zone time. Head into the water, and pull him now solo .. and kill where you like.<br />
All other chests are much easier, requiring little effort. As for why kill chests? The usual reason. Thrones.<br />
<br />
Summoning, charm breaks, and pets that summon are not things to be feared, but understood and controlled, in the same way we control pathing when pulling, aggro when nuking or healing, and so on -)<br />
<br />
Okay .. waaaaaaaay more than was asked LOL. PoM itself sucks, drops are so terrible. XP is the pits. Every druid should go there tho, to learn some very important druid skills, namely the A-Z of summoner soloing, and charming 202. And for 5 minutes it's a cool zone. Get a group, kill flurries in north tov, play in pom for an hour, and have them all enjoy the &quot;elite&quot; zone some will never see .. then leave. But ..once they log .. gate back there and get your skills up -)<br />
<br />
Also, as a fyi, my first time in pom I was 60 (no aas then) in incomplete HoT armor, most people hadn't heard of NToV, and our server was just getting over the whole CQ / sleeper thing. So while some of the stuff listed needs more than that baseline to be reliably done, it's all formed on a core of (by today's standards) reasonably junky gear and just working out what WAS going on, so I could kill some stuff in this crazy zone.<br />
