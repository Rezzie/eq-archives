<br />
after our second week arenas, we're starting to get it together. He's a little undergeared PvP-wise (he only has like 120 resil) and we're not sure that combat spec is the best for PvP... can someone point me in the right direction spec-wise?<br />
<br />
if someone can give me a link to an armory as a point of reference that i could forward to him, i would really appreciate it... <br />

<br />
he's got everything now on his druid, circa 400 res.<br />
<br />
i know he spoke to some other rogues who have done a lot of pvp/arena and checked out specs so i will have a chat with him today.<br />
<br />
atm i know he is Combat specced. but i am not sure if that's going to be changed or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, this rogue looked at some specs and talked to some pvp rogues and came back with a 20/0/41 spec as the best one.<br />
<br />
as usual with blizz nothing is available to link :o</div></div><hr />

Sub offers so much in terms of control and options, and Shadowstep is amazing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">08-19-2008, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a subtlety talent called Shadowstep.<br />
It's basically like a blink strike ability - they appear behind the target and get bonus damage on their next move.  It can be used in or out of stealth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">08-19-2008, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep.  It is the 41 point talent in the sub tree.  Which is why almost all rogues go with 41 points in sub, then the rest in either assasination or combat, with assasination being the most common place to put the remaining 20 pts.<br />
 <br />
Also, sub rogues get Cheat Death (annoying as hell), Premeditation (automatically adds two combo points to target), Preperation (automatically resets all cooldowns) and a ton of other annoying ass talents.<br />

Strong Sub / Assasination build looks like:  http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fbe0RgZZxMjoMGRsbst</div></div><hr />

<br />
this forum is awesome... i have forwarded information to my team mate for PWN spec, so hopefully with a little more PvP gear  for him, we will start making kids cry the battlegroup over :)</div></div><hr />
