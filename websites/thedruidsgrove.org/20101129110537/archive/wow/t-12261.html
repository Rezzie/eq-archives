This gives you the percentages.  Its probably up to date, but it depends on the spell you cast as to what percentage you get.</div></div><hr />

I was cruising through that link reminding myself of my Holy priest alt's coefficients when I checked on the warlock coefficients (my best friend is an affliction lock). Good God! No wonder locks are so OP. They have massive damage coefficients! It just pisses me off so badly when I'm in AV and can't even run past a lock on my epic mount at IWGY without dismounting to heal through his DoTs (which means certain death anyway). It's way past time for Blizzard to nerf these coefficients. <br />

If our cat DPS would only scale like that...</div></div><hr />

I know resilience will reduce the damage I take in a PvP situation, but it's just wrong that a scrub lock in quest blues and greens can force me, in my purples with resilience of &gt;200, to dismount and heal up. No other class can do that. It's just WRONG. It's that kind of imbalance that cheapens the PvP experience in WoW.</div></div><hr />

You'd be amazed at how far they'll chase you when you tick them off like that.</div></div><hr />

I started to stay and fight ... The more resilience I have gathered I began to survive more fights ... even though I might be out of mana or left with 2% health at the end of the fight ... Each fight is always a learning experience and maybe (cross fingers) I will always win ... :crazy: <br />

And Yes, Blizz needs to adjust something to make them less powerful ...</div></div><hr />
