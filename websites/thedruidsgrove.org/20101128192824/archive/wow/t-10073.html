+100hp to chest.<br />
+100hp to head.<br />
+9 stam to bracer.<br />
+7 stam to boots.<br />
+8 intel to legs.<br />

Rod of ogre magi (+30 spell damage enchant)<br />

blood of matyr<br />
Hide of wild<br />
Eye of beast<br />
Diremaul +44 healing trinket.<br />
<br />
so in total I have +130 healing, not alot I know but this druid is my alt and I dont run MC with her yet.<br />
<br />
my spec is currently 24/0/27, I feel I dont need innvervate since I can manage my mana pool, and when needed for feral I have the best gear from scholo/strat/ubrs I could get for it.<br />
this spec gives me mana reduced spells and faster castings.<br />
<br />
is it worth spending days and days in diremaul runs to get +damage/healing gear do you think?<br />
<br />
confused and not sure what to do. I mean I want to start doing MC/ZG/BWL on my druid but its to much time &gt;.&lt;.<br />
<br />
what to do?</div></div><hr />

It starts with a quest in Burning Steppes called Dragonkin Menace.  You can obtain the quest from an NPC in the camp in the South East of the zone.<br />
<br />
Onyxia differs from MC/ZG/BWL in that there is very little in the way of trash mobs, and the entire instance will be over in about 30 minutes or less.  It can take a while to learn the fight if your guild has never done it before, so you'll have to get used to wiping whilst everyone figures out what to do, but once you're attuned and you can get into her lair, killing her will provide some awesome loots, including the Stormrage Hat, which looks like a pair of antlers! :)<br />

That does not mean you should put of MC if you have access.  Get the tidal loop quest before you go to MC.<br />
<br />
Get Ony keyed early.  It's even more frustrating if you're not earning xp from the long, I mean really long, quest line.</div></div><hr />

Silly druid, innervate isn't for you, it's for priests. Unless you are in love with your spec, innervate can make a huge difference in a new MC guild. <br />
<br />
IMO, yes the DM + healing gear is worth it. You really don't want to rely on crit heals, because they are inconsistant and tend, at least in my experience, to make you pull agro. +healing also allows you to use lower rank Healing Touch and manage your mana even better.</div></div><hr />
