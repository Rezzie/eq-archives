Increases the Attack Power reduction of your Demoralizing Roar by 40% and the damage caused by your Ferocious Bite by 15%<br />

Thick Hide - 5 / 5<br />
Increases your Armor contribution from items by 10%.<br />
<br />
Soon i will hit 60 with my new druid and the respec comes closer...<br />
I only can choose one, what do you think is better for mainly normal gameplay like grinding for mats (leatherworking ;o) ), faction and pvp.<br />
High end instances are not my maingoal because spending enormous time in mc killed my playing-fun almost a year ago and I will not repeat that *g<br />
I will be almost full feral (11/35/5) and do play with a rougue and a shadow priest mainly so I am the tank the most times or switch to cat if the mobs are easy going.<br />
<br />
So considering this what do you think is better 40% more AP reduction (+ the cat goodie) or 10% more AF.<br />
I am not into maths but maybe somebody already did the calculations :)</div></div><hr />

Is the armor bonus from Thick Hide applied to your Base Armor Value, or only applied in Bear/Dire Bear? Assume 2K base AC:<br />
<br />
Apply to Base:<br />
2000*10%=200+2000(base)=2200*360%(dire bear)=7920<br />
<br />
Apply to Form:<br />
2000*370% = 7400<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So again, is the armor bonus from Thick Hide applied to your base armor or the form?  I figure it'd have to be base b/c it should help in cat form as well....</div></div><hr />

The most you will get out of it is 225-275 AC, and moving from 7400 to 7650 just isn't worth the cost of all those talent points which could be put to better use somewhere else.<br />
<br />
You will have plenty of AC without thick hide, and you could always get a piece of gear with a little AC on it that will get multiplied into moonkin/bear form (archaedic rings, tortiose band, smoking heart of the mountain, mark of tyranny, etc...)  Why not use those points for talents that can't be mimicked by gear, like iSF, or Nature's reach, or Insect swarm, etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok wait...now I'm a bit confused.  Let's just say I have a base AC of 2000.  The thick hide @ 10% would boost it to 2200.  Which one of these is correct:<br />
<br />
A)  2200 * 360% = 7920AC<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
B)  (2000 * 360%) + 200(from TH) = 7400AC<br />
<br />
If it were &quot;A&quot; then I think the extra 500AC would be extremely beneficial.  I guess my question is, how is Thick Hide calculated into the bear/moonkin form armor?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not use those points for talents that can't be mimicked by gear, like iSF, or Nature's reach, or Insect swarm, etc...<br />
<br />
How beneficial is Nature's Reach?  It doesn't seem like much if the range is 30 yards...@ a 20% improvement it only becomes 36yards....I mean, is that really enough to spend 2 talent points in?<br />
<br />
Thx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I firmly believe it is B, but I am locked in a debate with someone else at the moment that swears it is A.  Sorry if that doesn't clear things up.<br />
<br />
On nature's reach, what I meant was there is no item in the game that can get you more range, but there are tons for more armor.<br />
<br />
I had nature's reach when I was nearly pure balance, and I can say it is a neat talent, wish I still had the points for it.  You can find a sweet spot where you can root opponents/mobs and they can't fight back even with their ranged attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balzinn</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neither A nor B is correct the way you wrote them.  When it says 'increases armor by 360%' it means it adds 360% to your base, so the multiplier is 4.6.  Also, you will always at the very least have a small contribution from Agility, so your entire base will never be multiplied.<br />
<br />
http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=10366&amp;page=2<br />
<br />
Thick hides will change the multiplier on the armor value listed for an item from 4.6 to 5.06, not 4.7. (base*1.1*4.6)<br />
<br />
Caster/Cat AC = (Sum.of.armor * 1.1) + 2 * Agility + Enchants/Kits/SetBonuses<br />
<br />
Bear/oomkin AC = ((Sum.of.armor * 1.1) * 4.6) + 2 * Agility + Enchants/Kits/SetBonuses<br />
<br />
If you had 3,000 armor as a caster and 10,000 armor as a bear, which seems way out of proportion, you'd have 10,900 armor as a bear with thickhides.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">05-17-2006, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a good point, when most people read the multiplier they expect to see 4.6 times their armor in caster in bear.<br />
<br />
If you mouse over your armor on the character portrait screen, it will show your base and then in green all the stuff currently added to it that won't multiply.</div></div><hr />
