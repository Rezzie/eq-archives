What would you suggest I work on increasing next? Hitpoints or Armor class? Or should I me looking at improving one of my other stats (or resists)?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hp is much more important than AC for a druid.  It helps keep you alive against any type of attack, not just melee.  For me it's a slightly higher priority than mana pool even...<br />
<br />
Resists are important too.  If you can't get gear that has good resists and good stats, at least work on a set of resist gear--things like a crown of the froglok kings, for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember that as you go up in levels both the WIS cap and the mana cost of the spells you use will go up significantly. Whilst your mana pool is OK now, there's no reason at all to stop increasing it.<br />
<br />
Resists are also important to work on, and don't underestimate focus effects and flowing thought :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Considering Time Gods...<br />
<br />
Resists<br />
Mana<br />
Hitpoints<br />
<br />
Although considering that most things in elemental and time have loads of hp/mana, really the only real consideration is resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not convinced about resists either, even capped with bard song at 500 it's still often very hard to resist some of the AEs in elemental planes.  And until that, resists have always seemed pretty overated to me (for example, I resist spells more with my 65 bst and 120 resists sometimes than with my druid and her 200ish resists). I can't say for Time though as I am not yet there, but at 55 I wouldn't worry so much about it yet.<br />
<br />
Sta is easy to cap with buffs so HP better, personally I go FT&gt;HP&gt;mana&gt;resists&gt;wisdom, but that's because mana is rarely an issue.</div></div><hr />
