I've decided that I'm actually going to participate in a World Event for the first time through it's completion. I like the title, and it seems fitting, seeing as how I'm a little older than most people that play (i think so, anyways). Along with the the fact that it seems fairly druidly, since Elune is in Moonglade and all, I figured that it was my Druidic duty to become an Elder (along with that other achievement of getting exalted with Cenarian Circle, but i'll do that later, at a point yet to be determined)<br />
<br />
There's a link posted in Thottbot to guide that I'm going to use. I'll do some research on the coords given in the guide and report back after I've completed everything.<br />
<br />
Anyone else planning on becoming an elder?</div></div><hr />

I really want it for her for a few reasons: Like you, I'm towards the leading edge of the bell curve of WoW player's ages, and Rhus' guild is...<br />

<br />
kinda like the title was made for us. :-)<br />

A good walkthrough:  http://www.wowwiki.com/Elders#Walkthrough_for_All_Coins:_Alliance<br />

<br />
i've talked to all the northrend ones now - after finally going into Wintersgraps last night for the first time just to find the one in there !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">01-28-2009, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, talk to all the elders.  <br />
From wowhead: <br />
Complete the Lunar Festival achievements listed below. Elders of Eastern Kingdoms<br />
 Elders of Kalimdor<br />
 Elders of the Alliance<br />
 Elders of the Horde<br />
 Elders of the Dungeons<br />
 Elders of Northrend<br />
 Lunar Festival Finery - Purchase a festive pant suit or festive dress with Coins of Ancestry. You only need 5 coins to purchase one.<br />
 Frenzied Firecracker - Shoot off 10 Festival Firecrackers in 30 seconds or less. You can buy these off the Lunar Festival Vendor in any major faction city (Not in Shattrath or Dalaran) and Moonglade.<br />
 50 Coins of Ancestry - Obtain 50 Coins of Ancestry, easy enough to complete with all the Elders you need to visit.<br />
 The Rocket's Red Glare - Shoot off 10 Red Rocket Clusters in 25 seconds or less. You can buy these off the Lunar Festival Vendor in any major faction city (Not in Shattrath or Dalaran) and Moonglade.<br />
 Elune's Blessing - Defeat Omen in Moonglade, the quest you need to pick up is Elune's Blessing<br />
<br />
<br />
I read one estimate that it would take 6 in-game hours to complete the achievement.  Most folks in my guild report around 8-10, up to 13 hours.  Then again, I don't know how co-operatively they've been working it, summoning folks in once a dungeon is cleared, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm just over halfway done with the first 5 achievements, and have probably spent 2-3 hours, but haven't done any of the Northrend Elders yet.<br />
<br />
Note that one of the dungeon elders is only available in heroic Gundrak, so  only LvL 80s can complete the whole achievement and get the title.  Also, the Elders of the Horde/Alliance require you to go into the opposing factions cities to visit the elders.  I have had no real problem on my care bear server, but even there I've seen folks camp the elders waiting for the Horde to show.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, to a point.  The guards at the capitals are all high enough level to detect you, but the lesser settlements they really aren't a concern.<br />
<br />
For example, I stealthed/ran right into Undercity and Thunderbluff for the Elder, but in Orgrimmar a couple of friendly Hordies took me out.  After I got the coin from the Elder.  I'm not sure they knew that the next coin I needed was about 50 yards from the graveyard where I rezzed, outside Razor Hill, so they actually did me a favor. :-)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you'll definitely have an easier time with those at times of day when there are fewer players online.  The guards are usually not that hard to stealth by, or ignore for the lower level ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-29-2009, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i stealthed all the way through and around Stormwind last night after posting the above.<br />
<br />
No one got a sniff of me...not a guard nor player regardless of level.<br />
<br />
The only time i was wary was when some stealth detecting Lvl 80 Elite NPC whose name escapes me came patrolling around the area where the Elder is ?<br />
<br />
I took a good look around Stormwind cos i'd never ever been there ! quite a pretty place and big !  The map i was looking at to locate the Elder on wowwiki placed him at the docks !! so i stealthed all the way down to the docks only to realise that the description of his location 'The Park' did not match the co-ords i was fixed on using :banghead_ <br />
<br />
I spent a while before actually talking to the Elder cos of ally's of varying levels nearby plus NPC's (low level) to either side which i was not sure if i could avoid pulling.<br />
<br />
At one point i was right behind the Elder and suddenly a 80 Hutner raced up on a mount scaring me to death ! :p   But he obviously did not 'see' me.<br />
<br />
When i did speak to the Elder i pulled a lvl 40 NPC which i killed fast and then re-stealthed and headed on out of Stormwind.<br />
<br />
I got out unscathed despite it being gone 20:00 last night and hence quite busy in the city !<br />
<br />
That actually felt like an achievement ! :thumbup: :thumbsup: <br />
<br />
Gotta do the other cities tonite i guess !</div></div><hr />

I started Eastern Kingdoms last night with a hunter guildy... He had a much rougher time in Stormwind than i did, even though all he had to do was wait while i stealthed in, and then haul a$$ through the city to my location. From there, we took the tram to Iron Forge with the same tactic. He died about 4 times overall, i died once in Stormwind when a few 80 alli discovered our presence after we talked to the elder, so we just rez'd at the Spirit Guide.<br />
<br />
There are a couple places where I've never been in Eastern Kingdoms, like Burning Steppes (except for once when i was summoned for a BRD run), and Searing Gorge. How do i even get to those areas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completed all the old world ones last night, and about half of the northrend ones too.  Now to stealth in to the dungeon ones that I can, and get groups for the other.<br />
<br />
Oh.  And Omen.  :-(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">01-29-2009, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Possibly.  He's a world boss with 5.5M health if summoned by a lvl 80.  There's always a bunch of skeletons around his spawn place whenever I check in Moonglade to see if there's a group taking him out...<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that his stats vary with the average level of the group that summons him.  I'm tempted to have a lower level guildie druid summon him then a few of us 80s take him out.  I seem to remember him reported as having 1.5M health if summoned by a level 45ish druid.<br />
<br />
In any case, it takes a well coordinated group or raid to take him out.  I wasn't there for it, but 5 of my guildies took him out by themselves.  or so I'm told :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
it really felt good to stealth around Stormwind and i enjoyed seeing the place for the first time ever !<br />
<br />
I stealthed through Ironforge last night and got that Elder to :)  Seemed easier to get to - not to far inside the city and not on a most popular route ?  <br />
<br />
Quickly talked to him when no one was that near and hoped i could survive without being seen by anyone til the stealth CD had gone ! lol<br />
<br />
Tram to Ironforge ? Dunno about a tram ! :o<br />
<br />
Still i felt it was an achievement to get another Ally city Elder.<br />
<br />
1 left to do tonite hopefully somewhere !  Cant even rememeber which one its called ?<br />
<br />
Omen : i did him last weekend on my own !!  let me explain.....apparently you can get he credit for killing him by just being there when he dies ?  i was there when a bunch of ally's were trying to kill him of all levels not just 80's.<br />
<br />
And yes he had 5.5 million HP's ! and it took us all a while to kill him.  Ally's tagged him but a bunch of horde were also joining in for the kill and doing dps etc  When he died we all got the Achievement so he's not to difficult as i am sure there are always people taking him down ?<br />
<br />
Only 5 took him down Raging ?  Hmmm must have taken them a while if 5.5 million HP and he was doing some damage to me as melee and i went bear tbh for more survivability and i still had to run out a number of times and heal - granted no one was healing me as i was on my own killing him ! ;)<br />

I keep hoping that I'll run across Omen's recently killed corpse and get the achievement done that way, but no luck so far. :/<br />
<br />
And I have a bit of skepticism about my guildies being the _only_ ones on Omen at the time... Maybe he didn't have full hp when they engaged him, or there were other folks around beating on him.<br />
<br />
But they are a few of the best players in the guild, so who knows?</div></div><hr />

i remember in the old days or proper wow (TM :p) of struggling for every copper. i could not afford a mount until lvl 42 or 43. took ages to pay 800g for epic ground mount.<br />

now money is sooo easy. i cant find enough BoE items to buy !<br />

A couple of dungeon runs, and Wham!  First (and likely only) Title!<br />

I have all of the Horde Elders, and finished the last Alli Elder last night. I ended up crashing out Thursday night instead of playing. My wife and i were a little exhausted over the events of the past week. We had our interview with INS, and our petition for a Greencard was FINALLY approved... Going from a J1 Visa to a permanent resident can be a bit of a nightmare...<br />
<br />
Tomorrow I plan on hitting up the Elders of Kalimdor, which shouldn't take too long, and Monday finish up the Elders of the Eastern Kingdoms along with the the Elders of the Dungeons that are in EK... That will leave me with Omen to complete, and the Elders of the dungeons that are in Northrend.<br />
<br />
Kheldar, im down to about 5,000 G (most I've ever had is about 10,000) after powerleveling my LW to 440, buying Haris Pilton's Gigantique Sack, and getting my upgrades 'chanted, i feel broke... lol... I remember back in the days of BC, after buying my riding skill, having something like 5G left... I'll start the quests up in Icecrown once i've gotten Exalted with the Sons of Hodir, so more money should be headed my way... I'm also sitting on a TON of mats that i can throw on the AH, so we'll see what happens... I WANT that chopper!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i am gonna work on the dungeon one over the next few days.<br />
<br />
where are you trying to move to/from Skw ?<br />
<br />
well in original wow i never had any money.  hard to make money and rubbish money from quest in the old days.<br />
<br />
once BC hit and dailys it was a piece of cake and same with  Wrath.<br />
<br />
as i've said b4 i feel its much easier to make money with gathering profs and selling stuff from these on AH than by trying to sell crafted stuff - esp for me as a non raider.<br />
<br />
i did not bother in the end with Haris's bags. stoopid money.  currently a guildie is making me a ton of primal mooncloth and i am getting lots of these made for not too much cash given you can pick up primals cheap<br />
<br />
chopper ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
okay, so i've completed the Elders of Kalimdor, Northrend, Alliance, and Horde, and downed Omen last night.<br />
<br />
I still have 4 more to go to complete the elders of the Eastern Kingdoms, and the elder in Strath is the last instance elder that i have in the old world, then i need to get the instance elders in Northrend. I spent almost an hour and a half looking for the elder in Mara, having only been there once before on a &quot;Princess run&quot;.<br />
<br />
It took a while on the lower Eastern Kingdoms, too, namely LBRS... I had never been there before. While i was there picked up the FP's for Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge, so i may go back at some point in the future to pick up my World Explorer achievement.<br />
<br />
I expect to complete everything for the Elder title by Tuesday evening. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-03-2009, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i've done all the Elders in Old World Dungeons. I just need all the Wrath ones.<br />
<br />
Hopefully i've enlisted the aid of 2/3 80s who are going to take me to all of the Wrath Elders tonite :)<br />
<br />
Yeah Skw - the Mauradon one was a pain - its a big place and not that easy to navigate - and like you i reckon i've been in there about 3 times total in my Wow playing ! I still never worked out how to get to the Princess cos i wanted to kill her for the Mauradon achievment whilst i was in there :(<br />
<br />
I was ok on all the Eastern Kingdom places, incl dungeons as i've done BRD/LBRS/Strat to death in my time and explored all of the Eastern Kingdoms on my way to World Explorer (just gotta do HF and SP now!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-05-2009, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm getting there !!!<br />
<br />
tuesday night i went into some Wrath 5 mans for the first time....i kept getting <br />
<br />
'Discovered Nexus' 'Discovered Azol'  etc etc :p<br />
<br />
We basically ran the whole of 3 normals as some of the people who were helping me were below Lvl 80 and were keen to do the whole place for rep/xp/quests/to see the dungeons/for loot !<br />
<br />
we blitzed the normals - no stopping, straight through, no  real tactics on any bosses - once or twice the mage leader said a quick do or dont (he was the only person in the grp who had been to any of these 5 mans :p) otherwise i just pulled everything and swiped away !<br />
<br />
a 77 DK picked up as couple of blues as did the 75 mage.<br />
<br />
i think we did all of Nexus / Azol and some other place whose name or location escapes me !<br />
<br />
However when we went to try Pinnacle we struggled totally - we had to lose the 75 mage for this due to low level so we had me 80 tank, 80 mage, 80 pally and a 77 DK.  the hunters gave us some problems but we just failed to control the boss mobs to allow us to get harpoons and fire them ?  least in here i got a bit of rep for wearing a tabard !<br />
<br />
gonna go back again to try to do that.<br />
<br />
then we took a look at heroic gundrak but the 'door' was not open ?  after a few resets someone found out that Blizzard patched it so u have to now kill the boss before a door opens allowing access to the Elder :(  so again tomorrow/sat take a few 80's and kill mobs and boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night people were busy so we did not get a lot done.  So instead i decided to see if i could stealth my 2 remaining Elders (excluding Pinnacle and heroic one).<br />
<br />
quick check on the net and then ask people where Halls of Stone was ! ;)<br />
<br />
So i managed to stealth to and complete the Elders in :<br />
<br />
HoS<br />

I've finished the Eastern Kingdoms, and only have like 4 (i think) more elders in Northrend dungeons. Tuesday I ran heroic Nexus, and got started in heroic UP. We got the [Incredible Hulk] achievement while we were there... That hallway is truly a tough fight though... we wiped a few times and then my wife came home from work, so i had to log. When i logged on later, I asked one the guys I was running with if they had finished it and they had, so, still having that raid ID, I stealthed all the way through heroic UP to the elder! Once i get the elder in heroic Gundrak, I think Im just gonna run regular to finish the rest... it's getting close to crunch time, and since I'm raiding tonight, I won't get a chance to work on it at all :(</div></div><hr />

for heroic GunDrak, i had a warrior buddy tank, his friend was a resto druid and came along, and then 2 rogues from my guild. I initially thought &quot;uh oh... ALL melee dps&quot; but we burned the place to the ground... kitty swipe + FoK*2 = pwn face<br />
<br />
I stealthed through Utgarde Keep, wasn't careful, and went all the way to the final boss without finding the Elder there. Feeling cocky after soloing 3 mobs twice to get the fire barriers down, I tried to solo the final boss... and failed... got him to 59% but since he was immune to stun, i coudn't pop out and heal... after a quick thottbot check, came back in and found the Elder there very quickly.<br />
<br />
Stealthed Drak'Theron with no issues, and well as Halls of Stone.<br />
<br />
I tried stealthing Azjol-Nerub, but found out that i had to down the first boss for the door behind him to open, so i spammed /g and the same 2 rogues were ready to rock. After begging a priest in our guild to come along, we dragged a guildy's alt through with no issues... well, except that it was my first time there, and i had NO idea where the hole was... lol..<br />
<br />
first title: check<br />

If you're interested in getting the achievement and the title, even though you only have a week left, if you go to thottbot, and look up the Lunar Festival event, and under Elders of the Dungeons, you'll find a post directing you here (http://mmo-worlds.blogspot.com/2009/01/world-of-warcraft-to-honor-one-elders.html) this guy gives a good route to follow for knocking out the elders on all the continents and the dungoens... there are a couple mistakes on coords here and there, but overall, with this guide, a week is PLENTY of time to knock this out... Good Luck! Let me know how it goes!</div></div><hr />
