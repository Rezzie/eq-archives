<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">01-30-2008, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I knew from lvl 1 that I'd have to maximize my CE rep in order to get my Earthwarden.  So, before I even hit the outlands I had 360 plant parts ready for turn in.  I turned them all in before I did a single CE quest.  Honored in 60 seconds.  Bought my heroic key at lvl 60.:eek: <br />
<br />
Since then I have completed every CE quest in HFP, Zangarmarsh, Terokkar Forest, Netherstorm and a few in BEM.  Now I'm revered.<br />
<br />
With maybe 2000 rep left in BEM (if that), that leaves me with 19K rep to earn.  Assuming 1600 rep per SV run (I assume some trash is left behind, but I get a few armaments to make up for the loss), I have 12 SV runs to complete!  Yuck!<br />
<br />
Unless I get lucky and find 3 DPS'rs (I have my own Pally healer) willing to do the same, that could take forever.  At least 4-6 weeks (probably more).<br />
<br />
I think I just might be able to get more interest in Heroic runs.  Which is easier?  Heroic Underbog or Slave Pens?  I assume Heroic SV is the hardest.<br />
<br />
Is there another way?  Maybe kill a bunch of trash each day in SV with my healin' pally on days in which I can't get a full run?  Is that worth the trouble (assuming we can do it)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
and i was not clever enough with the plant parts etc and was only a little bit into revered by the time i'd done every quest.<br />
<br />
and i'm basically not in a guild so it was grabbing people i knew or just from LFG.<br />
<br />
i reckon i went from 3k/12k to Exalted in under 3 weeks. just meant concentrating on SV normal and finding others who wanted CE rep for wotever reason.<br />
<br />
also i bought a few coilfangs if i ever saw them cheap in the AH just to keep the rep ticking along.<br />
<br />
never tried heroic's - not sure how much of an increase a heroic run would get you over a normal ?  and ofc would need to compare time taken for both.<br />
<br />
i struggle for time so a quick dash through normal SV was relatively easy to sort.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-31-2008, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice one with the plant parts :&gt;  If only I had had that kind of foresight..<br />
<br />
Are you sure you have done all the CE quests?<br />
<br />
There are some in hellfire peninsula, blade's edge mountains, netherstorm and terrokar forest too..<br />
<br />
Also, you can gain rep by handing in Coilfang Armaments, but I wouldn't recommend this as they sell for loads of money - money you will need for Swift Flight Form (obtaining this should your overriding priority; screw earthwarden tbh).<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt you would have any problems persuading people to do Steam Vaults.  It's a popular instance with players who are still too undergeared to field heroic instances with ease.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for heroic mode...<br />
<br />
Heroic Slave Pens is probably the easiest instance - in fact maybe the easiest heroic in the game.  The hardest part of the instance is the trash leading up to the first boss, but with some deft sneakiness you can actually skip most of it.  A shaman with tremor totem will help a lot with the fears.  Be aware that you might be feared for a couple of seconds, and don't fight too close to other packs of mobs.<br />
On the first boss, kill all totems except Fire Nova totems.  When you see a corrupt fire nova totem, have your tank pull the boss away from it, then kill it from range.  (it explodes for 6k aoe fire damage when destroyed)<br />
<br />
Heroic Underbog is also very easy, no particular classes needed but an offhealer can be useful for the last boss, and an offtank for the 2nd last boss.  (Feral druid!)<br />
<br />
Heroic Steam Vaults is the hardest of the three.  The trash leading up the the first boss is particularly challenging.  However, after that the instance becomes a lot easier.<br />

All but a few left in BEM.  According to this CE rep spreadsheet I have maybe 10 quests left (most are in a single chain I haven't started yet).  Totaling ~1500rep.Also, you can gain rep by handing in Coilfang ArmamentsThey seem to sell for ~10g each on my server.money you will need for Swift Flight FormWhy?  SFF seems more a netherdrake sort of thing than severing any real purpose.  I'd love to get it, but isn't a priority.I doubt you would have any problems persuading people to do Steam Vaults.  It's a popular instance with players who are still too undergeared to field heroic instances with ease.True.  Guess I'll have to see.  Since so many folks have been 70 for so long (many for a year!), I just wonder how much attraction a non-heroic, non-raid instance is for those players.  I could be wrong.<br />

Oh man, it is soooo much more than that.  Really.<br />
I could detail dozens of scenarios when Swift Flight Form shines over flying mounts, and I will if you ask me :&gt;  But seriously, the best thing about it is the fact that you can use it _while_falling_.  Whilst falling!   Nobody else can do that.  Sure, normal flight form does that too, but it just cannot possibly compare to the speedy version.<br />
<br />
I swear to god, swift flight form should be the absolute number 1 priority of every druid.  There is _nothing_ in the game cooler than it.  It's so awesome, so much fun, and such an enabler.  I simply cannot gush about it enough.<br />
<br />
It's really one of these things where you don't fully appreciate how cool it is until you have it..  :&gt;<br />

Same here. Swift Flight form needs to be a priority for druids. 5000g is easily obtainable over the span of 2 weeks if you know how to get it.</div></div><hr />

I have ~2000g now.  Though, I'd say only 1500g of that could be used for a mount.</div></div><hr />

I've been lucky to get random drops that have sold for lots, http://www.wowwiki.com/Blinkstrike sold for 1800g (I almost cried, I was so happy).<br />
<br />
I should be getting Swift Flight Form is weekend, in fact.  Myself and some fellow droods are teaming up and throwing ourselves a party afterwards.  :smile5:   <br />
<br />
And, I have to tell ya, since hitting Level 70, I've thought of nothing else.  Of course, I've had to spend gold on lots of things here and there, but SFF has been my main priority.  Choosing a Druid as my main, my personal goal has always been SFF.  In fact, I think achieving Swift Flight Form will be my Druid's proudest moment.  I just can't wait to show off my wings.  :tongue:</div></div><hr />

I'm crap at saving money.  I had to borrow 3500g for mine from a very very good friend... :P<br />
I didn't realise at that point how awesome it was though.  If I had known, I would have found a way.  Somehow.<br />

Then when you have completed all 10. Use your Collecting skills. If your a herbalist, find a DPS buddy and go up to skettis and kill the forest ragers. Then sell the herbs on the AH. Stacks of Ancient Lichen sell pretty good. Sell transmute cooldowns, tailors sell your Spellfire/moonCloth/Spell Cloth cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last night, I was running &quot;Bomb Them Again!&quot;, and as I am flying upward away from my drop, I ever-so-gracefully flew into an explosion of gas.  :bonk:   <br />
<br />
As I was falling to my certain death, Annikk's &quot;Whilst falling!&quot; quote ran through my head, and I frantically (and inwardly) screamed &quot;OMG! Click it!  Click it!  Click it!&quot;  <br />
<br />
Worked like a charm!  :clap: <br />
