<br />
If you enjoy quadding, and ME toilers aren't camped much on your server, you can run through lots of quick XP there.  It's even good for multi-root-rotting, if you have a horse and epic (assuming you have ES arms or Velious bracer).<br />
<br />
Getting a DoT group together in UP at the Elysians is also good, especially if the Elysian armor would be an upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
And the Sun Revenants in NW corner of the grey are good.<br />
<br />
At 58, the Elysians and Sun Revs will all be within 5 levels, so you get the XP bonus.  UP has a better ZEM, but Sun Revs have less HPs, so it balances out.<br />

<br />
do that until 61, then try grouping in pov or pos until 63, then solo PoS frog with CoT</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the Ancients would still be dark blue I think.  Maybe an odd Verdant, but most would be green/light blue.<br />
<br />
The BW giant fort was never that good for xp grinding IMO.  It's more for loot camping unless you can partner with a necro then you can clear it quick and constant for good xp.  Level 58 it's not that great at all for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Greek2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">quading tro jegs in scarlet desert (on the plateu thingy in the middle of the zone) got me from 57 - 60 i think... was pretty fast and relaxing :) <br />
<br />
perhaps root doting is good if you have epic (i didnt at the time)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did those a lot, too =)<br />
<br />
The only bad part about them is, when the shaman casters pop (can't remember the name), you have to root/dot those from max distance, so it slows you down a bit.  Other than that, it's a great spot to kite, along the edges of the plateau.  But if you can get to ME, umbrous toilers are better, slightly higher HPs, but always blue even to 60, no casters, and more spawns to grab.<br />
<br />
When I was upper 50s, though, ME was heavily camped, and SD wasn't, so it was more convenient to go there.  Nowadays, ME is probably only lightly camped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For plain out cash, as opposed to bazaar loot:<br />
<br />
Seb - take a tank type or small group; necro camp is best but all are pretty good<br />
HS - now has gems in the loot table; mobs typically drop 4 plat; lots of named with droppable loot<br />
Droga - mobs typically drop 15plat; a good group can kill constantly<br />
Veksar - mobs drop 8 plat; some *very* nice camps for single groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faddin Wolffin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ok tyvm for all the info i will be trying these within the next few weeks</div></div><hr />
