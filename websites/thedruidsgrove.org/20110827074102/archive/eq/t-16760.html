If I have an account with the secret question/answer and all. And I wish to transfer from one server to another, will I be able to?<br />
Or do I get stopped because I do not have the CD key? I did transfers years ago and I don't recall if I needed the CD key, I don't think I did.<br />
Did anyone transfer a character recently or an account? Do I just need the original owner information and secret question/answer?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I wasn't asked for any CDkeys or anything else.  its pretty automated now, it takes a couple of minutes once the payment is verified.</div></div><hr />
