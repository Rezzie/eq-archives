http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/object/article?f=/n/a/2010/07/13/national/a141951D08.DTL&amp;o=0Iowa billboard linking Obama, Hitler removed<br />
<br />
(07-14) 10:35 PDT Des Moines, Iowa (AP) --<br />
<br />
An Iowa tea party group on Wednesday replaced a billboard comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Lenin, calling the sign a bad decision that reflected poorly on the organization.<br />
<br />
The roughly 200-member tea party group had the original sign put up last week. It showed photographs of Obama, Nazi leader Hitler and communist leader Lenin beneath the labels &quot;Democrat Socialism,&quot;&quot;National Socialism,&quot; and &quot;Marxist Socialism.&quot;<br />
<br />
After the billboard drew sharp criticism by other state and national tea party leaders, members of the local group sought the change.<br />
<br />
Johnson said Hitler images are usually not allowed at North Iowa Tea Party gatherings.So we have a party that welcomes white supremacists/neo-Nazis, and uses fear and hatred to rile up their ignorant members (who are the biggest users of socialism), comparing Obama to Hitler, with the slogan &quot;radical leaders prey on the fearful and naive&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are so many levels of hypocrisy here I don't even know where to begin.  I would have never thought that any party could outdo the &quot;Republicans&quot; when it comes to hypocrisy.<br />
<br />
Then again, with Sarah Palin as their avatar, I should have expected as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also curious that they decided to use a picture of Lenin under &quot;Marxist Socialism&quot; instead of, you know, Karl Marx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">07-15-2010, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ehh probably because Karl Marx was an economist, he never actually tried to implement his model.  Lenin actually used his own version. Leninism, with Stalin implementing his own policies, as did later with the chinese variant, forget the name of it.  Just McCarthism at it's finest.  Rather than pick apart the economic policies of Obama, and the macroeconomic troubles this may cause both now as well as the future,</div></div><hr />

So this group welcomes NAZIs, but then compares Obama to Hitler?<br />

Is this a recruitment ad, Tudamorf?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We, in the last 24 hours, have expelled Tea Party Express and Mark Williams from the National Tea Party Federation because of the letter that he wrote,&quot; Webb said of the blog post by Williams that satirized a fictional letter from what he called &quot;Colored People&quot; to President Abraham Lincoln.<br />
<br />
Webb called the blog post &quot;clearly offensive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Williams wrote the blog post in response to a resolution by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that called on Tea Party leaders to crack down on racist elements in the movement.<br />
I have a feeling if they kick out all the racists their tea party is going to fit inside a tea-pot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd call it a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black, but would the political correctness police call that racist too?</div></div><hr />
