That art is pretty bad.  FV looks totally unrealistic.  Not only her Breast but her waste looks like one of those victorian corset women.  I'd say she is missing just a few ribs.  Not only that her face isn't as appealing as I have ever seen it.  I'm really wondering what happened to the artist from LDoN.  This art looks like someone hired a kid out of highschool to do it.  It's almost Anime like.</div></div><hr />

Heck of a first post ehhh?  Long time player and former druid that has at long last come back to the class.

<br />
Anyway, I retired a couple days before GoD, so I'd never seen the new FV, till this thread. The first thing to come to mind?<br />
<br />

<br />
Specifically the anatomy bit (if I could find the column that dealt with the clothing appearance on boobs, I'd link that too)<br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does the dark elf girl look like she's drawn by someone completely different?<br />
<br />
At least FV can keep the constipated axe guy company. I don't know if he is supposed to be a berserker throwing axes or an escaped extra from a Conan rip off.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I quit.</div></div><hr />

My DH would love for me to have a toon that looks like her! Or hell, would love me to just look like her, forget having a toon like that. :D</div></div><hr />

As I recall, the first elf princess was an enchantress.  She was being held in High Hold Keep and there was a quest to save her.  She was on the top floor behind a fake wall.  She wore chainmail (WTF?) and had an enchanter pet.  A little while later the quest was killed off and then Kunark came out.<br />
<br />
And her bust could be worse.  They could be beach ball breasts!</div></div><hr />

Or do you stare at it all night, caressing it's tender form, whispering soft words of contentment in its, ehm, ear, and then get into a frollic??<br />
<br />
Actually, don't answer that :p</div></div><hr />

or perhaps a Wizadin.<br />
She's got large breasts<br />
and a dimple on her chin.<br />
<br />
She's a saucy minx,<br />
there ain't no denyin'<br />
the girls all hate her<br />
and the boys are all cryin'<br />
<br />
But one thing is certain<br />
its just the death of me<br />
there ain't much that rhymes<br />
with Firionia Vie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HOWEVER.... I have never seen a lingerie model carrying a staff like that before.  Victoria's Secret has some catching up to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tadarri</div><div class="date">05-06-2004, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always referred to them as &quot;BowlingBallBoobs&quot;. You leaf through any gamer magazine and 99% of all the 'fantasy' female pics have Bowling Ball Boobs. Majority of the graphic designers are males. So, we got a bunch of boob men out there. [grin]<br />
<br />
Also, at one point the patch screen chest area of Firiona was disproportionate. Like she has a boob job go bad. The cleavage was wrong. Don't they have any females reviewing these graphics for accuracy? LOL - there's a job title for ya. <br />
<br />
just my 2cp worth, be gentle. <br />
