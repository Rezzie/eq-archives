Its about as useful as Booboo. At best its a small HoT for when you wipe and are in the middle of rezzes. <br />
<br />
It dies (quickly) to AoE's - heals for very little - and has a very long recast time. Oh, and best yet - doesn't stack with other healers wards. I spent the AA for the first level just to fill out my druid toys - but it has no real function.<br />
<br />
If youre nearing max AA or close to 30 saved, then if you MUST spend points I would only train the first level. Heck, if you have that many AA you might as well start your resists. /shrug<br />
<br />
With the amount of Aes and area damage in Time, your ward has no chance....I know mine doesnt!</div></div><hr />

Sigh, and I had the first level of NB and just bought Level 2.  So in 6 more AA, I will again have to buy something.  What about Tracking?<br />

I am *hoping* the next expansion will use NB and/or Tracking as prerequisits to some usefull extensions to these two GoD AAs.  Well, I can always hope... Please tell me there is hope!</div></div><hr />

However, if I refuse to run ShowEQ on my second computer, then it still has a use, yes?<br />
<br />
I've always felt that it would be inappropriate to use ShowEQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendul3164</div><div class="date">07-02-2004, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too refuse to use ShowEQ. Takes a lot out of the game IMHO. <br />
<br />
As far as tracking, if you need to spend AAs somewhere - then by all means I would work tracking. If nothing else, itll help you scout name mobs for whatever you desire. I could see it being particularly helpful in the larger build GoD zones (KT etc).<br />
<br />
Im assuming you have the other GoD AAs already complete...thats a lot of soloing ;)<br />
<br />
P.S. There is always hope. Thats what alt-twink berserkers are for!  :clap:</div></div><hr />

Hopefully you did not purchase it until you have no other marginally useful AAs to buy.<br />
<br />
If you were foolish like me, you can use it:<br />
1.  After a minor wipe, when many rezzes are done.<br />
2.  In an exp group if you know you won't be moving for the next 5 minutes and pulls are inc.<br />
3.  An raid encounters where the mobs don't have any damaging AEs (do these exist anymore?)<br />
<br />
Remember:  clerics, shaman and druids all have the same stupid boon ability and none stack.  The times this AA are useful are so few and far between that you really only need 1 person in all of these 3 classes to get this AA to cover it for everyone.</div></div><hr />

(like 60hp/tick or something)  Group replenishment (40hp/tic) plus Nature's boon (25hp/tic) totally counteracts it in those cases. For 6 minutes.   <br />
<br />
For example, for the past two weeks my guild had been figuring out the Rathe Council encounter.  I was in a TM group with a cleric for up to an hour at a time, TM'ing a dot casting mob, so we took turns plopping our wards down to help counteract the AE.  It helped a little. :)  <br />
<br />
(we finally beat Rathe and entered Time on Tuesday, woot!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm... My plan is to start getting Nature's Boon at 607 AA (currently at 394 AA).<br />
<br />
NB beats out such dynamite AAs as Hastened Exodus, Convalescence, Packrat and Advanced Innate Strength.  :)  Maybe I'll move up Hastened Exodus and Convalescence. Really scraping the bottom of the barrel at that point.<br />

<br />
Some mobs with aes will kill it ... others won't. I have no idea how this works but there are some mobs with dd ae effects that are very hard to resist that my ward sits there and laughs at. <br />
<br />
I use it for - soloing summoning mobs, xp or ldon groups where we are stationary, and some raid mobs (note this is GoD raiding... have no clue how it works in PoP as we stopped raiding Time when GoD came out). <br />
<br />
Im up to level 2 now and have nothing else I want to buy... so saving for higher levels rather than waste the aa points.</div></div><hr />

I used to try to get my ward out of range of the AEs, but the ward's range is so small that it's just not worth the effort.  If they made the wards immune to spells, and maybe made clerics, druids, and shaman have different (stackable) effects on them....</div></div><hr />

I does die to aoes, but you can pop it out to heal the mt who is getting dotted by a single target spell, or with a few casters, pop them out after waves of aoe.  Still, its pretty much worthless.  :)</div></div><hr />

Not really.  I pop out Boo Boo, and the wood elf chicks start clustering around wanting to pet the cute furball.  <br />

I pop out the invisible monkey, and they all run away....  :cool:</div></div><hr />

Do you know that the ward can be moved by using the spell Summon Companion? With that said the ward is still pretty useless, but at least I don't feel like I &quot;wasted&quot; it if I bring my ward out then the group moves.</div></div><hr />

of course i'm a regen freak anyway.<br />
42 regen UN-buffed and climbing :P<br />
with regen, NR, the ward, po9.. i can bust 200 hp a tick<br />
<br />
BUT, something i would like to of seen is the ward maybe curing too.<br />
perhaps 0 at level 1,<br />
1 counter off all at level 2,<br />
2 counter off all at level 3,<br />
3 counter off all at level 4,<br />
4 counter off all at level 5<br />
<br />
i think the OoW upgrade will do some of this,<br />
but wow that's 45 AA just to start getting some curing!!<br />
<br />
<br />
That would be real sweet for those fights where AE dots come into play.. <br />
probably make Quarm more trivial than he is, and several GoD fights.<br />
<br />
And yeah i drag my ward around with me everywhere and still other druids ask how did you do that?? haha</div></div><hr />
