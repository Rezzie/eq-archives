<br />
As it is now, if you take Moonglow you give up tree form(as crappy as it is, it's 20% less mana on HoTs).<br />
<br />
Being able to take Moonglow and tree form together basically means you can heal indefinately. Or having Swiftmend, Moonglow, Lunar Guidance, and Dreamstate altogether. I believe that's why Moonglow, Lunar Guidance, and Dreamstate are as far down as they are. Threat reduction is nice. <br />
<br />
Your Imp Moonkin aura has no number listed on the mana% gained. <br />
<br />
Zehpyr Embrace is OP'd. Essentially what you end up with is a 12 second CC spell that can't be dispelled that has a .5 sec cast time. Add to that that the target can't be healed by allies even and doesn't heal while cycloned and it's just crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as for the % gained by imp aura, i went with 2%, which even at a pool of 10,000 only gives back 200, so as to avoid a never-ending wrath cast.<br />
<br />
with ZE im trying to make cyclone more useful in terms of PvE. as it is a 6 sec CC where you spend a quarter of that time casting it is pretty much useless, unless you are using it as a short-term CC (i.e. keep a mob off you while your healing so the tank can snag it). if you are balance and attempting to fill in the role of a casting DPS class it is extremely limiting to not  have a viable form of CC, especially when so many of the instances in BC -require- CC. i made it 12 seconds because that is half the time of a mage's sheep and the warlock banish. as to the .5 cast time, that could certainly be left out or brought up to 1 sec.<br />
<br />
what about the tree summon buff and the 41 point talent?</div></div><hr />
