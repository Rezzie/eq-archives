no wonder i love them, the first toon i rolled was a rogue, and i never really grew out of my thieving ways lol<br />

Generally with a good experienced group you can run one instance in 30 minutes, with an inexperienced group maybe 45<br />
3 badges per run plus extras for dailies :)</div></div><hr />

I got reported by a group by they were told by a GM that I was just using all my abilities to its maximum potential and not exploiting any flaw at the time. So take it from blizzard. Its perfectly legal as long as your not exploiting any bug. (Wall Jumping was an exploit so if you were doing that in SP heroic to skip a whole lot of trash then yeah you are cheating.(Wall jumping has been fixed since a while back so its sorta a moot point.))</div></div><hr />

Thats how I got my WH boots off that big spider (Mother Smolderweb or something).  I think I steathed with a group of 3 druids and 2 rogues for my WH shoulder in LBRS too.<br />
 <br />
Never though of doing stealth Heroic boss runs... not a bad idea.  Known a few rogues / druids that stealth herbed in some instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-01-2008, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the best instance for druids to farm Ancient Lichen is Steam Vaults.  If you take the route from the entrance, across the large first room, then into the water (nearby the first boss).  You can then swim right down the channel and come up again much later in the instance.  From there go and sneak around the goblin boss picking the herbs there, then jump back down into the water and stealth back out again the way you came.  Averages 4-6 lichens per reset plus some other herbs.  Can get a stack in less than an hour :&gt;<br />

Clever use of in-game mechanics, IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solo Killing the Guardians in Ungoro for your Cloak.<br />
Stealth running Lord Roccor for your feral idol.<br />
<br />
Its never been cheating.  Its very dangerous in most cases and takes a decent amount of skill to pull off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tankwhomee</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so does anyone know any other good heroics that can be stealthed?  I would love to stealth Ramps for Thrallmar rep!  Pity about the dogs.<br />
<br />
Oh well, another month and I can run most 70 instances in groups of 3 with a couple of lvl 80s lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favourite instance of all time for stealth runs is LBRS, but that's a bit low for these days..<br />
<br />
Ramparts may still be possible.  The way to get past the dogs is to have a druid stand nearby in a safe place and cast Soothe Beast on the dogs from a safe range, while the rest of the group sneaks past.  The druid then recasts on each dog one final time and stealths past to join the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
Of course it might be faster to just kill the dog packs, but if you want to try to do the whole thing properly, for Science&#8482;, that is how I would go about it.. :&gt;<br />

<br />
for pure stealth science we may yet give the soothe beast a go :)</div></div><hr />
