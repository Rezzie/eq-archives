 I was just talking with a couple  warriors in our guild about defense and becoming uncrittable. They have told me that achieving 415 def. to become uncrittable was the mark at lvl 60. They then told me that the new mark for lvl 70 is 495 def..<br />
<br />
 Can anyone verify that this is correct? Once again im sorry if i missed this in a previous thread.</div></div><hr />

So we only need 2.6% reduction with defense that is 415.</div></div><hr />
