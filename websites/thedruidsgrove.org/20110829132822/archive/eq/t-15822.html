Highlight:<br />
Our next expansion will be released in November. This will give us more time to polish the game content and features. I am also happy to announce that November will be the month for all future expansion releases as well.</div></div><hr />

I was sort of tired of expansions being deserted after a new one was released. I still have no idea what the point of TBS is beyond a nifty hand augment and some armor.</div></div><hr />

If you have a &quot;normal group&quot; (tank, slower,healer) you can do most of the katta missions earning Orux to purchase your spells (RK2) and gear upgrades.<br />
If you do not have a Normal group there are still missions available that can be done with root rotting or pet tanking tactics.<br />
The Burning Sea/Coast missions are easier than the katta missions and once again there are options for a non typical group to earn Doubloons and get DoN+ level gear and spells (RK1).<br />
The choice of instances again give a stress free place for people to play without worrying about KSing or people skills.<br />
<br />
I haven't experienced the Progression content of TBS so am unsure about what these zones have to offer, perhaps someone else can describe the benefits of endzone TBS</div></div><hr />

I just don't have the time to cover all the stuff.<br />
<br />
And loot keeps getting better, all the hard work of ploughing throw PoP, GoD and OOW and not group loot is like CoA stuff. Its gone too fast for me and I have been &gt;.&lt; this close to calling it quits since TSS.</div></div><hr />
