Well it finally dropped, and so insued the loot drama.  Our guild has always run loot as a primary spec gets first shot at loot and then offspec gets a shot.<br />
<br />
This is inherantly a problem when your Bear tank wants/needs the item but the kitties want it too!<br />
<br />
My biggest arguement for the staff being a &quot;bear&quot; staff first is that Heigan drops the exact same staff (-714 armor / +51 crit) which is a DPS staff IMHO.<br />
<br />
As a bear I am supremely bias here, what do you kitties think?  Should this item be considered a &quot;Tanking&quot; staff or a &quot;Feral&quot; staff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
kittehs should be more concerned with The Undeath Carrier, Cryptfiend's Bite and The Journey's End, by far.<br />
<br />
The ONLY reason why i would even roll on The Origin of Nightmares is because I'm currently the only feral running in Naxx25 with my guild, and i'll do anything to keep this from falling into huntard hands...</div></div><hr />

no point of arguing here</div></div><hr />

<br />
when i did raid all the loot had been set a priority based on class and spec -as well as the rule always being that a main had preference over and alt and a main spec had preference over an off spec.<br />
<br />
i'm hoping to get cracking in VH soon for the Staff and am wondering who else i'll be rolling against for that one.</div></div><hr />

I was the RL/ML for the raid, but our GL was with us.  Since I had a vested interst, I let him decide.  Since he was unsure, he said let the dice decide...and the dice hate me!!!<br />
<br />
Well, hopefully it will drop again.  We full clear everyweek, so I should have another shot at it.   <br />
<br />
The most disappointing part, is the feral who won it, I think knows it was a tanking staff, but didn't want to admit it when we were debating in loot council.  Life goes on.  <br />
<br />
Our GL got straightened out after the raid though, and in the future, it will be given to feral tanks if present.</div></div><hr />

However, the stats are so similar that it's good enough for both. The only reason why I have one is because they drop like crazy, and Heigan and Kel'Thuzad are cheap asses.</div></div><hr />
