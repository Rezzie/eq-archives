<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maporfic</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just came back to EQ in mid December. Found my main deleted (59 druid) and no GM would touch the issue (it had been a long time since I cancled). <br />
<br />
Anyways, took 5 weeks to go 1 to 60. Here is how I did it:<br />
<br />
1. always get a kie if you can. One of the best things about being a druid is the ability to bind, port to nexus for kie, and port back to the camp. <br />
<br />
2. hunt Reds when possible:<br />
<br />
1-10ish yard trash - crushbone whatever. engage blast blast blast. <br />
<br />
10 - 14ish lava storm - snare, dot, Vs-summond-blast blast blast. <br />
<br />
14-19 KFC in SK or Pould Caverns in Luclin. <br />
<br />
19 - 30ish (yay nexus port spell) - SK outer paw - snare blast blast blast. <br />
<br />
30 - 39ish kited Hill Giants (good cash) quading would be great at 34, but I couldnt find my velius disk to get to IC. (not sure if I needed it, but didnt bother to try)<br />
<br />
39 - 52ish Mass Quad Spirocs in TD - At 49 with KIE I could pull like 12 spirocs at once and quad till dead. somthing like 3 blues per pull. (Also a good money maker if you find a necro to sacrifice. one pull = 300 to 700pp).<br />
<br />
52 - 54 Quad Raptors - perhaps the slowest exp in my journey, but keep grinding and it comes quick enough.<br />
<br />
54 - 60 FAST exp in POP. Did bout one level per day charm kiting Rats in Plane of Disease. I actually stepped it up a level, and started Charm-Agro kiting for even better exp and NO downtime.<br />
<br />
60+ you can continue in PoD for decent exp, or get flagged for PoS if possible (trials are a pain if you dont have high dps friends, tried it with an ALL 60+ group, 2 rangers and a warrior, failed miserably). In POS root dot frogs in forest is bout the best I have found so far. Grouping is always an option I guess. AGro kiting Frogs in Forest with a mage friend is great exp as well. Got a yellow in bout an hour last night doing that. <br />
<br />
Charm-Agro Kiting:<br />
Ensnare spell slows movent 55%. Our AOE snare spell slows movment 65%. So pull a rat (pestilent or swamp prefered for most dps) Ensnare it, glam, charm. Now, pull a goo, rat, lavarian, fly or whatever with the AOE snare. Kite the mob around using FLAME LICK (best agro spell we have for the mana). After 3 or so Flame Licks, send in the pet and keep kiting. You will keep agro while pet hits mob from back. <br />
<br />
(NOTE: the lvl 60 OGRE NPC that wanders PoD about does NOT summon, gives NO faction and is generally a WUSS. Nab him whenever you see him for a NICE boost of exp.)<br />
<br />
If you get adds, pull pet off. Snare the adds up, get some agro on them and continue with original mob as before. The trick is keeping them snared since the aoe snare is only one minute long or so. When charm breaks, simply resnare, reglam, recharm. <br />
<br />
With KIE I am never ever lom doing this non stop. <br />
<br />
My 2¢, hope this helps someone,<br />

I used to use flame lick a lot to agro stuff.  The damage was so small I guess I never thought it did any damage.  This was *way* before Lucy. :)</div></div><hr />

Don't forget to do at least 1 point of damage to the mob do the charmed pet doesn't take half the xp.<br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
There was a patch awhile back that changed that. The pet can do ALL the damage, and the caster will still get full xp. This holds true for enchanters, magicians, necro's, etc ..</div></div><hr />

You must do atleast 1 dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goldenpine</div><div class="date">02-21-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, you must do 1point of damage. I went to PoD and charmed a Diesesed rat and with it, i killed 4 other rats before I got 1% norm exp, I then remembered you had to do damage, so I started doing my ES arms on them. the next 4 I got 3% exp. You deffinetly HAVE to do some damage. <br />
<br />
Now, dont quote me on this, but I believe, if you do 50% or more, you get FULL exp, if you do under 50% damage you only get 75%.<br />
<br />
Not sure on that tho</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maporfic</div><div class="date">02-22-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WHERE in POD: this is a tuff one, but I found the perfect spot. Follow the zone wall to the left, when the wall turns to the right, just go straight out (have invis up). You should run right past a lvl 60 diseased malarian or two... keep going. Run towards the cliff you see in the distance. There is a long valley next to the cliff that you can kite in. Very very rarely will you get an add once you learn the wanderers pathing.  <br />
<br />
From here you can pull Goos, Larvies (rare named genarial larvie for key quest to crypt). You can also pull from the other end of the valley diseased rats, swamp rats (under water often), flies, malarians (note some are SK's but they do not dmg you much, I have taken plenty of them -*not* the lvl 60 ones) AND Mr EXP bonus himself (the named ogre NPC) wanders right through this valley. Kill him for a NICE shot of lvl 60 mob exp.<br />
<br />
The cool thing about Agro-Charm kiting is you only need ONE pet - so buff him all you like - and your pet does not take dmg if you do it right. Also, there is NO limit to the size of mob you can take down, as long as it is snarable - noncaster - doesnt summon. There are lvl 65 mobs that fit this description in Pofire from what I hear. Dunno if there are animals to charm there, but would be fun to find out.<br />
<br />
*NOTE* you can also agro-kite with a mage friend (or BeastLord I would imagine) for some decent duo exp, in zones where there is no animals you can charm.<br />
<br />
If you want to farm some cash - go do this in WW (dragon faction HIGHLY suggested). Velius hounds make the best pets here because they naturally run faster than all mobs in zone, so you can just use regular ENsnares all the way round. Farm Velius hound pelts (selling for 600 to 800pp on Torv) or agro kite some Ice Burrowers for RARE silks (seem to sell for around 1k each here).  <br />
<br />
While your there go solo Yeldima just so you can say youve done it. Charm a Bronto (snare first) - haste him and send him in. Keep it alive with Tunares Renewal. Its a very easy fight. Yeldima roots up nice enough, so if charm brakes you should be ok to run a little ways and egress after you get summoned. <br />
<br />
<br />
AS for leveling fast: A hope defered is a pit of pestilence, but a hope fullfilled is a tree of life. I leveled fast because I had many many old friends I wanted to raid with. I had that to look foward to, so I did not mind the lonely road of soloing. I did not cut off contact with friends and family for 5 weeks to do it, simply cut out other trivial things like TV and sitting around picking my toenails.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK thats all for today. <br />

***PLEASE NOTE***<br />
My posts are NOT written for an English teacher to spell and grammer check them. They are written to be understood by fellow EQ players. I think if someone talks about a mind buff and mentions KIE you can pretty much figure that one out. Please dont waste posting space with trivial corrections.

<br />
Cause in 5weeks, that is 35days, playing 14hours a day thats over 20days played, now i am not discounting that you leveled fast or anything, just wondering if this 60 in 5weeks is viable for someone who doesn't get to play everyday, or every other day for that matter. <br />
<br />
I would like to know your /played tho, cause I hit 55 at 16days played, now that took 6months, people didn't believe me, but anyway, heh, i stayed in 55 for about 4months more, heh, now I am 57 with I think 22 days played.<br />

In off times my characture was left online for reasons I do not wish to share at this time (lets just say I made alot of plat). I can only estimate my /played time, and my best guess would be about 8 or 9 days at the end of the 5 weeks. <br />
<br />
I have slowed down alot now though, since I am of raiding level (61) for my guild. But since I am on the verge of bragging already, I will say this:<br />
<br />
*Shamless bragging*<br />
after 7 weeks in EQ: 20kpp in bank, wis 270ish, Hcrook, Lumi staff,ft1, pre-epic rdy for turn in - halfway to complete on main epic, Run3, Grandmaster brewer, lvl 61, Flagged for Bot, PoS, PoV, riding a black stalion. Its not always how much you play, but how smart. <br />
*/shamless bragging*<br />
<br />
Anyways, I hope my remarks have at least given a few folks some ideas for personal stratagies.<br />

LOL, well sure, you had already played a char to 59.  Everyone does things 5 times faster the second, or third, or fourth time around.<br />

Not to mention, you might have had uber guild support. <br />
<br />
And another point to bring up, a little thing I like to call, KEI. With KEI I bet I could get a level 1 druid up to 30 in 20hours. It really makes ALOT of difference.<br />
<br />
But it is still good, and I dunno, I have learned that people usually pad their own numbers, so I would guess your at about 13 days played for real, and how ever many more in bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno about dire charmed pets, but if by summoned pets you mean to include necro and mage pets and enchanter animations, that's not true.  I'm currently playing all three, letting my pets do the vast majority of damage.  It's especially obvious with my enchanter who is buffing the animation and debuffing/slowing the mob, and throwing in one nuke so I get the xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was changed in a patch a while back so that so long as the caster does at least 1pt of damage the pet eats NO xp. If he doesn't do any damage to the mob then the pet eats a portion, I believe it's around the 50% mark.</div></div><hr />
