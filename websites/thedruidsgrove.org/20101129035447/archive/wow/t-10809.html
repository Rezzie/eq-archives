In addition, they have posted a little bit about the new Jewelcrafting profession (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/jewelcrafting.html) coming with the Burning Crusade expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the idea that the base weapon w/o any jewels in it has fewer stat points so its just a matter of customization, or are they meant to be in addition like enchants?<br />
<br />
Also, do you think you'll be able to get enchants on these items in addition to the jewels?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you noticed the one gem's effect is straight +dmg (not dmg and heals), I wonder if this is a new mechanic we will see developing in other gear.  As far as the sockets go you can add the healing gem to to get the dmg and healing effect, but if you aren't thinking about it you might get a surprise.<br />
<br />
As far as I know the only +dmg only effect in game right now is the spell power enchant.</div></div><hr />
