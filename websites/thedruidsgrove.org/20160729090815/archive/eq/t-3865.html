Quote:<br />
-----------------<br />
You say, 'Hail, Rebecca Cabbageleaf'<br />
<br />
Rebecca Cabbageleaf seems lost in thought and looks up only briefly from her work. &quot;Oh, hello Cryth, welcome to the New Thicket Inn! If you'll excuse me, I'm a bit busy copying this new [scroll]. I'll be with you in a moment to chat, or to trade if you've come about the [earring].&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, 'What scroll?'<br />
<br />
Rebecca Cabbageleaf looks up again with a quiet smile, &quot;I'm making a copy of a new Protection spell, it's very exciting! The druids of Norrath have just completed an important ritual, and the gods have blessed us with this new spell! I'd be happy to scribe you a copy, if you were to fetch me the [ingredients].&quot;<br />
<br />
You say, 'What ingredients?'<br />
<br />
Rebecca Cabbageleaf says, &quot;Oh, let me see... I'll need a sheet of fancy Blessed parchment, a small flask of Dark Root ink, and of course a large quill. I think a Stormraven's quill would be best, certainly better than this one I've been using so far. Bring those items to me and I'll be happy to make you a copy for yourself. I'm not sure where you'll find all of those, I seem to have bought up the last of the stock in several places. Someone's bound to have them for sale, good luck with it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rebecca Cabbageleaf smiles warmly, &quot;Brilliant, you've brought me some more supplies! Here, please take this last copy I've made. I'd planned to use it for myself, but I'll let you use it so you don't have to wait for me to make a new one. I do hope you enjoy it!&quot;<br />
<br />
You gain experience!<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
1. Blessed Parchment is purchased in Rivervale. The merchant's name is Byl Babbinsbort at loc -140, -120.<br />
<br />
2. Dark Root Ink is purchased in Greater Faydark at Kelethin. Near the druid guild is a store called Bilrib's Smithy. Instead of going through the door, edge around the right side of the building where you'll find Bilrio Surecut at loc 645, 385.<br />
<br />
3. Stormraven Quill is purchased in Surefall Glade in the druid guild. The building has a sign which reads Jaggedpine Treefolk. At the back counter is a merchant named Sequea Erthinon who sells the quill.<br />
<br />
I paid roughly 284pp for the parchment, 252pp for the ink, and 261pp for the quill. This was with 100+ charisma and with apprehensive, ally, and amiable faction respectively. (I'm a Wood Elf so naturally the Kelethin folks will like me more).  <br />
<br />
Your price may vary depending on charisma or faction, but expect to pay between 750-800pp for this spell.<br />
<br />
The reward is a spell scroll:<br />
<br />
Protection of the Cabbage (NO DROP)<br />
Level 59, 500 mana<br />
Single-target version of Protection of the Glades<br />
&lt;H3&gt;TRIVIALS&lt;/H3&gt;<br />

<br />
[b]Final Step: The Sacrifice of Nine[/b]<br />
<br />
NO CHECK = NO FAIL - YIPEEE!<br />
&lt;h3&gt;COSTS&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
My current guesstimate is about 3.5K in Store Bought materials, 15K if you buy all the finished products from tradeskillers. The costs below only include Store Bought Components, it assumes you've foraged and farmed anything that is foragable and farmable (except gems). It also assumes NO fees for enchanter services and subcomponent pottery combines etc.<br />
The absolute minimum cost, assuming bought gems, is about 2.5K with no failures anywhere. If all the gems are farmed (good luck), the minimum can drop to below 1K.<br />
<br />
Here's some notes:<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Elves - Demi-Sec Champagne<br />
A 250 brewer has a 95% success rate. Cost of materials per champagne is about 35pp<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Elves - Mistletoe Cutting Sickle<br />
A smith with effective 255 skill seems to succeed 1 in 3 (based on 24 combines, 8 successes). Often 1 subcombine failure in the attempts. This works out to a raw cost in materials of about 1200pp for a success.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Elves - Golden Idol of Tunare<br />
Trivial at 242 pottery skill, success rate at 250 pottery a little better than 50%. Cost per attempt about 225pp, but be prepared to provide 3 sets of components, or just pay the potter 2-4K for a finished idol (market price depends on server). 200 skill potters have about 15% success rate.<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Man - Blessed Fishing Pole<br />
Raw cost per attempt is about 175pp. Not a lot of data on this. Guessing about 50% success rate for a 200 skill fisher.<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Man - Star Ruby Stein<br />
Raw cost per attempt is about 75pp. At 250 pottery skill success rate is about 50%. Be prepared with 3 sets of components or just pay the potter 1-4K for a finished stein (market price depends on the server). 200 skill potters have about 10% success rate.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Man - Ceremonial Solstice Robe<br />
About 300pp for first attempt, 40pp per attempt thereafter. Could get really expensive since there are not a lot of 250 tailors out there. Guessing about 1K average for a 200 tailor. I've heard of a 232 tailor charging 1K for success if you bring components.<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Halflings - Lotus Pie<br />
Raw cost per attempt is low (50pp?). I've seen people selling finished Pies for 500-1K, seems to be standard on our server.<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Halflings - Misty Thicket Picnic<br />
Raw cost per attempt a few pp (approx). I've seen finished ones sell for 500pp-1K. However, after patch the quantities have increased, hence the price should be lower by now.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Halflings - Lucky Cabbage<br />
Raw cost per attempt &lt; 10pp.<br />
<br />
So the conclusion is... farm and forage everything, pay the cost of gems and other store bought materials, find 250 skill tradeskillers for each item, and you should be able to get away with about 3.5K average cost. <br />
<br />
&lt;h3&gt;FOR NON DRUIDS&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
If you are not a Druid and you've completed the PoTC quest, go and speak with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove - She's more than happy to give you something you'll be able to use instead of Xanthe's Earring.<br />

If you're one of the few people who did the quest twice and lost an earring due to it being made lore, petition in game and a GM will reimburse you with the nine ingredients needed to make another earring after verifying your loss.<br />
<br />
If your Xanthe's Earring is out of charges, trade it in with Rebecca Cabbageleaf in Fungusgrove, and she'll give you one that has charges. When items that didn't have an effect are retroactively changed, it sometimes causes the &quot;out of charges&quot; bug. <br />
<br />
To trade the earring in with Rebecca, give her your Xanthe's Earring and she'll give you an alternate kind of earring. Give her back the alternate earring, and she'll give you a fully charged Xanthe's earring back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My congratulations to Xanthe (and my heartfelt apologies for the gender-confusion on my site).<br />
<br />
My congratulations and thanks also go out to this community - I know we'd not have sorted it out as quickly if not for both communities working on this one.<br />
<br />
When I'm less buried (and less sleep-deprived), I'll stop by here and compile any new information from here with what's over on EQTC and try to do something similar to the shawl guides with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will also be added in the final spoiler. Here we can list foraged items, ground spawns and other looted items.<br />
<br />
Iron Oxide <br />
Visual cue: these look like red lumps on the ground. (See pictures below) <br />
&lt;img src = http://www.eqtraders.com/pics/oxides.jpg&gt;<br />
<br />
Locations: <br />
Ground spawn around the huge gears on the ground near the minotaur caves. There are 5 spawns. One under the half buried gear and 4 around or on the broken gears. You can also get Iron Oxide from the steam and earth elementals in Steamfont, in the Hole and Najena. <br />
<br />
Permafrost Crystals in Permafrost <br />
Visual cue: look like the Iron Oxide. <br />
Locations: On the ground in the dire wolf pens in Permafrost, as well as on the ground in various spots of the &quot;Goblin Castle&quot;, left of the &quot;Flag Room&quot;.<br />
<br />
Permafrost Crystals also drop from the Ice Goblins in Permafrost (about 1 per 20 kills). I had them drop off Ice Goblins and Ice Goblin Wizards. They probably drop off the other types as well. <br />
<br />
Jumjum stalk<br />
Spawns in front of druid guild in Rivervale. The spawns are on a 12-13 minutes timer and look like the typical bag. <br />
<br />
Lotus Sap<br />
Looted from the Deep Lotus Vine in Fungus Grove. Best strategy to kill is to have someone chain stun them. Very annoying mob. They can also be bought on vendors in FG as people dump them there.<br />
<br />
Foraged Items<br />
Pebble Stones in Karana<br />
Wild Cabbage in South Karana<br />
Branch of Planar Oak - Plane of Growth<br />
Dragon Egg - Western Wastes, Temple of Veeshan<br />
1 vegetable<br />
1 fruit<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
1. Spending money to raise tradeskills has SEVERAL other benefits. Expect the game to require MORE and MORE tradeskills to finish quests, especially the high-end quests.<br />
2. Some people like to the challenge of solving and finishing quests... as in EverQuest.<br />
3. The reward of the the quest is the POTC scroll PLUS a very nice item for a slot that is not well-served.<br />

This game is not about seeking every shortcut you can find.  The purpose is to have fun.  For some people that means raiding every night, for some other people that means working on silly quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Niami, we almost had a double post regarding the tradeable items!<br />
<br />
Regarding the Iron Oxide, I can confirm that the ground spawns in Steamfont are still working.  I picked up 3 Iron Oxide this morning.<br />
<br />
However, I do not know what the story is about the Stone and Iron Guardians in Nektulos Forest.   I tracked the whole zone and especially the locations that were known in the past and  I did not see any of them. It is possible that they are very camped and insta-killed but I am also wondering if the mobs did not get changed when they upgraded the zone. Does anyone know?</div></div><hr />

Yes, the jumjum dropped by Nillipuss, the jumjum sold by merchants, and the jumjum that spawns on the ground in Rivervale are al different jumjums.<br />

So - he'll probably be back after the patch.. You know, the patch where they change the quest. The people on the servers where he's been killed and who still haven't purchased a truckload of Rennet are kinda SoL if they were doing the quest for the &quot;old&quot; reward. :(</div></div><hr />

Star Ruby Encrusted Stein is trivial over 250.  If you aren't at least 220+ in pottery don't even bother, it will be luck if you get one made.

The robe does seem to be a problematic combine, however my fellow druid and I weren't too successful on the Misty Thicket Picnic either.  We had about five successes between us on about 50+ combine attempts.  We were both under trivial for this though - 187-190 area.<br />
<br />
Just adding a few notes for my observations so far:<br />
<br />
Halfling Gifts:<br />
Lotus Pie: The Sweet Lotus Sap and the Sticky Sap worked for me.  The sap makes only one paste, but the paste makes four pies on a successful combine.<br />
Picnic: Hard as heck - as I said above, about a 188ish skill, 40+ combines yielded about three successes.  However each success yielded four (I think) MTPs.<br />
Lucky Cabbage: No problem with 188 skill.<br />
<br />
Elvish Gifts:<br />
Demi-Sec: Was given to me by a friend.<br />
The bottle was easy to make with 191 jewelcraft skill.  The combine failed at 168 brewing (trivial is 250+).  The bottle is eaten upon an unsuccessful combine.<br />
Mistletoe Cutting Sickle: The various parts (blade, hilt, pommel) were all trivial and easy to make at 175 smithing.  I got *very* lucky and got a sickle to combine on my first try.  I failed two other combine attempts with extra parts I had.<br />
Golden Idol of Tunare - Dunno, bought this one too.<br />
<br />
Human Gifts:<br />
Blessed Fishing Pole: The spool was trivial at 175 smithing, and the tailoring was trivial at 158.  The pole was trivial at 191 fishing skill.<br />
Star Ruby Encrusted Stein:  No idea, bought this.<br />
Ceremonial Solstice Robe:  Pain in the @$$.  The good news is that the needle and the Gem Studded Chain *are* returned upon combine failure.  It's definately not trivial at 158 skill.  My current ratio is about 1:6.  The Gem Studded Chain seemed to go through streaks as well - a GM Jeweler friend of mine (250 skill) had a good run of 4:5, then bad runs of 1:5.  The Worked Silver chain was trivial at 191 jewelcraft and easy to make.</div></div><hr />

Can you trade in your Xanthe's Earring of Nature, to get the FT1 earring and then do the quest again to get a 2nd Xanthe's Earring of Nature - so in effect you would be wearing the Xanthe's Earring of Nature as well as the FT1 earring?<br />

<br />
If anyone knows if the gifts are tradeable please let me know, heh if not then everything I asked was useless. If not, then the people with high enough skills can make tons of cash for each gift. I know I would pay people for each one. <br />

anyways, let me know if these 9 gifts are tradeable or no drop. I haven't really looked into this quest to much. Thanks<br />

<br />
COSTS<br />
My current guesstimate is about 3.5K in Store Bought materials, 15K if you buy all the finished products from tradeskillers. The costs below only include Store Bought Components, it assumes you've foraged and farmed anything that is foragable and farmable (except gems). It also assumes NO fees for enchanter services and subcomponent pottery combines etc.<br />
The absolute minimum cost, assuming bought gems, is about 2.5K with no failures anywhere. If all the gems are farmed (good luck), the minimum can drop to below 1K.<br />
<br />
Here's some notes:<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Elves - Demi-Sec Champagne<br />
A 250 brewer has a 95% success rate. Cost of materials per champagne is about 35pp<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Elves - Mistletoe Cutting Sickle<br />
A smith with effective 255 skill seems to succeed 1 in 3 (based on 24 combines, 8 successes). Often 1 subcombine failure in the attempts. This works out to a raw cost in materials of about 1200pp for a success.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Elves - Golden Idol of Tunare<br />
Trivial at 242 pottery skill, success rate at 250 pottery a little better than 50%. Cost per attempt about 225pp, but be prepared to provide 3 sets of components, or just pay the potter 2-4K for a finished idol (market price depends on server). 200 skill potters have about 15% success rate.<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Man - Blessed Fishing Pole<br />
Raw cost per attempt is about 175pp. Not a lot of data on this. Guessing about 50% success rate for a 200 skill fisher.<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Man - Star Ruby Stein<br />
Raw cost per attempt is about 75pp. At 250 pottery skill success rate is about 50%. Be prepared with 3 sets of components or just pay the potter 1-4K for a finished stein (market price depends on the server). 200 skill potters have about 10% success rate.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Man - Ceremonial Solstice Robe<br />
About 300pp for first attempt, 40pp per attempt thereafter. Could get really expensive since there are not a lot of 250 tailors out there. Guessing about 1K average for a 200 tailor. I've heard of a 232 tailor charging 1K for success if you bring components.<br />
<br />
1st Gift of Halflings - Lotus Pie<br />
Raw cost per attempt is low (50pp?). I've seen people selling finished Pies for 500-1K, seems to be standard on our server.<br />
<br />
2nd Gift of Halflings - Misty Thicket Picnic<br />
Raw cost per attempt a few pp (approx). I've seen finished ones sell for 500pp-1K.<br />
<br />
3rd Gift of Halflings - Lucky Cabbage<br />
Raw cost per attempt &lt; 10pp.<br />
<br />
So the conclusion is... farm and forage everything, pay the cost of gems and other store bought materials, find 250 skill tradeskillers for each item, and you should be able to get away with about 3.5K average cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3.5kpp average cost and time spent farming the components.... That's not that much if you think about it, especially for such an earring. And you don't need to try to motivate your guild to help you with a raid.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds tend to have 250 jewelcraft people who will do combine for free, but not necessarily so with other tradeskills, especially smithing and tailoring.

Also, people on The Tribunal are charging 1500pp to hit the combine button, this is on a success with you having the materials.<br />

I thought that was a bit steep.  <br />

I had a 232 tailor fail 20 out of 21 robes for me this weekend and after all that failing, I ended up paying 2kpp for the stein and ultimately my new earring.<br />

While I disagree about the ease of the quest for the average tradeskiller, several people across servers (including me) are taking advantage of this.<br />
<br />
I charge 5k per successful robe combine on Rodcet Nife (or bring me stuff I need for the quest). Some people will bring a stack of laquered star rubies (I hate running around if I don't have to). Others trade me a sickle for a successful robe.<br />
<br />
I have heard of people selling POTC &quot;kits&quot; for as much as 100k pp. I have sold one for 80k on Rodcet. The guy even asked what the quest was and asked for a link.

1k on the hard combines with success and you bring the materials.<br />

100k would have paid for me to raise all my tradeskills on all my characters to 175+ and then I could have bought a Lodizal shield after that with the extra.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt be too shocked if they made the final combines nodrop, or they pulled the second earring completely. Thats one reason I busted all weekend to get the FT1 done. If they pull Rebecca as was hinted already we can still do earring #1 if the supplys are available, but then they would have to make PotC available another way or just remove her last sentence about the earring I guess...</div></div><hr />

My particularly speciality is robes and I was offering to swap robes for sickles, misty picnics etc.  I also have offered to combine any robes on my server (Bristlebane) for free.

Most of the contents of the text below the spoiler and in the spoiler itself are simply quotes and answers. This reflects the community effort that helped the DG make this quest easy.  If at the end, we provided alternatives for people who lacked the skills but had a big account, that is good. If we provided the incentives to work on your skills, we even accomplished a loftier goal.  There are different ways to skin a cat and there are different ways to have fun or find a sense of accomplishment in this game.  As far as I am concerned, people are free to choose the way that suits their needs the best.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

I was there the other day, and tons were dropping. Since it seems as though many other places have had the drop rate decline, I thought I would mention this location.  Also, I was in Steamfont this weekend, and all of the ground spawns that used to have either iron or russet oxide are now not there.  Right in front of the mino caves, are 2 large pieces of scap metal, the one on the right(when facing the mino cave) used to have a static oxide spawn on the top of it, which is no longer there.  I also checked the other spawn locations that I used to get the oxides from, and the entire weekend of looking yeilded nothing.  Hope this helps.<br />

I can't help but press forage.  Go raid WW or ToV and get the eggs.  Spend a night in PoG and the karanas.  Kill a load of spiders or pay someone to do it for you.  Gather a load of ore in Steam or elsewhere.  I'm working on trading for my earrings with a very nice tradesman.  I'd think if you offer them enough supplies for the both of you, that you would be able to get your combines done.<br />

This is a social quest.  I hated it at first and now all I have to say is that I take every bad thing I said about it back.  I love it.<br />

<br />
If you buy them all separatly you can get them cheaper on Fennin but people are lazy and liek the fact they can get it all at once and be done.<br />
<br />
I am about finished with set #9 or 10, I have lost count and will sell it probably and be done for good.<br />
<br />
I have been selling a ton of pies, champagne and picnics though. Its nice because I want to be a GM baker anyway so making some cash along the way has been a very cool bonus.<br />
<br />
Someone posted that they were seeing 75k for the sets on their server. Due to the stats of the earring I can see that, but due to the cost of each piece individually thats insane lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miss Foxfyre</div><div class="date">06-25-2002, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">75k -- that's frickin' ridiculous!<br />
<br />
Here's a quick rundown of what prices are out there on my server:<br />
picnic 500pp<br />
pie 500pp<br />
champagne 500pp<br />
idol 2,000pp<br />
sickle 3,000-5,000pp<br />
robe 3,000-5,000pp<br />
pole 1,000-3,000pp<br />
stein 2,000-3,000pp<br />
cabbage 200-500pp<br />
<br />
On a bad day you would spend 15kpp on gifts. Some have been selling the entire package for 35kpp, but I doubt they get many buyers since the individual gifts' total price is less than half that. Any retail markup is understandable if the quester has zero involvement in the quest and just wants the quick bang for the buck, but 35kpp is already ridiculous.<br />
<br />
One of the more popular sellers of idols has made over 20,000pp in a short time, and he doesn't even sell all day every day. I imagine makers of robes and sickles are getting much more for their finished products. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of tonight, I have 2 of the picnic, cabbage, and pie, 1 stein, and 5kpp in the bank.  And I bought RotG for 3400pp, and 6 of the Geerlock devices (all but brewing, already had that one) for 3250pp in the last two nights.  Have two Blessed poles on me and most of the components to make 8 more.<br />
<br />
Good news: Boy am I glad I raised fishing to 200 in my younger days, when I did my &quot;casting parties&quot; to raise casting skills.<br />
<br />
Bad news: Wish I had realized earlier than last week that there was something I could do tradeskill-wise to help do the quest and make some money.  I was avoiding the quest cause I thought I'd have to come up with all the cash for the gifts, and I'm always broke.<br />
<br />
On 7th Hammer, if you just pay standard asking prices for the gifts, it's about 12-13kpp per set.  Haven't really seen anyone charging extra for &quot;full kits&quot;, even though there are some guys selling all the different gifts.<br />

There is an SK in my guild who has worked on her baking for a long time -- even though a lot of us poked a little fun at her. :)  She began making picnics before the quest to continue skilling up, and once the market hit for POTC she began auctioning the picnics, pies, and occasional cabbage.<br />
<br />
When she was done after about 4 days of skilling and selling, she had raised her skill to 202 and was 60kpp richer.<br />
<br />
We don't make fun of her anymore. :p <br />
<br />
After starting with 0pp in the bank and no earrings, thanks to some time spent getting my fishing up, now I have two earrings and 8kpp back in the bank. (I'd say I spent 8-9kpp on both earrings combined.) Just ran out of velium for the poles but I still get asked about them frequently. As much stress as it was running around to get everything, I really enjoyed getting to know the other tradeskillers on the server! Overall, a very enjoyable quest for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When the FT 1 earring craze hit, I started offering Robe trades.  One robe for a gemmed chain and 40 sacred tunarean silks (about 13 combines), which gave me enough to make the next robe (on average...sometimes I had a longer string of failures).  A pretty good deal for the person with the components since I absorbed all combine failure risk.<br />
<br />
However, there are a lot of people allergic to silk farming and making CEs, it seems, as I kept getting requests to buy the robes for plat.  I resisted, because I was basically working from robe to robe, and tried to set the price high enough to discourage plat buyers.  My asking price per robe jumped from 5K to 10K to 12K to 15K in a matter of a day or two.   The highest price per robe at the height of the frenzy was 20K.  <br />
<br />
I wasn't out to make more plat since I already was into six figures, and I really didn't want to sell the robes.  But when folks came up with the asking price, a deal's a deal.  So I added another 100K to my bank (although most folks have done the trades, which I have continued to offer...in fact, I've lowered the STS requirement to a single stack, since my success rate is so high).<br />
<br />
I did only one complete set trade, and that was before the FT 1 earring was introduced.  I traded the 9 gifts for Mask of the Stalker...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah those prices are about the same as Fennin.<br />
<br />
I do get more for the champagne, picnics and pies than that on average 750p each, but 2 for 1000p. I still make those 3 items and will until I am maxed on skills/trivials.<br />
<br />
I have sold out all my extra items finally, but 1 sickle and some gem studded chains I will probably have made into robes again or just give to guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quigsby</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious what people are seeing for Sickles and Cabbages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miss Foxfyre</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have seen three or four smiths selling sickles for 3k-5k, and I even saw one selling a sickle for like 1.5kpp, which I thought was low! LOL. Cabbages seem to go for less than 500pp--way less if you consider how easy it is to get wild cabbages. <br />
<br />
I've had a little bit of luck playing the middle market in the quest. While the top-end tradeskillers get the most money, I have done interim combines and also sold a lot of imbued emeralds, permafrost crystals, plains pebbles, cabbages, and other random items both questers and tradeskillers need to continue making items -- it's stuff people would usually hate to farm, including myself.<br />
<br />
My experience has been mostly positive (80%) with this quest, but there have been a few times when players were greedy and very ugly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild pooled money, items, and trade skills to get 30 copies of this earring.  2 for each druid, and 1 for each other participant.  <br />
<br />
The people leading this effort required 1,500 pp per earring and asked for assistance in gathering items (but not required).  So far, we have 8 of the 9 gifts done for everyone, and the last one just needs a few combines.  The druid's, including myself, contribution was primarily foraging, especially those horrid planar oak branches.  <br />
<br />
At this point, the people leading this effort in my guild are even expecting to return some cash to those participating.<br />
<br />
Turnaround time for this effort has been about 2 weeks, which I don't think is bad at all.  Plus it is an effort that promotes strong teamwork in your guild, without any fights over &quot;uber&quot; loot.<br />

We're about midway through getting 15 kits together, most of us were dead broke to begin with so we focussed on the items that required more time and less money and have been trading / selling those for the items we couldn't afford.<br />
<br />
Its working well for us and I must say we're all having a blast doing it..  its rather nice to keep logging in to the same group of people all working hard at a common goal like that, I think this quest is actually teaching us all a little something about teamwork :)<br />
