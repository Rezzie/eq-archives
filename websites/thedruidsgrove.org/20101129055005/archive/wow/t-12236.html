In 3v3 arena.<br />
<br />
My team = feral druid, resto druid, arms warrior.<br />
<br />
Who to kill first?<br />
Hitting the warrior gives him rage..<br />
Hitting the frost mage just makes him iceblock..<br />
Hitting the paladin just makes him bubble.<br />
<br />
And at any time the paladin can use blessing of protection on whoever we are nuking.<br />
What to do? :S<br />

<br />
Cyclone/Feral Charge/Bash/Maim repeat.<br />
<br />
Then you can have the Resto and Warrior take out the Mage or at least make him waste his Iceblock so then you can take him out. The Resto Druid should be able to go Bear when the Warrior zooms in on him, as long as he tosses some HoTs on himself he should be ok.<br />
<br />
Then take Warrior and finally the Pally.<br />
<br />
At least that's what I would try doing.</div></div><hr />

As the feral druid your job should be to dps the focus target but throw out extra Cyclones on targets as well as FC/Bash/Maim.<br />
<br />
You could do what Kauroth said and try to take down the Mage but when he Iceblocks, try to CC the pally so he cannot heal their mage (and if you're lucky he'll blow his shield and after that its usually GG)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Of course, while you're slapping the pally the mage just nukes you.  =/<br />
 <br />
So I don't know.  You probably shouldn't listen to me.  :O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-04-2007, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Resto druid vs. Arms warrior = GG. <br />
<br />
1. Cyclone him twice as soon as you see him (preferably before he can charge you).<br />
2. Root him. This will probably be easiest to hit him with nature's grasp first (after he does his charge/intercept stun) and get away from him. While his charge/intercept is on cooldown, CCing him shouldn't be too bad. After 3 roots, try cycloning him again. Hopefully by then the mage will be down. The trick will be to heal through the mage/warrior tricks while CCing the warrior and trying to put any damage you can on the mage (moonfire will probably be about it).<br />
<br />
Now, this is assuming that the warrior can root the mage somehow. A combination of talent-proc hamstring and intercept is about all he's got. More than likely, the mage will just kite the warrior without you rooting the mage. <br />
<br />
The mage with his blink + trinket + iceblock will probably burn through the diminishing returns on your roots super fast, so hopefully you won't have to wait to root the warrior while the mage is being rooted. <br />
<br />
if your resto druid is specced like me (feral charge and brutal impact, but the rest resto, basically) and is real good, you could have both of the druids CCing the pally. Basically if the feral druid says &quot;i'm CC'd&quot; or &quot;I'm out of stuns&quot; the resto druid shifts to bear, feral charges, brutal impact bash, while the feral druid heals the warrior. Should only be for a few seconds, but it something to consider. might get you away from the arms warrior for a second too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We started by trying to kill the paladin, but he was far too.. eh... resilient. :P  So we switched to the mage, who iceblocked, then received a blessing of protection.  Eventually I went oom, and the resto druid went oom shortly afterwards, and we died.<br />
<br />
The resto druid has nature's grasp, but no charge.  We are all good players and the resto druid can easily handle 1 arms warrior on him.  2 is asking a lot but I've seen him do it before without problems.<br />
I'm wondering if we should have just focused on the mage to start with, all our dps is physical so mayhaps focusing on cloth is a better plan.  With the huge damage spikes involved with bloodmoon MS, and cat bites, there's even a chance we'll kill him before he has a chance to iceblock.<br />
<br />
It was a really hard team though :&lt;<br />
Thanks for the advice druids :&gt;<br />
We went back in last night and won 4 games, only lost 1.  So our final score for the first week of our new team's existence is 5-5.  Could be worse I guess..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-05-2007, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. My 2v2 and 3v3 teams finished slightly ahead and my 5v5 finished slightly behind last week. Hopefully this week will be better. Our warlock went from a decent 170ish resilience to nearly 300. I'm hoping to take mine from 150ish (resto) to 200ish. It's amazing how much resilience plays a part.<br />
<br />
In general, with a team with almost all physical attacks, I'd agree: Clothies first, leather next, mail, then plate then anything with a shield last, unless it's a healer who's gear doesn't look real good. A good team (in my limited experience) has more luck CCing a heavy healer than killing him if the teams are evenly matched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">12-06-2007, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would also recommend killing the mage first.<br />
if he's deep frost he will survive long but with a feral druid and a MS-Warri on him he will blow his 2 ice blocks in the first 1-2 mins.<br />
Then he's out in 3-5 secs if u can get to him which is no probs for a Warri-Druid-Combo (Charge, Bash -&gt; if blink intercept etc.)<br />
end the resto druid has normaly no problem with 1 arms warri.<br />
Root the warri Cyclone the Pala in the situations u are on the mage and gg</div></div><hr />
