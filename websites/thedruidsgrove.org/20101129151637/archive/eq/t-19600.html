Seize all that they own in the US.  And even offshore.<br />
<br />
Everything.  Oil platforms.  Gas Stations.  Their refineries.  Seize all the shares.  All of their land.  All of their rights.<br />
<br />
Every vehicle, every uniform, every everything.  Seize it by force.<br />
<br />
This is unspeakable what they have done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And you wanna know why?  Because their strategy always has not been to stop the spill.  But to reclaim the drillsite.  To reclaim the oil.  Not to stop the spill.<br />
<br />
Seize it all NOW!<br />
<br />
If this were an enemy attack on us, it would not be worse.  We need to address it that way.</div></div><hr />

Ultimately it is not an attack but criminal neglect. You normally do not treat somebody as hostile armies for that. You do however make them pay, as far as they are capable, for the damage they caused.<br />
Second, how long do you think it will take for the -other- oil companies to quietly but hurriedly withdraw their assets from the USA if your government does as you want? They are all in the same position with drilling oil in difficult and potentially catastrophical circumstances. This accident happened to BP, but it could have been any of the others as well, and given time it -will- happen to all of them. The kind of drilling they are doing is just that shade short of impossible nowadays. And of course you are not really expecting BP to take this seizing of their assets laying down do you? They will figure that if they are going to lose everything anywat they might as well tie the government up in courts for all that they are worth.<br />
Third, what about the utter morons who decided that the government should not be involved in supervision of dangerous activities at all and that the companies doing the dangerous things are the ones who should decide if, how and when their activities are subject to oversight? It is no different really from cutting down on funding and authority of the DFA to the point that they are required to accept studies by pharmaceutical companies that 'prove' that their new medicines are safe and then being surprised that all kinds of debilitating and even outright lethal side effects crop up that have been glossed over in the 'research' because the persons doing the study was under orders to not discover anything that might affect the bottom line of his employer.<br />
<br />
That is not to say that what BP did was not wrong, but we have to be honest with ourselves and admit that we all got into this mess together, and playing the blame (and litigation) game is not going to make any changes when it comes to preventing such disasters in the future.<br />

<br />
And their you summarised the entire dilemma in one line.<br />
<br />
Any administration that allows the gas price at the pump to rise sharply is going to be voted out of office at the first opportunity by people who all agree with the principle of the thing but vote for their own wallet when push comes to shove. Obama saw that with Bush and I do not think he is going to repeat that mistake if he can avoid it.<br />
<br />
Ultimately the people of the USA (to begin with, but the rest of the western world to follow closely) will have to start to travel less, consume less and switch off the airconditioning. It is the only way we can keep on importing cheap Chinese products for a few decades longer.<br />

The company verbally agrees to clean up any environmental mess they make, regulations requiring they actually put any money up front to deal with cleaning up were gutted by Republicans.  Then they mine it.  The board votes themselves a big bonus.  The company goes bankrupt and the state and federal government are left with having to pay for the cleanup of heavy metals from the water supply, which basically means for forever.<br />
<br />
The oil companies are actually much better behaved than other mining operations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">06-17-2010, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Random tidbit - most gas companies don't own the actual gas stations, they're normally franchises. In fact in many states, the gas station doesn't have to buy gas from their &quot;named&quot; brand - they can get gas from whomever they want to and not tell the consumer (which makes you wonder if all those engine additives are actually included in your Shell and Chevron gas, doesn't it?). Not only that, but many oil companies are looking to get out of the gas station gig entirely as, according to them, the profit margin is too slim.<br />
<br />
So when those people were boycotting the BP stations on TV they were just hurting the schmoe who owned the station. BP probably doesn't even know the guy exists.</div></div><hr />

If you actually see a gas station getting filled, sometimes it'll be a &quot;branded&quot; truck, other times it may be just a random non-marked truck. Most self-owned gas stations are like any other business, they buy their product from whoever can give them the best price. They have to pass their octane rating, but other than that, the gas can be a blend from several different sources.<br />

3. &#8220;My gas isn&#8217;t better for your car; it&#8217;s just more expensive.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Oil companies spend lots of money explaining why their gas is better than the competition&#8217;s. Chevron&#8217;s gas, for example, is fortified with &#8220;Techron,&#8221; and Amoco Ultimate is supposed to save the planet along with your engine. But today more than ever, one gallon of gas is as good as the next.<br />
<br />
True, additives help to clean your engine, but what the companies don&#8217;t tell you is that all gas has them. Since 1994 the government has required that detergents be added to all gasoline to help prevent fuel injectors from clogging. State and local regulators keep a close watch to make sure those standards are met; a 2005 study indicated that Florida inspectors checked 45,000 samples to ensure the state&#8217;s gas supply was up to snuff, and 99 percent of the time it was. &#8220;There&#8217;s little difference between brand-name gas and any other,&#8221; says AAA spokesperson Geoff Sundstrom.<br />
<br />
What&#8217;s more, your local Chevron station may sell gas refined by Shell or Exxon Mobil. Suppliers share pipelines, so they all use the same fuel. And the difference between the most expensive brand-name gas and the lowliest gallon of no-brand fuel? Often just a quart of detergent added to an 8,000-gallon tanker truck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A computer that monitored drilling operations on the Deepwater Horizon had been freezing with a &quot;blue screen of death&quot; prior to the explosion that sank the oil rig last April, the chief electrician aboard testified Friday at a federal hearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blue screen of death,&quot; or BSOD, is a term most often used to describe the display shown by Microsoft Windows after a serious crash that has incapacitated a PC.<br />
<br />
In his testimony Friday, Michael Williams, the chief electronics technician aboard the Transocean-owned Deepwater Horizon, said that the rig's safety alarm had been habitually switched to a bypass mode to avoid waking up the crew with middle-of-the-night warnings.<br />
<br />
Williams said that a computer control system in the drill shack would still record high gas levels or a fire, but it would not trigger warning sirens, according to numerous reports, including stories published by the New York Times and New Orleans' largest daily, the Times-Picayune .<br />
<br />
Williams, who has filed a multi-million dollar federal lawsuit against Transocean, also said that five weeks before the April 20 explosion, he had been called to check a computer system that monitored and controlled drilling.<br />
<br />
The machine had been locking up for months, Williams said, producing what he and others on the crew called a &quot;blue screen of death.&quot; &quot;It would just turn blue. You'd have no data coming through,&quot; Williams said today, according to the New York Times' story.<br />
<br />
With the computer frozen, the driller would not have access to crucial data about what was going on in the well.Microsoft is a pretty deep pocket, so according to American legal tradition they should be held responsible regardless of the level of fault.</div></div><hr />

This makes them look even stupider.  If they knew there was a problem for months and didn't fix it then that displays a spectacular degree of negligence.   It's not like replacing a computer is prohibitively expensive in the scheme of things.  If it was a software problem they could have had someone from Microsoft fly out and troubleshoot it.<br />
<br />
What a bunch of incompetent putzes.</div></div><hr />
