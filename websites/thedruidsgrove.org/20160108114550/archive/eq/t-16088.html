I was looking at some of the areas people hunt and I saw several say the nest is good for solo.  I was looking to go there in the hopes of getting some glossy drake hides for halfling cultural.  I have been back about a month so I went pretty quickly through levels in the TSS zones.  I just dinged 75 and I am looking to upgrade gear via gathering parts I need for tradeskill items.<br />
 <br />
Any help in regards to how and where the nest is would be greatly appreciated.  It seems when I was doing some searching around here that there may be an instanced as well as a static zone.<br />
 <br />
Also thanks so much for the posts on the icefall bracers very nice quest upgrades in the wrist area.<br />
 <br />
Great to be back and thanks in advance for your help and advice.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Should be some posts here about it -<br />
