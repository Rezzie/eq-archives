But either way, I would like opinions on my spec. I know my gear will change quickly. I will ditch the 1 pt in thick hide and Imotw<br />
Should I toss them into Heart of the wild? <br />
<br />
I also want to thank everyone here. Ive been lurking here for about 2 months now. It has really helped me be a better druid. <br />
<br />
One last thing, my tanking skills are weak. I was thinking about doing solo runs thru instances in bear to help this. At level 58-60 what would give me a challenge with out endless ghost runs. <br />

Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

They'll help you learn how to solo. You need to learn how to tank by tanking actual instances.<br />
<br />
By the time you're 60 you should have enough decent outlands gear and upgrades that you can attempt ramparts. It's a good  instance with interesting pulls, some good fights and a need to prioritize things. It is great for learning how to tank. I would do it with friends and people you know, and make sure they know you need practice. And then go practice.<br />
<br />
Another thing to do is to go on runs with someone else who is a good tank and watch what they do. Watch how they mark, how they pull, which mobs they hit first, which they CC, etc. <br />
<br />
But really, you just have to practice.<br />
<br />
As to what your talents should be - you should max thick hide. It's one of the best advantages a druid tank has. It's a huge talent. You should take a point out of improved motw. Maxing heart of the wild is good. After that, go for naturalist and then omen of clarity. After that it really depends; I went with Intensity, some people go with primal tenacity, others natural shapeshifter. I think it really depends on how often you're going to be tanking vs. how often you'll be a cat.<br />
<br />
But heart of the wild and thick hide are the top needs. Get them. Then naturalist and omen of clarity.</div></div><hr />

Looks like you are on the right track for gear as well, and you will pick up some nice items from quests in the outlands. I found the outlands pretty hard to begin with at level 58, but you level quickly and once you reach 60 and get a few quest items it's a breeze.</div></div><hr />

Then go back make a few runs in BF, RP, SP and UB until you feel a bit more &quot;ready&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">03-12-2008, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes definitely get Heart of the Wild 5/5.<br />
<br />
You should also consider aiming to get Naturalist and Omen of Clarity in the Restoration tree.<br />

I couldn't disagree more. Learning how to position, how to use swipe and mangle and faerie fire, how to grab more than three mobs, how to CC and what to CC - these are important skills. Just because you won't be able to tank bosses as effectively doesn't mean you can't do the rest of the stuff. And frankly, bosses are cake for druids. It's multimobs and managing threat/CC on them that's the harder skill to learn and the one that you need the most practice on to get good at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a look under the feral section.  There are some great tanking threads.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />

<br />
I know that you don't have lacerate yet, but there are some good pointers in there about tanking without it.  It covers stats, gear, technique, and...well...pretty much everything.  <br />
<br />
Plus, if there's anything else you'd like to ask, odds are you'll have a response by day's end. ;)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the tips. <br />
I was told last nite that my guild is going to start a second kara group. So I will be tanking more then I hoped. I guess I gotta learn how to be a better tank now.</div></div><hr />
