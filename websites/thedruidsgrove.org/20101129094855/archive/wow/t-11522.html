Awesome compilation of powerleveling professions (all of them). The guide was put together by Highlander (EU-Terenas). It even has parts now for leveling professions from 300-375 for TBC.<br />

Try this guide (http://www.almostgaming.com/wowguides/wow-fishing-and-cooking-guide) to level your fishing and cooking together. It really helped me.</div></div><hr />

Turn ambiance and music down 100%.  Watch movie, fish by ear.  :biggrin: WHAMO! High fishing skill.</div></div><hr />

I get on my wife's laptop while I watch football games and bring my skill up that way. But my favorite trick is to fish while waiting in queue for arena or BGs. Personally I teleport to Moonglade, jump down to Lake Elune'ara and catch redgill which, for some strange reason, sell reasonably well on the AH. If your skill's not high enough for Moonglade yet, take the Shatt port to Darnassus and run right outside the Temple to catch low level fish until your level is high enough for Moonglade. Darnassus is easiest to get to the water. Once your queue is up, go to the BG or arena and you end up back in Shatt when it's over. Even if you only catch 3-4 fish, it's a skill level every 2-3 times and it beats standing around the battlemaster dancing.</div></div><hr />

Or raids. That's how I got mine up. 300 - 375, without a problem, all done when raid was initially forming. I just stayed at a lake/pond and fished until raid was almost completed. Then I would buy camp fire stuff and get a port to the zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">12-15-2007, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fishing is signficantly different from most professions in the manner in which it allows players to gain skill points. Fishing in a more difficult area does not increase the chance of gaining a skill points from each fish caught. The chance of catching a fish on a specific cast increases with your skill level (and decreases with the difficulty of the area you're fishing in) - it is, therefore, possible to level fishing to maximum skill without leaving the pond you began fishing in. Gradually increasing the difficulty of where you fish is desirable, however, as this allows you to catch better fish to level Cooking with.<br />
The amount of fish caught to gain a fishing skill point increases as your fishing skill increases - for 0-100, catching a single fish usually earns you a skill point, while at 300+ skill, more than 10 are typically required. The following equation gives a rough estimate:<br />
(Current Fishing Skill - 75) / 25 = Rough number of successful catches for a skill-upHmm. That has some interesting implications.  Basically, I should stop fishing the high level zones, go catch fish in a low level zone to raise my skill, then go back for the good stuff when I'll have a much lower miss rate.<br />
<br />
For some reason, that just seems counter-intuitive.  But, the formula for fish caught/skill point seems accurate, at Lvl 344 it takes me usually 10 or 11 fish to gain a point, and the formula predicts 10.76 fish/point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is EXACTLY how it works, and while it seems counter-intuitive, it actually lets you do some great stuff (like port to Darn, SW or IF between arenas) to get your level up as high as you'd like. But there is some incentive to fish the higher level places- higher level fish (and the buffed foods you create with them) are more valuable and sell better. Golden Fishsticks (44 +healing) is a great example. At 344 you can catch them at the lake just outside Shatt and sell them for a good price (or better, send them to your Holy priest alt like me). Once you can catch and cook Spicy Crawdads (+30 stam), they sell really well too.<br />
<br />
I know fishing seems boring, and I didn't level it up until a few months ago. But at 70 it's really easy to do during the down time that's inherent in the game and it's great having all the buffed food you could ever want for you, your alts and your guild. A buddy of mine started leveling cooking the same time as me, but neglected fishing. He was ALWAYS asking me to send him the fish I didn't need for easy cooking skillups, and is now going back and doing it separately. Trust me, they're worth doing together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Briarthorn is an issue on the servers I've played on. Getting 80 - even when going herbal yourself and picking it up as you level - is tricky. I spammed trade at level 65 promising upwards of 10g per stack and still it never appeared in the AH in sufficient quantity for powerlevelling.<br />
<br />
Still, this guide requires less briarthorn than the one I was using at the time. (I needed something like 150 briarthorn for that one.) So there's that. Maybe I should try to write one up that doesn't require much briarthorn, or even any at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being an Alchemist myself who has used this guide, it's a bit tricky for certain materials such as Briarthorn. Iirc, I used the Herbalism Powerleveling Guide (in the link) to look for good routes for Briarthorn and farmed it in a couple hours (buying some as well). Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">12-24-2007, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Historically I worked around the problem by making pots that didn't require briarthorn. They were allegedly more expensive, but it didn't matter, as it was possible to make them, and impossible to brew the others. Was thinking about articulating it in a powerlevel guide.</div></div><hr />
