Also, if you could post your reasons behind your choices that'd be awesome, trying to figure out what kind of armor to work towards.<br />
<br />
*edit* Forgot to show in Thread topic that this is meant for feral build armor options, obviously :)<br />
*edit again*  Please move this to the Polls area, I completely forgot it was there, sorry =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
plus with your build I am sure there are talents granting you a bonus in attack so the extra int imo helps for those times you are needed to heal out of feral form. But if possible try for a little mix of both, you don't have to just settle for 1 type on enhancement on your armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrigar</div><div class="date">01-11-2006, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about situations where you have armor A that adds str,agi, stam or whatever and you have armor B that adds +% chance to whatever.  Which would you choose?  I only ask because at lower lvls, you dont get many things that add both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If all you ever did was damage and were never called on to heal (when would that happen?) then maybe +crit would be valid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidrian</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here are my thoughts..<br />
<br />
before lvl 40 even if u wanted to focus on crit %+ and dodge %+ there are not a lot of options. even blue armor pre 40 does not offer much in that field. now once you start getting into the 50's u'll be seeing a lot more of those crit %+ and what not. while they are nice, its not wise in my opinion to sacrifice your other stats for that. the ideal armor is that which boosts both stats and %. even if its minor in some cases. an excellent example is the tombstone breastplate (which im using for my cat). gives +4 strength +10 stamina +6 spirit AND +2% crit. godly in my opinion.<br />
<br />
so my vote is definately for the mix of stats and % and if u cannot find a piece with both then i would go with stats.<br />
<br />
also here is a REALLY good website to check out for high end gear (for those who do not have an MC/ZG/BWL guild).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bullsi</div><div class="date">08-28-2006, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">first off, i assume this poll means at level 60, as im sure almost everyones answeres would change at varying levels.<br />
for a healer/caster my priorities are:<br />
+mana regernation<br />
+healing/damage<br />
then stats:<br />
Spirit<br />
Intelect<br />
Stamina<br />
<br />
For Feral my priorities are:<br />
+% to hit<br />
+% to crit<br />
then stats:<br />
Agility<br />
Stamina<br />
Strength</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like mp5 / +healing in caster/healer. my int etc are ok i think with around 7.7k mana buffed for a raid.<br />
<br />
feral i look for AC / Sta with some dodge if possible in bear and some crit / agi is always nice for kitty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-21-2006, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mix and Match ftw.  Sure, you can get an uber crit rating, but what's your attack power?<br />
<br />
Yeah, you have 10k health, but your ac is. . .  .8k?!?<br />
<br />
So you got 30% dodge. . .  but only 5k health.<br />
<br />
Those are all other druids trying to explain to me why they are better tanks or cat druids.  I gotta say, hands down, that if you don't balance  the stats with the bonuses, you're gonna come up short in the end.  You need a healthy dose of all of them.  Now, are there differences between your cat suit and your bear suit?  I can only hope so.  You want to crit in bear, sure, but it's more important to stay alive.  Dead bears hold no aggro!  So maybe a +dodge here is better.  Or sacrifice some +attack power for some agi.<br />
<br />
The nice think about stats is that they can do multiple things.  Agi will let you crit, dodge, and increase your armor by like .000000001% (rofl).  So look at the conversions before taking this piece over that piece.  Learn your classes stat conversions.  What is 1% crit in cat?  How much agi does it take to get a dodge %?  What's the str -&gt; attack power conversion?<br />
<br />
These are all questions you should be able to answer.  Like it or not, this game is built on math.  So if you do the math, you can answer your own questions about gear most of the time.  <br />
<br />
At this point, I redirect you to the druid forums of WoW for some EXCELLENT guides on the questions I jsut posed.</div></div><hr />
