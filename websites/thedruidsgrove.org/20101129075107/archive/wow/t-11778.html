Any suggestions on where I should go next for good leveling possibilities?  With an Inn?</div></div><hr />

There is a very nice and easy set of circuits you can do in each of those locations, but you can't do straight through in any one.  You have to skip around a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried to get to Feralas from there, but ended up running in dangerous circles.  Whats the best route to Feralas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theramore (or Ratchet), head to the Great Lift (Thousand Needles), follow the road to the West, Feralas is right there (&quot;city&quot; right on the Outskirts, too). Alternatively, you could try Desolace -&gt; Feralas (at least, I've heard of it), but I actually never went that way. o.O It's one of the few spots I have yet to investigate.<br />
<br />
Edit: Er, that's if you're Alliance. If Horde, same deal, really. Ratchet or Crossroads instead of Theramore.</div></div><hr />

Follow the road to the north to get to Thousand Needles. Cross the plains and exit them north west. Then simply follow the road until you get to Feralas.<br />

A good place to find such information is http://mapwow.com/<br />
There you get a Google Earth-like map of Azeroth/Outlands made up of screenshots of the minimap.</div></div><hr />
