I tried to get a 5-man run together.  So, I posted &quot;LFG3M need healz and DPS&quot; in guild chat.  Whoa!  Several guildies told me that was &quot;rude&quot; and &quot;not respectful&quot; and that LFG is to be used in public lists only.  Not guild chat.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I was told that I really should use &quot;/whisper&quot; to gather up a group and not ask in guild chat.<br />
<br />
Here's the part that really shocked me...<br />
<br />
The GL (and many others in that guild) of my old guild felt the same way (though they tolerated it a bit).<br />
<br />
Any one understand why?  I just don't understand what is so bad about &quot;LFG...&quot; or making a guild request vs tells?<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Anyone else run into this sort of thing?  Maybe I'm just a MMO heathen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't miss them.... such a reaction is pretty stupid IMO...<br />
<br />
I always ask like: &quot;need 2 DD and 1 heal for H:UK, someone wants to come?&quot; or something like that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
guild chat should surely be used for anything to do with the guild !  and if you want to get some guildies together for a 5 man etc then why the heck can't you ask for people interested in running on /g ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">03-30-2009, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here's the reasons I have heard from both my guilds now..<br />
<br />
They like whispers over gchat broadcasts because it is more personable.  &quot;Less distracting&quot; (not that anything else is even going on in gchat, as it is mostly a GY).  If you whisper invite someone, it lets them know you really want them to come.<br />
<br />
I don't like whispers because it leads to groups/cliques within the guild (a big problem in larger guilds, I think which tends to annoy guild newcomers.).  &quot;I always ask Bob the rogue to dps&quot;.  Which, of course, means that &quot;Mary the Mage&quot; gets left out all the time.<br />
<br />
After talking with my brother (wow player as well), about the whole whisper vs gchat thing, he thinks that these folks don't like gchat invites because they then feel guilt'd into coming, where as a whisper invite is easy to dismiss as it is private?  &quot;Come on folks we only need one more DPS...&quot;<br />
<br />
I've even had one GL tell me that he didn't like hello/goodbye in gchat because if no one responds that person's feelings might get hurt.  So, we are better off not saying hello at all.<br />
<br />
In summary, both guilds &quot;dislike&quot; gchat 5-man help requests.  One really doesn't like the &quot;LFG&quot; usage within gchat.  My first guild actually wanted us to schedule all our 5-man runs (impromptu runs are a distraction and folks don't get hurt because they didn't get a run) and we should avoid &quot;hello/good night&quot; messages.<br />
<br />
I just find it odd that I have stumbled across the only 2 guilds that have similar behaviors.  Anyone else run into something similar?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you should transfer over to Crushridge. i could send you a g inv IMMEDIATELY, and i PROMISE i won't roll against you on the Origin of Nightmares! :P<br />

I sort of think it might be a control thing?  It definately was with the first guild.  I'm not sure if is with my current guild, as the don't seem to have the tight control sort of GL.  I often wonder if for my current guild the LFG stuff is more backlash against the whole &quot;733t l2p&quot; crap you get so often??  This horde guild is a former alliance guild that for whatever reason switched to horde (the old alliance guild still exists and is somewhat active on the same server).  I know the alliance folks tend to get more of that &quot;kid speak&quot; than the horde??  Who knows...srsly, our guild can always use another bear tank!Thanks for the offer.  Raid schedule and commitments play a huge role in guild selection as well.  Frankly, in my new guild I haven't tanked as they have plenty of pally tanks and a DK or 2.  That's fine, as I was kickin' butt with kitty DPS (I have crappy scraps of gear for kitty and I was at 9K AP, 45% crit, hit cap'd, raid buff'd [no scrolls or potions]).  I had to change my threat meter to warn me at 80% rather than 90% as I kept pulling threat (especially early in fights).  I can't imagine what will happen when my bleeds crit.  You can't stop that once you let them go...<br />
<br />
I also know that I'll pick up moonkin in 3.1 as they want more range dps rather than melee.</div></div><hr />

I like both the guilds (though I did leave my first guild after 3 years as they really starting treating by brother like dirt once they found out his toon was really his alt and that his main has all 25-man content on farm for the past month), I just didn't understand their policy.  So, I thought maybe it was &quot;normal&quot; or at the very least &quot;common&quot; and I just wasn't aware of it.</div></div><hr />

We have a few guildies in your brother's shoes, but we don't treat them badly AT ALL... my thoughts would be to look to them to explain fights to all the guys that are running through 25 Man content for the first time.<br />
<br />
We DO have a policy to raid with the guild, especially if it's Tuesday or Wednesday right after maintenance or Raid ID reset. There are very few things more infuriating as a guild officer to get a raid together on a Wednesday, to find out that some of our better DPS'ers are already saved from a run they PUG'd on Tuesday... grrrrrrrr</div></div><hr />

We have a few guildies in your brother's shoes,His main is on another server, so he never has raid id issues.  Though he might have date/time conflicts, but that doesn't happen often.  The problem I had with them was if he was reluctantly allowed to raid (because they needed healz/dps), his ideas or actions were always treated as some sort of personal attack.  I really think it was some sort of &quot;envy&quot;.  Who knows...we left and are better off now.  Though I do miss some of the people.  3 years is a long time to spend in one guild.  It was tough to leave.</div></div><hr />

Totally opposite from my guild.  In fact, we just had a minor schism where a handful of players left, in part because they were offended that some of the other officers would /w for groups, and not /g...  It may be a guild size thing, we're one of the largest on our server.  ~130 accounts IIRC.<br />
<br />
For the record, I don't think I've ever gotten a guild group going by /w.  <br />
Besides, the way I have my chat windows configured, it's easier for me to filter out /g tells if I'm not interested, than /w - I don't get many whispers, and they are usually important.<br />
<br />
Well, important to someone, anyway.</div></div><hr />

In fact, I left Wow for a few months because no would respond to /g invites (I was a hunter) yet I'd see multiple 5-man runs going on all the time.  I wasn't the only one that noticed and many left and still leave (IMO) for the same reason.<br />
<br />
While they tolerated /gchat invites, I was always told by many folks (mostly GL and their &quot;friends&quot;) that the practice was discouraged.  And the reasons never made any sense to me.<br />
<br />
The current guild is very small.  Maybe 10-15 &quot;active&quot; players.  Which is way the practice (discourage use of /gchat for invites) makes no sense to me at all...</div></div><hr />

<br />
having to use /w seems more elitist and would be used to target specific people rather than get involved in the guild as a whole and see who would like to come.<br />
<br />
when i did raid in a large guild we always used /g to say who wants to do some 5 mans.....no herocis in them days ;)<br />
<br />
nowi'm in a rather small guild we're always using /w cos asking people we know in big raid guilds !<br />
<br />
partly i'm glad RL does not let me raid. some people take this 'game' far to seriously.</div></div><hr />

Tlbj, that is just a silly policy.  Most guilds encourage using /g for grouping.  It gets you involved with new guildies, and quite frankly get folks who &quot;Need&quot; a run into the run they want.  /w gets your buddies in a run and most don't even need the content (in my experience).  <br />
<br />
Several guilds on our server go as far as saying that their members are not allowed to us the LFG, but instead required to fill from in house.  <br />
<br />
My guild is too small &amp; too casual to support rules either way, but we get &quot;/g LFM for ____&quot; all the time.  Sometimes people form up, sometimes its nothing but crickets.  IMO, if your feelings are hurt either way here, you need an &quot;perspective adjustment&quot; anyway.  Everyone has their own thing going on, and you are just extending a helping hand in the case that someone else really wanted to get a run going.  Your doing the guild a service!  Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />

That's why in my first guild I continued to do &quot;unscheduled&quot; /gchat invites because it helped the guild far more than any exclusive club of /w could ever do.  I told GL that all the time.  But their response was &quot;folks should schedule runs&quot; (I'm serious, they wanted us to schedule 5-man runs in the guild forums several days in advance, it never worked, yet GL always told folks to do it.).<br />
Several guilds on our server go as far as saying that their members are not allowed to us the LFG, but instead required to fill from in house.  My first guild was that way as well.  GLs strongly discouraged pugs because it didn't help the guild.  I understand that reasoning, but I only wanted to run 5-mans (never do PvP or dailies), so if I didn't get a group in guild, I'd pug.  It was either that or log off.<br />
<br />
I agree the whole thing seems very elitists and I told my first guild's leaders that several times.  I wish I still had access to their forums as their responses just didn't make any sense at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I am sure my guildies would agree, I am a scheduling Nazi when it comes to raids.  Not because I don't want new people, but because I hate sitting there at raid time and not knowing if JohnSmith is coming tonight or not.  <br />
<br />
That being said, scheduling 5-mans in WotLK is crazy.  Takes hours to setup a 20 min run! :Eyecrazy: <br />
<br />
In the early BC days, we would schedule heroics with my guild in advance.  That was because instances would take 90+ mins if they were run clean.  (Super small casual guild, need everyone on to form up!)  I think some GL's never really got past the fact that 5-mans are no more than &quot;Group Dailies&quot; now.  Naxx is the only lvl 80 instance that takes more than an hour with a clean run.</div></div><hr />

Takes hours to setup a 20 min run! I don't think it was a time issue.  Here's  what I think was their reasoning...<br />
<br />
 If you ask for a run in gchat and it does happen you get sad and frustrated and leave.<br />
 If you schedule a run it will happen and you'll be happy.<br />
<br />
Well my experience was that #1 can and does occur (it did for me in BC when I was a hunter and I hated it!).  #2 works on paper, but I noticed that very few folks responded to the requests in the forums (and there were maybe 1 per week, if that).  Which meant the run never happened.  So, you were left with running a pug (tolerated, but strongly discouraged), whisper invites, running dailies or leveling an alt.  The last two don't help the guild in raids.  And that is a big reason why I think my first guild struggled so much in raids.  Undergeared, wrong spec and little experience.  Two out of three can be improved from running lots of 5-mans.  Though I still saw folks roll on gear they didn't need but thought they did, so maybe 1.5 out of three are solved with 5-mans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people get to know each other from using /g to ask for help and get things done !!</div></div><hr />
