all other classes no problems!<br />
<br />
i cant get 1 heal through cause of his f.... silence and fear!<br />
<br />
im feral btw.<br />
<br />
my question now:<br />
is it normal that shadow priest is stronger at this lvl maybe?<br />
<br />
and another thing: <br />
are the stun durations of bash and pounce shorter in pvp than in pve??<br />
i cant get a regrowth through when i bash my enemy...<br />
<br />
maybe i'll farm me a anti-fear trinket!<br />
but unti now i didnt do much pvp so i dont have one right now.</div></div><hr />

maybe i'll farm me a anti-fear trinket!I highly recommend that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always have the pvp-trinket equipped if ready (trinketmenu and outfitter are handy for that).. Primal Tenacity high up in the feral tree might help at times.. but it's pretty random.<br />
<br />
As a small comfort though, both shadow priests and locks have a very hard  time vs rogues nowadays (and rogues are usually plentiful on all servers).. other casters like BOOMKINGS have it much easier there. :)</div></div><hr />

I still remember the fight because it went for over 10 minutes and eventually I won because she ran out of mana and only had a wand left.<br />
<br />
Anyway post duel the priest said that the only reason I won was because I ran away to heal out of range of silence. Probably this is true, it's the same tactic I use against warlocks as well, you have the speed use it I say. <br />
<br />
I don't know what spec you are but I was feral at the time (and still are), but getting out of range to recover and then charging back in seems to be a good tactic. Shadow priest spells don't have a huge range, even with talents.</div></div><hr />
