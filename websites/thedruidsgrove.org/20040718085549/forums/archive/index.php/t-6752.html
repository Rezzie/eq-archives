<br />
I've brought together as much of the information as I could into a semi reasonable order. <br />
<br />
I don't claim any rights to the information that I have collected. It has been the blood, sweat and tears of many friends, cohorts, and players just put all in one spot. I might also remove the link if it starts too much of a fuss. Until then, enjoy, and thank Safehouse, Graffe, and the EQ players at large for their help.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For the time being, this won't be updated for the public. If you do need more detailed information to Gates of Discord... please feel free to ;tell druzzil.kirynos at any time. I expect by the time summer rolls around, I'll put out a v2.0 for everyone. :crazeye: <br />

<br />
Maybe some minor errors: one I spotted is AoEs in Smith Rondo event are not casted by the named but by the adds. A very very good work anyway :)</div></div><hr />

You go in, and must kill approximately 90-100 monsters (was recently changed).<br />
curious to know if these mobs summon? <br />
<br />
Also with the smith rondo quest, would it be possible for me to just hand him the weapon tips without anyone in the raid doing the stone / note part?<br />
also, the weapon master that spawns, whats his max hit? and will he spawn pets like the other masters do?<br />
Just trying to do a little research before I lead the blind in to battle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">straatius</div><div class="date">03-11-2004, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The previous quest parts do not have bearing on the flag for KT. Though, you can get a nice progressive augment if you do decide to go the quested route. If you do the pre-quest stuff, you get a note. If you don't, you don't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">israfel</div><div class="date">03-12-2004, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the rondo info, know anything about the creatures in vxed? My main is a bard and I love kiting. just wondered if I could kite them.... I think myself and 2 other bards could pound out about 100 mobs in 6 hours easy. one mob every 5-6 = 10-12 an hour, 60-72 on my own in a 6 hour period. 60 x 3 =180 in a 6 hour period. So in just over 3 hours 3 bards could take 100 mobs providing they don't summon. Having a druid on the side to heal snare and suplement the dmg is Always nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">straatius</div><div class="date">03-14-2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe they summon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Near the south end of the zone, about 1/2 the mobs summon.  Eventually a yellow con (i.e. not harmony-able) summoning mob will spawn and you're screwed.<br />
<br />
Cragbeasts, hynids, and pookas do not summon.<br />
<br />
Stonemites, ikaavs, golems and most (but not all) of the humanoid things summon.<br />
<br />
Near the north end of the zone (where the hail mob is) I would say 3/4 or more of the mobs summon.  They max hit for 1050 or so, some run and bard speed, and some snare, so there's really no realistic chance of training to the hail mob.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you want to win, you gotta have a tank.  Although with some finesse and a little bit of luck, an enchanter pet can work as your tank.<br />
<br />
Oh and mobs have in the neighborhood of 22k hps.</div></div><hr />
