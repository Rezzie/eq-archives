(EDIT:  faction is needed for the summoning *and* to get the quest for the progressing items.  The items themselves are tradeable.  One could buy these items from the AH but they would still need someone with the faction to perform the summons) So, a guild could collect for get one person to revered and give the guild access to Royals.<br />
<br />
Ok, big hint:  Twilight Encrypted Texts are the best faction for Cenarian Circle.  Horde them.<br />
<br />
I completed the quest &quot;The Calling&quot; last week.  The rewards were not quite as good as my Cenarian set.  DO THIS QUEST!  It is well worth it.<br />
<br />
For healer druids:  These are some of the best boots in the game, pre epic.  I have my Cenarian but these are soooo close stat-wise.  The pants will ROCK for AQ if you're uber.<br />
<br />
Tbot says the end mob for this quest is really tough.  We did it with 28 people in a PuG.  We completed the encounter in under 5 minutes.  It'd be challenging for a team of UBRS'ers but definitely doable, easy for a team of MC'ers.  You do not want too many people.  The end guy gains health for each person that dies.</div></div><hr />

Summon him, lure him all the way to the troops near the south entrance of Cenarion Hold, and they'll take him down in a heartbeat. It's thievery man!<br />
<br />
Make sure you guys save those leggings. It'll be important for AQ, like Create stated. :]</div></div><hr />

I summonned, tagged him with moonfire, and pulled him to the guards.  It seemed like a good idea as the guards are right there.<br />
<br />
As the guards took him down I stayed back and kept insect swarm r1 up.  I wanted to continue to do damage but I did not want to do enough to out aggro the npc's.  They took him down but I did not receive credit.  I only tried once so it may just be my bad luck.<br />

I miss the EQ days sometimes.  Does anyone remember Fansy's trains?  Let's put this guy in the middle of one.</div></div><hr />

Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold in Silithus wants you to recover the Crystal Unlocking Mechanism from the Qiraji Emissary.<br />
<br />
You have been instructed to take the Glyphs of Calling to the Bones of Grakkarond, south of Cenarion Hold, and draw them in the sand. Should the Qiraji Emissary appear, slay it and recover the Crystal Unlocking Mechanism. Return to Geologist Larksbane if you succeed.<br />
<br />
Assemble an army for this task, &lt;name&gt;!<br />
<br />
Crystal Unlocking Mechanism: 0/1<br />
<br />
The glyphs illustrate an emissary of the Qiraji meeting with three silithid at the bones of a large dragon. Above the glyphs is what I can only assume to be a code of some sort. This code might very well be the key to summoning the emissary.<br />
<br />
I will create a copy of the glyph code that you must use in the sand at the Bones of Grakkarond. If I am right, the Overlords will come thinking that new data is ready for transmission. Strike them down and confront the emissary. He holds the key to the crystals...<br />
<br />
-Glyphs of Calling Provided<br />
<br />
Complete walkthrough<br />
<br />
Here is a complete walkthrough I just created for my guild detailing the entire quest chain with pictures. Enjoy...<br />
<br />
The quest line starts at Cenarion Hold in Silithus: <br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling_map1.jpg<br />
<br />
Talk to Commander Mar'alith and he will give you a quest called “Dearest Natalia”.<br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling1.jpg<br />
<br />
Then head south to the Bronzebeard Encampment: <br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling_map2.jpg<br />
<br />
Speak with the 2 dwarves there- Frankal Stonebridge and Rutgar Glyphshaper (also make sure you pet the monkey): <br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling2.jpg<br />
<br />
They will tell you a big story about how this lady went crazy, which completes the “Dearest Natalia” quest and unlocks 2 other mini-quests which you must also complete.<br />
<br />
The names of these quests are “Breaking the Code” which will be given to you by Frankal and “Glyph Chasing” which will be given to you by Rutgar. *Note: Rutgar also hands you a ‘Geologist's Transcription Kit’ which is needed to complete his quest, so if you accidentally delete it just abandon the quest and talk to him again to get a new one.<br />
<br />
Now before you start these quests, return to Commander Mar'alith in Cenarion Hold and turn in the “Dearest Natalia” quest. He will give you a new quest called “Into the Maw of Madness”, which you will complete while doing the other 2.<br />
<br />
Basically these quests are going to take you into the 3 hives of Silithus (Hive'Ashi, Hive'Zora and Hive'Regal): <br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling_map3.jpg<br />
<br />
It doesn’t matter which ones you do first, however I recommend a party of 5 to move through it quickly (although you can still do it fairly easy with 2-3 skilled people).<br />
<br />
SUMMARY OF &quot;GLYPH CHASING&quot;: In the middle of each hive that is a cave that you need to enter and explore until you find the final room. In this room there will be a small white crystal that you use the ‘Geologist's Transcription Kit’ on to obtain the rubbing. This quest is completed once you obtain a rubbing from each Hive.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY OF &quot;BREAKING THE CODE&quot;:  Make sure you check the bodies of each bug you kill on the way to (and from) the final room of each hive. You are looking for a white quest item named “xxx Silithid Brain” (xxx being the name of the hive). It is a random drop so if you haven’t gotten it by the time you finished coming out of the cave then make sure you continue killing bugs until it drops. This quest is completed once you obtain a Silithid Brain from each Hive.<br />
<br />
SUMMARY OF &quot;INTO THE MAW OF MADNESS&quot;: Inside the final room Hive'Regal you will find a Night Elf priest named Natalia Mar'alithnamed. This quest is completed once you kill her and loot the item from her body.  (Don’t forget to obtain the rubbing from the crystal in that room).<br />
<br />
Once you complete all 3 quests return to Commander Mar'alith in Cenarion Hold and turn in “Into the Maw of Madness”. Then return to the dwarves in Bronzebeard Encampment and turn in “Breaking the Code” to Frankal and “Glyph Chasing” to Rutgar.<br />
<br />
At this point Rutgar will give you another quest named ” Unraveling the Mystery”. This quest is simple, just take the ‘Glyphed Crystal Prism’ that he gives you to Geologist Larksbane in Cenarion Hold: <br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling3.jpg<br />
<br />
She will then give you the final quest named “The Calling”!<br />
<br />
At this point you will need a group of 25-40 people to kill the Emissary Roman’khan. If your guild is already raiding AQ-40 then it's prolly easiest to just wait until the next raid night and kill him prior to heading inside. Otherwise have fun spamming the LFG channel.<br />
<br />
He is summoned at the Bones of Grakkarond: <br />
<br />
http://www.unifiedguild.com/downloads/pics/thecalling_map4.jpg<br />
<br />
Once he is dead check his body for loot and then return to Geologist Larksbane in Cenarion Hold. Once you turn in “The Calling” she will give you another quest that you instantly turn in to claim your reward and receive your +25 NR legs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the actual boss, make sure you either stand directly under his feet so you don't take dmg from the AoE (nature? I think so) damage. Most of us were successful at avoiding damage but some of the noobs who tagged along because we allowed them to ;), couldnt do it so they hdi behind the bones and ran out, cast some spells, ran behind but there aren't too many spots in which you can avoid the AoE behind the bones..</div></div><hr />
