In addition, the second annual BlizzCon (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon07/index.shtml) is just over a week away!</div></div><hr />

Can't wait for BlizzCon too. Always exciting news from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-27-2007, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">9 million is pretty crazy... though I wonder how many are in the U.S., and how many are in Europe/Asia.In the 8M Press Release (http://www.blizzard.com/press/070111.shtml) (11-Jan-07, 5 days before BC was released).  The percentages are listed:<br />
 45% China (3.5M) 25% NA (2M) 18% Europe (1.5M) 12% Other (1M)<br />
<br />
Given that BC has NOT been released in China, I have to assume in the 9M PR, the percentages of NA, Europe and Other have increased.  So, once BC is released in China, the total numbers should increase again.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to know is how many of these &quot;new&quot; users are reactivations vs. truly new players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
after spending much time overseas in the asia areas i can tell you 100% that once it was released, they had it in mass.</div></div><hr />

Plus, the CD key is required, which I assume may have to match the localized version of your base WoW client.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and there are alot of ways to re route connections to get them on the WoW servers just based on using proxy servers.<br />
<br />
but the biggest thing is asia is the &quot;private&quot; wow servers.  those private servers are locked at version 1.3 and can not run TBC, well not since the last time i talked to anyone in korea.</div></div><hr />

I do the math every time a PR is released to gawk at the astronomical amount of money that Blizz is hauling in (9x10^6 X $15= $135x10^6 monthly :crazeye: ), but I can't imagine 4 million Chinese are paying the equivalent of $13-15 a month in their economy. Does anybody know what other continents pay for monthly fees?</div></div><hr />

They also don't pay for the boxed game, but just download it online.</div></div><hr />
