<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">08-19-2008, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there.  I've recently been grouping with a mage and ranger.  While the ranger just plinks the mobs with arrows, the mage is doing some nice dps with nukes and pet.  Unfortunatley I'm finding it difficult to maintain agro while kiting wereorcs or worgs in Loping plains.  The mage pet ends up tanking at some point which I then turn and heal it.  I'd rather keep agro kiting and let the mage pet do most of the work.  I even tried to repeat cast good-ole flamelick to regain the agro and it didn't work all that great.  Could I be doing something wrong?  FYI - I'm pretty sure I asked the mage friend to turn taunt off from the pet and it's still getting the agro.<br />
<br />
Basically - how does a druid agro kite and keep the agro when mage pets are doing so much damage?<br />

so just as long as they give you time to get a good amont of damage done yoru self its a pita to hold good agro once they have it. but in cases weer they do pull it off me a fast NBW will set it back on you fast enuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The days of snare and chaining flame lick in HoH GY are long gone - I'd suggest you snare and get at least two  dots on before anyone else touches it</div></div><hr />

<br />
agro kiting with about any other class is tough since most classes can out DPS us so quick<br />
<br />
and i'm not sure but i remember talks about them messing with our good ole standby of flamelick</div></div><hr />

You need to be doing damage if you intend to play chase-the-druid.   The NBW line does wonders to maintain agro, but it is mana intensive.  The Winter's line of nukes also is supposed to generate extra hate, although it doesn't seem like much to me.<br />
<br />
Make sure your mage buddy has taunt off, and preferably using his water pet for the backstabs.  The massive stuns from the air pet are going to gank agro from you regularly.  Mage can also /pet nocast if he has the AAs for it, but then you are giving up a little damage from the pet.<br />
<br />
Best way I have found to manage agro is by using HOTT.  The instant you see the mob change target -- sit down and you'll get agro back right now. Nothing pisses a mob off more than a seated caster!  It buys you a little time to get the mob coming back towards you so you can cast for more agro.   Obviously, don't do this if the mob is a foot away from you hehe.</div></div><hr />

I guess I was expecting the spam cast flamelick to work.  Was the agro to that spell changed in a patch?  Or is the hate generated by the high lvl damage spells just over powering?<br />
<br />
Taking things into consideration, I think it might be best for me to bring the mob down to 92-95% before my Mage friend starts doing dmg with spells and pet.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll have another chance to try your suggestions out over this weekend.  I'll let you all know how it goes!</div></div><hr />
