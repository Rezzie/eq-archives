<br />
I'm new here.<br />
<br />
I hope I'm in the right forum section.<br />
<br />
I decided to stop lurking and post my question. <br />
I'm using the Logitech MX518 mouse and don't get me wrong, I love it. But... It's time for a new mouse. I've had the 518 for years and it's starting to fade and tear in some spots.<br />
<br />
I just came across this on the internet a few days ago and I would like some reviews on it from true gamers because I am, thus far, planning on getting one.<br />
<br />
It's called the Naga. The video below is the best example of it that I've found so far.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
It's a 17 button mouse. Mainly for avid MMORPG players, but could be used for photoshop and other games.<br />
It looks incredible! Glows blue. Tangle free mesh cord which is suppose to be LOOOONG.<br />
<br />
The video does a great job showing you everything about it in a short amount of time. Check it out if you want. I have a feeling this Razr gamer gear might change how we play PC games in the future.<br />
<br />
I'm getting ahead of myself though, I really want some opinions. Good or bad.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I'm intruding with such an extensive post for a newcomer.<br />
Thanks for your time!<br />

Hmm. with EQ being an MMORPG I thought my chances were high.</div></div><hr />

I stick with the Logitech G-series mice, myself.  17 buttons?  I'd never be able to tell which was which without looking at them. :p</div></div><hr />
