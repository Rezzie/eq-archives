<br />
I got an answer to that one actually. <br />
<br />
They want to standardize mana drain effects so that it's always the same slot and doesn't overwrite buffs.  But I don't know when they plan to do it.<br />

This is more class balance, and not something the code department can handle.<br />

<br />
Secondary Recall (AA) uses the standard gate code and can fail.  The AA does not reset on fail, and requires you to wait 10 minutes before trying again.<br />
<br />
Call of the Wild (AA) can fail.  When the AA fails due to player zoning or other reasons - the AA greys out and can't be used again until recycle is up.<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Wood / Convergence of Spirits - The Damage Shield should be made so that it only applies in conjunction with another DS buff.  Right now the effects are a hindrance to several raids.<br />
<br />
Stacking:  This is a spell issue, but I think requires a code level fix - Allow the Single Version of a spell to overwrite the group version.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Blessing of the Direwild overwrites Direwild Skin<br />
Direwild Skin does not overwrite Blessing of the Direwild - even tho they have the same values.<br />
<br />
It's annoying to make people click off buffs to refresh them.<br />
<br />
Exodus:  If several mobs are in camp, and you hit Exodus, you often die - even if you are full health due to the delay in the client telling the server you want to zone.  We would like to see this addressed so that isn't as common.<br />
<br />

I am keeping track of the Spell and AA changes, but those are not handled by the Code Department.</div></div><hr />

All we need is a way to identify a spell from the Aegolism line and a spell from the druid skin line.  This can be done with &quot;dummy&quot; effects, perhaps effect #24, the now-useless &quot;Decrease Stamina Loss&quot;.<br />
<br />
Add this to every druid skin spell:<br />
Slot 11: Increase Stamina Loss by 1<br />
Slot 12: Stacking: Block new spell if slot 12 is effect 'Increase Stamina Loss' and &lt; 2<br />

Slot 11: Stacking: Block new spell if slot 11 is effect 'Increase Stamina Loss' and &lt; 2<br />

This would replace the current stacking restrictions based on hp and AC.  No code changes should be needed.</div></div><hr />

I assume you also mentioned the Spirit of Eagle, Flight of Eagles problem.  The Skins and Eagles both are about the only spells in the entire game with this problem.  Also, be sure to mention that it is all (or at least several) druid skins, not just Direwild.  I assume the new Iron Skin we get also has this problem, although I don't have it yet.<br />
<br />
Of course, the fact that cleric spell haste lets you have multiple versions on you at the same time also needs to be fixed but that is something I imagine the cleric correspondent handles.<br />
<br />
The other issues you mentioned are good to get fixed as well.  Good job, thanks for working on this.</div></div><hr />

So they need to upgrade single speed (preferred) or lower group speed (not preferred) and then fix this.</div></div><hr />

Sigh.<br />

I'm not talking about different levels.  I have never even seen Aura of Resolve yet, I'm only level 76 and no cleric in my guild is 77 yet, or at least wasn't last night.<br />
<br />
I'm talking Blessing of Purpose and Aura of Purpose.  Both do exactly the same thing.  One is group, the other is single.  You can have both on you at the same time, when they really should overwrite each other.</div></div><hr />

heh, spell haste is its own animal<br />

you could fill up your entire buff bar with every rank and every iteration of this spell.  I remember raiding Sullon Zek's tower once and noticing I had 4 different versions of Purpose on me at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last time I attempted to cast Form of the Hunter on myself, I got the message, &quot;Your spell did not take hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
I assume it was because I had some kind of ATK buff on me that increased my ATK more than Form of the Hunter would.  I can list all the buffs I had on me at the time (I had room for more buffs, by the way) if anyone cares.<br />
<br />
Frankly, as I said in the Class Issues forum, all wolf form spells need to be totally redone, but since I doubt they will bother (they killed off wolf form and I was shocked with they fixed the faction problem but obviously that was a bone and not any real thoughts on fixing) I figured at least in the Code Changes, they could adjust the effect of wolf form somehow to let it stack with other ATK buffs (no way that it could be considered overpowering in this day and age).<br />
<br />
Or maybe remove the ATK buff, if they have to (because they are lazy and don't care about us), unless someone here will scream.  I mean it is a self buff and the idea that 62 (L60) to 82 (L80) ATK is gonna make a difference in our druid melee is a non issue, I think.<br />
<br />
Face it, wolf form is so marginalized that it is only used for fun and for the speed bonus and for the fact that it lasts so much longer than sow, and no levi effect like soe.  At least they could let it work for us when we want to use this pretty useless spell to goof around.</div></div><hr />
