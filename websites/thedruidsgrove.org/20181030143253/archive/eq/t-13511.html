This is a series of 3 missions. It appears you can do them in any order.. The missions start in the room next to Dain Frostreaver IV in Icewell Keep. Hail Dain's Historian Duggans to start the missions. He is Dain's Historian Duggins, on the third floor of Icewell Keep East of the throne room at p675, n65. Each mission drops 1 portion of the seal. The seal you receive is probably dependent upon your character level at the time:<br />

The augments do not show any stats until you equip them. It also appears that the augments are evolving, even though they are not marked as such. I have completed the first 2 missions and looted the seal from each. But my diamond studded augment is showing significantly lower stats. (I am level 70). I will watch my augment to see if it changes as I do more dain missions.<br />
 <br />
Strategy for &quot;The Defense of Thurgadin&quot; Part I aka Dain Frostreaver the First:<br />
 <br />
Talk to Historian Duggans to get the mission. We did the mission with 5 people. One person is required to be Dain Frostreaver. In addition, we had 2 healers and 2 tanks. The last time we did it, we finished in about 30 minutes. This mission takes place in the Great Divide.<br />
 <br />
Here's what the mission consisted of: <br />
Kill 3 named giants (chieftains?): One is in the giant fort, one is next to the river on the far side of the mountains from Thurgadin, the last one is next to the dragon ring. The one in the fort is accessed by killing one of the guards at the fort entrance. The other guard has a low aggro range. The Chieftain is straight ahead inside the entrance. The 2nd is near the river. He has 4 guards. Dain aggro's and kills the Chieftain while the other 2 tanks kill the guards. Keep the guards off of the healers. Do the same at the Dragon Ring. <br />
 <br />
Kill 8 wolves: <br />
Kill the 8 wolves that are near the entrance to Thurgadin. If Dain is low on mana, he should med while the other tanks dispatch the wolves. Try to single pull them if possible. <br />
 <br />
Kill The Warlord: The Warlord will spawn at the entrance to Thurgadin. The clerics should position themselves high on the wall to avoid his AE knockback. Dain will aggro him and back into the right corner. After Dain has aggro the other tanks will fight him from behind. <br />
 <br />
Everyone needs to loot a shard. Pass out the other loot. <br />
 <br />
Zone into Thurgadin. Turn the seal into the historian. You have now completed the 1st step of the mission. Hail the historian for the 2nd part when everyone in your group has looted the seal from the 1st part. The mission only drops one seal per attempt, so you will have to do the 1st part until everyone has one.<br />

Strategy for &quot;The Defense of Thurgadin&quot; Part III aka Dain Frostreaver the Third:<br />
 <br />
This mission takes place in Great Divide. It is an event silimar to the Ring War event. 3 waves of giants try to make it to Thurgadin or kill the Dain. You have a Coldain army to help you. If they begin wandering (after their captain dies) and you can tell them to &quot;follow me&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Strat from post by Beatslayer:<br />
 <br />
Send all units to attack before each wave.  As soon as you arrive in GD, tell the General &quot;Unit A forward&quot; and he'll repeat your command, then tell him &quot;unit B forward&quot; &quot;unit C forward' and &quot;unit D forward&quot;.  This makes all coldain troops sit on the spawn spot of where giants pop, near EW<br />
<br />
Run to EW zone line and wait with the squads of giants while they prepare to charge.<br />
<br />
Stand Dain toe to toe with the named of each wave with attack on, to get instant agro each time they become active.<br />
<br />
Have a cleric standing nearby to chain CH once the fight begins.<br />
<br />
By attacking named, Dain will hold agro on EVERY MOB at once while the coldain attack safely. <br />
<br />
A single cleric chain casting Ch on dain will keep him alive safely through the first through third waves. On the last wave, you will have to have some fancy footwork to stretch the CH's out till your coldains have killed enough of hte giants. Or else, bring a 2nd cleric to rotate the CH's.<br />
<br />
Also, as long as dain is in melee range of every giant, and the coldains are beating them up as well, your cleric will not pull agro from CH's. Just start Ch as soon as you see the yellow emote &amp; dain start to swing. <br />
<br />
Using this method, I was able to 3 box the task without losing any coldain troops. <br />
<br />
On the coldain #1 MM, use lazy agro range to split named from adds and that mission too will become 3 boxable.<br />
<br />
You may have to pull the first wave of giants towards the spires because the Coldain are slow to show up for the 1st wave.  Also, after each wave, someone has to go give new commands to the general or else the Coldain head back to their camp.<br />

It has not become more powerful as I completed additional Dain I missions.  From reading SOE boards, it's said to only increase on turning in the next step Dain mission portion.  Dain I is the weakest level of the augment, Dain II slightly more powerful, and Dain III the most powerful.<br />
<br />
Tonight we will be doing the Dain II missions.  I don't expect to do much more than double the stats on my augment after turning in that portion.  The stats increase the most after turning in the portion from Dain III.  At that point, it's my understanding the augment will be<br />

I swapped the platinum &amp; the diamond historical seals in my write up. Thanks for the correction.<br />
 <br />
If this is like other missions, you can have all 3 seals, if you get them at the proper levels then level up to get the next augment.<br />

Thats how to win the third task flawlessly.<br />
 <br />
Thanks Beatslayer. I incorporated your strat into the top post. I look forward to trying it out tonight or tomorrow.<br />
 <br />
Can you elaborate on what you mean by &quot;lazy aggro&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gereg</div><div class="date">03-12-2006, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, we did it. But, we had to pull first wave of giants to the spires. Then someone had to go back and give commands to the general after each wave. The coldain were too slow to get there for the first wave, but they made it to the spires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beatslayer</div><div class="date">03-12-2006, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lazy agro range = the exact distance you have to get from a mob so he will give up the chase and go home.<br />
<br />
Mobs will only pursue a NPC until they reach a certain distance away.  So, if you piss off a pack of mobs and out run them, the mobs in the back of the pack will give up pursuit first as the leading mobs continue forward. Once you see this, stop outrunning them and allow the front runner mobs to gain a lead while the outran mobs go home.  They will stay seperated as long as you never get close enough to them to encourage them to resume the pursuit.<br />
<br />
In reference to Coldain MM #1, you gotta turn up both clip and actor planes up all the way, then watch for the last couple giants in the pack to start 'running in place' as they chase you, as they cease advancing.<br />
<br />
Addition info about forcing all 4 units to attack immediately:  Hail the general and he'll say some junk with [orders] in brackets. when you say 'orders',  he'll say somethin like: [advance troops] [retreat] and [attack]. When you say attack, he says [unit a forward] [unit b forward] [unit c forward] and [unit d forward]. When you say 'unit a forward', you will see him reply in an odd text &quot;unit a forward&quot;. once you see this wait a sec then proceed to tell him &quot;unit b forward&quot; and repeat thru unit c and d. From the general, you should then see all coldain troops start to march to EW zoneline.<br />
<br />
Even if you run straight to the general as soon as you enter the zone and tell him to forward all units to attack, they'll still only get to the great spire before they cross paths with the giants, here's where first fight will likely take place. When the wave is over, BE SURE TO TELL the general the 4 lines of text to advance units a - d forward again, and do this each time a wave dies.</div></div><hr />

Objectives (from the top of my head):<br />
<br />
*Kill 10x Kromrif Master Scout<br />
*Locate the Scout Head Quarters<br />
*Kill Omref Stompsmash<br />
*Escape<br />
<br />
Kael map: http://eqatlas.com/velious/kaeldrakkalmap.html<br />
<br />
Few pointers about the mission:<br />
<br />
-Mission starts at the EW zoneline.<br />
<br />
-Have everyone select runspeed 4 as part of their aa's.<br />
<br />
-The regular Kromrif Scouts start fleeing at 75% - and they run pretty fast. Need to have everyone who can root help out with keeping them rooted - they're silly resistant.<br />
<br />
-The Kromrif Master Scouts do not flee.<br />
<br />
-Pull far back so you have room to stop the mobs when they flee.<br />
<br />
-If the Kromrif Scouts make their way to the commoner building (#7 on the above map), it spawns 3 mobs (forgot name - weren't too hard, don't flee).<br />
<br />
-The scout head quarters are the building at Iceshard Keep (#11 on the map, but the first room in that building complex).<br />
<br />
-The named roams inside the first building. Have someone who is not Dain pull from inside. Pull out 2-3 mobs, so you can get named single. You're gonna have to rely a bit on luck for this. If puller gets too many, just stand and die and you repop at zone. But if Dain dies, it's all over.<br />
<br />
-After named dies, you have 2-3 minutes to get out of the zone. Enraged Giants (redcon) start spawning all over the place. It's possible to train past, but why risk it? Sort loot quickly (maybe even in advance), or try pulling him to the zone (we didn't get to test this).<br />
<br />
We spend some hours getting this down. Think our run took around 45-50 minutes when we finally beat it. It's not very bot friendly at first, but I think we had 2 bots in a full group of 6. Wouldn't recommend going with less at first, since you need dps, rooting and heals on multiple tanks. Hope the following info is useful for those looking to try the mission.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That seems to be a pathing issue - you have to stay very close, or he forgets about you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miakiss</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes he seems to memblur himself randomly - I found it easiest using one of the characters with a nuke spell to pull him. And probably best to bring the group at least down past the first bridge thing to make the pull a bit shorter - still plenty of time to get to the zone out from there.<br />
 <br />
And a note on boxing the first mission: the hardest chieftain is the one to the south as he has two shamans with him who cast a snare spell and give the mobs a run speed buff. What I do is take a cleric and warrior over for the pull. I then cast a HoT on the tank and pull the chieftain with an axe. I leave the cleric to die - as that buys a few seconds. The tank almost always gets snared at least once, but the HoT is enough to keep him up, and then you just have to hope that the shamans choose to cast something else, or whack the cleric.<br />
 <br />
I then take a big loop around the zone and usually end up bringing the chieftain and one or two scouts back to the group. The Dain, warrior and one cleric is then enough to finish them off.</div></div><hr />

To avoid summoning, you must make sure your tank is in melee range of EVERY giant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Mission One - <br />
least amount of people i've done it with is 2, but one person was three boxing.  It took a bit of time, but was doable.  I like it best with at least 5 people, so you can pick 2 clerics, warrior, dain, and the bez.  At giant fort just kill two guards and then can single the named.  Next is the 4 guards plus named at the river.  Have the warrior get the two guards on the right, the bez get the two guards on the left, and dain get the named.  One cleric can heal named and one cleric can heal the other two guys.  The druid port in is set up the same, so do it the same way.<br />
<br />
The 8 wolves are all really easy.  The clerics can sit it out to med, while dain and the two tanks pull a wolf apiece.  Sometimes we even get a cleric just to go pull all the wolves so it goes quicker.  <br />
<br />
The last named is really easy -- just reverse pin him in the corner and he spawns in and you should be good to go.  One cleric can heal dain fine for this, but if you aren't sure just start with a cheal rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mission Number Two:<br />
Only did this one once to be honest, but it was pretty easy.  Have whoever zones the quickest be dain: in this mission dain needs to be a wimp and zone if he gets aggro.  Have all people who can root change root the scouts.  Pull everything to the zoneline so if something does run you can root it.  Named guys don't run and are easy, so they do not need to be rooted.  <br />
<br />
We did move to the room with the named to kill him.  He was fairly easy -- we did have the warrior die once, though.  Just make sure clerics do a rotation and start off with a hot and you should be good to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mission Number Three:<br />
Hands down the hardest one.  I've done it many many times and have wiped on the last wave the majority of these attempts.  We don't let dain fight at all -- he gives the orders to the general.  We will kill the first two waves at the wizard spires (but make sure not to attack without your army), but we fight the last two down by the river.  To be safe use a cheal rotation on all waves.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If I think of anything else to add, I'll add it.  If you have any questions I can try to answer you.  I am by no means an expert, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">06-05-2006, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been having pretty decent luck with the 3rd mission by having the Dain wait at general to give the orders to the units, and everyone else fights at base camp.  We have the rogue tag the named to try and pull him away from the group of giants, and have all the units join in once the giants get to camp.  We normally don't lose any soldiers until the 4th wave.  The viction cleric seems to die a lot, but the only time you really need him is on the 4th wave to help on the tank.  Dain comes down to the camp to re-clarity the healers in between waves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tryon</div><div class="date">06-05-2006, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure that the Drawves are a LOT weaker at base camp then if you let them charge out.  Here's what I do when I lead a Mission #3, and it's almost trivial.<br />
<br />
Zone in and send all 4 squads out immediately, then have the group run to the wizard spires.  The first wave of giants will meet the drarves somewhere near there.  Trivial wave.  Just never use AE taunt or you will aggro the dwarves.<br />
<br />
As soon as all the giants are dead have Dain go back and immediately resend the drarfs again.  Usually don't have trouble keeping Dain alive for waves 2 and 3, but if you want to have him stay at the commander to be safe, then it's not a bad idea.<br />
<br />
For the next 2 waves, move the group up the hill where the giants spawn and hang out for a bit before thehy become attackable.  The Drarves should be standing at the feet of the next wave of giants by the time they start to march.  Have your tank ready to go standing at the feet of the named as well with him targeted and with attack on.  Have the healers off to the side.  It's hard to time when to cast a HoT on the tank, but try to land one as the giants start attacking.  Do this for waves 2 and 3.  And always have Dain immediately send the dwarves back into battle as soon as the last giant dies.  They will just march back and wait under the giants.<br />
<br />
Wave 4, Have the group go back down the hill towards the wizard spires.  Have your tank at the foot of the hill in front of the rest of the group with the named targeted.  The tank should be as far as he can get from the giants and still be able to see them with max clipping plane.  When you see the named giant's HPs start to drop, all charge up the hill.  MOST of the time, the named will come down the hill and meet you half way, SOME of the times he'll be SINGLE.   As long as you didn't goof off for the first 3 waves, your dwarves should be able to handle the remaining giants with ease.  Kill the named, loot, and go help finish off the giants.</div></div><hr />

This is very important for the cleric to regen mana since after conviction to every body the cle is oom. Therefore our group always has a paly.</div></div><hr />
