<br />
The alchy stone is not a necklace so that is not a fair question.  though the alchy stone has a lot os defense isn't really a good trinket to use considering we do not pop health or mana pots like a warrior or pally can.<br />
<br />
3 for dps again I cannot see those but if I remember correctly BB is lots of crit and a ap boost on use so if the second has better stats you can replace it with the second.  In kitty form you want agi over crit because that increases ap crit and armor.  Thats my 2 cents and I curse my job for blocking wowhead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunat</div><div class="date">09-02-2008, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can pop healthstones and potions in bear form, there is a macro somewhere here that allows you to shape out potion/healthstone and back into bear mode.   All within .2 seconds.   I use it all the time tanking.   Easy to avoid getting hit with .2 second useage.   I have used it tanking several mobs 5-6 and clicked that macro and never once got hit out of bear form.   Oh it works if your in cat form also if your dps'ing or soloing.<br />
Edit: I found the macro its<br />
<br />
#showtooltip<br />
/cancelform [stance:1]<br />
/use [nostance] Super Healing Potion<br />
/use [nostance] Master Healthstone<br />

/stopmacro [nostance]<br />
/cancelform [stance:3]<br />
/use Super Healing Potion<br />
/use Master Healthstone<br />

Just make SURE your global cooldown is UP when you click it otherwise you will be stuck in caster mode untill you manually shape back into bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimjonn</div><div class="date">09-02-2008, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh I wasn't thinking when I posted the Assassin's Alchemist Stone. I meant Pendant of Resolve (http://www.wowwiki.com/Shattered_Sun_Pendant_of_Resolve). There's too many good rewards at SSO exalted.<br />
<br />
The Staff of Natural Fury has less armor than Braxxis' Staff but a lot more damage. For pure survivability I'm wondering if Braxxis is better. On the other hand if I can't keep aggro I'm not much good.<br />
<br />
The Necklace is basically +44 stamina, +21 agility. The Pendant is +48 stamina, +13 hit rating, +18 expertise and the power of the Arcane Effect. I'll probably keep the Necklace but that Pendant sounds interesting.<br />
<br />
I was hoping to replace one of the trinkets with the Assassin's Alchemist Stone but I forgot I'm not yet Revered with the Sha'tar. More grinding to do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">09-02-2008, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the SSO pendant (Scryer version) on trash (for the extra threat) and the NotD on boss fights.  I also have a NotD with 2 +8 agi gems I use in cat form and/or when I want more avoidance in bear rather than more health.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the staffs, I had Braxxis and then Earthwarden.  Never had the NF staff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">09-02-2008, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For Neck I'm going-<br />
<br />
Cat: Shattered Sun Pendant of Might,<br />
Bear: Necklace of the Deep w/ 2x 15 Stamina Gems.<br />
<br />
The necklace has about 6.5 more DPS than the Resolve. BUT there are no Gem slots like in the Necklace of the Deep, so IF you need specific gems like for the Relentless Earthstorm Diamond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32409), then you may need to make up some gem slots somewhere.<br />
<br />
Bear staff I would take neither. Earthwarden is probably the easiest Bear tanking staff to get for now. Only the Wildfury Great Staff (world drop) or Pillar of Ferocity (Mount Hyjal) are better. And you only need CE rep for the Earthwarden. If you have a good price on, or already own, the Braxis then equip it until you have one of those 3. It is very good.<br />
<br />
And in Kitty form I would choose the Bladefist Breadth's. In the short term, you want to replace that with either the Crystalforged Trinket (Ogri'la Revered) or Battlemaster's Determination (PvP). Otherwise that BB trinket is tight. Outside of drops in raid instances, the Bloodlust Brooch (41 badges) and Darkmoon Card: Crusade are top choices.<br />
<br />
Also for bear form don't neglect your trinkets. You can have quite a bit of fun going after Mark of Tyranny (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=13966) and Badge of Tenacity (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32658). The first one can be soloed up until UBRS in which you'll need 2 others to activate the first boss. After that, it can easily be done with one other assuming you know UBRS...but a 70 bear tank is a formidable beast.<br />
<br />
And the Badge is a great event in Ogri'la (solo only) that you will do every 5 days of dailies which you want rep for the Kitty trinket.<br />
<br />
And as an example, the Mark of Tyranny gives me over 1000 armor in bear form on top of the dodge. And the Aracane Resist will GUARANTEE you'll never be polymorphed. :grin:<br />
<br />
P.S. I have no idea why my armor changes by over 1k simply by equipping that trinket. 410% (Dire Bear + Thick Hide) of 180 is not close to 1k. But that's what my character sheet shows when I equip/dequip it.</div></div><hr />

I have left in the items I personally would choose.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In bear form:<br />
<br />
Staff of Natural Fury (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31334)<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Necklace of the Deep (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32508) with 2 solid stars of elune<br />
or<br />
Guardian's Alchemist Stone (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=35748)<br />
(assume uncrittable already)<br />
<br />
Necklace of the Deep is a neck - Guardian's Alchemist's Stone is a trinket.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
In kitty form:<br />
<br />
Bladefist's Breath (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28041)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimjonn</div><div class="date">09-05-2008, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, more pick questions. For Band of the Swift Paw, which is being used in both my kitty and bear forms at the moment:<br />
<br />
Enchant - +12 to stamina<br />
or<br />
Enchant - +4 to all stats<br />
<br />
Gem - +4 agility +6 stamina<br />
or<br />
Gem - +12 stamina<br />
or<br />
Gem - +8 agility<br />
<br />
The yellow socket gives +2 strength which is negligible. Part of me wants to say just go for the stamina all the way, but I tend to be dps on raids and occasionally an OT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the gem, I'd go for the +4 agi/+6stam because it's a nice balance.  It really depends though on your stats.   If you only OT and DPS a lot, might not want to go just pure stam.</div></div><hr />

In the end I just bought 2 and set one up for tanking and the other for dps :&gt;<br />
