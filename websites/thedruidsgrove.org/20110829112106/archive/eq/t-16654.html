 <br />
Is the FORAGE LIST still here?<br />
 <br />
Can you Bring the FORAGE LIST back if it isn't please? it would be useful to all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so, eqtraders.com might be a better place to ask:<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/forumdisplay.php?f=11<br />
Their database already contains most, if not all, foraged items and where they can be foraged.  It shouldn't be too difficult to add a page that lists them.<br />
<br />
Edit: Is this what you're looking for?<br />

<br />
I looked around our boards, and the only thing I found in regards to a forage list was a link to a download on one of the ranger class sites, but the post itself is about 2 years old, so the info would be slightly updated. I also found a very brief list that contained some forage info for the Prophecy of Ro expansion (Here (http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums/showthread.php?t=13395&amp;highlight=Forage) ) but it is most likely incomplete and not what you are looking for!<br />
<br />
The links that Palarran gave you should work for you, however. Have a good one :)</div></div><hr />
