<br />
Ok, what reason did you pick the name for your character?<br />
<br />
Electrae -- 65 cleric.  I have a DnD mage named Electra.  I always loved Greek civilization and mythology, thus the tribute.<br />
<br />
Lysteria Plushfoot -- Listeria is a bacteria which causes food poisoning. :p  I thought it made a pretty name for a halfling druid.<br />
<br />
Wysteria Plushfoot -- A Plushfoot Sister.  Named after the flower. My level 60 druid.  Was a main at one time.<br />
<br />
Panamah Malfleur -- Well, I didn't name her after the Van Halen song.  I didn't even think of it.  I just thought of Indiana Jones, kind of a cool adventurer name.  So I thought of place names, thought Panama would be a cool girls name.  Sounds high adventure.  Malfleur is bad french for bad flower.  Could think of it as a poisonous flower too.<br />
<br />
Tagra Purrfidious -- My Vah Shir shammy cat.  Tagra was as close to Tiger as I could get!  Purridious... well. :)  She was surnamed Itotitawapuddytat for awhile.<br />
<br />
Gliss -- My bard.  Named after glissando, a musical expression. :)<br />
<br />
Verra -- My enchanter.  She'll have a last name of Nass (Verra Nass) someday!<br />
<br />
Vexation -- my level 47 wizard.  :)<br />
<br />
Dent, Arthurdent (a deleted ogre warrior)<br />
<br />
Femurl (a necro, named after a leg bone)<br />
<br />
Those are the most memorable ones. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kineada (druid) - The anime movie Akira.  There are several variations on spelling but people recognize it if they've seen the movie.<br />
<br />
Milliardo Peacecraft (enchanter) - Gundam Wing.  Was an interesting character.  Milliardo was a spoiled prince who didn't seem to have any ambition while his alter ego, Zex Marquis was a warlord bent on world domination.<br />
<br />
Runrun (warrior) - Just loved the thought of a warrior named Runrun.  Even have an emote when I'm training the zone and I want to warn anyone I pass.  /em runs by you waving his arms and screaming like a girl.  Considering Runrun is an ogre warrior of Rallos Zek, I thought the name would lend a bit of irony.<br />
<br />
Marcadores (cleric) - Markers in spanish.  He's a spotted frog cleric so the name seemed appropriate.<br />
<br />
Ellric (enchanter) - of Melibone fame.  If you've never read Michael Moorcock's books, particularly with respect to Elric Kinslayer, you are missing out.  In retrospect, I should have made Ellric a shadow knight.  Then he could have wielded the black sword Stormbringer.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
Ixxaxxl (necromancer) - Just for the patern</div></div><hr />

My hubby started a WE ranger at the same time named Phread (Fred).  I didn't want it to look to blatantly obvious (Fred and Ginger), so we altered the spelling a bit.  Named because in the old models, WEs looked very much like professional dancers.  Now their uppers are too big and their lowers are too skinny.<br />
<br />
Brutimous Buddafwy (Ogress warrior)  Brutimous = Beautfiul + Gorgeous.  Her original last name was Barharlot, which is part of her backstory, eventually changed to Buddafwy because when asked &quot;If you could be anything you wanted&quot; Brutimous answered &quot;I'd be a buddafwy&quot;  She also thinks that little girl pink makes her pretty, thus her armor is dyed little girl pink except for her hat, gloves and boots.  In old models she looks like strawberry shortcake (the doll).<br />
<br />
Maleen Ixii (Dwarven cleric): Maleen is the name of a character from a relatively unknown Brother's Grimm Faerie tale.  It's a grusome story, she's the main character.  Ixii is 911 in roman numerals.</div></div><hr />

I was looking for some variations of the root Arach, and came up with that. My monk is named Araax.

<br />
Recent flowdown machines: mistral (the French &quot;crazy&quot; wind) and casablanca (okay, not a hat, but it's my favorite movie and a place name)<br />
<br />
Let's see...also dublin and havana (my solaris boxes - named in the old days, I was boring, just naming them after cities)...<br />
<br />
And my printers: cervino, stork, roadrunner, bertha, mufasa, hydra and the newest edition to the family, poodle (cute, but stupid printer - can't process much) =)<br />

Bogtrot (lvl 1 BL) - I made this when I got sick of monk and on the way out of Oogok I saw a bard that looked beautiful in plate banging their drum...I just could not marh my ugly butt out into the world. He will be next.<br />
Named after Bruce Bogtrotter from the movie Matilda. Also the bog in the green fields, the pete, etc.<br />

Of the unused I think the rogue and warrior were sent to a friends account. They are now cobwebbed there.<br />
Main was Druid, then Enchanter, then Monk, now Bard. Rogue was fun but I only played him a bit. My Druid is always kinda my main, just I do not do anything productive with him.<br />

Ironic that right at the end of Druid balance I quit, then shifted to the Monk as they were nerfed. Just got sick of the monk and started the Bard...and they nerf mana song. So if my (bad) luck holds they will nerf Bards just so I can play all my mains at their low points (save for the Enchanter). Druid and Enchanter are the classes I am most skilled at.<br />

None have last names. Always thought about surnaming my Druid Bogtrotter or Barreltoe.<br />

I had a good one for my monk as well but I forgot it before I went home so oh well.</div></div><hr />

My first real character was Sarrin (halfling warrior, now banned), because Sarin (yes, as in the nerve gas) was taken.<br />

Edit:  Oh yeah, surname came because I ended up downloading massive quantities of anime, I realized my character looked somewhat like Asuka, and in the end the whole thing sounds vaguely religious.</div></div><hr />

The second part of my name was given to me at the end of a 3 part GM event as the last act of an out going GM (Blixtev) from our server.  It was an event that involve the Banishing forever of a Powerful Wizard NPC named Marteen that had been terrorizing Freeport for a long time.  It is also I think a side ways joke to the fact that Blixtev liked to use high end curse effects like Marl and Gravel Rain on his villain NPCs and,  I was forever condemed to &quot;Banishing&quot; these effects as being one of the few GM event regulars with Remove Greater Curse and Pureblood.</div></div><hr />

He was basically a paladin who gave up his humanity (became a cyborg) to fight off a menace to his planet. Even talked like a classical paladin. ;)<br />
<br />
I took that named and modified it to &quot;Romidar&quot; for my first AD&amp;D character back in the early 80's.<br />
<br />
I'm always amused now when people call me &quot;Rom&quot; for short, given the genesis of my name.<br />
<br />
My druid's name was randomly generated and didn't get a last name until his 40's. Basically someone said something about &quot;the d@mn druid,&quot; but the badword filter (which I hadn't turned off on that account) changed it to &quot;the draw druid.&quot; The name Draw struck and I made it his last name - now everyone calls him &quot;The Draw.&quot; (For that matter, he refers to himself as The Draw - he always refers to himself in the 3rd person... it's funny how a 2-boxed character can develop such a different personality than the main, and he has QUITE the personality.)</div></div><hr />

Why Menlo?  It was short.  No other mystical reasoning.<br />

My paladin's name.   Baptismo.  It turns out to be Portugese for what it sounds like.  I didn't know that at the time, I just had to come up with a name that got passed the filters and wasn't too cheesy.<br />
<br />
Delacroix.  Its French, of the cross.  Seems to work, no?  I used to get grief about it from French people.  They'd find out I was American and say &quot;but that's a French name, don't you know that?&quot;  Um, like there is some international law that says I can't use it?

<br />
My alt (male) troll warrior, Fluffee Bunnee, was named for the humor value in seeing such an incongruous name above an ugly troll face.<br />
<br />
My female highelven enchanter alt, who never got past the early teens but was roleplayed as a &quot;girl power&quot; kinda gal, was named Circum.  I was tossing up whether to risk the attention of the GMs by choosing &quot;Sisam&quot; or &quot;Sizor&quot; as a surname.  Probalby would have ended up with Navigated or something equally humorless :)<br />
<br />
Finally, several friends and I named gnomish alts (wish they could have been monks!) Donatello, Raphael, Leonardo and Michaelangelo (or as close as the server would allow).  With a few more members we were planning a guild (for amusement value only) with a name like Hero's in the Halfshell, or if that failed something that abbreviated to TMNT).<br />

One of those writers started playing EQ, and I bought the game to see what he was so excited about.<br />
<br />
When I made my first character, I didn't know that eventually you would be able to have a surname, so that name I had chosen was: Sierradane.<br />
<br />
We then moved from Bristlebane to Luclin and I wanted to be Sierra, but someone else had it.  Had to add an extra A to be Sierraa.  When the time came for a surname, I threw in that extra A there as well: Daane.<br />
<br />
My other characters are named after characters I wrote for in teh Star Wars RP:<br />
Noelani (Bard-name sounds musical) and Daarian(Druid-I love Druids)  (there's those &quot;family&quot; two A's).  Some already had Trinity, another SW RP character, so I chose Tyrany for my Rogue.<br />
<br />
My enchanter, I named Saedie for no real reason other than I liked the name.  Laierra (Ranger) is a combination of my name and that of my EQ husband Laranis.<br />
<br />
Chloey (SW RP Character)<br />
<br />
