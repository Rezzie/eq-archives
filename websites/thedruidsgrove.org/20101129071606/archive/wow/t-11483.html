Been talking to some highlvl paladin friends of mine, and they all say that after the patch where we got Mangle, they just cant kill dr00ds anymore.<br />
<br />
Sooo. Tell me...<br />
Do i really suck that bad at pvp, or are palas at lvl 30-40 nearly impossible to kill for a equally leveled druid ?<br />
Does getting mangle make such a difference? (i know its good, but going from utterly useless to ownage in one skill sounds bit drastic =P )<br />
Any tactics for killing paladins ?<br />
<br />
If i get close to them i get stunned and practically oneshotted, if i try to range them, they just break my root and get close to stun and practically oneshot me ^^<br />
Ive even jumped a equal level paladin (lvl 36 at that moment) while he was at 70% health and had a mob on him, and still i wind up loosing.<br />
<br />
PLEEEASE HELP, ITS DRIVING ME INSANE!!!! :banghead:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apep</div><div class="date">01-22-2007, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not sure why u wanna fight a paladin<br />
2 reasons:<br />
1. im leveling, im in STV, i have no choice but to defend myself from paladins who attack me.<br />
2. since ive now been killed by belf paladins about 50 times in 37 levels im sick of them and just wanna rip their guts out when i see one, especially since i KNOW he will attack me no matter what i do and theres nothing i can do but die or run like a coward.<br />
<br />
Further, i KNOW cat dont work, been there done that ^^<br />
Ive tried starting in cat getting a couple of combopoints for a Rip, then switched caster, rejuv and root then travelform to get some distance. This has seemed to be a ok start for getting them bit lower on health/mana.<br />
From there ive tried rooting and casting and ive tried bearform. But it doesent matter.<br />
Either he resists my root and gets close enough to stun me, or he dispells my root and gets within stun range, this basically means im dead.<br />
In bearform im also dead, it just takes him a hit or two extra it seems =\</div></div><hr />

It used to be that Pally/Druid fights would take a long time so they just avoided it.  Could be many of the Belf Pallies are twinks for guilds that are trying to level them ASAP for endgame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uvgrin</div><div class="date">01-22-2007, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pally fights are normally long and boring. Chances are alot of BE pallies are pretty heavy twinked so you probably have a long uphill battle.<br />
At 60 I've just always stayed in bear you have to kill them 2-3 times normally depending if bubble is up. They're normally long fights so I avoid fighting them if I can. <br />
One of the good things abuot being a druid is our ability to run... so perhaps just run to grind somewhere else, you have track to just keep an eye out for him if you see him come around. Another option is find a buddy who's higher level and have him guard you... in stv that's normally the best option as lots of people like to gank in stv(except after the patch lots of people grinding I'm sure).</div></div><hr />

Is mangle really THAT good?<br />
I mean it'd hafta do insane stuff for killing a healing pally in plate armor that kills me in... id say less than 10 seconds in bearform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-23-2007, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, cat form gets it done at higher levels, as well as bear. I've tried both, and I've found if I alternate the two, using cat a lot, I can kill the pally faster than if I was just in bear. And yes, this was before I had mangle. It's not impossible, but it's challenging. Basically, you have to anticipate one thing: they heal.<br />
<br />
Here's how I usually do it, I mean, granted, now I can stunlock, so I've beaten pallies before they got me below 90% health, though I haven't dueled many lately. Anyway, I usually start up in cat. They'll consecrate, usually, but if you get good at timing AoE anticipation and enemy players, you can still get them. Use whichever starting attack you want. Hit them with a rake if you feel like it, and just keep attacking in cat. Their DPS isn't -the- highest, so you can afford to stay cat, imo. Hit them with a rip, so on. If they are dishing out a lot of damage, get to bear. <br />
<br />
Use bear as well. Why? At the lower levels, you have bash and feral charge (assuming you spec'd that). These two things will stop the pallies from healing. Now, this is where it gets tough. You may have stopped them, but they can get back at you. Basically, you have to burn them down ASAP (it may be a good idea to get 5 combo points, go to caster, heal up quickly, go bear, wear them down. When they heal, bash, cat form, ferocious bite). If you don't, well keep trying. They'll run out of mana usually faster than you, but if you run out first it's over.<br />
<br />
If they bubble up, go cat, run away a bit, and restealth. They get a full, uninterrupted heal. Why shouldn't you get another strike at them? Wait until the bubble wears off, then attack again.<br />
<br />
These are just rough strategies, and some may not agree about using cat. It's true they can stun you in cat and get you very low with a few attacks, if not kill you. If this happens, well, not every strategy is perfect. It's all about figuring out your opponent and learning for yourself.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to get a paladin your level from your faction to meet up with you, and duel, and duel, and duel. Duel some more. Practice makes perfect. You can't duel what you don't know. Ask him his weak points, ask him what screws him up, and so on. If you still have trouble killing pallies, take a friend along on quests.<br />
<br />
On a final note, cat form may not even be a good option at the lower levels. It's been a while since I've been there, so I can't really recall what I did back then. Honestly, I'd say your best option is to get a friend or practice off another pally.</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot, very informative post and ill give it a try in some duels. =)<br />
<br />
But for the cat not good in lower lvls, do u mean vs paladins or at all? Cos i find myself in catform 90% of the time while leveling and on encounters with opposing faction and come out on top 7 out of 10 times if its not a paladin. Bearform is for me a &quot;last resort&quot; option i use when i asspull or im getting low on health. Ive leveled from 20 to 38 almost only in catform and i love it, bearform is wayyyy to slow and i dont care if i take less dmg, when killing is slower. In cat i mash down 3-4 mobs drop to caster and rejuv then back to cat, lot faster imo. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-24-2007, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I meant versus paladins. Cat form is a very nice leveling form; I use it all the time, and it's by far my favorite form. <br />
<br />
But what I was trying to say is Cat is similar to a rogue, but not. It has leather-level armor, decent DPS (though not as great as a rogues until higher levels), but no &quot;stuns&quot; until level 62. Thus, it's not -the- PvP form, reason being rogues have stuns to complement their low armor--cat form does not really have this utility. <br />
<br />
As far as PvP goes, it all depends on the enemy class and the situation. In my opinion, it's bad to state &quot;always use this form versus this&quot; etc. We have 3 (technically 7, but you can only have a possible 6) forms for a reason, and we should use them to overcome our opponents. Honestly, it takes practice to be a good druid for PvP, but not so much PvE--soloing, at least; we're the kings of that, though hunters are arguably the best. You need to learn when to use what, and how to beat the enemy class, and you should always be ready to change what you're doing.<br />
<br />
So in summary, no, I meant cat form -may- not be the best choice versus a pally at a low level. Certainly use it for PvE, but don't only run around in Cat for PvP.</div></div><hr />

Ye im trying to be as druid as i can be, im shapeshifting like crazy using the form i find suitable for every situation.<br />
I try to make use of whatever skill i have at hand to get the upper hand, like root and hibernate.<br />
I do a 5cp rip on target b4 switching to caster, rejuv + root, get some distance, starshard then bear and finish them off. This is just an example of a situation when im facing a mob that hits hard and takes a good beating b4 dying (like a warrior). Thats why i love being a druid, versatility, not cos im king of one thing but i can do it all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-24-2007, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">starshard then bear and finish them off. <br />
<br />
Thats the NE priest racial.  You probably meant moonfire or starfire.  <br />
<br />
First thing, at lv 37 you don't have dire bear, so your armor isn't as high as it will be in 3 levels.  That will make the fights more managable.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Pally's dont get plate till 40 iirc, so they are wearing mail.  But yeah, a pally with SoC and a nasty 2h weapon will do a lot of damage.  <br />
<br />
Things will get better at lv 40.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our WSG assalt team, back in the days, consisted of yours truly and 2 spellordins (best pallys ever).<br />
<br />
Anyway.. only hard paladin for a feral is a spellordin (and a damn skilled one at that). Loladins and healordins are cake.. I shouldn't even have to explain why. ;)<br />
<br />
Loladins doesnt even make a dent in your health (seal of command isnt dangerous either - just time your heals). You can easy outlast a healordin even with feralgear due to your overall druidness.<br />
<br />
Imo that is.. long time since I PvP:d with the druid now.:p</div></div><hr />
