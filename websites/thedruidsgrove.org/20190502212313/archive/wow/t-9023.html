Anyone want to post what their guild is doing to down some of the MC bosses?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">06-29-2005, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Good Place to Start is with Conquests information.<br />
<br />
http://conquest.teamgbu.com/strats/moltencore/why.php<br />
<br />
It's not complete and it's not current but it's a good place to start.<br />
<br />
I would be shot if I posted our guild strats, but I can try to give some general information if you have specific questions.<br />
<br />
A few things that I know we do a bit differently than many guilds:<br />
<br />
We take advantage of multiple warriors and multiple warrior builds/equips.  Many guilds will have one MT and that tank will be the lead for all fights.  Our guild has tanks for defense, tanks for each resist type, tanks that are high HP and tanks that are high offense.  We use different tanks based on what we are fighting, with defense/FR being the most used in MC.  We also double tank many mobs so that resisted taunts are not as shattering to the raid.  <br />
<br />
We are a guild that was started by EQ Monks (regulars of the Monkly Business Community)  so Hunters ability to FD pull is respected.  95% of all our pulls in MC are done by our Hunters not our tanks, some not done by hunters are done by Ice Mages.  Most mobs are FD pulled but some are far distance pet pulled.  On multiple pulls each tank has a hunter assigned to FD pull their specific mob from the pack to the tank.   <br />
<br />
We rarely use heal rotations and never use innervate rotations.  We use a 3 teams of 2 percentage based rotation for Geh but as of most recently our first rotation of 3 shaman have never reached the point where they needed to be switched out.  We use a timed Greater Heal rotation with 3 priests on the MT for Rag.<br />
<br />
We fight almost all bosses in their spawn locations, the only exceptions are Baron and Shaz which are pet pulled to Garr's room.  <br />
<br />
Each guild will find the strategies that work best for them based off of available player strengths.  Each boss can be a stumbling block, you will get one boss down and everyone will cheer and be pumped up for the next only to hit a brick wall that may take you weeks to get over.  We currently have everything in MC on farm mode generally clearing everything in less than 5 hours, but there were times when the guild camped in MC at a specific mob and attempted that mob 5 hours a night until they got it figured out or were so broken and battered that they gave up for the week.  When you hit a stumbling block pay close attention to what is going wrong and work around or thru that.  If the MT is dieing is it because the MT is getting hit too hard, too often or that the healers are out of mana?  Why are the healers out of mana?  Why are the DPS dieing?  Break down every stage and fix it a step at a time.</div></div><hr />

Created and Originaly Posted by Emneri:<br />
<br />
In honor of Stehlen Life and the death of Ragnaros, we are now releasing a guide to all Molten Core bosses to try and help all guilds of Terenas attempt to conquer Molten Core.<br />
<br />
In this guide I will briefly describe the major spells of each boss, and how to counter them, and/or avoid them. Followed by a summary of positioning and Group set-ups.<br />
<br />
For maps and detailed descriptions of the trash mob encouters please visit: http://conquest.teamgbu.com/strats/moltencore/why.php<br />
<br />
# Lucifron:<br />
The first boss you will find in Molten Core is a Humanoid by the name of Lucifron, who has two adds with him.<br />
<br />
Major Spells of Lucifron:<br />
<br />
Impending Doom: AoE Magic De-buff much like call of the grave. 10 seconds to dispell everyone possible, or they receive an instant 2000~ damage.<br />
<br />
Lucifron's Curse: This curse will increase mana/rage/energy cost of all abilitys by 100%<br />
<br />
Lucifron’s adds also have a spell called Dominate Mind, much like a Priest version of Mind control. This can be dispelled by a Priests dispell, but CANNOT be dispelled by a Paladins cleanse since it only works on friendly targets.<br />
<br />
Lucifron Setup:<br />
Main tank will take position at the upper right side of the small spikes in the ground, with a small group of supporting casters who can decurse/dispell/heal and support the main tank till the two adds are taken care of.<br />
<br />
The two adds should be pulled by two Hunters with distract shot, followed up by two Warriors pulling agro from the hunters, and off tanking them back in the very very back of the cave. Assign a Priest to dispelling the Dominate Mind, and have everyone focus fire on one add, take it down, then the next.<br />
<br />
After the two adds are down, follow up with everyone moving up to Lucifron while NOT going near the left cave where the Imps/Surger is. From this point on, the curse and bomb should be dispelled from priests/druids ASAP, then dispelled from other classes. This fight is very very simple once you get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
# Magmadar:<br />
Farther down the cave you will see a two headed beast much like The Beast from UBRS by the name of Magmadar.<br />
<br />
Major Spells of Magmadar:<br />
Magmadar has a frontal cone shaped AE alot like Onyxia. It does low damage, and should only be hitting the main tank.<br />
<br />
Fire Spit: Magmadar &quot;spits&quot; globs of flame at the ground at a random group of people. If you are hit with it, you are afflicted with a DoT. This fire lasts for 45-60 seconds.<br />
<br />
AE Fear: Magmadar constantly fears throughout this fight, at a 30 second timer.<br />
<br />
Frenzy: This is the most important ability Magmadar has that needs to be taken care of. Magmadar will go &quot;into a killing frenzy&quot;. A visible emote alerts this. Hunters should then counter this with Tranquilizing shot, which drops from Lucifron.<br />
<br />
Magmadar setup:<br />
The main tank group should be perferably set up with a Dwarf Priest, for the fear ward. This makes the fight much easier since the main tank isn't getting feared. A Warlock should have an Imp placed in the middle near the main tank for Blood Pact.<br />
<br />
2 groups filled with pure DPS classes and a Priest should be formed for this fight. These two groups run around BEHIND Magmadar when the Main tank engages Magmadar. These two groups should have only 1 Priest, since these groups should not be taking much damage.<br />
<br />
This fight is all about Main Tank agro control. If the main tank can handle the agro, this fight is beyond easy. DPS tears him up from behind and from the sides, Mages and Warlocks blast him at max range, and that’s about all there is to this fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, Stehlen Life would open a portal to Stormwind, and run back to Molten Core as fast as possible as to avoid the Imps and Surger respawns.<br />
<br />
# Gehennas:<br />
Deeper into Molten Core is another Humanoid by the name of Gehennas, who also has two adds, much life Lucifron.<br />
<br />
Major Gehennas Spells:<br />
Gehennas’s Curse: AE Curse that lowers healing effects on the target by 75% (obviously a very very bad thing). This can be cured, and should be taken off the main tank ASAP.<br />
<br />
Shadow Bolt: This is a very hard hitting shadow bolt that can do on the high end of 2000~ damage. It hits a single target, but is on an RSTS(Random Secondary Targeting System) which means he will hit people randomly (so you can’t yell at someone who dies from this for getting agro).<br />
<br />
Rain of Fire: This is the worst of all of his spells. It is similar to the Warlock version, but does much more damage. This is a targeted AE, which means he will hit the largest group with it. Anyone caught in this AE should move out of it ASAP. Anyone caught in it for more than 8 seconds, and has less than 3500 hp will most likely be dead.<br />
<br />
Gehennas Setup:<br />
This is the same type of fight like Lucifron. Main tank support group, two warrior off tanks, with Hunters pulling the adds off and handing them to the Warriors.<br />
<br />
Pull the adds off, take one down with focused fire, then the next. Everyone should then move on to Gehennas, and focus fire on him, keeping the curse off of everyone. This is by far the easiest boss fight in the Molten Core.<br />
<br />
# Garr:<br />
A bit farther from Gehennas you will find an Elemental named Garr. This is one of the more complicated fights of Molten Core as he has 8, count them, 8 adds. This takes a skilled person to assign targets to people, but there are two ways to do it. We let our Hunter mark a target, then have our uber Warlock (Kongzer ^_^) go around the circle and assign targets to the groups, having each group /assist him. (I will get to the groups later) The other way I have heard of this being done is with a Priest doing Mind Vision around the circle, having people assist him/her as they mind vision around.<br />
<br />
His adds will explode when they are killed, dealing a little bit of damage, and doing a major knock back to everyone around it. You DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, want to kill all of the adds before Garr is killed because he will then go into a supreme mode, much like Kazzak’s. With this, we counter with Warlock Banish. I will discuss this later in the Garr Setup area. When there are 3 or less adds, Garr has the option of force-exploding one of them, dealing 3000~ damage to everyone around it, and you do NOT want this to happen. Thus keeping them banished, it shouldn’t happen.<br />
<br />
Major Garr Spells:<br />
<br />
AoE Slowing: He has an AoE Slowing aura, which really doesn’t effect anything major.<br />
<br />
AoE Buff dispelling: He has another type of aura that dispels random buffs on everyone around him every so many seconds. We used to get everyone buffed on the most useless buffs possible (water breathing etc etc). But anymore we just let the buffs get dispelled.<br />
<br />
Garr Setup:<br />
6 tanks, 5 with Hunters accompanying them. Hunters pull a single add they are assigned to (using the /assist command I mentioned above), then their Warrior tanking the add. Each group should have a priest/warrior/hunter combo so they can be self sufficient until 5 of the adds are taken down (the other 3 being banished). Another single group with 3-4 Warlocks and 1 Priest should be made. The Warlocks should bring out their Voidwalkers to tank the adds until they can re-cast banish, with the Priest in the group healing the Voidwalkers. The main tank grabs Garr, and takes him to the upper side of the circle, near the cave leading to Geddon and Shazzrah.<br />
<br />
The pull is basically a Paladin who runs in, poke Garr(not really), Divine Shield, Consecrate, and high tails it out of there.<br />
<br />
The raid goes through and focus fires on the adds, taking them down 1 by 1. The rest of them will be killed after Garr is killed. Everyone attacks Garr, keeping the main tank alive, and just easily killing Garr. Afterwards everyone goes to the banished adds, taking them out as they break banish. Yet another fairly easy fight once you get the hang of the adds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Down the cave and after the evil Flame Packs, you find Barron Geddon patrolling the halls, and Shazzrah sitting tight back in the corner.<br />
<br />
# Baron Geddon:<br />
Geddon is a very evil boss, with his living bomb and mana draining de-buff. Set groups up pretty much identical to the Gehennas fight, with each group able to hold its own for a short amount of time if needed.<br />
<br />
Major Geddon Spells:<br />
<br />
Inferno: Geddon periodically does this during this fight. It is an AoE based type of spell, which damages in pulses. Each pulse gets stronger in damage, and on the last pulse deals upwards of 2000~ damage. The main tank should probably (very heavily recommended) run away from Geddon when he does this.<br />
<br />
Ignite Mana: This is both an AoE RSTS, so it hits a lot of random people at the same time. It drains 400 mana, and deals 400 damage each tick, and should be dispelled ASAP from anyone who needs their mana. This debuff is harmless on warriors and rogues, so don’t waste mana dispelling it form them.<br />
<br />
Living Bomb: This is probably Geddons most annoying spell, along with his most powerful. He targets a random person (RSTS) and afflicts them with the Living Bomb. The target should then run away to the wall, being sure to stay away from everyone when it explodes. This spell does 2000+ damage on hit, followed by another 500~ falling damage. It can be countered by Paladin Divine Shield, and Mage Ice Block.<br />
<br />
Geddon Setup:<br />
The set up for this fight is a bit complicated. Each group (1-Cool should be positioned around the room Garr is in, in a circular fashion. Stay away from the wall (at least 20 yards) so that anyone who gets hit with the Living Bomb can run to the wall and not hit anyone else. The main tank will tank Geddon in the middle of the room, with an Imp planted in the middle for Blood Pact, much like the Magmadar fight. The key to his fight is being able to compensate and protect those who get hit with the Living Bomb, and keeping Ignite Mana off the healers. The main tank must also ALWAYS run from Inferno.<br />
<br />
# Shazzrah:<br />
Next up is Shazzrah. This is in my opinion the most annoying boss of Molten Core.<br />
<br />
Major Shazzrah Spells:<br />
<br />
High Arcane Resistance: Shazzrah is very very resistant to all Arcane spells.<br />
<br />
Blink: Shazzrah randomly blinks around from time to time.<br />
<br />
Shazzrah’s Curse: This curse increases damage taken from his spells by 100% This spell MUST MUST MUST be dispelled from everyone ASAP! If anyone gets hit with his Arcane explosion with this, they take an instant 2000~ damage.<br />
<br />
Arcane Explosion: This is basically exactly like the Mage version, and does around 1k damage per hit, or up to 2k with the debuff.<br />
<br />
Shazzrah’s Self Buff: Shazzrah has a self buff that decreases spell damage taken by 50%. This must be dispelled, or this fight can be very long, and will most likely end up in a wipe if it is not dispelled. It can be detected with detect magic, and has the icon of the Blessing of Salvation.<br />
<br />
Shazzrah Setup:<br />
Use the same groups from the Baron Geddon fight, and the same positioning. The only thing to be stressed about this fight is… When Shazzrah Blinks to one of the groups, the group must ALWAYS run TWORDS the main tank, so he can gain agro. Members of Stehlen Life cannot stress this enough. If anyone runs away from the tank, it basically wipes the group he blinked to. The faster the tank can get agro, the faster Shazzrah stops hitting everyone with his Arcane Explosion. Just keep the curse off people, and tear him up from a distance. Most melees sit this one out, and bandage nearby allies, doing whatever they can to help keep the raid alive.<br />
<br />
Farther down the lane, and over 5 Flame Packs later (ick) you’ll find Sulfuron, while also passing by Golemagg the Incinerator. We usually take out Sulfuron first, so we don’t have to go backwards.<br />
<br />
# Sulfuron Harbringer:<br />
So here we are at Sulfuron and his 4 Priest adds (and yes, they do heal each other and themselves).<br />
<br />
Sulfuron has no Major spells that really effect the raid, but the Priest adds have an evil Shadow Word: Pain that is 10x worse than the Player Controlled Priest, along with another nasty DoT, but these can be easily dispelled.<br />
<br />
Sulfuron Setup:<br />
Basically like the Lucifron fight, with Hunters that pull the adds to their Warriors. 4 Hunters, 4 Warriors (Paladins or Druids in Bear Form can replace one of the Warriors if you are short one). Hunters pull the Priests to the tanks, and pull each Priest as far away from each other as possible. Take down the Priests as fast as possible. Once the Priests are down, this fight is basically over. Go on to Sulfuron, and take him out. (Stehlen life sometimes unleashes our Pally football team with their Doomsaws on Sulfuron since its such an easy fight after the Priests are dead, even the Druids go in with cat form! ^_^)<br />
<br />
Note on add: The left most Priest has been discovered to heal himself. Counter this by saving him for last, and then use every single stun/spell interruption possible to take him down.<br />
<br />
Now on to Golemagg the Incinerator.<br />
<br />
<br />
# Golemagg the Incinerator:<br />
Golemagg is just a big endurance fight. Golemagg doesn’t hit terribly hard, but with his DoT stacking, the Main Tank hp spikes a lot. He also has two Core hound looking adds.<br />
<br />
Golemagg has no major spells, besides a small fireball he shoots at people (RSTS) and the effect that lowers the targets armor, and does DoT, but as it stacks, the timer does not get reset, so after the first time the main tank is hit, the timer starts ticking down.<br />
<br />
Golemagg setup:<br />
Two groups who can be self sufficient, usually a Priest, Druid, Paladin, Warrior, and another class will do, should be on the two core hound adds. Do NOT kill these adds, because they will just respawn the instant you kill them. The tanks on the dogs should only be doing enough things to keep agro, which should only be taunt and using normal attacks (since no one should be attacking them, and the only agro on the list will be healing), with an occasional sunder armor to keep the agro from the healers.<br />
<br />
As for Golemagg, its pure endurance like I said. Healers are able to drink up to 2 mana pots during this fight. Druids should be ready to Innervate if needed. This is a straight forward fight. Healers heal the main tank, drink pots the instant they will get the full effect, Mages cast, Hunters shoot (SL inside joke), and Rogues run up and tear him up. Like I said before, Main tank HP will spike a lot, but he should be ok with all the healers on him.<br />
<br />
Well folks, that’s about all for now. You’re now ready to take on Majordomo Executus. Officers of Stehlen Life would like to allow the players of Terenas to form their own strategy for Majordomo. I can say that Majordomo himself cannot be killed, and all you have to do is kill his adds. The Priests can be Sheeped, and after 4 of them are dead, Priests become immune to Sheep. The adds also have shields that come up. One is a damage shield, which makes them immune to melee damage for so long, and a Magic reflect shield, which reflects magic spells back at the caster.<br />
<br />
I hope this guide helps all players of Terenas. I am sorry for the horde if this does not help, as we are an Alliance guild, but hopefully this gives you the general idea of how to engage each boss. If you have any questions feel free to send any members of Stehlen Life a tell, and I’m sure they will be glad to answer it. Good luck with your adventures in Molten Core, and as always, have fun!</div></div><hr />

Here's a helpful video taken from Malus Lepus.<br />
Please watch this as we now trying to get Baron Geddon <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">10-14-2005, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Baron is pretty easy.  We pull Baron and Shaz into the same room.  One after we down the other.  Make sure to give the raid group room outside the circle to enable the living bomb person to run to so he doesnt take everyone around him out.  Druids should shapeshift when mana ignited until they are dispelled.  Locks should have felhunters our to devour mana ignite etc..  Pretty fun fight.  A lot of the people in my guild chat over ventrillo and we always bust on whoever the bomb is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taithos</div><div class="date">10-16-2005, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a line instead of a circle for Baron so that its easy to get the bomb out of the way. As long as the line stays in tact and the &quot;bombee&quot; is paying attention, there is never anyone killed except them if they have low hp.<br />
<br />
Its pretty hard not to know you're the bomb coz 39 people over Vent say &quot;Si you're the bomb!&quot;.\<br />
<br />
With Shaz, we don't have any bandagers, even melee uses bows/guns/throwing weapons. Quicker he goes down the better. Main things are detect magic, decursing and running the centre when agroed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed 100% Teamspeak has  been a key factor in getting us organized and getting many of these boss encounters learned and practiced.<br />
<br />
Heck I think Teamspeak helped us once take on Double Destroyers with 19 people and this was way before any of us had more then 1 or 2 peices of MC Gear. Some of the 19 had none.<br />

<br />
You will need to make some new macros, and some chat channels.  More importantly, people will have to pay attention and be disciplined - using raid channel only for important communication and keeping the channel clear otherwise, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Been just doing a lot of 5man BRD runs with my guild to get a feel for my new spec and tanking.  Vent really makes it easier to keep track of your stuff.  Pulls have much more coordination.  I've noticed that there is a lot less breaking of SAPs, Succubus stuns, and the like.  I also found it much easier to warn my group of pats and to switch strategy if something goes wrong.  I don't know if all that is Vent or if it is the guild, but coordination is insane.</div></div><hr />
