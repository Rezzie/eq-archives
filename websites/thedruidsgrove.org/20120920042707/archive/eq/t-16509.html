<br />
According to allakhazam's the rk3 is only 228 more points healed than skin of the reptile.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fuinniuil</div><div class="date">01-15-2008, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use this spell on the MT when we are about to fight a named, and every little bit helps, especially before the named is fully slowed and debuffed. Yes I also spam heal the MT in steamfactory on nameds, but this slightly increases my heal per second for those first few seconds before slow and debuffs land. <br />
<br />
 I also toss it on our puller sometimes to help him get back from a pull when he is going to be mostly out of range of heals.  <br />
<br />
It is rather expensive mana wise for the heal, so its a special case spell, not something I use on most mobs.<br />
<br />
Comparing it to the earlier viersion; its much easier to get, I dont have the 69 spell, so that is one plus.</div></div><hr />

[Sun Jan 13 15:56:46 2008] You begin casting Scales of the Reptile.<br />
[Sun Jan 13 15:58:12 2008] Your Scales of the Reptile spell has worn off of Hittem.<br />
<br />
the fight was two gods, tank was on sol ro. reptile lasted full duration without hitting its max procs (12). whoop-dee-doo. 1009 mana, may (or, as this shows, may not) proc a 731hp heal 12 times.<br />
<br />
sure, maybe its rng, but for me it happens like this a lot. no, this is not a spell that will ever see my spell bar again.<br />
<br />
as a replacement, i guess i'd have to recommend carrying Distillate of Celestial Healing XIII  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=35941). hand em out to your tanks before the fight begins.</div></div><hr />

Its more than cost effective especially with the vermiculated drape (25% mana reduction for this spell). On a lot of instances I almost don't have to heal when using reptile, I'm excited to try out the new one though I just hit level 79 and haven't used it yet.<br />
<br />
Its always on my healer spell set up.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The lvl 68 overwrites the Rk2 and the Rk2 overwrites the lvl 68. They are on different cast timers however, which is nice in a multi-tank situation.</div></div><hr />
