<br />
When I had about half of the DD Crit AAs, I was critting more than I do now with all of them.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this happen with them?  Anyone ever done a break down of the numbers on this so we can find out if it is broken?<br />
<br />
Before someone chimes in that it couldn't be broken, similar things have been broken in the past and after a long talk with Sony, Sony finally admitted and fixed the problems with other AAs.</div></div><hr />

You ask if anyone else has had this happen to them, then in the same breath, you tell people that before they say no...that you don't want to hear that.<br />
<br />
And its called bad luck with the RNG.<br />
<br />
<br />
And sow is going slower than normal.</div></div><hr />

If you say no, fine, run a quick parse, and let us know what you get.<br />
<br />
He didn't say &quot;Don't tell me it's not broken&quot;, he said, &quot;Before someone chimes in that it couldn't be broken&quot;.  That's not the same thing.<br />
<br />
And to be &quot;fair and balanced&quot; ;)  , Fanra, could you post your parses, so we can get an idea of what you're seeing now, and what you saw before you got the latest AAs?<br />
<br />
I'm curious to see what people have to say, since I still have a few AAs in the line to finish yet.<br />

If I spent a few hours searching through my logs, I guess I could come up with some numbers.  But I would really not want to do that.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, I suppose it could be the RNG.  But when you have been playing for weeks and noting how often you crit and then buy a few AAs and play a few more weeks and note that you are critting quite a bit less, you tend to feel it is something more.<br />
<br />
I am quite willing to hear from people who disagree with my opinion that it is broken.  I just didn't want my opinion dismissed as something impossible.<br />
<br />
Because it is possible and has happened in the past with other AAs.</div></div><hr />

I also tend to nuke a lot as we have a cleric that usually plays with our group so healing is taken care of.  Like I said not going to completely dismiss it, as i don't ahve parses from my crits now when compared to earlier (infact in general I'm too lazy to parse stuff) but I definately seem to hit somewhere aorund 1/3 of my nukes being crits, there are streaks of like 10-15nukes with no crits and then I get times with like 5 crits in a row, think u've just gotten the shaft by the RNG.</div></div><hr />

For a few minutes yesterday, I would have swore that I could only crit. My first 6 casts of Dawnstrike were crits, after that, back to normal. Of course, That doesn't happen too often.</div></div><hr />

Just &quot;eyeing&quot; your crit rate is not going to make myself or 99% of people here to stand up and lobby our crit rate %.<br />
<br />
A person would need an extensive parse of our nukes to get some kind of valuable information on our crit rate.</div></div><hr />

I was in HoH the other night and counted almost 50 successive casts of Sylvan Anger with no crits and thats with FoMM3. I was sure SoE had broken something but then I got a crit heal and things seemed to go back to normal.</div></div><hr />
