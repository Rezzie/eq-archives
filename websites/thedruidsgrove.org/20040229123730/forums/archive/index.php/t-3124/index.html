<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyotosuntsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I attended a PoG raid with my Druid a few weeks ago, and needless to say, he probably has some faction problems.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1. Is getting our Epic still possible?<br />
2. If it is indeed possible, how much factioning am I going to have to do and with what?<br />
3. Should I just forget about it cuz I screwed myself? :p   <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm pretty sure every faction is fixable except the actual Plane of Growth factions.<br />
<br />
There's some info on fixing factions for epic here:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, you're permascrewed out of Gloves of Earthcrafting and safe travel in PoG, but you can fix the rest of them by giving Pandos Flintside a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of muffins.<br />
<br />
Then give him more muffins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kyotosuntsu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A little update for people that may be in the same boat as I am, I turned in almost 3000 muffins last night and I am up to dubious from Max KOS. I also spent about 45 minutes in crushbone as a diversion from all that clicking. Anyhow, the end result was about three hours of work, I guess it will take about three more to get to max Ally from this point.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deneldor2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suspect it wouldnt take you anything like that long to do the rest as KoS to dub is way over half the total faction base iirc. Maybe half the time again and you should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RetlawEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just hate how you can't do turnins in 4 stacks of 4 items still :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Althea Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lead many pog raids long ago, and from this, my faction was totally hosed. I was not even able to get near the muffin man to do turn-ins, so those that can get near../cheer.<br />
<br />
I eventually had a GM wipe my faction and started with a clean slate for epic, again, this was WELL over a year and a half ago, possibly longer than that. Well, when all servers still had actual customer service.../sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stumps  Mistrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I see you are a Karana worshipper..If you are a halfling, just sneak. I MQ'd VSR piece for a friend max KOS. Just go invis, wait till you get sneak to actually stick, then click off invis, con mob, do turn in.</div></div><hr />
