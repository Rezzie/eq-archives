BFD is for both factions, Kelris is killable by both factions.  But you wouldn't be using it at level 17 either way.<br />
<br />
If you want a cross faction comparision of low level staffs that don't compare very well look at Crescent Staff (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2803) VS Staff of Westfall (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=2273) Both are quest rewards for level 20ish quests.  <br />
<br />
As for load times and lag it really depends on which server and the server population.</div></div><hr />

Funny, I felt the same way after rolling 2 Horde toons and trying Alliance for a change.<br />
<br />
You may chalk some of that up to the fact that rolling a toon in general kind of makes rolling your next one a bit easier. A WoW Quest is a WoW Quest is a WoW Quest.<br />
<br />
You should have Wailing Caverns next and that gives you the Crescent Staff as a reward.<br />
<br />
I don't really think uber weapons are all that valuable pre-level 40 anyway.<br />
<br />
I had both the Illusionary Rod and Mograine's Might for a very long time, both are awesome weapons. Plus Scarlet Monastery gives you like 3-4 levels worth of XP alone.<br />
<br />
Give it a few more levels, it gets more interesting.<br />
<br />
How do you like that Barrens Chat?</div></div><hr />

I did WC an hour or 2 into it, so I could finish the quest that you have to kill the 4 types of guys, for some idiot npc in the WC.... No clue where HE is.<br />
<br />
If you happen to be on azjol I could really use a little help finding the staff quest.<br />
<br />

I usually don't hang in barrens.  I'm running with lvl 40s into elf towns near the BG instance getting my HKs up. =)  Level 17 Scout, gogo!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are a bit tricky to locate... you have to climb up the back of the hill, and drop down into the right eye socket above the WC entrance.</div></div><hr />

Easy - Go to Crossroads.  Near the south gate is a Tauren Male quest giver.  He starts the chain.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 - find Forgotten Oasis (NW of crossroads)<br />
Quest 2 - Investigate another Oasis (SE of crossroads) and plant a seed given you <br />
Quest 3 - Go back and kill turtles in same oasis - drop rate near 100 percent<br />
Quest 4 - Take sample to Thunderbluff (Elder Rise and the Archdruid)<br />
Quest 5 - Talk to other NPC on Elder Rise - she is near the tent entrance<br />
Quest 6 - Druids of the Fang - kill the 4 evil druids in WC and loot the Gem from each - return to receive reward</div></div><hr />

I was killing turtles and I noticed my friend sitting next to me playing an MC run.  Which was funny they had a pickup group with like 8 clans and wiped 5x on just the molten giants up to the first boss.  I decided to make a priest(ess) as frostmane has NONE.  He set me up with like 50 gold and plenty of int/spi greens!!!  Some I can even switch to fluffy when I bring him over.<br />
<br />
And I never would have been on if I hadn't thought to post here. =)</div></div><hr />

Dude, you're a druid.  When you hit 60ish you can ride the tram all you want, I know my tauren does, and trust me after a few rides it gets old.</div></div><hr />
