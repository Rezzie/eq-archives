We were all little druids once, and I seriously doubt anyone has always been considered top druid on their server.  And so it follows that we all have (or have had) druidic heroes.<br />
<br />
Who was your hero when you were a little druid? :&gt;<br />
<br />
Mine was a feral druid called Mukharn, his deeds were legendary and one time I even saw him!  He had a less-well-known sidekick called Frezzer and the 2 of them cultivated such a reputation that they were known server-wide even on the opposing faction.<br />

I was just a wee little HoT-Bot but it started me thinking that Feral could be fun.<br />

Now, 2 years later.....I love being a fuzzy sponge.</div></div><hr />

I was thrilled to see that he was on my server, and put him on my friends list so I could follow his progression when I logged on. Whenever I saw him I would inspect him just to see what kind of gear I should be striving for (still do). I even got him to craft me a helm once- the one that gives you rage/energy when you shift into forms (BTW, I think Blizz is remiss in not revisiting this theme. What a great druid-specific piece of gear. I would love one with an iLevel of 120 or higher.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's to Kyane and all our other druid hewoes out there!:beerchug:</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I never went to the website or anything when I first got WoW, and I literally did NOT meet a SINGLE druid IN-GAME until 30. :(<br />
 <br />
Except for two Nelf druids I met in WSG at 29.  They kept ganging up on me...  &gt;_&gt;<br />

Ferahgo and Boro's PvP video (which is pre feral buff patch so pre 1.8 iirc). Really amazing stuff in that video. I think it's called 'Never'.<br />
<br />
And there's also like one's on my server I've always looked up to, asking questions and becoming friends (Jodas from Ropetown (executus), Atala (executus), and Apostasy (executus) and Zoltarc (who's quit now I think).<br />
<br />
Oh and last but not least, I'm sure he's taught every druid the druid spirit .... ALAMO! =D</div></div><hr />
