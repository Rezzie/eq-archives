I've been Restore then Dreamstate for all of my Druid life. Now I'm thinking of tanking, haven't been a tank in awhile, since I played EQ actually. I have no idea where to get some easy blues for tanking. Any suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you insist on trying to gear before WotLK, I would say start with the Heavy Clefthoof set (Chest/Legs/Boots)  Easy AH pickups if anyone is still making them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think I'll be picking up WotLK the first week it's out cause I hate standing on lines and haven't reserved it anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Some of the early tanking pieces you might find in the Expansion will probably easily surpass what blues you could get now.<br />
<br />
But, if you're wanting to try your hand at tanking...<br />
<br />
If you know a LW, check for Stylin' Purple Hat, Heavy Clefthoof Legs/Chest/boots.  Those are easy pickups if you can trade for mats (or check the AH).  There are some quest rewards at 70 that give you additional pieces...Check this site out (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/04/15/shifting-perspectives-gearing-your-bear-tank-from-70-to-karazha/) for more ideas.  It really helped me a lot...I started building my starter tanking set and easily OT'd in Kara with only a very few of those items.</div></div><hr />

I walked into Target.  Picked up my copy off of the hundreds of extra copies laying around..  Went to the normal check out... paid for it and went home and installed.  <br />
<br />
True story.  Walmart, Target, or your favorite big store will have TONS of extras and no &quot;line&quot; to buy them if you live in the US.</div></div><hr />

Agreed!  I really wish they would have just made the expac downloadable like TBC is now.  Save the box, the fancy instructions...etc.  Give me the file and save us both some time and effort!</div></div><hr />
