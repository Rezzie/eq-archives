<br />
What in the name of holy tunare are you fuggin thinking?  If I am raiding the last thing I want is for my freshly rezzed behind to get spanked because I get low health aggro.  <br />
<br />
Why can't you find a normal camp spot like the rest of the populace?  Kiting in the graveyard is just plain &lt;strong&gt;RUDE&lt;/strong&gt;.  <br />
<br />
I find it amusing that graveyard kiters get upset when someone will dispell their mobs, or even go so far as to train them in the graveyard.  While I have not done this yet it does sound tempting but I would rather not have a mark on my account.<br />
<br />
If you are in the GY kiting, just don't, its rude and uncalled for.  If someone does smack you back for it, suck it up and walk away the bigger man (or halfling).</div></div><hr />

Well I have seen many a druid kite the two entrance mobs in HoH, sometimes aggro kiting with a rogue/dps partner.  Thats one of the few things that really piss me off in pop.  There are many camps to take up in HoH, but if you never try something new your never gonna know.<br />

BTW this isn't directed towards any one class in particular just I see this happening often and it just makes my blood pressure rise and me get in mah fighting mood *turns on headstrong*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Player Etiquette designates that you should not kite the graveyard while someone is cleaning up - but other than that I see no problem with it. People kite in HoH graveyard because its probably the easiest spot in the zone to do it. The only other areas for it are in the trials rooms and a lot of people don't go there becuase they haven't realized you can get past the see invis white guard that guards the ramp by casting harmony on him (hint...hint...). Once you are in the trials area you will get Sentry pops - these mobs are unsnareable so they are a pain in the ass and no one kills them solo. Sooner or later you've got Sentry's on top of all the spawn points.<br />
<br />
Even so... HoH exp is comepletely worthless and I can't understand the people who solo there :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only other solo spots, PoStorms = super contested, PoTactics = too laggy and contested and dangerous, PoFire = lag city...  so...<br />

The 3 corpses in the GY and the 8 people in the zone don't really seem to care much. <br />
<br />
I wish there was a corresponding open space on the other opposite side of ZI, that was like the spot around the GY. Mostly what I've seen is folks who are just learning the zone kiting in the GY there, then moving on to other camps. As far as why people hunt there? Parchments, is the answer I hear most often. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accretion</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep I think HoH is an exception to the rule.  I must admit the first time I ever went there I joined a group that was aggro kiting the huge open area adjacent to the ZI.  I didn't notice any bodies at the time so didn't really think anything of it.  After about 30 mins, I noticed 2-3 bodies lying around.  Hmm....  I finally realized it was the GY when a cleric came thru and zapped a couple of folks and gave us a dirty look.  However, with 12 folks in the whole zone and a ton of room to maneuver, I think you'd have to be pretty careless to get killed there upon rezzing.<br />

True that they are a pain in the ass to solo, but with an affliction haste 3 item i am able to take them down just fine, no adds, and avoid being hit.<br />

Some momo druid (would figure druids would be smarter then this) is kiting mobs in GY, I egress from NR camp because I went LD when medding in room and came back later to find it camped.  So as the zone is reloading I go get a drink come back to find that I was spanked to druid-pancake because a silly druid was kiting in the GY....<br />
<br />
Second Night I was grouped with an enchanter and wizard, they had to evac and the enchanter gets close to smoked because she was low on health and the mob automagically started spanking her instead of chasing the necro around.....<br />
<br />
So lets say I decide to teach these b00bs a lesson with the nifty annul button, any repercussions you can think of?</div></div><hr />

Now, I know it's possible to kite near a GY and control your mobs with minimal annoyance to others, but most people aren't skilled or just don't care who they inconvenience.<br />
<br />
1) In Halls of Honor - I succored group, we were sitting there medding up and waiting for rez of Enchanter. (Nobody was around, so we figured it would be OK. WRONG!) In comes a Druid, and stands right next to the group to pull a guardian. She roots her mob directly in front of us. We move, but we're all on the hate list now because it was practically on top of us. Her root breaks, mob comes and starts whacking me, I almost die. Other Druid manages to regain aggro and takes it to the very back of the GY, so we thought we were ok to rez, med up and run back. Of course she died a minute later, so her mob wanted to come play with us again.<br />
<br />
2) Same day, Halls of Honor - Group succors, gets whacked by a GY kiting druid's mob. They complain about the Druid in /ooc saying (rightly, although I'd do tells before /ooc) that it's really rude to pull mobs directly over the Succor point of a zone. Druid: &quot;Well I suggest you move, kk thx.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why should THEY move? They succored.<br />
<br />
3) Back in the day in PoNightmare - my group wipes deep in the hobgob caves, so it's a Graveyard corpse recovery. In comes a Druid kiting mobs back and forth in the GY. She roots a spider - &lt;em&gt;on top of my corpse, right after our cleric finished casting rez on it&lt;/em&gt;. She also has the nerve to ask us for a rez after she gets spanked. Yeah, we'll get right on that, babe. :lol:</div></div><hr />

In E'ci HoHa GY kiting is quite common, 2 groups are there all the time AGRO kiting. PoS ent frogs also is a very common practice. I've done these 2 camps and i have never agroed someone on CR. <br />
<br />
PoS frogs are non-kos and HoHa GY is quite large, the only one I feel would be aproblem is HoHa but if the druid/necro is kiting far from the corpses it's no problem at all really.</div></div><hr />

Before there were TONS of camp spots for solo and groups, there was an aggro kite group and a few chanters and druids soloing in the crypts.  It was only after the recent flag removal that others started hunting in HOH.  It was rare that there was an exception to this fact.  Because you now want to hunt there doesn't grant you the authority to redefine the legitimate camps in the zone.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it is great that pet classes and bards have a camp that best suits their skills without them having to solo. Futhermore, I think it is great that the aggro kite groups can be formed without the concern about whether or not the hit point buffs or healing is adequate.  I think it sucks that now traditional groups are pulling the same mobs to zoneline and reducing the efficiency and enjoyment of one of the few non-traditional group camps in PoP.<br />
<br />
I agree that isn't nice to pull and kite over the actual corpses as they are being rezzed, but most of the /ooc whining is from those who are mustering in the graveyard before they venture out to their traditional camp.   I do and have for a long time participated in aggro kiting groups and have always asked the kiter to kite behind the tree when people are being rezzed.  Not once have I ever seen a rezzed person killed by an aggro kite pull (not that it hasn't happened for others), but I have frequently seen noobs to the zone get smacked down by the mobs for engaging them in one way or the other.<br />

Frustrated?  Not in the least.  Someone like you starts casting on our pulls, I move close to them &lt;/report &lt;em&gt;Jackass&lt;/em&gt;&gt;, back off pets and cast mem blur on the mob and watch it with glee as it chases the jerk out of the zone.  <br />

<br />
Willfully cause harm?  Pardon me Miss but kiting over fresh dead with KoS mobs is kind of the same thing.  Aggro is NEVER 100% contained on a mob EVER.  You can have a somewhat solid aggro but it won't ever prevent someone from jumping right up on that hate list.<br />
<br />
Most of the respectable guilds on my server don't kite in or near the GY's in the upper tier zones because they all have had 'gentlemens agreements' that GY kiters are teh suck and they need to be dealt with accordingly.  If they are unguilded you hit the annul button(only if gentlemens talks dont succeed), if they are guilded you talk to the guild leader/officer about their members behaivor and walla walla, problem solved.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am just a crafty druid who can handle tight spaces to kite around in.  Or one who refused to kite in the GY because I don't want to be known as the a$$hole who kills people from kiting in the GY.<br />
<br />
So pop a cork in it and go continue to kite in the GY (since you obviously are all for it) but when you start getting smoked cuz someone is annulling your mobs dont go bitching to anyone, keke?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolodo</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also have aggro kited in the gy with no problems at all and will continue to do so.  I have never killed anyone in the gy newly rezzed or just mustering forces.  I always kite behind the tree and never pull if I see rezzing going on.<br />
<br />
It is accepted that the gy in HoH is an exception to the gy kiting rule you speak of.  Why would it have been made so big of an area if it wasn't designed with this in mind.  I can't think of a reason.<br />
<br />
Tons of camps to go to in HoH????  Not on my server.  HoH basement camps and others that we could possibly solo are always camped by groups.  I prefer to go in deeper if one of the camps are open but the majority of the time they are not.<br />
<br />
What I find ridiculous are the full groups that set up camp right at zone in and fight there.  Why do they not go to one of these &quot;tons of camps&quot; you speak of? <br />
<br />
I have went in the basement and root/rotted only to get into hassles with people that have full group that want my camp saying I am wasting it, why don't I go aggro kite in gy instead of taking a camp designed for groups.  <br />
<br />
Granted I will always move in further in the zone if its available, but if not I will aggro kite or root/rot in gy.  If you are aware of whats going on around you in gy it will not be a problem.  I will usually cast snare 2-3 times along with Immolation of Ro.  I will then cast one nuke to top off all the aggro I have now built up.  I then do the sit stand move back sit again to keep mobs attention until it is past tree if people are in gy.  Again, I never pull if people are rezzing and I never pull across where corpses pop just in case of evacs popping in.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have had dealings with idiots that don't care vs a skilled druid that can kite gy easily without problems.  I have found those kind in every zone.  <br />
<br />
<br />

I don't usually respond to these type of posts but I am one of those gy kiters that you speak of.  The &quot;Grow some fuggin balls and camp in the basements&quot; statement got to me.  I don't camp the gy because its safe and I can easily zone out if in trouble.  I camp it because its the only spot available.  My dying skill is capped at 252 and I have no fear of going to the more risky camps.  As a matter of fact I love the dangerous camps no one else wants.<br />
<br />
 I will repeat, I have never killed anyone in HoH gy and see many Druids, SKs, Necros, Bards, Rangers, and even Warriors doing the aggro kite shuffle in HoH gy.  It was designed for this!  You don't put DCable mobs at zone-in and not forsee this being done.  How many other zones do you see with such a HUGE area for gy perfectly designed for aggro kiting?<br />

<br />
because raiders and the NEED for raiding have removed a lot of the enjoyment i used to have for the game when it was all about 6 person groups.  so i have as much respect for them as they all seem to have(and those of you raiders here on the druids grove seem) for me and the rest of my non-raiding brethren.<br />
<br />
you don't like it?  /shrug.  there are things that you guys do that i don't like and last time i checked, there is no bannable offense for kiting in the GY or overpulling so you have to succor out.  so sorry.  i would say, that won't happen again, but ill tell ya, next time i see an uber guild standing nekkid and assembling in the GY for a CR, its train to GY time.  WOOT.</div></div><hr />

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Why would it have been made so big of an area if it wasn't designed with this in mind. I can't think of a reason.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Maybe....just maybe they made it so big so people could sit FAR back in the GY where you kiters do your thing so they could patiently sit LFG.</div></div><hr />

I am gonna guess because you have mommy's credit card and you don't care whether your account gets banned?  Oh and BTW intentionally pulling mass mobs and &lt;strong&gt;training&lt;/strong&gt; the GY area why a CR is happening is something you can at least get a mark on your account for.  Get caught 3 times and I am sure you will get a big fat bancake for breakfast.  <br />
<br />
Trust me, most GMs would do something if 50+ people petition on the same person for doing something like this.</div></div><hr />

Pardon me Miss but kiting over fresh dead with KoS mobs is kind of the same thing. Aggro is NEVER 100% contained on a mob EVER. You can have a somewhat solid aggro but it won't ever prevent someone from jumping right up on that hate list.[/quote]<br />
Debate is two way. Please read my post before you start rebutting it.<br />

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Grow some fuggin balls and camp in the basements.... you can aggro kite there as well. No need to camp the fuggin graveyard of all places.[/quote]<br />
I have solo'd the basements and there is just too much downtime.  There is no reason for you think I'm ballsy though because it wasn't too difficult.  Oh,  did I ask you where I should camp?  I didn't think so.<br />
<br />
The truth is you just recently started camping in HoH and you wnt to change the behavior of those who there before you.  You say you have had access for 4-6 months, but you obviously didn't have the &quot;fuggin balls&quot; to hunt there until recently.  If the truth was otherwise, you wouldn't be whining about it now.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if undestand your post because I can't be sure we speak the same language or if it is simply a generation or two gap.  &quot;teh suck&quot;, &quot;keke&quot;</div></div><hr />

I would like morons to discontinue kiting in the graveyard, will it happen?  Probably not, why?  Because it typically is &lt;strong&gt;the safest&lt;/strong&gt; location in the zone because the zone out tends to be rather close to it.<br />
<br />
I remember the good ol days in HoH where there were a few chanters, a wizzy, and the odd druid hanging out in there doing the basement camps.  I never saw anyone kiting in the graveyard, if someone was the rest of the zone started to /ooc comments about where else to camp etc.  Most of the time they would move to one of the basement locations, but certain asshats still like to kite in graveyards.<br />
<br />
I feel I have stated my same point over and over, GY kiters who kite with KoS mobs just plain suck.  There is no need for it, just remember if you piss someone off doing it that your probably going to end up with half the zone in the graveyard and someone walking away from your corpse with a big grin (as I would do).<br />
<br />
But this alll doesn't affect me too much any longer as I have 4 new zones to explore and xp in.  So have fun kiting in the GY all you want, just dont bitch when someone decides to teach you a harsh lesson.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I was flagged for HoHb I would hunt there, but unfortunately I don't belong to a guild that is capable of getting that flag.  Thats ok with me because my guild will get there soon.<br />
<br />
Some posters on this board assume we all are in guilds that can get us all our flags so we can go to all these other zones.  I wish that was the case.  <br />
<br />
What it does is narrow my choices to hunt in.  HoH happens to be a tier 3 zone which I will continue to hunt in as I grind out my AA.  If no camps are available I will continue to aggro kite in the gy regardless if you think it is ok or not!  <br />
<br />
As I said in my previous post, HoH gy is an exception to the rule.  I do not kite or even fight near any other gy in PoP.  Sorry you had some bad experiences with others kiting there.  But it does not give you the right to come here and start putting those of us down that do aggro kite there in a RESPONSIBLE way.<br />

in every single interaction i have had with the GMs, they have always said if they don't see it, it didnt happen.  /shrug.  if this changes, then everything i have ever said about GMs favoring the uber guilds will have been totally confirmed.  besides, i can say anything i like on these boards and there is nothing Sony or their little GMs can do about it.  and even if i do this, and someone does send a link to the GMs, i have a perfectly valid excuse.  my pull got nasty and i ran to the GY to give myself room to egress...soooo sorry all those fellas from &lt;insert cockblocking uberguild name here&gt; got whiped out while waiting for their corpses to spawn.  sooooo sad.</div></div><hr />
