<br />
I am a feral tank druid and seeing the new wotlk professions i am not sure what to do/keep.   At the moment i am leatherworker and skinning but i am thinking perhaps inscribing and herablism.<br />
Skinning gives me i think .45 crit chance and leatherworkering gives me bop leg and wrist i think enchants.<br />
Now herablism does a 2k heal over 15seconds with a 3min cooldown i belive.   And if i drop leatherworking or skinning i would want to drop both so i don't have to buy mats. <br />
What do you guys think are the best professions for feral tank druids?<br />
Wow just looked at those BOP JC gems those are nice also heh.. what do you guys think?   The stat increase is nice plus they match any socket..hmm<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

All of the professions have something for you at the top end.  I still stick with my mining and Jewelcrafting.  I don't think its been as sexy as some of the others in terms of what I can get, but the Unique equipped top end gems are fantastic.  Sure I can't stack 4 x 18STA gems, but even one is a lot of HP and cheap as hell for me to make compared with everyone else.  If you like Skinning and LW, I wouldn't dump it.  We haven't seen all the profession stuff yet.</div></div><hr />

I feel it has been a really useless profression for me.   Just wondering what professions would be best for a feral tank but i guess you are right we should just wait and see then go from there just thought i could get a head start.<br />

Thanks for your help =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've been able to make a couple of nice items for myself with it. 1 was BoP so no other chance to get it. and i'ts been nice buying some patterns for good gear knowing i wont get a chance of the top end gear given i dont raid.<br />
<br />
i've made stuff like<br />
<br />
Boots of Natural Grace<br />
Swiftstrike Shoulders<br />
some epic healing head<br />
<br />
i'll certainly be taking a close look at inscription though.</div></div><hr />

I look on the new bonus stuff for the different professions as just a bonus; I wouldn't trade herb/alch for the world, it's just too awesome being able to churn out a constant supply of drugs.  :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-04-2008, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm enchanting alchemy.... I dropped herb on my druid way back pre bc to make the Smoking Heart of the Mountain, as it was (along with the mark of tyrany) the druid tanking trinket... I do miss having a gathering profession, and was thinking of going back to herbalism...  What's this about a 2k heal for herbalists? Is it like the buffs we get now from picking certain herbs?  And anything cool coming for Alchemy?  Not sure whether to keep it... though re-leveling a profession doesn't seem that appealing atm<br />
 <br />
Enchanting hasn't really helped me much with making money thus far, but it's been nice to put stats on my feral rings and +healing on my reto rings, not to mention de'ing old blues and whatnot. I haven't seen anything about enchanting in wotlk, but after all the gold and time and headaches that I spent leveling it (rods are ridiculous) I can't imagine dropping it. Anyone have any links / know anything about enchanters in wotlk?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-05-2008, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dropped skinning many many moons ago in order to be able to make the Smoking Heart of the Mountain in the good old days pre bc.<br />
<br />
then i dropped enchanting last year as i found it was not making me any money. luckily a guildy de's all my blues and greens.<br />
<br />
i'd like to understand more about inscription and how it will benefit me if i am NOT an inscripter.<br />
<br />
also i'm hoping there will be some nice leather patterns to make me want to keep LW.  but gotta hope there are enough nice patterns that are not BoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-05-2008, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's nice to be able to DE my soulbound blues / epics rather than selling them for a few gold.  Though that in and by itself is no justification for the profession.  I've made a good amount of gold off of Executioner and +40 dmg enchants now that people are constantly getting new weapons (especially at the beginning of each new arena season).  Thought thats only like 5 to 15g tips here and there.  Main benefit is an additional 8 stats or +40 healing or +24 dmg.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunat</div><div class="date">09-07-2008, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes each profession will get self only perks.<br />
<br />
http://wotlkwiki.info/index.php/Professions<br />
<br />
Trying to decide which profession has the best perks for feral tank druids..   I doubt we will use the recipies for long.. so i want to know whats going to be the best in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-08-2008, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just bear in mind that you won't know which one is best right away.  First you won't be able to see all of the recipes available because some aren't in the game yet.  The perks are nice, but just that... perks.  Not meant to be something that makes you go OMG that's just totally broken for a Druid tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunat</div><div class="date">09-08-2008, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iam not looking for a OMG one i was jut wondering if these are how the perks are going which do you think would help more.<br />
<br />
For example does .50% crit chance and 25stamina make up a <br />
2000 hot every 3mins and also have a extra major glyph.   Hmmm i think i will just wait till the expansion comes out and see if the recicpies make a difference.  <br />
