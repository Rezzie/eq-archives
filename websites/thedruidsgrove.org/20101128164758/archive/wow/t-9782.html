<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-23-2005, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest to obtain Bear Form begins with Turak Runetotem, at the Elder Rise in Thunder Bluff (tloc is 76,27 if you have a map addon installed).  Turak teaches you the Teleport: Moonglade spell, and sends you to talk to Dendrite Starblaze in Nighthaven.  You can also see Turak's location on the attached Thunder Bluff map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=147).<br />
<br />
Dendrite is in the building just north of the location you port in to (56,30), on the second floor.  Dendrite sends you to talk to the Great Bear Spirit, which is just northwest of Nighthaven (39,27).  You can find both these locations on the attached Moonglade map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=146) -- the red dot is Dendrite, and the green dot is the Bear Spirit.<br />
<br />
After talking to the Great Bear Spirit, return to Dendrite.  He'll send you back to Turak in Thunder Bluff.  At this point, you can either hearthstone back, or talk to the Flight Master in the southwest part of Nighthaven (44,45) to get a ride back.  The Flight Master is the blue dot on the Moonglade map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=146).<br />
<br />
Turak will then send you to defeat Lunaclaw, near Mulgore in the Barrens.  Seek out the Moonkin Stone in the Barrens (41,60), then use the Cenarion Lunardust Turak gave you to summon Lunaclaw.  Be prepared; Lunaclaw ranges from level 12 to level 13, so you might want to bring a friend to help!  Lunaclaw is marked on the attached Barrens map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=145).<br />
<br />
After killing Lunaclaw, talk to the Lunaclaw Spirit, then return to Turak in Thunder Bluff.  Turak will then teach you the Bear Form ability.<br />

Whew!  Enough running around for now.</div></div><hr />

You might try petitioning a GM about it.</div></div><hr />

Does it have horns? like a tauren? or does not not have horns? Like a night elf?  And what faction are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cerimbor</div><div class="date">11-19-2006, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">or anybody, who can help me with this tiny small problem. I am playing Tauren Druid, lv. 18 already, and still not having Bear form shapeshifting, because that stupid animal with soothing voice is killing me instantly as I approach.. Just hits me, does not even have an exclamation mark over its head, just that gold quest point is showing on minimap... Please, can you help me?<br />
<br />
Oh, sorry, as I read everything above, I am not at war, not at PvP server, rep. is as high as it should be, and there is only ONE bear in this location...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">11-19-2006, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strange... I don't understand why he would be aggressive.<br />
<br />
I checked this out, and went up to him with my Tauren druid just now... he was yellow, no sword icon, and right-clicking on him, he talked to me.<br />
<br />
I've attached a screenshot with his location just in case there's a different bear...<br />
<br />
If you're still having this problem, I recommend either bugging it in game, or posting it on the official forums in the bug forum.</div></div><hr />

No. I am level 60 and I can still see the bear.</div></div><hr />
