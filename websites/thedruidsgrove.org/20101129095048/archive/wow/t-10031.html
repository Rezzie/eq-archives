My boyfriend has a 52 NE Rogue and went the Tribal LW route (the guild he was in at one point kinda asked him to do that and I think even gave him a pattern or two).  Is Elemental LW any good for Druids?  Right now I am feral spec....not sure if that will change or not.<br />
<br />
I don't want to choose Tribal also, since he will help me out with making any Tribal pieces I need.</div></div><hr />

The items produced tend to be more focused for specific events or playstyles than Tribal (i.e. the Living leg/shoulders/breastplate  set are +healing, the volcanic set is +fire resists).  Elemental LW is considered to be more expensive than Tribal since you will either need to pay AH prices for rare drop materials or spend a lot of time farming the materials (i.e. essence of air/water/earth drop from 50+ elementals in silithus/EPL/Azsharra, lava cores drop in MC).</div></div><hr />

Sounds like I have a winner with Elemental LW then.  I just wasn't sure what the sets did....if anything to help druids.</div></div><hr />

Elementals epic cloak is Shifting Cloak which is nice for any melee.  Also with Thorium Brotherhood rep you can make Molten Belt/Helm.</div></div><hr />

It will probably be a while before I play Hyu right now....busy working on getting Tsu (Priest) to 60 (53...and lots of rest xp).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Oops ... I just saw your sig. Alliance I have no idea where the guy is.<br />
Edit2: I just remembered runing past an alliance guy once in searing gorge. Just before you enter the stepps turn left and go east along the ridge ... hes on the road there but im not sure if hes the LW.<br />
Edit3: When I mean stepps I mean stepps to the Blackrock Mountain entrance.</div></div><hr />
