What is the best class for soloing? I don't know anyone that plays so I would just be soloing to check out a different game. Sometimes I only have 30-60 mins to do something, and EQ doesn't cut it there. I know this is the Druid forum, but I can't post on the WoW boards since I don't have a character yet. I was looking at a Troll Rogue, but I have no clue on anything about WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters &amp; Locks have pets that make it that much easier.<br />
<br />
All the solo'ing really starts to become viable as you hit lvl 10, locks get void walkers, druids get bear, hunters get a pet and rogues....umm...get something ( I can't remember ).</div></div><hr />

 <br />
So, the consensus is that Warloks or Hunters are the best for soloing? Has anyone had any experience with a WoW Rogue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">10-03-2006, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">rouges are fun deals a lot of damage quick and can stealth. One of the best thing about being a druid however is you can heal yourself during combat.</div></div><hr />

Both disagree with the best solo class. One says Hunter, while the other says Warrior. But they did say that you die a lot more in WoW than in EQ, how truthful do you find this statement?<br />
 <br />
Guess I need to create a few characters. /sigh</div></div><hr />

I felt the same way, but in the end... I couldn't deny my innate druidness. I found rogues to be the most fun alt, but after 5 years of playing a druid in EQ, some old habits die hard - like running through camps and stopping to heal when they're all beating you up. Even priests can't take a whoopin' like a druid can.<br />
<br />
70 druid on EQ<br />
60 druid on WoW<br />
<br />
I admit I loved my EQ druid more, but WoW druids can hold their own.</div></div><hr />
