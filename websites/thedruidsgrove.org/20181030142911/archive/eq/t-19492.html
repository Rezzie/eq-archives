I thought I might find some information on the next expansion, but its not mentioned here at all.  Has the druid community moved elsewhere, or isnt there much of a community left?<br />

The info on the official website is very sketchy on what the expansion includes.</div></div><hr />

A bit of all of the above.<br />
There are not that many druids left.<br />
There is currently very little to discuss, and what little information we have been able to glean does not give much hope that the position and the problems of Druids is going to change much, if at all, with the next expansion.<br />

Welcome back<br />
 <br />
I thought I might find some information on the next expansion, but its not mentioned here at all. Has the druid community moved elsewhere, or isnt there much of a community left?<br />
With the exception of a few class boards, most EQ communities are dead.  Most posts here are in the &quot;Off Topic&quot; room.<br />
 <br />
The info on the official website is very sketchy on what the expansion includes.<br />
The information is sketchy 'cause the developers don't even know what its going to be.  The expansion wasn't even in development back in late July due to Sony pulling EQ dev team off to produce their kid friendly MMO.  So the expansion will be a rush job with hopefully some polishing going on in the following months with more content being released.  I wouldn't expect anything great from this expansion.  So far the biggest selling point is 100's of new weapons and graphics.  Well every caster can just scream &quot;WOOT!&quot; for new weapons cause we know how munch DPS we do with them.<br />

(replying in somebody's quote makes it disappear in the next quote :( )<br />
<br />
Anyway, us caster girls are still holding out some small hope for the stereotypical manga oversized mallet (and hammerspace to hide it in until needed to whack a insensitive male on the head ;) )<br />

This is the official information line on the expansion I've been able to find.<br />
<br />
Underfoot -  Coming December 15th 2009<br />
<br />
12 New zones throughout the realm of Brell Serilis<br />
New AA's<br />
New weapons and armor<br />
New tradeskill recipies<br />
Extended target window - track your friends and foes with greater accuracy<br />
Achievement System (/shudder wow)<br />
Mark of Brell item - teleport to underfoot (1 per account)<br />
<br />
<br />
Theres nothing there that makes me want it really, maybe they will add some new bank slots or a second charm something to make it needed...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess the better solution would be to have these boards magically quote previous quotes as well (yay quote pyramids!)<br />
<br />
But at any rate, my comment was not intended as criticism. I am sorry if it came across as such.<br />
