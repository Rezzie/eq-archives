 <br />
     Hit 35 today and was just wondering something. What lvl does an enemy have to be to see through your prowl ability? I noticed alot in the last week that people 3+ lvls above mine comming straight for me when I am prowling around, mostly alliance members. <br />
<br />
 Thanks</div></div><hr />

For each lvl higher than u, others see you sooner.<br />
The range of sight of which they can detect you is bigger.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes they don't see you on the first tick, but they do on the next.  With the one talent (forget the name) your stealth level is 3 levels higher than your current level.  There are also a few items that can raise your stealth level.  I have a pair of boots I keep in the bank that I used a bit while leveling, but haven't bothered since.<br />

Stealth Detection<br />
<br />
Opposite to stealth is stealth detection. Every player has a stealth detection skill level as well equal to 5 * their level (350 at level 70).<br />
<br />
It is possible to increase your stealth detection skill through potion or gear, the most prudent example being the Catseye Ultra Goggles which increases your stealth skill by 18 (or said in another way, if you are level 70, your stealth skill with said goggles with be level 73,6).<br />
<br />
Note that player can only detect stealth in front of them (180 degree cone), a level 1 rogue could sneak up behind a level 70 player without being spotted.<br />
<br />
So how good is stealth vs. stealth detection?<br />
2 players with equal stealth detection/skill is opposite of each other, one player in stealth. The opposite player will be able to spot that player from 5 yards away. Every time the stealthed player increases his stealth skill by +5, that ranged diminishes with 1 yard down to a minimum of 1 yard detection range and up to a maximum of 10 yards if a player increases his stealth detection.<br />
<br />
Stealth skill also increases the time it takes for the opponent to spot you, and higher stealth detection decreases that time. It is possible with equal stealth detection/stealth skill to approach and enemy from the front and still not have him discover you before it is too late. The amount of time you stay within the players detection cone matters alot, so getting the opener quick can mean you won't be spotted.<br />
