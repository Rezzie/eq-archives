<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the raid with 6 feran mothers on small platforms around the perimeter, boss on the large central platform who only goes active once all the mothers are dead.  Mothers spit out pups and lose ~5 percent health for each pup they birth down to about 20, where they have to be killed.<br />
<br />
     We have just added this to the farming cycle, to get people geared up on the rings, ears etc that drop.  First time we just walked in, killed things with basic tank agroing each mother plan and let fly...won easily enough.  After that we tried to fine tune things and beat each mother down to 2 percent each then kill all of them fast...lost twice doing this.<br />
<br />
     Question I have is:  Is there any reason to keep all/ most of the mothers up?  Or should we just kill them asap, leaving one up while any medding etc is done?<br />
<br />
<br />
     This fight seems REALLY easy but since we managed to blow it a couple times I would just like some opinions. <br />

Trying to burn all the Mothers at once will pretty much assure you of a zillion pups running around. Well thats what happened to us our first go lol!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My perfered method of the trial is have melee kill pups and casters kill mothers one at a time from 99 on down.</div></div><hr />

Half to north side with one MA, other half to south with another MA.  They take care of the pups.  With knights assigned to keep agro on mommas.  We also have a DPS crew (necros/rangers/etc) that take out the mommas one at a time.  We dont normally leave a momma up for med time, we just go straight into boss.</div></div><hr />

I think we just were treating this as a bit too easy maybe.  We have a certain segment of the raid that just will not listen until they die a few times, heh.<br />

 <br />
When I did this, the crew had knights/SKs aggroing the Momma's with Stuns/whatever Sks cast for long range aggro. Pup is CCed until MA gets to it.<br />
 <br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainne</div><div class="date">10-31-2006, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had 1 plate tank (with a healer sitting on the pedestal at a distance) at each mother to kill pups and 1 MA everyone else assisted off of. Once a mother was down to about 40%, we killed it.  With one left, we all moved to a corner except mt for named.</div></div><hr />

But we've had trouble on the Master of Hate a few times.  A few tanks seem to have the consenus that agro needs to be bounced around else the Master will increase his DPS exponentially.  My question is how do tanks initally get agro on the Master if he's not targeted until all the Feran die?  And if after wipe and retry, will the Master reset his DPS amount?  Seems our 2nd attempt in same evening resulted in quick deaths for the tanks right from the beginning.  Unless it's the healer's fault.. i duno.</div></div><hr />

Ranger becomes rampage tank. We do bounce aggro between 2 MTs so I guess the damage output increase is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">His dps does ramp up if he remains aggro'd on one person for too long.   Weaponshield or a riposite (have them use a big dmg big dly weap if they have one) will build up aggro fast b/c of the extra amount of swings it produces.   If a tank is building up aggro during that time it might not matter if he ends up taunting off of the ranger so probably better to have them save aggro tools with a timer until after ae taunting off the ranger (just be sure not to let the ranger die though or the aggro they built up goes to waste).<br />
 <br />
Other than that there are a few ways to help with building aggro better than usual.   Sk/enc aggro buffs are the usual ones, you can also try to stack on as many proc buffs as possible... panther, stormblade, sloth, skin of the repitle and that mage ds style one will all attribute aggro to the person they're procing off of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">12-21-2006, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Mellen!  All good ideas.  I'll see if I can talk with our Tank officer about them.<br />

Happy Festivus everyone!!</div></div><hr />
