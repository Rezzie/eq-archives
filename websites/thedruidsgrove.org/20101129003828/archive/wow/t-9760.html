I used to play before they started charging people for the unfinished english game while keeping the Korean version up-to-date regularly.  Lasttime I played Korean players had literally 2-3 times as many classes to advance into.  They also had much more content, many more dungeons and lots more Items.  Now this nothing against Koreans, not at all.  It's mostly that I didn't get how Gravity saw fit to stiff the english community so badly with the game when it came to the content.  And then while the Koreans had a finished product, began charging the english players for the unfinished beta product the Koreans were already done playing through.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure the english client of the game is probably up-to-date by now with what the Korean client had a few years back, but I am also willing to the the Korean client is still a good year or 2 ahead of the english client still.</div></div><hr />
