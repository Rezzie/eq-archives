I have found that PoR has allowed me to gain access to gear upgrades and new experiences that previously seemed unattainable.  It's also caused me to realise that I've been missing out on a lot of DoD content.<br />
<br />
This expansion has breathed much needed new life into Everquest for me, so it gets a 2 thumbs up!<br />

That puts PoR at the top of my &quot;Benefit Gained vs Time Spent ratio&quot; list for all expansions :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, haven't spent any time in PoR yet, though my warrior and chanter are just about 66, so I'll be taking the crew to Takish/Elddar soon to get auras and to do the PoG quest for them.  We'll see what happens after that.<br />

I noticed the opinion of porthio posted on your front page.  I think your perspective might be a little skewed with the level of difficulty on this fight.  have everyone in your guild log on at once, put on your banked time gear on and go attempt him.  you will not beat him.  he hits entirely too hard and nightshade is a major frustration.<br />
 <br />
this event took our guild (who just broke into dp) 4 tries to beat WITH legitimate strats used.  since beating him, we have wiped twice out of 5 attempts.  it may be slightly less involved than say, Vish, but this isn't a Time fight.<br />
 <br />
as for the expansion, I enjoy some zones but I have to agree with the something I read not too long ago that's it's full of already forgotten zones.  from what I've seen, most go and get their spell and progression quests done and don't come back.  they go to DoD and DoN for their grinds.  my BL loves arcstone though, fully slowable mobs, it's nice to have a new zone since PoP (PoV specifically) where a slower can solo for decent xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And still, a fight similar or less than challenging that Vishi doesn't really fit in with Demi Plane level loot. Vishimtar loot at best, but not a flippin 190 hp augment. (when dark heart of vishimtar is 175hp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">05-22-2006, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tenielle you're probably referring to my update.  These events were pathetically easy before updates.  We had a raid of 18 killing Porthio and the 3 dragons the very same night PoR was released.  Porthio used to be single pulled so that you did not have to deal with Nightshade at the same time.  The 3 relic dragons were being 1-grouped just a few days later.  Corruption of Ro was probably do-able with 4 groups etc.  Events were way out of wack to begin with because of a few yahoos that got to beta test gave devs a skewed view of difficulty (or so I was told) so that they could tear through PoR fast.  Unfortunately after they tore through the first half of progression they got power ownt by Sullon Zek because they can't hang.  And then there is Deathknell, hope you are wearing protection because your balls are about to be hurting til the next patch QQ.<br />
<br />
I agree the new Porthio is no joke.  Nightshade is a major pain, they did a good job on the revamp.  I still think the 190/165 aug is too good for the quality of event, but they introduced similar augs on other weak events throughout so whatevers.</div></div><hr />
