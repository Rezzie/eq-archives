They would be right up your alley in your musical tastes. Also, another band that just wowed me was the mid card band Unexpect. Those guys are freaking amazing! A nine string bass player and he was just like awesome, best bass player I ever seen, and considering, on my list Les Claypool is up there with Emma Anzai following behind.... Honestly, Unexpect was just wicked live...... they have the most unique sound I think I ever heard, and were just well nuts!</div></div><hr />
