A registered partnership has the same legal consequences as a marriage, with the exception of the right to have the partnership solemnized and the right to adopt children together.<br />
<br />
Yesterday we tossed it out. If you're going to fix something, don't just band-aid it - fix it properly. So with a vote of 84 to 41 parliament yesterday passed a new amended Marriage Act which also include same-sex marriages.<br />
<br />
The amended Marriage Act will:<br />
<br />
    * Allow couples of the same sex to enter into marriage. The amended act will also open the way for The Church of Norway and a registered religious community to have the right – though not the obligation – to solemnize same-sex marriages. Today The Partnership Act enables two homsexual persons of same sex  to enter into a registered partnership with one another. A registered partnership has the same legal consequences as a marriage, with the exception of the right to have the partnership solemnized and the right to adopt children together.<br />
    * Repeal The Registered Partnership Act. Registered partners should have the possibility to convert the partnership into marriage.<br />
    * Allow married couples of same sex to be evaluated as prospective adoptive parents on an equal basis with heterosexual married couples. Today a partner in a registered partnership may with the consent of the other partner adopt the latter’s child, unless the child is an adopted child whose origin is a foreign state that does not permit such adoption.<br />
    * Give lesbian spouses and cohabitants the same access to medically assisted reproduction as heterosexual couples and cohabitants<br />
    * Give children of lesbian couples conceived by medically assisted reproduction same legally protection as children born in heterosexual relationships after birth through medically assisted reproduction.<br />

In CA it looks like Gay marriage is going to be allowed this month.  Nice month for it, eh? :)  I can imagine the wedding business is going to be popping.</div></div><hr />
