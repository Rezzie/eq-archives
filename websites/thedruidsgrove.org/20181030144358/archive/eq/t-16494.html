<br />
Where were you? What were the four mobs? What had you cast up until that point? What agro reducing AAs do you have? What kind of agro did your tank have on the mobs? Etc etc...<br />

Palli <br />
Cleric<br />
Monk <br />
Wizzy<br />
Druid<br />
Cant remember last <br />

I had a developer check with server side scripting and the spell does not increase aggro upon application. You are not going to draw more aggro healing a group 30 times - so this is a non-concern.<br />
 <br />
And <br />
 <br />
Ok, just got some results back about SotF concerns.<br />
 <br />
Aggro Tests:<br />
 <br />
The spell does not generate Aggro. They used server scripting to get an exact aggro amount before and after the heal hit. The values did not change.<br />
 <br />
Range:<br />
 <br />
The spell now has 200 range<br />
 <br />
Known Bug:<br />
 <br />
The spell is not firing the correct amount of 'waves' in some cases. This is being sent back to Code to be fixed. It will be fixed before it goes Live.<br />

<br />
It seems to me that the spell does not add aggro, but does, add you to the aggro list. There is a difference. I think it puts you on the list but lets say at 0 hate. As long as there are others around you do not pull aggro. I have used it to heal a tank with multi mobs and not pulled aggro where a normal Spam heal would have, but in the case of healing a puller, as soon as they FD or die, guess what. You have aggro. <br />
<br />
The question is, is this the way it is supposed to be?  <br />
<br />
To be compared to DARB it should not put you on list at all so you can save a puller if they are in the 200 range FD or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lowerth</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Non agro spells do not matter at all.<br />
Casting a buff such as skin or regen on a puller will transfer all mob agro to the caster as soon as the puller fades or FD.<br />
It is not an issue with the spell but with the user.<br />
Never ever ever cast any spell on a puller without making sure that he/she is clear from agro.<br />
To make an example:<br />
Group. Bard, cleric, monk, pally, mage, druid<br />
Monk is pulling Bard is cc and slower<br />
Bard is playing mana song, Monk pulls and enters song range then FD's all mobs the monk was agro on are now agro on the Bard and because of the shared nature of the mana song the entire party (iirc)<br />
 <br />
Once again if you cast any beneficial spell on a person you become part of the agro list for all mobs that were agro on the same person.  I am unsure if aura does this also but the range on aura is very small.<br />
 <br />
I'll say it again Never cast on a puller without making sure that they are clear of agro!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annabella</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://files.operationgamma.com/sotf2aggro.zip (10mb / divx encoded avi)<br />
 <br />
It's not hard to reproduce this, so micro details shouldn't be necessary (especially if you have the advantage of resetting the casting redelays to more quickly go through different scenarios/setups).<br />
 <br />
I cast the thing about 6 times, twice I let Tuning go down to low-20's health and casting SotF at that time put me on the hate list.<br />
 <br />
The other 4 times I cast when Tuning was around 55-70% of health, and none of those times did I get put on the hate list (though only the time @ 63% health and somewhere between 55-60% health did he get healed, at higher amounts he did not).<br />
 <br />
So the health of the person you heal (or how many &quot;waves&quot; - horrible term imo - of SotF you trigger through) may influence whether you got put on hate list or not.  Although it's only a small sample of data, it's a notable observation.<br />
 <br />
Make no mistake though, anyone who is currently using this spell (misinformed dev infoz or not) and believing you won't end up on aggro is in for a rude awakening.  Whether this is by design or not doesn't matter to me, I actually assume(d) we were not going to be given an aggro-free spell like Divine Arb, but more of a cleric epic shield click (which does generate aggro like any group heal).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeia</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This seems to be the same as with other healing spells. If you heal someone, the monster may or may not put you on their hate list, depending on the monster's intelligence and your luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annabella</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think it's the reverse in a sense (you can have it so that you rarely get on aggro, as opposed to rarely avoid getting on aggro), but maybe influenced by the same fault in the code.<br />
 <br />
With a &quot;normal&quot; heal I would NEVER be able to reproduce the kind of results frequency I get with sotf, but there are times that with a normal heal (or buff, or any other aggro-inheriting action,) sometimes forget to apply to you.<br />
 <br />
With SoTF I didn't get on aggro more times than I did; but I wouldn't make presumptions about the design (and stepping through the script in a server-side test isn't empirical either, it's just a single scenario that won't take into account the factors of others).</div></div><hr />
