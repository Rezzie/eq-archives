I just got a Korlach Signet Collar (205hp / 215mana / 25svC&amp;M / 20svF / +3 regen / Focus: Gelidran Anger).  I like the resists, however I also like the stun resist on my old neck.  Also: Tacticians Shield vs Barrier of Freezing Winds?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Opinions?<br />
<br />
Also,  I am in a small guild that doesn't really raid unless guests of local uber guilds.<br />
<br />
I've got an 11k hp / 2300ac warrior &amp; 8.5k hp / 9k mana shaman.<br />
<br />
I'm decent at 3 boxing all of them.  Best I can do is drop stuff that quads 2k, partially slowable with 100k hp.  Or for sustained unslowable fights, I can do AoW and thats about my limit.<br />
<br />
I have all my spells except ancients and reptile skin(f 68.3).  What can I do to get upgrades?  <br />
<br />
Suggestions etc?</div></div><hr />

70.5 hard has two chest rewards that would be upgrades, ring + boots.<br />
&quot;Sabotage!&quot; has leggings and charm upgrade.<br />
Speaking of charm, can also do slipgears gem quest (not sure if it's an upgrade though, charm + charm augs aren't always accurate on magelo).<br />
Completing the 5 dodh mission arcs (69,70,Bellfast, Dustspirit,Widdlethorp) will yield an evolving mask (with 50 to all saves clicky) that's an upgrade.<br />
If you don't know already, look here: http://samanna.net/gen.info/prog.dod.shtml for a nice break-down of all the dodh quests and rewards.<br />
Also, http://samanna.net/gen.info/focus_70check.shtml lists focus (foci?) available, each focus name link takes you lucy, which lists what items have the focus.<br />
More important than 50-100hp/mana upgrade in a slot are focus upgrades. My philosophy is: Focus &gt; all, when considering upgrade options.<br />
 <br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />
