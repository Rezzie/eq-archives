<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-10-2005, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a) Does your attack skill from your currently wielded weapon affect your to hit rate, or does cat form come with a built in attack skill?  I notice while in cat form my skill stays the same as out of it, but when I put away my weapon lowering my skill to 5 (unarmed) I didn't notice any extra misses.   Same question with attack power.  I had been not bothering to keep up my staff skill since i never use it, but I'm wondering if this is hurting my DPS in cat form and I guess bear form.<br />
<br />
b) I recently put a point in that talent that raises your attack power in cat form by 4% per rank.  The 4% bonus seems to only affect my base cat bonus and not my agility which seems like it would scale poorly(I gained a whole 2 ATK Power from it, yehah).  Has anyone ever asked a dev if thats by design?  Seems like the more mudflation drives up our gear the less useful this talent will be since its a flat add.  It also seems like its not a very good talent unless i'm missing something. (if cat form adds 120 atk power at lvl 60 and this talent gives 20% thats only a 24 atk power gain for 5 points, seems weak).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for part B, I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-10-2005, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, I somehow missed that when reading the FAQ.  I guess weapon skill must not matter as much as I thought it did because I had no problems hitting with a 5 skill at level 28 against lvl 26 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on who you talk to, and which guides you read you will get a different answer on weapon skill. Some say it uses your weapon skill the same way you would in caster, but you cannot gain skill points so it is better off using the weapon you have the highest skill in. Others say that in forms you are considered at max weapon skill for your level and will always act accordingly so you should use the best weapon you have even if you haven't trained up your skill yet. Its your choice which to believe. Personally I follow the latter school of thinking, as I've noticed the same thing you have. That super cool 2hander I just got, but have only 5 skill in misses constantly, but when I change forms there are no problems hitting unarmed.<br />
<br />
On a side note, it would take care of this discussion completely if we just had our own weapon type while in forms, claws or something that skilled up only while in weapon form. You would then know exactly what the skill is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-12-2005, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I tested this for myself today and well the FAQ is wrong.  I had a 2.5% miss rate using my 135 skill staff in cat form.  I also had a 2.5% miss rate using my 1 skill mace in cat form.(both tests done for 30 minutes)  My DPS stayed steady in the 45 DPS range for both tests.  I then tried just wielding the 1 skill mace in druid form and I missed well over half the time for the first 50 skill gains.  I tested cat form again with skill 50 and again the DPS and hit rate did not miss.<br />
<br />
The only conclusion I can draw is that cat form treats you as having max skill when attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">10-12-2005, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I'll make a note to update the FAQ with this.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EzyB</div><div class="date">10-12-2005, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to number 1) No.. your weapon skill does not count in your forms.  At level 20 I had a staff maxed, and my cat form hit fine.  Then I trained 2H mace and equiped one, and no change in my cat form attack.  Caster form I can't hit worth crap and my damage stinks, but in Cat and bear form it uses the max &quot;skill&quot; for your level.<br />
<br />
2) Im not sure about this as Im not high enough level to test out the numbers.<br />
<br />
P.S. Str is your friend for feral druids dispite the cat being &quot;rougue-like&quot; Str will benifit you more than agility will any day.</div></div><hr />

That said your wrong about weapons having any bearing on your hit/miss in feral (unless ofcourse it has +hit % as a stat).  Just recently I've been raising my unarmed skill in-between rounds of AB, and a couple of times I've gone into battle with no weapon equiped... didn't notice any problems landing hits in feral.</div></div><hr />

Actually I was saying that they have no bearing on it, the FAQ said to hit rates were based on weapon skill, thought I'd test it since it didn't seem right.<br />
<br />
As for my second question, they seem to have changed the talent in 1.8 and it seems more useful now.  Before I gained 2 AP for my point in it, with the new talent its 50% of my level which would have been 14 AP.  It still isn't going to scale very well, but I can live with that as long as the bonus is pretty big (90 AP at lvl 60 for 3 points seems reasonable).</div></div><hr />
