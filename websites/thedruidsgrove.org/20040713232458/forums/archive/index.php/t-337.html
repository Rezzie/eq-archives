Please..&lt;/span&gt;<br />
<br />
However im curious. How many high end guilds atm are suffering with people having &quot;Burn Out&quot; and not having enough of the &quot;required&quot; classess for example, Wariors, Clerics, Enchanters to be able to raid what they normally do?<br />
<br />
Now on my server im sure its less of a problem mainly because you can transfer to it with all equipment. However it is still there.<br />
<br />
But im curious how guilds which dont have that ability are coping?<br />
<br />
I also dont think its just the summer which is causing it. Time wasnt quite what people expected doing trails over and over and over again... I know when we got to time we had people leave because of the deadend of the high end.<br />
<br />
Again please keep the druids should get this bah bah talk to another thread its not about that.<br />

It is a fairly level spread though so not causing problems in raids.<br />
<br />
Strangely, to me anyway, we fielded 13 clerics the other night which was a record and if I was to pick one class that might suffer burnout it would be clerics due to them being a bit of a one trick pony and not really in the thick of the action.<br />
<br />
PS. Could you tell I didnt wan't to use the word boring? :P</div></div><hr />

But in any case, yes a lot of people are getting worn out, so we have to keep recruiting all the time, which of course means backflagging etc. I think that the game is designed that way just so people have to waste tons of time not to get to the end too fast...<br />
<br />
The only solution is active recruitment, and I'm afraid that lots of guild just never really make it up when most clerics quit (let's face it, the main problem is clerics). And with new games being out I can only see it getting worse :(</div></div><hr />

The last major recruitment/reflagging drive, we picked up 4 druids (including me) before then we were short but now we are doing good on them.<br />
<br />
Several people have second characters-- many of which are level 65.  They smooth out the shortages most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArienneDileas</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has about 170 members (some are alts) and about 80 relatively active players and there are many times we log in to find we don't have enough clerics to raid.  It's interesting because of all the classes in EQ, we have more clerics tagged (26) than any other class, yet when we all log in, we may have three clerics playing on a given night.  We do have times with more, to be sure, but 3-4 is not UNtypical.  It's VERY tough to find active players who play the cleric class these days, and despite what people seem to think about the &quot;new and improved&quot; druid healing, we are now and always will be, healing patchers with very slow casting heals. <br />
<br />
We have had times, too, when we don't raid for lack of enchanters and shamen, but the real raidstopper is the cleric class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilleyEskimo</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">High end guilds are definately actively recruiting on Veeshan.  My mid-low end, causal guild is losing record amounts of long time members to the larger, high end guilds.<br />
<br />
While on one hand it is good to see others move on into the end game, it is rather dissappointing to be left behind by so many people that I've raided with for years :(   Then, you're left recruiting younger/newer players that need to be taught the basics from the ground up.  I've even found myself off doing epic hunts again, which is a phase I'd hoped was well behind us.<br />
<br />
At least the players that we've passed on to higher guilds are high quality (for the most part).  Hopefully that will open doors for others that eventually wish to move up to the end game.</div></div><hr />

PoP just wore all the players out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormfront</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me and Sanre are in the same guild.  The truth is, two of the top guilds on our server have actively tried to recruit me via tells.  It appears the druid scare that was not too long ago which made it next to impossible for a druid to join a raiding guild ended up with short numbers for some.  Now that we have the healing power that we have been given, guilds are realizing that we can easily fill in for a low night of clerics, and are damn useful for MGB Wood and spot heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild, while definitely not in the uber category, has always been short on druids.  I've even dusted off my druid a few times to get some druid buffs on the raid.   <br />
<br />
And this summer there appears to be a lot of people laying off EQ, myself included.  I think PoP was just too fatiguing with all the flagging requirements (and endless backflagging), the difficulty in getting spells the way that some of the encounters don't work very well (RZ fer instance, the Hedge, though that's rumoured to be fixed). <br />
<br />
But I think maybe the worst thing in PoP to cause burn-out was how it forced guilds to get even larger.  This is my observation of things on my server:  So there's a lot of recruitment and more back-flagging and more people just using guilds in order to get flagged, then they jump ship to a more uber guild after they get flagged.  That's really rough on guild morale.  It was like that whole Epic nonsense.<br />
<br />
And then again, it seemed like large guilds pushed themselves extremely hard in PoP.  Whatever it is that motivates guilds to push hard it seemed to be in over-drive after PoP came out.   Just my observation as an outsider with friends on the inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BEKKEN1</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the top guild (Time enabled - Saryn and TT dead, working on the Zeks :)  ) for our server and we basically never stop recruiting but it's very selective.  We can usually managed to hit the 72 cap on time raids (with a number of bots)<br />
<br />
Overall clerics can be a challenge but not necessarily always.  we've had days with many clerics on and no warriors or monks so it can vary.<br />
<br />
some of it is the summer slump that has happen every year, some the grind thats needed to conquer time every night. <br />
<br />
You have to figure 2 hours to mobilize and clear Phase 1 every night - (course the flip side is bots are now starting to be equipped with phase 1 loot) just to pick up where you last left off.  Then every 3 days or so reclear Phase 2 and 3<br />
<br />
For example the other night we wanted to hit Coirnav for some backflagging and gank a few other named in Water while there.  got home at 730pm and we in Water clearing to coir - by 10pm waters cleared and off to Time, by 1130 phase 1 cleared and we are at Zeks (Saryn and TT dead the preious day).  At this point east coasters are getting tired and start logging.  we get a few runs in on the Zeks, get smacked around a bit then need to log since its getting late.  Next day phase 2 and 3 are up so we would have to reclear all over <br />
<br />
Dont know what the answer for Time is, certainly it's going to get more complicated as the 2nd and 3rd guilds on server get Time enabled.  You'll have a guild clear the first phase just to have others take advantage, race, cblock, etc.  Unless they master instancing for Time this is going to be a BIG problem 3-6 months out</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our guild has 92 unique accounts, over 200 members counting the huge number of alts.<br />
<br />
We turn out about 5 complete groups to any given event.  Lately, I've noted the number of clerics to be down sharply.  Clerics is one of the highest number of members we have, but even when we have events, you might see one to three on.<br />
<br />
A large number are gone for vacations, family reunions and whatever else.  The usual excuses vary depending on the time of year.  New Year hastle, spring cleaning/break, summer vacations, school starting, thanksgiving/christmas holiday - repeat for next year.  However, I think this time its just a low streak in our clerics logging on.  They otherwise seem generally happy.</div></div><hr />

I got all the major and semi-major AA(although I still want a couple more, like ND3 for example). I switched to getting my baking to 250(now at 240) and earning money for a drogmor. I've since bought the drogmor and I'm burned out on farming now too. Right now I find most of my enjoyment through raids and progressing through the tiers. It's going to happen because people will eventually get tired of the game and move on, that's only natural.</div></div><hr />

One guild in Time, and three others in planes, with two others that won't move up because...well, who knows.  We might be the largest non-manditory raiding guild on the server ---  well over 100 active members.  We are always short on Beast Lords, Rogues, Wizards and Mages.  We have some of each but never as many as we'd like.  <br />
<br />
We have Druids.  OMG, do we have Druids!  It's so bad that you have to be L65, have 100+ AA's, epic and MGB just to get a serious look.<br />

<br />
Extra mana regen...stackable...<br />
<br />
Nice melee atk buff too...<br />
<br />
And Paragon, potentially and MGB'd one at a key point in a fight.<br />
<br />
BL's are mighty scarce.<br />
<br />
To Tils original question, I would say yes there is definitely some burn out in longer term players, but thus far we have been able to recruit people pretty ably.  We have had relatively few actual retirements...more common to see extended leaves taht become permanent.  I think other guilds on our server have seen it a bit more than we have.<br />
<br />
The faces have changed a bit in the just over two years I have been in my guild but so far I am not seeing any net loss.<br />
<br />
I do worry about how much interest I am seeing in people talking about new games on the horizon.  We had some try DAOC of course when it was new, and AO, etc.  But more have tried SWG...and so very, very many are talking about WOW.<br />
<br />
Almost no one talks about EQ2 with any interest, though.  Kind of interesting that.  Makes you wonder if it is a leading indicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlords broken?<br />
<br />
Maybe they were when they were first introduced, but the beastlords I know are very happy with their class.<br />
<br />
My guild (which wouldn't be considered high end) has gone through phases as far as missing classes, but we've been consistently short on bards.  Our guildleader was a 61 ranger; he ended up rerolling as a bard partly because of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stripe bl</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope EQ2 is not so large scale raid focused.  They really need to scale back what people need to have to be able to play the game.<br />
<br />
Reading this thread makes it obvious that this can't be the right way to have pushed the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would love to see large raids require 18 people, not 80 people.<br />
<br />
But maybe all that does is push the problem down as all guilds downsize and still have the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevle</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xegony, we lost about 60 people in the 2 month period surrounding Shadowsbane... so yeah! Amazing we survived. Back up near where we were before, still a bit short and farming/reflagging constantly in middle PoP instead of Elemental, mostly missing in the enchanter bard cleric wizard ranger catagories. Enchanters most needed. Most of our apps have come from other guilds disbanding or large numbers leaving, and applying all at once. Two guilds lost large and one disband, for our apps, plus the few random apps we always got. (They went bust *then* apped to us btw... /duck) 15 clerics on roster, 3 wizards, and 1 enchanter main, to give an idea....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KnightWard</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mmm..<br />
<br />
Personally, my guild is suffering minor issues with its Cleric line, mostly due to things like Summer Vaction.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we've lost a few monks and are kinda short on Wizards, but in my opinion fairly set with everything else.<br />
<br />
Our Shadow Knights are enjoying more pull time and they are working very well with our remainng monks to make excellant pulls possiable.<br />
<br />
The Guild is fast realizing the 6 Active Druids we have on nightly, as we can fill in for Cleric or Wizard roles as the situation demands, and has - in my view, enabled us to get better gear then what would nomrally be excepted by the general Druid population in a non DKP guild.<br />
<br />
Our 6 Druids are half Evoc speced, and Half Alternation.  We all have the standard Druid AAs of SCM 3, Sotw, MGB, and Radiant Cure.  We average around 4200 Mana and ft 7.<br />
<br />
The Guild itself is in the Upper Luclin (Emp/VT) Area and Middle of PoP (Tier 2/3 Bosses) and is not afraid to add druids to the CH rotations, have us Kite adds, and Burn mobs as the situation demands.<br />
<br />
The over all view of the Druids in my guild is infact, rather high.  The class flexability has certainly enabled us to do many encounters that we would have missed out on otherwise having been forced to wait on Clerics to log in.<br />

<br />
Of course it is.  Players eat up content like Trolls eat Gnomes :)<br />
<br />
One of SOE's main goals is to keep the players busy.  Creating content is expensive and requires work.  Not only to create it, test it, balance it but also to fix all the bugs you create when you implement it.<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Beastlords broken?  Maybe they were when they were first introduced, but the beastlords I know are very happy with their class.[/quote]<br />
<br />
The problem with Beastlords is the same as the one facing all pet classes.  I was amazed when they introduced Beastlords.  Of all the new classes they could have added, they added one that makes things worse.  Pets have always been a problem.  If you raid, you know that on many raids, pets are just not allowed.  They cause too much trouble, and this is after many &quot;fixes&quot; to them.<br />
<br />
In addition, pets add lag.  I was totally stunned when they added Beastlords, familiars, AA multi pets and other stuff to cause more lag for everyone.  I get to thinking the way I do about Microsoft's bloated code, that they have a secret deal with hardware manufacturers to force people to upgrade their computers to run stuff. :)<br />
<br />
P.S.  Just remembered, horses and drogmors = even more lag.</div></div><hr />

Our two Elemental+ guilds just did a mass recruitment, because of burn out. They took a number of people in my guild and others at a similar level. (Currently my guild is in Sol Ro and about to drop RZtW.) They were recruiting all classes though... since people seem to be quitting across the board.<br />
<br />
All the post VT guilds are definately short on enchanters and bards. We're down to, on average, 3 enchanters and 1 bard with 60 people on. We're to the point where people are dual boxing alts and PL'ing twinks. But hey, whatever works. I'm still enjoying playing my druid.<br />
