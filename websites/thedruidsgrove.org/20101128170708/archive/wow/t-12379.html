So, +10 MP5, means the item will cause 10 mana per 5 seconds to be regenerated during combat (aka within the 5SR [5 second rule]).<br />

Here's the geeky complete answer. (http://www.wowwiki.com/MP5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that information. I've gotten some gear with that on it. I'm not sure how much it would benefit me because I'm a resto druid and usually focus on getting +heal and int stuff. Guess I'll search through the older threads here and see how this ranks up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a resto Druid MP5 is one of your primary stats (in no particular order, +int, +spr, +heal, +mp5).  The more you have the longer you can last during boss fights without having to use innervate and/or mana pots.<br />
<br />
In short +1 int &lt; 1MP5 and +1 heal &lt;&lt;&lt; 1MP5 and +1 spr &lt;&lt; 1MP5.  So an item with +10 int vs one with +10 MP5, I'd take the +10 MP5.  Of course this depends on your talent spec, what you are doing (raid v 5-man v PvP) and the relationship between the stats. Ex.  +1000 healing does you no good if you only have 3 int. ;D<br />
<br />
For the exact ratios, read http://www.resto4life.com/  Great blog.   In particular read the &quot;VS Series&quot; entries in this post (about half-way down), http://www.resto4life.com/2008/01/03/resto4life-or-at-least-2007/.  Don't get hung-up with the math and/or charts (unless you want to).  Read the supporting text and follow-up comments.</div></div><hr />
