 <br />
i still not seeing why someny druids want it gone i find it to be a very usefull and handy aa ya and the ds comes in very use full in a lot of places.<br />
 <br />
and as for raids i use it all the time thers only 1 fight in solt's i have not used it on and thats the glome that splits.<br />
 <br />
other then that if ya time the use of it you can use it on allmost any fight.<br />
for the 4-8 raids out ther thats peopel say not to use it on does that give reasion enuff to kill the Ds part of it for the 100 other raids it can be used on. <br />
i solo i raid and i group and like i say i find it a very hndy and usefull aa yet. may be it would be better to add a optiction to a druid class to disable the ds part at will rather then do away with it asa hole</div></div><hr />

Make the HoT/AC part 1 buff(goes in short duration buff so wouldnt be a problem with full buff slots) and 1 part DS(same deal). And tell everyone to block the DS part.  And I do understand some people will say that it is too difficult to make sure that everyone blocks it and removes it etc. If they can't do that then they probably shouldn't be raiding these raids then.  If they can't do that I'd like to see something like a direct heal right after it ends in place of the DS that would be nice!<br />
Just my thoughts on the matter, I'm curious what others think, because he does bring up a valid point it is only a handful of raids that it isn't used on.  Off the top of my head:<br />
Vish<br />
Tacvi Snake<br />
Solteris 3(I believe haven't been)<br />
... thats all I can think of if there are any more add em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is simple:<br />
<br />
Druids should be given two new AAs which are Spirit of Wood and Convergence of Spirits only without the Damage Shield component. The AAs would be no cost and would be at the exact same level that your current Spirit of Wood and Convergence of Spirits are. This would allow druids to choose whether or not to have a Damage Shield with the AA.  They would be on the same timer.<br />
<br />
Personally, I just don't use these AAs very often and don't care much.  But a number of people have mentioned this and this is the simple answer.  Every other class with a similar AA can use MGB to help out the whole raid without having to worry that they will screw up the raid.  There is no reason not to allow druids to do so as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then a person has to have an existing DS allready in order for the +DS to do anything.<br />

credit for this idea is mahz i believe over on the soe forums.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Moding to a +DS would be great situationaly, but I've always been a fan of using it in groups...and although the DS on either of these is never a lifesaver or a mad DPS burst, it's always nice.<br />

<br />
The damage shield makes the aa 100% situational. Timing it is a cop out, we should be able to use it whenever, where ever, like the cleric, shaman, and beastlord equivilents. Remove the damage shield, and replace it with either +DS or a 5% mitigation buff, and the aa becomes usable in any and all situations.</div></div><hr />

I'd be all for dropping the DS and putting a mitigation bonus on it, I'd actually champion that over a +DS. Great idea.</div></div><hr />

Laziness? Hardly. The primary reason I want to see the DS removed it to increase the functionality of the aa's.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully removing the DS from future AA's isn't off the table.  There are so many raid encounters where any type of DS will cause adds to summon and wipe the raid.<br />
<br />
Mahzz's idea that Aelfin mentioned sounds like the best solution.<br />
<br />
If someone has a DS on, then they want a DS applied anyway and sotw/cos would apply a DS<br />
<br />
If someone doesn't have a DS, then it would assume that that person didn't want one and not apply it.<br />
<br />
I like this more than any other solution suggested.</div></div><hr />

It's not laziness; I'd actually get more use out of them if I didn't have to worry that I'd be inducing a wipe by pressing a button.</div></div><hr />
