The grind  from 4 to 8 is difficult.  You basically need to be PvPing as much as you can to get as much honor as you can.... and you're on a deadline.  If you miss rank 8 before the next patch, you're screwed.  All ranks go away and you're back at ground zero.<br />
<br />
If you think you can make rank 8 in the next 4-6 weeks, go for it... if not, wait for the patch and grind honor points from there.<br />
<br />
Now with all that said, I _LOVE_ my PvP gear... especally the 4 piece bonus: 15% speed increase in form is bloody amazing.  With FS you now stealth faster than people walk.<br />
<br />
I definitely suggest you should go for it... just decide on which side of the patch you'll try for it.</div></div><hr />

Every server is different, and your progession is solely on your standing for that week. For maximum progression, try getting in the top 10 standing every week. I was able to 1 shot ever rank up til Rank 11 with top 10 standing.</div></div><hr />

Translation:<br />
If you become one of the ten biggest PvPers on your server - 8 weeks (assumes you haven't started yet).<br />
<br />
Note: when the pre-expansion patch hits the entire honor system is going to be erased and replaced with a new point system, you will get no credit for honor you grind before the change.  The exact date of the patch is unknown, but it has been suggested as early as the original scheduled expansion release (later this month), but it will certainly be before the expansion itself in January.  Therefore you have 2-6 weeeks to try and make it.</div></div><hr />

I'm kinda stuck at 6 atm, but I could get to 7 if I pvped a couple hours a day (haven't much lately, I get burnt out pretty fast :()  Not sure how it is after rank 7.  <br />
<br />
Silithud chestguard is so lovely @_@  I was lucky enough to get it our first time downing moam, I was amazed, I'm never lucky like that &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got to rank 7 and 80% after grinding my brains out in PvP..then I didnt do PvP for one week and now im at rank 6 20%...freaking insane it decays so fast!!!?!?!!? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, with the patch coming pretty soon (anywhere from a week to a month, we can't be sure atm), ranking is pretty risky now.  I think we're all hoping blizz gives us some kinda warning so we know what to do pvp-wise, but I'm not sure they will.  :/  So it's a risk, if you are trying to rank right now.  <br />
<br />
I was hoping to get to rank 8 before the patch, but I'm stuck at 7 now, and out of town, haven't gotten any honor this week, so I might even slip down to 6 again.  So uh, I'll probably just give up on trying to get to 8 before the patch I think :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that PvP armor looks pretty good. I calculated the stats in comparison to my current, and I'd only lose 10 intellect for a LOT of bonuses. Woo, I want it.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the patch is coming soon, so we're all wondering if we're going to make that cut-off. Hehe. Personally, I'm going PvP crazy. Why? I'm not sure, as my searches haven't found me much of anything (could be looking in the wrong place), but I've heard that in the next patch there will be no more ranks--you can only display the highest you earned. I hate the idea of losing ranks, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stay with Sergeant Major. Gr. I'm aiming to make it to Lt. Commander for the PvP set and rank name. Stretch, but I want it. 100k honor so far this week, lets see how much more I can get and how far that puts me rank wise (I'm 88% complete with rank 5, woo). o.O</div></div><hr />
