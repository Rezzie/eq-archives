<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Philio</div><div class="date">01-20-2006, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello folks,<br />
<br />
I have upgraded my gear alot during the past year but have slowed down during the last month or so.<br />
<br />
I was hoping someone might have some suggestions for upgrades.  My magelo is in my signature.<br />
<br />
For context, I am in a guild alliance that is doing IKKY now (should beat IKKY4 this week), though we have not raided Time yet (hope to start doing so in the coming weeks).  I can make money easily for any buyable items that may be out there and I believe I have taken everything I can out of the DON merchant with RCs.  I was fortunate to stumble upon a great deal for Qvic loot rights and managed to get the Gaellin's sleeves and booties from there.<br />
<br />
Some things I am already working on:<br />
RSS - Charm, +70 mana augs (but bad luck getting loots/winning rolls)<br />
DOD - I take any offers I get for Hard missions and have already upgraded a slot or 2 with DOD mission loot<br />
MPG Trials - I have received only one invite here (we won the Body trial with me as main healer - woot) but always have it in my LFG message<br />
<br />
I am happy with my fire/healing foci but need work in most other places.  FT is maxed but resists can use some help.  HP/mana is not bad but I can always use more.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />
<br />
