I was so excited its crazy.  Been going for that staff for like 6 months.<br />
<br />
Now to figure out what to enchant it with.  I have an Aurastone Hammer that I have a +55heal encant on (so +80heal total on that) with the Lei of the Lifegiver from AV.  So thats like +130 heal and 9mp5 on the combo.<br />
<br />
Im gonna enchant Arlokk with something... thinking +20spi for an extra 55spirit for regen'ing / innervating.  Or maybe 22int.  Anyone have any recommendations?</div></div><hr />

Go w/ the 20 spirit and use it for regen (if you do healer rotations).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently got my Mace of Unending life and put 22 int on that coupled with my lei of the lifegiver that's my new healing set, so I may replace the +55 heal on my WoA with +spirit.</div></div><hr />
