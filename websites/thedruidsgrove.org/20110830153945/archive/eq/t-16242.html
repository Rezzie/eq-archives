<br />
He also also requested that if you are basing the idea around something in game, that you provide that information.<br />
<br />
I plan to let this thread run for the next few days and submit a summary. SoF is still a few months off, so if people don't get their ideas in before the summary, I will forward them to Merloc anyway, just trying to make things easier on him.<br />

For the click, not too picky on that.  I did like the spell haste clicky that we got on the Anguish BP</div></div><hr />

Clicky spell haste with decay would be fantastic, though.</div></div><hr />

Utility possibilities:  Clicky atk debuff (faster cast/combined debuff!)<br />

Or clicky nuke, though I'd like that the least...reuse timer will be too great to be useful imo.</div></div><hr />

This means that it will be somewhat pointless to have a debuff on it as the recast timer will mean you still need to have the spell memmed.  Unless, the debuff stacks with current/planned debuff spells, then it might be something I would like to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After doing polling both on EQlive and The Druid's Grove feedback seems fairly inline with what I expected.<br />
<br />
Worn Focus:<br />
<br />
One interesting suggestion was to have the worn focus be a 25% mana pres on our 3.75 second cast time heal spells.  Failing this, the most common request was to have the Tunic have 25% mana pres to our SoF 3.75 Heal spell.<br />
<br />
It should also be noted that we would like the TBS Tunic to be retro-fitted with a 25% mana pres focus for Pure Life Rank III.<br />
<br />
Click Effect:<br />
<br />
Due to the two sided nature of the class, The click either needs to help both styles of Druid, or be more offensive based in nature.  The two most popular requests I saw were:<br />
<br />
1:  Clicky spell haste as per the Tunic of Everliving Brambles - this would allow for both Healing and DPS druids to gain from the Click.<br />
<br />
2:  A combined attack debuff effect.<br />
<br />
It is important to note we do 'not' want another Damage Shield Click, nor do we want tunics with 15 minute recycle timers.  The recast timer - if it has one, should be between 3 and 5 minutes.<br />
<br />

A self spell haste like others have mentioned would be nice. I'd also like to say that it needs to have a short cast time and not 13+ mins refresh(/rude TBS)<br />
 <br />
A mana pres to the main spam heal of the expansion I think is the obvious choice for a focus and one that would have the greatest impact.</div></div><hr />

For worn focus I'd love to see a Reptile Skin focus like one in Demiplane I hear we're getting it upgraded and that'd be ideal.</div></div><hr />

We really need to start pushing for hate reduction, if we're to ever see these effects on any future items.</div></div><hr />

For the last few expansions we have not had that, the tss tunic is nice and all but I could really care less of haveing a healing mod to our fast heal.<br />
<br />
I would definately like to see a bene MP on the SoF tunic's and as for the clicky perhaps a heal spell/hate decreaser line would be nice also and or debuff clickie.  But i don't want another click DS for its pointless with a long recast timer.</div></div><hr />
