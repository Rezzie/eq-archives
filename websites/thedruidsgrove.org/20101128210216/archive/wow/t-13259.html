<br />
Last night I was running 25 man Naxx with a friend's guild and we downed Grobbulus. Their policy is once you get an upgrade you have to pass until everyone gets something. I won the Tunic of Indulgence (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40277) because everyone else had gotten gear.<br />
<br />
With the new tunic I lose my T7 set bonus. As a feral kitty this is a big deal. However, I could then swap out hit gear: Gored Hide Leggings (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37644) for Leggings of Discord (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39224) or Boots of the Neverending Path (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44297) for Boots of the Worshipper (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39196).<br />
<br />
The T7 set bonus makes it so much easier to manage a rotation. I may be better to wait til patch 3.1 and get the Glyph of Shred.<br />
<br />
Thoughts? Any idea what gems to socket? I'm tempted to skip the socket bonus and just stack agility (in preparation for 3.1).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think, unless you are hit capped, the Tunic of Indulgence is a huge upgrade to the Heroes chest.  42 hit + the obvious 16 hit socket = 58 hit!!!  That makes a huge difference on the flexibility of your other gear/gems/enchants.  <br />
<br />
I would Gem it with +16 Hit (Rigid), and Shifting or Sovereign Twilight Opal (depending on your crit).  One is Agi/Stam the other is Str/Stam.</div></div><hr />

If I switch tunics it would be better to drop hit gear and try to maximize dps. I crunched some numbers and ended up with:<br />
<br />
+85 crit<br />
+18 exp<br />
-16 attack power<br />
-10 hit rating<br />
<br />
The crit boost is a full percentage point. With the upcoming dot crits, crit rating is even more important.<br />
<br />
I'm going to give it a try and see how frustrated I get with managing a rotation. Losing 4 seconds off rip means I won't be able to use Ferocious Bite at all.</div></div><hr />

Check out Tossk's Calculator for more details.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimjonn</div><div class="date">03-03-2009, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Tossk's Calculator, for 3.1 the new tunic is rated higher than the T7 chest with a 2 piece set bonus. Prior to 3.1, it's rated lower. <br />
<br />
Regardless, I think I'm not prepared to lose the set bonus. I'll wait til I get another T7 piece and then make the switch.<br />
<br />
I would love to see all T7.0 gear be purchased by badges. Most of the T7.5 gear and all of the T8 would still only be attainable through raids. No idea what the new badge gear will be, but that's what I'd like to see.</div></div><hr />
