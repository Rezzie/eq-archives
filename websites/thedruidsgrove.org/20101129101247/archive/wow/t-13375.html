<br />
so i said i better use my new spec ! - unglyphed mind u.<br />
<br />
we went to uk heroic with 3 people we know.<br />
<br />
and it went ok - but omg was it stressful compared to dpsing let alone even tanking !<br />
<br />
but only 2 people died in the whole run.<br />
<br />
and it was the first 5 man, normal or heroic i've ever healed ! :biggrin: <br />
<br />
not sure if i am gonna want to do resto a lot though.....<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
What was the most challenging part?  Final bosses' slams?  First bosses' ice tomb?  Second bosses' random AoE (and spawned adds)?  Trash before the first boss?<br />

One day I'll give it a try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm, bosses i think the most - mainly the 2nd one with the 2 of them and the random aeo/adds.<br />
<br />
first one was ok - tank picked adds up and the dps got me out of a single tomb.<br />
<br />
last one seemed easiest boss to heal tbh ?<br />
<br />
4 trash was interesting as i dont have ANY healing addons which would have probably made it easier to check on health / choose who to heal ??<br />
<br />
need something for timers on LB ?<br />
<br />
infact :  can someone point me towards must have 5 man healing addons ?<br />
<br />
i was chuffed only 2 people died and that was because i was clicking on the tank and concentrating on him a bit too much and then had to click off the tank to heal anyone else - hence the need for addons ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing without addons is very doable, but I can't imagine doing it without mouseover macros in the default ui.<br />
<br />
for example:<br />
#showtooltip Lifebloom<br />
/cast [target=mouseover, help] Lifebloom; Lifebloom<br />
<br />
That lets you select the player to heal by merely hovering your mouse over their healthbars and hitting the appropriate key, rather than having to select them then hit the spell key.<br />
<br />
If you're a click caster(click to select toon then click onscreen button to heal), mouseover macros won't help you, but an addon like Clique or Healbot probably would.<br />
<br />
Myself, I use Grid for healing frame/info display, and mouseover macros to deliver the heals.  I have a co-worker who's rapidly becoming a resto convert (from feral) and he's found Healbot easy to set up and very helpful.<br />
<br />
Another option that I haven't investigated but have heard is good is VuhDu (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/vuhdo.aspx) (VooDoo).</div></div><hr />

At first a little confusion, but once configurated, it's pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

Try out decursive - Left click - Curses <br />
Right Click - Poisons<br />
All in neat little boxes. try it out also with healbot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to use decursive in the old days when i did raid Talon. Healbot just looks a little confusing, especially to a new healer !<br />
<br />
Not sure what I need to do with it / what i need to use as a minimum to get me started on making healing easier !</div></div><hr />

Get a compact Raid/Group-Frame Addon which shows your buffs and debuffs on players and u are good to go.<br />
U can bind all heals and despell mechanics on mouse-keys (maybe with modifiers like &quot;CTRL&quot; or &quot;ALT&quot;). <br />

While you can configure it to use mouse/key presses, I found just macroing the relevant heals to be just fine and dandy.<br />
<br />
In a 5 man run it takes up very little screen real estate but gives you a very compact HuD of what is going on in the group and what heals are currently running against each party member.<br />
<br />
My two quibbles about it that would make it perfect, though I've no idea how you'd implement it, would be some kind of proximity display so you'd know your likely recipients of Wild Growth if you cast it on player x in your group. While you can have it automatically setup your party, it doesn't order the player classes at all, I like to have the Tank(s) at the top, followed by the healers, melee then ranged DPS and manually moving things around takes a couple of minutes but its an annoyance rather than a deal breaker on both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though from what I heard first hand from a couple of healers, you can easily get by with mouseover macros and the default UI.<br />
<br />
And if you are a clicking fiend, you can do it old school and just click to target (our guild's resto does it that way, no addons) and he is awesome.  Probably has carpal tunnel syndrome, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can do, but it's a nightmare trying to keep track of what is going on. Lifebloomer is the next step up imo but I can see from the article on Grid that I've ignored it for long enough and it's time to spend a little effort getting myself sorted out with it.</div></div><hr />

  Grid is harder to setup, but worth it ecspeically(sp?) if u have memory usage problems. There are tutorials  to help you set it up just search on the wow - ui forums, ( atleast the US ones)<br />
if u go with grid +clique ( i havnt tried them yet cause i dont want to have to set them up right now, i might later) make sure u get other grid addons to go with it like Gridstatushots and sridstatuslifebloom, if u search the forums on wow ui forums then u will probly get more help on that then me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess my biggest thing about all of this is .... well  i use healbot and not sure if there is anything better. What do you guys/gals think?</div></div><hr />

The number of buttons you can bind is really the biggest advantage for Healbot vs other like mods.  Most only allow you to bind left, center &amp; right.  <br />
<br />
I use a 5-button mouse and felt gimped using grid/SmartDebuff/lifebloomer.  (very possible I just didn't know how to use them)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except you don't target anything!  This seems like a tiny difference, but makes all the difference in the world!!!<br />
<br />
You can have the boss targeted the whole time and see incoming spike damage to a tank (long cast abilities etc)<br />
<br />
Lots of time saved by just clicking a box, rather than targeting then clicking one of your 12 options from a hotbar.  (even if you only use the 3-button mouse, you can bind more spells by using click + (any button) funtions.  <br />
<br />
Tells you who has what debuff and allows you to clear it with a single button without changing targets.  (even if you aren't healing....lazy boomkins, can't even clear a curse!  :-P)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">05-22-2009, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healbot puts up little unitframes  (boxes/healthbars) for each party/raid member and pet.  At least I think I remember it doing pets...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, when  your mouse is merely over the box for player X, and you click the button that you've bound to Healing Touch, it then starts casting HT on that person, without changing your actual target.  Allowing you to monitor boss health, spell casts, etc.  Whichever button you press, selects the spell to be cast, and whatever unit your mouse pointer is over selects who it's cast upon.<br />
<br />
It's the same basic functionality as a mouseover macro, but a bit more flexible because of the multi-button support. And I find it's bars easier to watch than the defaultUI's little skimpy stripe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did not want to...but we'd been a group of 4 people waiting for the Daily Heroic to Gundrak to at least 30 mins with no healer anywhere.<br />
<br />
so in the end i agreed, or rather i was cajoled, nay bullied into putting on my resto gear.  i said ok but lets hit UK as its quick and we know it like the back of our hands.<br />
<br />
i still dont have healbot set up, it still confuses me..i've tried to set up buttons on my mouse to do nourish or regrowth or lifebloom but for some reason its only partially working...ie i got lifebloom to work on a button but could i get another button to accept nourish !<br />
<br />
NO!  i was clicking on the tank for a heal and he was getting thorns !<br />
<br />
however we blitzed UK and we had only 1 death the whole run - my DK guildie (doingdps this time not tank) managed to die on Ingvar, who was also dead as he was to slow to get away from that whirling axe ! lol.<br />
<br />
still no healers around so they cajoled me to heal again - esp as we lost a dps but a guildie mage had come online and wanted to come so no space for me as oomkin. now i've been to Gundrak about 2 times !  and the tank said h'ed not tanked it for a few months.<br />
<br />
but is was fairly streaightforward.  again we only had a few deaths and no wipes....although i managed to die a couple times...was panicing on the snake boss ?  trying to stay our of his poison thing but not let the tank die and yes i died !<br />
<br />
bosses are a bit manic/panic for me still, i find it difficult without proper working addons to easily heal more than the tank ! - the last boss one was tough as everyone seemed to be being bounced/knocked around so i was out of range a couple times.<br />
<br />
i'm sure people got a bit panicy a few times as their HP went below around 30% but i managed to click enough buttons and even used WG and a single Tranquility !<br />
<br />
One thing about Resto is i seme to hardly use any mana ! i'm at around 16k depending upon the buffs in the grp.......mage/pally obviously help and we grabbed the Zul Drak altar/statue buff.<br />
<br />
this must be why there was a pvp chat going on in /p about Trees cannot be killed in pvp !<br />
<br />
so 2 more heroics healed for a grand total of 3 !!  i'm still not a happy healer nor do i 'like' healing....but no n00b stories yet to add to Des's blog !!<br />
<br />
however i do think i will stick it out and i do now think that the badges i've been saving will be spent on resto gear not feral - i've got 158 atm !<br />
<br />
i just need to get some heal addon working well whether its healbot or clique etc....<br />
<br />
i also need to sort out glyphs as i know i dont have 3 majors yet as i was too tight to spend money if healing was not going to be my thing.<br />
<br />
and i'm still limiting myself to certain heroics....not sure i could heal nexus.....first boss flinging me in the air or the one with the stalagmites that rise from the floor would probably overtax me currently......or HoL final boss Loken.<br />
<br />
but hey ho....semi resto K is in da house !<br />
<br />
and yes that means i do need a new signature :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still playing with Grid/clique. It almost does what I want, but still not quite to the degree that I'm willing to toss lifebloomer yet.  You can configure that to let you click heal if you want (ie left click Rejuve, right click lifebloom etc) and it's a minimal amount of config to at least be able to see what heals you have running even if you don't use it to actually apply them.<br />
<br />
i still dont have healbot set up, it still confuses me..i've tried to set up buttons on my mouse to do nourish or regrowth or lifebloom but for some reason its only partially working...ie i got lifebloom to work on a button but could i get another button to accept nourish !<br />
Actually I had a similar problem on mine, it's an MS 5 button mouse but I could only get heals applied using the left and right mouse buttons, very quick switch back to use mouseover macros :)</div></div><hr />

Make sure that you are selecting in combat and adding the heal to the right box  and right radio button is selected</div></div><hr />

<br />
so they know i'm a reluctant healer.<br />
<br />
i may need to look at grid / lifebloomer.<br />
<br />
i will look more at healbot and see what i'm doing wrong for setting up some buttons.<br />
<br />
it would certainly be so much easier to be able to click on the name in the healbot grid window and have the appropriate spell happen ! it was great on the 2nd heroic to be able to apply a lifebloom with a right mouse button click.<br />
<br />
i then just entered panic mode if i need to click on a bar and then a person for other heal spells !</div></div><hr />

Grand mage telestra (or whatever) - just toss a WG when everyone's being thrown around.  It's instant, so you can cast it while flying, and if you time it when everyone's in range, it heals the entire party. If needed you could hit a rejuve/Lifebloom or two while still in the air if the WG didn't hit the whole party.<br />

Stone boss w/ floor spikes (whose name escapes me entirely). Just stand between his legs.<br />
<br />
No, really!  <br />
<br />
Honest!<br />
<br />
The spikes don't cover the area directly underneath him, and if your tank is doing some aoe threat stuff (thunderclap, consecrate, etc), he'll pull the adds off you.<br />
<br />

If you've got a good group, it's not horrendous.  But if the group is not so great...  I'd avoid it too.  Hmm. In fact, I've only done it once.  Not an easy heroic boss - among the harder ones IMO.</div></div><hr />

UK is easy. helps to know the instance so well.<br />
<br />
Gundrak i did and it was ok but it did not help that i'd only ever been to Gun twice before so i dont know it well.<br />
<br />
Not sure where i'll try next : AN or perhaps HoS ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've not used HB for ages, I'm a simple creature so putting the cursor over the character in Lifebloomer (or anywhere else, raid tabs, the party list down the right of the screen or on their toon directly) and hitting<br />
2= Rejuve<br />
3= Lifebloom<br />
4= Nourish<br />
5 = swiftmend<br />
6 = Regrowth<br />
7 = Wildgrowth<br />
8 = Healing Touch<br />
9 = 999 heal (HT + that instant cast thing I've forgotten the name of)<br />
0 = Tranquility<br />

Grid is definitely not an hour's project to get set up and running to your liking, there's the main mod, then a whole host of sub-mods that you need to display the various bits and bobs that you want/need to get it working right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i like healbot from the point of view of being able to hover over someone in the healbot window and then click a mouse button to do a heal spell - i just need to work out what i am doing wrong to set it up</div></div><hr />

I've been resto 80% of my WoW life and to this day I've only healed a handful of 5-mans.  <br />
<br />
Needless to say, my rep with certain factions need work.  But I'll take low rep over the high cost of therapy I'd surely need if I took on healing 5-man pugs.<br />

Hehe, I love to PUG into 5 man and entry level 10 mans as Resto for a good fine tuning!!!  I ended up in a Naxx10 with one other healer who was an &quot;Ok&quot; Disc priest!   It was the first time I ever got close to OOMing in a 10 man!  Good times though.  It really pushes your reflexes!   :texla: <br />
<br />
I normally run with too many good healers, where I am the sloppy 5th or 6th wheel just picking up their scraps, so its nice to be the top dog once and a while. :flipbg:</div></div><hr />
