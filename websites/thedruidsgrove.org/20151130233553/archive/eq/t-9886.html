 <br />
When I say &quot;It is worth it&quot; he tells me that he believes I am not honest enough, and refuses to hand me the book. I went back through the quest, and the only quest text that I can see that I have missed is possibly the &quot;What small fish&quot; to Blumbum in CS. <br />
 <br />
The other thing that I may have done wrong, is do steps 7 and 8 of the walkthrough prematurely, I was so excited about getting the stupid totem in EW that I went right ahead with the turn in. I now have the Runed Skull in my inventory, and need the books to continue with the quest. <br />
 <br />
I have tried with epic 1.0 equipped, with the runed skull in the bank, but for whatever reason he won't give me the books. Any ideas on what else might be causing it? I'm going to go back and do the totem in EW again to make sure I didnt miss that line of text, just wondering if anyone else had this problem and was able to fix it. <br />

That's the problem.  You need to have the mangled head container on you in order to have him trust you. <br />
<br />
It rarely is a good idea to jump ahead in quest turn ins.  Because you likely end up going back and repeating earlier steps.  Which is what you are going to have to do.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If someone else does the &quot;It is worth it&quot; line to Arelat and then hand the books to the lady on the evil side, as long as they dont do the next combine, they can come back and get naother set of books, which are tradable. I managed to find a druid who was willing to do it for me today, and have now caught right back up the epic and have moved forward again. <br />

This info was keeping me from getting the books from Arelat (he said he didn't see honesty in my eyes)<br />
 <br />
The end of Part 1 of the walkthrough says to do:<br />
Do the Misc 1 combination to get the Sealed Collection Bag (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62813).  Take this back to Niera Farbreeze (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5173) in Surefall Glade (http://eqatlas.com/easternkarana.html).  She will hand you back a Wash Cloth (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62847) (do Misc 2 combination to get Wrapped Mangled Head (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62848)).<br />
 <br />
It's missing that you need to turn Wrapped Mangled Head (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62848) back in to Niera to get Mangled Head (container) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62827). As soon as I went back and turned the wrapped head in to get the container...Arelat gave me the books.</div></div><hr />
