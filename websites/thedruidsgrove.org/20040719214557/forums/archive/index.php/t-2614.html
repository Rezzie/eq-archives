<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I've never really done any charming, in fact, other than charming snow bunnies to find Tanik for my 4th shawl, I've never done any charming.<br />
<br />
I'm now entertaining the idea of starting to learn the ropes, and to maybe start banking AAs for DC (LOL, &quot;banking&quot; in my case would be akin to putting the pennies in a jar at the end of the day, should get there in a few months if I'm lucky =)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm trying to see if I understand how the XP leeching works, it's a little confusing.  I came across a statement SoE made last year, along with a comment in a patch message in April:<br />
<br />
Last year:<br />
<br />
Situation 1 - You are soloing and you have a summoned pet or a charmed pet (not including Dire Charm)- <br />
* If you do any damage to the monster at all, you get all of the experience. <br />
* If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience. <br />
<br />
Situation 2 - You are in a group and you have a summoned pet or a charmed pet (not including Dire Charm)- <br />
* If you or your group do any damage to the monster at all, your group gets all of the experience. <br />
* If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience. <br />
<br />
Situation 3 - You are soloing and you have a Dire Charmed pet- <br />
* If you do half of the damage to the monster or more, you get all of the experience. <br />
* If you do less than half of the damage to the monster, the pet gets between 25% and 50% of the experience, depending on how much damage it did. <br />
* If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience. <br />
<br />
Situation 4 - You are in a group and you have a Dire Charmed pet- <br />
* If you or your group do half of the damage to the monster or more, your group gets all of the experience. <br />
* If you or your group do less than half of the damage to the monster, the pet gets between 25% and 50% of the experience, depending on how much damage it did. <br />
* If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
And April patch comment:<br />
<br />
Charm Changes<br />
<br />
Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for the healer. <br />
Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC killed. This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience they always have. <br />
Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, is this the latest and correct info, or am I missing other statements regarding charm XP?  And if I'm reading the two statements correctly, the DC pet takes either 75% XP (you do 0 dmg), 25-50% XP (you do 50% &gt; dmg &gt; 0%), or 0 XP (you do dmg &gt; 50%).  And charmed pets would take 75%, or 0-33%, depending on how much damage you do.<br />
<br />
And what I'm also not clear on yet, in a group, is it the group that has to do 50+% of the damage, or is the formula more complicated than that?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can offer,<br />
<br />

Yep, seems about correct in my mind. My belief is that when they mean group they are talking about is the total of all members added together.  Although I have not been in a group to actually find out.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know how that works?</div></div><hr />

We used to just use a pet until it got too low, but after the charm/exp nerf we changed our tactic a little.  You would get less exp if you did it that way, even in a group where you do damage to the mob.  What we do now is just root the mob and back off the charmed pet when they're both low.  We don't bother to slow either one of them so they end up low at the same time.  If you get good enough at it, one round of DoTs will finish off both the ex-pet and the other mob so you get full exp.</div></div><hr />
