The thinking is that Balance are just too squishy untill you get the moonkin. The resto's will tell you that resto will give you more survivability but for me it's feral for the quick killing and leveling.</div></div><hr />

If you enjoy cat form you will probably level fastet full feral (14/32/5), if you like grouping and grinding the same instances over and over resto might be for you, or if you enjoy throwing spells around go balance, but balance is easier after 40.</div></div><hr />

Closest one is a warrior who is about 2 levels behind me at the moment.<br />
<br />
I went with feral right from the get go. I would suggest either the 14/32/5 build (or using it to level up) or the 0/30/21 build. Sure you can respec once you ding 60 but when you're leveling, I would suggest filling out the feral tree first (if you're using one of these builds).</div></div><hr />
