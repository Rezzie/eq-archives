So by now, I'm sure you've looked at the patch notes and are crestfallen that once again Druids have not seen much in the ways of fixes/improvements over these past few patches... <br />
<br />
I've just escaped from a design meeting, and I'm here to fill you in on what's coming up for the Druid class. <br />
<br />
A comprehensive talent review -- everything, but Feral Combat in particular -- will be taking place within the next few patches that should aid Druids and give them more choices when specializing. <br />
<br />
Also -- here's a big one, folks -- Feral Form (Cat and Bear) DPS is tasked to be reviewed. They've been researching and comparing damage between Warriors, Rogues and Druids, and they have a better idea now where Druids should fall in the grand scheme of things.... :) <br />
<br />
I'm aware this isn't much as far as specific information goes, but I thought you'd like to know where your class stands on the design team's task list. <br />
