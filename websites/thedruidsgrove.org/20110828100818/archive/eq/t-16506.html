<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordien</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've been gone for almost 2 years and like a heroin addict I'm back.  First thing to do was easy, level up 10 levels to 80.  <br />
 <br />
Second thing of course is the PITA of gear. I saw the nice aug break down so I can slowly work on that.  Now that all my focus affects are junk almost, I need help identifying a few decent focus items.  My guild is somewhere between farming zones so I'm going to be on my own awhile to get the basic focii covered again.  There used to be a really nice breakdown of the latest focus effects and the gear they were on in this forum but I guess it was out of date and removed.<br />
 <br />
Focus effects needed:<br />
Healing <br />
Ben Distance<br />
Ben Spell haste<br />
Detrimental distance<br />
Detrimental spell haste<br />
Ice focus<br />
 <br />
Also, what is an easy charm to get nowadays?  My charm sucks and my box's charm is horrid.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for any help you can give.</div></div><hr />

(lots of good stats including some heroic)<br />
 <br />
You have 55% to fire to 75 so I think that one should hold you over.<br />
 <br />
You could get tss legs and a powersource for the for 30% to heals up to 75 (this is a lateral move but gets you a focus)<br />
 <br />
you could get tss/tbs or sof boots to give you beneficial spell haste 15% to 80 (if you put core in it I believe it bumps to 20%) but my neck is the same as yours and I still love that focus.<br />
 <br />
new sof gloves give you ice focus and arms give you fire focus and helm magic focus all to 35% w/o core!<br />
 <br />
Hope that helps you seem to have solid augs.</div></div><hr />
