<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Benadan Painmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, honestly, with some help, or just doing the drops at my lvls(antonica spirit?) what lvl can i start doin the epic? i'm 35 now, but i've been workin hard, and can probably be up to 39 in a week, how low can i start??<br />
<br />
I could get help from some guildies, get a full group of 49-52's, don't know if thats a great idea, but how soon at least, so i know...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can gather the pieces for the various stages, but afaik the npc's wont talk to you till you are level 50, so you cant do any of the turnins.<br />
<br />
But ya, by all means start working on getting the bits.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Danaere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Epic can be completed at 46. Never been able to get the first NPC (Telin) to talk to anyone below 46. <br />
<br />
Something to note is that even if you complete it, you won't be able to use the effect til you ding 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Firbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Danaere's right. I started my epic at 46 (with Kindly faction towards the first NPC - the rumor that Ally is needed is also incorrect) and completed the quest, receiving the NWS, at 47.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can start by getting your 4 unique forages out of the way.  I believe the Corrupted Mammoth is do-able around 35, although that's probably the only one you should try before your 40s.  You could maybe get the Cyclops and HG drop if you hang around those zones long enough, as many higher level folks farm there for pp and usually let the epic pieces rot.  <br />
<br />
If you're really bored, you could also do some scouting of the various areas that you'll need to camp (e.g. LOIO for Barracuda, etc.)<br />
<br />
Also, try making a few friends now that will be able to help you do some of the tougher fights later on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Benadan Painmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I already have all the forages, and the mammoth and the corrupted HG part done. thats all i can do? i figure i can get all the parts needed, because i can get the venril sathir thingy with a guildie, cause my guild is 90% rangers and they do that fight all the time, maybe i can get one from one of them....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Danaere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Basically you can go loot any of the pieces you can get the mobs to drop. What folks are trying to make sure you understand is that turning them in for the Cleansed Spirits may not work yet. It's been confirmed that they all work at 46, but if someone has done it below 46, they haven't made it very public.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Benadan Painmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Understood, EQdruids says don't try it below 51, and the faction fixes are gonna be fun i think, don't know if i'm ok for all of that, should be, haven't killed much that gives neg. faction, orcs, and of course BB dorfs, Thank you very much to all who have been helping me, i appreciate it very much:) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Danaere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQDruids says that, if I understood the explanation correctly, because when epics were introduced they were &quot;intended&quot; for the 51+ crowd. Since the developers have never said they are &quot;intended&quot; for characters under level 51, Spiritual would prefer not to say it can be done. Part of the reasoning there is that if they are still intended for 51+, but EQDruids says that it can be done at 46, then the devs &quot;fix&quot; it to require 51, and you did your turns ins based on EQDruids information .... that would be unfortunate, and he prefers not to be in that position.<br />
<br />
Again, that is all IF I understood his explanations correctly in the past.</div></div><hr />
