<br />
Stealth to top floor. If all is well so far; regrowth, rejuv yourself, jump down (ignore the 5 hordies/alliances defending the flag), quaff a free action potion, put barkskin on yerself, take flag, cat form SPRINT!<br />
<br />
All this has to be done very fast to work perfect. But if it works you will hear rogues gouging you, warriors charging you etc etc.. while you just run out for the win. :)<br />
<br />
Of course, it's countersmeasures to this kind of tactic (mind control etc) but the thing is to catch them off guard. When peoples stuff dont click they usually panic and just try to hunt you down (hunt down druid with heal, barkskin, free action buff = hard). :)<br />
<br />
I've tried this tactic many times.. and if nothing else.. it keeps 5+ opponents chasing you giving your side an advantage. :)<br />
<br />
I'm not feral specced to feline swiftness.. but i guess a feral druid with feline swiftness would be a monster runner. :)<br />
<br />
Any input?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, we are easly the best class for Flag Runner duty.  When I was level 53 I was still yanking the flag once or twice a match.  I was having the exact same thought about this the other night but havent done WG lately as I've been having so much fun in AV.<br />
<br />
My most consistantly succesful flag runs always have sprint available to get through the tunnels and I always drop in from the top, yank the flag and take off.  I've found a swiftness potion helps more when you are in your own base running to your flag than when it does when you yank the flag from the other base because of stuns, frost nova, and any other movement imparing effects.  Then again, a free action potion is easly as valueable as the speed bonuses.  I've got like 10 of them sitting in my bank as well as a bunch I get from the AH because of how cheap they are.  I do alchemy but im just too lazy to get the herbs.<br />
<br />
To clarify, after rereading.  I stealth in from the top.  Drop down, shift to caster, yank the flag, shift to cat, sprint, out the closest door which is the right exit, shift into cheetah, and take off across the map.  If necessary, use all the environment objects such as the catapults in the field to fake your opponents out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup many times.. 30+ flagpoints on this simple tactic. :)<br />
<br />
Just buff yourself before you jump down.. so you dont have to think about that many factors. :)<br />
<br />
It's not easy.. but it makes the opponents sweat. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are starting to regognize it thou. :(<br />
<br />
It's still effective.. really :) with anouther druid and a hunter as backup.. it flows really good :) (thats 3 offence ONLY..let the other seven just smack all they see and do their thing. :D<br />
<br />
Nice to hear you guys tell me if this tactic worked for you also, or I'm just talking crap ;).</div></div><hr />

I look so forward to trying the &quot;goas druid superbuff immune flag-sprint&quot; move tonight!! And maybe I will be doing this to my enemies  :wavey:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darleeg</div><div class="date">06-30-2005, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is some problems with this method and one of them is cold based snares. Until the next patch, Free Action and Shapeshifting will not prevent coldbased spells from slowing you.<br />
<br />
Also, if there is 5 guarding the flag, you will not get away even with a Free Action potion on. You'll just get mowed down. You need a rogue or another druid distracting them away.<br />
<br />
I've seen rogues and druids feared over and over again that were trying to run for the flag. Until the patch comes out where you can shapeshift and use trinket you are an open target to spammed fears.<br />
<br />
Not knocking this idea, because it is still a good idea to run with a free action potion on. As there is still tons of stuns and slows that it makes you immune to.<br />
<br />
If your team is guarding the middle and successfully holding it, it makes it much easier as that's all the further you have to run.<br />
<br />
If a solo shaman is guarding the flag, with his earthbind totem and frostshock it makes it almost impossible to get away. there is a tactic I use when a shaman is guarding.<br />
I jump down in stealthed cat from the ledge, quickly shift to caster then to bear and feral charge, then bash, shift to caster grab the flag, and then cat with dash.<br />
The shapeshifting should take care of the earthbind effect just long enough.<br />
If you know a rogue or hunter is also guarding then you'll also want to throw in a free action potion and barkskin in the routine. Once outside, rooting is on your side. Even if you have someone rooted you'll want to root the closest to you. or if they are too close you'll want to bump them with natures grasp heh.<br />
<br />
Go Bear from once you are with your party, enrage and regen yourself. <br />
<br />
Once the new patch comes we wont have to worry about their overpowered slowing bugs.</div></div><hr />

Using Sleep on a cheetah is a nighmare for another druid...even they shift they are still asleep for a loooooong time. Too long IMO. Use your mount to catch them and put them in hibernation.</div></div><hr />

And yes.. I've done this with 5 hordes guarding the flag room several times. Maybe I was extremely lucky and they all sucked donkey dick.. but i doubt it.</div></div><hr />

The EASIEST way is to have like 3 warriors run into the room to &quot;grab aggro&quot; and get everyone to attack them.  Then you slip in, grab the flag, and they have no idea what hit them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ah nice. :)<br />
<br />
I still think a hunter backup is good.. as you have already buffed yourself with so many stuffs.. you will take ages to kill (ages in WoW is measured in seconds). If you have a hunter with skill with you he/she have all thoose nifty and frustrations shots and a pet to cause mayhem.<br />
<br />
No I still believe in my strat. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We go on top floor, i stealth in at the flag, when i say go the frost mages jumps down to AOE all he can and when i take the flag he aoo frost nova. That way i really never has to worry about em. <br />
<br />
But another thing is. We need to use our 15 secs of mount speed indoors! If you got your mates ready down the long hall. do that! they cant catch you, exept rogues ofc. and when the 15 secs are up, your probally outside root buff( the one that root when hit.. forgot the name ) and cheetah.</div></div><hr />

Prowl works fine, but is level based. If you are 31 prowling through a room full of lvl 35's, you will be seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah this is something that definitely needed to be brought up.  ENGINEERING is AWESOME!  Especially to reveal those hidden rogues near the flag waiting to sap and stun lock you.  MONEY!!<br />

Goblin Rocket Helm:<br />
<br />
The other day, my guild was raiding UBRS.  We were about to fight a named Dragonkin so one of our mage's put on his goblin rocket helm to take out one of the adds.  It was really awesome.  The rocket helm I assume would be a great way to stop flag runners.  I'm going to do some more research on this.  I'd like try this out.</div></div><hr />
