Slave Pens<br />
Underbog<br />
Mech<br />
 <br />
I am not sure if they are easier as much as especially SP and Mech can be really really short.</div></div><hr />

However the initial phases of Kara can be quite painful.  Once you know it well and have mostly Kara gear you can do things like go into Kara for 3-3.5 hours and down all but 2 bosses (usually Nightbane and Attumen for us because we don't want to mess with them) and get a few upgrades and 19+ badges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arcatraz - Mobs here seem to hit harder than in other heroics (or is it just my imagination?), and that first boss is a pain without shadow resistance.  Luckily, he's skippable if you're just looking to finish your Trial of Tenacity without spending a full repair bill on one boss.<br />
<br />
Mana Tombs - This instance is a PAIN towards the end without humanoid CC (think Shaffar's chamber and the stacking mage debuff) .  Again, the first boss hurts without shadow resistance, but is doable without any.<br />
<br />
Crypts - If you don't have Shackles, don't even think about it unless you've got one hell of a solid tank.<br />
<br />
Shattered Halls - Also a PITA without humanoid CC.  Not to mention that the schizophrenic second boss is just a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Double hard hitters - The Defenders in SP and the Ravenguards on Sethekk Halls come to mind.  These mobs come in pairs, can not be CCed, and hit like TRUCKS.  If you don't have a hunter to dance a mob or a mage to slow kite one, your tank and healer had better to be up to the task of taking both of these at once or you are SOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the general consensus is start Kara then move on to Heroic UB or SP to get more gear.<br />
<br />
If I'm the main healer and a Tree can I do Kara with less say 850 +Healing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If by main healer you mean that the other healers are less geared than you are, then I don't predict that your group will make it very far.<br />
<br />
TBH, running heroics and picking up some badge gear will help you out in Kara A LOT.</div></div><hr />

See it's the chicken or the egg. Run Heroics to gear up for Kara but Kara is easier than most (or all) heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the general consensus is that heroics should be used to gear up for Karazhan.  Only masochists would jump into Karazhan with just level 70 dungeon blues.  I'm not saying it isn't doable ... but it's considerably more difficult!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">warasena,<br />
<br />
I'm in a similar situation.  Just got 70 and there's doesn't seem to be an obvious next step for progression.  After a few hours on wowhead and talking to some experiences players the best answer I've come up with is to run the level 70 normal dungeons until you get your bonus heals over 1200 minimum.  The question I have now is do I need to spend the gold to put high end gems and enchants on gear I know will be replaced pretty quickly in order to hit that level of healing and a similar level of spell damage?<br />

<br />
Run Heroic UB and SP over and over and over.  Use the badges from those to pick up a few epic pieces.  If you can find a good warlock, heroic Mech is a joke too.<br />
<br />
Kara overall is quite easy if you have some people along that know the fights... though I forget what it is like to just start out there, as we have been farming it with groups in t5 / t6 gear for badges for a long time now.  <br />
<br />
I'd shoot for roughly 1200+ healing to go into kara, which shouldn't be that hard to attain.  There are a few pieces of pvp honor gear that will boost your +healing dramatically too.  Check out some of the crafted epic +healing items, as well as rep rewards (CE exalted OH, lower city prayerbook, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-30-2008, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ramparts is considered very easy too and there's a nice piece of resto gear in there, which I can't recall atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">05-01-2008, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah from my limited experience of heroics we find the easiest to do :<br />
<br />
SP - the defenders as has been said are tough but doable. i tank them in pairs and i'm only average geared. bosses seem quite easy to.<br />
<br />
Mech - make sure you have 1/2 cc. bosses here a little harder - the first one if u get positioning wrong with them mine things all over the place and the 2nd one with those damn (quite fast!) elementals running around causing people to get out of range...and clothies seem to die easily here. 4 badges to from here as one in the cache.<br />
<br />
Ramparts - again you need some cc - we're even done it with 1 cc and a druid who is kitty dps but off tanks on the larger pulls. bosses are reasonably straight forward - just watch the adds on the first one they mana drain a lot and our priest found himself oom very quickly last time we ran it. You also get a very very nice feral belt - Tree-Mender's Belt from here so well worth a few runs.<br />
<br />
<br />
We tend to have a variety of geared players as its usually a guildie and I running these with either PUGs or players we know who are not busy raiding ! so sometimes its blue geared people and other times players with pvp epics / kara epics of sometimes better.<br />
<br />
We do find a mage is invaluable for the most reliable form of cc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree on Arca - we wiped 5/6 times on that first boss who is a walk in the park on normal ! tried everything to get healers etc out of LOS of some of his attacks but nothing worked. <br />
<br />
I want to do SV as i enjoy it on normal but when we tried it we had trouble with the first boss as no lock to banish one of the adds who promptly steamrollered over the clothies ! Am told its not really that difficult but the 1st boss is the hardest of the 3 ?<br />
<br />
Looks like we need to try UB as we've not gone their yet on heroic.</div></div><hr />
