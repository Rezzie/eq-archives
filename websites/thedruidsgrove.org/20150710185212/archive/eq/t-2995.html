Neat! 65 ATK outdoors is nice, and it gives Ultravision.</div></div><hr />

Way too easy to slaughter a bucket full of newbies by turning them into wolves and letting the gaurds have at them.<br />
 <br />
  Looks like an okay spell for the level.  Might even be useful in some PoP zones as planes tend to be outdoors but if it stacks like share wolf form then I wouldn't get too excited, share wolf form doesn't stack with primal and some other buffs.</div></div><hr />

I don't see myself using this all that often--I have an ES bracer with free share wolf form and I hardly ever use it.  Large races get mad because they can't slam...alot of people hate the attack animations enough that the atk bonus isn't enough to convince them to use it over sow.  And of course it's outdoor only.</div></div><hr />

I could be mistaken but I think I saw that.  If it is I would have to wonder which one I would cast on myself?  The extra stats could go a long way!<br />

I didn't know any of these lower level spells were in the works.  <br />
<br />
My warrior partner and I love it.  This spell lasts about 2.5 hours, has ultravision, 61 added to attack, faster speed than even SoE.  Very nice indeed.  Best thing is that 2.5 hr length...was annoying to always refresh this buff every 28 mins.</div></div><hr />

His self only greatrer wolf form only gives him like 50 to 60 attack.<br />

I love how long it lasts!</div></div><hr />

It won't stack with avitar. So if you fight with melee who have primal weapons, they won't want you to be casting this buff on them. I wish they would fix that, but I doubt they will. Too bad, I would have used this spell quite often otherwise.</div></div><hr />
