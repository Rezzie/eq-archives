<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaman</div><div class="date">02-11-2009, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just did both these fights ....<br />
we had about 2 groups with us... and i think it was overkill...<br />
now granted... i'm lvl 80 and the groups were made up of toons around lvl 80(give or take a few lvls)<br />
 <br />
the frist mob we droped was for the rain shard, After kill off the 2 guards to awake him the tanks engaged and droped him quick.. so fast that the Lightning Loyalists poped after he dropped... i think the hardest part was getting every1 there (lev kept dropping and a few kept falling off the walls) so we just had them all CoTH there alnog with myself when the groups were ready to fight....<br />
 <br />
the 2nd fight took a little more time (not much) same thing had group 1 go and clear all the trash mobs ... then my group cleard to the bridge to make sure no mobs respawned then i walked up and once in the courtyard the mobs spawned.. group 1 engaged group 2 assisted... and they went down quick (mind &amp; body killing body first) then they took on Gorlakt and we kept the MT healed as he took out Gorlakt.. we had a few Mag casting their DD's and i even got off a DoT or 2 before he went down.. all and all i think we spent more time buffing and getting the groups there then the total time of both fights combined...<br />
 <br />
i was a little nervous going into these fights... but they we're as bad as i thougt... <br />
Just remember to clear the trash mobs first...<br />
 <br />
all i need now is Globe from Anguish and i'm done...<br />
 <br />
also as as side note... the next 2 mobs the 1 in Velk and the wurm in BW ... both soloable i found the mob in Velk in the room past Velketor room in the room where 6 mobs spawn... i just kept kill them till it spawned nothing big about this mob.. hits for about the same as the other mobs that spawn there..<br />
 <br />
the wurm in BW.. after getting him to spawn (spawned when i got close to loc pos 3000, pos 0. i just Dotted and ran.. got off 4 DoTs on him and his hp went down kinda quick... i got hit i think 2 times both nothing to worry about... but i did get kicked once.. it kicks for 5k but it died before it could kick me again.. <br />
 <br />
the hardest part of this quest i think is going to be getting the Globe from Anguish... for 1 this Globe is used by every1 for their 2.0's so inless every1 in the raid has their 2.0 you going to have to pray to the R.N.G. Gods....and hope you roll big ...<br />
 <br />
i'm hoping to start this raid soon.. i'll post back when we do this fight and fill ya in on how it went</div></div><hr />
