<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">05-24-2006, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest thing about 1.11 for druids is the fact that the current 31 point resto talent innervate will become a base skill to be learned by all druids at lvl 40. The talent will be replaced by swiftmend which will use one HoT on a player and heal for the full duration there is a thread that has a deeper discussion of swiftmend (sorry to lazy right now to link it for you) other items of interest are here. http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html <br />
<br />
another couple things of note from my perspective from the general patch notes are key rings, and decay overtime of respec cost by 5 gold per month to a minimum of 10 gold. <br />
<br />
Hope this helped<br />
