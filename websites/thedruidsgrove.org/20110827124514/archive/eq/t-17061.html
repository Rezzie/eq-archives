<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">12-31-2008, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sony is planning in January(or was it March?) to begin voting on a new server. Their news link, is busted at the moment sending you to Everquest 2 at the moment so, I will not bother to link it until it is fixed. I am curious as to your thoughts, what you would like to see, active or retired players as well, as I share my own of what I would like to see(even though I retired, again).<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like a Trilogy Server with Legacy of Ykesha thrown in. That would be Original Everquest, with the original zones as well mind you, using the old Highpass, Commons, Sro, Nro, etc. I would also like to see Keys made to enter zones like Sleeper's again, taking off the current level requirement. I would also like to have Paw put back to gnoll land, as well as the Revamped Cazic Thule, Droga, Nurga stay the same. With Veksar, Jaggedpine, Nedaria's, Stonebrunt, included as well. I would like to see them drop the dragon off the Veeshan's peak off, or severely nerf him. Oddly enough, I would like to see how players can handle current Peak. And Plane of Knowledge disabled.<br />
<br />
With Velious, I would like to see old plane of mischief back again, whether they would hop it back into Temple, we should see(they lost the data they will not get it back). Other things I would like to see, fixing up some things in Velious, like adding ranger/druid plane of growth armor quests. Other things tradeskills specific to the server. All the instancing mobs such as Guard Freklin, removed. I would also like them to add in the % heals as well for consumption, both shaman and druid, as well as droping some levels on spells to smooth out the healing curve starting around level 34.<br />

Your thoughts?</div></div><hr />

And it would help keep corpses from littering alot of places.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't posted in this thread because they are separate topics, but are a bit related.<br />
