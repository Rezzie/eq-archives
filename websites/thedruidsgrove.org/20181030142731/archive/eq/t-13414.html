I'm know about the Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters quests, but has anyone found any others?<br />
<br />
I realize there aren't going to be easy quests with 200HP/mana items but I'm looking for 120-140HP/mana range.  Most of what I have found so far has been too difficult without significant gear/people.  I haven't poked around the new freeport as much as the adventure zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tryon</div><div class="date">03-01-2006, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a couple solo quests that you get in Relic, but are completed in Arcstone easily with a small group.<br />
<br />
In Relic, there are 2 mission NPCs in the merchant area to the left from the Zone in.  Invis and go through the left doorway, then stay to the left through the door.  You will see tents and stuff.  Go to the back lefthand corner to find to &quot;Missions&quot; NPCs.  This area is NON-KOS, so feel free to drop invis once you are passed the 2 KOS MOBs guarding the area.<br />
<br />
One mission is called &quot;crossfire&quot; and results in a 55 hp / 55 mana Augment. <br />
<br />
All you have to do is kill 15 Spirit Stags and 15 Fallen Spirits in Arcstone, loot 4 of their respective No Drop items, and kill Master of the Herd.  Master of the Herd is easy if you have some CC and a tank.  The 3 spirit stags with MotH are rootable too, but they do summon.<br />
<br />
The other mission is called &quot;the needy.&quot;  I have no completed that yet, but it's similar.  Kill X mob Y times, loot Z...but this one doen't tell you what the reward is beforehand.<br />
<br />
Also in Relic, in the arena area (right from the ZI) there is a mission called something like &quot;Champions of the Circles&quot; (can't remember exactly off-hand).  You have to kill 6 named mobs that spawn at certain times of the day in the area.  3 at a time, all within a game day.  They get slightly progressively tougher, but all pretty easy.  All blue cons except final was even to 70.  We did all six without breaking a sweat with a Mage earth pet tanking, a cleric healing pet, me debuffing and nuking, and enchanter slowing.  All level 70 casters, 4 of us.  And the result was a 200 hp/mana necklace with no effects.<br />
<br />
I'll post more later if I think of em.<br />

I have killed quite a few spirit stags and fallen spirits so I'm sure that one should be doable.<br />
<br />
We tried some of the named in Arcstone and killed Ohkan or whatever his name is.  Seems to be a trick to each one just need to learn them.  First time we tried him wasted tons of mana trying to get debuffs to land until we saw the emote when you get him down and he heals up that it switches so now you can use magic on him.   <br />
<br />
Tried the undead guy and he summons all the mobs in the area to him at least i think that is what he was doing as opposed to spawning them, on next try we were going to see how much of the area we could clear before engaging him but respawn seems to be pretty fast in that zone.</div></div><hr />

You will need to kill orcs in the zone until you loot 8 hatchets, then you will need to kill the named chief in the camp. All mobs are kitable, or root/rot. Easily solo'd, just watch out for the curse the orc archanists and oracles seem to cast. Its a nasty dot/snare. <br />

Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stefanie</div><div class="date">03-09-2006, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The orcish logger quest is definetly harder than the crossfire quest in arcstone, but was still able to get it done.  Definelty keep your distance from the oracles and arcanist as their curse is very nasty like the OP stated.<br />
<br />
Would like to add the strategy I used to pull chief who is in a camp with 3 other mobs was to pull him way out and run towards zone out then snare him and zone.  Then I would zone back in and tag him.  Was able to get him alone every time.  You do have to be quick though or he'll poof back to the camp.<br />
<br />
Also when you are running away be sure not to take a shorcut up the steep cliffs to zone out or the whole camp will warp onto you the second you are on the hill.  Most stuff seemed to hit for around 1200 and their resists aren't too bad.</div></div><hr />
