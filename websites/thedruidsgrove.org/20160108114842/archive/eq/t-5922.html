The main reason being that they all expect me to pay double. Living in NZ our money in real spending terms is about the same as people in the US earn but the exchange rate is around 2$NZ to 1$US. Until they consider this I wont ever subcribe to a website.</div></div><hr />

If the auto updater would work I would be happy! I pay for it, but I have no idea why...I can't do anything with my paid version that the free one won't do :( I would love it if it worked, but it seems that they haven't figured out how to get it to work on XP<br />
<br />
If anyone is using that auto update on XP can you let me know?</div></div><hr />

I love the auto update, I have no idea why everyone has problems with it. I've never had any issues with it crashing when I camp out, but I guess thats just because the way I use the program.<br />
<br />
When I go to update, I usually already have EQ running, I just &lt;alt&gt;&lt;enter&gt; and release the mouse from EQ with &lt;shift&gt;&lt;alt&gt;&lt;r&gt;, then minimize EQ, and start the megelo updater like normal, then hit syncronize, check the characters that I want updated (I would have had to switch characters in EQ while the update program was running to show up-to-date listing) and hit ok. Done, sir, done.<br />
<br />
Close out magelo updater, continue my play session like normal.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse I'm wierd too, I guess, because I hardley ever leave EQ, I just leave it running in the bazaar if I dont feel like playing, and minimize EQ while I surf the net, read emails and message boards, or watch a dvd or something.<br />
<br />
BTW: I'm running XP pro, so it shouldn't be an OS issue with Win 2K or XP. I'd look into the stability of your system, maybe just an indication of bad ram or errors on your net connection adapter? Ofcourse, You would ned to make sure that you have all the relevant updates for your OS, system and device drivers.</div></div><hr />

I thought that was explained as something easily fixed with IE settings? I have used Magelo for ages and upgraded to XP right after it was released and never had a problem. From the Magelo FAQ:<br />
<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer 6 Settings<br />
<br />
There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order: <br />
<br />
- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft (Tools -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least once a week for maximum compatibility. <br />
<br />
- Make sure Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Use HTTP1.1 through proxy connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON. <br />
<br />
- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit. <br />
<br />
- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or Norton HOWTOs in the library). <br />
<br />
- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Delete Files. <br />
<br />
- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else. <br />
<br />
- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools -&gt; Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?)</div></div><hr />

I'm not complaining!  Even so, if my subscription ran out I think I would renew.  It's not terribly expensive for a year of access and the autoupdate is awesome for lazy people like Stormlin and me!</div></div><hr />

If you use a proxy server you must change your settings.<br />
 <br />
Under Tools-&gt;Internet Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;HTTP 1.1 Settings:<br />
 <br />
  Use Http 1.1<br />
  Use Http 1.1 through proxy connection<br />
 <br />
that cleared my screen right up :)</div></div><hr />
