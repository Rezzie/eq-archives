2 x Blessed Tanzanite (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30552#dropped-by)<br />
1 x Mystic Dawnstone (or one of the Steady green res/stam gems if you prefer ... I use my yellow sockets to stack resilience)<br />
<br />
if you want the socket bonus.  Otherwise, just stick in a Steady green res/stam gem in each socket.<br />
<br />

ETA: If you're socketing this for PvE, then definitely go with<br />
<br />
2 x Teardrop Living Ruby<br />
1 x Luminous Noble Topaz<br />
<br />
Do not ... DO NOT ... stick purple gems in those red sockets for PvE.  IMO in 2.4 no resto druid or healing priest should be putting purple gems into red sockets except for to satisfy meta requirements (which your boots will cover anyway, with the Chess and Leo boots each having two blue sockets).</div></div><hr />

Glad you posted that, because I found the gems before I came back to the forum to read the replies, and that's what I went with.  :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK you can purchase any of the epic gems from this vendor for 15 BoJ each.<br />
<br />
Link to the NPC page on Wowhead: http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=25950<br />
<br />
But yeah ... my realm is also at about 40%.  No one is doing their dailies anymore since the Smith badge items were unlocked and everyone has hit exalted with SSO.</div></div><hr />

we're upto 60% now so luckily we must have enough people still doing daily's for rep and cash.</div></div><hr />

Jewelcrafters can buy over 1300g worth of new recipes from the gem vendor and you can buy any of the gems for 15 badges of justice.... and noob idiots are still trying to sell them for like 400g on the trade channel.</div></div><hr />

I bet they still sell them for 400g.  Sure hardcore folks have all the badges they want, but casual players don't.  I can get 400g in a few days (with almost zero effort), but it would take me a couple of weeks to get 15 badges (I only run 1-2 heroics per week).  If I could buy 15 badges for 400g, I'd do it in a second.  In fact, I'd pay 600-800g for 15 badges.</div></div><hr />

/agreed<br />
<br />
<br />
as i've been saying in my badge spending thread i dont rack up badges like they are going out of fashion so 15 for one gem is a heck of a lot where as a few hundred gold is 1/2 days doing daily's !<br />
<br />
my badges will be going on the items mentioned in may other thread but for the chance of some quality epic gems i'll be keeping my eye on the AH and seeing how low they go with many people probably tryin to sell them :grin: <br />
<br />
sure they will start off sill money, prob over 500g but hopefully they will drop to sub 300g within a week as the novelty factor wears off.</div></div><hr />

It is those of us that just want to improve our gear (for fun rather than need) that would probably end up buying them.</div></div><hr />

If I had an unlimited supply of badges, I'd build up my Kitty and healing kits.  Even though I rarely use them.</div></div><hr />
