<br />
Dire Bear FTW<br />
<br />
I ended up running SM a few more times for the silver and stuff, but im still getting experience for it at 40...<br />
<br />
where can i go to get MINIMAL experience and maximum $$$ from drops?<br />
<br />
i want minimal experience becuase i don't want to level from grinding, i want to level from questing, and enjoying the storylines the game offers... i also KNOW that if i hit 42 i'd probably end up spending hard earned gold on spells before i got my mount...<br />
<br />
what do you guys suggest?<br />
<br />
If it makes any difference, I'm Horde...</div></div><hr />

If you have any gathering professions (Skinning, Mining, Herbalism, Fishing, and maybe even Enchanting) you could do the following:<br />
<br />
Skinning : My favorite gathering profession. Go grind stuff and skin and AH the leather for profit? Iirc the turtles in Shimmering Flats of 1kNeedls skin for Heavy Leather and they're vendor drops are worth quite a bit too.<br />
<br />
Mining : : Go on some mining runs. I personally don't have too much experience in Mining but I'm sure you could find a nice route to get some ore.<br />
<br />
Herbalism : Like mining, go on herb routes. Swamp of Sorrows (just run around in a circle) has a nice route for Fadeleaf, Blindweed, Goldthorn and Liferoot. Can't remember exactly what level the mobs are. Fadeleaf will probably be your big product from this area.<br />
<br />
Fishing : Go farm some Deviates (always seems to be a steady income), Stonescale Eels and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Enchanting : This one will be a bit tougher for your level since you can't really farm instances like SM to disenchant everything. Maybe with the help of a higher level friend you could run SM repeatedly and disenchant stuff.<br />
<br />
I haven't really checked the Auction House too much lately but these methods might not be a okay income anymore because they're not as heavy in demand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im skinning and leatherworking. I've been up in the Alterac Mountains owning the yeti's for their heavy leather and silver drops... im at 50 gold right now after the past 2 days of steady grinding... this is going to take FOREVER at that rate. I think i'll head over to shimmering flats the next time i log on...<br />
<br />
my leatherworking skill has started to catch up to my skinning skill a lilttle though... my LW was way behind because of the mistake of choosing blacksmithing with skinning early on... Barbaric shoulders has been the biggest money maker for me so far... i may just start dumping the raw heavy leather though...</div></div><hr />

Any Humanoids drop Cloths, so I'd go with Ogres or Trolls (Alterac, Badlands, Tanaris, Hinterlands) of your level.<br />
<br />
And don't get caught up in a price war.  There will always be some nub who radically undersells Cloth stacks.  Scan the Auction House, find an acceptable middle ground, and choose your price.  Stick to your price.  Do a reality check at Allakhazam.com .<br />
<br />
Mageweave Cloth is great for Tailors, First Aid leveling, and probably some Engineering schematic requires it.  (Since I've seen Linen, Wool and Silk in certain Engineering schematics.)<br />
<br />
If you skin, that's a bonus.  In the good ol' days when people grinded Argent Dawn rep, buyers needed huge quantities of Rugged Leather.  Keep it in mind if you're lvl 50 and still need a mount.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Hunters and Druids already have innate speed bonuses, so it's not the end of the world if you don't get your mount at lvl 40.  I found the mount to be very useful at lvl 50, when I was running away from the zombies in WPL.</div></div><hr />

I saved 80g at lvl 40 but then spent it all on spells and items in AH.<br />
I then thought 'I have cheetah, who cares' so i lvled up a bit in tanaris.<br />
I then discovered ZF :). good drops. sell for quite a bit, some good leather gear for druids aswell, i got my mount after 3 runs of ZF and 2 hours of skinning grinding off the scorpids/hyenas/basilisks in tanaris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">02-19-2007, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My #1 tip for those trying to make money:<br />
<br />
STAY AWAY FROM THE AUCTION HOUSE IF YOU CANNOT RESIST BUYING GEAR.<br />
<br />
The first item I bought was Blanchard's Stout @ lvl 43. Sure it's fun to go gear and weapon shopping but you can get great gear from instances and quests (moreso in Outlands)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lumbergh</div><div class="date">02-19-2007, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skwidrific, a couple more things that came to mind:<br />
<br />
When grinding for dollars, go to a zone where the mobs are a couple levels lower than you.  So if you're 48, go to a 45-46 zone.  This will reduce your downtime (i.e. healing yourself or mana-water drinking).  And you won't die if you pickup an add.<br />
<br />
If you're diligent with grinding (i.e. doing it for 2 hours non-stop), chances are that a green item (or even a blue) will drop.  Don't be bashful when putting it on the Auction House.  Check Allakhazam for prices, and you'll make money fast.  One blue item could bring in 20g or more, depending on the item's level.<br />
<br />
If you can, pick an enemy that's not noisy.  I hate those noisy, electroshocking birds in Winterspring.  All elementals are quiet (earth, water, fire) and you can take them down easily.  <br />
<br />
Beasts are great because they keep attacking you until they die.  Some humanoids may run, so have your Moonfire handy to finish them off.</div></div><hr />

Allakhazam.com is very helpful in that regard as well.<br />
<br />
Vendor trash sells better and better the higher level the mob, and the whites and greens are the same.<br />
<br />
Leather always seems to sell well on my server as well.<br />
<br />
I actually came up with mount and training money before I hit 40, then banked it with an alt to avoid spending it on gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, make sure you have lots of empty bag slots before you grind, and keep all vendor trash.  Set your hearth to the closest town, so you can mail the non-vendor-trash to your bank alt.  Rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">04-04-2007, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont forget to always loot those grey items as well some of them will attually suppise you in what they are worth.  Cant tell you how many times I have seen people not loot grey items.  Alot of times those items can be worth a gold or more.  Just make sure you know what they are worth before you start skipping them to save room.  The stackable greys can really add up as well.</div></div><hr />

I got my mount at 60 on my druid and hunter.  With travel form, it's nice, but not an absolute must have like spells.<br />
<br />
#2 If you don't care that much for LW, dump it, take herbalism and sell them and skins.  Mining actually makes more gold selling than skinning, but my toons do skinning/mining.<br />
<br />
#3 At 60+ in outlands, you'll make enough to EASILY cover your flying mount plus an epic ground mount unless you need to buy loads.<br />
<br />
#4 Resist buying every enchant/upgrade/etc possible. You will get mone money that you ever need.<br />
<br />
Now, if you want to get the mount sooner than 60, just sell and wait a few levels. It costs the same gold at 40 as at 70, but gold comes in faster at higher levels.<br />
<br />
Now a must have for me at 40+ are then new netherweave bags, 16 slot. At 8g or so AH prices, they are great. I then can loot all and sell and not trash items. The stackable drops (not all but most) actually bring in quite a bit over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup, skip it, seen many druids skip it to save for the epic mount. I bought it tho, but got the gold at lvl 42</div></div><hr />

I did herbalism/skinning and had mount money by just over 30.  But I'm dependent on my friends for potions, gear, and enchants.  (And I almost always just sell on AH).</div></div><hr />

Actually given the state of MMOs, this makes sense.  There is a limited need for any given item.  You use it for 5-10 levels and its gone.  Its disposable.  Granted the raw materials are disposable as well, but for someone leveling LW, you need have a metric TON of materials to work with.  So the demand to build a specific item is low.  The demand for the raw materials is high because people want to level their LW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For any other item you are right. But with heavy leather it is another story. Heavy leather is necessary to push you reputation with the Thorium Brotherhood. I can remember I bought hundreds when I needed to level LW. <br />
Nowadays I am not so sure whether heavy leather still sells.<br />
<br />
The best place to farm heavy leather is Stranglethorn. From BB go north along the street and then easy to the gorillas. The are easy to kill, they drop some greys that sell well, you get heavy leather out of them and there are enough of them to have no downtime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding on to this. Since the release of The Burning Crusade I've noticed gathering professions had a big boost in the economy. Like Allahanastar mentioned, more people will buy materials to leel up their professions.<br />
<br />
Mining is an awesome gathering profession at the moment. It supports Engineering, Blacksmithing and Jewelcrafting. Since JC is fairly new still there might be still some people slowly leveling it up.</div></div><hr />

They drop scales or something that are worth quite a bit at vendors and also drop greens every now and then which add to the pool. I ended up getting my mount about level 41 and it was easy but still a fairly long grind if you hate grinding. <br />
<br />
Not many new players have a mount at 40, but you need to get at least the training sometime because you need it for the epic training and you need this for flight form. Flight form is essential as well and a lot of fun :) I mainly use flight form now rather than my epic mount even though it is slower. If I had an epic flying mount it might be a different story but I think that epic flying form will be out by then so i'll be twice as happy :)</div></div><hr />

I was getting somewhat worried about my lack of funds.  I spend my money on training, and that's getting more and more expensive as I level.  Fortunately, I am a big fan of my travel form, so I can live without my mount until I hit the Outlands.  Right now, I think I will focus on making myself stronger so that I can SURVIVE in the Outlands!  :)</div></div><hr />

Finish as many quests as you can and even the group ones. Definitely do the instances ones because they usually give you about 10 or more gold per quest AND you earn some money from instancing from the grey--&gt;green drops and the blues you might keep / DE.<br />

Farm mats w/ your gathering profession.<br />

Also grinding daily quests also give quite a bit of money but here is the real tip. All skinners out there rejoice! Go skin in netherwing ledge. The mobs there give skins needed for a daily quest to gain rep with the netherwing and the skins go on our server for about 2 gold a piece.</div></div><hr />
