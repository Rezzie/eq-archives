<br />
Long time lurker, noob poster, <br />
<br />
Im currently tanking instances and getting attuned to Karazhan and my guild is looking to at least have a look at Kara this week.  It is likely I will be MT at least some of the time and either OT or DPS.  Will I need to start collecting resistance gear for Kara and or for some of the end game instances?  If so can you guys give me a little advise?<br />
<br />
I have a little Fire resistance but nothing else, also is it worth trying to keep Defence up to as near 415 as possible.</div></div><hr />

Fire/frost resist I suppose wouldn't hurt for Shade of Aran in Karazhan but I don't use it really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's really no need for resist gear in Kara, and my guild has cleared it numerous times ( though this weekend was a first having 2 groups clear through Prince :) )</div></div><hr />

Necessary.  Becoming and staying uncrittable should be the first thing you do.  Then start to build up stam and dodge.</div></div><hr />

I have the Defence rating just starting to swap out items for +Stamina and Agilty as said, but thought I should find out about Resistance, is there a magic number (i.e 415 for defence) or is it more a case of what gear you can find that dosn't gimp your Stamina and Defence and armour too much.<br />
<br />
I still have a way to go, still need rep to get earthwarden and still need to work on my gear, but time is something I don't have much of atm.<br />

Its so many SteamVaults runs for me that I don't even like to think about them.  I think I estimated it around 10-15 more runs for me.  Ugh.. probably more because most people don't like to take the time for a full clear for rep.</div></div><hr />

+def should be easier to get than +resil though 8)</div></div><hr />

Naw... just form an arena team.  Then play 10 games per week.  Wait 6 weeks and you get decent +Resilence.  If your winning in Arena, you get it sooner.<br />
<br />
Arena is nice.. its just pretty much free epics if you do the minimum and are patient.  its pretty much how I made up the difference on my +Defense.  I think mine sits at like 405 defense, but I have a 44 resilence which pushes me way over the top.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling you are a PvE:er.</div></div><hr />

Indeed.  However, I find that I really enjoy Arena, but I'm just not effective in it.  I'm getting better.  I'd like nothing better than to be on a dedicated arena team, but most of the people who I know and do it with are just in it for the free epics.  Its fairly easy for a casual player to get decent epics if they take their time.<br />
<br />
I like the BG too.  AV is still my favorite place to go.</div></div><hr />

Nothing beats being on a good team as a druid tbh. After some fights.. people realize you are a valuable class. ;)</div></div><hr />

Is there a comprehensive list of druid tank/dps resistance gear somewhere? I would appreciate any help, a link or a couple of key items I should aim to get.<br />
<br />
Thanks a million. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">07-23-2007, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like that too. As we approach SSC, I was looking for frost/nature gear on Thottbot. But there is none to speak of. There is no leather gear that is close to the plate gear that warriors/pallies get. Some items from before BC, an lots of greens. That's all.<br />
<br />
At least I couldn't find anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nitronaf</div><div class="date">08-12-2007, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi<br />
My name is Morpholic and im a feral druid<br />
I have currently cleared SSC TK and anything before<br />
I did the old attunement way for these instances aswell<br />
I am currently 4/9 in black temple and 4/5 in hyjal <br />
<br />
From my experience in these instances u hardly need any resist at all<br />
<br />
(KAR)CURATOR: bit of arcane for curator is ok but not really needed unless healers are heavily undergeared<br />
(SSC)HYDROSS: about 175 frost and nature mix is required for tanking hydross adds<br />
(EYE)ALAR its a rumor and nothing more that u need fire resist for the eye. U need NONE. I tank Alar in 0 fire resist. on ocassion i equiped about 70FR and it did help but really isnt necessary for the fight. <br />
(EYE)SOLARIAN: Max arcane resist is required for tanking the arcane debuff/mark in this fight. Usually ferals tank her tho.<br />
(HYJAL) None required here. Altho if you are tanking the adds from anatheron u will require about 200 FR<br />
(BLACK TEMPLE)Mother Sahara: Max Shadow resist is required for this fight.<br />
<br />
Hope this info helps you up and coming druids out there <br />
dont stress too much about resist gear until u start pulling magtheridon.</div></div><hr />
