Healing (Defensive) - increases heals by 25%, while reduces dps by 50%.<br />
DPS (Offensive) - increases dps by 25% while decreasing heals by 50%.<br />
Normal - The way a Druid is now.<br />
 <br />
The stated goal of SoE is to make a Druid 80% as effective as a Cleric for healing.<br />

Group heals, gorup HoTs, Divine arbitration... they would have to match the druid CH and fast heals to the cleric ones for it to be even close, but a heal boost wouldn't go unappreciated =P</div></div><hr />

Would need grp heals and more comparable cleric tools to be 80% as effective on healing.</div></div><hr />
