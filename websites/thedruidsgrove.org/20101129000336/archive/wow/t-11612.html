<br />
I'm level 63 and almost completely balance-specc'd with a few points in restoration, and zero in feral.  So I do almost all of my damage with spells.<br />
<br />
My question is about the Fairy Fire spell.  I know it reduces armor.  My question is, does armor affect the amount of damage done by spells?  Is it worth it for me to cast fairy fire on an enemy if I won't be engaging in melee?  Will their reduced armor cause them to take more damage from my wrath/starfire/roots/insect swarm, or is it just a waste of mana?<br />
<br />
Also, of course I have to watch my mana carefully.  What do people think the most mana-efficient damage spell is, in terms of damage done per mana point used?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any tips!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they stack resistance, that's how you would be doing lower damage with spells.<br />
<br />
If they have 0 armor or 15,000 armor your spells will still do the same ammount of damage.<br />
<br />
Fairy fire would be best used as a balance druid while in a group.  When you are solo, I wouldn't do it as much unless you are a meleekin as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look for spell penetration stuff, or items that reduce your targets magic resistances.  Moonkins are a bit better off in PvP, and maybe PvE, as few ppl / mobs have arcane or nature resist gear (that they wear at least.  Shadow and Fire resist gear are more common).</div></div><hr />

FF is a MUST against Rogues and other Druids imo.</div></div><hr />

FF isn't really as big a deal now as it was before because of CloS only being on a 1 min CD. Still, i can't think of a reason not to use it.. but it doesn't prevent vanish really. :)</div></div><hr />

With an added 3% to hit from melee, you allow your melee classes to drop some gear with +hit on it and  pick up more attack power/crit gear, thus increasing their dps.  Not to mention, most tanking gear lacks +hit in lieu of +def or +dodge.  The more the tank hits, the easier time he has holding aggro.  It's a sorta 'sell yourself' talent that helps you secure that raid spot over another caster class.</div></div><hr />
