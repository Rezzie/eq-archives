<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know there are a lot of these &quot;out there&quot; but with the new non-transfer server starting up soon I thought it might be helpful to compile a brief list of some low-level stuff to get people started if they choose to migrate.<br />
<br />
A couple of my favorite lowbie quests:<br />
<br />
Shadow Haven faction and xp (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1534)<br />
<br />
Bandit Sashes in South Qeynos (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=499)<br />
<br />
Of course, various Newbie Armor quests are quite rewarding, but those will be very overrun to begin with I'd imagine.<br />

<br />
Easy to do and all bits are droppable and often found on merchants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>willain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can also talk to the armor quest givers of other classes and get those equipment boxes as well.  Or, you could the last time I started a new character.  Nice to not spend you first plat on a couple backpacks.</div></div><hr />
