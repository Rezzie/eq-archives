<br />
Just wondered if anyone knows the weak spot on DK's i can exploit, as every time i get into a battle with one they seem to come out on top.<br />
<br />
im balance spec so hit them with all my burst to start with which usually gets them down to half thier health but from there on in they just kick my butt<br />
<br />
hope you guys can help here is my armoury page (mainly pve gear but will be working on pvp gear from now on)<br />

<br />
The only time I have been able to get a DK is in Kitty form when the DK was too dumb to trinket out of the stun.  Pounce, rake, mangle, Maim, Tiger's Fury, Berserk, shred, shred.....hope to god he hasn't come to yet!</div></div><hr />

Other than that, the only thing i can do is to rant about how broken that class is. I'm not sure which spec(s) give them a percentage of health back from damage dealt, and they apparently have something called &quot;runetap&quot; which gives them health from their runic power.<br />
My rogue team-mate and I take one down by doing our best to keep him stunlocked. Last night we went up against a hunter/DK combo. We got the hunter down first, but shortly thereafter, my teammate died. popping all my CD's in bear form, I can go toe-to-toe with a DK until, like you said, he gets to 50%. At that point, it goes from a bad dream to a nightmare. I disengaged, and ran off to heal myself (Frenzied Regen being on CD). He sent his worms after me (this happened twice) and runetapped, so he was back up to full health when i resumed attack. With FR and Berzerk on CD, my only defense was Barkskin... Once that was done, so was i :(<br />
<br />
Maybe Nature's Grasp and Roots to keep you out of his range? I'm not even sure what their range is, tbh...<br />
<br />
I'll do a little more research for both our sakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, the only class I have seen regularily scare a DK is a Frost Mage.  There endless snares, and really really hard crits, combo to make them tricky for a DK.  Druids are pretty much SOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlord</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use nature grasp and RUN!!! like you said <br />
<br />
Then BANG!!!! i right back at his feet cos he uses death grip then mind freeze so i cant cast the spell i want. I think next time i come up against one ill just type /sleep and let him get on with it lol<br />
<br />
it just seems hopeless they seem too powerfull AND they have been nerfed slightly so i must be doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just because they've been nerfed doesn't mean that they're not still an utterly brokenly OP class.<br />
<br />
My rogue team-mate and i have come to the conclusion that if we run across a pally/dk combo, our best bet is to just lay down and take it like men... it will save us a ton of frustration.<br />
<br />
If you're running 2's, and you run into a DK combo (ANY DK combo) i'd say your best bet is to kill the non-DK first and hope both of you live to take down the DK afterwards.</div></div><hr />

Because they have<br />
- 2 silences<br />
- death grip<br />
- shackle<br />
- 2 pets (ghoul and gargoyle)<br />
- sacrifice ghoul for 40% of their max. hp<br />
- DoTs doing massive damage through any armor<br />
- Plate Armor<br />
- 26k hp in full pvp-gear<br />
- boneshield<br />
<br />
so thats that^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yeah... silly me :banghead:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlord</div><div class="date">03-03-2009, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i have respecced to feral (was balance) and have been sat in bgs ever since and as you can imagine i have come across quite a few dks and so far the kill to death ratio is about 2-1 to me.<br />
<br />
i have found that with all the buffs from the start im sat around 7-8k AP. my gear aint great but it seems more than enough to cope with what a dk can dish out. <br />
<br />
i forgot how much fun being a kitty was as i have been balance since lvl 60. and as dks are caster killers going feral seemed to be the only option.<br />
<br />
i will try work out the best method by dueling and post it here :)</div></div><hr />

I also ran into a human in Ashenvale and it was on from jump... I died while the DK was around 49% health... I'll be improving my resil a little this week, and with some Vault love next tuesday (stuff HAS to drop for me soon, dammit) i should be right around 675 or 700 or so in the next couple weeks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is, resilience has so little damage mitigation right now, compared with the damage-output of classes, <br />
that u wont notice that big of a difference i supose. :banghead_</div></div><hr />
