On the other hand, you dont get anything out of kings from attack power, but on strength, you do.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd keep the Pathfinder's, but as you say there is so little difference it barely matters.. :&gt;<br />

Grats on Angelista's !  Lock up your clothies =)<br />

There are 3 Group[5] quest, but it is such a pain to get a group together for those, I consider them more difficult to obtain than a raid reward.  Plus they are only slightly better than what I already have.<br />
<br />
My weak guild did just killed Mag over the weekend (he was easier than I thought he would be), so I stand a good chance at getting the Ring of the Recalcitrant (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28791).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Furthermore, 2 of 3 quest rings are Aldor only.  I'm a scryer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">08-19-2008, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just using the list you linked, these are all easily obtainable:<br />
Vindicator's Band of Triumph (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33919) - 12k honor battlegrounds reward<br />
Adal's Command (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29177) -  The Sha'tar - Exalted<br />
The 2 Ring (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34837) - BoE, from daily fishing quest<br />
Shapeshifter's Signet (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30834) - Lower City - Exalted<br />
Slayer's Mark of the Redemption (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31077) - Scryer quest reward<br />
Hard Khorium Band (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34361) - BoE, only costs you gold<br />
<br />
Some of these are only slight upgrades in raw DPS, but have other beneficial stats like stamina which your ring has none of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now the only one I'm considering is Guardian's Band of Triumph (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=35131), but I'm in no hurry.  So, an AV here or there and I'll have the 15K honor.<br />
<br />
The exalted rep rings will not happen as I can't tell you the last time I ran a lower city or sha'tar rep 5-man.  I'm not even Revered with either facation.  The last ring cost almost 10K gold (according to wowhead) and I'm not willing to spend all that much on my kitty gear.  I might try to solo the scryer ring.  Or, if I'm lucky, snipe the 2 ring off the AH for cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so thats about 10,000g ! lol</div></div><hr />

However, I was able to beg a few guildies into helping with the last two steps.<br />
<br />
So, now I have the Slayer's Mark of the Redemption (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31077) and 143 hit.  Woot!  No misses!  That said, I'm gonna work on the PvP ring in my spare time.<br />
<br />
FWIW, the last step of that quest chain is bugged for druids.  When you shift into form you &quot;lose&quot; the disguise.  Thankfully, after each fight you just need to remove/put-on the disguise again and you are set.  Unless everyone in your party has the disguise on, just make sure you get the killing blow on the &quot;main&quot; giant (not his spawn).  I told my party members to stop DPS'ing at 10% and work on the spawn while I finished the main giant.<br />
<br />
We had to kill 7 giants for me to get the 5 kills.  Mostly due to the disguise issue.</div></div><hr />

You'll need an arena rating of 1650 for that.  You can still pick up the Vindicator (S3) and Vengeful (S2) rings for honor with no arena rating and a reduced amount of honor.<br />
 <br />
The S3 one is nice with the armor pen crit and ap as well to stack with your Angelista's.</div></div><hr />

The wowhead data is wrong, it is sold by PvP vendors.</div></div><hr />

The vendor requires a 1650 rating to purchase the ring, but when you link the item it doesn't show a rating requirement.  Weird.</div></div><hr />

Arena rating honor reward, or crafting which requires 5x sun motes. Not verified, but I'm guessing the crafted ring doesn't have an arena rating. Anyone know?<br />
<br />
FWIW, I did see it for sale in Org last night when I was buying my Vindicator's Ring of Triumph. :&gt;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, it's sold specifically in Org for horde, same place where you get the Merciless Gladiator gear, and yes it still requires the arena rating... (and yes im struggling to get to that rating :banghead: )</div></div><hr />
