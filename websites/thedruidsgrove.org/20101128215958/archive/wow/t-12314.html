are these placing based on raw data? or is the item's potential calculated such as the possible gems addition or enchantments?</div></div><hr />

He has a forum mentioned on the first page where you can ask.  But if I had to guess, I'd say the gems are included in the item's value.  Otherwise &quot;Necklace of the Deep&quot; would not be the 4th item on the neck list.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I see the the first column contains a &quot;base&quot; value for socketed items that is much lower than the assigned value.  More evidence that the suggested gems are included in the item's ranking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both Bear and Cat mitigation lists assume that no healing is available. This emphasizes the value of Stamina as it makes you last longer. However, there is no meaningful way of representing healing, so it is better to have a clear understandable model (that you can then easily compare against) than a complicated one. However, until you have enough Stamina, the value is appropriate as it represents the buffer Health gives you against damage spikes.I can understand making this assumption on kitty gear (maybe), but not on bear gear.</div></div><hr />
