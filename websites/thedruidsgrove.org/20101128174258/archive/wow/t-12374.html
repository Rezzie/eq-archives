Actually, the pejorative &quot;newfag&quot; is a merciful appelation. It presumes the reason you don't grok is because you're new. If however you at not in fact new... HANG YOUR HEAD IN SHAME.<br />

Posting things like this encourages cliquey behaviour which I would assume is exactly what we DONT want at the druid grove.  (ie if only a select few know what it means, it serves to exclude others from the progress of the conversation).  But just for the sake of curiousity, what exactly are you trying to express by posting it?  That's the second time I've seen you post it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">02-21-2008, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While Annikk might be well informed in regards to WoW, it's things like this that make me think he has some sort of mental problem. See, I never - ever - said that the pic of Julia Fitzgerald was common knowledge, ignorance of which proves one is uncool. Now, if you're not going to listen to what I say, and instead are going to believe what I do not say, you are so ridiculously incorrect I can't help but speculate on the list of mental handicaps that might be the cause.<br />
<br />
It's not &quot;a pic of Julia Fitzgerald.&quot; It's a picture of a woman making a stupid face that makes her look unintelligent. Perhaps if I macro'd it up you'd comprehend the meaning? The following is not &quot;a pic of Frank the Cat.&quot; Let's see if you're clever enough to tell me the meaning and purpose of this picture:<br />
