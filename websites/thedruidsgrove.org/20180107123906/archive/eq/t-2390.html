Med to full, go out, grab 8 wolves, blast til all are dead, you should be at 20m.<br />
Repeat.<br />
<br />
Timorous deep:47-50/51: buy your level 49 ae spell first. Bind along the beach near the aviak spire. port to nexus get kei, gate back, and start with 4, see how low you get on mana, if you have 60m or so after 4, med to full, and grab 8 the next time.<br />
<br />
thats what I did, except i grouped from 47-49...but I probobly should have done this for fast leveling. Just realise there is really no loot at all at these spots, so after a few levels KEI will really start to hurt the bank.</div></div><hr />

Easy to single or double pull most of the time. can solo, or group (Necros a GREAT partners here as these are all undead)</div></div><hr />

They give very nice xp up to 47-48 and repop pretty quickly.  Also, when I quadded them in OOT, I would usually run over to Seafury Isle and grab a cyclops to Root/DoT in between quads.  Nice loot to boot.<br />
<br />
Burning woods is a fun place as well, but I would only do bugs (and mainly Ash and Cinder at that) until you get your lvl 49 quadding upgrade.  At that point, everything else is fair game.<br />

You can also quad stonegrabbers there. Usually at 49 you will get 4% per quad.<br />
Even at 53 you can quad em for AA xp</div></div><hr />
