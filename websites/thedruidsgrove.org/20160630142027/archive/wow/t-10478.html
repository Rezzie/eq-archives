My tanking weapon is Warden Staff with +15 str enchant.<br />
<br />
These are the Options:<br />
<br />
Fist of Omokk:  29str 12sta<br />
Bonecrusher:  30str 1% crit<br />
Crystal Spiked Maul:  16str 2% crit<br />
<br />
I currently have the first two, and it seems that the third isnt hard to get.  Before I use up all the mats for the +25agr ench, I'd like to make sure that I am putting it on the best feral weapon.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My votes for The Unstoppable Force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unstoppable Force is nice for sure, though at the moment I  have neither the time nor patience to get dominated in AV constantly (alliance wins about 1 out of 25 matches on my server).  All the time that I have to devote to WoW is spent in Molten Core, ZG, or Onyxia's Layer, or helping the lower lvl people in my guild / gathering herbs for pots / gold for repair bills.  I plan on bg'ing a lot in a few months, after I have gotten better endgame gear, and have a decent feral set to go with it as well.  Maybe I can get UF then.<br />
<br />
Plus I cant use the UF weapon proc (stun) in forms.  Though to be sure it certainly has better stats.  And all three weapons I mentioned are free, whereas the Unstoppable Force has to be bought for a rather significant amount of gold.  <br />
<br />
So, has anyone here done the math to determine whether Bonecrusher or Crystal Spiked Maul are better?  I'm pretty sure Fist of Omokk is out of the question.  Thanks =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was considering buying the Unstoppable Force and slapping a 25agil enchant on it for cat form, but I doubt I would remember to swap between the two half the time. <br />
<br />
If your choices are between the bonecrusher and crystal spiked I would choose the crystal spiked for the 2% crit. I forget what the stats are to get 1% crit but I am fairly certain its a big number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clari what is your AP not counting the weapon?<br />
The math works out that if your AP is over 900 you get better returns on focusing on raising your crit and agility, and lower than that on raising your strength.<br />
<br />
So if you have over 900AP get the spiked maul and put agility on it, if you have less, get the bonecrusher and put strength on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really doesnt take that many games of AV to get TUF. With TUF alone, I gain 3.25% crit chance with the 2% crit on the weapon and a +25 agi enchant on it. Combine that with the str/sta already on the weapon and it makes for a mean feral cat weapon. I would suggest not spending the money to get a +25 agi enchant on one of those weapons and save it for when you get TUF.<br />
<br />
BTW, 20agi = 1% crit. I havent bothered enchanting my Warden Staff yet because I really only equip it in bear when I want the armor bonus. If I want to kill things in bear, I keep the TUF on.</div></div><hr />

I think my 2h mace skill is at like 100 &gt;.&lt;. I will just zip up behind you in cat (don't be in bear ok!), and we can test this out to see if it really is effective =))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give me another week.  I should have exalted this weekend ;)<br />
<br />
And you don't want me in bear?  :( I've only got about 9k armor ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">04-21-2006, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I did it....and um....wowsers, I think I like it =). I actually swapped out of cat to bear cause some mage trapped me and I popped her for 630 dmg with the mace....just wow! (she died on that hit btw lol...)<br />
<br />
So anyways ya the TUF + 25agil enchant makes for a nice feral weapon to say the least haha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-21-2006, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another point I wanted to bring up to all you druids out there that spaz over the huge armor in bear form. AC is great for tanking a mob, in fact, its fantastic when tanking a melee dmg mob when you have that much AC.<br />
<br />
...Its not so fantastic when you have 9k AC and are hitting for 300dmg against an epic warrior in PvP, or any caster for that matter. By driving your AC up that high, you are losing out on alot of good gear that will increase your damage. Id say stick around 7k AC and start getting your strength and crit up. When you start hitting for 800-900 damage on a crit maul, youll thank me.<br />
<br />
Your better off avoiding &quot;tanking&quot; in group PvP and using cat form to kill the cloth wearers. Use bear to feral charge and soak up damage when you need to but use cat form and kill the healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">04-21-2006, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta disagree there heh. I balance the two because generally the bear is a large target that acts like a magnet for other players. This gets their support destroyed while everyone is smashing me. At 8300ish armor I am hitting cloth wearers for 800-900 crits, and easily wear down almost every warrior/paladin in plate. Epics are epics and when its Tier2 vs. Tier0 you are going to get destroyed in cat form by the first warrior or rogue that targets you. <br />
<br />
The point I am trying to make is it's not always about the killing blows but about acting like a team and increasing your survivability, as well as those around you. There are just as many that spaz over high AC as those who spaz over big ravage numbers. I have learned that pvp and bg advice should usually be taken with a grain of salt, the dynamics of the situation, the players around you, and your playstyle is going to dictate how you pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-21-2006, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good points. However, on my server, no one bothers attacking the druid in bear form. Why? Because they will be killing every other person around us because we arent healing them, or they know our damage isnt as formidable as real DPS classes. aka getting hit with 2k fireballs, 1.7k shadowbolts, etc.<br />
<br />
I always start in cat form, stealth up, try and 3 shot the priest, if I dont ill shift to bear til the aggro from the enemies switch to weaker targets then its back to cat.<br />
<br />
I still miss the few days I played as moonkin where I literally just cleaned the floor with people. Stay way in the back and drop drop starfires on people lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been doing the same thing and it seems to work awesome. Natural Shapeshifting talent makes this much more feasible as well. Before I had this I could only shift a few times in feral gear, now I can shift a handful of times and have mana left over to heal myself. Man the shadowbolts....some warlock managed to fear me last night a few times while I drooled at the 5 combo points waiting to be used, too bad I never even made it back out of fear after all the dots and shadowbolts &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

and wins.  People are slapping the player on the back and congratsing all over.  Meanwhile, I'm lahmayo thinking they just conned him into using up his DKP and wondering what good that weapon is for a feral druid.<br />
<br />
Can someone explain how this weapon works in feral?  B/C I'm starting to think I'm missing critical information and need schooling.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-24-2006, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, that weapon doesn't appeal to me at all.  Caster, cat or bear.  I see it being better for a shammy with a +int enchant or something like that.</div></div><hr />

has no stats on it.<br />
has a proc effect that does not work in bear form.<br />
<br />
No idea why a feral spec druid would roll on this at all personally. I don't think he was conned, I think the allure of the purple got the better of him/her....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">04-25-2006, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">on top of that, it has completely mediocre dps of 56.5 (only applies to caster/moonkin form)</div></div><hr />

Anyhow, I told him I didn't think that applied in cat form and left it at that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woolybully</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I&quot;m not sure what your end goal is as far as which weapon you want but here's a list of those mentioned weapons in terms of AP.<br />
<br />
Bonecrusher = 92.0 AP<br />
The Unstoppable Force = 85.6 AP (+2% to crit)<br />
Crystal Spiked Maul = 78.4 AP<br />
Doomulus Prime = 72.8 AP (+1% to hit)<br />
Fist of Omokk = 69.6 AP<br />
<br />
For my money the USF is a pretty hard mace to beat in terms of overall value.  High AP, +% to crit, STA and STR.  I'm just about revered so about half way there.  The Bonecrusher would be interesting in Cat form but lacks other stats.  I don't even think I'd bother to enchant it.  I saw mention of people wanting to add +AGI to there weapons which is great in many ways.  It gives +% to crit, + to dodge, add +1 AP for each pt of AGI and works nicely for bear.  But when I get the USF I&quot;m definitely going for a +15 STR enchant.  With Hotw thats +2.4 AP x 15 along with the STR the mace already has.  But then again I'm trying to hit harder with Cat and Bear forms.</div></div><hr />

are you joking?  you want STR for cat, AGI for Bear</div></div><hr />

That depends entirely on what you are trying to do. But for the most part 25 AGI chant is &gt; 15 STR for any form/application.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">05-26-2006, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As people have posted many times before, STR is great up until a certain DPS than AGI begins to have a better effect.<br />
<br />
AGI adds only 1 AP per point but it also adds crit%, armor, and dodge%. I like to keep my AP over 1k and aim for high AGI.<br />
<br />
+25 AGI is so much better than +15 STR. <br />
<br />
15 STR = 30 AP<br />
25 AGI = 25 AP, 1.25% crit, 1.25% dodge, 50 armor (not sure about calcs on dodge/armor, taking the ratios from another post on these forums)<br />
<br />
5 AP versus 1.25% Crit, 1.25% dodge, 50 armor.....hmm seems pretty obvious to me</div></div><hr />
