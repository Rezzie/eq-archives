<br />
When one is healing the MT and gets that debuff do your currently ticking hots continue at the same strength or do they get cut right away?  <br />
<br />
What happens to a running LB stack when you've got the debuff?  I know they &quot;fixed&quot; LB in regards to trinkets, just wondering about this debuff though.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can guess though.<br />
<br />
LB now takes the bonus healing at the time of the most recent refresh.  That means that if you get the debuff in the middle of a Lifebloom cycle and you don't refresh the stack, it should continue to tick for as much as it was ticking for even before you got the debuff ... assuming that you don't refresh it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's like how if you cast a lifebloom in caster form and then switch into ToL form, the added +healing doesn't come into effect until the next cast of LB. at least I think that's how it works haha, game mechanics blah.</div></div><hr />

But at the same time if you get debuff and you have casted rg or rj before the debuff then swiftmend after not so much. It will effect the switmend amount even though it is derived from the hot. That swift mend would have saved a life :(</div></div><hr />
