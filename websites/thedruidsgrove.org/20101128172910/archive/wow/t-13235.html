It wasn't so bad when I just tracked my feral stuff, but now that I'm trying to track resto and moonkin gear as well as feral gear it is out of control.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for an addon that lets me visual organize my gear and that the gear will always stay in certain places as it is moved in/out of the bag via outfitter.  I have such a hard time trying to determine if that blue belt that just dropped is better than my current moonkin belt, because it takes too long to actually find my moonkin belt in my bags.  Let alone actually compare them.  This is made worst due to items being shared among various sets (cat/bear, resto/moonkin).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

So when i want to comapre it with an item out of my current spec, i simply use outfitter to equip the said spec and compare them.<br />
<br />
It's clear in my head right now, i just wish it's easy to understand :)</div></div><hr />

Someone in my guild mentioned ArkInventory.</div></div><hr />

I currently use BaudManifest -It lists inventory in text/icon form in a hierarchical setup (think nested folders like computer file directories) that you can arrange to suit your whims.<br />

Edit: in looking around for a screenshot of it in action, I ran across this article covering BaudManifest, Combuctor, and Baggins.  http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/07/05/the-creamy-gui-center-big-bag-blowout/3</div></div><hr />

I don't know how I survived without it. It has custom rules so, if you were so inclined, you could designate each piece of gear as feral, balance or resto and then AI would group them all together in your bags. Extremely handy. Being able to have all your vendor trash grouped somewhere for easy disposal is nice too. There is a lot you can do with it!</div></div><hr />
