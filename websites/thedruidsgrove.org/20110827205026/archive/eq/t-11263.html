I am a lvl 67 half-elf druid of the Karana variety.  I am sick of being cold/freezing in pants that do not cover my upper thighs and bum.  I would like to have something that is good enough for my level.  Any ideas????</div></div><hr />

Also some 1.5 events drop some good leather pants.</div></div><hr />

I am sure there are more . I am guessing the graphics are all the chain appearance , which looks weird with a leather tunic though.</div></div><hr />

The higher I got in levels, the less graphics that showed up. And yes, the Elysian Leggings were the only legs so far that showed up. I still keep them for &quot;special events&quot; when I don't want to show up naked. I would like to know if the DON mission leather leggings have any graphics, but he won't let me try them on before I buy. It's not really an upgrade, but hey, it might be worth a shot.  Everyone says I'm stupid to look at graphics. but these people haven't had their butt stick to the ice in Velks or Western Wastes either. It would cost me 340 crystals to find out. If I decide to do so, I'll let you know.<br />

I was so happy when i once saw a wood elf druid with nice golden attachments on his leggings as soon as i reached the lvl i made the quest imagin how sad i was when i noticed for a halfling it was the same brown worn leather look like the chaepest buyable leather leggings. The stats were awsome for a nonraiding lvl 30 druid, bu no graphik :mad:</div></div><hr />

Plus my old guildies swore I never wore undies since they couldn't see the thong graphic. *sigh* Oh yeah, why do the female human druids have such wide hips, if I did have the thong graphic... *shudders* I don't even want to think about it. lol:lmao:</div></div><hr />
