<br />
Last month I did all the lower level turn-ins until they disappeared, and now I am going for the thorium widgets, which seemed to give me the best results efficiency wise (I farm herbs, buy thorium, and guild engineer makes the widgets for me).<br />
<br />
I was getting 20 tickets per turn in while the faire was in Mulgore last month.  I am wondering if that is static or if I will get fewer tickets per turn in as my rep with the faire increases during the course of more turn-ins.</div></div><hr />

There are some turn-in quests that go away after you do enough, there are some that are indefinitely repeatable. <br />
<br />
I'm currently farming leather for the rugged leather kits turn-in.<br />
<br />
8 kits per 20 tickets<br />
I need 1200 tickets<br />
1200 / 20 = 60 turn-ins<br />
60 * 8 = 480 kits <br />
480 * 5 = 2400 pieces of rugged leather.  <br />
<br />
I'm just about 1/2 way there with a few weeks to go.  I should be good :)<br />
<br />
*edit:  http://www.goblinworkshop.com/darkmoon-faire.html has a good breakdown on all the Darkfaire quests</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to your question, you get the same tickets all the way through. Here is a great Darkmoon Faire guide:<br />

<br />
And glad to see we're posting the same info at the same time! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad there are no diminishing returns on the tickets.  I'm up to about 220 widgets in storage now (including bank alt), I figure another 80 ought to do it.<br />
<br />
6 widgets per turn-in for 20 tickets<br />
1000 tickets requires 50 turn-ins<br />
50 turn-ins requires 300 widgets<br />
<br />
each widget requires 3 thorium bars and 1 rune cloth<br />
I can get 60 thorium bars and 20 runecloth for 13g on my server<br />
20 widgets = 13g<br />
300 widgets = 195g<br />
<br />
I'm making 30-40g a day herb farming, so it should only take me a few more days.</div></div><hr />
