We have levelled together all the way ( am 50 now ). We always ding within a few fights of each other.<br />
<br />
When we were young we helped each other out with class quests. Well now he is getting level 52 class quests and I do not have any. In fact, I noticed from Allaz that EVERY SINGLE CLASS but druids have higher level class quests.<br />
<br />
Did a search in the forums here and didn't have any luck finding a discussion. Has there ever been one? Whats is up with that?</div></div><hr />

Mages have a class quest around 50 (I think it was added in one of the recent patches).  The alliance version starts in IronForge and eventually sends you to Azshara. If you are helping do the mage quest, do the Arcane Runes quest at the same time.</div></div><hr />
