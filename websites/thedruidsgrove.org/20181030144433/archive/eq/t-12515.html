Got to VZ in p4 last night, and he was like on steroids. All that time off, guess he had nothing better to do than hang out at the gym.</div></div><hr />

Time was fuxxord. You couldn't progress past p1. This patch fixed that issue. The other mobs seemed the same, but VZ just tore us a new browneye x4.</div></div><hr />

Something to do with making aggro even harder than it was before, but I wasn't paying close enough attention to remember the specifics. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">11-04-2005, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Specifically, VZ is now chain-stunning, according to the tanks in my TS.  By the time a tank can reestablish aggro, VZ has already ripped through a bunch of healers.  Then he starts the stun fun again...you get the picture.<br />
<br />
And on our first engagement, we had him in the corner by the bookcase where we pull down TZ, and his adds spawned right on top of him.  2nd engagement, we tried tanking him in the opposite corner, and the stupid adds popped on his spawn spot.<br />
<br />
Ah, well, I always enjoyed P3.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I hope they don't mess with TZ he is hard enough with all the other spawn's you have to do before he spawns.</div></div><hr />

He was pretty much the same to us, attacked us and he died as usual.  However, will make note of what u all have posted in case we have problems, we hit up TIME every Thursday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">11-08-2005, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we hit Time again last night and had no problems. This might have just been an instance problem like being stuck in p1. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">11-08-2005, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been doing potime runs post-normal raids for fun and clickies for a while.  Basically adopted a semi-large guild that couldn't seem to progress on it's own and got them flagged to fill out our numbers so we could finish under the time limits.  Most of the players suck, but they try their best and the guild people that come usually make up for the mistakes.  We've always had a bit of trouble on VZ (and how they hell they pull him during TZ all the time is beyond me &gt;&lt;) but we haven't seen anything like a dps boost on him.</div></div><hr />

Ah, I have fond memories of the line of death.</div></div><hr />

Something else that's fun to add... if your raid stops short on phase 4, it's always fun to play tag with VZ after most everyone is gone!  Just cast on him and run till he FD's ya =P (and don't stand up till you're off HoTT &gt;&lt;).</div></div><hr />
