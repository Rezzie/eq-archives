<br />
I want to create a Paladin alt, and I was wondering if there's a comparable site/forum for Pallys?  I did a Google search and found some sites for basic info, but nothing like TDG.<br />
<br />
The sticky threads in the official WoW Paladin forum are good, but that's about it. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

<br />
but if you have questions regarding paladins, i can answer them for you, the last character i leveled to 60 before i started my druid was a paladin...<br />
<br />
and you already read the stickies on the wow paladin forums and to tell you the truth, they have lots of useful information in those threads... i usually ended using allakhazam for my paladin questions...<br />
<br />
but if you have any specific questions, throw them my way and i'll do the best to answer them from my own personal experience.</div></div><hr />
