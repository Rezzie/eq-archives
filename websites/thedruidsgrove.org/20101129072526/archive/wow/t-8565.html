I'm hearthed in southshore, soloing in Desolace and Stranglethorn.  Starting to group with pals and guildies in the easier instances.  Getting killed by horde is an increasing reality for me. To a lesser degree I need to decide when and where to kill horde players.<br />
<br />
So how do I behave?  I dont want to kill lower levels and I dont want lower levels to group up and attack me or a pair of of lower levels to take me down while im fighting a mob. Now dont get me wrong: I know that what I want is only very distantly related to the reality of pvp. <br />
<br />
But how do I convey that through my behavior.  Do you horde guys treat everyone with equal animosity or do you treat your enemies with an attitude that reflects their behavior toward you.<br />
<br />
I want to be a good representative of my side, ready to fight but not kill dishonorably, defend myself and other low level players without going down the ganking roadl<br />
<br />
Are there ways for me to behave that will help to communicate my ethics to my enemies?</div></div><hr />

When i am 60 i'll be ganking any red alliance, i don't care if they are level 10. i was killed over 20 times in one night in hillsbrad by alliance, most of them rogues and priests, all of them over 50. <br />
<br />
Maybe i'm not man enough to just take it and not do it when i'm higher, but i'll be damned if i'm not going to return the favor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main druid is on cenarian circle but I get killed alot by alliance on firetree with other chars. I not uncommon at all to be hit in the back by a rogue or mage with a grinning skull for a level. Sure it pisses me off but killing newbs when I'm 60 doesn't hurt the people who did it to me when I was leveling just pisses other people like me off. Having said that if people with Ham's attitude had a &quot;I wanna be a ganker when I grow up&quot; flag on their head, I'd kill them everytime and probably go ahead and camp the corpse for awhile.<br />
<br />
My rule is of thumb is basically if I think that the player or group of players could be a potential threat I kill them. If not I'll pass on by. This usually means a single player within 3 or 4 levels, add more level difference for groups or if your likely to be fighting tough mobs while they are in the area. <br />
<br />
This applies only to lower than me. Anyone higher level I will attempt to kill if I think I have any chance at all whether they are fighting a mob or not. I will usually tackle anybody that is not a skull to me, but then again I die alot.</div></div><hr />

Kill or Be Killed!!!!<br />

Basically as a 60 Priest, alliance has gotten the strange Idea that Im an easy kill. If I catch a grp of two more I usually attack to garantee an edge or atleast take 1 or 2 down with me.<br />

My rogue is 56, I'm trying to get him to 60 before points go into place, cause afterwards, it's gonna be hell.<br />
<br />
Heh, however be smart about it, if you intend to continue operating in that area exp/quest whatever. Don't attack first, you can't really operate with constant PvP.<br />
<br />
Was doing that escort quest in Felwood one time. Some Warlock attacks my rogue, so I kill him. He comes back with 2 friends just as I'm about to finish the escort and kills me and my rogue. Then they start trying to do the escort themselves.... Heh, they shoulda just let me finish. I spent the next 2 hours ambushing them (double stealth for the win). They finally logged off (walking over their corpses made me smile) and I finished the escort myself. If you'r gonna PvP, unless you're massively superior to your opponent, don't stay in the area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deze</div><div class="date">04-01-2005, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well when the Honour system comes in there will be good reason to pvp so imo it's a good idea to get some practice in before hand. Whether you are lvl 60 or not someone who has been pvp'ing all through the game is going to have a big advantage over someone who hasn't. Experience counts for a lot. And your level isn't going to matter that much since honourable kills are going to be against those that are no more than a few levels lower than you and above. So I don't really see how being at a higher level is going to make that much difference.<br />
As I say I personally think experience is the most important factor for pvp (personal xp, not in game xp ;P) and higher level does not mean better at pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roughcoat</div><div class="date">04-04-2005, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses.  Deze I had your advice firmly in mind this weekend:  I tried to integrate your suggestion that we &quot;practice&quot; pvp with Leafweirs point about being &quot;smart&quot; about it.  <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
as I ran up  the road from BB with another druid we came upon several fracases and then my party was attacked a couple of times.  Now i do tend to hesitate with this stuff sometimes.  I'm not yet a particularly skillful druid by anyone's standard so I don't want to draw horde aggro unless its for good reason and with good result.  But the advice I got here &quot;liberated&quot; me.  After all, I  hadn't started it, and so I could feel free to help.  All the horde involved were near my level.  I even survived my worst case most embarrassing scenario ie being feared by a slightly lower level (who does this?) Shaman?<br />
<br />
I felt like I got better each time I tried it.<br />

The other day i was farming leathers and really didnt wanna be disturbed. A group of 5-7 alliance started to gather, all about 5-10lvls lower than me. Numerous times i would see one or two of them medding up with VERY little life left... one or two moonfire kills, but they left me alone, so i left them alone. Other times i will just do something really sadistic like rooting a alliance player running away from many mobs lol. There has been a few times ive seen a warrior or rogue running away from 5+ mobs, i root and watch as the mobs rape him, its all in good fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boudicca</div><div class="date">04-04-2005, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It also depends a lot on the server's mentality.  Before my guild transferred, we were on Stormreaver, which was a very RED=DEAD, no mercy kind of server.  Pretty cutthroat and PvP-intensive regardless of level.  We moved to Stormscale, a smaller community that was so cordial when it came to PvP, opposing factions could come to the front gates of Ironforge and Orgrimmar and get 1v1 duel scenarios without getting attacked by other players.  Many times Alliance players pass me now and just /wave and go about their business - something that NEVER happened on Stormreaver.  I think I surprised many when I didn't /wave back and charged in with bear form.   :lmao: <br />
<br />
It was culture shock, to say the least.  Thankfully, I think we've (the server transfers) injected some more tenacity into our new server so there is less carebearing and more real pvp, but we've also had to mellow out a bit with our ruthlessness to adjust a bit to the new server customs.<br />
<br />
Take a survey on what your server's community is like, and that can help you see what kind of playstyle you should develop for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hertzsae</div><div class="date">04-05-2005, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm on a PvE (carebear) server.  I often wish my friends had chosen PvP, so I try to mess with the Horde when I have a chance.  When I was about lvl 50 I was running through an area south of Ratchet and saw some low lvl horde doing an escort quest.  I was very tempted to kill the escortee, knowing how painful those quests are and they are the opposing faction.  However, one of them saluted me and must have told the rest to do the same.  They did and I left them alone.  I was a little supprised that I did that.  But if they show me respect like that, I just wouldn't feel right about killing them.<br />
<br />
So I guess the point of all this is that maybe try saluting, waving, or bowing to the opposing faction if you don't want to fight.  If they have a strong sense of honor, they'll probably leave you allone.</div></div><hr />

That really doesnt bother me as i tend to go about my own business anyway... I'll defend any NE or guild member(i play the NE who think NE are superior to all other races hehe) and i'll laugh hard(/gloat) whenever I see a horde in trouble, but i seldom chase them around the world...<br />
<br />
That said I've been joining raidgroups since i was lvl 13(now 44), and when in Raid mode no one left alone... Even the low lvl chars who hide behind the high lvled ones and only hit you when you have 1/20 health left are dealt with.. If u are stupid enough to get involved even if ur half my lvl, then expect to get killed... i can hold my own in those settings, and the more caos the better I seem to manage.. I can go from healing party members to takin on several guards at a time to stealthing Horde players.... I seldom die although i'm usually right in the middle of the action...<br />
<br />
Sadly my 1 on 1 abilities are of a different standard... I really havent duelled that much, but when I do the outcome  varries very... I can kill players 5 lvls above me and the next duel i'll loose to someone several lvls below me... But my mentality is I never back down from a challenge.....<br />
<br />
Conclusion: I need to work on my 1 on 1 skills.....</div></div><hr />

Not &quot;Whisper&quot; or &quot;channels&quot; those unrealsitic metacommunication necessary for a mmorph.<br />

But just simply in /say and /yell.  It would add so much life to the game to be able to &quot;Taunt&quot;, &quot;Threaten&quot;, &quot;Warn&quot;, even &quot;Beg for leaving alone.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Still, I think though that people on the opposite faction sometimes do remember us.  I know that whilst the horde druids treat me with relative equanimity in &quot;private circumstanses such as hunting mobs once war breaks out we are for all intents and purposes dire enemies.</div></div><hr />

But then again, Tauren is the &quot;nicest&quot; race in the horde alliance, and they don't even want undead in their alliance either :D COME OVER TO OUR SIDE, FELLOW COWS!<br />

<br />
My general policy is to gank all rogues/shamans I see, whatever the level, and leave anyone else if they aren't 60 (this is when I'm not in PvP mode, where red = dead).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">katahn</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I consider it low behavior to go after someone on a field of battle who is recently revived and &quot;grey&quot;.  Whether I'm said &quot;grey&quot; or they are, it doesn't really matter to me.  If they're grey, red name or not, unless they are attacking me, an Alliance PC, or Alliance NPC, I leave them alone.  Also, being on an RP server, I strongly disdain the practice of &quot;attacking from blue&quot; on the principle that if you're going to PvP you should flag first rather than get an &quot;automatic 'suprise' hit&quot; from the immunity of blue-name status.<br />
<br />
I regard those who gank as beneath contempt.  Corpse-camping, chain-killing quest-giving NPCs who are grey and/or non-aggressive, or otherwise using the PvP system and environment not to immerse yourself in a virtual world on the brink of all-out-war but purely to &quot;win&quot;, to &quot;pwn them&quot;, to make it &quot;player vs. player&quot; and not &quot;character vs. character.&quot;  Those who are bad sports about winning or losing are the next step up, slightly better than gankers/griefers, but in my estimation no differant than the guy or gal who is a bad sport about winning or losing Monopoly(tm).<br />
<br />
Will this get me killed?  Probably.  Will giving a recently rezzed &quot;redname&quot; a chance to retreat or med-up and come after me again bite me in the rear?  Most likely.  Does it make a differance?  No.  In the end I think people need to realize that not everyone plays the game with the same level of intensity PvE, PvP, RP, or what-have-you.  Forebearance and taking the high road should be exalted and praised, not body counts and butchering those too weak to put up an effective resistance.<br />
<br />
If I see an enemy player in a friendly zone that isn't &quot;grey or skull&quot; I'll /pvp on and make it clear I am challenging them.  If they are already PvP+ I'll enable and then engage from my best possible advantage.  Again, only if not &quot;grey or skull&quot;.  I avoid monsters that are &quot;skull cons&quot; and I don't bother with &quot;grey-con&quot; mobs that don't attack me first.  Why should I treat an enemy character differantly?  Because I want &quot;to win&quot;?  Bleh to that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Templar84</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently switched from an RP server to a PvP server (Darkspear). I play on the horde (26 Tauren Druid) and I've never been ganked by more than one person at a time, but ?? do it repeatedly. I find the worst gankers to be Night Elves and Humans, though I agree with an above poster that Undead are a pain in the ass, though I obviously have never been ganked by one, when I group with them I find them to be obnoxious and childish MUCH more frequently than members of other races. I 've had one ?? gnome wave and pass me by and another sic his sucubus and a mechanical dragon on me, as i logged in, so I was at half health before my loading screen had gone down. <br />
<br />
Whenever this happens I swear to myself I'm going to be as ruthless as possible with any Alliance I run across, but as a matter of fact I don't. At my lvl I don't run into people lower than me very often. I was in Ashenvale at a strange time (I'm in Australia) so it was completely deserted and I ran into an 18 NE rogue. I resisted the urge to kill him, and even though I waved he took off running like a bat out of hell. Poor kid was so addled, even though he was trying to get away from me  he wouldn't deviate from the road, so I kept gaining on him by running in straight lines rather than the twisting turning path. I wasn't chasing him, I just happened to be travelling in that direction (Splintertree to Zoram Strand). <br />
<br />
I've talked with guys who play at my local net cafe who play Horde and Alliance on different servers and they say the Alliance is worse gankers/griefers and seem to be younger kids. I tried to figure out what makes a younger player more likely to do this than an older player and the only thing I can think of is because older players are more likely to be paying for their own account, they appreciate that by wasting someone else's time you are wasting their money (Monthly subscription) which is ALMOST like stealing. Furthermore corpse camping or ganking newbies or lowbies is also a waste of the person who's doing it time, so older players realize this more. I think of younger kids who gank and grief for easy kills, as sort of like those who play games with all the invincibility codes in, its fun for a little while, but gets boring and unchallenging. <br />
<br />
I think a good suggestion if Blizzard is unwilling to implement dishonor, is to at least have a reputation visible by players on the other team, so you can tell if the person you're fighting is a ganker or griefer or a good guy. That way people on both teams could viciously target gankers while having a measure of respect for a person on the other team with a good rep. It wouldn't provide any punishment in game, but would allow players to police the world (lol) themselves, or not, as they choose.</div></div><hr />
