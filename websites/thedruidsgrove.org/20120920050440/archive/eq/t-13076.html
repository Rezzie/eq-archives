<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Negian</div><div class="date">01-10-2006, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So anyone else having a problem with Replenshment cure since last patch?  It seems to me from what I have encountered that if there is a zone wide AE in your buff bar before the AE your trying to cure it don't work... let me explain how I came to this conclusion.<br />
<br />
The other day we did Bloodeye, we beat this encounter a few times already however last run we wiped cause we couldn't cure the AE fast enough. I have noticed that I had the zone wide AE in my first slot so then I couldn't cure the AE DT with RC6 on both me and my cleric in the same grp, even cleric 1.5 epic didn't cure anymore.<br />
<br />
So on Saturday morning I go help out on a Puqua run just for the heck of it cause I haven't been in that zone forever. Same thing I have the zone wide AE and I can't cure Tash with RC6??? Anyone else had problems with this? Hopefully they fix this soon cause it's annoying.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-10-2006, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experiance, what happens is this.<br />
<br />
I will use Uqua as my example<br />
<br />
Say you have Aura of Destruction in your first slot.<br />
In some slot under that, you have tash.<br />
<br />
Aura of Destruction has the following counters:<br />
&lt;table class=&quot;spellview&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; width=&quot;95%&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;spelllabel&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;10: &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;Increase Poison Counter by 99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;spelllabel&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;11: &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;Increase Poison Counter by 99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;     &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;spelllabel&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;12: &lt;/td&gt;     &lt;td&gt;Increase Poison Counter by 99&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
Resplendant Cure applies all 25 poison counters to Aura of Destruction.<br />
<br />
Since this is not enough to cure Aura of Destruction, no remaining counters carry over to try and cure Tash.<br />
<br />
What I typically do to avoid this, is load a instaclick in my initnal slot.<br />
<br />
Once you zone in, and the zone wide AE goes off it should be in your last slot.<br />
<br />
Click off the Instaclick buff, so tash will always land in the top of the buff bar, and thus curable without having to cure Aura of Destruction.<br />
<br />
Its been awhile since I have done Bloodeye, but it is likely a similar issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eiram</div><div class="date">01-10-2006, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess Feniers example is right, I discoverd the same, when tash was unter Aura of Destruction it was impossible to cure tash, if it was just in front there was no problem.<br />
 <br />
I don't think there should be anything changed in that behavior, Buf and in this case debuffmanegement is one thing we have to learn to deal with.</div></div><hr />

This has been an issue for as long as I have been able to access Uqua, nearly 2 years now iirc.<br />

Confirmed. This was an issue since Uqua. Used to bufflock myself all but the bottom one so I could put AoD at the bottom and not have to look at Tash icons all night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best Method:<br />
<br />
Have a Cleric Chain Cast Antidote on you to remove Aura.  Instaclick<br />
Aura hits again later on down the list - drop insta click.<br />
<br />
Antidote will cure Aura in drastically less amounts of casting then Pure Blood.<br />

when I was firsted introduced to uqua, this was suggested by the more experienced players.  We tried to be completely buffed before zoning in. <br />
<br />
try to keep the aura of destruction as far down on the list as possible throughout your time in uqua.  so if you die, get it cured and fill up your buff slots before it sets in again.</div></div><hr />

Just make sure you get buffed during this time, and hold an instantclicky ready for the first buffslot when rezzeffect fades.</div></div><hr />
