<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-04-2010, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I took almost a two month hiatus from the wonderful world of WoW...I should have stopped in to keep in touch...but I'm a horrible slacker and had a lot going on.<br />
<br />
My husband decided to walk away from our marriage, but before anyone gets worried or asks...Yes, my cub and I are doing absolutely fine - in fact, doing much better than we were before.  Seems like everyone's happier all the way around.  <br />
<br />
So, that being said...I just came back to WoW and I'm trying to get back into being a good little druid.  Khel and Skwid convinced me to go horde, but I didn't want to move my druid (mainly because I'm working on her mount achievement and I'm at 91/100 and I REALLY like her Alliance Only mounts...) so I'm leveling a new Tauren druid.  <br />
<br />
Glad to be back though and I missed you guys!  Oh, and yes, my return marks the rebirth of my blog...well it will when I have time to really put in some work on updates. =D<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from y'all soon!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is sunshine behind every cloud.  It's just a matter of moving the clouds out of the way. =3<br />
<br />
Missed you guys.  Do you have links for the new location yet or a tentative move date?</div></div><hr />

The most likely date is next weekend (not this weekend).</div></div><hr />

Back in WoW just in time for Cataclysm, it seems. :-)</div></div><hr />

Have been slammed at work and by the time I get a moment to write there...my mind is so completely frazzled I can't even think of what to say. <br />
<br />
So I'm both very excited and very much dreading the talent tree changes.  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />
