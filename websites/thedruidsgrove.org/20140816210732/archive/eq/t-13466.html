I'd solo at Gunthak, but the experience bonus has REALLY stopped coming to the point of where I'd do better sitting there.  Any other place that's well populated and has a good experience bonus for a level 44?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">03-08-2006, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Three quick suggestions I have for you:<br />
<br />
1)  Root / dotting: To to Gunthak and run through - zone into Dulak Harboar!  Can snare / root / dot the mobs near zone line for safety.  If you feel adventurous, can look for higher level mobs on the boats.  I did this from low to mid 40's.<br />
<br />
2)  Root / dotting, or quadding after 46:  Port to CS (Cobalt Scar) and root / dot &quot;a wyvern.&quot;  They range in level from 38-42.  Just watch for the named &quot;Yvolcarn&quot; (icky faction hit) and the drakes (casters).  Once you get to level 46, get your get your NEW QUADDING spell &quot;Lightning Blast.&quot;  Then grab your very first KEI and attempt to quad the Wyverns.  I did this through lower 50's I think (the hides used to sell well in bazaar not to mention gem drops).  I forget at what level the mobs start to con Light blue, but when you kill 4 at a time instead of one, exp is slightly better.<br />
<br />
3) Charming / fear kiting:  If you like to charm / fear kite, then Jaggedpine Forrest is for you!  Port to Surefall glades and use map to find zone in to JPF (when you find a glowing red ball, click on it).  Things to note:<br />
<br />
a giant anaconda is flagged as animal and can be fear kited quite easily (snare, fear, dot)<br />
<br />
Or better yet - charm one of those animals with wings!  Find a timber griffawn (34-38) or a timber griffon (40-45) - Snare one, charm it, then pull a snake or giffawn (snare, fear, and let pet beat on it).<br />
<br />
I did the JPF charm / fear kiting thing for a level in my lower 50's.  Wish I knew about this zone much earlier.<br />
<br />
NOTE for JPF: Don't agro cats, they give icky faction hits for the local merchants there.  Oh ya, did I mention there is a bank in the zone?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madex</div><div class="date">03-08-2006, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If memory serves do the dwarfs in BB till 45. Then go quad the Sprioc's in TD till I believe 49ish. Then go on out and Quad some Raptors in TD as well. This zone should be pretty empty with all the new content. 50's start doing PoN root rotting the yard trash. Another route is the guards in Katta. As a druid you have alot of viable options to do. or as bulk suggests do the Wyverns in CS till like 55 or so and then quad the otters. Good Luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">03-08-2006, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 44 I leveled in Echo Cavern, southern part. Most mobs are far away from one another and can be single pulled. There are 3 camps, one has 4 beetles, one has 7 stone men/ fiends (the outer room of the taskmaster), and the last one which is close to the deep zone has 2 singles (one is a wanderer, also 7 other mobs here but they are too close to one another). Sometimes a named would pop and I just pulled it to the guard/dwarves so that they kill it for me. I also tried to let the single femail guard wore it down and I took over to kill it, which worked (be aware the named could not be snared).<br />
 <br />
I used enveloping roots (fixed 1 min duration), then applied 3 magic based dots and ensnare. After the root expired, the mob was at half hp and I would fight it straight melee with my Damage Shield on. This would kill it quickly, then I heal myself rinse and repeat. <br />
 <br />
At level 45 I could use the elder spirit's arm and hand pieces to get a free dot + free snare. I timed it right so that I could handle two mobs at a time (root dot one, then root dot another, just be able to come back for meleeing the first). Almost no down time at 45.<br />
 <br />
Level 46 --- as a previous post stated, TD spiroc is the best exp. However recently there are shaman type mobs there, high level and cannot be snared. My level 65 dru had to exodus on one of them. So be careful not to agro these.</div></div><hr />
