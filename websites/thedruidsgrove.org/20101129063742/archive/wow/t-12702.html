<br />
While I had a blast in AV and consistently came top 5 for healing dished out (a rough marker of success I know) things were a bit chaotic and I'm interested in how other people approach BG, specifically AV at the moment, healing.<br />
<br />
I'm going to wait on BGs outside of AV until I hit 70 after last night's experience but I'm interested in any general hints and tips for there too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing in AV is the fastest and most efficient way to make lots of honor.<br />
<br />
1.  I use an addon called Healing Range Alpha which turns your CTRA bars (or whatever type of bars you use) slightly transparent when people are out of range.<br />
That way you can always see at a glance who you are in range to heal.  This makes healing in a battleground very easy.<br />
<br />
2.  I also press Shift-V, which requires no addons, and shows nearby friendly health bars.  Injured people often come to stand next to you, so that lets you see anyone within 25 yards or so that needs a quick top up.<br />
<br />
3.  I also look for tough-looking warriors at the start of the battle, and I whisper them to let them know I will be following them to heal them and to please try to stay in range and protect me whenever possible.<br />
This works wonders and with your help a well-geared warrior can dominate the battlefield, and you are right behind him soaking up all the honor kills.  :&gt;<br />

Doh!  Cant see the wood for the trees (bad pun, sorry).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
I did enjoy keeping a hunter and his pet up while he laid waste to several horde all dutifully ignoring the tree next to them slapping heals down on their target.<br />
<br />
I could get to really enjoy this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honor isn't actually from healing, per se, the way it works is you get honor for winning (or losing) the battleground, and you get honor every time a nearby enemy is killed.  So if you follow around a nails warrior healing him, and he kills a lot of people, that translates into a lot of honor for you.  :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">06-27-2008, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nellie, to reference another thread of yours, Healbot really shines in BG's. HB has four default skins, including one called Alterac Valley.  With the AV skin the only players that will be visible to you in the HB interface are the one's that are in range of your heals and buffs, otherwise they are completely transparent.<br />
<br />
There is almost never a reason to try and maintain an LB stack in a BG, so you can just throw heals and buffs on everyone that pops up on your interface.  It's fun to crush the healing meters in a BG, roll up some huge HK numbers, and get whispered thank yous for heals most people don't expect to come.<br />
<br />
Since LB is non-directional, you don't even have to see the player you're healing as long as there are no LOS issues, which is amazing for taking or defending flags in AB and EotS. ;-)<br />
<br />

Not a huge issue I guess though...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
When I'm healing on my druid in BG's, I cycle through all nearby friendly players by holding down Ctrl and hitting tab.  I have 1 set to LB, 2 to rejuv 3 to swiftmend and 4 to regrowth.  So as I'm cycling through ppl I'll throw up a LB and Rejuv on them, then keep cycling through.  Also, as  Annik said, having friendly players health bars showing helps too (on this note, a resto druid that I play arenas with has a mouseover lifebloom macro that lets him cast lifebloom on whoever his mouse is pointing at, without clicking them.  Pretty helpful).<br />
 <br />
After everyone is topped off, i start tabbing through the hostile targets with ctrl 1 as roots, ctrl 2 cyclone ctrl 3 to FF and ctrl 4 as wrath.  I find it helpful to have target of target active, so that when I'm working on CC'ing things, if I see that their target is taking a lot of dmg I know to heal them asap.</div></div><hr />

Sweet, did not know you could do that :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">07-02-2008, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ctrl + tab is nice cause it only targets ppl that are close to you, and I seem to recall that in a future patch they are making it so that it doesn't target yourself.  Sometimes it won't let you target friendlies behind you, which is a weird bug.<br />
 <br />
Edit:  You can hit Ctrl + Shift + Tab to cycle backwards through close friendly targets, or Shift + tab to cycle backwards through hostile targets<br />
 <br />
Also, the addon Bongos2 is really helpful because it turns your spell icons red when your target is out of range. Helps to maintain max range.</div></div><hr />
