Then, you need to find an alchemist to transmute them into a single arcanite bar.<br />
<br />
The reason for the price is simple.  Arcane crystals can only be mined from Rich Thorium veins.  Thus, you need 300 mining, plus the luck of it being mined from the vein.  Arcane crystals go for about 25g+ on our server.  <br />
<br />
Arcanite transmute costs about 5g (due to the shared cooldown on transmutes) on our server.  Depending on the market prices of arcane crystals, the bars will be anywhere from 30g and up.</div></div><hr />

The crystals sell on my server for between 24-28g.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the alchemy or mining you need to buy the crystal, say 25g and a thorium bar, not expensive, then pay an alchemist to transmute it.  The transmute has a 48 hour cooldown, and blocks all other transmutes for those 2 days, so alchemists want about 4g to use their cooldown for you, then list the bar on the AH, you're probably at 30g invested by now.  If you can make about 5g profit you're doing pretty well.<br />
<br />
As an alchemist I make my own every 2 days and get to profit from not paying for a transmute, so I can make about 8g profit pretty reliably.</div></div><hr />

Acctually. I got a Arcane Crystal from the small thorium vein at felwood flightpoint once in the Beta. Maybe it was a bug? &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
