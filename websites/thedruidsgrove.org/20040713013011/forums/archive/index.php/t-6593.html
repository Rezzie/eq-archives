<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">02-08-2004, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Coray has posted his last Mobhunter article (http://www.mobhunter.com), a Q&amp;A interview with SOE where he both poses the questions and answers them!  And in the same article he announced his retirement from Mobhunter.<br />
<br />
Unlike his predecessor he isn't going to go to work for SOE, but he has decided to move on from Everquest.<br />
<br />
Coray's articles were generally refreshingly direct in their criticism, and sometimes praise, of SOE's game decisions.  Those of us who enjoyed his witty articles will miss them.</div></div><hr />
