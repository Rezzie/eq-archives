We've cleared up to prince the previous week, and we can clear up to curator with minimal problems. <br />

I'm sitting there tanking Midnight, everything is going well. He's about half health and I see my Faerie Fire is about to tick off. Now I don't have a fancy macro or it set up on the normal action bar, I have both of them set up on the right side of the screen for easy clicking as I don't use them all too often. I go to click it and I hit the normal faerie fire instead of the feral one.<br />

I pop out into caster form and that horse hits me in places I'd rather not mention. Thank god our healers and warrior step up and finish him off quick and then down Attumen. I get my badge and my tail between my legs, vowing never to do that again ; )<br />

I never have the tank targeted on fights, and always replied on clicking the spell and clicking who it goes to. Back in the day, I've innervated the tank the few rare occations I had him targeted.<br />
<br />
These days, never more. Right click == self. Being Resto, I get no griefs for keeping Innervate to myself. ;)</div></div><hr />

They only get back 2k mana whereas a t4 druid and priest will get back 8kmana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i suspect nevetheless they did wonder why the tank suddenly decided to shift out to caster form in the middle of the fight<br />

I haven't actually done that screw up in a while, haha. <br />
<br />
And about faerie fire/feral faerie fire, what I did was combine the two into 1 button using a macro.  Basically when I'm in caster form it'll cast the caster form one, when I'm in cat/bear it'll cast the feral version.  Works lovely, one of the few macros I've come to love (also use similar macros for prowl/shadowmend, then ones for ravage/shred and pounce/cower based on whether I'm stealthed or not).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last week my guild wanted a speedrun SSC in one night (yes we are normaly not that fast :-( )<br />
and it all worked great.<br />
Killed Hydross, Lurker, Leo, Karathress and then got to Tidewalker. Time was short cause we need 2-3 tries on Vashj to down her. So Tide has to fall on first try.<br />
Everything works great and there comes the last murloc-groups.<br />
I watch my parties hp-bars and think...hmmm lets Tranq.<br />
Skilled 1 day before to a pvp built and dont have the aggro-reduce on Tranq skilled.<br />
So the murlocs think &quot;Let's chop some wood&quot;....all ranged were next :grin: <br />
<br />
Raid wiped, vashj wasnt downed cause ppl had to go ....<br />
And poor druidserg was slapped by the raid-leaders :nono: <br />
<br />
S h i t happens!</div></div><hr />
