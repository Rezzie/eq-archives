I have 2 other accounts that I can group with my druid in order to meet the min of 3.  Now that the creator mission repops, are there any DoN missions that are soloable?<br />
 <br />
Also, looking for a new place to kite, charm, or root/dot with my druid (I like to solo with him more than I like to group) in either DoN or DoDH.  Many threads talk about missions in the Nest (instanced versions) where the mobs have lower resists than the normal versions and great xp.  I have also seen writeups on soloing some of the spell missions in DoDH but am doubtful a 65 druid could do them.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, your suggestions are most appreciated.</div></div><hr />

(That's the only Nest mission I am somewhat familiar with). As for any other besides Creator, I am sure there are a few, but the Nest and Creator ones are the only two I have done. And by solo, I mean getting the mission with help from afk friends, obviously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Creator can be hard for you since it provides little to no kiting room, so you have to carefully clear the mobs at zone in first so you have some room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">01-24-2006, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't recommend the nest at level 65.  I wouldn't recommend for a druid of any level / aa / gear level to try to solo lair of the black wing, unless you don't mind little awards from a few hours of work.<br />
 <br />
The first DoN task I solo`d was the tier 2 (evil) one group task in the ascent, i forget the name.  But you basically needed to kill 1 kirian and the named.  You'ld usually need to kill about 6 mobs total cause of mobs in your way + wanderers etc.  However, the ascent has terrible warping and 1 warp would likely get you killed.  <br />
 <br />
If you wanna grind DoN crystals I'ld recommend making your own groups (even a 4 kiter kite group so you get 3x the crystals.)  The odds of you getting invited to a good DoN group at 65 and nil to nada, but if you got /anon you may be able to trick a few people into joining =D I'ld just go to the instance and /invite, /taskadd them form there ;p.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking more for whatever could be done the fastest with 2-3 characters to get the faction tokens.  Crystals are a bonus but not as important really to me at this point.  I have access to: 70 bard, sk, druid, cleric, shm, berserker...I can reasonably play 2 or 3 of them at a time.<br />
<br />
How hard is web of lies to solo?<br />
How are other nest missions?<br />
What mission(s) do you think could be done the fastest?</div></div><hr />

You can invis through a lot and have to probably kill like 15 mobs total. Then again, you might get a really bad set of see-invis stuff and have to clear the regular .. like what, 40 mobs? It's not that much. Higher concentration of drakes is bonus because of possible metallic drake scale / glossy drake hide drops.</div></div><hr />

Yea but you need to clear up to them. It's really easy though.</div></div><hr />

Use harmony and single pulls are a snap. Small kiting room, don't remember if they summon or not, but I duo this with a BL friend of mine all the time and have a boxed char 66 ench or 62 rog around for the loot and some added dmg, but mainly just XP sponge. BL is roughly 9-9.5kHP unbuffed. All mobs are slowed and tanked when we do this. Take you, your shaman, and either SK or Zerker and you should do fine.  Oh and debuff them on incomming with Annul Magic.  Hasted  mobs aren't mana efficient unless you are controling them. ;)</div></div><hr />
