<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fredrick</div><div class="date">10-12-2006, 05:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok... This may sound a bit lame but my account is currently inactive so I can't post on the WOW forums.  My request is that someone repost what I say here in the WOW Druid forum in the hopes that the devs will consider it, you dont have to use my words or credit me in any way I just think this should be posted for the devs to consider before BC release.<br />
<br />
First of all the new talent update is brillant, It would have been unreasonable to ask for much more, and I'm very impressed by the dev's ability to work with and respond to the ideas people have posted in the Druid forum.  I do however have two complaints; <br />
(1) Natural Perfection (great talent btw) seems like a tallent that would function very well in synergy with moonkin (possibly in a moonkin/healer raid build), this however is an impossibility due to its placement low in the resto tree.<br />
(2) Improved Tranquility is practicly worthless, it is a tallent that will very unlikely go unused because it's function is so limited and situational that the 2 points would be better spent in virtualy any other talent.<br />
<br />
My proposal would be to do one of the following; either<br />
(1)Buff Improved Tranquility to also reduce the cooldown of tranquility by 1.5/2 minutes per point and swap the postitons of Natural Perfection and Improved Tranquility placing Natural Perfection in the 20 point bracket of the resto tree and Improved Tranquility in the 30 point bracket.<br />
(2)Keep both tallents in their original slots (Natural Perfection in synergy with moonkin arguably making moonkin overpowerd versus melee classes in pvp) and buff Improved Tranquility to shorten the cooldown on tranquility (as above suggested) as well as positively effecting hurricane through agro reruction(25%/50%),cooldown (-20/-40), or damage boost.<br />
<br />
As it currently stands there are strong balance/resto synergy talents deep in the balance tree (Lunar Guidance, Nature's Grace, Moonglow, Balance of Power, and Dream State) but these tallents are all passive, adding little flavor to either tree, in addition there is little deep in the resto tree to benefit balance.  Either one of these changes, especialy the second, would add a nice variety to moonkin and resto builds allowing them to better compliment eachother, and adding broader functionality to moonkin and resto druids in both raid and small group settings. Improved Tranquility has the potential to be a very useful talent, allowing druids with the tallent to carve a useful, though not required, niche for themselves in group play and mass PvP.  <br />
<br />
Well that's that! Tell me what you guys think of my ideas and if yo repost this in the WoW forums please post here saying so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

I dont think Ive ever taken that talent because I never.....ever...use tranquility. Maybe they should leave the cooldown of 5 mins on it but make the 2 talent points make it an instant cast spell that heals for whatever the old channeled amount was. It would be on par with the priests AOE heals but on a longer cooldown....seems fair to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually read a good suggestion about improved tranquility over the weekend.<br />
<br />
The idea is we need a good threat reducer like feint or fade or some other skills other classes have.  Well by taking yourself out of combat for 10 seconds to channel a spell that generates zero threat, you sort of give yourself a self-imposed aggro break, hopefully during those 10 seconds the tanks have built there aggro even higher and you are free to resume dps now at a lower relative threat position, and instead of just standing there you significantly benefited your group with some healing.<br />
<br />
I think the only things it would take to make it work is to have improved tranquility talents also give a significant mana cost reduction within 6 seconds of a shift, so that it would be economical for a feral or moonkin to shift to caster, cast barkskin + tranquility, then shift back.  If you got most of the cost of the shift reduced from the tranquility cast, I think it would be real viable.  Also, lowering the position of improved tranquility in the resto tree would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats extremely situational at best. First, tranquility costs almost 1k mana if I remember correctly. Second, if your going to use 1k mana, you better be using it efficiently and not overhealing 4 party members. <br />
<br />
It only can heal party members....what if your healing people that arent in your party?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why the idea of reducing the mana cost would be necessary, so you're really only paying for the shift.<br />
<br />
You're right it wouldn't necessarily get the full benefit unless members of the party are wounded or taking damage, but I have rarely seen when a group of 5 doesn't need some healing in the middle of a boss fight (where threat reduction would be most important).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Tranq all the time when I was feral teamed up with our 4 DPS rogues. The rogues was usually in my proximity anyway as we where all meleeing the mob/boss. This was very popular amongs our rogues and they said it severaly boosted raid DPS as they didnt have to bandage as often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Weird. Our rogues get heals usually lol. With the improved lotp, it would make this talent useless for feral however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ha, imagine tranquility on a 30 minute timer, and restores both health and mana. :] ahh lil fancies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you're missing the point.  The idea isn't the heal is so important, its the aggro-break, a threatless heal is just something to help you continue to contribute rather than sitting there panting for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, suppose they kept the threatless heal as-is, but then added a aggro wiping ability to it, say lowers you're threat by 10% evrey second while channeled.  Would you be interested in that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only problem would be to keep channeling. Remember it is channeled so any attack on you breaks the cast. So if you were being mobed you probably would not be able to reduce your threat enough before getting smacked, thus eliminating your heal and aggro reduction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">10-16-2006, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats why you would cast barkskin first.<br />
<br />
Shift -&gt;barkskin -&gt;tranquility<br />
<br />
It gives you a global cd to deal with, but I like it.</div></div><hr />

I still wouldnt spend the mana to cast it even if after shifting out it lowers it. Shifting costs 500 mana.</div></div><hr />
