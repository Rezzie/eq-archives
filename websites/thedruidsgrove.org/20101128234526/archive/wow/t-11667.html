I hit the AH and bought every piece of &quot;of Nature Protection&quot; gear I could wear.  Most of the items cost anywhere from 3-10g.  The most expensive piece I bought was a 75 stam staff with some feral ap for 15g.  You don't have to worry about any stat besides stam and nature resist.  The only epics in the gear I use are the NR crafted ring and the world dragon quest NR ring, other than that most of the money went to enchanting my newly acquired greens.  The difficult part was getting my def/res up high enough to be uncrittable, but between the Clefthoof bp and legs and Flask of Fort I was able to get to 5.2%.<br />
<br />
Raid-buffed Stats:<br />
23.2k hp<br />
361 NR<br />
5.2% crit reduction<br />
<br />
There was quite a bit of room for improvement in those numbers as well.  I only wish I was a Tauren sometimes... Either way, gearing up for Hydross is expensive for Warriors because of all the epic crafted items they need, but for us NP!  The most expensive piece will be the +20 NR helm enchant and +15 NR cloak enchant.  I farmed a Clefthoof kit for the legs and made an +8 stam kit for my gloves.  Being an enchanter, putting 12 stam on my bracers was free, but if I had +def, I would have used that enchant instead to cap my crit redux.</div></div><hr />

Last night we got him down to 45% and I think we're pretty close now.  I switch between MT on the nature guy and doing offtank duty depending on who shows up.  <br />

This fight significantly favors Tauren tanks, whether they are Warriors or Druids, because that 10% hp gain is simply huge when you are getting hit with the occasional 20k fully unresisted blast.  I wouldn't be surprised if a Tauren Druid could come close to 26k hp on this fight.  The best I've heard of from a Warrior was 21k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">04-09-2007, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Argussian Compass and the quest reward from Karazhan (18 stam/45 arcane resist).  I assure you the latter is only for the stam :p  If I had my rep up, I'd use the KoT trinket so I could get the extra resilience.  If I were tanking Hydross, I would definately be concerned about capping my defense/resil, but for the adds SotF is sufficient.  The most important thing is to get +225 of each resist; a very difficult feat if you try to be uncrittable as well.  In this situation, where you should expect to be crit and cannot dodge magic attacks, resilience is far better than defense.</div></div><hr />
