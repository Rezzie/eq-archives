<br />
I got ahold of my Tier 4 Shoulders and Leggings, as well as the Belt (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32769) off the Raven God (Anzu).<br />
<br />
Problem is, I'd take a major fall in hit rating were I to equip all of them in my DPS set (Currently using: Sun-gilded Shoulders, Clefthoof Hide Leggings, and Socrethar's Girdle). Right now, I have 132 hit rating (8% chance to hit, roughly). Obviously, I want to equip Tier 4 for the 2pc bonus. So, just with those, I'd go down to about 105 Hit Rating, and with the belt I'd go down to 85(ish).<br />
<br />
Here's what I'm curious about: I've kept looking all over Druid Forums and WoWwiki and no one really seems certain. Some say 100 hit rating, some say 8.6% chance to hit, others say 5% chance to hit (100 hit rating, I believe), etc. Ex-feral in my guild has a little less than 100 hit rating, I believe, and he said he didn't miss much that he could recall.<br />
<br />
So, does anyone know how much hit rating to aim for?</div></div><hr />

You are 100% correct.</div></div><hr />

Definately dropping the excess, then. Goes to show you, I should have come here first, rather than search all over the place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While on raid, your most important dps stat is +hit.  There is very little that can make up for losing it.  That being said, with the 2pc t4 bonus, if you are otherwise gaining some crit% with those pieces as well, it's probably worth it.</div></div><hr />
