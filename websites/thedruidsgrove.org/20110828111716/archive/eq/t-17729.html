<br />
It's a Macintosh only server that's capped at PoP. The code is patched up to roughly  2003. We have the old models, spell effects and old versions of some of your favorite zones like: PoSky, PoM, Hate, Ro and Freeport. As well as the old quests. We have PoP pre nerf versions of Xegony, Betoxxulos, RZtW and the Rathe Council, all good for gamers that want a challenge.<br />
<br />
My guild, Temerity (http://www.temerityguild.org)   is the top on Al'Kabor. We are just getting into the Elemental planes and plan to kill our first Elemental boss this late spring, early summer of this year.<br />
<br />
There is currently a lot of buzz in this thread over at the Fires of Heaven website here (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/38234-eqmac-those-starting-up-mac-server.html)  .  It seems some people are getting tired of the progression servers and looking for, what is in their opinion,  the best of what EQ had to offer before getting bloated and too easy with all the expansions.<br />
<br />
You do need a Mac to play, but these FoH guys are snatching them up pretty fast or running Hackintosh on their PCs successfully.<br />
<br />
You can read more on the server at EQMac (http://www.eqmac.com/index.html) <br />
They have a free 30 day trial download.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for a genuine, old-school EQ experience, think about checking out our little server. Once you get into the community, you'll probably not want to leave.<br />
<br />
Feel free to ask any questions concerning the server, I'll try to answer them a.s.a.p. You can post here or PM me.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, love Druids Grove :D<br />
