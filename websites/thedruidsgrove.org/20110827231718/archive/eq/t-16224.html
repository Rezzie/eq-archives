  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />

  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  How about run speed buffs? Nope even a ranger is our equal in that.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  OK so lets give up on spells because ours are at best equal and in most cases far inferior.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  Combat?<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />

  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  I know we must be best at running away.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  Nope a wizzy is our equal in that.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  And now I see the new spell lists in development and start looking and what do I see? The gaps are getting larger yet. <br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  The Wizzy has a DD spell that does over 10K without a crit&#8230; OMG Our best DOT only does 7200 max and a Wizzy can cast his spell twice in that time.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  We aren&#8217;t even the best Kiters, Rangers can kite better than us. All they have to do is snare and arrow to death. And they can deal with 10 or 15 red mobs at a time. I&#8217;ve seen it done. Several times. If we Kite and run out of mana all we can do is throw rocks until snare wears off and then run.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  I love my druid and He is a well respected officer in his guild and is requested in groups because I never panic, and I can back up just about anybody at need, but that is all I am a back up. Never the hero always the sidekick.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  SOE we need an upgrade to become an equal class not more hand me downs and afterthoughts, at least make some items with decent AC bonuses on them so we don&#8217;t fall over every time a red mob looks at us. The cleric in the party can take more punishment than we can because they get to wear metal armor and we are stuck with leather.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
 lvl because it has to be toned down so much compared to the others to allow us to complete it. Yes I soloed it from one end to the other. Look at your tracking in the zones we have to go to for our 1.0, most of the mobs are gray to us at 55   If you think this is just a rant or bad day thing think about this Druid epic 1.0 I soloed it at 60thth.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  It is sad to think that Sony thinks so little of the great and noble Druid, we are the protectors of the woodlands, the friends and kin of the animals, and the red headed step children of EQ&#8230;</div></div><hr />

We actually can move faster then any other class (baring items) due to our ability to Teleport and Cast movement rate increasing buffs.<br />

Actually it's because of the innate mitigation differiance &amp; difference in overcap returns on that AC value.  They could give us Plate level AC and you wouldn't see a huge difference because our overcap returns are the worst of any class except silk casters.<br />

Maybe I haven't looked into weather we are the best at it or not but have noted this has very minimal effect on combat at best. Try this, /log one of your combat sessions and then go back and look at mobs debuffed verses mobs not debuffed. You will see that on average the mobs die 1 to 2 ticks faster. That is a whole lot of mana on creatures for very little DPS return. We would be better off hitting them with our weapons wish gives an average of 3 to 4 ticks faster with a good weapon.<br />

Furnspur RK III 499 per hit http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=11768<br />
Scortching Skin RK III 549 per hit http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=10722<br />
<br />
How exactly is this better because furnspur last 1 tick longer and look at the mana cost. 800 for Furnspur vr 390 for Scortching Skin.<br />
<br />
Then go to the top singles ours 72 per hit for 15 minutes.<br />
Theirs 81 per hit for 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
again how exactly is this better? and to add insult to injury ours is 72nd level theirs is 71st.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Incorrect.  Form of the Hunter is 77% outdoor only.  Flight of Eagles is 65%.  Spirit of Eagle, the Ranger's best movement buff is 60%<br />
<br />
&lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt;&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;The fastest horse still beats those speeds but point is valid I can see why an extra 5% run speed would make you want a druid in the party instead of a ranger.&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
 Which tells me you do not quite understand what Alpha means.  It means untuned.  It means untested.  It means highly subject to extensive change.<br />
&lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; <br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Yes I understand what alfa means I am not an idiot, but if this is their consept for beta test than we are truly going to be hurting after the next expansion. These upgrades are far short of what is needed to put druids back into the game. A sinple fix would be give us a one spell all resists buff for 75 points each... It would be a buff people would want because it only takes 1 slot instead of the four we need now. Or make or net damage shield last for 30 minutes as... Or an invis that doesn't drop off if you walk within 200 feet of a zone... <br />
<br />
 Actually it's because of the innate mitigation differiance &amp; difference in overcap returns on that AC value.  They could give us Plate level AC and you wouldn't see a huge difference because our overcap returns are the worst of any class except silk casters.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
<br />
So now you tell me that not only does the armor available to me have less AC bonus but I also am inefective at using it? That really helps...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Due to the fact you can't count.<br />
<br />
Fernspur is 499 x 8 hits.  That means it deals 3992 Damage at minimum assuming all 8 hits land.  It also has a 10% chance to proc Wild Fernspurs which equals 8 hits of 998, or a total of 7984 unresistable damage.  In addition to this the buff is extended by SCRM AA and is instant cast.<br />
<br />
Mage Skin DS is a max of 4 hits, giving them a Total of 2196.  This makes Fernspur 45% more powerful at the cost of twice as many hits to deal the damage.  On a Wild Fernspur Proc this makes Fernspur 68% more powerful.</div></div><hr />

Odd last time I checked just about every if not every class could get invisibility  AA, I know for a fact rangers can get the group one, so again how does this make us best in this?<br />
 <br />
 If you would have read the parses you would know the effect Debuffs have on raid mobs (and in tough group exp mobs Hand of Ro helps alot).<br />
<br />
I have read the parses but I did something even more valuable I did actual experiments. Have you done this or are you just repeating what you have heard?<br />
<br />
When a mob has an AC of 2.5K lowering it by 15 doesn't mean anything, and decreasing attack on a mob that has an attack of 2K is pretty meaningless. But lets decrease a mobs fire resist by 72 lets see that will bring him down to what 500 instead of 572. Did you even read the stats on the raid mobs before you went on the raid? Most raid mobs have HPs in the 100s of K, by casting this spell you have increased everyone damage output by about 2% on average. That means over the entire combat the mob takes an extra 2000 hp of damage. For a mana cost of 165 if you only have to cast it once in that time. If the Combat lasts only 100 ticks that is a DPS of 3.6 points per second. Congrats a warrior with a toothpick has that beat.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
  I agree we need some help but all that if<br />

<br />
If your only lowering a mobs AC by 15 then your doing somethng wrong.<br />
Loweing the attack of a mob (any mob) with a moderate DI value has significant impact in adjusting the average DI value to a lower interger and drastically decreases the chance of DI 20 rounds.  This holds true for 98% of content out there barring exceptions like Delvin in Dagger form and a few mobs from Gates of Discord.  If you have parses which disprove all the parsing I have done, as well as all the parsing the warriors on TSW have done since my intial research, I invite you to share it.<br />
<br />
As far as AC being lowered it's multiplicative. It's not just X% increase per person, it's a variable increase realtive to the attack of the player and mAC value of the mob in question which determines the resultant DPS increase.<br />
<br />
Finally if a Mob has a Resist value is 575, plus the difference in resist formula from level difference you are not likely to be landing a -200 Fire spell anyway, and should be using cold.<br />

Yes, lots of people have cleric alts.  I have one myself; I play both my druid main and cleric alt on nearly all of our raids.<br />

What you have to remember is that most people cannot 2-box a cleric very effectively.  I can, but it has taken me years of practice (I have 2-boxed my druid main and cleric alt on nearly all of our raids for the past 3 years).  Sure, a 2-boxed cleric may be adequate for some situations, but most people I know prefer a good druid over a cleric alt, except when massive AE damage is involved--and I know Fenier is working on getting Lunarlight bumped up to an appropriate power level for that reason.</div></div><hr />

Yet my 40 Mage can take on three reds at a time and barely break a sweat.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  I love my druid he was the first class I picked when I started playing, He is the character that I most empathize with, and he is the one I play the most. But it can be very discouraging to get into a fight with a Light Blue or Green Mob and get my fanny handed to me on a platter. I should not be having this much trouble with this toon, I am 68th level and have 6.2K HPs, 6K mana, and an AC almost 1.4K unbuffed. With Buffs and the right campfire I can hit 10K HP, 8K mana, and AC 1.7K and with this got plastered by a light blue mob last night.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  The reasons;<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  He hit me and I couldn’t cast a spell, my spells get interrupted by everything. Look a fly landed on your nose, your spell is interrupted. I have even had my spells interrupted when casting buffs while standing still.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  I take more damage from mob attacks than any one else in the party, the other day I had a gray hit me for 1.2K.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  And because of these 2 things my DPS output is terrible, I do more DPS with my weapon than with my spells. It is a joke in the group that I have to be covered more than the cleric because if I get looked at mean I’m dead.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  If I am not mobbed I get great DPS but if I draw agro I am dead as a mackerel before anyone can react.<br />
  &lt;!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--&gt; &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;<br />
  I need new life in my druid, and I am sorry in a good party druid debuffs don’t count for much. Raids may be different but then I don’t raid. My greatest contribution to my groups is DSs and I can outrun mobs so I can lead off the adds. Run off mob succor and rejoin party.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there anything we NEED to do best? It isn't all about being the best at a single ability. Historically druids have been a multi-talented class. I hesitate to use &quot;jack of all trades&quot; since it implies mediocrity at all of them but really the best a competent druid can really aspire to is to be really good, but not necessarily the best, in many different skills.<br />

I play a 75 druid as well as a 75 mage and 75 wizard and I'd much rather solo with the druid.

Personally, I'd like to see a 40 mage take on 3 reds at a time. Let me know when you do this again and I'll make a level 1 on your server and run there to watch.

<br />
If a mob is only alive for 24 hits then the value of all debuffs, including slow reduces drastically due to the high DPS of the group in question.  I don' thave parse numbers for Vald spiders handy, but most exp trash mobs hit only around 40% of the time on a content geared Tank.<br />
<br />
Additonally, 24 hits is a short sample size.  If you were to take the hit logs of your spiders to come up with say 2400 Hits debuffed and 2400 hits normal, you would see the same pattern play out.  It's just not as clear in short fights.<br />

Yeah, I still would like to see a 40 mage solo 3 level 43 or higher Burning Wood giants at the same time. Maybe you're kiting two of them around while your pet tanks one but I'm not convinced a 40 mage pet can solo a 43 giant without the mage stopping long enough to heal the pet frequently. I suppose you can run the 2 giants far enough away to get the 4 seconds or so you need to stop and heal. But such an encounter is hardly what I would consider taking on 3 reds at once, which implies battling the 3 of them all at the same time.<br />

A 40 mage pet can beat down a 43 giant from start to finish without you casting one spell? I haven't played a mage at that level in a long time but that sounds surprisingly powerful for a PC pet, especially against giants.</div></div><hr />

The mob is any and all 68th level mobs. If I attempt to snare it even with Mire Thorns it will break loose ( I get the message your Mire Thorns Spell has worn off of a %T ) before I can even cast a second spell. Or the Mob resists this hard to resist spell, I would say about half the times it is cast it is resisted.<br />
<br />
If I root it then I usually manage to get 1 DOT off before it breaks loose. Then all I have to do is run until I can get enough disance to reroot or re dot.<br />
<br />
If I get lucky enough to land Mire Thorns on the mob and it sticks, then I can Wasp Swarm, Imolation of the sun, run for a bit, Then Summer's Flame usually and run repeat until dead. But the usual outcome Is either Add = Death, or First attempted spell is resisted and Mob is on me before I can cast a second or run.<br />
<br />
If the Mob gets ahold of me I am dead it is that simple, usually within 6 seconds but always within 12.<br />
<br />
A great example of my spell failures is I got jumped by that Basher troll in Innothule the other day. This Mob is green to me. I cast Mire Thorns, Resisted. I ran, turned and Cast Mire Thorns again, resisted. I Tried Savage roots Resisted, I ran, I turned and tried Wasp swarm, You guessed it resisted. I tried Imolation of the Sun, lets all say it together, Resisted.<br />
Mob caught me I spent the next 12 seconds stunned and then had to get cleric to rez me in Guild Lobby.</div></div><hr />

Try going to the Bazaar and looking at a summoned lucid belt, it is a pet toy that is good for an extra 850 Hit points then add a complete set of eidolons plate armor and that brings the total up to 1250 extra hit points, then add temp on top of that to the pet and you have 2050 extra hit points. For a 40th level pet that gives the pet around 8KHP and an AC around 1700, this makes the giants in BW look like candy...</div></div><hr />

That's actually a bad example, since old world guards are more resisant by design then most raid mobs due to the fact they are there to protect newbies, not be killed by players.  While you can kill a Guard, they are not intended to be killed, and are thus extra difficult to kill.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.... according to the link above, from the magician's very own web site, the earth pet summonable at level 40 has 1450 HPs, not the 3800+ you imply in your numbers. Magicians get the most robust pets in EQ but they ain't that robust. <br />

<br />
The undead in Direwind Cliffs<br />
All Mobs in Walls of Slaughter<br />
Bears in Icefall? (I think that is were they are)<br />

<br />

<br />
I have all but given up on root spells they never hold for more than 1 hit and usually end up getting me killed because they agro mobs beyond the warriors ability to get them off of me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 You need to watch out for adds.  If your soloing you may need to harmony pull things.<br />
<br />
The adds usually add after the pull not during it I have no trouble pulling just one creature. What usually happens is I will pull one and then while trying to kite him a wanderer comes by and goes oh look a fight...<br />
<br />
 As far as mob speed goes if you see a resist move first to create distance, then attempt to resnare.  Mire Thorns should not resist normally however.<br />
<br />
It is more of a speed/range thing. If the mobs are inside my range then they will hit me before the spell casts. If I am out of range I cant cast the spell till they get within range... It is a vicious circle that usually ends in an out of body experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

If you say raid gear, then no thank you I don't raid. I have been invited in 3 raids and I was used as cannon fodder to keep the tanks alive each time and then the raid said sorry we don't rez during a raid. So I got no EXP out of it and no loot. I got nothing but a 4% loss to EXP and a bad taste in my mouth for raids. (No this was not my guild and I won't say which guild it was.)<br />

<br />
This mob attacks me on sight every time and always has and is green to me, it should not be hitting me for over 2K of damage at a time. The Spiders in Vald only hit me for 1k on average and they are around 75th lvl mobs.<br />

Yes I look out of place with this group but as long as they can keep agro off of me I add decent DPS and oddly enough I like the place because my Mire Thorns spell works there the most.</div></div><hr />

Hmm.... according to the link above, from the magician's very own web site, the earth pet summonable at level 40 has 1450 HPs, not the 3800+ you imply in your numbers. Magicians get the most robust pets in EQ but they ain't that robust. <br />
<br />
I don't have any toons on your server but with invis and a little luck I might be able to run a level 1 to BW and if so, I'd love to see your level 40 mage pet solo a giant without a single heal.<br />
<br />
I looked up the info from this website and re-ran my numbers from the combat log taking the 30pt/tick regen rate into acount.<br />
<br />
Pet Calculated HP 1457, Listed 1450. (With Gear ~3500hp)<br />
Giant Calculated HP 2326 (I have not found a listed HP for them and am assuming 30Pt/tick regen same as pet)<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4453<br />
<br />
Mob hit to pet average 45pts, average number of hits per minute 24 or DPS of 18. Damage done after 1 minute of combat = 1080<br />
Pet hit to mob average 75pts, avgerage number of hits per minute 26 or DPS of 32.5. Damage after 1 minute of combat = 1950<br />
<br />
Monster dead in  12 ticks or 1 minute 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
I do Have to add that my mage is twinked to the gills for his lvl. I have spent over 500K plat on his gear.<br />
<br />
Try it it works quite well.</div></div><hr />

I have seen these bears kited 15 to 20 at a time by a 75 ranger. I am not joking about this. I told a friend I needed a quick AA point and he said come with me.<br />
<br />
He snared around 15 bears and backed in circles for 35 minutes shooting arrows with his druzzil's bow and snared adds and wear offs as needed. he killed every single one of them in about 35 minutes and gave me a Ping and a 1/2 while I just watched. I never helped at all.<br />
<br />
I told him he needed to start charging people to watch it because it is amazing as all heck to watch.<br />

<br />
At the rate I get EXP from those I will be 5 years before I ding 69. I need about 10 to 15 kills per little blue bubble. There are 125 blue bubbles per lvl.<br />
That is best case 1250 kills to lvl, worst case 1875. And that will be very very boreing after the first 200 kills.<br />

<br />
See answer above and is such a late snare a good idea. If I draw agro having the snare on the creature has kept me alive many times.<br />
<br />
And one other thing about this are druid heals inherently more aggravating to mobs?<br />
<br />
Our cleric can toss heals around like they are feathers and very seldom draws agro. I send in a Sylvan Infusion and Blammo the mobs come to shake my hand.</div></div><hr />

If you fight in icefall or valdeholm name a mob you solo that cast on you?<br />
 <br />
Steppes might cast some but not much.<br />
 <br />
So might point is you want to survive more (hps) and be able to cast more (mana) and resists help you do neither. Also get the braaiinnss aug to put in your shield (ac in shield gives better return then any other spot)<br />
 <br />
At lvl 70 you can get some really nice type 12 mana/hp augs from DoN vendor.<br />
 <br />
If you spent 500k on your mage then I am guessing you also have the pp to get the radiant cut augs with affliction efficieny 5 on it and maybe consider getting one with Improved dodge III on one.<br />
 <br />
Until you get certain aa's I think you will be frustrated trying to solo mobs way above you and probably resisted ALOT.<br />
 <br />
a 75 ranger is totally different from 68 druid hands down he won't get resisted as much as you. Also if you think about it you want to find the weakest lvl dblue mob you can and solo those because they will die faster then reds, yellows and white and still get good aa exp.<br />
 <br />
Good luck to you whatever you choose.<br />
 <br />
I forgot to add you should look into the relic quests for a ring, earring and an aug that would help you out quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

You 'are' aware that Mire Thorns has a 3 minute duration as opposed to a 15 minute duration yes?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have all but given up on root spells they never hold for more than 1 hit and usually end up getting me killed because they agro mobs beyond the warriors ability to get them off of me.<br />
<br />
Spore Spiral normally lasts full duration due to it being chromatic.  Root AA also decrease the chances of it breaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
The adds usually add after the pull not during it I have no trouble pulling just one creature. What usually happens is I will pull one and then while trying to kite him a wanderer comes by and goes oh look a fight...<br />
<br />
Do it in the reverse order.  Kill the Wanderer first.  Time it, then kill the other mob.  That way the wanderer doesn't jump you.<br />
<br />
It is more of a speed/range thing. If the mobs are inside my range then they will hit me before the spell casts. If I am out of range I cant cast the spell till they get within range... It is a vicious circle that usually ends in an out of body experience.<br />
<br />
Get an extended Range Augment.<br />
<br />
If you say raid gear, then no thank you I don't raid. I have been invited in 3 raids and I was used as cannon fodder to keep the tanks alive each time and then the raid said sorry we don't rez during a raid. So I got no EXP out of it and no loot. I got nothing but a 4% loss to EXP and a bad taste in my mouth for raids. (No this was not my guild and I won't say which guild it was.)<br />
<br />
You are a priest, it's not a uncommon expectation to expect you to heal in a raid environment.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes - there is no reason you can not get 200 / hp mana per slot armor at 68.  At 75 This goes upto 280~ hp / mana per slot all from groupable content before augments.<br />
<br />
If your using gear which is 125~ hp/mana or worse, then you can and should upgrade it.<br />
<br />
<br />
This mob attacks me on sight every time and always has and is green to me, it should not be hitting me for over 2K of damage at a time. The Spiders in Vald only hit me for 1k on average and they are around 75th lvl mobs.<br />
<br />
I'll repeat again.  Old World Guards were not intended to be killed and are drastic undercons.</div></div><hr />

It's a function of what's important to you 'now'  The zones you've been listing that you exp in do not typically have mobs which cast or AE.  You do not raid.  +Mana or +Hp/mana augments would serve you better in such a situation.<br />

This I would need to see in the game code itself My experience with it argues against this statement very much. If I crit Nuke before the Mob gets below 85% I draw agro every time, No fail. If I crit after the 85% mark I never draw agro. Hence the technique of Snare, DOT, DOT, Nuke, Repeat till dead.:gunfight::boohoo:<br />
<br />
I am going to be changing that to Snare, Debuff, DOT, DOT, Nuke, Repeat till dead after this conversation.</div></div><hr />

The cleric usually uses CH and ask me to keep Sylvan Infusion up for backup. Her Complete heal almost never draws agro maybe 1 in 100 times she casts it. SI gets me agro 1 in 3. it must be a function of her AAs she has chosen I will ask her to let me know what she has gotten.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty easy to confirm when you have the code in front of you showing that its using the value pulled straight from the spell data, not what it actually lands for, and the in-game debug showing the exact NPC aggro generated that matches the expectations set by the code.<br />

I wasn't just asked to heal. The first time I was asked to be the primary healer and concentrate on the main tank. The main tank was in a group with 2 72+ clerics in it. When my chain healing of the warrior drew agro, He moved to another MOB and left me to fend for myself against a raid MOB.<br />
<br />
The second time I was asked to nuke, I started nuking and got summoned, when The MOB switched to me the warrior moved to another MOB and left me to fend for myself against the MOB.<br />

The last time, I was told to Nuke again and back up the healer, this is my normal mode so I was comfortable with it. Then at the final MOB, He summoned in a bunch of sub mobs. They went after the healers, The tank protected the clerics first understood, Then the mage, Then the other warrior. and by the time he got to me I had already been dead for close to a minute. I get a tell from the warrior &quot;Sorry about that dude but you weren't going to get any treasure anyway because your not in our guild. Maybe you will at least survive next time.&quot; I answered &quot;There won't be a next time.&quot;<br />

Ok, let me see if I can explain this.<br />
<br />
You have afaik, no ranks of SCS.  This means every time you cast you gain full aggro from the spell you use.<br />
<br />
In the first several percent of combat on a trash mob (which is basically the first 10 seconds) it's possible for a mob to be at 85 - then your nuke hits.  Aggro is calucated off the base damage of the spell, so if you were to use, say Sol Strike, you'd gain 2000~ aggro (That value may be off, but it's good enough for what I am trying to explain).  <br />
<br />
If the tank hasn't generated that level of aggro yet - and they may not have, it's dependent on the tank in question, this may shift you to the top of the hate list, and the mob will either summon you, or run towards you.<br />
<br />
The tank will then be incapable of regaining aggro until they exceed your aggro value, or they get a sucessful taunt. <br />
<br />
It's important to note that DoTs have a hate value on the cast, but you will continue to build aggro as the DoT runs.  This means it's easier for you to pull aggro with stacked DoTs then it is to chain nuke something.<br />

I don't remember the names of them as I was never told, But one of them involved a Big Fat MOB in a tower that wouldn't leave his room. And I seem to remember something about BoT.<br />

These were about 3-6 months ago so it is a little hard to remember them very well. I just remember the warriors final tell very clearly, and the fact that I came very close to leaving the game after that because everybody kept telling me you had to raid to get good equipment.<br />

What you say is probably true after all you have no reason to lie. I just have a hard time believing it. Every time I draw agro it is from a heal or a crit nuke before the mob gets to 85%. I can nuke three times back to back with the mob at 90% and not draw agro. But if even one of them is a crit. Blammo!</div></div><hr />

They have less hitpoints. If you are KT flagged, try killing in the primal area of Yxxta, they have low hitpoints and don't resist your snares. But they will hit hard and fast if they catch you.<br />
<br />
And you can use your ensnare to overwrite mire. Very useful in kiting. <br />
<br />
Also, if you are exp hungery and want to maximize your LoD, you can always fight snareable fleeing mobs. Pull mob, kite till fleeing, then leave it alone, pull next mob, rinse and repeat until you have a bunch of snared fleeing mobs. Blow you LoD, get some sweet exp.

I see no reason to put snare first. Snare is a huge agro tool.<br />
Try Debuff, dot, dot, nuke, nuke, and snare at 50-70% this should help you a lot.<br />
 <br />
Agro management is the most important skill for anyone to learn.  As you progress through the game environment you will be running into more mobs that will have a higher chance to one or two round you.  <br />
Your mana does you no good when you are having an &quot;out of body experience&quot;  <br />
Adjust your play style and agro level to your environment and reevaluate on an encounter basis untill you find your comfort level.</div></div><hr />

Ok, without exact encounter names, this is going to be a bit more difficult, but I'll try to present a viewpoint of someone who leads raids.<br />
<br />
I wasn't just asked to heal. The first time I was asked to be the primary healer and concentrate on the main tank. The main tank was in a group with 2 72+ clerics in it. When my chain healing of the warrior drew agro, He moved to another MOB and left me to fend for myself against a raid MOB.<br />
<br />
This healing setup is viable for several targets.  It's not that uncommon.  So to better understand your complinant see if you can remember the answers to the following questions:<br />
<br />
Did the mob he was orignally tanking die prior to the target switch - and / or did additional mobs spawn during the encounter?  Raid mobs spawning adds (several at a time) has been common practice since PoP.  If the raid was light on tanks he may have only been able to get one of them, which left you with the add.<br />
<br />
The second time I was asked to nuke, I started nuking and got summoned, when The MOB switched to me the warrior moved to another MOB and left me to fend for myself against the MOB.<br />
<br />
Are you totally sure that he switched targets, and didn't just fail taunt?  Tanks 'are' able to pull mobs back to them, with taunt, but it can and does fail.  This may leave you tanking for slightly longer then your able to survive.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed is all of your comments center around a single tank.  Raids typically need several to survive most raid content past Luclin.  You need to remember in a raid setting running around is not conductive to living longer.  While kitting may seem an excellant idea, people have a harder time getting the mob from you that way.  I am not saying you did kite, or you are in the wrong in any way - just something to consider.<br />
<br />
Deaths on raids are common, esp for people who's gear is less then the content they are raiding as a guest or applicant.  When my guild was doing Gates progression, Kelekdrix in Inktu'ta flat out owned our applicants due to the upwards of 7k AE damage they can generate when the event starts.<br />
<br />
In any event where you deal damage - and this applies down to the group level, over aggroing is apt to get you killed.  As we've said before SCS AA line will help you draw aggro less, and allow you to nuke / heal more often without generating the full amount of hate that goes with it.<br />
<br />
Finally on any encounter where adds spawn on or near the raid it's expected that 1 or 2 people will get unlucky and owned prior to the raid locking them down.  Having raided from Kunark and now entering DoD and PoR it's the same situation.  Adds kill people, be it in Vex-Thal, or Queen Sendaii.  <br />
<br />
Now I'm sorry your raiding experience wasnt a positve one, but I would suggest not writing the entire thing off based on your interactions with that one guild.<br />

Try this, /log one of your combat sessions and then go back and look at mobs debuffed verses mobs not debuffed. You will see that on average the mobs die 1 to 2 ticks faster. That is a whole lot of mana on creatures for very little DPS return. We would be better off hitting them with our weapons wish gives an average of 3 to 4 ticks faster with a good weapon.<br />
<br />
Yes I understand what alfa means I am not an idiot, but if this is their consept for beta test than we are truly going to be hurting after the next expansion. These upgrades are far short of what is needed to put druids back into the game. A sinple fix would be give us a one spell all resists buff for 75 points each... It would be a buff people would want because it only takes 1 slot instead of the four we need now. Or make or net damage shield last for 30 minutes as... Or an invis that doesn't drop off if you walk within 200 feet of a zone... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So now you tell me that not only does the armor available to me have less AC bonus but I also am inefective at using it? That really helps...<br />
<br />
Judging by the bolded stuff, I'd be inclined to disagree with the underlined and bolded part. Also, the benefit form our ATK debuffs is just that, the ATK debuff parts. People can post parses for days cataloging the benefit they provide. You also must be oblivious to the group camo AA.<br />

When a mob has an AC of 2.5K lowering it by 15 doesn't mean anything, and decreasing attack on a mob that has an attack of 2K is pretty meaningless. But lets decrease a mobs fire resist by 72 lets see that will bring him down to what 500 instead of 572. Did you even read the stats on the raid mobs before you went on the raid? Most raid mobs have HPs in the 100s of K, by casting this spell you have increased everyone damage output by about 2% on average. That means over the entire combat the mob takes an extra 2000 hp of damage. For a mana cost of 165 if you only have to cast it once in that time. If the Combat lasts only 100 ticks that is a DPS of 3.6 points per second. Congrats a warrior with a toothpick has that beat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm going to totally disagree with that &quot;I'm not an idiot&quot; statement you made.</div></div><hr />

Convergance of Spirits<br />
Hungry Vines Recourse<br />
Fernspur<br />
<br />
Fernspur is 499 x 8 hits.  That means it deals 3992 Damage at minimum assuming all 8 hits land.  It also has a 10% chance to proc Wild Fernspurs which equals 8 hits of 998, or a total of 7984 unresistable damage.  In addition to this the buff is extended by SCRM AA and is instant cast.<br />
<br />
Mage Skin DS is a max of 4 hits, giving them a Total of 2196.  This makes Fernspur 45% more powerful at the cost of twice as many hits to deal the damage.  On a Wild Fernspur Proc this makes Fernspur 68% more powerful.<br />
<br />
Sir, when was the last time anyone seriously used Hungry Vines in any setting? That spell is the equivalent of the turds my dog leaves in the backyard. I'm not going to bother going through the same old song and dance as to why Fernspur isn't a good spell again. Also, SCRM doesn't affect the num hits part of Fernspur anyway, which is the real limiting factor of the spell. We are also trying to get the DS removed from SotW/CoS or at least have upgraded versions or some such that lack the DS component.</div></div><hr />

In any case, it seems there's a general shortage of healing in the game, and as one of only three classes that can call healing a primary role, good druids are in high demand--sometimes even as the &quot;hero&quot; (sole healer).  No, we can't do it as well as a cleric can, but we do it well enough for most purposes.<br />

Realizing, that Druids by Nature don't do any one thing better than another class, we do however do a lot of things well and is why we are so versatile and valuable.<br />
 <br />
My Druid has been what I call a Healing Druid since he was born. Most of the Druids in my guild, Sanity's Edge on Povar (Formally Valheru), are required to be healers. We quite often have mostly and on some occassions all Druids in the CHR. We are currently farming CoA, have gotten into Qvic, ToB, DSK, 2 kills as a guild away from Demi-Plane and close on a Vish kill. If it weren't for our Druids, we wouldstill be in Time. <br />
 <br />
So in my opinion, Druids, are extremely valuable and needed. Just wish Sony would upgrade our CH and not give us too many more snares.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iv'e had many doubts about the dev team but it just takes a while to get into the ideal moment where you understand the situation and know which abilities would be best suited.</div></div><hr />

KR won't get upgraded, just like CH won't ever be upgraded.</div></div><hr />
