I agree though, about the Steeloak problem.<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
And the answer is to make SoE as fast as FoE.<br />
<br />
Simple fix but they haven't done it.<br />
Lower level spell with exact same effect does not overwrite higher level spell, simple as that.<br />
I don't think so because other classes don't have this problem.  Only druids do.  Funny that, huh?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Steeloak Skin and Blessing of Steeloak are from the same era so there is a better reason for wanting the single version to overwrite the group version.<br />
 <br />
Would rather see when I get an extended buff, and someone casts that buff on me for some reason, it doesn't overwrite and reduce the timer.</div></div><hr />

I'm think Symbol of Balikor vs Balikor's Mark and Clairvoyance vs Voice of Clairvoyance overwrite each other, but not 100% sure.<br />
<br />
Lion's Stength will overwrite Strength of Might as well as Talisman of Might and vice versa despite all three having same effect.<br />

It's all quite annoying.  Group versions overwriting singles make sense.  Singles overwriting group doesn't make sense and especially annoying that Steeloak is the only exception.  Also wish that Lion's and Might blocked each other so players wouldn't confuse needing one when already got the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a spell does not land it does not take any mana, if some tard in my guild already has Blessing of Steeloak and does not see the spell icon and asks for it again, I waste no mana on that stupid arse. <br />
<br />
If their BoS is about to fade in 5 minutes, then I either look at mine, and then ask our druids group if someone wants to MGB if mine is on the same timer as theirs, or I MGB it myself.  If its out of sync with others BoS I then ask them to drop BoS and cast a single buff. Seems like more work, but it uses less mana.</div></div><hr />

My enchanter refuses to buff anyone who asks for a C.<br />
So the only times you will buff someone with Clarity line of spells, is if they ask with the proper name? Sure, makes sense if you play on a roleplay server, or never wanna buff anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, could I get a Koadic's Endless Intellect buff please?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hi, could I get a Clairvoyance buff please?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is even without spelling errors. Now imagine not knowing how it was spelled or whatever?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I'd like to get a Kodiacs End Intel buff pls?&quot;<br />
Or<br />
&quot;Gimme Clay pls&quot; etc. etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&quot; was established as the abbreviation for the entire line of Clarity spells<br />
C1 = Clarity<br />
C2 = Gift of Pure Thought<br />
C3 = Koadic's Endless Intellect<br />
C4 = Tranquility<br />
C5 = Voice of Quellious<br />
C6 = Clairvoyance<br />
<br />
Just as &quot;skin&quot; is the abbreviation most people use for our HP buff line of spell.<br />
<br />
There's only like several thousand different spell names in EQ, having to remember each and everyone is impossible, unless you're Rainman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-24-2006, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the server.  On Ayonae Ro we used to use acronyms like KEI or VoQ, for the most part.<br />
<br />
Sure there are thousands of spells, but it's really not hard to learn the small subset of spells that are sought on a daily basis.  And if you're going to ask someone for a buff (and you're not new to the game) the least you can do is learn the name of the buff that you're asking for. :P<br />
<br />
(That said, I might tease people once in a while about what they call a spell, but I don't refuse to buff because of it.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">04-24-2006, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each server has it's own acronyms for buffs, and when x-server transfers come in usually it takes a couple weeks for them to get used to the lingo for camps, buffs, and other things.  On Veeshan it was KEI, VoQ, CV, Oak, Conv, Fo7, Po9, 6-way (aka Odi in MPG), c1, c2 (bandit camps in paludal), etc.. We merged with Luclin which used C#, 10, 7, 9, Viction, Odi, b1, b2.  What's in use now is a huge jumble of both servers, but the point is whatever it's called, players still know what is being talked about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeyn Kaidyrsi</div><div class="date">04-24-2006, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I have no problem with someone using KEI for Koadic's Endless Intellect.  That's an easily recognizable abbreviation, as VoQ is for Voice of Quellious, and CV for Clairvoyance/Voice of Clairvoyance. Which are the commonly used abbreviations for those buffs on my server.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&quot; may have been established as the abbreviation for the entire line of Clarity spells, but the only players on my server who regularly called Clarity II &quot;C2&quot; were enchanters. When Koadic's Endless Intellect came out, some enchanters referred to it as C3, but most called it KEI.<br />
<br />
Many more players called Breeze and Clarity crack or mind candy in my youth (Kunark era).  I still hear those terms used by older players.  One could say &quot;crack&quot;/&quot;mind candy&quot; was established as the abbreviation for the entire line of Clarity spells.<br />
<br />
Why does my enchanter refuse to buff anyone who asks for a C?  If someone is going to be rude and send me an unsolicited tell asking for a buff, at least use an abbreviation that's easily recognizable.  Her spellbook doesn't have any spells listed as C3, C5, C6.  If I'd never heard the term KEI, at least I could recognize Koadic's Endless Intellect as being the desired spell.  Not so with a C.  I know enchanters just as annoyed with &quot;C,&quot; as some druids are with &quot;10.&quot;<br />
<br />
To be completely honest, she doesn't &quot;refuse.&quot;  She simply doesn't respond to the tell or an OOC. (Just like I don't answer the phone unless I want to talk to the caller.)<br />
<br />
As for &quot;skin&quot;?  Since many of the druid HP buffs have been named &quot;Skin&quot;, it makes sense most people refer to our HP buffs as &quot;skin.&quot;  Just as it made sense for Blessing/Protection of the Nine to be called 9, and Clarity II to be called C2.<br />
<br />
It's easy now to know the names of the buffs you use.  Part of knowing how to play your class is knowing the buffs you use.  It just isn't that hard to remember the names of a dozen or so buffs.<br />
<br />
Although, I could have sworn the name was Kodiac's Endless Intellect.  I read Koadic as Kodiac for years.</div></div><hr />

haha, I did too for a loooooooong time.  I didn't notice until the release of the d20 EQ books while browsing through the spells to see which ones were converted<br />

So when you receive such a tell, you don't know what they mean when they say &quot;C3&quot;?  Honestly?<br />
<br />
Or are you just being a curmudgeon?  ;)<br />
<br />

Honestly?  No.  It was always called KEI.<br />
<br />
Five years ago, I didn't really mind tells asking for buffs.  Even though it took all my courage when I was a wee one to ask a player I'd met once before for a bind.  Even then, it just seemed rude for me to interrupt a stranger and ask for something.  Yet a few levels later when I finally got SoW, I was more than willing to stand there and cast SoW endlessly as every player passing me stopped and stared at me, hailed me, or asked.  But, the endless tells for SoW and for ports to wherever just weren't enough, were they?  If I declined, the initial tell was almost always followed by repeated tells begging ... or worse.  Invariably, if I did port someone, they ran off without paying the plat they'd promised.  /shrug.  The &quot;professional&quot; porters demanded plat up front, but I guess I just trusted others.<br />
<br />
Even now, very rarely is a player content with a  &quot;Sorry, I can't&quot; to their tell.  Invariably, they still follow up with additional tells begging or promising ever increasing amounts of plat.<br />
<br />
So yes.  Sending an unsolicited tell for a port or for a buff is rude.  OOC it.  If I'm not busy, I'll respond.  That is ... if the OOC isn't for C or 10 :wink:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatankawd</div><div class="date">04-24-2006, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Honestly? No. It was always called KEI&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, so you didn't know what it meant at one point in the past , until you found out what it did mean.  Then you did know.  So you continue to refuse because you previously didn't know what it meant, even though now you do?<br />
<br />
&quot;So yes. Sending an unsolicited tell for a port or for a buff is rude&quot;<br />
<br />
Nope.  According to your account, it's the followup behavior that is rude, not the request itself.  People are not required to be rude, some just are.  Those folks are still rude, even if they never send me a tell ;)<br />

Since I haven't played today I haven't encountered anyone asking for a C to be able to refuse them.<br />
<br />
I may or may not remember C3 is KEI if someone asks for it next week or so.  The percentage of players who use C3 or C6 is small.  The majority of players use KEI or CV.  There are far more important things for me to remember like ... whether it's Aura or Blessing of Devotion that's the group spell haste :wink:<br />
<br />
Ah, it probably comes down to privacy issues.  I prefer not to be approached by strangers in game, online, or in real life.  and I do consider buff/port/givemesomething tells from those strangers to be rude.  After all, can't they all see the big flashing sign over my head that says &quot;LEAVE ME ALONE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I believe the /roleplay command takes care of that.  It means a search on you doesn't show your class.<br />
<br />
So does /anon.<br />
<br />
Of course /AFK works just fine, although it won't stick when you zone.<br />
<br />
As for C3 and C6, I use the terms KEI and C6.  Using C6 is the preferred way of asking for it in my guild.  In fact, chanters (oh, sorry, ENCHANTERS:) in my guild themselves use C6, as in &quot;Will MGB C6 once I have the mana&quot;, after a wipe out.<br />
<br />
There are rude people out there.  Always have been, always will be.  But I see no need to lump every person out there in one group as rude.  I get buff requests all the time.  Most of them are polite and it makes me happy to give them.<br />
<br />
I guess you don't like doing it.  Or at least unless they ask in the way that you insist.  That is your choice.  But I find it silly to be so insistent on 'proper' phrasing before you will buff.  Again, your choice, your toon, your playing style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted if your a buffing class, sure it may get annoying cause its your(s) pet peeves.  But the way I look at is if someone asks me for whatever buffs, I will usually cast what they ask for.  I don't do it with a bad attitude.   But in the end its your choice. Anyways still I don't see why the &quot;big&quot; debate on who asks for it correctly or by what ever abbreviations.  If you don't lilke doing buff or it gets on your nerves that badly then why make a toon that has spells...?  <br />

I read Koadic as Kodiac for years. I think a lot of druids and rangers have made this mistake. <br />
 <br />
Some common spell abbreviations that we use on Saryrn (at least in my guild):<br />
 <br />
Cleric<br />
Virt = Virtue<br />
HoV = Hand of Virtue<br />
Viction = Conviction<br />
HoC = Hand of Conviction<br />
AoD = Aura of Devotion (sometimes we just call this spell haste)<br />
 <br />
Druid<br />
FoE = Flight of Eagles<br />
Lion = Lion's Str<br />
CoS = Protection of Seasons (this one annoys me a bit, most people I know now call it seasons now, I guess they feel weird asking me for a PoS buff, like I might cast something on them from the ranger)<br />
Po9 = Protection of the Nine<br />
10 = Steeloak / Blessing of Steeloak (I don't like it when people just call it oak because our regen line is also called oak. Skin, or just hp buff, would honestly be fine by me)<br />
 <br />
Enchanter<br />
GoD = Guard of Druzzil<br />
KEI = Koadic's Endless Intellect (sometimes called c3)<br />
c4 = Tranquility<br />
VoQ = Voice of Quellious (almost never called c5)<br />
c6 = Clairvoyance<br />
Haste = Speed of Salik<br />
 <br />
Paladin<br />
BSS = Brell's Stallwart Strength<br />
BBB = Brell's Brawny Bulwark<br />
Ghetto Symbol = Mark of JaRon or whoever<br />
 <br />
Ranger<br />
GoE = Guard of Earth<br />
SoT = Strength of Tunare<br />
Hunter = Strength of the Hunter<br />
Pred = Howl of the Predator<br />
 <br />
Shaman<br />
Boar = Endurance of the Boar<br />
Fort = Fortitude<br />
Fo7 = Focus of the Seventh<br />
Wunshi = Wunshi's Focusing<br />
Focus = anything in between, normally wunshi</div></div><hr />

I thought the whole thing came about from the stacking issues with conviction.. viction used to overwrite any form of skin, when they fixed it they made it so it would no longer overwrite skin but single skin could not overwrite grp as a side effect.<br />
 <br />
I hope they don't end up reintroducing that problem, that was probably much worse. Especially since you don't lose mana when single oak bounces like lhittle mentioned.<br />
 <br />
One thing they need to do as well is remove that stupid recast on oak... I think that's a remnant from like the kunark era or something and other priest classes don't have it on their respective buffs.</div></div><hr />
