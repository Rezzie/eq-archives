<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-11-2007, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now at lvl 17 I have 2 points in Thick Hide and single point in Feral Instinct.  Until I get cat form, I think it may make more sense to pick-up Brutal Impact (mostly for quick in-fight heals) rather than Feral Instinct.  Once I reach lvl 20 re-spec out of Thick Hide and take Feral Instinct since it I'll be in Cat form most of the time.<br />
<br />
IOW...<br />
10-14: Ferocity<br />
15-16: Brutal Impact<br />
17-19: Thick Hide<br />
<br />
at level 20, re-spec to...<br />
<br />
5/5 Ferocity<br />
3/3 Feral Instinct<br />
2/2 Brutal Impact<br />
1/2 Feral Swiftness<br />
<br />
Or should I keep 2/3 Thick Hide (rather than 2/2 Brutal Impact) for the 7% armor boost even in cat form?  Does 7% help all that much when it isn't multiplied by the 400% bear form boost?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  I have the money, so that isn't an issue.  I'm just trying to speed up the leveling process as much as possible.</div></div><hr />

get your damage and combat abilities which max your damageoutput!<br />
its better to take out the mobs quicker than rely on your +7% armor which is like nothing in the low lvls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-12-2007, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I would say don't get thick hide unless you are level 70 and a main tank for a raiding guild/heroic instances.<br />
<br />
But when leveling up and needing to get 5 more points in the feral tree after Ferocity, what else would you put it in? Feral Instinct is even more worthless at that level. I guess you could throw 3 points into Feral Aggression, that would benefit you more while leveling than Thick Hide or Feral Instinct.<br />
<br />
So if I were level 20 again, I would have:<br />
<br />
1/1 Nature's Grasp<br />
5/5 Ferocity<br />
2/2 Brutal Impact<br />
3/5 Feral Aggression</div></div><hr />

It does help but it won't make or break your survivability. Go for Brutal Impact unless you are serious about tanking endgame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't realize how pitiful my DPS was without Cat form until I decided to kill a mob my same level with Cat form.  So much faster!  I had told myself that I'd give Druid a chance 'till at least lvl 22.  If it was too painful, I'd go back to playing my hunter.<br />
<br />
With just bear form I felt like a Paladin.:grin:</div></div><hr />
