 <br />
Looking for some advice. I finally convinced my wife to play WoW with me for some together time. First off, we only play about once a week for 2 hours or so. We won't be uber and probably won't join a guild because of being so casual.<br />
 <br />
We went Horde since that's where my Rogue is. She rolled a Tauren Druid, so I rolled a Tauren Warrior to help her out from the start. She isn't a gamer at all, the only thing she's really played is Pac-Man.<br />
 <br />
What is your advice on gear and play style? What is the best gear type for the Druid, go 1H and a Shield or a 2H stave? I'm thinking she will be going Restoration type since she will be my healer. For these low levels, what should she spend Talent points in first?<br />
 <br />
And the Warrior, for such casual duoing... To tank should I dual wield, 1H and Shield, or a big 2 hander?<br />
 <br />
We both just got to level 6 and are just enjoying the scenic route in WoW. Thanks for any input you have!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">11-14-2006, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since druids can use shields, that makes the first few levels pretty easy.  2h staff.  <br />
<br />
Later you may find a decent 1h mace or dagger, but stick with the staves for now.<br />
<br />
If she's going to be your healer, have her put the first points into Improved Mark, then work on other resto talents like Improved Healing Touch, Reflection, Subtlety, Nature's Swiftness, etc.  <br />
<br />
In about 3 or  so weeks you'll get to redo your talents for free anyways, so use this as a learning experience.</div></div><hr />

For druid, I say go where the stats are, as you're leveling up.  If you get a good 1h + offhand, use that... if you get a good 2h afterward, use that.  (I'll leave the talent suggestions to others here.)<br />
<br />
For warrior - my personal preference is going mostly Arms spec with a 2H axe.  You can pick up axe specialization from arms and cruelty from fury and get some pretty good crits going, as well as the 2H weapon spec from arms.  Prot spec is more for heavy instance grouping situations or raiding, and fury spec is more for when you're doing damage but not tanking.  All just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Typically, though not always, staves have caster stats (int / spi / stam), and 2h Maces have melee stats (str / ati / stam).  So probably staff.<br />
<br />
I have been leveling my Tau Warrior fury speccd, dual wielding.  I also keep a shield with me, so if I do need to tank, or if I am fighting stuff that hits really hard, I can have the extra armor.  The main reason I like fury dual wield is cause of the rage generation.  Plus dual wielding is just really cool.  <br />
<br />
A slow 2h axe / mace with Mortal Strike is a REALLY nasty build, and the prefered pvp build, and I plan on trying it out when I get to 40 with my warrior (so that I can spec right into Mortal Strike), but until then, I'm loving Fury 2h.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I guess the druid will be pretty cookie-cutter, so not many choices.<br />
 <br />
The warrior on the other hand, I don't know. We are not on a PVP server, so I'm not even gonna worry about that. I enjoy my time just looking around the zones and doing quests. <br />
 <br />
My Rogue is only level 15, so I am still very new to this game. He was pretty easy, just put daggers in both hands and went to town. I was thinking that the druid/warrior team would be a good duo for doing quests. Now if I could only get the wife to be a bit more comfortable playing. Right now she gets nervous and is like &quot;what do I do, what do I do AAAACCCCKKK!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">11-15-2006, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh trust me. There is not one class I have not enjoyed playing a duo with. Leveling up with my buddies we'd have 1 of our friends play each class and we often wouldn't have us all on but I kinda got hooked on the game most and am the only one still playing today :O<br />
<br />
Anywho, as a druid I personally seemed to duo well with any class. Besides the fact that we can't rez, druids are the perfect duo class for questing / leveling.<br />
<br />
Gearwise, you'd probably want your wife to get anything since you guys are playing for fun. Probably sticking to 2h staves and maces.</div></div><hr />

It will come.  The druid is not an easy class to play well, but if you get the class down we are a powerful force to reckon with.<br />
<br />
Give her time to get used to the spells, how you take damage and how and when to crowd control.  It's a high learning curve, but those that take the time to learn it become better all around players ( IMO ). :elfbiggri</div></div><hr />

And you will have a lot more armor :)  And you can charge :) :)<br />
<br />
This may sound silly, but make sure that she knows that she can use both her heal over time spells at the same time.  Once I got bearform at lv 10 and realized that I could cast 2 HoT's on myself before switching into bear, then be virtually invulnerable for about 8 sec while the HoT's ticked, I started having a LOT more fun.<br />
<br />
Also, I dont remember when Druids get Entangling roots, but that's a fun spell.  Basically roots come out of the ground and hold the mob in place, while you go up and beat on it.</div></div><hr />

It took me forever to feel comfortable and have fun playing WoW.  I played Diablo II and Guild Wars, but I really felt like I landed on another planet when I started playing WoW.<br />
<br />
When I first rolled my druid, I found solo PvE pretty easy since I could easily recognize what form I needed to use when.  That's the advantage druids have over non-hybrid classes; we can adapt to the playing style of the mob.  If I joined up with someone else, tho, I immediately felt anxious - one because I *was* new to the game but also because having all these skill sets to choose from got a bit overwhelming and confusing and I felt I was never using the right one at the right time in the right situation.  <br />
<br />
I still feel that way at times at 60 :)  My guess is that she'll feel comfortable with more time under her belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">11-16-2006, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of good suggestions here, thanks!<br />
 <br />
For me, should I try to concentrate on DPS or Defense? Maybe duoing with a healer I should put more into DPS? That way the mob dies faster...<br />
 <br />
Or go with a Shiled and concentrate on Defense and have my wife do more DPS? I could do both, with some practice on the wife's part.</div></div><hr />
