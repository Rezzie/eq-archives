<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeotti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's about time we need a good guide from 1-65 from those who have no time to waste. I'll start off with some casual and most efficient loot/xp-wise places in Norrath/Luclin. Comments and additions are definitely needed.<br />
<br />
1-10 - Yard trash in Misty Thicket, believe me...this is the best place for EXP especially with constant nuking at the Bat Hill in the second part of Misty.<br />
<br />
10-14 - North Ro/South Ro kiting scarabs and what not can work, as well as Oasis since its mainly completely empty. Lavastorm workin with the elementals and what not works best because of the powerful nukes on Summoned.<br />
<br />
14-24 - Quickest way to 24 is definitely in Paludal Caverns. You can kite/solo up to 17 if you want (killing the critters up the cavern past the bandit camps), or if you can get a group, get right in right away. Exp starts to slow at 20-24, but its better than most places if you have a constant exp group. Should take no more than 2 days of off and on EXPing (not full 24 days mind you). If you have KEI, this makes it 10 times faster.<br />
<br />
24-34 - SK is an OK choice if you like to kite Gnolls especially with KEI, and LOIO is also good for soloing since it is completely empty nowadays. If you can, get a group in HighKeep...exp flies there just like Paludal. Once you hit 30, you can either goto Overthere, Dawnshroud, Marus Seru until 35 and group/solo (takes some time, but easy). Also, you can solo in Eastern Wastes from 30-34 if LOI/HighKeep doesn't work for you. If you're soloing in Eastern Wastes, go right from the Dragon Bridge and follow the right coast. Keep going until you hit the Coldain Camp, and if you want you can keep going until you see the lone tree. Don't use wolf form here whatever you do, oh and KEI is very useful here. Anyways, using tracking, try to pull singles of an Even or Blue cons for most efficiency. Completely avoid the Ulthork Warriors and try to pull regular Ulthorks and Walruses. The coldain camp is a great place to pull to, but they don't help...Try not to use AE nukes or anything. I found the quickest way was snare/nuke. You can also DOT since they rarely resist. KEI is extremely useful in both of these situations.<br />
<br />
34-38 - I suggest quad-kiting the ulthorks/walruses in Eastern Wastes (2 bubs per quad normally), and cougars in Iceclad at the pirate camp if you like to solo. You can get tusks from the ulthorks and walruses which you can trade in at Cobalt Scar for a random jewel (you can even get BDs). The quickest way to get EXP grouping is probably in Dreadlands or even in Overthere still..not many choices for 34-38 really.<br />
<br />
Note - KEI is a must if you really want to level as fast as possible and efficiently. Don't forget to practice spell casting.<br />
<br />
I still need some efficient places for:<br />
<br />
38-45<br />
45-50<br />
50-55<br />
55-65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glarnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1-10 Field of Bones<br />
10-17 Either Kurns Tower or Paludal Caves<br />
17-25(26) Paludal Caves (much is light blue, but the xp is still worth it)<br />
20-35(40) HKH<br />
<br />
After that, I haven't found a fast place to level up. Go for zones with xp bonuses and you'll level a lot faster than outside, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zeotti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also it would be great for some additions to the other level ranges :) .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">only  problem with frogs is, the fact that 99 billon people are there now. Wizzys, bards, fellow druids , necros even mages agro kite them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
SS is real cheap to cast.<br />
<br />
Why not have it on both, then.<br />
<br />
Speeds the &quot;beat each other down&quot; thing a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gungardian Teleri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I can solo the whole ravenous stalker camp without problems. Sometimes if I do it fast I can take some random spawns around as well, while waiting on stalkers to pop again. Best thing is that I stay almost at FM all the time.</div></div><hr />

Anymore details on this place?  I am 33 with 200+ wisdom.  Is this doable or should I wait a little bit?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ashikita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with Opivvy about not using Savage spirit on PoS frogs as it's easier to control their hp without SS.  Best practice is to keep them both down to around 6%, then you can nuke them both down in one shot.  Also, keeping SS on both means you need to charm and recharm...., not practical.  There're only so many frogs anyway, you can kill them all in 15 min and sit there forever.  Well, unless you kill trees or bears which is pretty sad exp, or killing the giants which is too much work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lyliani Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">too bad the stalkers area ALWAYS camped on MT. :(  <br />

<br />
1-10 In Misty Thicket <br />
11-24 in a combo of Paludral Caverns and Loio<br />

35-45 in Crystal Caverns kiting orcs/pretty much anything<br />
45-54 IN THE HOLE. I haven't found better exp yet. Grab a high level monk and go fer. And if you can't find a decent group go and quad Wyverns in Cobalt Scar.<br />
<br />
54-60 I did in seb and velks back in the day when that WAS the place to level. I beleive i dinged 60 in PoN though.<br />
<br />
61-65 pretty much anywhere in the planes kiting/grouping/quadding.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kanus Silverleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well Here is what I did. When I Started Kanus, I soloed, with no PL'ing at all, him from 1 - 55 in 1 month &amp; that was with me getting my Epic during this time also. Then from 55 to 60 in 2 &amp; a half weeks, could have been faster had I found the spot I hit 60 at faster. :)  <br />
<br />
1-12 (I think it was 12)  Misty Thicket<br />
<br />
12 - 15 Oasis<br />
<br />
15 - 19 EK Killing Gnoll Reavers on the Reaver Hill. If you have done your Char right you should still be able to toe-to-toe these with Damage shield on.<br />
<br />
19 - 22 Paludal Caverns<br />
<br />
22 - 42 Dawnshroud Peaks. Start out pulling the 3 Mushrooms to the Right of the entrance of Sanctus Seru, &amp; Pulling a Small or Regular Zelnik. Quad Kite those till they light blue, then Move up the Trail back tward Neth Lair. About half way between Sanctus &amp; Neth you will run into alot of Regular &amp; large Zelniaks. Quad those till the Large Zelniaks turn Light blue.<br />
<br />
42 - 52 or 53 Quad Spirocs in Timorous Deep.<br />
<br />
53 - 58 Quad Raptors in Timorous Deep.<br />
<br />
58 - 60 Quad Coldian Expidition Guards in Great Divide. They are in the Mining Caves past the Giant Fort there Along the wall. If you have the mana you can try these guys at 55. There is a Trick to them though. Camo up &amp; run down into the mines. There were will be 2 Guards at the bottom of the entrance just run past those for now. To the left there will be a room with Coldain Miners. Do not mess with those. Just follow the path to the back. You will pass a path to the right, Then another small room with 1 Guard &amp; some miners in it on the left, Skip those. Ok Now you should come to a BIG Room with like 5 Miners, 1 Named Miner Dude, a Named Quard, &amp; 3 Guards. Ok the entrance to the room where you come in at should have 2 Normal Coldain Expidition Guards. Ok Attack one of the guards by the tunnel that you came in &amp; it should pull the other. Now as you get back to the front of the Tunnel where you past the First 2 Guards on your way in, Stop &amp; look behind you to make sure the 2 you pulled are still there. Pathing is Screwy here &amp; You have to keep them on if not you will lose them &amp; have to Evac or zone to straiten it out. Now once you see the first 2 you pulled come, run up to the other 2 &amp; just keep running back to the entrance. At the entrance stop &amp; make sure they are coming. Once you see them RUN! Start Snaring them &amp; you will have Plenty of kiting room out side. These guys hit hard &amp; can take you down FAST if you are not carefull. Just learn the path &amp; learn how to pull them &amp; you will love it. I made 4% Per Quad at 58 &amp; 2% per quad at 59 off them. I did this before PoP Came out. It took me longer to get from 53 - 58 than from 58 - 60. Took me a week &amp; 1 day to get to 58 from 53 &amp; only 2 days to hit 60. Then in 3 days I had Innate Runspeed 3, &amp; Innate Metabolism 3 off the guards. <br />
<br />
60 - 65 Hit the Planes.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you guys. Your Lucky though, I have NEVER told anyone outside my guild about DSP &amp; the Guards in GD. Have fun &amp; Happy Quading :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are these guys on Coldain faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kanus Silverleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes they are on Coldain Faction. So for some they may not be an option unless you want to kill Giants afterwards to work on your faction again. Plus The Head Drops are pretty good &amp; you can make good cash selling them, well could anyway. :)</div></div><hr />
