<br />
Yeah, it's definately a monk item.   The problem with it is that's it's a raid item (the zone, not the encounter).  The mpg trial girdle one requires 6 people but the majority of these people need to be very well equipped/AA'd. So, if you have some high level friends, you might be able to tag along and hope it drops and no casters need a +8 mana +5hp clicky.<br />
<br />
 Talisman of the Burrower is definately doable with less than 6 people with  non-raid gear and a lot easier to hunt than the Phylactery quest.  Probably not even a lot of people know it exists or how to check it these days.</div></div><hr />

I did it with 5, with my alt BL tanking (less than 10k unbuffed) . Group was 1 tacvi level rogue, me, gogbuk,  2.0 monk, 2.0 shammy. It wasnt a cakewalk, but it wasnt luck either. <br />
Get yourself a good tank, preferably a pally. Keep skin of the reptile on him the whole fight and you should be golden. You can park 1 or 2 of the adds each wave as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beatslayer</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there's 2 kinds of mana regen clickes<br />
<br />
1. straight mana regen (sometimes has hp regen as well)<br />
<br />
2. hp runes (sometimes has mana regen as well)<br />
<br />
You can get one of each and stack them.<br />
<br />
type 1 are like maelins methodical mind, aura of eternity etc<br />
<br />
type 2 are like shield of dreams, chromatic purity etc.<br />
<br />
To get a complete list of either type. look up the spells listed above in lucy, then look at the bottom of the page for &quot;items with this effect&quot;.   Once you have that, click on the stacking link.  The spells listed there will not stack with the one you recently looked up and likely have similar effects.  Click on those to find out again which items have such an effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chromatic Purity is in the beastlord mana regen line.<br />
Shield of Dreams and Shield of Auras are in the same line as Bristlebane wine (and also don't stack with Geomantra).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To clarify some things...<br />
 <br />
There are 3 lines of clicky mana regen buffs.<br />
 <br />
*Slot 8: Maelin's Methodical Mind line, etc<br />
Druid usable items with line of effect: Many<br />
 <br />
*Slot 5: Beast buff line. <br />
Druid usable items with line of effect:<br />
Scornful's Chromatic Talisman (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=30390)<br />
Shadowed Storm Sphere (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26601)<br />
 <br />
*Slot 9: Jester wine line.<br />
Druid usable items with line of effect:<br />
Brazier of Endless Flame (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47241)<br />
 <br />
However, the only druid usable slot 5 and slot 9 clicky items share a slot 1 rune, so they will not stack. But the slot 5 clicky items will stack with jester wine and brazier clicky will stack with SA.<br />
 <br />
---<br />
 <br />
Not really a clicky item since it's a potion, but shaman made mana regen potions (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2849&amp;source=Live) has slot 7 mana regen, aka mind wrack line.<br />
 <br />
edit:<br />
 <br />
Only problem with the irestone, is that it is much better suited towards a hybrid.<br />
 <br />
All slot 8 hybrid usable mana clickies have a hp regen componet that doesn't stack with clickie overhaste, so this statement depends on the hybrid's gear.</div></div><hr />

I would say that a well rounded hybrid would have both clicks for every situation.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
True, but it's still 'better suited' towards casters in the overall sense, imo.  The only exceptions may be pallies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but it's still 'better suited' towards casters in the overall sense, imo.  The only exceptions may be pallies.<br />
And beastlords and rangers.<br />
<br />
If a hybrid is ever going to be grouped with a bard, then these clickies are exceptional.<br />
<br />
edit: And I don't really see how it is 'better suited' towards casters when there are so many 'better suited' (and more readily availible) mana clickies around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zangal</div><div class="date">05-31-2006, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use celestial cloak (5/5) with Shadowed Storm Sphere (3/3) for a base of FT31.<br />
<br />
SSS won't stack with kitty krack or runes, so I don't apply it during raids, but is great for soloing or groups without beast's.<br />
<br />
Drawback is that it's a cheap rune with a great side effect, 1 or 2 hits and its gone, even from green trash.</div></div><hr />
