<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grenthor</div><div class="date">07-07-2005, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A very strange thing happened to me the other night I did put a post in the Bugs section of the WoW forums but I really doubt anything will actually be done about it.<br />
<br />
Anyway let me explain what happened this is on a PvP server.  <br />
<br />
I was in a Contested Area (Booty Bay) but being a town with guard is you attack players the guards become aggressive towards you which is fair enough.<br />
<br />
Well as i was standing at the Mailbox sorting out something a Rogue Ambushed me which I have no problem with all is fair in love and war.  Immediately the guards agro the rogue like they should so the rogue uses their Vanish skill.  Fine rogue is stealthed and out of combat and all the NPC guards return to home points.  <br />
<br />
It's at this stage being low on health from a 1200+ Ambush that I decide to throw a heal on myself (I do not have the crossed swords indicating I am in a fight).   The minute I cast this spell all the guards immediately agro me and the rogue then uses this as an obvious point to get a nice free GANK because I am getting hit six ways from Sunday.<br />
<br />
This was repeated by this same rogue twice so I know its not a fluke or lag it's a bug apparently in that even after the Rogue has effectively 'Left' Combat and you are not in combat a heal puts you up as if you are and guards attack.<br />
<br />
My point is this if a heal is considered combat then:<br />
<br />
1/  Why aren't we getting Contribution points for it?<br />
<br />
2/  Why are the guards considering that you are in combat even though you do not have the Crossed Swords to Indicate it.  I understand this could be serverside lag but thats really stupid if the rogues can exploit this.<br />
<br />
3/  This seems a very nasty and cheap way for rogues to actually get easy kills:<br />
<br />
     a/   Ambush, Vanish, Preparation, Wait for Heal<br />
     b/   After heal wait for guards to attack<br />
     c/   Ambush, Vanish for the kill<br />
<br />
I am curious if anyone else has had an experience like this? To me this is very much like a Shaman using Frost Shock on a druid in WSG knowing full well they can't shift out of it.  This rogue knew exactly what would happen and was waiting for it which tells me they have done it before.<br />
<br />
Another thing was that he also knew an area where the guards could not attack him and he was effectively out of LOS and unable to be hit by AOE.<br />
<br />
To explain the location if you know BootyBay just up the ramp from the bank on the right near the Inn there is a series of boxes and Barrels on the Wall.  Right at the top of that ramp if you jump over the single barrel and stand behind it you can't be hit by any means.  Trust me this rogue used this too when I managed to recover and start ganking him.  Being unable to him here was a major pain.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrax</div><div class="date">07-07-2005, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are TONS of pvp bugs.  When I played my warlock, I have gotten flagged for pvp while buying melon juice if my succubus invis'd herself or my imp phase shifted.  As a druid, I have gotten killed in ratchet by the guard because I healed someone after a duel.  They were NOT fighting at the time.  I simply healed them after the duel was over.<br />
<br />
I hope they do something to fix this, but then again, I wish they would allow healing to generate contribution points.  It is always skewed against the support classes.</div></div><hr />

At least, it was working that way at one point.<br />
<br />
I've even been guard agrod by buffing another player who wasn't in combat.<br />
<br />
You should post your findings on the WoW bug forum.</div></div><hr />

You go to heal yourself and you think you are out of combat but poof you get attacked by the guards.   Additionally like Bovus I too have been guard agg'd by buffing another player who I don't think was in combat.    Very strange indeed.</div></div><hr />

On the non-pvp server I have been guard agroed from healing myself or casting thorns on myself.  I got one the other night from drinking a potion in town.</div></div><hr />
