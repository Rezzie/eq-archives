Do people not read?  I am worth no honor points for a short period of time when I first land!  HELLO!  How many times do you gotta see that big fat 0 next to honor when you kill someone who's just landed to understand why your still a Scout level PvPer with no points?  I am starting to wonder if the WoW forums are even looked at anymore.  It was pretty sand.<br />
<br />
On a lighter note, there was a massive raid level pvp in Hillsbrad/Tarren Mill.  Larger than normal thanks to honor system.  Quite crappy if you ask me, felt bad the lower levels, they couldn't quest there anymore, and some people on the 60's fighting were booted because the lag was too much.</div></div><hr />
