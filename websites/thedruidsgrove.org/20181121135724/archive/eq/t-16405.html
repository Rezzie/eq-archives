Personally ive spent a lot of time charming Worgs in Loping plains. There is alot of them (like 50) so your never going to run out of things to kill. If you treat them like the Mammoths in Icefall its pretty good exp. <br />
<br />
Charm one, set it on another one, pull another so now 2 mobs are killing your pet, break invis on 10% or less, cast NBW and Storm Strike. Let mob die, charm another and repeat.<br />
<br />
I get about a yellow exp an hour at lvl 77, although I think it will drop off the closer I get to 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ive tried it with numbers like this but I find its very hard to break charm when one is low health and sometimes my pet gets killed which is wasted exp.<br />
<br />
Also I find that if you take a few of the mobs down to low health, they start to ignore each other and just chase me instead of killing their friends.<br />
<br />
The great shame with Loping Plains Worgs is that there is a second batch of higher level ones (vicious?) which seem to be 1level too high for our charm. If we could have charmed them I think the exp would have been even greater, but cant have everything.<br />
<br />
Vekx, the Worgs are kind of near the Bloodmoon zone, they are actually marked on the map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it difficult to time charm breaks with too many mobs at once.  I end up having to break charm at a higher level of health to prevent my pet from dying while charmed.  Instead, my preferred method is to pull two worgs and root one (#1).  #1 never gets charmed.  Then I charm #2, have it attack the rooted one, and run off to pull a third worg (which may be far away if most of the worgs are dead already).  The worgs are social, so when I pull worg #3 over fighting worgs #1 and #2, #3 attacks #2 giving me an easy chance to debuff it.  When #2 gets low on health, I break charm and charm #3 and have it kill #2 then attack #1.  I immediately run off to pull another worg and repeat.<br />
<br />
A few of the vicious worgs are one level too high to be charmed, but some of them are not.<br />
<br />
Entrap level 2 is fantastic and should be a high priority for anyone charming.  I like Storm Strike for pulling too due to its extremely short cast time.</div></div><hr />

I use the same technique on the gators.  The nice thing about them is that they are all level 78 so they can all be charmed.<br />

QFT.  I've been using this for pulling the gators and I've only had 3 resists over the course of about 50aas worth of gators.  <br />
<br />
BTW, if you're doing the gators, be sure to get the task that involves collecting Mounds of Clay that Ryveron  (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=27059)gives.</div></div><hr />

 1) don't damage the mobs at all until the very end.  This keeps aggro on your pet.  An ideal pull would be 6 mobs knocking each other down until 5 are almost dead; you then unleash your pet on them in order and tap each with one damage spell.<br />
2) Have a cycle NPC hotbutton to find the one with highest health<br />
3) If you get mob aggro on you, run around them in a tight circle until your pet gets low health aggro<br />
<br />
Dropping the pet health from 100 to 5% goes 5x faster with 6 than with 1.<br />
Worgs in loping plains go snaredead at low health.  With this setup I also run indefinitely with almost full mana; I can actually afford to use NBW to speed the process at the end.  Oh, and reaping inferno works beautifully with this setup...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I was under the impression that if you kill a mob while having a charmed pet, then the pet would leech some of your exp.  I tend to get them all to low health and finish them off when i am petless.<br />
 <br />
One thing i have noticed is the lag in Loping planes (appart from getting me killed a lot while kiting) makes it hard to click invis when pet is low health.  Seems the take some time to catch up with all the damage....</div></div><hr />

Nercos, Wizards and such have a very hard time kiteing there.  Everything is KOS to them... Animals roam all over.<br />

There is one spell wich I find invaluable while charming wich did not make your list and that is: Summon Companion. Often druids forget about this spell and don't realize how powerfull it really is. Summon Companion is call of the hero for your charm pet with a fairly decent cast time. No waiting for your snared pet to catch up to you, simply tell him to sit. Get near mob you wish to kill coth pet and let him attack. This spell really helps minimize damage sustained on charm breaks as well. Or perhaps simply send your pet in to get beat on and get a good distance away and coth pet when low health for a finishing blow with reaping inferno. Rinse Repeat for decent experience.</div></div><hr />

It is clickable from inventory. Savage spirit doesn't even mob's damage totally, but I throw on a few dots with a nuke or 2 and always manage to get them under 10% health together.<br />
 <br />
I use my trusty Sand Eroded Shell (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19284) to even out damage between the charmed and non-charmed mobs. Be careful though... if charm breaks and the pet gets to you it's gonna rip you a few new ones. Snare is extra important, heh. If charm doesn't break until my pet is almost dead I click off savage spirit before I invis, just to be safe.</div></div><hr />

Well, I tried it too, and things were fine. Mobs in the lower kiting area did not summon, but I wanted to be clever and pulled one of the 2 guards near the door to the tower - it summoned, stunned me, &quot;Loading Please wait&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is nice about the zone is that it is always empty, the mobs do not resist snare or root at all, even at 76 and the exp is good (not great because it takes ages to kill them). It is easy to reach too: Port to LP, egress, run over to the other zoneside, turn left, catapult to Mech FOrt, then use the catapult to Zeta - takes about 3 minutes from anywhere.<br />

I honestly can't tell if Glamour makes any difference at all with Worgs in LP. I'd say 10-20% of the time, charm will break before the spell gem recycles. Charm will last 1 minute or so way less than 50% of the time (maybe 10-20% again) regardless of whether Glamour is used.<br />
<br />
An upgraded version of Glamour, something with more than a 20 MR debuff, would be nice as AA or spell.</div></div><hr />

The Vinelash Cascade part was very risky.  Often one root broke before I could entrap them all, and without snare they could outrun me.<br />
