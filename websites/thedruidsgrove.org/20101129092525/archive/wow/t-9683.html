I was just curious why the need to socket items, I mean clearly I know what it does but we already have enchanting, isn't socketing and enchanting a bit of an overkill?  Or am I missing something?<br />

<br />
Also it let's you customize an item to your tastes... given how many threads I've seen on the WoW boards complaining about Item X having Stat Y... this is somthing people want.<br />
<br />
I disagree with Yrys... as with everything else raiders will be getting the best of the best.  I would think either via powerful gemcraft plans (ohh.. what are the plans gonna be called? cutting diagrams?) or epic items with more open slots to fill.</div></div><hr />

BG PvP needs a major overhaul if they want to keep attracting new players.  They can't keep making new servers every few weeks forever.  Starting on a new server is the only way someone can have any chance of a level playing field.</div></div><hr />

<br />
funny they said the same thing when the game was originally released, which was about 30 servers ago =)<br />
<br />
Actually I have no idea how many servers were added since release but it is probably some sickening number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">12-12-2005, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's at least two times the number of servers available today in North America since the game went live.  Wouldn't surprise me if it was 3x.<br />
<br />
That said, the compelling issue within the game now is character advancement.  Once you hit 60, it's solely Gear.  You have two ways to gear up - PvP (requires a lot of time each week) or Raiding.  20 man ZG was welcome for people in smaller guilds.  Based on my limited play on the test server, 20 man AQ is significantly more difficult.<br />
<br />
They are putting more gear in the game which you can earn from missions (quests) in Silithus.  That's going to help a lot.  The expansion will help more, but that is something like 6-12 months away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">12-12-2005, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think the only reason people keep playing is the ease with which an alt or twink is created and leveled these days. People that have been 60 for months likely have multiple level 60 characters and are gearing all of them up too.<br />
<br />
I really have no idea what justifies the server indicators they put up, like new/low/medium/high/full. My server was medium a month ago and now its full and server queues have started. Are there really that many people joining the game that steadily or are people just making characters on a bunch of different servers? Or is every character created counted towards the population count and are those characters when deleted removed from the count? Those gold sellers like &quot;Asadkjdsd&quot; sending me tells and then likely disappearing from the server come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">12-13-2005, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The population levels are crazy. We always have queues and the population indicaters just say medium. Insane. But its fine, I always forget some last minute things after I log in, so waiting a few minutes gives me time to grab a soda, have a smoke, or grab my slippers.<br />
<br />
As for socketing I see it as a way for players to customize their equipment for themselves. Somepeople have nice purple caster gear with nice stats and +spell/healing, but could use some dodge for when the grab aggro. Others would take the same thing and say, well, my healing is good, and I never get aggro, so I could use extra spell damage for when I have to play that role in a pinch. Still a warlock with the same thing might want extra sta for their lifetaps. <br />
<br />
Its also possible the jewels will add modifyers that aren't common, like +run speed or something. Oooh maybe they will have perfect topaz for +Magic Find. Help bump that green drop into a blue. Lol<br />

Some other things they may do with it would be stuff like increasing the max durability on a wep?... sound good to anyone?.. lol didn't think so, i don't know blizzard has proved to be un predictable when it comes to where there taking the game, so all I can say is, i can't wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">12-26-2005, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess socketing if for more stats.  Makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
I came to the game about 9 months after it came out and never thought anything of the 'twinks' in the battlegrounds.  Always have won and come in 1st or 2nd with first character.  <br />
<br />
Really alot of people who play this game go at it with 'I am going to hit you with my big expensive weapons' and not actual gaming skill.  (WoW is a really easy game when it comes down to it).</div></div><hr />

It's an ok idea if you just want to own all the time, but I would rather try to improve my skills so that I can actually kill people levels above me - not below.</div></div><hr />

I was in WSG last week on Illidan. There was this Dwarf Pally with a Crusader enchant. Yeah it was the 10-19 BG's too. It was just sick. Seriously.<br />
