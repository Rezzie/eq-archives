It's a little bear that attacks a mob for you... It's set on a timer so the bear will only whack the mob momentarily, then poof.... As you go up in rank, the longer Boo Boo hits the mob...</div></div><hr />

I cannot remember what every level of AA increases the damage by but the first level allows the bear to stay for 30 secs, 2nd 45 secs, 3rd 1 min, then every level after that raises attack power ... I think last level gives close to 800 max per hit for 1 min<br />
 <br />
Edit<br />
The recast time of this is about 21-22 min and you can have it attack one mob unless u get another mob to hit u b4 the bear goes away, another note is that one hit to the bear makes it go away .... so if u hoping for it tank for u no luck there and be careful using in raids where the mobs do Wild Rampages</div></div><hr />

When the aa is maxed the bear will hit for over 700. Over the course of a short battle it will add about 100 dps give or take.</div></div><hr />
