<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gneaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my laptop when trying to go to www.magelo.com I now get the prompt for a file download.<br />
<br />
<br />
File name: magelo<br />
File type:<br />
from:          www.magelo.com<br />
<br />

Only pages from magelo have been giving me this problem. The laptop runs W2k. This is happening on both the work and home network.  I've messed around with proxy settings, checked registry for &quot;magelo&quot;, all sorts of little things to see if I could spot something. IE6 was reinstalled. I don't recall installing anything right before I noticed this problem, but the IT people could have pushed something down.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well no idea why you would be getting that I just tried the magelo site (from your link) and works fine.<br />
<br />
Its something to do with your settings in IE most likely or a firewall.  <br />
<br />
I know at home i have to autorise java on my firewall inorder to get it to work.<br />
<br />
This is a direct link to their forums....maybe that will work and you can have a look around for some help there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tiniane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just in case you can't get through to the link Tils posted, here are the settings for accessing Magelo with IE6 (copied from http://www.magelo.com/forum_flat.html?mess_num=29839 ):<br />
<br />
Internet Explorer 6 <br />
<br />
There are few things you need to check with IE 6... in no particular order: <br />
<br />
- Make sure you keep up with the latest IE 6 with critical updates from Microsoft (Tools -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Scan for updates). Make it a habit to check this at least once a week for maximum compatibility. <br />
<br />
- Make sure Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Use HTTP1.1 through proxy connections is checked ON (ie. checkmarked). Use HTTP should also be ON. <br />
<br />
- You should have your Security and Privacy levels set to medium. If it's higher or custom, make sure you know exactly what are the consequences (trying to set back to medium is a good idea to be sure it doesn't come from here). Medium high should be acceptable. Magelo does use a cookie to automatically log you in whenever you visit. <br />
<br />
- If you are using something like Norton Internet Security or Zone Alarm (its privacy settings), make sure you configure it properly to work with Magelo (see Zone Alarm or Norton HOWTOs in the library). <br />
<br />
- Clear your browser cache when you suspect IE is messing up (eg. displaying an old page or an empty dropdown list). Here's how: Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Delete Files. <br />
<br />
- To keep IE's cache manager from outsmarting itself, set Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Settings -&gt; Every visit to the page. This will go a long way towards allowing you to see the web content you've selected all the time, and not something else. <br />
<br />
- Finally, make sure you don't disable Javascript in the Advanced section of Tools -&gt; Internet Options. (hmm, where is it?) <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
<br />
Hugs,<br />
Tiniane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what fixed it. I *know* I had this set this way before. Either IT pushed something that changed it or I fixed something and this was reset while I was fiddling with something else.<br />
<br />
I think I was delving too deep into the problem and should have confirmed the basic stuff first. This is doubly bad for me because this is exactly what I preach to my coworkers when we do troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Whatever it was, thank you for the help. Much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Onetree Tallbarque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I authored much of that IE Settings post. Actually, if a browser is prompting you for a file download that means it doesn't know what to do with a particular web entity's mime-type and your policy for handling such exceptions is to prompt the user. Magelo gzips its web pages to improve throughput and reduce operating costs. gzip is a fancy way of saying 'compressed'.<br />
<br />
The real solution is to go to Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Advanced tab, scroll down a bit, then make sure there's a checkmark next to the 'Use HTTP  1.1 through proxy connections' item. Click OK and you're ready to browse Magelo. :)</div></div><hr />
