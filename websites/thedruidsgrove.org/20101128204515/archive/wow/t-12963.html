<br />
I need some help to spec for tanking:<br />
<br />
1) Could you link some good tanking talent spec's?<br />
<br />
2) Is Predatory Instincts only for Cat?<br />
<br />
3) Is Infected Wounds only for Cat?<br />
<br />
4) Is Rend and Tear only for Cat?<br />
<br />
5) Is King of the jungle worth taking? and why?<br />
<br />
Sorry for all the questions, I've been a tank for over 2yrs and I raid a lot. I would like to be the best spec tank and also do at least good dps in cat to farm.<br />
<br />
Can you help me!<br />
Thanks<br />

You have been tank for 2 years and dont have a clue on how about the new talents work?? Where you afk-off-tank or something? :banghead: <br />
<br />
But ok... here goes:<br />
1) my built (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGGsfbzMeRcczAo0x)<br />
<br />
2) Pred. Instincts is for cats. AOE-damage-reduction also for bears if im right<br />
<br />
3) Infected wounds is more important for tanking than cat.<br />
20% slow of boss-attacks =  ~ -20% damage income<br />
<br />
4) Rend &amp; Tear. Awesome for cat dps. Awesome for bear-TPS.<br />
Its a must-have.<br />
<br />
5) King of the jungle is more a PvP talent in my opinion. Or a Cat-DPS-Only built. Cause it boosts burst DPS.<br />
But no room in a tanking built.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was never sure about your 2) above S3R that bear did still benefit from the AOE reduction ?<br />
<br />
i'll put more into Rend as i level.<br />
<br />
and as i level i'm going to have to decide on the merits of the 2 shapeshifter talents....</div></div><hr />

<br />
At present rage is not a problem and I'm mostly in bear form.<br />
<br />
Infected wounds (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48483) is the next thing for me as I hit 71, and then Natural (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=16835) + Master Shapeshifter (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48412) + Omen of Clarity (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=16864).<br />
<br />
At present that spec is able to tank anything, am loving the changes to swipe and growl :icon_lol:<br />
