I created this thread so that druids can share their PvP tactics when fighting in BGs. So anyone who thinks they have a good tactic for fighting in PvP as a druid post it here.<br />
<br />
<br />
And heres one from myself:<br />
If you are just trying to get HKs, then get in cheetah form and run around just trying to hit as many guys as possible, you dont have to kill them, just get a hit on them. Once the guy gets killed, you will get an HK for doing it and the honor as well. Remeber this is only good for doing it if you are trying to get HKs, if you are trying to actually help this is not a good tactic at all. Note* it also sometimes makes the people you are fighting with mad, so just be careful.:elfbiggri</div></div><hr />

Starfire works better if you're focusing damage.<br />

Druids are strong on that. Save your cat sprint for flag attempts. And turn NS on before you get the flag. Sometimes if you cast the NS after you wont have time to click the heal....<br />
<br />
AB: I find myself healing a lot and ninja stealing points.<br />
<br />
AV: I AOE a lot in AV, a well placed tranquility can give your group that edge to win a point and so does a Hurricane. Other then that i am either healing people or running from AF.<br />

<br />
AB is random, with a good group I'll hold a point and heal.  If it's not a group and it's a free for all I just try to keep the horde from getting organized.<br />
<br />
AV I think I can count on one hand the number of times I have cast Tranquility.  94 hp every 2 sec for 10 sec just isn't enough when taking on the warmasters.  <br />
<br />
Now when keeping horde from capturing a flag, then hurricane is great as with each damage taken it interrupts their attempt on the flag.  <br />
<br />
I usually am in feral form and feral gear until we get to the relief hut at which point I go caster and healing gear to keep the MTs alive.  I did tank the general once and I have to admit that was crazy fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">04-18-2006, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tanked Vanndar Stormpike from start to finish last night and....wow he hits insanely hard. Strangely enough I managed to maintain aggro throughout the entire fight without it flopping around like it normally does when a warrior tanks him. Tanked all the marshalls....well I guess if you call tanking getting wtfpwned by 3 on occasion and rezzing back in to continue tanking zerg style then ya I did that =)<br />
<br />
Seeing my rage bar at 100% nearly the entire fight....was pure insanity, first time I have ever seen the red bar full lol. Think its time to hang it up after tanking him because that was by far the most fun moment I have had in AV thus far. Managed to snag exalted last night so I am never going back into there except to fill time between AB/WSG =)<br />
<br />
ps. I have used Hurricane on occasion to bomb a flag in AV, but I don't think Tranquility is even on any of my hotbars lol.</div></div><hr />

Frost mage is fine but when some MS build warrior decked out in epics charges at them and 2 shots them, I will take the druid mainly because we can run faster than a mage and shift out of any movement impairing debuff. Runners are usually only as good as the team that supports them, so a druid will get destroyed equally as fast as anyone else trying to escape a fr with no support and 4-5 opposing players killing him/her.</div></div><hr />

Wow.  Off the top of my head if I could just throw out one thing that made people love me in a dire situation in a raid instance, it was a well placed barkskin/tranquility.   And I am feral.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it'd work for the entire raid, or whoever is in the area (someone PLEASE correct me if that is not so).  Besides, most of the time I'm randomly grouped  where my group members may or may not be anywhere nearby :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not trying to be an ass here Wulf but we were talking about PvP not a raid instance. It's very rare, if ever that the entire group you are in during an AV is all going to be within range to make a Tranquility worthwhile in the first place. <br />
<br />
I am sure there are instances in which Tranquility is nice and actually effective, but I have not seen it yet because I am in BG's whenever I am online, hence why the spell is not on my hotbar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">04-18-2006, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is true.  It only works on your group members.  I spend some time in BG's, but more time in dungeons.  Not having tranquility on my toolbar would be like hunter not using traps.  Watching the priests mana closely and seeing the entire group falling in health, you call forth an area heal.  I suggest casting barkskin first of course. You will be loved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention that the tank-runner-druid has popped into bearform when he noticed the badass warrior coming at him, so the badass warriors mighty asscandy sword now feels like thai-massage on the tank-runner-druid. Tank-runner-druids friends has time to come meet him if necessery.<br />
<br />
The Frost mage? erhm.. well the badass warrior killed him on the way to the druid runner. Sorry Frost mage. No armor makes badass warriors mighty asscandy hurt your squishy body, badly. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woolybully</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WSG - pretty straightforward.  Flag runner, decoy or slowing down the opposition with feral charges and roots.  Great at flag running.<br />
<br />
AB - depends on your group really.  Good at attacking or defending.  And a druid is able to get around pretty quickly using there forms.<br />
<br />
AV - As a feral druid it sucks.  In cat form I have to wait for stragglers and people sitting down to drink.  And usually there are 5-10 people around ready to jump all over me after I get a kill.  In bear form a druid can make a pretty decent tank when your trying to push back the opposition at a graveyard flag.  Just the mere presence of warriors and druids in bear form seems to push the masses back although your going to take a beating and most likely die unless you have some healing.  Great at kiting guards and defending graveyards.</div></div><hr />
