<br />
I've recently dinged 70 and am in the process of gathering some resto gear for Kara. Right now I'm at 850 plus healing. My guild pretty much has Kara on farm, so I'm guessing that I might be ok. Do you guys think I am at the point where I should ask if I can go? I don't want to be the person who isn't ready and mooches off other well-geared toons I guess is what I'm worried about.<br />
<br />
Also, what kind of build should I respect to? I've looked at some on wowwiki and have some ideas. I know that I want to be good in arena and also raiding. Those will be the only things I'll do. I'm trying to figure out how tree of life also fits into that. Can anyone suggest a build? <br />
<br />
Thank you all for your help!</div></div><hr />

After a run or two you'll start to carry your own weight, providing you get some gearage.  Make sure you get it properly enchanted and gemmed!<br />
<br />
As far as a spec is concerned... if you want to go through Kara and truly not pull your weight, go for a hybrid pvp spec.  If you want to contribute, then go for Tree of Life.   I wish I could tell you there was a middle ground that is perfectly fine, but there isn't.   I put 42 points into Resto and the rest in Balance.  But there's a pvp talent in Resto and Nature's Grasp in Balance is nice for pvp.<br />
<br />
I still play arenas but we're not serious pvp'ers and our score isn't great. This game requires most classes to pick what they're going to excel at, pvp or pve.  Kind of blows you can't really do both, without dropping a ton of money into respecing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
get 5/5 NG and 3/3 the talent that reduces root and cyclone time in balance, pick up feral talents up to Feral charge, then fill in Resto with all talents that increase HoT healing.  <br />
<br />
You'll be fine in Kara if they already have it on farm.  Don't expect to top the healing meters or anythig, but you'll be ok to just sit in Tree and spam LB on random raid members, while the main healer focuses on the tank.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to ask a follow-up question though. The last poster said I could sit in tree form with the 8/11/42 build. I checked that build on wowwiki and it appears that you don't get to the treeform talent with that build. Am I missing something? Or was there just a different one point variation in the resto tree somewhere?</div></div><hr />

*edit:  I'd link a talent calculator, but I'm at work and they are all blocked.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to be good in arena and serviceable for raid healing and be able to heal heroic instances too. Right now I don't have a guild, but that's beside the point!<br />

Edit: Is not taking Living Spirit going to hurt me? How bad is it to skip that talent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
keep in mind that, from experience, some fights are simply not suited for a druid's way of healing (HoT!), so you shouldn't be demoralized. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoTs with Swiftmend and Nature's Swiftness are AWESOME for boss healing in Karazhan ... it's just that your HoTs have to hit hard enough.<br />
<br />
That's why people recommend 1000 bonus healing before ToL and other bonus healing-affecting talents.</div></div><hr />
