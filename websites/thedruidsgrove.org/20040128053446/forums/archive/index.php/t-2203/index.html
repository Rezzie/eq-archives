<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kobara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have spent the last 3 days doing nothing but killing in Nadox for the parts required to combine my new Pure Blood spell, but this has been my experience :<br />
<br />
Foraged the Gunthak Gulf Water in Gunthak harbor near the Dulak's zoneline... got the Broken Skull Clan Blood from Furious Blackhands (3 different times)... got the Pure Blood off a Luggald Abomination....<br />
<br />
Only part lacking is the A Blackened Vial... various sites have claimed that this is dropped by Broken Skull Initiates and Abherents, but I am convinced this must be wrong.. I have killed no less than 100 of these mobs over the 3 days and have yet to see the Vial drop. Can anyone who has actually completed the quest or seen a Blackened Vial tell me what dropped it for you? I am starting to see ugly Trolls in my sleep from this experience.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any real information that can help me get past this final hurdle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
did this a week or 2 ago myself, and helped a guildy do this the other night...lets see if i can describe where i got it to drop.<br />
<br />
from the bridge.. oposite side of the lugands(facing the egress spot area)...<br />
<br />
if you run forwards about 30 feet, turn RIGHT, go through that room with approx 15 trolls in it, to the hall on the other side... on the left, about halfway, there is a tunnel leading off..there are some barrels on the right side of the hall you are in...facing forwards, with that tunnel on the left, about another 50 feet forwards, is an area with about 9-11 Innitiates and Abherents, with one funky arse looking pillar in the middle.. there are a few spawns up on ledges... that is the area i got all mine to drop from. if worse comes to worse, send me a tell, i will make a noob on yer server, and guide you, as long as you invis me. i play on Mithanial Marr, so whenever if that doesnt hepl!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Above poster was correct, those mobs do drop the Vial in the location he gave.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yay I get to re-use the picture I made from the other thread:<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://home.interlynx.net/g/graem/nadoxshrines.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border:0;&quot;/&gt;<br />
<br />
Go to the, well, Other shrine (has vials) !<br />
<br />
Ignore &quot;Shrine he's talking about&quot;, that was from the other thread hehe.<br />
<br />
Tia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ianwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">woot! nice pic.... thought i was gonna have to go take a buttload of SS and post em to be nice, but i dun gotta now ;) <br />
<br />
thankies fer the assistance to assist..er..yea.. somethin like that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kobara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the inputs.. I have been sitting in that dead end room to the left in your picture and pulling the 1 Initiate, 1 Adherent at the doorway and the 1 Furious Blackhand that roams in the hall... since I am soloing, and my one try at pulling from inside the shrine there resulted in chain-agro of 5 or 6 NPCs, I stopped trying to pull from the shrine room itself.<br />
<br />
Guess I will continue trying and hope that eventually the easily pulled Broken Skulls in the hallway will drop my Vial... thanks again. At least there is confirmation I am in the right area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bremen7</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe, Im the &quot;he' Tiane is referring to from the other thread. <br />
<br />
Anyway, hang in there Kobara. That piece was the biggest pain for me. I tried soloing it too but I found that you can't level pull from that little shrine room--and those Adherents are shamen, ugh. <br />
<br />
Get a friend or another Druid or Cleric or Shaman who needs the drop and clear the room. We did that and we all 3 got the damn thing in about a half hour. This was after 2 days worth of soloing painstakingly in that area to no avail. I did find that all 3 of our drops came from Adherents. But both drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kobara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a quick update... i Finally got that Blackened Vial on my third day of trying... I always figured the room spawns might have a greater chance of dropping it than the two doorway guards that could be single pulled to the side-room, but I was stubbornly trying to avoid bringing anyone into Nadox unless they also needed the parts.<br />
<br />
On day 3, found a monk who was already there trying to get the pieces for his alt 48 cleric (thanks again Kelb). We had to evac and rinse a couple times and died once thanks to Adherents channeling gates back into the room (surefire mess is the result if/when that happens) but after about 3 hours, and Initiate dropped it.<br />
<br />
At 63, upon turnin of the final combine item to Grennic, I got 5% regular experience (hear it can be 20-25% AA if you have all exp going into AA). Too bad it flags you clandestinely, and doing ther quest more than once doesnt duplicate the exp draw. <br />
<br />
But I have my Pure Blood at last...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Easiest way to do is to charm an exhausted bloodtusk (need 63 charm), he can own like 3 at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even the CoK-able boars will work, though it can be a bit of a pain to get one to the right area.  The exhausted bloodtusk spawns in such a convenient area...</div></div><hr />
