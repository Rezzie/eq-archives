Hi.  I have never tried balance before and I just speced into it today.  My toon is level 58 at the moment.  For grinding trash mobs in hellfire peninsula what would a normal spell rotations look like?<br />
<br />
Also, is it always advisable to cast out of moonkin form or are there situations when you would want to bomb from regular form?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you are in a group use Moonkin form (aka Lazer Chicken of Doom) and cast most of the time Moonfire and Wrath you can deliver a good amount of DPS in this form also the Moonkin Aura is good for all casters in the group<br />
<br />
Hope this help<br />

<br />
Get the mob at maximum Range (36 meters). Then start with Wrath, a second Wrath, a third Wrath, then Moonfire and then Roots. At that moment the mob will be directly in front of you. Turn around and get a few meters away. Cast Insect Swarm while you do that (can be cast on things behind you).<br />
Now Starfire/Wrath and the mob should be down before he gets free again.<br />
<br />
The third Wrath in above rotation is not a must, it depends on how comfortable you are with the mob you are fighting and how fast. Usually I can get off all 3 Wraths and the Moonfire before the mob is in melee range.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious why you prefer to solo grind in normal form as opposed to moonkin form.  I have heard other people say exactly the same thing but I don't understand what the benefit would be.  Can you explain?<br />
<br />
Also, here is the rotation I worked out while I was waiting for replies to my post here.  Tell me what you think?<br />
<br />
I open with root then go imediately to moonfire and insect swarm so all three DOTs can go ahead and be ticking off damage.  Then while he is still rooted I hit him with a starfire at which time he is usually running for up to me.  I then finish off by spamming wrath till the mob is dead.</div></div><hr />

I hit Moonfire, and then I Wrath it to death.  I might throw another Moonfire in if he has the hps.<br />
<br />
If you are grinding trash mobs, I do suggest speccing Celestial focus.  You will find getting hit causes very little dps decrease.  The possible stun is also nice.<br />
<br />
I don't suggest soloing in hellfire at 58 without moonkin form.  If you're soloing trivial mobs it's a different matter, but the AC bonus along with barkskin will probably help with the repair bills =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suggest:<br />
<br />
Starfire, moonfire, roots, insect swarm, wrath wrath wrath wrath<br />
<br />
Starfire first because for the whole 3 sec the mob isn't even aware you're about to attack.  Then when it hits, the moonfire comes straight away.  The roots comes next, then insect swarm while you're backpeddling away from it.  Then just spam wrath until it dies - it's unlikely to survive more than a couple of wraths.<br />
<br />
I would advise against opening with roots, because direct damage such as Starfire and moonfire (the initial hit) tend to break roots early.  Dots such as insect swarm, and the dot component of moonfire, are much less likely to break it.  With this rotation you would be getting the majority of your direct damage out the way at the start.<br />
I would use wrath at the end, because it casts faster than starfire (and therefore is less vulnerable to spell pushback if the mob actually manages to hit you) and is more mana-efficient than spamming moonfire.<br />

But at 70 with a fair amount of spell damage gear I just Starfire, Starfire, Wrath till mob is dead. It may be less mana efficient than doing the rooting and running rotation, but it sure kills the mob faster. Between Innvervate, my tree buddies and sitting down to drink, I can grind mobs very fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For kara... 700 spell dmg min to start in kara. Boomkins are very dependent on gear for high dps so once her gear gets better so should her dps. Also... make sure she maxes her spell hit w/ gems and enchants<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to mention that I take several mobs at once which is why I also stay out of moonkin to heal myself and conserve mana</div></div><hr />
