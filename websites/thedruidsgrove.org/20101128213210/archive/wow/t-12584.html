<br />
      Just got heavy clefthoof set and Fel leather set and need to gem them. I will be dpsing and off tanking in kara, I also have the styling purple hat, Necklace of the deep,and a warden's hauberk. Just wondering if you can recomend gems to put in. <br />
   Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danimal</div><div class="date">05-02-2008, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I have bought 3 solid star of elune, 4 glinting noble topaz, 3 shifting nightseye, and 2 delicate living ruby (which I am going to put into my &quot;necklace of the deep&quot; (2 slots)  using as both dps and tank neck at moment). I am going to need 5 more gems if these others seem right. There are 8 slots in cleft set and 7 in fel leather. Will prob use fel gloves for both at the moment also. <br />
<br />
  Does this seem about right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
are you uncrittable without needing to socket for defence ?<br />
<br />
is your stamina low or your agi low to decide between these ?<br />
<br />
do you need/want to socket for the socket bonuses ?<br />
<br />
how much +hit have you got ? would you benefit from more ?</div></div><hr />

You should be closer to 18-20k+ I would think to start.</div></div><hr />

If someone could tell me which gems are best to get my defense, armor, dodge up I would appreciate it . here is my profile : http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Mug%27thol&amp;n=Bloodysewati</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">05-06-2008, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok problem #1:  You are mixing and matching sets.  You have DPS AND Tanking items on.  Heavy Clefthoof items are NOT good DPS items and the rest of your gear is pretty much NOT good for Tanking.  Your best bet for finding gear is to go<br />
<br />
http://www.emmerald.net/<br />
<br />
For some gear lists.  It will show you where to get items and what type of items you want.  <br />
<br />
Generally socketing there are two strategies for Tank:<br />
1.  Agility<br />
2.  Stamina<br />
Both have their merits.  Stamina is great in the beginning to keep you alive.  As time progresses Agility is better due to the ability to just plain not get hit.<br />
<br />
Look through the gear lists above and see what type of itemization you should be looking at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing missing from the above link is that now you have access to nearly free PvP gear that can fill in the gaps (like shoulders and gloves).  So, look at the above gear list, and factor in the nearly free items from the Drangonhide Battlegear Set (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=742) and you can have a rock solid kit in 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Combine the gear in the above 2 links with with the enchanting link a couple of messages back and you have a Kara (and low-level heorics like hUB, hSP) ready kit.</div></div><hr />
