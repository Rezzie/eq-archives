<br />
1. Deepest Guk<br />
<br />
2. Mistmoore<br />
<br />
3. Tak Hiz<br />
<br />
4. Rujarkian<br />
<br />
Deepest Guk has the best looking mobs(although MM gives it a run for it's money) and the best dungeon architecture. It has the most 'dungeony' ambience to me: dark, dank, and mysterious.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore's architecture isn't anything real special(although it has some cool rooms/objects) but the mobs are what really make it shine. The mummies, shadows, robed figures, and dust devil thingies get a thumbs up.<br />
<br />
Tak Hiz has a couple cool mob models(phosphorescent golems come to mind, the sand elves also look good) and the architecture isn't bad but it just seems to be missing something. It also has the most old world mob models in it which makes it seem less than original.<br />
<br />
Rujarkian seems kind of uninspired. The new models for some older mobs look good but it's till orcs and goblins. The architecture also leaves something to be desired. Kind of plain and without a lot of atmosphere, it has kind of a boring feel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Than you haven't been in the one with the rope bridges, waterfalls and huts.  Easily the coolest looking area in the new zones I've seen yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">09-13-2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I haven't even seen half the dungeons for any particular theme despite the fact that I was in beta, so I guess my opinion could change, but I'd have a difficult time picking one that was a favorite.  I have different reasons I like all of them.<br />
<br />
I like Rujarkian because it has a lot of casters for me to drain mana from.  The ones I've been in have also been neat because they're more like mazes than the other dungeons.<br />
<br />
Takish`Hiz is neat because it's mainly seperate rooms.  It's a lot more difficult to pull in these dungeons because of the doors.  I really liked the one adventure we did where we had to rescue someone from a tower.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore is great.  I've always loved the undead dungeons (like Unrest and the original Mistmoore).  I really like how some of the mobs are actually sleeping in the coffins.<br />
<br />
I've only been to two of the Guk zones, but I was a little disappointed with them.  They didn't really have the same feel as Guk and were more like Innothule.  Perhaps there are zones that look more like a dungeon, but the two I've been in have looked like underground caves.  Nonetheless, I had a lot of fun in them.<br />
<br />
I've only been to two Miragul's as well, and one was on a raid in beta where I barely got to see anything.  These zones sort of look to me like PoP had a yard sale (which incidentally fits in the with lore), but I haven't seen enough to form an opinion yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been to the Ruj one with rope bridges and such and while they are kind of cool there weren't any objects there that really wowed me.</div></div><hr />

I never felt more usefull than in that dungeon becuase I could put out significant dps with destroy summoned.</div></div><hr />

We explored one the other day with a winding staircase around a giant tree, very cool.   However I think the monster models in Mistmoore are my favorite, the vampires and werewolves are gorgeous.  I love deepest guk too though, watching froggie ghosts slowly flip while casting in midair hehe.<br />
<br />
Things I like the LEAST in LDoN:<br />
<br />
Tornado mobs.  Annoying to target, annoying to try to loot, not very cool looking, and they had to freaking add them to 3 of the 5 themes???  WHY?<br />
<br />
Miragul's is too bright!  I have to turn my gamma to 0 so I don't get a headache :) .  Also Curvy walls that monsters get knocked up are annoying, give me strait walls please ;) .<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping Verant bans all tornado mobs :) ,<br />

<br />
This would be opposite the above ground caves :P<br />
<br />
It is hard to determine a favourite.  The first one I went to was mistmoore.  I was impressed with the atmosphere and the new models.  I particularly liked the shadows.<br />
<br />
I then spent some time in Takish.  It is very interesting, like exploring a buried city.  Oh wait, it is a buried city.  This is the scenario I have the most lore on, though not a lot has been revealed yet.<br />
<br />
I recently went to guk.  Many in the group complained they felt claustraphobic.  I liked it.  The models looked great.<br />
<br />
I haven't been in the orcs or miraguls areas.  What I saw of miragul looked dull, but I may have missed something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I can't decide...<br />
<br />
I've done Miragul's and Mistmoore so far.  I really like them both!  I guess I thought the layout of Miragul's was really nifty and all those Planar models I've never seen before was fun.   I liked the long corridors and the big rooms stuffed with books.  Points off for the goo model.  I hate fighting that model because I have to stand on it to hit it.<br />
<br />
Mistmoore is cool too though.  All those vampires in long capes and gowns, but I didn't like the tunnel part of Mistmoore and that one type of mob in the sundress I think looks silly.<br />
<br />
So far it's a tie!</div></div><hr />

Did one with slave pens last night(with a named in the room). Round room that's open at the top and with a bridge running over a big pit with cages in it. There were also cell/cages along the walls. I kind of expected some mobs in the cages but no such luck. Still pretty cool though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Ruj zones are interesting.  They seem kind of repetative but then bam you end up in this massive cavern with bridges and huts, etc.  Pretty cool. <br />
<br />
Miraguls.. Eveyone likes Ice.  I am waiting for Everquest: Lost Dungeons of Norrath: Velious. (On a side note I would not want lost dungeons of norrath: kunark, unless they get a new interior decorator :) )<br />
<br />
Tak.  Only done one of these, but it seemed pretty cool.  Lots of doors adds that bit of danger everytime you pop one open.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Autumn10</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally did a couple Miragul dungeons and I wasn't too impressed. Other than the 'elephant man gone wrong' most of the models have been used elsewhere. I have always kind of liked the 'mad wizard and his crazy experiment' theme though and the architecture kind of fits that. I would probably rank it above Ruj(it being dead last) but behind Tak, so in other words next to last. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadia brell</div><div class="date">09-18-2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">an  opinion from a pulling/charming chanter point of view<br />
<br />
1) Orcs is my favorite<br />
- wide tunnels, wolf pets, great visibility (except for at junctions)<br />
<br />
2) Tak: 2nd best for visibility, I call this the &quot;cheerful&quot; theme due its bright yello ambiance. Golem pets are fun<br />
<br />
3) Mira: took me a little bit to warm up to, but its the most scenic. I hate the fog, hate the charm pets  (all casters), and seems to be the slowest theme to achieve a win.<br />
<br />
4) MM: nice models and but theme reminds me too much of Unrest (and not oldworld mistmoore)<br />
<br />
5) Guk: nice models but poor visibility and pathing is a nightmare on rescue missions</div></div><hr />
