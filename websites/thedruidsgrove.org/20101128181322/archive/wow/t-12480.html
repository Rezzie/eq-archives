<br />
Two questions:<br />
<br />
1) Am I just pressing the button wrong or is this actually not possible in one button push due to the GDC? I want to switch and charge in one button push which is how the descriptions read. Or is that what &quot;spammable&quot; means?<br />
<br />
2) Can I add Enrage to the process if it's up?<br />
<br />
So far here's my macro:<br />
<br />
/cancelform [nostance:1]<br />
/cast [nostance] Dire Bear Form; [stance:1] Feral Charge<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance.<br />

You can't &quot;1 button push&quot; to cancel form, cast dire bear, enrage and charge, you need to spam the button to make all those things work.  Check out the website posted above.  He has an extensive section on macros...you'll probably find what you are looking for there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">03-23-2008, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the clarification. I've read a ton on macros (including a good deal of the link you reference and some of the links it references) and realize a lot changed in 2.0.<br />
<br />
It's been difficult to understand at times what a macro should do based on the description vs. the syntax. Literally every &quot;shift to bear and feral charge&quot; macro I've seen has omitted the part in the description that tells you how to use the macro. My assumption would be press it once.<br />
<br />
So one peculiarity I ran into testing this macro was that at times, when pressing it, I would get caught out of bear form. I was under the impression that if I pushed it and it began, it would finish. Not shift out of bear, then stop for some reason. Obviously if you are switching to bear form for defensive purposes, you want to get there as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
To that end now, I've changed the macro to just switch me to bear form without cancelling a form first (since it will happen automatically). I'm hoping this will cutdown on the poor timing of being stunned between shifts. Anyone have experience with this phenomenon and is it a result of using the: /cancelform [nostance:1] syntax at the beginning?<br />
<br />
Thanks again! I'll stop beating my head against the wall now trying to make it work. :beerchug:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">03-23-2008, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rule of thumb is you get one action that involves a global cooldown per button press and spamable does meen push it repeatedly. I might suggest using a /castsequence macro vs the one you had originally posted. As you mention in your second post you can lose the /cancelform bit. <br />
 <br />
Am thinking along the lines of:<br />
 <br />
/castsequence bear form, feral charge<br />
 <br />
...at least I think you do a comma in between. Because castsequence macros DO remember what was cast when they were last invoked it is a good idea to use the reset feature to bring them back to the base spell (not overly needed in this particular macro but good idea just the same). You can use any of the following to include: target, combat, amount of time, etc. You can also combine them with a &quot;/&quot; which mean &quot;or&quot; esentially<br />
 <br />
/castsequence reset=10/combat bear form, feral charge <br />
 <br />
translates into the macro reseting back to &lt;bear form&gt; being cast after 10 second if the button isn't pressed - ie you cast bear form but don't use feral charge for some reason - or you are no longer in combat.<br />
 <br />
For the second part you could try to put in the enrage but that might take some work. I would guess at the following (untested):<br />
 <br />
/cast [stance:1] enrage<br />
/castsequence reset=5 bear form, feral charge<br />
 <br />
Assuming you aren't in bear form this will (in theory) turn you into a bear, cast enrage if it is up, and then feral charge. Will end up being 2 to 3 clicks depending on the enrage part.<br />
 <br />
Now, all that said and to throw this out there what I like to do is utilize my scroll up and down on my mouse. Rebind those items away from your camera zoom and onto two different spots on a hot bar. In my case while in bear form those correlate to scroll up to feral charge and scroll down to enrage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">03-24-2008, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks! That's very helpful. So is there a silver bullet for knowing what triggers the GCD? I'm guessing Enrage doesn't for example since I was under the impression that if something *would* trigger it but doesn't, it still ends the macro.<br />
<br />
Also, in your example is that button truly spammable in that I can do those 2-3 things as fast as I press the button, or are there 1 second delays required between each push? Part of me thinks &quot;spammable&quot; = push it until your action(s) occur(s).<br />
<br />
I like the scroll wheel idea. My only reluctance is I had something bound there before but I'm so used to using it for Vent that when I was in arena I was too concerned about a premature Ferocious Bite. So I stopped using the wheel. I like it though. I'll need to play round with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">03-24-2008, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure of a silver bullet other than creating a button from your spell book or macro that does a single action. If you see the rest of your icons go gray/dim and &quot;cycle&quot; then you are invoking the GCD. The macro is spamable (click until you see action x) but with the constraint that only 1 thing is going to happen per 1.5 sec regardless if you hit is 10 times a second. Also be warned I don't think there is a way to &quot;lock out&quot; a macro to prevent clicking it too many times. In this case if you pushed the button at the 3.1 sec mark it would try to turn you into a bear again.<br />
 <br />
The beauty of the castsequence line is it remembers what on the line was cast last. Upon subsequent presses it does the next thing in line. Say you wanted to create a macro that turned you into bear form, bash the target, and then bandage your self. You could do <br />
 <br />
/castsequence bear form, bash, linen bandage (replace that with whatever bandage you might have)&lt;INSERT name bandage of&gt;<br />
 <br />
This is a three press button BUT iirc bandaging doesn't invoke the GCD so the 3rd button press could be done really fast. Click it too many times and you will find yourself in bear form.<br />
 <br />
Hopefully some of the above rambling helped. I like castsequence but should note they are susceptible to lag based performance issues - not to mention being rigid. If timing is very critical or the sitution is fluid it is probably best to shy away from very long ones unless you are able to inject a reset call that makes sense (ie when you change targets).</div></div><hr />

<br />
[nostance:1]...<br />
<br />
Thanks again! I'll watch for the GCD / fade out thing to get a better idea.<br />
<br />
Almost got all my macros doing what I want and bound where I need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">03-26-2008, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/cancelform [nostance:1]<br />
/castsequence reset=15 Dire Bear Form, Enrage, Feral Charge<br />
<br />
<br />
This macro will first cancel any form you happen to be in, then immedietely shift you to bear form.  This will invoke a global cooldown, as soon as the GCD is finished it will cause you to enrage, then charge your target.<br />
The macro should be completely spammable, just keep hammering the button.  :&gt;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">03-26-2008, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know I did try starting my macro with /cancelform but often I found myself in PvP hitting my hot key to go into a defensive bear stance and ending up stunned and stuck in Druid form too long. I thought it would happen simultaneously but this kept happening too often which is why I considered removing that part entirely.<br />
<br />
Why do I need the /cancelform if it automatically cancels when I shift to bear form? Would something like this solve that problem:<br />
<br />
/cast [nostance:1] Dire Bear Form<br />
/castsequence reset=10 Feral Charge, Enrage<br />
<br />
Would this automatically cancel my form if I wasn't in Bear Form and switch me to Bear? Then Feral Charge (I want to do this immediately to interupt casting rather than wait for the enrage) and then Enrage while still being spammable?<br />
<br />
If so this is my ideal macro. For now I had combined Feral Charge and Bash so which ever I was in range for would work. I think I just need to change to the ? icon so I can see which one is up and the relevant cool downs. Maybe I'll add , Bash at the end.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback. It's very helpful. :grin:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elymanrock</div><div class="date">03-28-2008, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you need to cancel the current form you maybe in cat form, travel form etc...<br />
<br />
Yeah also have a poundage version for when you are in bear form:<br />
<br />
/castsequence reset=2 Feral Charge, Maul, Mangle<br />
<br />
Most important to have Maul lined up, look for nice numbers, follow up with a swipe for 1,2,3 smackage. Who says ya can't do damage in bear form!</div></div><hr />
