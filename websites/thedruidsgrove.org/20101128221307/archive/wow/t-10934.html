You spent some time/money to get some nice equipment for the character, and you're finding some success in WSG.  So you start to accumulate WSG marks of honor, but not cashing them in.<br />
<br />
So it's tempting to keep the character at 19 forever, racking up honor points and such.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, you think it would be fun to actually do PvE stuff with it, like quests and instances, because it's well-equipped.<br />
<br />
What would you do?  Keep the character at 19, or level up? :sumo:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Practice</div><div class="date">08-10-2006, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Druid is a level 60 Private after only visiting WSG three or four times in his mid 20s.  I figured I needed some battleground experience before I felt comfortable taking him back in.  So I started an Undead Warlock alt with the intention of doing a few battlegrounds.  At level 19, he was a fantastic, immortal, killing machine!  I intended to keep him at that level because it was so much fun, but then my guildmates' alts all hit level 20.  I levelled up so that we could do battlegrounds together, but now it's just embarrasing how much he gets beaten up, and it's not a pleasant experience.  I think I'll stay out of them until I hit 25-ish.<br />
<br />
So if you want my advice, stay at 19 for a while and enjoy it.  Then, when you're ready, level up quickly to the high 20s and do the same.</div></div><hr />

You can't stay level 19 forever and continue to rank though.  Also, at level 19, your likely missing some great skills you'd pick up at 20. No?</div></div><hr />

Which would effectivly make lvl 19/29/39/49 twinks impossible.  I personally like the idea, im not a hardcore PVP'er when i'm leveling up.  Certainly not to the point of spending hundreds of gold on blue's to twink them out.  It will make doing occasional PVP while leveling to 60/70 much more viable and fun</div></div><hr />
