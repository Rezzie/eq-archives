 Alrighty...  <br />
 <br />
As I'm sure many of you have seen from the bits and pieces of information that I've posted in various threads on the forums, I've been looking into the issues that have been noticed since the AA consolidation. Listed below are all the issues that I've found, and what will be included in the next scheduled update, presuming it passes the QA process: <br />
 <br />
 Corrected an issue with Ranks 4 and 5 of the Innate Lung Capacity line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing lung capacity by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Extended Notes line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the bard song range by the appropriate percentage and will now increase it by the same percentage as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
     <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Double Riposte line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-riposte rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Ferocity line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-attack rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Knight's Advantage line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-attack rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 7, 8, and 9 of the Speed of the Knight line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the rate to fire an additional 2h attack by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 7, 8, and 9 of the Fury of Magic line of AA's for Clerics, Druids, Shaman, Enchanters, Magicians, and Necromancers. These ranks were not increasing the spell crit-rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 9, 10, and 11 of the Spell Casting Fury Mastery line of AA's for Wizards. These ranks were not increasing the spell crit-rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the Lightning Strike line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the flurry chance by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Spell Casting Subtlety line of AA's for all classes. These ranks were not reducing hate generation by the appropriate percentage. These ranks will now be reducing hate generation by the same percentage as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Combat Fury line of AA's for all classes who get the ability. These ranks were not adding the appropriate amount of crit-rate chance, and even decreasing the crit-rate chance in some situations. These ranks will now be adjusting the crit-rate chance by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
This addresses all issues found through my extensive parsing of the old and new AA data, with the exception of one potential, Rogue-specific issue that will require some additional time to parse and verify. <br />
 <br />
Feel free to ask questions, I'll try and answer as many of them as I can, though hopefully this will put everything back to the way it was before the consolidation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think their plan is to do all of the old world, starting with areas close to cities and working outward.<br />

I am sure of it.</div></div><hr />

It's funny how they're putting so much work into revamping all these old zones that most of their current player base doesn't even go to and yet they're not bothering in the slightest to try and attract new players who would be the ones to really notice this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The west bug sucks too...<br />
It hits me almost everyday. Mostly happens when doing AG raids. It's even worse when I get it during AG west. I get it going into Solteris also. I rarely get it when doing FC raids though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She asks that you let her know if you've found a zone where a revamp accidentally disabled manastone usage.<br />

So, it has been several months since I have tried it in ANY of the revamped zones.  I guess I better go back and check them.<br />
<br />
It use to not work in ANY of them.  I am quite sure of that because it would be the first thing I checked when a zone was revamped.<br />
<br />
Thank yuo for the link and the information, it is much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zatozia informed me she was frowarding the list of zones the manastone does not work in to the programmers.  So, hopefully we will see a fix go in soon.</div></div><hr />
