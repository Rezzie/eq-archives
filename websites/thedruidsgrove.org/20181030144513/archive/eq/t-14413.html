 <br />
Pure Live vs Chlorotrope<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Correct these numbers but I have:<br />
 <br />
Pure Life (72) = 3176 for 742 mana (4.48)<br />
Chlorotrope (68) = 2275 for 625 mana (3.64)<br />
 <br />
Assuming max 28% boost via healing AA's<br />
 <br />
Purelife = 4065<br />
Chlorotrope = 2912<br />
 <br />
Now assuming existing focus effects (best case LOL) and lowering Purelife by the standard 5% per level over the 70 focus effect cap means that Pure Life loses 10% of your normal level 70 focus:<br />
 <br />
Example: (70 healing focus item) <br />
 <br />
20% becomes 16%<br />
30% becomes 24%<br />
35% becomes 28%<br />
 <br />
So if you currently have a level 70 focus of 20%/30%/35% the spells would heal:<br />
 <br />
Pure Life = 4715/5041/5203<br />
Chlorotrope = 3494/3786/3931<br />
 <br />
So it appears that Purelife heals 32% and about 1250ish more for an extra 117ish mana. Pretty sweet if you ask me. Is it enough... not sure but it's better :)<br />

i estimated rank 2 and 3 for pure life.<br />

<br />
as more info comes in on new aa effects and better numbers on spells, i'll update further<br />
<br />
btw, i believe IH foci lose 10% per level</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ok thanks... was not sure how that worked so when it degrades it degrades 10% per level so:<br />
 <br />
35% becomes 28%<br />
30% becomes 24%<br />
20% becomes 16%<br />
 <br />
This correct? If so I'll update the numbers.<br />

<br />
You have it listed as 2.2k and 625.<br />
<br />
It heals from 2790 to 2810 at 691 mana.  This is 4.07 and it heals 3596.8 at 28% adept.<br />
<br />
Anicent is: 3094 at 723<br />
<br />
This is 4.28 and it heals 3960.72 after 28% adept.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Cassea also focii work for 1/2 value on average ...<br />
level 70 focus of 20%/30%/35% i.e 1.1 1.15 1.175 multiplier on average (70), 1.08 1.12 1.14 (72)<br />
Pure Life = 4390/4552/4634<br />
Chlorotrope = 3203/3348/3421<br />
 <br />
on average .. right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">09-21-2006, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd take the average heal value since that is what your most likely to see.  This is halving the Focus percentage.<br />
<br />
Also, keep in mind when factoring the best heal, when your current focus begins to degrade, be it 67, 68, or 70.<br />
<br />
Due to focus degrade, Anicent may actually be better for use then Pure Life, but I've yet to run those numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You fizzle the new spells because your skills are not where they need to be to cast them due to the skill increase.<br />
<br />
Our casting skills currently max at 312 iirc.</div></div><hr />

Pure Life is a 12% upgrade over Chloro, minus some loss on focus for most people... Tier 3 will be a 21% upgrade, again with focus considerations, thought many people that get the tier 3 version will likely have one of the focus items that will work up to 72.<br />
 <br />
Those with ancient chloro will not even see that much upgrade - I Will take what I can get though so don't get me wrong, just pointing out that comments above about 30+% increases are wrong.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Chlorotrope... HPM 6.91 | HPS 1637 / 882 <br />
Ancient ... HPM 7.27 (7.48) | HPS 1803 / 971 <br />

Pure life rk 3 ... HPM 6.89 | HPS 1691 / 963<br />
 <br />
2nd HPM number for ancient is with bp... improved healing and mana pres foci halfed to represent avgs.  First hps is not including recast for when you just want a burst, 2nd is sustained hps if you were to chain cast.<br />

<br />
The only time i notice a difference between the two is in crit heals.. other then that.. its a couple 100 hitpoints either way.. as if it REALLY matters on a 15k tank.   We are debating really penny anty stuff here..... I dont get into mana / vs heal etc etc.  It got by how it feels when you use it... <br />
<br />
Give me a 7k quick heal and ill be impressed.. other then that.. its the newest quick heal and I use it</div></div><hr />

Yes, when you start doing encounters which lasts 20+ minutes, it matters.</div></div><hr />

II almost exclusivley, Adrenaline Surge Rk. II if a really quick heal is needed and KR for the times I am on the CHR. So far for me, PL and AS seem to give me anywhere from 8k -11k exceptional heals someaht frequently. I have not seen any of the other Druid heals come close to this, and I have them all up to the TSS Rk. II heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ieglawen</div><div class="date">02-16-2007, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which heal you use really depends on where you are in progression. For groupers and family guilds the new spells are probably your best bet. For raiding druids in ... Anguish/Demi, you probably are more cost efficient using the level 70 ancient because of focus effects. I use the Everspring Jerkin which makes using ancient MUCH more effective than Pure Life. After Demi you can start getting into healing focus items that make Pure Life better again.<br />
My only point is if you are blindly using the new spells without considering your focus effects, you may be burning more mana than you need to. Sure its nice to see the high crits, but we need to consider endurance too.<br />
BTW Ancient Chlorobon can crit 11k with the right gear. I think I've done 12k, but if I did its pretty rare.</div></div><hr />
