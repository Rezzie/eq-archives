For Kharazan (http://www.wowwiki.com/Kharazan) you need to complete the quest Entry Into Karazhan (http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:Entry_Into_Karazhan).You need a couple of prequests that's started just outside the instance in Deadwind pass- Arcane Disturbances (http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:Arcane_Disturbances) and Restless Activity (http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:Restless_Activity). I don't think you need to be lvl 70 to start these 2 first quest and no faction rep is required.<br />
<br />
I knicked info from RuadhTheRed , hope it was ok;) and will add more as it comes<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's something quick I threw together from WowWiki.com:<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
Heroic mode refers to a Dungeon Difficulty setting. The difficulty setting for a dungeon is accessed from the party leader's portrait menu; currently the only other difficulty setting is Normal Mode (the default setting).<br />
<br />
Each of the Outland dungeons may be run on Heroic Mode if every member of the party has obtained the appropriate key. The key for each dungeon is reached by achieving Revered reputation with the appropriate faction.<br />
<br />
In Heroic Mode, the mobs and bosses in the dungeon are much tougher, with more hit points, more damage, and more difficult special attacks. The rewards are conciderably greater than on normal mode and all Heroic Mode bosses drop a Badge of Justice for each party member.<br />
<br />
Heroic Mode dungeons are on a timer, and can only be run once per character per day. Each dungeon is on an independent timer.<br />
HEROIC MODE KEYS<br />
<br />
Each group has a mix of quests and repeatable quests that will grant faction. There are also 1 or 2 dungeons that grant faction from killing the mobs that reside in there.<br />
