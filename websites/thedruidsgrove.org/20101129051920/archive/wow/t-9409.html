Do the opposite of what a rogue would do and head away from the warrior.... as far as your cast range allows and root from there.<br />
<br />
I don't always like to act in that manner.... but hey, if a win is what you want all bets are off.</div></div><hr />

I expect the first charge so I drop into Bear before the fight starts.  Sit there and wait, and then build up Rage.  Use Frenzied Regen, continue whacking away at the warrior, then Bash, Shift out, Apply Regrowth + Rejuvination, shift back to Bear, and continue tanking them.  I usually last long enough to be able to Bash  and reapply both HoTs again, but not everything goes to plan so you may want to just NS + Both HoTs and then Innervate yourself to negate the mana cost of shifting back for the 2nd time while preparing your mana for a possible 3rd reapply of both HoTs.  The Warrior is usually done for though by the time my second set of HoTs run their course.</div></div><hr />

Do you time your bash/heals in between the MS spam?  I'm at work atm so I do not have access to the actual duration/cooldown timers of the ability.  Please advise how you work around this.  Thx in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">10-12-2005, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I usually wait until I am down to about half health to give myself some room to NS + Regrowth incase my Bash is dodged, parried, ect.  The cooldown on Bash is 1 minute, and with improved Bash (since 1.8) it is now a 5 second stun, which is plenty of time to cast both HoTs and shift back before they can do anything.</div></div><hr />

Warriors love to start fights w/ Charge because it gives them rage to begin with.  Also this will usually get them to use their PvP trinket right off the bat.  Then enables you to root them later in the fight and not worry about them getting out of it to finish you off.  What I like to do when my health is around 50%ish is bash them, THEN root because more than likely, you have been MS'd.  Once I root them I let the MS fade and throw up Regrowth and Rejuv.  If Innervate calls than I'll burn that but depending on your/the war's gear you may not need it.  Anyway, from there just dwindle their hp down, throw up another Natures Grasp when you get a chance and finish em off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">10-14-2005, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I misread what you typed Tygre lol.  To be honest, I never really pay attention to MS when I am fighting warriors.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've actually had them use it on me in Duels and in open PvP around the maps.  <br />
<br />
If anything I would probably respond using what Badgemagus put up.  Bash and Root and wait it out before healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimfiend</div><div class="date">10-14-2005, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The above strategies are solid, tried and true. On the use of travel form to keep distance and using DOTs to do the killing: try stacking Insect Swarm with Moonfire now that we get both. I personally don't like having a warrior anywhere in my personal space, so here is strategy number three: Root, bomb, bomb, bomb, root, repeat. <br />
<br />
I stay away from Moonfire when I want to maintain root because Moonfire breaks root too easy. Many times root will start to break on me mid-cast if I try to get off a third Starfire, but three Wraths are no problem to get off.<br />
<br />
If you're actually *duelling*, hit him with an insta. I've been gone for a while, but it used to be that they couldn't charge once combat was initiated. And start from extreme range so you have time to get your root off.<br />
<br />
If you're in real PVP and they get the jump on you, use your Nature's Grasp right away and get some distance. As a matter of fact, using NG at any point is pretty okay since it lasts 45 seconds and if they break root and get a hit in on you it is probably a very good time for a root anyway.<br />
<br />
Obviously, if the warrior is tough then you will have a problem with mana lasting long enough to take him down. If you need to drop a potion or Innervate then do it. Small price to pay. Also, I haven't had to deal with 60 vs 60 combat yet – this is all coming from a 52. I know they get a lot tougher as time goes by.<br />
<br />
Lastly, don't be dead-set in using only one strategy. If one isn't working out for you on a particular fight, change to a different strategy. The ones listed above are all good.</div></div><hr />

Meleeing a war with end game EQ is usually bad idea if you cant back it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-22-2005, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally use cat form/sneak to start the fight.  Pounce, rip, rake back up and faerie fire, go caster form and moonfire then go bear form.  At this point he has take 3 weak dot's and a moonfire and I'm full health.  I then fight in bear form until around half and stun, if the stun is resisted/broken I'll go caster and NG then back out and heal, if he somehow breaks the NG I'll use a potion(for real pvp).  Go back to bear form and fight some more saving rage for a regeneration which I generally don't need since they are dead before the fight gets that far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tactics are simple:<br />
<br />
Initial just before duel starts Barkskin and Bear, Click Enrage<br />
<br />
Rdy for Intercept but he will do no damage though cause of Bark and bear secondly the entire time your building rage...<br />
<br />
Now maul him a few times and then hit frenzied regen try too do this when ms is not on you. <br />
<br />
Keep the beat down going... Bash, Root, Heal or just Bash Heal<br />
<br />
Then when they are at about 20% health jump out moonfire, Rejuv and Bear again.  Its attrecian at this stage you can heal he can't.<br />
<br />
One important thing if your Feral keep FF on him at all times otherwise when you pop to heal etc FF him to reduce his armour you will be suprised the difference that one spell makes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Priests, now there are some face melters. Priests are wicked, counterspells, awesome heals, HoT's, DoT's, even direct dmg, AND a bubble.<br />
<br />
My strat is to use dot's when they drop the PW:S Bomb, so wear it down with as little mana ass possible, then, hop into bear and start whittling their HP down down dooooown, dont forget to bash then they try to heal. Pop out whenever to heal, or Freznied Regen works too, as you wont be mauling very much. Cat form is also a choice, I feel putting dash on and running by and Clawing, then turning around and jumping and clawing and repeating till dash wears works... but only for those 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
So far I have yet to lose to a priest. The only real class I have a problem with in PvP is Shaman for sure, warriors are a joke, even with their plate. Mages are plaything, rogue's are a decent challenge, but if you hold yourself together you'll be ok, lock rely on their curses, and thanks ze gods we have a decurse, so they arent too bad. Ummm Pally's... I wont even waste my time, hunters, hibernate the pet ANNHILATE the hunter, that just about covers it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone with tips on killing shaman's be more than welcome to drop me a line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-02-2005, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a shadow priest alt, lv 37 right now, and yes, they do melt faces in pvp.  Some tips on fighting shadow priests:<br />
<br />
If you see their hands start to glow shadowy, run through them (so that you are behind them).  This is when they are casting Mind Blast, which if they have shadow weaving 5/5 on you can be pretty nasty.  If you can get behind them, the spell will fail, and they will have to start over with the 1.5 sec cast, or realize that you know what you are doing and give up on using that spell at all.<br />
<br />
PvP until you get the trinket that dispells fear.  If you dont have that, you will probably lose to the priest 8/10 times.  In the 8 sec that you are running feared, they can do massive damage.<br />
<br />
Mind Flay is a nasty spell - big damage over 3 sec, and slows movement by 50%.  Best way to counter this is to Feral Charge.  <br />
<br />
Don't rely on mf to much for dot, as any good priest will dispel the dot magic.  For that matter, they will do that to roots too.  1.9 is nerfing priests again - doubling the cost of dispel magic, which will force a lot of them to accept more dot, or run oom faster.<br />
<br />
My strat vs priests, who I find much easier now that I have played one, depends on who gets the jump:<br />
<br />
If they get the jump on you, quick regrowth rejuv, mf, then into bear for a feral charge, beat on them for a bit, until about 50% health, then bash and pop out and regrowth rejuv.  Then to cat with dash ftw.  One thing to watch out for is that they don't silence you before you get into a form or heal.  Silence only lasts 5 sec, but thats lots of damage.  If you do get silenced, there is nothing really that you can do.  A lot of priests will wait to use silence (2min cooldown) until you are going to heal the second time.  This is where improved bash comes in huge - 5sec stun = plenty of time to pop out regrow rejuv then back to bear/cat.<br />
<br />
If I get the jump on them, the battle is usually much easier.  I start in cat, stealth and tigers fury ravage (a big crit on the priest to start will really fluster them, and they will have to spend valuable time healing themselves while you are shredding their face).  PW:Shield costs quite a bit of mana, and the more they spend on this the less they have for damage to you.  And priest oom = dead priest.  Dash and run circles around them clawing and building combo points.  I then rip, then switch out with about 60%health, regrowth and rejuv, root, back up switch to bear, feral charge maul and bash ftw.<br />
<br />
Wow.  sorry for the long post.  And I also could use some tips on fighting shammies. Best one I've seen so far is the macro for targeting totems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">12-02-2005, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HoT always gets dispelled. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">12-04-2005, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that I have done to shammys is to fake a heal.  Use something like a hearthstone or even a teleport to moonglade and they will normally shock you to disrupt what really looks like a heal.  At that point you can heal and go back into form.<br />
<br />
This works well if bash doesn't work... and you take a shock before you heal.<br />
<br />
If you fight in bear, you can regenerate mana while they spend time using mana for totems and shocks and redoing their lighting shield.  All in all you will eventually get them to a point where they have little mana and you still have the resources to win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am full on feral spec with about 12k in ac. So i go bear.<br />
<br />
I hit FB at about the 1/2 health point. If i think i need further healing. I just bash pop out heal and finish them off in bear.<br />
<br />
For the most part i can kill them straight up without needing to heal.</div></div><hr />
