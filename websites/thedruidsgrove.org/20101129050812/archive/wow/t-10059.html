<br />
The thread before the pvp pissing thread was locked because it wasn't in the pvp section.  They were told to go to the pvp section where they wouldn't be moderated.<br />
<br />
Then they get that one locked too.<br />
<br />
I am not saying that I completely agree with all the personal attacks but they did do what you told them to do - battle it out in the pvp area.<br />
<br />
Why was that one locked too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rail against the game, call xyz tactics stupid, say that abc talent build is retarded, that's fine -- calling a person stupid, that's not.  If you want to argue, argue the topic.  That's my take on it, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is dissapointing that if someone calls someone stupid the conversation is lost.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to attack the moderation here - you guys do 10x better than the bliz guys do.</div></div><hr />

I did think about removing just the personal attacks, but honestly, I don't have the time to read through all the posts again and see which ones are attacks (and some were pretty veiled, so it's hard to decide where to draw the line).<br />
<br />
Will keep it mind for the future though and try to tag the attacks if I can.</div></div><hr />
