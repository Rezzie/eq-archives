<br />
I am currently writing a series of articles about the Feral Druid, and they are in German. One of these days I might get around to translating them, but that may take some time.<br />
<br />
Can I post them here, even though they are in German?</div></div><hr />

But it would put my brain to work on that German I learned in college but never use....</div></div><hr />

Even if you were allowed to post them, not sure how resourceful they would be because I'm not sure how much of our Forum-goer's know any German.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't mind - it'd give me an extra opportunity to improve my German outside of school.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing in the rules either way about languages, though obviously this is an English language forum.  I think posting the guides will be fine, though you may want to indicate it's in German in the thread title.<br />

Feel free to PM me with any other questions.</div></div><hr />
