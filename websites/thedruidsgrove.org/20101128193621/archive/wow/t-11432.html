Then run it some more.<br />
<br />
Dire Maul north drops the Hide of the Wild pattern, and while it MAY become quickly outdated with the expansion, it's another very nice peice of healing gear you can make for yourself and others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-05-2007, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are feral and have Heart of the Wild and some Int gear, your mana pool will be big enough to heal just fine in most instances.  <br />
<br />
The resto tree was really about making healing cheaper and more effective, allowing us to downrank spells to save mana.  This is no longer as viable (still can be done for sure) with the nerf to downranking at the patch.  A heavy resto build with ToL has made healing 5 and 10 mans much easier, almost a joke.  <br />
<br />
With HoTW and some good +healing gear (shoot for about +250 to +300), you can very effectivley heal as a feral.  Use your Healing Touch rank 8 and highest rank rejuv.  The trick to HT is to be proactive, and start casting right around when the tank is at about 75 to 80%.  Touch up the other classes with your Rejuv.<br />
<br />
If you are resto and like resto, by all means stay that way.  If you want to try out feral, know that you will be able to heal just fine (though your heals won't be as strong, and you'll probably be drinking some more.  General consensus is that feral is faster for leveling, as the solo / grinding / killing goes faster, but leveling as resto is very viable too.  <br />
<br />
Personally I have a 0/30/21 build and love it.<br />
<br />
As for Mace v Staff, take whatever you find that has better stats.  Typically 2h maces are the best for feral, and you can find a bunch with really good stats in instances or rewards from instances (fist of omokk, unyielding maul, bonecrusher, doomulus prime).  Of course the best tanking weapon in the game is the Warden Staff, which is a lv 40 something epic.  <br />
<br />
For casting, you have a lot of options, though you will probably find that staves are the way to go.  At your level, you should try to get the Zum'rah's Vexing Cane from ZF.  It has like 10 int 10 spi and +21 to damage and healing.  That'll take you to 60, when you can get any number of good instance drop staves.  For pure healing, there is a staff that drops in Live Strat called Redemption that has +66 to healing and +12spi.</div></div><hr />

I didnt like it much for healing. it was a lil harder (BRD) so i went back to full resto. gives me a chance to learn how to heal a little better. I was playing with a tank that was not holding mi heal aggro and it made me so mad i was casting juv and regrow in tree form and an occ. touch if needed we had a 60 rouge a 60 lock and a 56 rouge with us. why would i be getting so much threat??? any way to reduce it fast? ohh and i picked up changuk mace and cloud orb to switch but i have a staff thats +51 to healing spells. To speed things up ive been questing with others makes stuff faster but i still do a lil solo work XD.</div></div><hr />

Last night we ran ZG and we downed 4 bosses without the healers needing to drink once.Too bad blizzard noticed the imba healing and now we got a heavy nerf just as I was about to respec.</div></div><hr />
