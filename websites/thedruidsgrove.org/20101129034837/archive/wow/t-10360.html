<br />
    World of Warcraft Client Patch 1.10.0<br />
    (Disclaimer: These patch notes are for the Public Test Realm and the content of the patch is subject to change.)<br />
<br />
    New High-Level Armor Sets!<br />
<br />
    Adventurers of Azeroth can now quest to upgrade their previous Rare-quality Dungeon set to a new, higher-quality set, including epic gear! These tasks include all-new boss encounters, so prepare your finest group of dungeon-delvers and prepare for a challenge!<br />
<br />
    Weather!<br />
<br />
    Weather has been introduced in the following areas around Azeroth:<br />
    o Elwynn Forest<br />
    o Tirisfal Glades<br />
    o Dun Morogh<br />
    o Darkshore<br />
    o Alterac Mountains<br />
    o Stranglethorn Vale<br />
    o Feralas<br />
    o Un'Goro Crater<br />
    o Tanaris<br />
    o Winterspring<br />
    o Ahn'Qiraj<br />
    We will be adding more weather to the world as time progresses; this is simply the beginning!<br />
<br />
    High-Level Instance Changes<br />
<br />
    Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.<br />
<br />
    Quest Experience to Gold Conversion at Level 60<br />
<br />
    Previously, quest experience was wasted if one completed a quest at level 60. In this patch, any quests done at maximum level will have their experience reward converted to a healthy amount of gold, thus adding additional incentive to completing those quests in your log once you hit 60.<br />
<br />
    New Final Destination Flight Paths!<br />
<br />
    If you're making several jumps to get to your destination, you will now be able to choose that flight path from your initial Flight Master. The costs will remain the same, but you no longer need to manually click on each path. The UI has also been improved significantly.<br />
<br />
    General<br />
<br />
        * All spells/abilities that remove existing effects (e.g. Dispel Magic, Cleanse, Remove Curse etc...) will now verify that there is an effect that can be removed before casting.<br />
        * You will no longer lose your current target when affected by a crowd control spell (e.g. Fear, Polymorph etc...).<br />
        * Various tooltips updated.<br />
        * Pets no longer modify your reputation if you kill them.<br />
        * You no longer teleport to your flight destination when hit by snowballs.<br />
        * Passive damage effects like Oil of Immolation will cause creatures to attack when they are hit.<br />
        * Turning off the At-War flag will no longer stop neutral guards from attacking you.<br />
        * Trying to spoof item links will disconnect you.<br />
        * Fixed error message when attempting to start melee combat while unable to attack.<br />
        * Channelled spells are cancelled when a rogue vanishes.<br />
        * Channelled spells are cancelled when you zone.<br />
        * Damage over time spells are no longer affected by changes in equipment after the cast.<br />
        * You are no longer kept in combat while on auto-attack at long range.<br />
        * Area effect spells and abilities will no longer consider totems as valid targets.<br />
        * Charm spells on charmed creatures are no longer available to the players that charm them.<br />
        * Fixed a bug which could cause lava flows to be improperly rendered or invisible. <br />
<br />
    PvP &amp; Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
        * Alterac Valley<br />
          o Flavor items from player loot in Alterac Valley will now stack and can be sold for a small value. These are items like Documents from Boomstick Imports, Worn Running Shoes, etc.<br />
          o Players in Alterac Valley will no longer drop Darkspear Troll Mojo, Dwarf Spines, Forsaken Hearts, Human Bone Chips, Orc Teeth, etc. and the quests have been removed for these items. Instead when a player is slain in Alterac Valley, any enemies that were in that player's threat list will gain 1 point of reputation with either the Frostwolf or Stormpike factions.<br />
          o Frostwolf and Stormpike faction will now be gained by killing players of the opposite faction. Reputation will no longer be split up among the entire raid group.<br />
          o Tower Banners in Alterac Valley can no longer be used through walls.<br />
          o Korrak the Bloodrager and his band of trolls have packed up their bags and left Alterac Valley for greener pastures.<br />
        * The reputation gain in Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin has been significantly increased. <br />
<br />
    Druids<br />
<br />
        * Healing Touch - Mana cost on all ranks reduced approximately 9%.<br />

        * A new level 52 druid quest that takes place in Un'Goro crater has been added. <br />
<br />
    Hunters<br />
<br />
        * Multi-Shot - This ability now has its attack power normalized the same as melee instant attacks. This means that the attack power contribution from all ranged weapons will be the same, no matter what their speed. All weapons will contribute attack power as if they were 2.8 speed. Weapons slower than 2.8 speed will do slightly less damage than previously; weapons faster than 2.8 speed will do slightly more damage.<br />
        * Aimed Shot - This ability now has its attack power normalized the same as melee instant attacks. This means that the attack power contribution from all ranged weapons will be the same, no matter what their speed. All weapons will contribute attack power as if they were 2.8 speed. Weapons slower than 2.8 speed will do slightly less damage than previously; weapons faster than 2.8 speed will do slightly more damage.<br />
        * Improved Aspect of the Hawk - The buff from this talent has had its duration increased from 8 seconds to 12 seconds. Note that the haste it provides does not begin until the second shot after the triggering shot. This change is to compensate for that delay.<br />
        * Hunter's Mark - This spell no longer triggers procs on the spell caster. This was being abused to land debuffs without getting on the creature's hate list.<br />
        * Claw and Bite - Pets using these abilities will now generate the correct amount of threat. Only ranks 7 and 8 of claw were generating the correct amount previously.<br />
        * Bestial Wrath - No longer generates threat for the Hunter.<br />
        * New high-level boars now exist in the Eastern Plaguelands and have a new rank 6 version of the pet ability: Charge.<br />
        * The special turtle ability Shell Shield has been improved to no longer root or pacify the turtle, but instead apply a 30% melee slow for the duration of the effect. Cooldown has been improved from 5 minutes to 3 minutes.<br />
        * Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.<br />
        * Pet Frenzy - This effect will now trigger off any kind of critical hit by the pet.<br />
        * Fixed problem where a tamed pet would be lost if the hunter died as the tame completed.<br />
        * Distract no longer rotates hunters who have feigned death. <br />
<br />
    Mages<br />
<br />
        * Improved Frost Ward - This ability now functions properly again.<br />
        * Improved Fire Ward - This ability now functions properly again.<br />
        * Detect Magic - This spell no longer triggers procs on the spell caster. This was being abused to land debuffs without getting on the creature's hate list.<br />
        * Ignite - This talent will now only trigger off fire damage generated by mage spells. In addition, when a fire spell is reflected back at the caster, the caster will now correctly receive the Ignite damage.<br />
        * Arcane Brilliance - Range and area of effect increased.<br />
        * Impact - When a fire spell is reflected back at the caster, the caster will now correctly receive the Impact effect. <br />
<br />
    Paladins<br />
<br />
        * Blessing of Light - Different ranks of this spell were stacking without causing additional effect. It was never intended for them to be able to stack, so they can no longer stack.<br />
        * Judgement of Justice - This judgement will now always hit.<br />
        * Righteous Fury - Righteous Fury will now always generate the correct amount of additional threat on all holy damage. There were some abilities, such as Retribution Aura, where this did not work correctly.<br />
        * Holy Shock - This ability now works with Divine Favor and Illumination.<br />
        * Holy Shield - Mana cost reduced approximately 15%. The effect now has a small bonus coefficient from spell damage items and effects.<br />
        * Eye for an Eye - This talent can now trigger while you are mounted.<br />
        * Blessing of Sacrifice - This Blessing can no longer be used to prevent the death of a target that is supposed to die for a spell effect (e.g.: Sacrifice, Demonic Sacrifice, Divine Intervention, Ritual of Doom).<br />
        * Seal of Command - Will now be able to proc when the Paladin is silenced.<br />
        * Improved Seal of Righteousness - Tooltip updated to reflect actual functionality. This talent increases Seal of Righteousness and Judgement of Righteousness by 3-15%.<br />
        * Lay on Hands - Range increased.<br />
        * Divine Intervention - Range increased.<br />
        * Holy Shield - Tooltip updated to reflect that damage caused by Holy Shield causes 20% additional threat. This has been active since 1.9, but was undocumented.<br />
        * All Greater Blessings now have increased range.<br />
        * Holy Shock - Mana cost reduced.<br />
        * Most creatures that were previously immune to Scorpid Sting are now also immune to the Paladin Talent Vindication.<br />
        * Fixed problem where occasionaly repeated casts of Consecration will not deal damage.<br />
        * If a paladin avoids damage with Divine Shield, Eye for an Eye will not react.<br />
        * Fixed stacking of paladin auras so they overlap, but only the best aura in a given category is in effect. <br />
<br />
    Priests<br />
<br />
        * Due to significant talent changes, Priests will have all talent points refunded and can be respent. Training costs for all talent spell replacements have been significantly reduced.<br />
        * All racial priest spell replacements have had their training costs reduced.<br />
        * Prayer of Fortitude - Range and area of effect increased.<br />
        * Holy Fire - Is now available to all priests, starting at level 20.<br />
        * Mind Soothe - Is now instant cast.<br />
        * Shadowform - Now reduces all physical damage taken (melee and ranged), as the tooltip suggests.<br />
        * Feedback (Human) - Redesigned. The priest surrounds himself with anti-magic energy. Any successful spell cast against the priest will burn mana from the attacker and cause Shadow damage.<br />
        * Elune's Grace (Night Elf) - Now also increases chance to dodge. Ranged damage reduction increased, duration decreased, mana cost decreased, now has a cooldown.<br />
        * Shadowguard (Troll) - Is now instant cast. Updated tooltip to reflect that damage caused by Shadowguard causes no threat. This was previously the case, but was undocumented.<br />
        * Inner Fire - Redesigned. Now increases armor by a significant amount but has 20 charges. Each melee or ranged damage hit will remove a charge. Lasts 10 minutes, mana cost increased.<br />
        * Desperate Prayer (Dwarf/Human) - Cooldown reduced.<br />
        * Touch of Weakness (Undead) - Now a 10 min. buff on the caster that is triggered when they are struck in melee. The effect is otherwise the same. Mana cost decreased substantially.<br />
        * Hex of Weakness (Troll) - Now also applies a -20% healing modifier in addition to its normal effect. The healing debuff does not stack with the warrior's Mortal Strike ability, although the damage penalty now stacks with either Touch of Weakness or Curse of Weakness. Mana cost decreased substantially.<br />
        * Starshards (Night Elf) - This spell now works like Curse of Agony, with lower initial damage which increases as the duration continues. Mana cost dropped approximately 30% on all ranks. Ranks 1 and 2 increased to 6 second duration. Damage increased approximately 17%.<br />
        * Lesser Heal - Mana cost dropped approximately 9%.<br />
        * Heal - Ranks 2, 3, and 4, cast time reduced to 3 seconds. Rank 1 mana cost dropped approximately 9%. Rank 2, 3, and 4 the healing amount has been reduced to generate the same amount of healing per cast time as before the cast time was reduced. Rank 2, 3, and 4, the mana cost was reduced to cost approximately 9% less mana per point of healing generated. The net effect on all ranks is that the healing per mana is 10% higher, the cast time is limited to 3 seconds, and the healing per second is unchanged. Note that spells with less than 3.5 second cast time will not receive the full bonus from plus healing items.<br />
        * Greater Heal - Cast time reduced to 3 seconds. Healing and Mana cost reduced so that the healing per second is unchanged, but the healing per mana is increased approximately 10%. Note that spells with less than 3.5 second cast time will not receive the full bonus from plus healing items.<br />
        * Vampiric Embrace - Damage resisted by the target will no longer be counted as damage caused for the purposes of the healing from this ability.<br />
        * Power Word: Shield - This spell will now get a small bonus from items and effects which increase your healing.<br />
        * Holy Nova - Self cooldown on this spell removed. Mana cost increased.<br />
        * Devouring Plague - No longer keeps players in combat for its duration. <br />
<br />
    Rogues<br />
<br />

        * Sap - Lightning Shield will no longer break Stealth when the Sap is resisted.<br />
        * Remorseless Attacks - This ability will no longer trigger off killing creatures that do not award experience, or players that do not award honor.<br />
        * Distract - This ability will no longer trigger a Shaman's Lightning Shield (which caused the Rogue to lose stealth).<br />
        * Blade Flurry - The additonal attacks generated by this ability will now properly take into account the armor of the second target.<br />
        * Blind - Now considered a ranged attack. It can no longer be dodged or parried.<br />
        * Creatures will no longer get one hit on a rogue before cheap shot takes effect. <br />
<br />
    Shaman<br />
<br />
        * Lightning Shield - Bonfires and other environmental damage sources will no longer consume charges of the Lightning Shield. Warsong Gulch power-ups will also no longer consume the charges.<br />
        * Grounding Totem - This totem will no longer absorb the procs from: Frostguard, Annihilator, Bludgeon of the Grinning Dog, The Chief's Enforcer, The Judge's Gavel, Hammer of the Titans, Blackblade of Shahram, and Bonereaver's Edge. Tooltip updated to be more clear.<br />
        * Flurry - Your haste will now last only the intended next 3 swings.<br />
        * Healing Wave - Mana cost on all ranks reduced approximately 9%.<br />
        * Shaman can now use equipped items while in Ghost Wolf form.<br />
        * Shaman will no longer stop falling when they use a Sentry Totem. <br />
<br />
    Warlocks<br />
<br />

        * Shadowburn - The debuff which produces the soul shard upon death is now visble to the player and has a 5 sec duration. The Warlock will no longer sometimes receive two soul shards upon the victim's death. Targets which do not grant experience or honor will no longer produce shards.<br />
        * Rain of Fire - This ability will correctly trigger Pyroclasm again.<br />
        * Master Demonologist - Pets that were crowd controlled at the moment of summon prevented you from receiving the buff from this talent. That has been fixed.<br />
        * Curse of Doom - This curse can no longer be cast on players who are under the control of a creature.<br />
        * Shadowburn - This spell will no longer apply its debuff to the creature when the spell is resisted. Targets which do not grant experience or honor will no longer produce shards.<br />

<br />
    Warriors<br />
<br />
        * Execute - This ability will now work with Sweeping Strikes again. If the second victim is below 20% health, they will be hit with the full Execute amount. If the second victim is not below 20% health, they will be hit with normal melee swing damage.<br />
        * Whirlwind - When this ability is used with Sweeping Strikes, it will burn only one charge of Sweeping Strikes and will generate only one additional attack.<br />
        * Flurry - Ranks 1 through 4 of this talent will now activate correctly again.<br />
        * Retaliation - This ability will now function correctly at full melee range.<br />
        * Intimidating Shout - The cowering in fear effect will no longer be applied when the target resists this shout. In addition, this shout will now affect a maximum of 5 targets.<br />
        * Flurry - Your haste will now last only the intended next 3 swings.<br />
        * Sweeping Strikes - The additonal attacks generated by this ability will now properly take into account the armor of the second target. <br />
<br />
    Items<br />
<br />
        * Relics have been introduced to the game. These are class specific items for Druids, Paladins, and Shaman which can be equipped in the ranged slot. Currently there are a handful for each class which can be found scattered throughout Blackrock Depths, Blackrock Spire, Dire Maul, Scholomance, Stratholme, and The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. We hope that you enjoy the first round of available relics and we will continue to add more in future patches.<br />
        * Many items in Blackrock Depths, Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Spire have been re-evaluated and adjusted to make them more appealing. In addition several new items have been added to all of these instances.<br />
        * The following item sets have had their set bonuses adjusted: Valor, Magister's, Lightforge, Shadowcraft, Dreadmist, Devout, Wildheart, Beaststalker, and Elements.<br />
        * The locations of some of the waist, wrist, and hand slot pieces of the dungeon armor sets have been moved from their old creatures, including the Lightforge Gauntlets and the Magister's Boots. Additional creature types can also drop many of the previously difficult to obtain armor pieces.<br />
        * All of the hand slot items in the dungeon armor sets are now bind on equip. The Belt of Valor is also now bind on equip.<br />
        * Death's Head Judgement and Wolfrunner Shoes now have stats more appropriate for cloth wearers.<br />
        * The value of Health per 5 seconds items was re-evaluated and has been changed to be the same as Mana per 5 items. As a result most items that restore Health per 5 seconds will see an increase in effectiveness.<br />
        * Biznicks 247x127 Accurascope now only affects ranged attacks, and Elemental Sharpening Stones no longer will affect ranged weaponry. The schematic for the Accurascope will now drop once again in the Molten Core.<br />
        * Item use can no longer trigger the effect on the Five Thunders set or the Darkmoon Card: Blue Dragon trinket.<br />
        * The On Use ability on the Blade of Eternal Darkness has been changed to an On Equip triggered effect with a chance to occur on any damage spell.<br />
        * The Netherwind Regalia Set's instant cast spell bonus will no longer be consumed if the mage is not facing his or her target. In addition, the instant cast bonus will not be consumed if Presence of Mind is active; only Presence of Mind's effect will be consumed.<br />
        * The Lightning Shield bonus on the Ten Storms set will now work the same way as all other Lightning Shield auras, including increased damage from bonus spell damage effects.<br />
        * The tooltip on Thunderfury has been clarified to indicate that only the primary target will receive the slowing effect. In addition, the two effects have been broken down into two different debuffs to prevent incorrect information from appearing in the debuff tooltip for secondary targets (previously secondary targets were told they were slowed when they were not actually slowed).<br />
        * Wrath of Cenarius will now trigger off all damaging spells.<br />
        * The charges from the Zandalarian Hero Charm will now be consumed by melee and ranged abilities and spells which do non-physical damage. This includes: Hammer of Wrath, Judgement of Righteousness, Seal of Command, Judgement of Command, Volley, and Arcane Shot. The trinket will also now burn charges from each casting of a damage over time spell, heal over time spell, and area aura spells such as Blizzard and Consecration. Only one charge will be burned per area spell cast, rather than multiple charges per target hit as was previously the case.<br />
        * The Panther Hide Bag from High Priestess Arlokk will no longer take the place of other items. Instead, this item will now sometimes drop in addition to the normal loot.<br />
        * The following items were found to be more powerful than intended and have been tuned to be more in line with their level: Satyr's Bow, Inventor's Focal Sword, and Scepter of the Unholy.<br />
        * Green Whelp Armor no longer affects targets above level 50 and the sleep duration was reduced to 10 seconds.<br />
        * Many Recipes now have different icons. Recipe icons should correspond with the item color; a green-glowing scroll is a green recipe, and a blue-glowing scroll is a blue recipe, for example. As a reminder, white recipes can be purchased from a vendor somewhere in the world, so players should not pay too much for them at the Auction House.<br />
        * The Phantom Blade's effect will now prevent players from trying to become stealthed or invisible.<br />
        * The Luffa and Talisman of Ephemeral Power now have sell prices.<br />
        * The Crystal Force, Crystal Ward, and Oil of Immolation effects now have effect tooltips.<br />
        * The Royal Sceptre of Vek'lor has the proper spell hit chance instead of melee hit chance.<br />
        * The damage dealt by Demonic Rune and Dark Rune will no longer be affected by the user's increased spell damage items.<br />
        * The target of the Demon Forged Breastplate's effect no longer has to be in front of the wearer.<br />
        * The spell hit effect on the Felheart Robes is now properly listed as an On Equip effect.<br />
        * The Augural Shroud and Spidertank Oilrag now have stats more appropriate for cloth wearers.<br />
        * The Skeletal Guardian and Skeletal Berserker now drop loot appropriate to their non-elite status.<br />
        * Flavor items from the Stratholme postbox are now listed as poor quality.<br />
        * The Black Diamond and Pristine Black Diamond now stack to 20, the same as other gems.<br />
        * The tooltip of the Seeping Willow's effect has been reworded for clarity.<br />
        * The Chromatic Boots and Boots of the Fallen Hero have had their stats adjusted.<br />

<br />
Anyone else notice that all of the NEW servers are up, but none of the older servers with everyone's characters are?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Most of the servers are now online, but many of the older servers are still down (i.e. Lightning's Blade, Kargath, etc.) I check the realm status page every 10 minutes, hoping my server will be up. I'm less than 2 bars from level 25.</div></div><hr />
