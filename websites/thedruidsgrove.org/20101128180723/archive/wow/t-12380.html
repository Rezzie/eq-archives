Its seems that most of the time it is pretty good. But we just went to Void Reaver for the first time and I am trying to figure out how to increase it. <br />
I have the +2% threat on my T4 gloves. Would the +agility be better?<br />
<br />
Is TPS more a matter of attack rotation or gear?  <br />
<br />
As for attacks I usually open with FF, and lacerates at least 3, then maybe a mangle, and the other two lacertes, maul (assuming rage is high enough) then start back on lacerate, mangle and maul.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Keep 2%, maul is your rage dump.  It only gives you threat from the damage.<br />
<br />
- Mangle. You should always be using this if it is off cooldown.<br />
- Swipe. You should be using this if tanking more than 1 mob, as long as it doesn't screw up crowd control (sheep/etc).<br />
- Lacerate. This is for tanking one mob in a low damage/high armour situation (i.e. the mob has high armour or you're doing low damage to it because of lack of buffs or similar). The bleed part of lacerate is of almost no impact on threat. Lacerating just to keep up 5 stacks is not worth it.<br />
- Maul. As above, use when you have a lot of rage and don't use if you're rage starved a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">02-08-2008, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TPS for druids does seem rather gear-based in my experience (is for all tanking classes, really, which makes sense - as your DPSers gear up you need to generate more threat).  I'm not one to know all the math behind it, but I know that when I went from full clefthoof to 3+ pieces T4, I noticed a HUGE TPS gain from all the agility/str in the tier stuff.  That's the main reason I'm trying to get more T5.<br />
<br />
&lt;3 agi for threat gen, basically.  Mangle crits up our threat by a ton, and other crits as well.  Agi also gives ups our precious dodge.  So if you're looking for more TPS I'd suggest plugging more agi gems (4 agi/6 sta and 4 agi/+4 hit are my 2 current favorites) in your gear, getting some tier pieces, or even arena/PvP pieces, those have decent agi as well.  The badge rewards are awesome as well.<br />
<br />
+hit shouldn't be overlooked for threat gen, either.  I recommend at least 40 for your tanking set, more for kitty of course.  I'm running with around 50 right now in my tank set, and I'd like more, but I'm happy enough with the mix I have to not up it right now (kinda waiting for T5 kilt, that has some).<br />
<br />
Also, try opening up with a mangle + maul whenever possible, the combo of the 2 is great snap aggro.  <br />
<br />
It's also possible to change your gear slightly for fights like VR where you'll be offtanking partially, and the boss doesn't hit all that hard.  I get rid of some of my armor/sta for that fight, inserting a few DPS pieces that have tons of agi/+hit instead.  It helps I've found, also gives me more chances of dodging knockbacks.</div></div><hr />

Here's a great post that shows how AGI is better:<br />

I also think +15 agi is way better, since it's so nice for our dodge as well as our threat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">02-09-2008, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd rather have more crit, which means both more damage and more rage from Primal Fury, than a flat 2% threat increase. And wow, +agility also increases avoidance and gives some armor. At this point I'm not even sure why the threat enchant is in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kind of have a preference for it, but the last time I had a druid was tanking Zul'Gurub.  So I might be a bit behind the times on this one. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">opataris</div><div class="date">02-11-2008, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for your responses. You have convinced me that the agility enchant for gloves is better than threat. <br />
I also have come to realize that Void reaver reduced threat with his knockback. So if you continuosly try to hold aggro, you will continuosly get the knockback, and your TPS values will seem very low. Better to trade off with other tanks.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</div></div><hr />
