<br />
Then the same thing done with &quot;normal&quot; Druid heals.<br />
<br />
The goal being that a Druid who just nuked would be DPSing at the same rate they do currently, and a Druid who just healed would be healing at the same rate they do currently.<br />
<br />
But the Druid would be able to cast a DoT, then a heal, then a nuke, then a heal, then a nuke, etc would be able to have more throughput than they do currently.<br />
<br />
Spells that already have a long recast would be mostly left alone.  Spells that are neither DPS nor Healing (debuffs) would be left alone (but mixing them in would be slightly better).<br />
<br />
Then, if that doesn't go far enough... add in AAs that have Nukes/DoTs proc a +healing buff on the druid, and Heals proc a +Nuke/DoT buff on the druid, much like the current wizard instant-nukes can proc a +Nuke/DoT buff on themselves.<br />
<br />
The idea is that while a Druid would be limited to 75% of a Cleric burst healing at 80% efficiency and a mage without a pet when DPSing, having the Druid who tries to do both be 37% of a Cleric and half of a nuking mage doesn't seem that good of a deal.</div></div><hr />

I concur up until the red line, after it, not so much.<br />
<br />
While some druids may view the druid class as healers OR dps, I have always viewed the druids as healer AND dps.  Any situation where the druid is spending 100% of his time dpsing is a trivial situation, dps/healing concurrency is definetely worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Fernspur and NBW, in some extent, were changed/added to help address this problem.  But the combination of poor efficiency and poor resist check on NBW made the impractical.<br />
<br />
I support the idea, but mana issues can't be ignored.</div></div><hr />
