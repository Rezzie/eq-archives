I've gotten to 61 (or 62, since i hover 1 kill away from 62 and put 100% aa on, then die to go back to 61 whenever i want to do xp).  I need to start looking for call of tunare so i can do xp at higher levels, but the prices on anything from spectrals is quite high.  So, does anyone know of any good camps for cash?  Any tactic is fine (charm, rot, whatever) and i don't mind farming greens.  People have suggested tradeskill farming, but tradeskill items sell horribly on my server compared to what people say they get on other servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elysians in UP -- They drop a couple of nice items that you can sell in the bazaar (Death Mask, Death Watcher's Shroud), although drops can be sparse at times.  They usually drop 8-10pp per kill also.<br />
<br />
The Grey -- Rare cycle has a few good drops you can sell.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Scar -- Often a busy zone, but you can easily keep it clear in off hours.  Wyverns and/or Othmir drop quest gems, pelts and Crustacean Armor (low-priced twink gear).<br />
<br />
Sebilis -- Excellent gem drops.  I haven't actually tried soloing there since I got my new 62 DoT, but I'd imagine it's a little easeir now.<br />
<br />
Lots more if you do some digging I'm sure.<br />

<br />
3 pieces of advice:<br />
<br />
1 - Get a few levels<br />
2 - You have resists spells for all 5 lines of magic, use 'em =)<br />
3 - Swap in a few pieces of resist gear<br />
<br />
Fighting there at level 60 for a week or two (gathering 8th shawl gems), I think geonid shaman spells landed on me 3 or 4 times, total (out of many hundreds cast).  I had buffed resists all above 110 (poison and disease were the lowest, MR, CR, FR were all 150+).<br />
<br />
And yes, the cash loot was pretty nice, even if the XP was a bit slow.  But at least it wasn't green camping.<br />

I think any 60 druid with a reasonable mana pool can do these if they get the strategy down, and with our new Luclin spells (especially the 2k heal), these guys should be shamefully easy.</div></div><hr />

Snare, root, free DoTs, nuke, nuke, get summoned, back up, heal, nuke, nuke, get summoned, back up, heal, nuke ... ad nausium.  Viscid Roots (or even the SoL root ability whatever it's called) is a must for this type of solo.<br />
<br />
You will want your fast cast nukes up for this encounter (Breath of Karana, Scoriae, etc).<br />
<br />
Nice thing about corrupteds is that they like to summon you then cast a spell so their melee output is pretty low.  Bad thing about this encounter is that the corrupteds have their fast cast nukes up (Breath of Karana, Scoriae, etc).<br />
<br />
Corrupteds are level 58-59 druids.  So if you take one on, you're pretty much in for a shootout.  Risk of death is high, but a very fun fight.</div></div><hr />

Vendor the diamonds and raw diamonds, can find a tailor to sell the midnight stones to probably, and sell the BDs in the bazaar for a cheap price (500p on my server) to cultural smiths/tailors.<br />

If you get the tactic down right you can clear thru the whole camp solo with no down time .</div></div><hr />

They are charmable with Call of Karana (the lvl 52 charm), and can be single pulled with Harmony of Nature. The drop raw diamonds and diamonds reasonably frequently (150pp or so each to a vendor) and can even drop blue diamonds less commonly. They go light blue at level 63, but before that, the xp is good, and in 3-4 hours you can get 1k+ of gems easily.<br />

Disclaimer: its been a while since I have personally done this camp, so I don't know if the gem drop rate has been nerfed or anything.<br />

As I've since discovered, this is impossible since it takes so long to target the damn bone piles.  Anyway, the corrupted happened to be in there, and is immune to harmony!  Yay! So then I had 3 of them on me.  My resists weren't buffed, but I like to think they're pretty good in my normal gear.  At least my cold resist is.  Anyway it proceeded to land a scoriae for full, an ice for full, and then rooted me.  I tried running out of range, but I never got that far.  Kudos to the druids who have killed this guy.  I'd love to have the mask but I won't be going anywhere near the corrupted again anytime soon.  Unless you need the armor, the regular elysians are very poor for cash drops considering how long they take to kill.<br />
<br />
Nightstalkers--this place is camped 24/7...I think if you ever want to get this camp you will have to spam the login servers after a patch or maybe try logging at about 5 in the morning.  Edit:  I think it's beyond retarded that this camp drops so much cash compared to the other junk in PoN considering it's not any harder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menlaiene</div><div class="date">02-16-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of my friends farmed Plane of Growth regularly for cash, and from what I saw, it was quite possibly the best and easiest place to get pure cash loots that I have ever seen.  He said they got around 200-300 pp of cash and gems per kill.  Their typical group was a cleric, enchanter and monk, although sometimes others would go with them also.  They spent a few weeks farming PoG on a daily basis and went from coming back to EQ with almost no equipment and money to full suits of pog armor, buying kei and their other spells, upgrading equipment from other slots, and finally 30k left over in the bank.  <br />
<br />
PoG's advantage over say, nightstalkers, is that nightstalkers are always always &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; camped, much like any other mobs known to drop good cash...except pog.  People are scared of it for some reason, or they don't want the faction hits.  It's a big zone, enough to support a few groups, and it's almost always empty unless someone is clearing it to kill Tunare.  Major risk is it's rather out of the way so finding a cleric willing to come rez you is not going to be easy.<br />
<br />
I have no idea if a druid can solo there or not.  I've resisted the temptation because I want to get my gloves of earthcrafting someday and also because no matter how little I roleplay, something just feels terribly wrong about being kos to my own guildmaster.  It does tick me off incredibly how much cash drops from a place with not much risk compared to PoP, and I need money badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i know i coul dmake some good cash on donnations for ports and sow but i want to work for what i get if that means farming cash or items i will do it with my druid ... i use myu paldin as muscle for raids and such ... i love being a paladin but i find soloing with my druid to be more fun at times.<br />
<br />
i have gone from 34 to 38 in three days in IC ... i started to learn the quad skill in EW on the Ry'Gorr near the bridge ... then took my butt to the dock and have figured out how to double quad by agroing too many cats at once ... so now i intentionally go out snare 8 and round them up then AoE Nuke them till they die ... when i have them down to one cat left i switch to my single target dd and finish them off.<br />
<br />
The problem with this area is there is no cash .. the pelts are worthless ... and they don't drop cash.<br />

<br />
Once you get to the end of the Dragon Spine bridge, make a right and follow around that edge.  Once you get to the houses with the dorfs in them you'll know you're there.<br />
<br />
Keep on going and soon you'll come across some Ulthorks, Rhinos, and Walruses.  Those are the things you need to quad.  There are plenty of them so you'll have no problem dual-quadding them.  They have a couple more hps than the cougars, but with KEI there shouldn't be much of a problem.</div></div><hr />

I have all of my spells so far (except for that stupid beguile plants spell), and it's all been mainly from selling spiderling silks in bazaar up to lvl 24, selling Needlite drops up to lvl 28 or so, selling FS weapon drops from Gnolls in SK up to 34, and now selling bronze axes from dorfs in BB/velium blocks in CC/velium weapons/runes/words from the occational uthork/giant in EW.<br />

According to the April 23rd patch message:<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again. Beware.[/quote]<br />
Unless you can solo these you may not be able to do PoG alone.<br />
<br />
With regard to the Ulthorks. The Man o Wars spawn at the south shore. At 35- 39 you could be easily quad kiting Ulthork Hunters and walruses at the north shore then working up to the Ulthork Warriors. Then later going back to south shore for the Wan o Wars. If you prefer the south shore, try quadding the walruses there. They have much lower hp then the Man o Wars.<br />
