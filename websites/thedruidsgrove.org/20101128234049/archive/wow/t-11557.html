First this staff is bind on equip, so it can be sold. Which is impressive. But the stats do not appear to be worth the 250gold to 300 gold I see it sell for. Yes it is a purple epic weapon....BUT would anyone pay 250 gold just to have a epic weapon to brag about, even if it is inferior to weapons that cost 10 gold?<br />
What is your experience in WoW with item pricing. Why pay sky rocket prices for an epic weapon just because it is epic, it is not like rare coins or art that increase in price over the years.<br />
What's the deal with this staff?</div></div><hr />

For a level 35 twink it is a great item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you plan just leveling out don't even bother. Heck, if that dropped for me, I would sell it unless I was going to make a twink in that bracket in the future.</div></div><hr />
