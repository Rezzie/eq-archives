You'll have to forgive me, but I'm only recently making the transition from EQ to WoW, and changing communities (the Safehouse to the Druid's Grove), so I don't know most of you or perhaps as much as I should. Been playing a couple weeks, have a level 30 druid now on Laughing Skull, and am starting to see my leatherworking approach 200. But I'm missing a lot of recipes, and not merely the one's which are 'found'. Is there a site established for this game which details tradeskills like www.eqtraders.com used to, and would have which vendors carried which recipes?  Alla wasn't much help with that. Thanks</div></div><hr />

Wow professions don't require the same type of exploration that EQ ones did, at least at this point.<br />
<br />
Alla's does have the information but it's harder to find and for me pretty unwieldy for tradeskill recipes.  Thottbot does recipes better http://www.thottbot.com/ .  I use both sites fairly often somethings I like better on Alla's some on Thott.</div></div><hr />
