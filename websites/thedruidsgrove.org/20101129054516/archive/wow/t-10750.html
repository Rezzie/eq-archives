Free rage/energy FTW!!! <br />
<br />
Just my opinion feel free to toss my aside niner and tell it how it is :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">06-26-2006, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL @ Swearworld.  Thanks for the support.<br />
<br />
bam,<br />
<br />
I can see why you went the way you did, with the exception of Improved Healing Touch.  If you were raiding a lot, that's great, but still a 2.5 second heal is a LONG time to try to live to get that 2-3k heal off ( even with your improved interrupt ).<br />
<br />
There are 2 builds I see most often:<br />
14/32/5 ( pull a point from nature's focus and put it into Omen of Clarity, then 2 points into improve bash, and play with your other 4 points )<br />
<br />
0/30/21 ( feral to get the Heart of the Wild &amp; Rest to get Nature's Swiftness for a insta-heal ).<br />
<br />
The beneifts of each ( IMO ):<br />
14/32/5:<br />
- Pro: reduced mana shifting as you will shift a LOT<br />
- Pro: you hit harder<br />
- Pro: more mana<br />
- Pro: free spell / energy / rage from Omen of Clarity<br />
- Pro: Nature's Grasp<br />
<br />
0/30/21<br />
- Pro: Insta-Heal<br />
- Pro: Quicker Heals<br />
- Pro: better heals<br />
<br />
Now from personal experience:<br />
<br />
I've played both as 14/32/5 and 0/30/21, the larger mana cost to shift in 0/30/21 hurt a lot.  I missed Omen of Clarity, but I could live without it.  Nature's Grasp has saved my hide SO many times that it is really hard to give that up for 1 instant heal every 5 min ( or is it 6? ). <br />
<br />
PvP is all about survivability, and I do that by shifting and getting out of range to heal myself more often than not.  It's awesome to root, watch them trinket, cast nature's grasp and see them get stuck again.  All this while I run the flag back ( pvp set speed bonus is awesome! ) or keep my node secured while assistance arrives.<br />
<br />
On a side note - myself, another druid and 2 rogues single handedly took Tower Point, Frost Wolf, East &amp; West Frostwolf towers and the Relief Hut all while the rest of the offense was getting slown down at Galv.  It was awesome :)  <br />

*for those of you that don't know, I'm known as quite the emote spammer, especially in battle grounds.  When dying or killing I shower my target with the following as it just makes the honor grind a bit more tolerable:<br />

this was my build when I was doing the BG's heavily and very into my Druid. You can mix it up however you want in the first three tiers of Feral to get Feline Swiftness, Thick Hide, or Feral Instinct but I chose these because it suited my playstyle the best. Aside from that the rest of the tree is pretty much a no-brainer. NS was nice, when I had the 30/21 build, but in all honesty most times that I did use it I was dead shortly after anyways.</div></div><hr />

Buuut, it dont seem to work tho? I dont know if it should work while we're shifted, but I tried while in caster form and it just dont hit'em...<br />
<br />
Is this a bug for the 1.11 patch? Its kinda anoying...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">06-26-2006, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it all the time ( last night in fact ).<br />
<br />
Cast it ( while in caster ) - it's a buff on you that lasts 30 seconds or something like that.  If you don't have &quot;improve nature's grasp&quot; it is a very low probability that your opponent will get rooted.</div></div><hr />

When I played my first druid (2 years ago?) - you didnt have to cast the NG on yourself, it was always active if I dont remember correct ?:D<br />

Lasts 45 secs with a 1 minute cooldown; gives you a 35% chance to proc roots.<br />
<br />
Purchasing Improved Nature's Grasp gives you 15% / 30% / 45% / 65% added to the base percentage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah Shread is nice and all but 95% of the time after you punch someone with a 1000+ Ravage the first damn thing they do is turn and face you... heck when i PvP Shread isnt even on my cast bar since normally i use rake (or claw when i get an OOC proc) to build up fast combo points and then smack em with a FB <br />
<br />
Oh yeah and usually we take 3 rogues and 2 druids and go stealth gank all the towers and GYs while the raid is workin on Belinda hehe LOVE Ninja squad!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No?<br />
<br />
Lol. Learn to PvP tbh. :) Shred is awesome. A 48 energy backstab with feral druid AP is EXTREMELY good (the rogue equalent needs a 5 piece nightslayer build with 31 assassination - for 120 energy, and they dont even have OOC, they have relentless strikes - wich is not as good).<br />
<br />
If shred isn't even on your castbar, you suck tbh. :) learn to play pls. :)</div></div><hr />

Again it comes down to playstyle and what works for you, improved shred doesn't fit into my build.</div></div><hr />

I've never tried improved shred; if you have the improved pounce and improved shred, is it possible to get off a pounce+shred+shred before your target turns around (asumming they don't use their pvp trinket)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">07-12-2006, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about the timing part, but at 48 energy improved, just the &quot;shred+shred&quot; will take 96 energy, or a full bar, so it would only be possible if you got an OOC proc on the pounce or first shred.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or drink Thistle Tea.. erhm.. wait.. we can't do that. :p<br />
<br />
Anyway.. get an energycount-meter and attack just before the next evergy will tick and you usually have 20 more energy to play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-12-2006, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might be possible if you timed it right using a wolfshead helm and had 5/5 furor (when it works again):<br />
<br />
Pounce right before your energy tick, follow with shred, shift caster, shift cat, shred. Even then they would have to be slow to react, because stun from pounce only lasts two seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">07-12-2006, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I see shred as more of a PvE talent where someone else has aggro and you can position yourself and use it repeatedly for a while (like a long boss fight).</div></div><hr />

Running away = back to you, back to you = shred, shred = huge dmg, huge dmg = dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, making it an essential talent IMO for any instance and raiding, but not the same general applicability of Claw / Ferocious Bite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">07-12-2006, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frankly, I see shred as more of a PvE talent where someone else has aggro and you can position yourself and use it repeatedly for a while (like a long boss fight).<br />
<br />
It IS a PvE talent basically (only way for a feral druid to make a difference ffs).. but it's also totally useful in PvP..<br />
<br />
I always get surprised when I hear about druids trashing our no 1 talent in the feral tree (well ok, no 2 then.. HotW is better) in PvP. I use it all the time. <br />
<br />
KEL KEL KEEEEL that hordie.. Shred him in the back while his running!!! Shred that fvcker!  Make evil druid laugh. :D<br />
<br />
Also, remember.. having a 48 backstab makes you dont have to wait another tick for that shred to regen. You can always shred before any rogue can backstab. Think about it. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's in cat, full energy. He sneaks up, pounces and shreds....takes maybe 1sec total.<br />
<br />
If you click on the actual cat 'buff' you get no cool downs for shifting out, he clicks cat, hes right back in form and with furor enough to shred again.....<br />
<br />
So technically this works, now if the person has the skill to do it is a different story</div></div><hr />

Heh. Try it and make a report. :)<br />
<br />
I'm totally myself gonna try it now.. but I'm thinking I have to be REALLY fast with me hands. :/ And even if I could pull it off flawlessnly.. I wont be able to do it every time. :( :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">07-13-2006, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason it could work is because debuffing yourself from cat form doesnt initiate the global cooldown, just like removing any other buff in the game. But if you were to actually click on the cat shapeshift button to shift back to humanoid, you would get the global cooldown because you used a spell. <br />
<br />
I would try it but Im not feral so I dont have reduced cost of shred.</div></div><hr />
