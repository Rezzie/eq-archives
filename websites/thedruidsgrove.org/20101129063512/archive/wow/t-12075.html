I'm entering arenas (looks like 3v3) and would like to stick to feral.  Here's my spec as of typing this (may change due to my impulses):<br />
Talents:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?0000000000000000000005032021323221052  0125155500301000000000000<br />
As of late, noticing all the resto builds in arenas, I've been thinking of going more healy:<br />
<br />
Am I s...out of luck?  Should I go moonkin/resto if I wish to be halfway competitive for battlegrounds and arenas?<br />
<br />
OH WISE ONES, PLEASE GIVE ME SOME WISDOM!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-12-2007, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have yet to do PvP, but you shift quite often, correct?  If so, I would think that Imp MotW would be worthless compared to Natural Shapeshifter w/ Nature's Grasp.<br />
<br />
What about Feral Instinct?  Does improved stealth mater in PvP?  I know improved bear threat is worthless.  What about Primal Tenacity?  While 15% isn't all that great, its better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">10-12-2007, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imp mark is far too expensive for too little benefit IMO ( talent point wise )<br />
<br />
You'll want Primal tenacity if you go feral.  Resisting stuns &amp; fears is KEY in arena.<br />
<br />
For arena, here is a nice build if you go resto.  <br />

<br />
Ferals don't have a lot of burst dmg, so it can be hard to arena as feral, but it can be done if you are on top of your game and continually stun the healer with feral charge</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">10-12-2007, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo, a much better spec would be:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGMsfrRedioVxhz<br />
<br />
You could get full Primal Tenacity/Nature's Grasp if you take a point or two out of Survival of the Fittest or Predatory Instincts. But that's what I'd get, anyway, that spec.<br />
<br />
Feral can work in PvP, it just takes a lot of time and practice. I personally don't do arenas much (too lazy to find a 3v3 or 5v5, and the 2v2 is just something I do to fool around and have fun with my friend), wish I did though. But, I do know I do very well in 1v1, and that can carry over to arena if you practice enough at it. <br />
<br />
There's a handful of ferals out there with good ratings, but it takes the right composition (most of them do Druid + Rogue, Druid + Warrior, Druid + Frost Mage, and Druid + Druid... I've heard of Druid + Shadow Priest, too.)<br />
<br />
As far as resto and balance goes, balance has great potential and can be very good, but as it is... resto is our best PvP spec, arguably. A resto PvP spec would be...<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0zjZVMhoZVcIxcq0xsx<br />
<br />
I don't know Balance well enough to link a spec, however.<br />
<br />
Edit: Screwed up the resto spec. Forgot two point changes. Fixed.</div></div><hr />

Most of my damage comes from cat and in bear I can charge and stun.  My fellow guild druid who is balance seems to last longer and has more CC option.  Plus as balance he does more damage with spells; also the treants are a plus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canidbeast</div><div class="date">10-12-2007, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's strange...tried to linkup this spec, but didn't work:<br />

<br />
BUT, it sounds like this is a better build?:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?0000000000000000000005032021303221251  3125105503301000000000000<br />
<br />
IN the event of me evolving into a moonkin, these are the builds I'm looking at, the top one more healy:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?5003220125331342310000000000000000000  0000050551301001000000000<br />
<br />
and this one is tougher with some stealthyness<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
*shrugs* I like stealth.  It lets me have fun in alliance cities (I'm a Tauren) and I can sneak out of hairy situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm resto arena pvp spec'ed right now but yea, don't bother gettig ToL if you go resto.<br />
<br />
Most feral builds are alright too.<br />
<br />
ps. never ever pickup Imp. MotW... Furor is so much more beneficial</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I guess I'm screwed on the focus part &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
I choose the imp mark/gift 'cause it seemed like best for the group type of thing...but those are pve days, not pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">10-14-2007, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not too hard.<br />
<br />
Just remember to have all your DPS Focus Fire a target down fast and Cyclone does wonders. Just takes some experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-16-2007, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 70 in arenas, as feral you will want to get as much resilience as possible, and as much stamina as possible.<br />
I've played arenas on my druid since they came out and I've been in all 3 different formats.  You will need to look at your team makeup and decide what general role everyone is going to play, but as a general guide 2v2 is extremely technical, requiring lots of skill in micromanagement and ingenious second-guessing your enemies, 5v5 is all about focusing fire and knowing how to avoid dying when 5 enemies are doing their best to kill you, and 3v3 is a combination of these things.<br />
<br />
Beware of enemy druids.  They will put you to sleep at the first opportunity they see.  If you are fighting an enemy druid, sleep them before they sleep you.  If they move to caster form, you need to move to caster form too; spend your time CC'ing and healing until the enemy druid is neutralised.<br />
<br />
I disagree with the notion that ferals don't do good burst damage.  Ravage for me crits for well over 3k, usually I have a rogue or another druid stun the target first so I can maneuvre in behind for the coup de grace.  If I have a druid with me, they mangle immedietely following their pounce, so my moves are tiger's fury &gt; ravage &gt; shred, and again shred crits are enormous.  We're no pom-pyro mages but as with most things druidic we can still do it pretty well if you get set up right.<br />
<br />
As a rough guide, you will notice yourself getting owned less when you get 10k+ health and 150+ resilience.<br />

For PvP, nearly all the best gear to be had is acquired...PvPing (system works imo)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you should shoot for somewhere around 50-80 Hit rating--pretty sure it's 50ish, but I could be wrong. Helps on Bash (despite potential resists) and maim and whatnot. It's not guaranteed, but it's helpful nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

When a warlock is about to fear you, the last thing you want is for Maim to miss.. :&gt;<br />
