However, just because it falls in one section does not mean it does not fit into another one. For example, Timorous Deep - it is common procedure to quad here, but when it was busy it was easy to waste some time root/dotting those that were not in the normal accepted quad circuits. Also some zones obviously fall into multiple categories and where I thought it was warranted I listed them twice. For example, PoM - I listed in charm and in root/dot because it is very different areas of the zone. You can almost always make the assumption that if its quaddable, root/dot is just as appropriate. Ok, on to the lists!<br />

Disclaimer: This information is based on my findings and the information provided in this thread by others. I have personally tested every suggestion before posting it here. While I personally would rather group for fun many of us have schedules that make that difficult. When my son was born my life changed, but I was not wiling to give up Norrath entirely so I needed to find ways to keep it alive for me when I was unable to group inbetween diaper changes, feedings, and now &quot;Potty!! Potty!!&quot; runs. :P<br />

Edit: In order to save page views, we're moving many guides to thedruidsgrove.org, or will be once accesses are set up.

<br />
If you are still looking for mid-range spells (up to 58), then I strongly suggest the named cycle in Skyfire.  Druids can root-DoT any of the named cycle that doesn't summon, and most, if not all, will give you XP (only a few were green to me at 60).  Three weeks of soloing there (on and off), and I filled in 7 large holes in my spell book.   It is even MORE convenient now since we can pop up to the prime soloing area via winds of the north.  <br />
<br />
If you can team up with a single warrior of similar level, GO TO VELK'S.  A druid and a warrior can take on any spider.  I PL level 55-59 tanks there since the change.  They're all blue, no poison, and have good quest gem drops.   Just spike, regrowth and NS (or PoG, but my tanks like the extra regen for some reason), use your bracers/arms and epic to add to the damage a bit, and sit and watch while the warrior whacks away.  <br />
<br />
The big problem with Velk's is that the zone is now a mess.  Groups camping all over the place, some claiming half the spiders in the zone.  There were times this past week when there no spiders in the C'N'L section of Velk's at all.  In fact, when I was there with a small guild group, we pulled some kobolds from the Tents over while waiting for the respawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Primarily.  The VRs have over 5000 hp (more than the raptors), and if I remember correctly, tended to resist a bit more.   Thus, if raptors are marginal for you, VRs probably will require too much medding during the kite.  This also varies depending on your equipment, of course.<br />

Skyfire has up through and including level 58 spells.  I've gotten 3 Fist of Karana spells there.</div></div><hr />

Is the entrance to HS doable at 54? I'm gonna finish up my key this week and maybe check it out. I've seen it mentioned here and on the shammy board a good bit lately, so I have a feeling that it will probably be camped. )<br />

Is this solo? if so what are you doing? the pyre golem guards guarding the wings? And how do you take those nasty 2 possible HT's on zone in. =\ I saw a paladin soloing in HS once, oddly enough =).  I've also hit 57 and hit a wall. Something else thats doable- Solo in chardok. At 57 I can root/dot at the exit and axe wanderers as they come up. just have to stack a number of dots so that its dead before the next wanderer comes up. or charm a dog if its a wanderer. Root it before you charm it, buff it up, and just let it go crazy. The Aruspex are kinda annoying if you're root/dotting though.<br />

Stay in the opposite corner from the Roamer that you are NOT root/DoT killing. Then you can spread them out. At the level you can pull golems solo 57+ should be ok. YOu can easily take the 2 HTs. Just have regrowth up. Then keep the roamers on a timer and kill golems. Awsome exp. I would even say it's the best exp i've gotten in like 10 levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just make sure absolutely noone is there or will be there within the next 12 hours ^_^ *** CHECK calendars if it applies on your server<br />
<br />
Plane of Air : Isle 1 *only*.. there's around 10 or so &quot;a thunder spirit&quot; spawns there that are level 50 (don't summon) that you can root-dot semi-efficiently with epic.  I believe they have a chance of dropping normal PoA loot like Treant Tear (drool), White Satin Gloves, etc. Did it a few times, one or two haste belts dropped/rotted. I wanna tear :P<br />
<br />
Plane of Fear : Due to the extremely large amount of  close-together mobs and HIGH aggro, you must make sure to use invis at all time.  This is _only_ possible if a guild/group has broken fear near half-way already and HAS LEFT THE ZONE AND IS NOT COMING BACK (don't try this if they're still there heh).  [Rare occation, but it happens sometimes when people get tired halfway through i guess] - Fight / Pull to the SE corner.  Test your mobs' summonability before root/dotting (I rooted twice to do this)  -- Harmony is your friend.  I killed 11 gorgons, and 2 turmoil toads solo after my guild left and half of fear was still up.  I have no use for any verm armor, was just doing it for fun :)  Verm boots and flayed turmoilskin belt dropped.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Hate, Growth, or Mischief yet.. and I don't think I ever will.  I hate being summoned :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Planes soloing is easy as long as you are 58+  (preferably 60 ^_-) and have the epic.. <br />
<br />
<br />
The sirens in Siren's Grotto, down the 'well', are also fun to solo :)  They frequently drop velious BP gems, some bard instruments, and a few EB items... You need 150+ MR for this ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're as BORED as a TREE, you can try soloing summoning mobs (I AM BORED :P) I've tried three:<br />
<br />
- Kaiaren in Trakanon's Teeth, near Seb entrance. - Um, level 52 I believe.. Around 20k hp also, I think.. he was the first summoning npc i soloed, fun stuff.. used DS a lot =)<br />
<br />
- Andad Filla in South Ro near Innothule zone - Level 53, 32k hp.  He is tough :D  You *need* epic and fungi tunic for this, because MOST of your mana will be used on healing yourself... keep Regrowth and Fungi Tunic on at all times... keep him epic snared and rooted at all times as well.. try to keep tabs on the 10 sec delays between summoning.. when you think you're about to be summoned, STAND UP and RUN away from him.. you'll be summoned and will run abck to about where you were before.  Coldain ring (8) is a big help here, the more damage you can do to him while he's hitting you is better. <br />
<br />
- Misty Whatsherface in Lake Rathe near Arena zone- I think she's level 53+, 32k hp... I was going at her for awhile but had to zone :(<br />
<br />
I'm having trouble of thinking of new ideas for curing level 60 boredom, just recently been playing my bard :)<br />
<br />
&lt;--- thinking about trying Yeldema again -_-</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emelia Sunheart</div><div class="date">09-02-2001, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spawn time is either 6, 8, or 12 hours.  I believe it's 6  hours myself but have heard those two others.  And yes, a level 57 druid could definately do it.  However, at level 60, it takes me between 1 to 2 hours of efficiently root/dotting them (Wrath of Nature [epic], Drones of Doom [bracer], Winged Death only).  Oh, and don't ever attack &quot;a thunder spirit princess&quot; or &quot;Key Master&quot;  -- Unless you're good friends with a cleric :)<br />
<br />
BTW - The component for porting up to Plane of Air is &quot;Cloudy Stone of Veeshan&quot; or something like that.. about 200-250 pp from the Erudin Library at the top.  You'll need to ask around for a willing wizard to port up there.. also note you lose ALL buffs upon port in, but the port in area is completely safe.<br />
<br />
*** REMEMBER TO CHECK if there is a raid there or is going up there soon.  The NPCs on isle 1 have their keys to isle 2 and 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Othmir Warriors I can and do quad, but the faction is tedious to repair (we got KS'ed on KD last week, bah), many of them are green, and when CS is crowded it's just no fun (not that quadding is ever &quot;fun&quot;).<br />
<br />
My question is about LDCs and HS zone-in.<br />
<br />
I have done almost no hunting at all in SolB.  Where can I get info on the location of the LDCs and the best locations/methods for pulling/rotting?  How is the exp?<br />
<br />
I have hunted in HS with groups several times, and I just can't figure out how to solo the zone-in with those 2 wandering, HT'ing sepulchers (which are often no-exp green to me, as are several pyre golems, believe it or not, talk about an under-con).  So any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also, has anybody tried soloing in the Hole?  Seems undoable to me, since most of the stuff out front is green as grass, and the exp-giving mobs are just not accessible without a group.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions would also be most welcome.  By the way, I don't have my epic yet, so that might figure into strategy.<br />

You can safely bind at the zone out there to be able to get back pretty quick.  Froggy crowns sell easily for 1k for extra some cash.  A few greens, but mostly good xp blues.<br />
<br />
A tip for the king.  When he heals himself, the heal will often break root.  Right before he gets to the point where he starts to heal himself, put breath of ro on him for extra dot damage.  Then when he starts healing, nuke him a few times.  This will make him do a lot of healing.  Easy bailout if you get into trouble.<br />

If you don't have a epic, you can still do pretty good with fungi and manastone.<br />

Comments on previous posts:'<br />
Chardok - fine with the easy stuff, but some dispellers and gates are annoying, also will sometimes run into mobs besides myrm that summon.<br />
Air - don't do this, the inconvience of any raid needing keys is 10x worth any possible experience or loot (very very low chance)<br />

I've had the opportunity to solo in pretty much all of these places listed, its a real blast fighting in these places wehre most druids never attempt.  I tend to wear very high ac and hp gear because i love to fight in dungeons and places with much more danger than outdoor kiting.  Nice to see people here that have gone beyond the realm of outdoor kiting.<br />
<br />
-It's boring as hell, but if ur looking for straight exp, i highly recommend quading otters in CS.  I'm coming close to suicide soloing them though , hehe.  <br />
<br />
-Chardok and HS iz/oz are descent exp and are doable solo.  Watch those HT's upon entering HS, sometimes ull get lucky and the mobs will not aggro you immediately.  And in Chardok  the myrmidon and one other mob .. aruspice or aruspex ? one of the 2 can summon as well.  Good practice against summoning mobs tho  8)  It's nice to have high ac and hp items for these zones.  root/dot<br />
<br />
VL - if its not a total cluster**** of people u can easily solo spiders, they hit very weak  8) root/dot<br />
<br />
Kael - dunno if anyone mentioned this, but you can easily solo the nobles area at 57ish + and if they're camped or cleared, at 57 or 58 you can level pull the guards at the arena gate.  The senior guards can cast but just keep mr up and its no biggie.  I usually do this with my fellow druid friend if we go here, the giants can pound on ya hard  8(  root/dot<br />
<br />
Test out your animal charming skeelz in SG or WW!! Can be frustrating at times, but damn fun and hella powerful !! Can charm seahorses in SG and animals in ww.<br />
<br />
I've solo'd a few mobs just messin around in PoF before, but most of the time i do it with just a few others.  One night I pulled PoF with  1 grp of 6 of us and we cleared the entire plane, took soo long, but was a blast.   <br />
<br />
OOooo ! A few people mentioned PoA !! I had never thought about that, had no idea those could be solo'd only been there on guild raids. Very cool ~ <br />
<br />
Ligge, you mentioned PoM, i dont know anything about the plane, but you can actually solo some mobs there? that sounds like a lot of fun, could you post some info about that ? id like to try it if its possible, sounds like such a blast. <br />
<br />
I enjoy hunting mostly with my best eq friend, Eltalabrie - he's a lvl 59 druid(almost 60! yaaay!) like me - 2 druids make quite a surprising force, so if u've got fellow druid friends out there, try fighting with em, u can kick some serious ass.  And if you're beginning your dru epic, i highly recommend doing it with a fellow druid buddy, we did ours together mostly - was much easier.  <br />

Blah.<br />
<br />
Forest mobs, I clear them all in about 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Maze mobs, Soloable, but I find just when I'm about done with a rat another adds in.  And getting a rez in PoM is BRUTAL.<br />
<br />
Far faster/better is getting a melee partner (which on Xegony there are about 15 rogues bound up there) and clearing things out.  TW armour?  May as well not even consider it, unless you have a plethora of free time and enjoy racing for the &quot;alice&quot; section every 13 hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haggle</div><div class="date">12-13-2001, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the risk of crowding up a zone that I love so well I am gonna post on what I think is currently the best indoor zone for druid soloing, and that is chardok.  Since the changes to chardok the bulk of the spawns are now static and most of the summoning mobs have been moved quite abit inside the dungeon so the risk of pulling a summoning mob in the zone in tunnel, zone out tunnel, zone in castle area or the tunnel above the castle are fairly slight.  The thing that sets chardok apart from most other indoor zones for soloability is the ability to charm animals to do alot of your fighting for you.  Especially for the zone in an dzone out tunnels one in 2-3 mobs will be chodikais who can be charmed with call of karana and then used to fight another mob which you root.  After epic, dot bracer plus your friendly pet even a light blue pet will dependably finish off a solid blue without dying.  Then you invis and kill your now VERY hurt pet off with free dots and get xp for it too.  I find that I can usually keep 2 mobs free dotted/rooted while one of those mobs gets beat on by my pet.  If I used 1-2 winged deaths I can usually get one chokidai whelp to safely finish off 2 mobs, then invis, kill whelp/growler rinse repeat.  With potg/mask of the hunter/+ free dots and free regrowth you can do half of the castle easily or roughly 1 mob every 2 minutes maybe alil more or less.  The pathing in front of the castle is less than stellar so sometimes  your pets will run up the zone out tunnel if you work there but with some clever moving around you can avoid this.  Also if you know where to pull at 60 you can single pretty much every mob on the castle battlements with ease and can even pull the nameds that spawn there which dont summon and kill them too.   With a high lvl necro partner its even better xp, they can charm undead with reanimated partisans making the best pets and the 2 of you can just tear it up.  With a necro partner we cleared all 10 of the castle plus maybe 6-10 extra mobs every spawn cycle very consistently and made excellent xp.   If you dont have epic/free regrowth etc and arent lvl 60 using either the exit or zone in tunnel still works VERY well.   One of the keys to this approach is using our glamour of tunare animal tash spell to help you successfully charm pets and to always pull your pets to you with ensnare if your pet breaks root pet or back away and recharm.  Other key is to always keep rooted all mobs that arent pets as much as possible.  I even root my potential pets and just pull to them oftentimes for added safety.  I don't have extensive experience using this technique in sirens grotto but I imagine its very possible there as well.  I have even used druid charm in solb on the bats very successfully while soloing LDCs.  With their ability to stun mobs the bats tank pretty well and as long as your magic resist is reasonable you can easily resist their stun and recharm fairly easily.  One other fun place to indoor kite is the Venril Sathir Remains balcony in VS.  If you can break up the spawns near there it is pretty easy to keep 2-3 skeletons/dogs rooted and free dotted moving about on that very large balcony and is quite abit of fun.  Again add enchanter or necro partner for increased pet power.  The ramblings of a semibored indoor kiter ;)<br />

At 58, mostly blue and light blue.  The timeless golems are fairly low hps, but no drops.  The golems around the temple are PHers for a rare or two that have nice drops, but in the few hours I camped them, I never saw a rare, and they were all light blue to dark blue.  The shissars have another round of DoTs in hps, but easily soloable.  I just recommend that you have some permanent water breathing item such as a fishbone earring just in case.  About the time you go LD for one reason or another, your EB will wear off and leave you in a bad spot.&lt;G&gt;   Skeletons there are mostly dark blue as well, but tend to have higher hit points.  For the  most part, good experience, no drops unless you get lucky enough to have a named pop for you.<br />
<br />
You can also solo the beetle looking things in the back of Fungus Grove.  They do not assist each other at all and most are dark blue.  They used to drop spells pretty regularly, but since the drops were nerfed I have not been back but one time and had no spell drops at that point.  An easy hunt area though if you can find it uncamped.  With my epic aided DoTs, I was able to keep all but 1-2 of these beetle spawns cleared.  The biggest ones I never got a spell drop from, plenty of spell drops from the other 2 sizes though.</div></div><hr />

Get to the entrance to the outpost there and head out into the area with the mobs.  You can go straight out all the way to the back wall and that should get you close to them.  They are on the far side of the lake.  On one side are some bandits, on the other are mutants os some sort.  Sorry it has been a while and I cannot remember the exact names of the mobs.  Anyway, they are beetles looking things, but not called beetles...you will know them when you see them.  They have a rusty color to them.<br />
<br />
The small are light blue to to dark blue in con, the regular ones are all dark blue, and the big ones are all dark blue as well.  All cons are at 58.  Only difference that I could tell was the increment in hit points as they get bigger, and spell drops get worse as they get bigger, however this was only in a few times hunting them.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove is an indoor zone, so no SoW or other indoor spells can be cast.  Bad part is no form of the howler for me so no extra mana regen.  I would equate them to othmirs in hit points.  As mentioned, they do not assist each other and are non aggro until you attack them.  This makes for very easy soloing.  Root/DoT works very well on them, however like anything else, every now and then you will get a resister.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just looked it up, the beetle things are underbulks.</div></div><hr />

Underbulk Hatchlings, Small Underbulks, and Underbulks.  They con indiff, and can be single pulled at 60 for sure, probably lower.<br />
<br />
BUT, and I don't know if this is a recent nerf, but many of the Underbulks (the big ones) are completely resistant to changes in rate of movement.  And even the ones that do not give that message can't be snared, in my experience.  I have never once landed a single snare on a mature Underbulk in 8 total hours of hunting them, shrooms and dregs in groups.<br />
<br />
So you can solo the small ones for a bit, but as big ones spawn you are SOL (heh).<br />

You certainly dont need your epic, just a little time (keep form of howler up for mana regen) medding while they're ensnared. FM, w/ a fair mana pool, can only do 70% dmg through fist of karana.  Excellent exp and ok loot at 58.</div></div><hr />

Arena one I don't hunt on often, because Captain Bvellos can wander up that one and he summons. I wouldn't recommend that one.<br />

WL ramp is nice, make sure you take out the blue wanderer plus a green wanderer before you start pulling the nonwandering mobs.<br />

Actually I should have a copy at work, but I am out for a few weeks due to surgery and while I was out I had a home computer crash resulting in formatting being required.<br />

If you want to email it to me so I have a back up for sure that would be great, if not I should have it when I return to work after the holiday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treyna Pynecone</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I went from 58 to 59 and am now almost 60 soloing exclusively in Katta. I go down to the bank area where there are 6 guards on the floor and 1 at the top of the stairs. When I firts get there I root/dot the 2 in front of the bank (use 2 winged, 2 es vambs and 1 epic per with an assortment of roots if they break). After those I med up to 75, make sure I have KEI, PotC, and am in wolf form.... then I snare the 2 in front of the tavern/merchant bldg, then snare the 2 by the stairs, kite em in the middle (cuz pathing sucks) and in 7 or less FoK they are dead. I loot all the weapons and armor (excpet the shields and the no drop helm). Med up again, then when the 2 in front of the bank repop I run to the stairs, snare the one up top, then the 2 infront of the bank and kite them. So then I have a cycle of the 3 and then the 4. Of course, now I'm KOS so I hit myself wiht invis, go into the bank invis and behind the bank counter so I'm looking at the backs of the bankers, do my banking and stash all my looted weapons in the bank. BE SURE TO CAST INVIS AGAIN BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE BANK COUNTER. There are 4 Centurions inside the bank that will aggro you as soon as you hit the door.. if the spawns outside have popped, get ready to run then gate.<br />
<br />
I rinse, repeat everything for the second hour of my KEI.... when KEI wears off I go to ally merchants (usually Thurgadin) sell, bank and then get another KEI. I usually get it in Thurg or in Nexus/Bazaar.... always someone taking donations for KEI. Head back to Katta via TS and start over for another 3 hours.....  <br />
<br />
Now: what about faction? The guards in the bank area will go KOS on you. To restore that faction simple go upstairs and do the nathyn's guards cycle. They are positive Validus faction. Validus guards at the bank are positive Nathyns faction.<br />
<br />
Once I hit 60 and secure the level, I will change camps and go do Nathyns to restore my Validus faction so I can use merchants and such while I gain AA...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nothar</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the patch with the xp changes for higher level mobs i have found an AMAZING spot for exp for me at 59th.<br />
<br />
Namely the Sun Revenants in the Grey. The guys that spawn around the pool of water near the zone edge. These guys always spawn at level 55. They have a lot of HP's but i can solo 1 in about 6 mins using Epic, WD, and Bracer. With KEI, i have no downtime at all and can constant pull them. They are not very resistant at all, Snare lands almost always and Root usually hold for a long time.<br />
<br />
I get 1% of regular xp per 2 kills of these mobs (in 59th). This is far and away the best xp i have ever seen for being able to constant kill with relatively low risk.<br />
<br />
The downsides to this camp are that there are only around 7? or so that spawn around the pool and they are the mobs in the zone that can drop the Lucid Shard for the VT key, so sometimes members of your local uber guild will be camping them for the shards. Usually they wont mind you taking some of the spawns though if you offer to let them loot the shard if it drops though =)<br />
<br />
By doing this camp alone i am racing thru 59 and can get 1 yellow of regular XP in 59th in 2 hrs of constant fighting with KEI.<br />
<br />
Kind of hesitant to even post this spot since I want this camp to myself. =)<br />

<br />
yes he is pretty much MR but your dots will land on him, and since the snare has been removed from the epic....mana should not be a prob so just kite him around in an area that wont disturb others...why?...he can aggro off of you and kill someone medding real quick....<br />
<br />
or have 2 druids (like me and athin on the innoruuk server)stack dots on him and play tagteam...was no problem..SoE sure comes in handy if you feel the need to change spells, just run over the cliff and float down while you change them..he cant hit you.<br />
<br />
and as others have commented on you can harmony him...my technique is go inviss till i at the big rock and go overhead view zoom all the way back.  I have built a lot of aggro so i keep the big rock between me and the others and make sure i am still some bit away from the first spawn spot.<br />
<br />
there are 3 spawns in a row with one roamer...i wait till the roamer is far down the beach and harmony the center spawn...then snare or just piss off the closest one and pull him back down the beach.  Snare, root and dot...hes dead..time to do the next one.<br />
<br />
if you accidentally pull the herdleader move away quickly and egress as soon as possible so you dont kill anyone else the herdleader will just head back to his spawn spot and you invis up again and head back...nice exp lousy loot<br />

But there are no zelinaks in FG. The only mobs close to that spot are shiknar foragers on the long ramp. Also, elsewhere there are medium sized bugs suitable for root-rot.<br />
<br />
You should add a  Katta entry to the Root/Dot section. ~Nathyn's guards... laid back camp, easy to share spawns with other soloists, reasonable respawn rate.<br />
<br />
Under Plane of Mischief in Root/Dot you should add ~AiW 1 Grink (doesn't summon), Pansies in Forest (blue at 60, don't summon, no loot). Also, quadding pansies is doable but not worth the extra trouble. Can multi-root/rot pansies.<br />
<br />
Add Santus Seru under Root/Dot. ~Guards on elevated perimeter.</div></div><hr />

The other day I ported up with an enchanter to get her epic piece, I stayed around and soloed all the spirits then tried my hand at the princess.  She does summon, but it is every 20 seconds.  Just keep regen and NR up and you should be able to survive her hits.  250 max.  20 seconds is plenty of time to recast epic, bracer and WD.  Long fight but doable and fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also with the changes to harmony and the nerfs to hunting grounds over and over again I chose to no longer update or past on more than just general information anymore. So it got unlocked and it dropped :) <br />
<br />
Its going to be very hard for me to ever go back and update this as I am leveling on, but I am sure if someone wants to work on it we can get the edits implemented on the web site. I am just hesistant as I hate to give out a good secret hunting spot and then see it get whacked with the bat.</div></div><hr />
