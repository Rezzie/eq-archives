Any suggestions for an unuber druid? I have only 8 K hp  8 K mana buffed, I have been out of the game for about 17 months so maybe I am just rusty and dusty, but i have been getting killed every other kill I make. <br />

The xp isnt bad though, between 9-12 percent AAxp per kill.<br />
<br />
It might be better though to charm kill, same method as with the frogs in PoS. Just make sure to keep mobs snared when charm breaks, and the 10min Ensnare works pretty well :)</div></div><hr />

I found after glamor of tunare about 1 in 3 resist, 1 in 3 break within a tick, and the other 1 in 3 wouldnt last more than 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Of course that would all change with tier 2 charm and it's -15 resist mod.</div></div><hr />

Root rot was a great, miss them days.</div></div><hr />

Charm generally lasted long enough for mammoth and goblin to beat each other down to less than 20% health. Ensnare sticks on both and neither summons.<br />
<br />
I tried buffing a mammoth up to be my bodyguard ala &quot;Earl the Wonder Pig&quot; aka the exhausted bloodtusk in Crypt of Nadox from back in the day. It's possible to keep the mammoth on its feet with Karana's renewal now that OOC mana regen is our friend, but my impression is that serial charming for double kills yields faster experience since there is no shortage of mammoths.</div></div><hr />

Good xp if you can find it open, seems sipers is POF Tables pt2</div></div><hr />
