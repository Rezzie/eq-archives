This ability will slightly modify your base run speed. This modification does NOT stack with movement rate spell effects. <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like their class-based movement buffs are being continually marginalized, almost trivialized, by Innate Run Speed AAs?<br />
<br />
It was bad enough that two plate classes gained 'steed' AAs which allow them to travel almost DOUBLE the rate of speed granted by our best movement buffs. Further disappointing how that rate of speed could literally be bought with platinum by any of the remaining classes (or obtained for free, through bridles dropped by several luclin mobs).<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm oversensitive to this because it's part of a larger trend in which Druid abilities have been made available to other classes. For example, Teleportation (as a class attribute) has suffered decreased significance with the introduction of Nexus spires, PoK portals, Faithstones, and area-specific gate potions, in addition to existing items with gate procs.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is not about &quot;porting for plat&quot; -- but rather about class attributes. Being one of only two classes who could move people around was originally described on many occasions as part of our overall balance with other classes. Well, granting easier travel to other classes was good for the game perhaps, but nothing new was given to offset the loss of that 'niche' for the two porting classes. <br />
<br />
Another example was the implementation of Graveyards, which detracted from the significance of situational abilities such as evacuation (dru/wiz) and corpse summoning (nec/shd). These were rarely so vital that groups would seek out a class based purely on those abilities, and true it was only considered 'very desirable' in a few zones, but again they were benefits of convenience for those classes and those who'd group with them; a small part of their overall balance.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know, the game changes and evolves, yada yada. I'm just disappointed that some of our utility, which were repeatedly used by VI as an excuse to restrict us in other areas, have all but eroded away. Knowing our core attributes -- healing and damage-dealing -- would always be inferior to specialists in their respective roles, these other 'little things' were the mortar that bound those attribute bricks together for the Druid. <br />
<br />
Now with the game's current encounter and zone designs, along with a top-heavy 65th level population on most servers, players usually have the luxury of picking whomever they believe will fill a role &quot;best&quot; without regard for convenience -- which is now largely provided by the game itself rather than by players. So where does that leave the few classes for whom these conveniences were part of what made them special and balanced?<br />

<br />
And to answer your question, no, it doesn't bother me at all to have run speed 5 in the game, and I don't feel marginalized at all.   I can't think of anytime I got a group spot because of sow, and if I did, it would have been over 4 years ago.   Even if sow were important to have, groups wouldn't pick up a druid to get it for sow alone, they'd just get the buff independently.<br />
<br />
Seriously, it doesn't have a negative impact on my enjoyment of the game...in fact, if anything, it makes the game MORE enjoyable for me.</div></div><hr />

(&quot;yes, I said more faster....deal&quot;)<br />
<br />
It's not just Innate Run Speed though.  it is flexibility and ability for a group to move.<br />
<br />
The ability to get together with friends and &quot;find&quot; your niche/spot quickly.<br />
Was a convenience I know my friends appreciated.  Fungus Grove camped.<br />
Port to DSP and hit ME/Umbral.  Or maybe head to Velks.  Or even Seb.<br />
<br />
People used to ask in guild chat can anyone pick me up.  And granted this was an inconvence many a day.  It also was a quick and easy way to let shine through to your guildmates that yeah ya would do that little extra to support them.  <br />
<br />
Even outside the grouping aspect, it was a friendly thing to do.  A type of &quot;do something good for someone&quot; who would often do something nice for you back.<br />
<br />
This movement advantage DID add something to the class.<br />
This movement advantage has been severly diluted (POP zones all connecting to POT, POK Books, Wayfarer Stones, Innate Runspeed, Horses)<br />
As such the druid class has &quot;lost&quot; something as well.<br />
<br />
Much like the Warriors complained they &quot;lost&quot; ground as percentage wise thier hp advantage over knights shrunk and shrunk.</div></div><hr />

Run Speed just isn't a &quot;big&quot; issue and it makes the game SO much more enjoyable.  <br />
<br />
P.S. Don't bother with the &quot;well SOE giving you a level 65 / 500 AA / Time Geared character would ALSO make the game more enjoyable.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firemynd</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please tell me that you're not serious about complaining about people no longer constantly asking you for SoW buffs....<br />
<br />
Have never complained about that, and have never declined to SoW anyone who asked for it. That wasn't the point, though. I'm sure while a few clerics would sing hallelujah if rez stones were put in every zone and say how glad they are to not worry about being asked for rezzes, such would inarguably detract at least a small bit from the overall desirability of that class.<br />
<br />
Even if sow were important to have, groups wouldn't pick up a druid to get it for sow alone, they'd just get the buff independently.<br />
<br />
Apparently you did not understand-- this isn't about one specific buff being &quot;needed&quot; or important. It's about the convenience that a class brings to groups which they otherwise would not have, or would have in far lesser degree.<br />
<br />
Take the bard for example. Don't tell me you've never been with a bard and heard others express appreciation for how quickly the group can get around, even if it's just moving from point A-D to reach a hunting site in the same zone. Not because selo speed isn't acheivable in other ways (especially now), but because it's noticeably faster than most folks have means to travel. The same can no longer be said of spell-based movement such as SoW, and soon the boost from SoE will not be noticeably faster than 'most' characters can go.<br />
<br />
It's not just one utility or buff ... it's the general deterioration of that which contributes to class appeal/desirability. Of course, I don't expect anyone who mostly solos in 45-minute stints to fully relate to this.... :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and for the record, I did mention that these conveniences may have been good for the game, and I'll chime in with Chenier in saying I &lt;3 runspeed and can't wait for more. But even though runspeed, as an ability, is beneficial to all classes including ours, reducing the benefit other players perceive from any spell line is detriment to the desirability of classes who provided it. Druids already had concerns in this regard, because most of our utilities are shared with classes who *do* bring something unique to groups.<br />

<br />
However, I agree that it has diluted our utility, even if only in a very minor way. A simple solution, in my opinion, would be to allow the effects to stack, but I doubt SOE's willingness to go that route. <br />
<br />
I also have one other minor reservation about what further increases in innate run speed might imply: could this mean that the run speed of mobs in GoD will be significantly higher than most pre-GoD mobs?<br />

The problem is that in velious it was what, everyone had 100% runspeed, sow buffed it up to 55%? (iirc) Then luclin came and we got soe, 60%, and everyone else was bumped up to 27%. With PoP we got foe, which left us at 65%. Now with GoD the difference will be even less. (not including wolf spells, which are rarely used)<br />
<br />
add in horses and steeds and we lose all movement advantage.<br />
<br />
run speed was the one thing we were pretty much.. dare i say.. best at? id like to keep it that way, and was hoping wed get an upgrade in the new expansion that came in at around 75-80%, even if it was self only.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I know there have always been very fast mobs (there's a griffon in NK that will eat you alive if you are just sowed, name escapes me at the moment though). I was just wondering if the bump in innate run speed was an indication that such a phenomenon was going to become more prevalent in the new expansion. <br />

A large number of people want the ability to rez but they don't want the headaches to go along with it.  These type of people would LOVE a self only rez.  This way they can get their own experience back on a death but they don't have to worry about helping others.  Rez Machines in the graveyard work the same way, you can get an easy rez but you don't need to worry about the level 25 warrior in Permafrost sending you a tell because she died and NEEDS a rez.<br />
<br />
That's why Clerics don't really care if the ability gets pawned off right now.  It's a headache.  When I was playing, I'd get anywhere from 1 to 20 tells a night begging for a rez.  The range is pretty varied, I'd get anything from:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Excuse me sir, I died in xxx zone and would really like a rez if possible.  I completely understand if you're too busy or unable to help me right now but if you could help I would really appreciate it and be happy to donate 100pp&quot;<br />

Some nights it was an absolute nightmare.  A lot of people just didn't give a rats ass about you, they just wanted their freaking rez.  You weren't a person to these &quot;people&quot; (and I use that term loosely), you were simply a walking epic put on Norrath for their convenience.<br />
<br />
And has been said many times, and is very true, Rez is one of those things that all the other classes point to Clerics for and say that this gets Clerics groups.  It doesn't, it gets that Cleric tells from the rude level 25 warrior punk who demands you take 30 minutes out of your life to help him.  Much like porting was for Druids in the days of old.  In theory porting got Druids groups.  In actuality, it just got druids tells out of the blue.</div></div><hr />

I have noticed that the amout of druids have gone way down due to these added conveniences. Now all those peeps that want to two-box something can 2-box a chanter to sell kei or a cleric for rez. Now when I see a 65 druid it is usually a player that likes to play a druid not someone's bot that is users for buffs and a port. I always hated bot taxies.<br />
<br />
While it is true that SoE is taking aspects from our class and giving it to others. So far I do not see it as taking away from druids as much as taking away from bots.<br />

Every LDoN I go through I cast b9, FoE &gt; give a warning, &quot; If ya dont want SoE kill it now for sow&quot; and cast pack spirit. If there sow runs out mid addy its not my problem.</div></div><hr />

Put in a rez stone.   rez ability does not get me groups.   What the stinking graveyard did was get me 30+ tells a night asking me to come rez one of their group members at the graveyard.  graveyard not only hurt druids-it  hurt clerics too.  They should have just had the person pop into the graveyard with their corpse and give x amount of dollars to an NPC to get their rez while they were there. There is no reason to  have a cleric in the group for rez.   Just do /who all cleric 56 65 and send random cleric a tell.  I never went roleplay til after graveyard came out.   Now I have to to keep from going insane with all the tells for rezzes in graveyards.  Not for groups--just the rez.</div></div><hr />

It's part of the long history of EQ (and seemingly any MMOG's) deterioration and blurring of class lines.  Fact is that transportation/movement is always the first to fall, and in EQ that fall began years and years ago, with purchasable tboots, run aa's, horses, etc.<br />
<br />
To say that it's ok really isnt the point.  Master of Movement was our (second) definition (after Master of Transportation was handed over to wizzies), and that role is pretty much completely destroyed and irrelevant for 95% of the game.<br />
<br />
Lets put it another way...  Druids are such easy targets for these things but try something else...  Let *everyone* get AA Melee Haste...  stacks with everything, but doesnt increase the innate cap.  2AA for 5% up to a max of 50% (upped to 75% with GoD!).  Pretty soon nobody needs enchanter spell haste because people are at the haste cap with an item+aa.<br />
<br />
Such things are *not* good for the game as a whole, even though they provide a convenience benefit to the individual, they erode class roles.<br />

Yes, I do enjoy travelling quickly.  But really, that's the reason I made a druid in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Its just an inconvenience for us to have to run out reSoE and go back in when it fades or we die.

<br />
How about this AA:<br />
Magical Concentration.  Clickable AA buff.  2 points = 1 point of magical mana regeneration.  14 levels available.   Buff doesn't stack with kei.<br />
<br />
no one should have a problem with this right?<br />
After all, it reduces an inconvenience for players right?  ((IE Downtime instead of travel time))<br />
It's not something that adds power right?  ((After all like Sow you can buy a kei casting))<br />
It's not something that will take away from chanters getting groups right?<br />
((after all you can buy a kei))<br />
<br />
Now, at it's basic level.  whenever more classes get access to another set of skills, it reduces the appeal of the classes who already had them.<br />
It blurs the lines so to speak.<br />
<br />
Personally, this ties in to me with the healing thread on this forum.<br />
For YEARS, I've heard the arguement that druids dont need &quot;better heals&quot;<br />
because (a) thier vaunted utility (b) thier nuking (c) thier solo ability<br />
<br />
As expansion after expansion when you LOSE ground in (A) especially, and now with GOD familiars perhaps (b) and with the XP changes definately (c) you are left in a position where the original arguments against &quot;better heals&quot; are all smoke and mirrors.<br />
<br />
BTW Masters of movement once did matter.  I DO remember pre-pop one of the reasons clerics especially and others used against upgrading and adding TR was Druid's could port &amp; solo.<br />
<br />
The simple truth is the movement advantage of druids was probably the #1 reason I picked the class.  The ability to be faster than mobs, and travel around from place to place appealed tome.  if I was just starting the game right now, decent chance I wouldn't be a druid.</div></div><hr />

Druid speed buffs are still useful at the moment, giving a 25% or so upgrade over innate run 3.  With innate run 5 that advantage will drop to 10% which is a small advantage but there nonetheless.

Easy is relative; it's easier to PL a second-account druidbot to 39 than to earn 100k.  That's something I've been doing recently; I've needed a druidbot for ages, I just haven't got round to putting the work in until now.<br />
<br />
That'll enable me to sell my horse and my GVD and my mana batteries and my sow potions and all the other stuff I've been carrying around, saves me quite a bit of inventory space and I'll be glad to have the pp back.<br />
<br />
I suppose I'm saying that encouraging people to PL druidbots for the convenience value isn't the same as adding value to the druid class.</div></div><hr />

If clerics do not get groups at least in part due to the rez ability then why does a cleric get groups? Ohh, i see its the ubah melee dmg they do =/&lt;!-- / message --&gt; Healing&gt;A heal to fit every situation.   quick heal for enchanters, CH, HOT, group heal.   there is no reason to have a cleric for rez in POP.  Just wait for the corpse to pop to graveyard and then tell random cleric.  One will wind up coming to rez you.   I know--I used to get twenty to thirty of these requests a night.  That is why my cleric is now roleplay as well as my druid.   I am noones buff, rez or port ho.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
You dont have to worry about dragging the corpse to the cleric.  In fact back around level 55 we had a small group of friends take two groups into the hobgoblin caves.   I was healing one and my friends druid the other.   enchanter and MT both went LD--played from same house.  My group died, theirs evaced.    Before we could fight back to the caves with the group who had evaced, our bodies had popped at graveyard and been rezzed by a cleric from Omani who was sitting there with a click stick.  If you take a group into the planes and die, within 15 minutes your body will pop at graveyard and you can easily have a cleric waiting there to rez you.   This is much faster then having to fight back to corpses or having a rogue drag.  They need to just go the extra step further and put a rez NPC at every graveyard.  Or let shammies make rez potions for around 100 plat a shot.  Sow potions cost money, rez potions cost money=everyone buy them.  then people could send me tells to join groups instead of to come SOW, port or rez them.<br />
 <br />
Now note I was stating how graveyards have made rez not as much a factor.   In LDON rez is great.</div></div><hr />

I have to 100% agree with the original post.  Speed is what a huge portion of this class was about.  Allowing any of our movement line to stack with Innate run would be the best thing to ever hope for.  It defined us quick and deadly.  Dont see this then you are,  sorry  to say this &quot;little Stormwardens&quot; too new to the game to not see this impact. Quad kiting would be a druid only solo ability.  Only reasons wizards can do it is from a stolen speed ability by jboots and now with AA. AE snare with no movement enhancements, no wizard would dare, one resist and that'd be your ass because you'd never put enough distance between you and mob to snare it unless you wanted to snare yourself. would not see anyother class but bards solo'n unsnareable mobs other than maybe a chanter in the high end 60+ unless you are UBER.  I often say I can solo anything that does'nt summon may take an hour but i can do it.. I actually bought the 100k mount cause i got tired of being passed by running while OTM by people on seleos mounts. Now dont get me wrong i Like innate run only for INDOOR speed reasons and this only comes into play if i die on raid and get rezzed in non outdoor zone. I am in no way with you all harping for indoor versions of movement enhancements we are at home in the Outdoors we drawn strength from it and we are the masters of it only good thing they did was Karana's Rage for us IMO to redefine us as THE quad kiters.  Now i am not saying we have not gained in aspects.. but so has everyone.. the original point was about what we lost.. what would be the harm in letting it stack with innate run.. that we would be faster AGAIN that our buffs would be wanted again. think of it this way just to put it as a loss to EVERYONE to try and bring a point.. what's the point of spending all those AA on something that any noob can buy a potion for and be the same speed as you. why should'nt a 65 warrior with Innate run 5 be able to outrun a lvl 1 with sow ESpecially if the warrior had sow as well?!?!? This was a VERY class defining buff as is thru the anals of post thru the years about how overpowering it was and now not a peep about it cause it has been stripped and handed to everyone thru all means..  The rants and whining about giving buffs... STFU learn to say no if your busy or you dont feel like it.. if he takes offense and demands something from you which you dont hesitate to post on here you dont owe anyone anything, just tell em sorry and if they give ya more crap /ignore or first if ya like to be the one to say the last word like me you reply &quot;well that just earned you a forever status on the no buffie list good bye /ignore&quot;  <br />
  Next thing they will do is give wizards a 5 min or longer snare cause all of them complain that their's is too short a duration compared to our lvl 29 10 min snare and then for that matter just hand it out to every class and get entangling weeds or snare.. and sheesh you can get that effect off items. I go back to quading because i am an EVO druid.. was quad kiting in HoH at lvl 60 for one reason alone.. 10 min snare i now lead AE groups with 5 wizzys or a mixture of wizzy druids indoor or outdoors why.. 10 min snare and &gt; than nuke aggro can hold aggro easily on 12+ mobs and if 1 splits.. snare, boom he wants me again. take this away you might not here a new druid complain do to like some people have said not many bot druids out there anymore. but having a ranger/druid in groups to snare the bish before he flees into agrro range of all his buddys or even before that point.. because seems new mentality is NEVER to pull with snare.. I personally think this is a long lost art.  I have taken the role of Enchanter in most groups when there was a shammy.. and if chanter was in group as well the love me cause they get to do one thing they never get to do in most groups.. NUKE better to have ANY mob moving 65% slower other than pathing it back to pull site and bet your ass he was snared before tank laid first hit on him. came from luclin i think mainly due to the fact that aggro lvls stayed the same for spells but the aggro gaining ability of average melee on mobs that where now alot harder to kill and hit alot harder to try and peel aggro off was more effort than the new age of EQ players.  Pull with snare.. you get an add.. snare it too snare again and now 1 can be peeled away or rooted without worry of training your group no matter how many adds.. Immune no worries we are still the faster than all but 1 class and will still have aggro while ya run in circles.  You keep letting  abilities our ours get scattered thru all then what i like to call a Jack of All Trades, MASTER of ALL class then we will truly lose all Identity. Again I will restate i am fine with Innate run 5 just let it stack off that vs base speed. all other buffs do.. as brought up by others.. Oh and my favorite about convenience.. can tell you have never riden a boat.  Stripping class abilities for convience is a piss poor reason and i am not just refering to druids.<br />
tired,, and think i am rambling.  Think about it keep it up and you will have 6 man groups of just warriors cause none of the other classes will be needed</div></div><hr />

Thats silly.  You choose to limit your movement extra.  Rebind in POK as you go xping every day and before a time raid outside POT.  Hell I do that on my druid.   I mean god your arguement about &quot;having to be bound outside time&quot;<br />
is so bad, its like a druid arguing but we need a better spam heal at 65 because were using Natures Touch since we don't like Natures Infusion.<br />

Secondly, I'm willing to bet that MANY times you don't notice SoW fade.<br />

I am well aware Shamans get SoW at lvl 9 and always have.. 5 levels before druids.. so how's that bursting my bubble? did you bother to even read what you quoted? no where In the quote is sow mentioned.. nor in the whole post was it said that this was a druid only ability. Speed was the issue.. and if it makes you feel better I was in no way implying that only druid movement spells should benefit from stacking on Innate run. And I highly doubt any shaman would have a gripe about that as well.  Granted I have never played a shaman so I have no ideas what kinda tell hell they get begging for buffs but from what i have personally seen last thing ever asked for was a SoW.<br />
My post was about a class defining ability,  shamans have movement buffs yes, but they use it to catch and engage and tank, where as druids kite.  The part you did include quick and deadly.. sorry did not add onto that&quot; and move the hell outta the way&quot;.  I think that would of cleared that up for you to where you would not have bothered to mentioned shamans in a post about losing defining characteristics of our class.</div></div><hr />

You could well argue right from the start that movement was Defining Druid category over Shaman.  Druids got(and still have) faster movement spells via Wolf form<br />
and Soe/flight of Eagles.  We also had unique line of Movement + Attack buff.<br />
((Bah Li didn't exist till Luclin))<br />

To me, defining movement spells were never based on who got them first, but who was best.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I notice all the time and have had people call me on it when I was leading a group somewhere.  There is a noticable difference between SoE/FoE/Run3.

Why?  Cause they all got the spell Spirit of Wolf.  I then poured over the spells for those classes some more and decided, hey! druids get ports. That settled it for me....ports and SoW.  <br />

Granted this was after my first character, a ranger, did the ole fall off Kelethin and attack the GM routine. And also after I made a warrior in Qeynos, which I hated, the warrior not Qeynos.

<br />
A friend who got me started on EQ suggested the druid class.  I didn't even look at other classes before I made Arienne.  As I worked my way through levels (almost totally solo to about 45) I found more and more that I had taken the best class out there.  I could get around and solo and everyone else was stuck trying to find SoW potions and waiting for boats or begging for a port.  And I could actually provide HELP to others with my class spells (that's a good feeling).  I remember reading forums early in the game and the number one complaint on EVERY board was travel and the time it took to get around Norrath.<br />
<br />
Well, since then I have tried a few other classes have never found another that I wanted to live with as a main character.  I don't know that I feel &quot;cheapened&quot; by the fact that druids are no longer the premier class for transport. Wizzies replaced us in a single expansion and have been widening the gap ever since.  But with all the transport bots out there (books, amulets, potions and Wayfarers) even the wizards aren't being sought for transportation as much as they used to be.  At least they have left us with some flexibility to solo, and we still can get places a little faster than others.  The whole game has changed and I don't think that many classes are what they started out to be.  <br />
<br />
Sadly, every time we see class &quot;specialties&quot; or prime skills given out to others, I see EQ enthusiasm of the longer term players wane, but it's a double edged sword because it also helps make all the classes more playable.  Kinda takes the &quot;tough love&quot; out of playing any character class now.<br />
<br />
And on another note (omigod, thread topic stuff here)... wouldn't it be wonderful if AA run speed stacked with SoW/SoE?  Just as haste items, mana regen AAs and an assortment of other features do.  I have never minded buffing strangers (for free, you dolts!) as long as they are nearby and civil to me.  :)</div></div><hr />

You know what's funny, I've never gone anon and even before PoK I very rarely got asked for ports.  Now if I wasn't busy, I'd port people but if I was busy, I would jsut say &quot;sorry busy.&quot;  Only once did someone get pissed and I told that person I'd make a point in my life never to port them. I never really did mind buffing or porting people, even now, unless I'm doing something.  That's just me though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giving all 51+ characters free access to what was essentially 'built-in' SoW didn't really make classes more playable; it simply further marginalized an advantage that a few specific classes previously had over others. (Reason I say 'further' -- Even before AAs and horses, all classes already had access to jboots, tboots, and sow potions.) <br />
<br />
Why have these new marginalizations affected us more than others? Part of the druid's class balance was its abilities to get away quickly and to escape. This was evident in design, not only by the druid gaining all lines of &quot;movement&quot; spells, but seeing continued advancement in each. Other SoW-casting classes only received one or two lines of movement spells, with lesser advancement in each.<br />
<br />
While giving other classes access to travel conveniences, SOE gave us ways of enhancing our 'port' advantage -- exodus and quick evac. My gripe is that they did nothing to maintain our 'movement' advantage, and in fact a couple other classes (knights) actually leapfrogged ahead of us in outdoor travel.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, as other classes edge closer to our 'old' spell-based run speeds, there should be druid AAs to retain somewhat of an incremental advantage.<br />
<br />
Soul of the Wolf: movement modifier (i.e. stacks with sow, soe, etc).<br />
- Passive, innate.<br />
- Target, self only.<br />
- Ranks 1 to 3, for +5, +10, +20%.<br />
<br />
Soul of the Cheetah: movement modifier (i.e. stacks with sow, soe, etc).<br />
- Activated, hotkey.<br />
- Target, group.<br />
- Duration 60 seconds.<br />
- Refresh timer 15 minutes.<br />
- Ranks 1 to 3, for +50, +60, +70%.<br />
<br />
Spell: Earthen Affinity: +30 movement modifier added to each target's own innate runspeed, indoor only, does not stack with spells.<br />
- Level 51<br />
- Targetable group buff.<br />
- Duration 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
These abilities would not be overpowering, but would serve to maintain a slight lead in what has traditionally been a specialty of the druid class. <br />

Did shadowknights &quot;give up&quot; their harm touch to get a superfast mount? What did other classes &quot;give up&quot; to get runspeed AAs, a.k.a. built-in SoW? <br />
<br />
Why is it, when it comes to the DRUID class, people always ask us what we're willing to &quot;give up&quot; to maintain balance after our abilities are distributed to other classes?<br />
<br />
We didn't get better healing as a gift. We got it because the game's higher level mob HP and DPS had inflated for quite a while without druids keeping pace whatsoever; a percentage heal was introduced as a step towards restoring balance. When the level cap increased from 60 to 65, we received upgrades to our healing lines just like the other two priest classes received, and upgrades to our nukes just like every other nuking class received.<br />
<br />
Please stop with this &quot;druids had to give up their travel edge to get better healing&quot; notion -- it's complete nonsense.<br />

By that logic, since clerics aren't always available and people need to be able to get rezzed .... and since chanters aren't always available and people need to be able to keep up their mana regen ... and since tanks aren't always available and people need to be able to take some hits... <br />

See where you're going with that train of thought?<br />
<br />
If mobs were designed to run noticeably faster in this expansion, that would have been a grouping boon for classes capable of increasing movement.<br />
<br />
I like my innate runspeed AAs as much as the next person, but there is something to be said for maintaining SOME element of distinction between classes in this game of ever-blurring class lines where so many abilities are shared among casters with each other and with hybrids and even with meleers to a degree through clickies.<br />
<br />
While I wouldn't deprive other classes of faster movement, I do believe Sony's devs should have made provision for druids to maintain some sort of advantage. That is all.<br />

<br />
I assume we all know that Sony is just making this up as they go along with only the barest tokens to actual design, forethought, or balance.  The Vision--as much as it sucked--is dead, it is *gone*, and the only extent to which any of the classes' gamewide abilities are thought out is the same extent to which the designer du jour thinks he/she remembers how things worked when he/she actually played the game.<br />
<br />
Do you think there is a document that describes the Druid's planned role in Gates of Discord (maybe an email...maybe), a follow up report on how well the new spells/abilities are implementing that role (probably due as soon as they finish testing--ah, right, we've already released...), a study of the interaction Druids will have with various classes during play (but they solo, right?) or a study of how Druids new abilities will impact past expansions (they'll be easier, duh!)?  And if you *do* think such documents exist in some formal state, do you think they were written *before* or *after* that neat little faster teleport AA was floated to the communities?<br />
<br />
Ha.  <br />
<br />
Let me describe to you the apparent method of current design used by EverQuest's designers:  holistic intuition.  I leave it as an excerise to the reader to describe the expected outcome of repeated interations of holistic intuition, but it's probably pretty obvious that my opinion is that it starts with a S, ends with a T, and is spelled C-R-A-P.  <br />

as a cleric, I agree.   I like the runspeeds because I dont always have potions available as in CR.   What would be nice is for run speed to stack with SOE or SOW.   Get close to bard speed from the two.   I would definitly like this idea and I think almost any class would.   and make it so it could not be made with alchemy to stack.  ie only the cast version would stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was bad enough that two plate classes gained 'steed' AAs which allow them to travel almost DOUBLE the rate of speed granted by our best movement buffs. Further disappointing how that rate of speed could literally be bought with platinum by any of the remaining classes (or obtained for free, through bridles dropped by several luclin mobs).<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm oversensitive to this because it's part of a larger trend in which Druid abilities have been made available to other classes. For example, Teleportation (as a class attribute) has suffered decreased significance with the introduction of Nexus spires, PoK portals, Faithstones, and area-specific gate potions, in addition to existing items with gate procs.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is not about &quot;porting for plat&quot; -- but rather about class attributes. Being one of only two classes who could move people around was originally described on many occasions as part of our overall balance with other classes. Well, granting easier travel to other classes was good for the game perhaps, but nothing new was given to offset the loss of that 'niche' for the two porting classes. <br />
<br />
Another example was the implementation of Graveyards, which detracted from the significance of situational abilities such as evacuation (dru/wiz) and corpse summoning (nec/shd). These were rarely so vital that groups would seek out a class based purely on those abilities, and true it was only considered 'very desirable' in a few zones, but again they were benefits of convenience for those classes and those who'd group with them; a small part of their overall balance.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know, the game changes and evolves, yada yada. I'm just disappointed that some of our utility, which were repeatedly used by VI as an excuse to restrict us in other areas, have all but eroded away. Knowing our core attributes -- healing and damage-dealing -- would always be inferior to specialists in their respective roles, these other 'little things' were the mortar that bound those attribute bricks together for the Druid. <br />
<br />
Now with the game's current encounter and zone designs, along with a top-heavy 65th level population on most servers, players usually have the luxury of picking whomever they believe will fill a role &quot;best&quot; without regard for convenience -- which is now largely provided by the game itself rather than by players. So where does that leave the few classes for whom these conveniences were part of what made them special and balanced?<br />
<br />
~Firemynd<br />
<br />
First off I did not read this entire thread so if I repeat points already made please forgive the slight.<br />
<br />
You are comparing AA abilities that you can not get until after level 51 with a spell ability we get at level 14, sorry but that's not much in the way of a realistic comparison.  ANYTHING that cuts down on the random tells from folks mooching sows, othe buffs, or ports is a good thing which brings me to my next point....<br />
<br />
The PoK travel system is an absolute god send, I never ran a druid to be a taxi service.  People can get where they want to go and I no longer need feel that my game has been interupted or infringed upon by others.<br />
<br />
It's all well and good to point fingers at the &quot;graveyard system&quot; but sometimes finding a rez or a summon corpse is simply not possible, the graveyards at least solve the need for CR and would you really want to deal with the trains caused by naked toons as they frantically try to drag their corpses clear?<br />
<br />
You see this as the glass is half empty, I see it as me drinking the first half and realizing it's not nearly as bitter as you've made it out to be.  I look foward to the remainder and remain secure in the knowledge that I can finish it without having to be ANON to avoid random tells from people that think ports and buffs are all I'm here for.</div></div><hr />

I personally could care less if other classes can run fast or have the ability to easily move from zone to zone via PoK books and in fact I wish there were a few more PoK books to cover the zones which are still inconvenient to get to.<br />

<br />
That's all fine and dandy.  But the fact of the matter is that SOE and Verant before them did indeed define the druid with movement and porting spells as an integral part of class balance.  Countless times these abilities were used as explanations for the denial of other changes, and the fact is, since speed and ports are now available to all classes, we've gained no new abilities to make up for them, nor have we even received improved verisions of our existing movement and porting abilities.<br />
<br />
The current devs no doubt believe as you do, that druids (and wizards by extension) dont need compensation.  But that flies in the face of what previous generations of devs have said and done regarding our integral abilities and how they define us as a class and relative to other classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 10% of the time we don't (i.e., when we have enough people in the group that there's no room for my druid), the travel ability of the druid IS noticable.<br />
<br />
Yes, there's PoK, but it's a nice, noticable convience that we can port out of a LDoN dungeon right to PoK when we're finished. It's really convenient being able to succor across zones (yes, I have my holy steed but that's ONLY good when I'm alone - otherwise I get to the destination and get to wait for 5-10 minutes for everyone else to get there).<br />
<br />
Having SoE or even SoW is a damn noticable improvement to run speed. I do recall cursing when sow dropped about 10 seconds after entering Netherbain lair - it takes noticable longer to traverse it without SoW or SoE. (I too hate the bobbing of SOE, but still use it or FoE for the additional speed.)<br />
<br />
There are constantly druids porting for donations in PoK... in PoK. For those of us who can't bind and gate, travel is still greatly eased by having a druid or wizard around.<br />
<br />
I have to comment on the basic rationale of the post. First, let me say I can understand why the changes might have a negative emotional impact. However, on logical grounds, the argument isn't rational. The fact that the game was &quot;orginally&quot; a certain way is not an argument at all that it should remain that way (it's the &quot;genetic fallacy&quot;). If you stripped away ports and sow from druids, they were still one of the most powerful classes pre-Kunark. Further, travel for everyone else was too burdensome - one of the first time sinks (though it at least did give you the impression of the size of the world).<br />
<br />
In other words, the game has improved for the most part due to things like innate run speed and the PoK stones. (You can make an argument that the game was &quot;better&quot; without them, but since we're talking a subjective measure you have to take into account that most people certainly seem to enjoy it more now than then, due to those aspects.) Adding soulbinders was another case of &quot;watering down&quot; the game by giving PC abilities to NPC's - but I can barely express what a positive change that was.<br />
<br />
Play balance should be based on how effective a class helps their group to be, not on how convenient some aspects become. <br />
<br />
That being said, allowing movement buffs to stack - at least in some fashion - with movement AA's would have been a nice thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree.  Yet is was  never that way in EQ.  Convenience classes paid for those abilities by being less powerful in other aspects.  Being able to sow/port doesnt allow your group to kill faster, yet that was a huge factor impeding attempts to give the druid class some group value.<br />
<br />
I think even Brad McQuaid would even agree now that it was a mistake to equate travel convenience with group value.  I remember very clearly the horror stories we had here on the grove in the old days, of druids being invited to groups, porting the group to the destination, then being disbanded once they landed.  But the fact is we simply didnt have a lot to add to a group back then that some other class couldnt do much, much better.  And this is still true today.  So while we are much better in a group than we once were thanks to the efforts of various people here, we are *still* paying for the convenience of ports/sow in the minds of the devs and players, and still have absolutely zero unique abilities to show for what was given away in the form of PoK stones and Run3/4/5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A lot of these type of abilities don&#8217;t have a direct impact on kill speed, but they do have an indirect impact.<br />
<br />
In LDoN for example a group finishing an adventure with a druid in the group can port straight to S Ro, and quickly get transferred to the appropriate adventure camp.  It saves some time running and gives more time killing so it will increase the group xp.  If a SoW allows someone to run away without dying then it saves the group downtime and hence means more time for killing.  An evac in the right circumstances can save a huge amount of downtime, leading to more xp.<br />
<br />
Rezzing falls into the same category.  It wont directly lead to faster kills, but by getting the group moving after a death much quicker it means more time for killing (on top of the actual xp given back).  Hitpoint buffs don&#8217;t directly lead to faster killing, but again less dying = more time killing.<br />
<br />
For most of these abilities it is impossible to quantify just how much extra killing the group gets to do, but there is some benefit to them.  Some of the time they may have no value (e.g. evaccing ability when the group never wipes) but potential value is still useful.  No xp group is risk free to negate these abilities entirely &#8211; I&#8217;ve been in a PoTime group slumming in normal LDoN that would have wiped but for an evac (gater brought back a dozen or more mobs).</div></div><hr />
