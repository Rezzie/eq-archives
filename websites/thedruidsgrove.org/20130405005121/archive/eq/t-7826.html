<br />
Cant Type, Cant move, cant do anything except things that can be done by mouse.<br />
<br />
Port out of it, HELL NO, just makes you stuck somewhere else.<br />
<br />
5 times yesterday I got stuck.<br />
<br />
You would think, they could get this fixed, I am by no means the only person in the Stuck Charater room everyday. <br />
<br />
CoH is looking better and better.</div></div><hr />

When these problems are happening months after it was let out - these are the kinds of things you see in games a month or two old.<br />
<br />
I do suggest, though, that you wait 30 secs and try /rewind.<br />
<br />
I get stuck about 10 times a playsession, and generally rewind fixes me.  Generally.  (unless you zone in stuck, which sucks majorly).</div></div><hr />

I get stuck in dungeons and doorways and can't get out.  sometimes /rewind helps.   I lock up in PoK and have to hard reboot my system since I can't type /rewind or anything else.</div></div><hr />

Usually if I forget to reboot before I log in, I will invariably lock up at least once if not twice or three times. <br />
<br />
With the hard lock up, if you ctrl alt delete, sometimes you can actually end the task and get out of eq without having to do the hard reboot.  Most times the mouse won't release so you will have to tab down to &quot;end task&quot; press space to say &quot;yes I want to end this stinking program&quot;.<br />
<br />
Even if you successfully get eq shut down, I would suggest rebooting still or shutting down completly for a minute or two.  Apparently this helps with clearing out the RAM.</div></div><hr />

I don't turn my head and go afk while running somewhere and run into trees and stuff to put myself in that position.  As far as the POK lockup bug.  I have started tuning clip plane down to about 20% before i go in and turn in back up once i get out and havn't locked up since.  You guys might try that see if it works for you.</div></div><hr />
