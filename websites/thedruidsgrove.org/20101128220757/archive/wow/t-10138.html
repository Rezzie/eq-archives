It can be things gotten off monsters, found in chests, lockboxes, or fished.. but it can't be quest rewards, things you bought off the AH, etc.<br />
<br />
I've found a total of only 1 Epic on random world drops and I'm almost lvl 60</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jeweled Amulet of Cainwyn in UBRS, lost the roll.<br />
Destiny in Strat, lost the roll.<br />
Robes of Insight, sold for 80g<br />
Glowing Brightwood Staff, lost the roll to a priest who had been grouping with me and my friend for about half an hour. Beforehand, my friend and I had agreed to sell all epics and split the profits, or if we wanted to equip it, we'd reimburse the other with the balance of the price we could sell it for. This priest got it and hearthed. Two hours later I found it on the AH for 1800g.</div></div><hr />

Lifestone dropped while grinding larval acids in EPL.  Had a stupid bat add while killing my larva and so I had to kill him too.  At least he made it worth it.<br />
<br />
I know there was one more, but I really can't remember, it's been a while.</div></div><hr />
