<br />
www.Eqdruids.com has some great &quot;where to hunt&quot; ideas 1-65. Im sure you can find many useful posts there if you cant find one in this board.</div></div><hr />

You can't really blame the true newbies when they imitate what they see.<br />
<br />
And you can't blame the old folks like us who've been and seen pretty much everything.  We just want to PL our alts as fast as possible.  ;)</div></div><hr />

They gave nice bumps in xp to these zones and it really does make a difference.  Here's what I would generally recommend:<br />
<br />
1-20 -- Paludal <br />
21-25 -- Mistmoore<br />
26-30 -- ToFS<br />
31-40 -- Gunthak<br />
41-50 -- Dulak/City of Mist<br />
51-55 -- Nadox<br />
55-60 -- PoP Tier 1<br />
61-65 -- PoP Tier 2</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a good way to get info for the next generation pay guides.<br />

Now if the poster had said  ... &quot;I'm level 10 and getting pretty sick of Crushbone, where should I go next?  Solo?  Grouped?&quot;  That's a respectable question.</div></div><hr />

Kineada and whoever else that posting their opinion against me asking this. I played the last phase of the beta in this game then bought it the day it came out. Clocked over 100 played days in the game and then quit shortly after luclin came out. I had my fun share of all that EQ offers and gone through the entire leveling ordeal. Now I started up again my idea of fun is putting in a movie and just EXPing for a couple hours. I don't really want to travel around as a newbie and find the new hot exp spots. I've done all that. I just want to gain some decent levels then give my time to exploreing the abundant new zones and rare mobs later on.<br />
<br />
I'm sure anyone could explain why that's wrong to play like this; just as anyone could explain why I'm right. Let's stick to the point..<br />
<br />
Thanks agian for the post Accretion</div></div><hr />
