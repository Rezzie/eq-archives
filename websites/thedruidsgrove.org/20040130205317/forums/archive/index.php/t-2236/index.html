<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LittlePach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a level 52 druid with epic and DoD bracer....where is a good place i can either root/dot or quad. I just cant find a decent place where xp is back to back and i wont get boored within 30 mins of starting the camp. Can anyone give me some good suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>VereSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesnt meet either of your preferred choices, but you could try charming in Western Wastes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LilWolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To get to 53 fast, consider raptors... sucky loot (none) but good xp.  <br />
<br />
Or elysians.  Sucky XP but GREAT items.  This is what me get back into playing myself! <br />
<br />
I have been doing the last 1/2 of the levels at raptors just to get the next set of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I spent a lot of time in Dreadlands and Burning Woods at 52-54.  In DL, I would usually track dark blues (Drolvarg Ragers, Ravaging Drolvargs and occasionally a spider or two) and cook them on the spot.  Their HPs are low enough that it actually goes pretty fast.  Burning Woods has a good quadding spot in the SW corner near the bee hive.  Again you have to be selective (I usually could only find 2-3 dark blues per quad) but xp is decent and you get an occasional spell drop.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, Gnolls in JP (Root/DoT) or Raptors in TD (charm or quad) are good options.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KrystofC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">2 good quadding spots at that level are Eastern Wastes, SW corner, at the Ulthork Man-O-War camp (might have to clear blue/lt-blue walruses to get em to spawn) and Cobalt Scar wyverns (rather over-camped, depending on the time of day you're playing).  Skyfire in the corner where Ragefire spawns is also a good place to root/cook -- as long as you know which mobs summon and avoid them.  Chromodracs here have a nasty dispel, but you should be able to root/rot em well out of their dispel range and dance in and out occasionally to get HP updates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grygonos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">chardok zone in and zone out would rule at your lvl.. assuming you have call of karana.  I still do this at 58 and make fairly good exp and some nice loot ie (3 symphonic sabers, 3 Tribal War Boots, Sarnak Battle Shield, 3 Jagged Blade of Mourning)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ciggwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EASIEST WAY to level?<br />
<br />
wyverns in CS.<br />
<br />
no faction hit, excellent exp, excellent loot.  they'll take you to 53-54</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sanre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't recall if it was at 52 or 53 I moved to CS and started quadding Wyverns, but before that I quadded Spirocs in TD and got good xp.<br />
<br />
Some of the other suggestions like Raptors in TD or Elysians in UP are probably too frustrating at your level to solo.<br />
<br />
Other possibilities are Ry'Gorr Elites (Legos may give you good xp too) in EW for root dot, Wurms and Giants in GD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xendrix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Was a long time ago before they became popular, but I did wyverns in CS.  There is a reason that area is always camped.  It does help there if you have non-KoS dragon faction before hunting there.<br />
<br />
I would wait until 54 when you get winged death before bothering with elysians, and even after that, it will be slow going for root/rot, but well worth it if you need the armor upgrades....and likely you will be able to use most of those pieces as upgrades.<br />
