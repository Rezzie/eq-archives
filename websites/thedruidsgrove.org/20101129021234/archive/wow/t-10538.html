<br />
I am not sure I fully understand the new talent though. Does this mean that it is like Natures Swiftness but it provides the full heal of a regrowth or rejuv as instantly applied? I didn't have time to read through the 35+ pages of posts at work, so hopefully someone here has the answer to that question.<br />
<br />
This just saved me 20g as I was about to respec to get Innervate for my guild runs since I am the only druid. Now I am sticking with the 14/32/5 build for awhile longer. 0/30/21 might have just gotten a lot more attractive though (i really would miss lotp buff though).</div></div><hr />

I think it was something they needed to do, after 1.8 patch too much tension between any druid who didn't want resto and guild members. It was that or make it self only.. could you imagine how much every other class would have been mad if it was self only.<br />

I don't think thats what it means.  I think its a way to instantly convert the rest of healing that would be done by an HoT to be done right away, like cashing in a cash annuity instead of taking the payments over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must say I totally agree with someone (sorry, im too lazy to check out who was) that told that we are all in the same front and should be happy for this. I think this really makes a druid desirable in any group, so it will be great for everybody.<br />
<br />
Although it could be specullating too much I think there will be a really good reason for going the whole way down in the Resto tree. If the new ability is an instant cast, that would give two instant heals for anyone that has this tallent using Rejuvenation and then Swiftmend or Nature's And Healing touch. And if Swiftmend is not that cheap, hey! you still have innervate ;)</div></div><hr />

I don't even know what to say.  What I believed to be the most powerful class (yet most understood) has just been given the ultimate buff.  <br />
<br />
Oomkins have a solution to the mana problems.<br />
<br />
Feral can dps well and add in innervate to priests in the group (i.e. why not take a feral druid for dps if they can give the healer mana every 6 minutes).<br />
<br />
Restoration druids can be more creative in their builds (24/0/27 27/0/24 or something else that comes out of this).<br />

What I seem to come up with seems to be a bit lacking here. That may be because I'm using a 1.10 talent calculator and it's all in my head.&quot;<br />
[FROM LOCKED THREAD]<br />
<br />
I would go with the 24/0/27;<br />
<br />
On the balance side the first 20 points don't matter too much, you could focus on casting with improved wrath, improved moonfire and vengeance; or focus on feral with Nature's Grasp, natural weapons, ooc, and natural shapeshifter, depending on how you like to solo/farm/grind when not raid healing.  The key obviously is to get natures grace and moonglow.<br />
<br />
On the resto side I would start with whatever talent compliments the balance choice you made (improved mark for casting or furor for feral), then take the improved HTs all the way to Nature swiftness.  I would then take 3 ranks of nature's focus, 3 reflection, and 1 in insect swarm.  I would then take 2 ranks of improved rejuv and 2 of tranquil spirit.  Then I would finish it out with 3 in gift of nature and 2 in improved regrowth.<br />
<br />
I know it doesn't maximize a lot of areas, but the net effect is huge.  Even with only 2 ranks in tranquil spirit, because of moonglow, HTs will be 13% cheaper.  Between the 2 ranks in improved rejuv and the three in gift of nature, rejuv will be 16% stronger and 9% cheaper from moonglow.  You only get 20% crit chance of regrowth, but it is 9% cheaper too and when you do crit you get the nature's grace buff that would let you whip out a HT in 2.5 seconds now.<br />
<br />
Perhaps something like this:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druids2/talents.html?3111500202501300000000000000000050530  3102213020<br />
<br />
Of course I am currently a moonkin, but play back-up healer for my guild 5-mans, and I MH UBRS Pugs all the time.  My actual spec is:<br />

Well actually I went to the dark side of the force so I'll probably just level a horde one now.<br />
<br />
Anyways as for swiftmend, I think this is really going to be a wonderful talent.  Although I think it might trivialize NS.  But then again there's no reason it shouldn't.  Non resto druids can still get NS.  SM should be adequately more powerful due to its resto only accessability.  So just what I would gather from it based on my experiences with conflag since that is the comparison...<br />
<br />
Conflag is just like described.  Put on immolate.  Whenever you feel ready blow it up as long as immo is still on.  Conflag has its own damage parameters standing alone from the immolate.  In other words it does XXX damage regardless of how much immo has left.  I see no reason SM would not follow this same pattern.  After all its much easier to implement and to do otherwise would trivialize the spell (since druids do what we do with our tricked out rejuv.)<br />
<br />
Conflag as a 31 point spell, is really one of the most user friendly spells I have as a lock.  It does require immo to be on, which makes timing important (though this is really not hard).  It does great damage (afterall it is a 31 pt talent).  Its base damage is actually higher than shadowburn.  In addition it is rediculously mana efficient, it has less mana cost than both shad burn and shad bolt.  Also it has a relatively low cooldown.  In most pvp and non elite fights I can pull it off 2 times if I open with immo and conflag right away.  Though usually 1 is enough then kill them with shadow burn.  The point I want to make is that conflag is designed to be frequently used (highly mana efficient, strong base damage, short cooldown)<br />
<br />
I think SM will follow the same pattern.  I don't think it will be as strong as many hope.  But somewhere in the range of 1200-1500 starting to 1800-2000 max at level 60 I think is reasonable.  Not as strong as healing touch, but close.  But at the same time I think the cooldown will be pretty short too.  I think it fits with the other two 31 pt talents.  The auras are always on as long as shifted so the idea is something that will be frequently in use.  Judging from the way they designed conflag as well as the druid 31 pt talents I think SM would be similar.<br />
<br />
A lot will have to be seen as to its power, cooldown and mana efficiency.  But I think it will be more a frequent use heal as opposed to just another oh Sh!t button which NS already gives.  I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a routine part of a druid healing cycle just as conflag is to a warlock's nuking pattern.  <br />
<br />
Anyways to sum up, for a warlock conflag is a playstyle defining spell.  Locks that have it do damage much differently than locks that don't (partially cuz of conflag, partially cuz destro tree layout).  But its just something that gets used very often.  The design of the spell, its just plain fun to use.  I think if SM is anything like that for druid's healing, there will be a lot of happy restro druids out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">05-03-2006, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple new thoughts, and reiterating some of mine in my thread which was locked.<br />
<br />
The change to Innervate won't create many Moonkin / Leader of the Pack Druids, at least for any length of time.  Innervate was never the block for this, despite it being the best talent amongst all classes in the game.  The block for Moonkin/LotP was, and remains Nature's Swiftness.  It's an insanely great ability in both PvE and PvP.  As bad as the Paladin talent review may have been, one thing Blizzard did right was make Blessing of Kings an 11 point talent.  Had they done the same with NS, you'd see many more Balance/Feral druids (and more full Elemental/Enhancement shaman).<br />
<br />
To reiterate some of my thoughts on Swiftmend, the key things about this ability to consider are Cooldown, Amount Healed, and Mana Efficiency.  As an insta-cast spell, it won't scale with gear.  As raid encounters went from MC to BWL to AQ, one thing is apparent:  Spike Damage is huge.  Tanks need more healers assigned for most encounters than they did in MC.  DPS are left to potion or bandage.  For Swiftmend to be a good talent, one Resto druids will embrace, it must help offset this spike damage.<br />
<br />
The only ability similar to this currently in game is Power Word: Shield.  In the Priest review, this ability is now slightly affected by +heal gear (iirc it's at 10%), and the recast cooldown on one target is now 15 seconds.  The amount &quot;healed&quot; is equal to about 1 hit from some AQ20 trash mobs on plate.  Mana efficiency is the biggest reason it isnt used more often - a paltry 2.0 HpM roughly.  The value of PW: Shield is much less in 20 and 40 man raids than it is in 5 or 10 man, where the spell can easily buy time for a cast of a direct heal.  <br />
<br />
Swiftmend is going to be compared to PW: Shield, and if it's better, it will be a worthy talent.  Given increasing mob damage output, and ratios between longer cast time damage spells and heals, this isn't unreasonable.  A 1500 heal every 10-18 seconds for 550-600 mana (2.7 to 2.5 HpM efficency) wouldn't imbalance the game.<br />
<br />
Would it help keep mages alive clearing the suppressor room?  Would it make healing on Firemaw and Battleguard Satura easier?  Yes.  Considering Naxxramas is coming out with Swiftmend, I don't think that is a bad change.  There's a lot of trash, from looking at the screenshots.  If it's anything like AQ40 trash, raids are going to need more fast heals - something Druids can't contribute with mana efficiency today.  <br />
<br />
Spare me the theorycraft of Regrowth efficiency, the 18 second duration of the HoT makes half it's cast overheal in most raid situations (basically anything other than Vael).  We heal dps with it because we have nothing else close to a 1.5 sec cast.<br />
<br />
My hope for Swiftmend is it will make us better at dealing with spike damage on tanks, and better at keeping dps alive.</div></div><hr />

Its mostly about the speed though, not the cost.<br />

The warlock ability conflagrate works the same way but for damage (turns a DoT into damage spike), its been around a lot longer so looking for information on how it works and is effected by gear will probably give you a good idea about how SM will work.</div></div><hr />

* Swiftmend: This new talent has been added to the Druid Restoration tree, replacing Innervate as the 31 point ultimate talent. It consumes a Rejuvenation or Regrowth aura to produce an instant heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The important part for me is it consumes the aura of Rej. or Reg. to produce an instant heal. This sounds like you can allow the heal over time to run its course and catch in just at the end of its life to convert it into a full heal. What the size of this heal is Im not sure but since I spam alot of Rej. whilst healing it provides an instant spike heal, makes it worth the points I think as long as natures swiftness isnt effected by its cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Innervate is a 31 point talent in the restoration tree that when casts increases the targets mana regeneration by 400% and allows 100% of the targets mana regeneration to continue while they are casting. it has a 6 minute cooldown and lasts for 20sec.:epopcorn:</div></div><hr />

With the 1.11 patch I have a whole new aspect to healing with swiftmend. I find myself often casting a curtain HoT on the party during trash pulls and boss fights just to make sure everyone is topped up on HP. With a damage spike to the tank I can consume this effect instantly to keep the tank alive long enough to get a full heal off. This has saved us from wipes on a few occasions. If you are a druid who does alot of healing I would recommend this talent in an instant, it just plain makes you a better resto druid. :elfbiggri</div></div><hr />
