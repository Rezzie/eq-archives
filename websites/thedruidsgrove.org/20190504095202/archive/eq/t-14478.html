Kill harpies around Shrynn to get him to talk, then kill giants to get random drop from trash giants.  Mine came from 'a Dromrek hunter', then return to Shrynn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serrin</div><div class="date">10-02-2006, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone have further info on Obsidian? He's marked on my map, but I'm not sure if it's an exact location or a general region. I camped a few basilisks in the area for about 6 or 7 rounds, and he didn't spawn. Am I having bad luck, or is he one of those low chance, large number of spawnpoint mobs that soloers hate so much?<br />
<br />
Also, Wycca posted this over at Monkly. Thought you'd all be interested:<br />
&quot;Illegible Diary of Lorekeeper Baeldon - is for this quest also.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: According to Wycca at Monkly, the diary page is from an instanced Valdehome.<br />
<br />
As far as Obsidian goes, he might be a longer spawn timed mob rather than one with PHes. I camped the basilisks for about an hour and a half and found nothing. I logged on the following day and found granite up and killed him. Then I checked every hour or two and saw nothing, especially not people killing basilisks. Then I found both Granite and Obsidian up. I find it odd that two named would pop when I never saw anybody else kill them. Thus, the long spawn time theory.</div></div><hr />

I was hunting scales and had not cleared but maybe 10 mobs deep before respawn started, and I'm fairly certain Obsidian was respawn.   I guess its possible could be just a random timed spawn, but I never ended up having an 'extra' mob amidst the repops.   Killed him solo quite easy enough, just kept charming his buddies and throwing them at him, does not summon.  Obsidian is one of the large black models, so I assume the elders are PH.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to give up my theory and go with the lots of lame PHes theory. I went to the loc I recorded and found a non-Obsidian basilisk, so that's some pretty good evidence for PHes. Anyway, when I killed him, he roamed back and forth, but stopped from time to time at -2597, -1543 or so. I have no evidence or guesswork regarding whether or not that's his only spawn, or just one possible one.<br />

<br />
Oblivion is a large ooze mob, blue to 75, raid mob, hits like a truck and spawns adds.  He is almost certainly the source of &quot;Oblivion's Dark Core&quot;.<br />
<br />
Obsidian def. spawns in the SE area of Sunderrock.  As an aside, there's two more named basilisk here at least - one named Granite, light blue to 75, easy as pie.  Another named Komodokin.... hits for 4500, and rampages.  VICIOUS, McMahon.</div></div><hr />

Obsidian is light blue (to lvl 75), doesn't summon, snare-able (assuming rootable too, didn't try), not a lot of hp's, when i did get hit, wasn't for more than 1k.<br />
Just wanted to mention this so others don't get stuck on this part waiting for a group's help: he's an easy solo kill.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
On the subject of the Wulfnore Crown Gem: Stonemight Chieftain Rockbottom cast FD when you agro him, so be ready for it. You don't need to kill him and the other goblins around the Worn Jug in order to loot, simply agro them, train them away, snare, and run back to loot.</div></div><hr />

Run north/ northeast until you  get close to the portal of war ( but not aggroing the mobs there).  Hit exodus or cast egress.  Run back to chief's hut.. you should have plenty of time... but do it soon I'd suggest.</div></div><hr />

Worked for me like a charm (no pun)! You just need to watch for the roaming mob that paths behind the structure.<br />

I can confirm that Oblivion's Dark Core drops off Oblivion in Sunderrock Springs.<br />
<br />
He spawns in the North West corner of the zone.  He has a huge number of adds, so this is a raid mob.<br />
