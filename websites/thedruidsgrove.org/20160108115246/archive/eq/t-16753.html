Right now both Characters have around 30 aa's. Im in need of a good grind spot to get my aa's going along with maybe some exp grinding for when im not grouping. <br />

There are lots of animals there to play with. After you are done with that and gain a few levels, to get the next charm, I would move to icefall glacier and cham kite mammoths or bears. There are a couple other animal type mobs in icefall also.</div></div><hr />

There is a very good post here about how to PL using a druid.</div></div><hr />

Then just use the druid to solo and the bard takes party exp.  Lower level means more AA exp so I guess it's better than the higher level bard itself.</div></div><hr />

You should be able to kill em but may be slow for you but will give good xp. Should get 2 aas with lesson running.</div></div><hr />

Great for 70 druid... tons of the tasks are either animals or root rot mobs and nameds.<br />
 <br />
Plus a great aug at the end of the tasks.......<br />
