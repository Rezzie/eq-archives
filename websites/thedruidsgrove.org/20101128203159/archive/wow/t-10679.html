Where should I go, for 40-50?  For skinnable beasts, quests, drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until 45, I'd quest instead of grind... 40-45 sucked hard for me.<br />

hehe</div></div><hr />

Waste Water Bandits of Tanaris<br />
<br />
On several of my toons, I just headed *east* of Gadget and worked the Waste Waters for their pouches.<br />
<br />
You can also grind on the Wolves and Some trolls in hinterlands.<br />
<br />
Lesser Rock Elementals in Badlands</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Yetis in Feralas are great for grinding/skinning. There is one group just off the road that crosses the zone. They would be good low to mid 40s. There is another group further north towards Desolace that's slightly higher in level that you could do in your later 40s. Kill/skin any apes and bears that happen to be around, too.<br />
<br />
There's also the Badlands with its cats and wolves for grinding/skinning in your early 40s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes yes yes.<br />
<br />
I ground these guys for my first mount.<br />
<br />
If you hit The Dust Bowl (just outside of Kargath) you have them spaced apart perfectly for an endless grind loop.<br />
<br />
Do a few laps of the area, kill some mobs, get some stone chips and what not...get some XP, run over to Kargath to turn it in for quite a bit of money.<br />
<br />
Lather, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
Plus once you hit 45, you can move down south to get the higher level mobs which have a very high percentage of dropping some nice BoE blues.<br />
<br />
(This is assuming you are Horde)</div></div><hr />
