http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=77601<br />
 <br />
I am thinking this may not be related to the druid epic but if this disease passed through WL the Giants may be wanting some more supplies to fight this disease. Plus i know that there are some other older druid quests in WL/Kael. Just a thought <br />

I've tried many different combines with vendor bought Maidenhair Fern without success.  Also tried giving the vendor bought version to every NPC I could think of.  As of yet, nothing works.

I think the Ulthork raider can be triggered.... me and a group went there last night and he wasnt up, so I myself went to CS and talked to Blumblum, and went through all the text... then ported back to Iceclad and zoned into EW.... as soon as I zoned in he popped, had a ranger friend there tracking.  Killled all 3 mobs and he didnt drop the totem, I tried this again and he didnt pop this time, but I am thinking even though he can be triggered he still might be on a timer on trigger.<br />

  Also, when I tried to speak to Blumblum, I hailed him and he was too busy to speak to me , but I said &quot;what maiden hair&quot; and he started with everything that was going on yada yada yada..<br />

Blumblum says the waters already have a &quot;sickness&quot;  and there is an ailing walrus in CS.  So it seems to be the disease is in full force in CS/SG making the water and animals sick.  So i think that would be the source, since it would take some time for the disease to manifest itself and make the creatures ill and sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remi</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to suggest to add to the summary that, in connection with the goblin foragers in LOIO, if the timer has reset, one needs to get in range of the spawn area with the Waterproof Bag to spawn the goblin foragers.  Not just zone in, but the bag holder needs to move within tracking range of the spawn area.   <br />
<br />
I admit I doubted this theory, however, I'm now a believer after my experience.  That is, I was at the spawn area in LOIO immediately after the server came up after the patch.  After waiting 5 hours, the gobbie foragers still had not spawned.  When I asked in druidsgrove chat, there was some dispute whether the Waterproof Bag was required or not.  But, after waiting 5 hours, I was willing to try anything.  I have not yet gotten the Waterproof Bag (didn't want to take up bank space with a 4 slot container), but Nueko of Xegony had and volunteered to come to LOIO with it.  When he zoned in, the GF's still did not spawn, but the very second he came into range of my track, the GF's did in fact spawn.  <br />
<br />
Thanks much to Nueko for dropping what he was doing to help me, and to test this, as well as those in the chat who were insistent that it was true, despite the many disbelievers, myself included!  :)</div></div><hr />

It was confirmed today that the mobs we look for (Bloodgill Foragers / Ulthork Raider) are INDEED triggered by any druid zoning in with the Waterproof Bag.<br />

Are we absolutely sure abou this?  I sat at their spawn for 2.5 hours the other day with the bag in my inventory and they did not spawn.  <br />

Some of my people witnessed a hairless-one swimming from the grotto just before the first sickness was seen.  Of course many of your people come swimming out of the grotto, so I would give it little thought.  Some of my people have decided that it must have been that hairless swimmer that cause the illness.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garowen</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the 'Bag' from the FM gobbie event, IS the evidence, and we are searching for another plant.  <br />
 <br />
Plant + Plant + Plant + Bag used to distribute plants<br />
 <br />
** likely/unlikely comments are in my opinion**<br />
 <br />
Also, we got a Waterproof collection bag, and 2 of the 3 clues so far, have been Water based.  If we concider the Bag as the evidence, then the last clue could be found at a poisonable water supply, IE: Lake Rathe, OOT(unlikely), Tim Deep(unlikely), Feerott, Innothule Swamp, Oasis(not very likely but possible), WC, Karanas(not highly likely).  Another possibility, is the Gates of Discord zones, may provide a clue, we haven't really been checking there, and it would tie more recent expansions into our epic(requiring us to own those expansions, and but them if we don't just so we can get our epic)  or even a new OOW zone (unlikely).<br />
 <br />
Plus so far we have 2 items from goblins, and one from otters.  they are all 'monsters' in norrath, not Player races.  They all could be thought to be damaging to the environment by the Unkempt Druids.  If thats the case we may find something from them someplace.<br />
 <br />
Also the combine could be Plant + Plant + Evidence + Evidence.  the message we get when receiving the Waterproof collection bag, is worded such that there WILL be more than 1 plant, but there COULD be more than 1 evidence.  but certainly there is an evidence, and more than 1 plant.  Perhaps what we seek is some kind of note or plans or book dropped by an evil god, in an evil god's zone, or from an Unkempt Druid.  Qeynos sewers is another thought.  it has water, AND evil.  And Bertox followers.<br />
 <br />
So my suggestion is look near Water, or in Water, think if you were poisoning a water supply, where would you go?  now hail every NPC you can find near that place, and search for trackable and untrackable/odd mobs.</div></div><hr />

Blum is talking the various races, given hes only speaking to various druids he could be refering to the 4 starting druid races IE Human, Wood, Elf, Half Elf or Hafling. Almost feel like the next step is back in one of the Druid starting cities. The only thing I can think of that comes close to &quot;skin of your people&quot; is zombie skin.<br />

   Talk to  blumblum  in CS prior to mob spawn. <br />
   Say: <br />
   Maiden's Hair <br />
   What Problem? <br />
   What fair deal? <br />
    <br />
   Then head to EW (I used WL, Kael, evac, EW...can bind in EW or Kael, but I didn't bother)<br />
 Then when mob spawns he should drop totem. Did this 15-30 mins prior to spawn twice (Sunnen and myself) each time Raider dropped totem. <br />
    <br />
 The Raider is on a 1.5 hour event reset and is only alive for about 20 mins before he despawns. If you use this tactic make sure you have another tracker in EW to hold the spawn for you as many druids are bound there to check spawn. This is NOT 100% confirmed. It is currently just a nice coincidence, but there is always a chance that this might help. If you have a friend there to hold spawn you have nothing to lose, but you may have a totem to gain. =)<br />

Since I'm not overly familiar with the whole of PoM, I couldn't find this person, nor do I know if it's new or not  Anyone a little more familiar with PoM that could enlighten me would be appreciated.<br />
Jaxoa is not new. I think Jaxoa is in the old black and white room inside the castle, either that or the big chessboard.<br />
<br />
If you're bored and banging around PoM looking for clues, you might want to talk to Lithiniath near the moat. After killing him countless times, I'm kos. He's insane so probably won't shed much light but it's best to be thorough I guess. Being even more thorough you might want to talk to White Lithiniath (spawned by turning in horn dropped by 'a white stallion' nearby, to Lithiniath)... but be fast, the great white unicorn waits for no man.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if anyone's inspected the moat thoroughly either.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd be surprised if the quest designers give much thought to PoM anymore. So much potential... virtually all wasted. /sigh<br />

The question is, how did the &quot;disease get carried so far into the world of Norrath?. My theory says that Niera's mother found the soggy maiden's hair in a fish (the trigger fish) that she gutted so she could cook it, got on a boat to Oasis where she proceeded to look for a teleportation to Kunark. Along the way she had to go through Innothul Swamp and The Feerott to get to the only place she thought of getting a port out to Kunark, which was throught the Unkempt Druids in Rathe Mountains, where she dropped some of the Maiden's hair (sickly maiden's hair). When she was ported to Kunark she tr5aveled to Friona Vie via the Dreadlands. She then made her way to Lake of Ill Omens, where she swam across the lake and dropped more of the maiden's hair (bloodgil foragers - Handful of Diseased Maiden's Hair). She was then caught by the goblins and killed for trying to help the prisoners escape and the goblins found what was left of the maiden's hair on her (Bag of Diseased Maiden's Hair). Question is, what zones should we look in? Should we go to Innothul Swamp and Feerott again and see if there are any clues there, or should we check the Dreadlands to see if anything shows up there? Just some of the zone there are to think about while trying to figure all this out.</div></div><hr />

We start the Quest in Original Everquest (Antonica), then we go to Kunark, and then onto Velious, just based on that (and that we seem to be following a timeline here), seems the next spot to look would be on the moon, then Ykesha, then Pop, etc.<br />

First time I went for the bloodgill foragers another druid was camping them. My entering the zone with waterproof bag did not spawn them.

A maiden started the trip from SG. Went through CS and EW. Crossed the ocean to land in Antonica, possibly RM, then probably moved through a few other zones like Feerrott, Innothule Swamp, Oasis of MArr, Southern Desert of Ro. Back again on the ocean, to Kunark, with LoIO and FM before dying in the temple of Droga.<br />
<br />
The most likely places to find something, imho, are Feerrott, Innothule Swamp, Sro and Oasis of Marr. Any directly adjacent zones as well of course. If we had to talk to someone about clues, I'm thinking Oasis would be a good place to start. Sro as well.<br />

You need four things, magical clay, a body part from the animal you wish to befriend, something on the subject that you wish to know about and some water.  You also need to use a kiln, so I hope you are a talented potter. Now, this only works on the animal from which the body part is taken or one of its direct descendents.  You may have to try a lot of animals to find the right one.'<br />
[Fri Sep 24 11:29:57 2004] Niera Farbreeze says 'You already have a body part from an alligator in Feerrott.  There is magical clay to be found in Taelosia, from what I hear.  All you need then is something to focus the animal's mind on.  Food is probably the best thing.  Gators eat just about anything, so there's a chance you can find one that knows where that intruder with the grass ended up if you can get an alligator to tell you where it's eaten.  I'd suggest a good slab of the best piranha meat you can find.  It's worth a try.  At this point any help would be good.  I've been looking at this disease and it is nasty in a subtle way.  It barely infects the plants, causes them little harm, but it spreads quickly.  So quickly, in fact, that it must be magical.  We need more information to stop it.'<br />
<br />
Handing in the Piranha Meat gets you nothing after the above text.<br />

Based on the lore of the items involved this would definately create the Feerott Alligator charm. (may need to be fired before the combine is completed)<br />
 <br />
and having this and going into track range probably spawns an alligator,  Then you kill the alligator, and loot the partially digested head, and maiden's hair.<br />
 <br />
OR you give the charm to the Alligator, and he coughs up the head and hair, <br />
OR you give the charm to an NPC to spawn the alligator, and you kill him then.<br />
OR you charm the Alligator, and give him the Charm to receive head and hair.<br />
 <br />
The Head we probably hand to someone, even Neira for more quest info, or it is part of the evidence.<br />
 <br />
Something like the the other events and spawn ranges/zones in have caused.<br />
 <br />
Likely to be a red con, with AoE, and needing 1-2 groups to kill.</div></div><hr />

I was still tracking one of them at druid ring after they had disappeared off the tracking list.  Then I &quot;lost my target&quot; a minute later, and they did not show up again in a full Feerrott day cycle.<br />

<br />
I was on top of the big hill in giant alley when I got mine - up where the giant skellies spawn, where the stone tower is.  My forage is at 200, and it took me about 15 minutes before I got the MH.  <br />
<br />
All the reports I've heard of the forage taking forever are from those without a maxed forage skill.  Perhaps that might be a good step for all of you druids who aren't quite 60 yet.  Skill that forage up as quickly as you can in preparation for this part.</div></div><hr />

I sat around foraging for 3 hours or so, decided to succor and found a ranger there also trying to forage. Said his friend had gotten the forage within 10 attempts around that location. I got my forage within about 30-45 minutes after succoring. (Which may or may not have been just because I was in the zone so long.)<br />

When you initially track him he will be green (lvl 37).  After you hail him and he gives you the alligator scales (and you become KoS) he will get an insta-boost in levels and become dark blue, and is immune to run speed changes.  He doesn't hit too hard, though.<br />
<br />
To get the scales you have to hail the green version.  I first tried hailing the blue version after another druid had just gotten his scales, and all he said was something about &quot;Have you seen any wolfies, I sure would like to see another wolfie&quot; (and I was in wolf form at the time).  He despawned a couple minutes later, and respawned as the green version after about 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rangers are researching about 'diseases of the mind' in their epic quest.<br />
<br />
The following is text from the ranger's epic quest after they finished with the animals...<br />
<br />
Corun Finisc says 'This is frightening. A disease that can affect mosquito and wyvern must be a truly horrible thing. I will examine these samplese carefully and pass knowledge to others who are working to repair this. From what you've shown me I can tell that the disease affects both the mind and the skin. Others seek information about illnesses of the skin. I need you to uncover information about diseases of the mind. I know not where to find such information, but you are a seeker and a worthy ranger. Find someone, somewhere, that knows enough about disease that affects 'more advanced' creatures such as men. Learn about the diseases of the mind. I will seek among the folk of the glade and pine for assistance with a cure for the Maiden's Hair. Please do not give up the search, no matter how difficult. This is a terrible illness and we must stop it from spreading. Take a copy of my notes with you, they may be of use to someone with the right knowledge.' <br />
<br />
From here, they go to this NPC...<br />
<br />
West Freeport<br />
Shana Liskia<br />
Enchanter Guild Master in the Academy of Arcane Sciences<br />
[LOC?]<br />
<br />
Say &quot;What diseases of the mind?&quot;<br />

Shana Liskia says &quot;I study the mind. My most recent research deals with, well, I'd rather not discuss that. Unless you need something specific, I dont really have time for long random conversations right now.&quot;<br />

Our texts says...<br />
<br />
See if you can find a way to learn the identity of the head, but first I need you to learn as much as you can about diseases of the skin.<br />

With ANY animal-charm spell. We druids get them, you know. =P And the swamp alligators are so green that even very low charms should work.

[Fri Sep 24 19:33:30 2004] Gravelady Beddia says 'Hmmm... since you seem to be a creature of the woods, perhaps you can get something for me that I've wanted to read for a long time.  There is a story of a battle between the God of Dribbles and the Lord of Plagues.  We call this battle The Corruption of Night.  I don't know what you people call it, but I know you must have a text concerning it.  Bring me that text and I shall give you something that you probably should not have.'<br />
 <br />
I think she wants our books about the battle of Kithikor or some other battle between Bertox and Karana if thats not kith.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried this on Thursday, mid afternoon, a number of lower XP groups in the zone, triggered the contest, a number of Hiders eventually spawned, I killed 3, a 4th was saved by the bell :( , none of them &quot;said&quot; anything at all, and none dropped the bag. Contest ran about 35 minutes, I didn't note game time I started it.<br />
<br />
I tried it again this morning, I was the ONLY person in the zone, started the contest, ONLY 1 Hider spawned (trust me), it spoke (Goblin Hider says 'Your dead corpse will soon line my pockets with gold!') when I rooted it AND dropped the bag.  This contest ran for over an hour, started 10pm game time.<br />
<br />
** It would seem that the number of people in the zone influences the number of Goblin Hiders, and also that the REAL one talks, not the fakes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.amichi.us/~gondola/amichi/sludge.jpg <br />
<br />
I found it in the river in Feerrott not far from where I spoke with Bouncer Flerb.  It looks like a bag on the river bottom.  Sorry, I didn't get a /loc.<br />
<br />
Niera Farbreeze says 'You say that this Bouncer told you that he'd thrown someone in the river with grass in his pants? How very strange. You should search the river, see if you can find anything, though I don't know how you could expect to find anything in that mess. Hmm... these scales give me an [idea].'<br />
<br />
Bouncer Flerb isn't working right, though.  I was still KOS in wolf form. (66 druid, Tunare) and he started attacking immediately when I hailed him.  However, if you wait out the script, you'll still get the scales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jennafae</div><div class="date">09-24-2004, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nimchip, please include some more details about the Goblin Event ....<br />
 <br />
1. Even with your illusion on, some of the Goblins may attack you (a few whipcrackers attacked me). Have your root and snare up before you reach Droga.<br />
 <br />
2. There are several minutes of nothingness between the first line of dialog &quot;You Right! Me want Prize...&quot; and when the King saunters out of the Droga entrance and wanders over to a hill close by. Every line of 'shouted' dialog from the goblins has a pause of several minutes in between. I was uncertain if I'd done everything correctly at first because I was expecting everything to happen faster. Other people might find this info useful so they too aren't confused.<br />
 <br />
3. There must have been *50* Goblin Seekers that spawned in the course of the King's dialog. Saying &quot;a bunch of Goblin Seekers&quot; is a gross understatement. At level 65 most of them were dark blue to me. <br />
 <br />
4. EXTREMELY difficult to track the Goblin Hider. I was in the zone with a bard friend helping me track and neither of us ever saw more than 1 on track at a time. Taking the advice of the walkthrough, I continued on the course of my initial track .... and on .... and on ..... and on ..... never found him. Eventually I lost track and had to start all over with the tracking, and it was dificult to find his track again. After several tries I gave up with heading one direction on my track and tried a new strategy, following his exact directions and continually hitting my toggle target as I went. He shadowsteps, therefore taking me around in circles over and over again. Toggle Toggle Toggle. Track Track Track.<br />
 <br />
NEVER FOUND HIM.<br />
 <br />
5. Finally, King Dronan shouted out that he was bored and the contest was over. POOF, the Goblin Hider is gone and I'm screwed.<br />
 <br />
It's not true that you can still find him after the event is over, at least not now. Someone in the druid channel said they changed this with the last patch. If that's true, Sony just earned a mark on my ****list. That's saying a lot because I'm generally very content with playing the game as a druid and I don't bitch about gameplay very much. <br />
 <br />
So here is where I stand: Back to EJ, N.Ro, and FoB to forage my items AGAIN. Back to FM to kill goblins for all of the disguise items AGAIN. Back to PoK to combine all of my ingredients for the Disguise, AGAIN. Then back to FM one more time to get screwed by the Goblin Hider. Again.<br />
 <br />
OR I could try to purchase all the items in the Baz ... but people on my server have already figured out which items are for the new epic quests, and prices are goin' up fast. <br />
 <br />
This is fun. Really. This is what playing a GAME should be about. Fun. Real fun .....<br />
 <br />
*sigh* I'm all for a challenge, honest I am. This is just ridiculous, though. I've spent DAYS foraging items and killing Goblins. The least they could have done was let us have two charges on the stupid disguise so we could try again, especially since they nerfed the Hider being up after the contest is over.</div></div><hr />

I's wager it's a slight against Karana, God of Storms.  So Karana vs Bertox, probably dealing with their first major confrontation.<br />
 <br />
I highly doubt it's vendor fodder, most likely a quest in JPF, PoD, CoD, BoT, or PoS.  Since we already had a piece in PoS, I'd think that it's not there - though I think there are some unaccounted for Nameds in there as of late.  JPF is the same thing, we've already been there.  BoT just doesn't strike me as were it is, unless you have to talk to Karana after an Agnarr kill (or at least someone up there near his bookcase).  Leaves us with PoD and CoD, and PoD seems kinda tapped out seeing as nothing new has been seen around there.  CoD on the other hand, probably doesn't get many Druids crawling through there with a group on a hunch.  :p<br />
 <br />
There's also the quite excellent possibility of a quest in LoY or OoW (at least a kill there).  Or even PoK, PoT, Ak`Anon, Qeynos Aquaducts...hmmm, more places to check than I thought.  -_-  Off to check the EQ RPG books for ideas!</div></div><hr />

Ok, Bertoxxulous associates with oozes, undead, and all manner of evil creatures.  He has *no allies* among the gods, but has several enemies including Tunare, Rodcet Nife, Karana, Mithaniel Marr, and Rallos Zek (odd, huh?).  Revered by necromancers and few others.<br />
 <br />
Karana's worshippers are farmers, herders, Druids, and Rangers.  Allied with Mithaniel Marr and Tunare, while his prime enemy is Bertoxxulous.<br />
 <br />
Neither Diety have created a race on Norrath, but both seem to be rather mild in terms of accomplishments.  Oddly, their typical avatars (according to the book) are strikingly similar - Bert is typically a hunchbacked rotting corpse, drapped in tattered robes, with a handsome face.  Karana is usually a hunched, older human in robes, leaning heavily upon his staff.<br />
 <br />
Races that can worship Bert at creation: Gnomes, Half-Elves, Humans<br />
Races that can worship Karana at creation: Half-Elves, Halflings, High Elves, Humans, Wood Elves.<br />
 <br />
Not sure if any of this helps at all, but there's some food for thought I spose.<br />
 <br />
I don't think the book would be in the possesion of a worshiper of Karana since it doesn't strike me as something he'd keep around.  Ohhh, what about the library in Neriak?  Just trying to think of leads.  -_-</div></div><hr />

Bertoxxulous v Karana.<br />
 <br />
One confrontation between these two gods springs to mind. The Plague of the Karanas.<br />
 <br />
For those of you who have only been playing a short time Bertoxxulous released a plague on those zones thus challenging the might of Karana. Many animals in North Karana were affected and large swarms of beetles attacked unwary travellers in West Karana.<br />
 <br />
If memory serves me right it was an evil cult, the Bloodsabers who were behind this event and they were based in Qeynos.<br />
 <br />
It might be worth checking out the Karana zones affected in that plague, I do recall that it was ended with some sort of battle in North Karana? maybe someone in those zone knows more about our search for the book.<br />

Set up camp in that corner, neither of us had anything more than self buffs, we killed the one that wanders right to bottom of tube, then 2 more rushed us, the 2 that roam a little further down the passage, each of us tanked one, they do summon, but if you can position them with your back in the corner they are rather easy, just doulbe up your ds and regen, and nuke the crap outta them, they have relatively low hp and we each, having about 6.2 k mana were able to clear them all and had 20m left as last died.  After killing those first 3 roamers, he just invised and i used ER4 and harmony'd his targets and he pulled one or 2 back each time, roughly 8-9 there in that area.  One piranha meat dropped from a &quot;large greenblood piranha&quot; during the first cycle, and the first respawn, &quot;a greenblood piranha&quot; dropped the next..got both drops in about 30 min time.  Oh and remember to take off SoE, its easier to channel underwater if you aren't levitating.  We didn't experience the problems of being summoned through walls etc, however we were very careful about our aggro and we did exodus once and succor once before we got it down. <br />

Swarmlings, And I think Swarm Mother, or something like that, were the plague that bert put on the karanas. This was called &quot;The Three Fold Curse.&quot; This is probably not the title of the book, but it is something to go on. <br />
<br />
The question is why cant the Grave Lady(SK) get the book. We know that it cannot be in PoK because anyone can get books there. She worships Bert and cannot talk to the NPC, or go to the city where the book is stored.<br />
<br />
There are three ways we could aquire a book imo. <br />
1) Quest from a Karana worshipper or Ally.<br />
    A) Get a drop, turn in for book<br />
    B) Kill a mob loot book<br />
2) Ground spawn in some Library... Again in a Karana worshiping city.<br />
3) The least likely on a merchant.<br />
<br />
Where are these Karana Worshipers....<br />
RV, JP, SFG, QY, Karanas, PoS, and maybe nerdarias.<br />
<br />
Of course we cannot rule out any zone since an NPC who worships Karana could be in any zone investigation the disease for example. The zones I noted earlier would be the best places to start IMO.</div></div><hr />

[Sat Sep 25 01:33:18 2004] Nolan Greenwood says 'The tale of Innoruuk, the vile Prince of Hate, having brought a child into the world and the resulting corruption of our brother forest of Kithicor brought many a tear of mourning and rage to our eyes. And the tales of Bertoxxulous' followers tainting the lands of Karana with their accursed worship and rites boiled the blood in our veins as a thirst for vengeance arose. However, it is not only sorrow and fury that we feel. . . we know regret, for in our absence we were unable to lend our ways to these battles and it is in this knowledge of our absence that we carry the greatest burden. But we cannot let our attentions end with these tales, for a [threat] akin to the previous has seeped through our barricades and the Jaggedpine is in danger.''<br />

Fresh Awakenings: Volume 1<br />
My eyes are old and tired now. I can no longer see well enough to write. I make this statement because this will probably be the last story that I tell in my life and I do not wish scholars of the futre to discount it because it is not written in my hand. You shall recognize my style nonetheless, I am certain.<br />
This story was told to me by Askr the Loyal, servant of the Storm Lord and my childhood friend.  He chose a more direct service to our lord, and for it has gained a lengthened life.  This is his curse to bear.  I chose the easier path, to live and teach among mortals.<br />
Fresh Awakenings<br />
 as told to Felmire Brightshore by Askr the Loyal, scribed by<br />
  Bont<br />
We ever battle to allow nature to take its course, we fight to retain the natural balance. It is often difficult at times for this is a hard life to practice.  We love animals and yet we must not interfere as a lioness stalks a beautiful young doe.  So we must remain vigilant without over reaction.  Above all, we must teach those that do not understand.  This is my belief, though it is not shared by all.  There are those who have heard of the discovery of the Unkempt and of their belief that any that would interfere should have their capacity to interfere removed from them.  The most common method used is violent death.<br />
The truth is that our worship and our natures must be comprised of both philosophies.  We must teach those that will learn, THis is shown to us by the gentle nuturing rain and in teh bright hope of the rainbow.  It is the lightning and the ripping winds that evidence our lord's violence.  The unnatural must be cleansed when it can not be taught.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have always been battles between the corrupt and the defenders.  The lord of Plagues is ever our greatest enemy. One dark night he manifested in part onto Norrath.  A minor avatar of his own flesh pressed itself through the prisons of power that have so long kept the gods from us.  This avatar took no form, but spread itself out among the animals and people of Norrath.  Many, blessed as life by Tunare, reisted the corruption and were merely sick or died. A few, however, were transformed in spirit.  They became corrupted souls and their only desire was to bring chaos and decay to those around them.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Many were easily found and destroyed, but some were clever as well as corrupt.  Owls, weasels and wolves were the most common of these.  Their existence was proven by hunters but they could not be discovered. <br />
<br />
A council formed. Members of the unters were equally matched by those of the teachers.  Their debate was long and adruous.  They argured ideas and strategies all night long.  The leader of the hunters was a great bear, the mightiest creature in the lands.  He insisted that if the individual corruption in the owls, weasels and wolves could not be discovered, the entire species should be destroyed.  The teachers, let by an aged snake, were arguing that none of them should be harmed, that should any be discovered they should be captured and treated well until they could be cured.<br />
 <br />
As the evening progressed the only voices that could be heard over the crowed of bickering and sometimes brawling elders was the ground-shaking voice of the great bear, the persistent, slithering teacher's voice of the snake, and the high-pitched voice of a young fox.  This fox went from group to group attempting to clarify the opinions of each person.  He asked them specific questions to better understand their ideas.<br />
 <br />
As dawn approached five of the council were dead.  Ten had stormed off in anger.  There were only eight left in the glade.  As the sun rose the snake and the bear continued to argue, neither willing to agree with the other.  The fox continued to ask for clarification about issues, insisting that the bera explain how best to destroy the owls, as they might be hard to catch and asking the snake how he would keep a weasel imprisoned.<br />
It was then that an old wolf entered the clearing.  None of the wolves had been invited to the council because all of them were under suspicion.  Many wolves were hunters, many too were teachers, but thesilvered wolf than entered the glade was unknown to any of those that remained present.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He Spoke. &quot;You two, snake and bear, who are our leaders, can you answer just one question for me?  I shall leave if anyone here can provide a satisfactory answer and you may continue your discussion&quot;&quot;Speak fast, dog, or I shall begin the desctruction of your people with you,&quot; rumbled the great bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me, then. What does corruption look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
The snake responded quickly,&quot;It takes the form of disease, most often&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;And yet,&quot; said the wolf, &quot;disease weans out the unfit.  It is natural for disease to take those that it should.&quot;<br />
The snake glared at the wolf, but was unable to refute this point.  The wolf cocked his head at the bear, who had no response at all except to bear his gnarled teeth.  The wolf then looked at each of the others in turn.  None of them had a reply, until the cold grey eyes of the wolf turned to the young fox. &quot;You are a clever creature, surely you must know what corruption looks like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot;  The fox was also a vain creature, a trait that wolves despise about their smaller cousins.  &quot;Corruption is the thing that destroys the strong. It ruins the order of things.  It turns things in on themselves, changes their perspective or their course.&quot;  Foxes are also clever creatures, another trait that annoys wolves.<br />
 <br />
The wolf turned to the bear and asked, &quot;What did you come here to do this night?&quot; As he spoke a light rain began to fall.<br />
&quot;That's two questions wolf! Fox has answered you, now get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wolf then noticed that snake had slithered away while the others were talking. As the rain drifted into the grove crickets began to chirp, as they often do when things suddenly become too quiet for their liking.  Wolf glanced over at the young fox in time to see a second pair of eyes appear above his head out of the trees.  Wolf turned away into the forest the moment before snake slide his coils around fox's neck.  <br />
<br />
As soon as the wolf was out of sight the misty rain ceased.  As the sun rose a rainbow could be seen above the trees the bordered the clearing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
	You say, 'Hail, Gravelady Beddia'<br />
	Gravelady Beddia says 'Hail seeker of knowledge. There is much to be learned here in New Tanaan of the dark gods of Norrath. I have been searching the great library for tomes pertaining to my patron Bertoxxulous, the Plague Lord and made some interesting finds. If you wish to study the tomes I have uncovered you may borrow them and they will be returned to me by the magic of New Tanaan when you are through.'<br />
<br />
	You say, 'what disease of the skin'<br />
	Gravelady Beddia says 'I know much about such things, but what would you want such knowledge for? I can only surmise that your goals would not be such that I would approve of them. You would have to be willing to [sacrifice] something, get me something precious, in order to get any such information from me.'<br />
<br />
	You say, 'what sacrifice'<br />
	Gravelady Beddia says 'Hmmm... since you seem to be a creature of the woods, perhaps you can get something for me that I've wanted to read for a long time. There is a story of a battle between the God of Dribbles and the Lord of Plagues. We call this battle The Corruption of Night. I don't know what you people call it, but I know you must have a text concerning it. Bring me that text and I shall give you something that you probably should not have.'<br />
<br />
In Plane of Knowledge, talk to Pathfinder Arelat, (115, 825, 72), in the library<br />
<br />
	You say, 'Hail, Pathfinder Arelat'<br />
	Pathfinder Arelat says 'Welcome to New Tanaan, friend, and know us as neither friend nor foe. We are your allies in knowledge and shall guide you wherever we are able. Each citizen of New Tanaan, be them a child of the gods or a creature of the natural wilds, has come forward in these times to offer their wisdom and guidance unto you in any way possible. I traveled Norrath once as a pathfinder of Karana, but my fate would eventually call me here where I progressed beyond my mortal limits. Though you have some time left in you before such possibilities are open to you, perhaps the spells I have penned from memory of my service to Norrath will come to be of some use.'<br />
<br />
	You say, 'what corruption of night'<br />
	Pathfinder Arelat raises an eyebrow. 'Now where did you hear that name?' He looks intently at you for a moment. 'You've been talking to Beddia.

Arelat raises a hand, 'No, you don't have to tell me. If I can't trust you, Gamli, then I suppose I can't even trust myself.  Just tell me that it's worth it.<br />
<br />
	You say, 'it is worth it'<br />
<br />
If you do not have Mangled Head (container) in inventory:<br />

	Pathfinder Arelat says 'I am afraid that I do not see honesty in your eyes. I can not give you the texts you seek.'<br />
<br />
If you do have item Mangled Head (container) in inventory:<br />
<br />
	Pathfinder Arelat says 'Then here it is. This is a copy of an ancient text that we have preserved and copied for many long years.  The author died generations ago.  You should read it before you give it to that witch.  Good luck to you, friend.'<br />
<br />
	You recieve three books,<br />

<br />
	Niera Farbreeze says 'That's great!'  Niera scribbles some notes as she flips through the text.  She then hands the notes to you, keeping the book herself.

<br />
The text is nearly unreadable.  The language is so old that it bears little relationship to the current common tongue, but it is clearly a form of that language.  What you can read of it tells you that it discusses diseases of the skin.  It speaks of a ritual created by the solar Tribe of the Dawn.<br />
<br />
The ritual is for the cleansing of plant=born disease by the creation of a plant that grows alongside the diseased  plant and casts spores that harm the disease.  The details are written using what appears to be a sub-language that makes no sense to you at all.</div></div><hr />

Was reading the part of the books where it talked about a bear, snake, and weasel discussing things in the &quot;glade&quot;.  So I started thinking about the bears in the glade.  There's a spawn there named Mammoth (yes I realize he's been there since the beginning as I was killed by him once as a young druid).  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4511<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if perhaps we could get some information from him.  I see that he is KoS to all but perhaps we could charm him and get some info that way or do a turn in or something.  <br />
<br />
This could have nothing to do with it, just thinking.</div></div><hr />

The Story of the Unkempt Warders and Druids<br />
<br />
<br />
The Wisdomseeker Raulin had both copies of the Unkempt Warders and the Unkempt Druids available for reading. As the stories are so closely interconnected I have decided to put them on the same pages.<br />
These stories impressed me enough that I may venture to Kelethin following this research. I would like to know if any of the druids or rangers there have tried to journey to the Unkempt Woods. <br />
<br />
Wisdomseeker Raulin says, Hail adventurous traveler! I have been researching the druidic heritages of various Norrathian cultures and have made some interesting finds here in the great library. Feel free to borrow the books I have found if you like. The sorcery of the library will return the books to their proper places when you are through with them. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Unkempt Warders Vol. I <br />
This work details little of the unknown ancient legends and history of the Unkempt Warders. All text is factual, though many parts of this history are missing. The Writ of the Wild, the ancient tome from which I have gathered much of this information, is lost to me and the world for now.  <br />
<br />
I give this warning and note to all who read these words: do not use this information as a catalyst to pursue the Unkempt Woods or the people who dwell there. This work is done out of fervent respect for the Unkempt people and the bestial folk who have called this region home since before the time of the elves. Their story is great and one that should not go unheard. Do not disrupt these unique people who have mastered the true harmony of existence within the natural order of birth, destruction, chaos, and order. <br />
<br />
In any case, those who dare to trek within the unkempt's territory will find themselves greeted with passionate virulence. Even if you believe yourself one of the purest druids of the Mother of All's modern followers, the woods are not a domain for you to dwell. Leave it be - for your sake and for the sake of the last pure forest to grace the face of Norrath since the destruction of the Elddar.  <br />
<br />
-- Anonymous <br />
<br />
=) The Unkempt Wood (=<br />
-*- Valley of the Dawn-*-<br />
<br />
Nestled in ancient mystery and untold secrecy within the topmost regions of the Underfoot, beneath the Unkempt Wood, resides a mystic place known as the Valley of the Dawn. This haven of wildling beast-folk was constructed in the unknown past, concealed from the keepers of Norrath's history by the blessings of chance. <br />
<br />
The Valley of the Dawn was constructed before the time of man, perhaps even before the time of the elves. The bestial-folk known as the Tribes of the Dawn and Moon took haven on the surface of Norrath, comfortable and nestled within the confines of the dank, dark, and strangely beautiful redwood forest now known as the Unkempt Wood. As the solar and lunar tribes established themselves as fierce warriors and guardians of the natural world that they revere as sacred above all else, the tribes built the Valley of the Dawn - a complex and beautiful subterranean citadel dedicated to the laws of the wild that these beings protect. <br />
<br />
Within the first era of man, when great civilizations and cultures were still in the far distance of time, a nomadic tribe of humans stumbled upon the redwood forest. The Tribes of the Dawn and the Moon were curious, although they did not interfere with the humans' initial presence. When the humans showed themselves to be intelligent beings that wished for nothing other than their own survival, the tribes approached.  <br />
<br />
It was the Gihjna that the humans first encountered - the ursine behemoths whom represent the side of the life and creation in the cycle of nature and comprised the solar Tribe of the Dawn. The gently, although wary Gihjna interacted with the human tribe over the course of a single year and in that time, the Gihjna lent their knowledge and beliefs to the curious and eager humans. The Lujien - wolf-like creatures that embody destruction, death, and the inherent chaos of the Wild and comprise the lunar Tribe of the Moon - dd show themselves at this historic moment, despite their shared curiosity with their ursine brethren. <br />
<br />
The nomads settled within the forest and adapted themselves to the ways of nature and the wild as the Gihjna had taught them. They were fledgling in their beginnings as primordial wardens of the wild, although their magical gifts were few and almost vulgar, for all they had learned was from the Gihjna, whose spirits are more tightly bound to the natural world than any human or elf.  <br />
<br />
The Unkempt Warders Vol. II <br />
A generation would pass before the elves of Tunaria would find the majestic redwood forest. When the day arrived that a small band of scouts from the Elddar Forest found the beauty of this rugged wilderness, the human nomads reacted as the Gihjna had greeted their ancestors'. The elves were not receptive to the warm welcome that the humans extended, all but one - an elven druid by the name of Wegadas. He was curious about the human settlers, and even more curious to find that there were no man-made structures to deteriorate the life force of the forest that he felt so strongly. <br />
<br />
Wegadas accepted the humans' hospitality and despite the language barrier separating them, Wegadas quickly learned that these humans lived in harmony with the forest, and likely had for some time. Their intense geographic knowledge of the region was precise and what little bit Wegadas had to observe, he took note of the harmony which the humans shared with their habitat. He was reminded much of the primordial elves - in the times before Takish'Hiz and the establishment of the great empire his people had come to be. <br />
<br />
Wegadas' elven companions were entranced with the dank gloomy treasure they had found. They were lured by the gentle song of the forests' spirit, a song that any elf's spirit would easily hear, and bewitched by the purity and strength of the uncorrupted and untouched spiritual life and strength of the wood. <br />
<br />
After a day of intense scouting and brief interaction with the peaceful human tribe, the elves reunited with their brother and spoke of their need to have this forest for the Takish'Hiz Empire. Wegadas spoke out against his fellow elves, he did not wish to drive the humans from their home, for they live with it in a way parallel to the elves' own cultural ways. He felt that the humans could be brought to the ways of the elves and the forest could, with the aid of the Elven Empire, thrive on its own and remain the pure, emerald jewel of wilderness that they stood within. <br />
<br />
There was no need to reave this home from the tribe, for they lived only in harmony with the Wild and balance of nature. <br />
<br />
The superior in the group, a wanderer by the name of Kuvriathan, objected to Wegadas' argument and sent the him back to Takishhiz with instructions to report their discovery. The druid departed his party's side obediently, but did not leave the forest boundaries. <br />
<br />
The elves then tried to herd the humans out of this forest in attempt to cleanse it of the tribal presence and the taint they believed would inevitably bring - for these elves had seen the fledgling foundation of the eastern costal cities and knew the destruction this race was capable of on a whim. The wary Gihjna and Lujien immediate interfered, having watched the elves since their arrival. <br />
<br />
Unsuspecting of the fierce and powerful guardians of the woodland, the elves were taken unaware. All but one of the elven party were destroyed - Wegadas. When the Lujien came for him, he presented himself unarmed and willingly, despite the human pleas for him to go and not incur the wrath of the guardians that had allowed them haven in the woods. The Lujien halted their advancement when they saw the plight of their accepted human guests to spare the elf's life. <br />
<br />
It was their pack leader, an elder Lujien warrior known to the human tribe as Udos-Ehai Digowa (Fang of the Shadow in the common tongue), that approached Wegadas and sunk his great maw into the elf's shoulder, but did not kill him. The Lujien spoke in voiceless words to the elf, a conversation that would later be written in the Writ of the Wild, a sacred text that dictates the history and the code of the Unkempt Warders. <br />
<br />
The Unkempt Warders Vol. III <br />
Udos-Ehai Digowa commanded the druid to remain in the forest and share with the humans his magics and ways. <br />
<br />
If ever the druid should attempt to flee the forest confines, the Tribe of the Moon would kill him, for they are always watching. However, Wegadas was not to corrupt the knowledge and ways that the Gihjna had taught the humans. Wegadas agreed without argument and the Lujien pack faded silently into the shadows, leaving the wounded elf to the human tribe to fulfill the demands that would guarantee his continued life. <br />
<br />
Wegadas learned the language of the humans to perfection in his first fortnight. With communication established, Wegadas learned the ways that the Gihjna had taught the humans - finding them intriguing and immediately adapting them as his own for sake of the people now in his care and in respect to the native bestial tribes that spared his life. <br />
<br />
Over the first years, Wegadas taught the human tribe the ways of the wilderness - he spoke to them of Tunare, The Mother of All; the great goddess of growth and nature. He taught them how to pay their respects to his own goddess without prayer or sacrifice - only that they must respect the power of the natural worlds, for as it had given them life; it can just as easily and without warning take it from them. This is a law that should be neither feared nor hated but on that is given the respect of an inevitable reality and one that cannot be altered by steel or mind. <br />
<br />
The humans clung to Wegadas' liberal preaching and lessons, embracing the matron goddess of growth as their own. Soon thereafter, the humans would learn the ways of the druid - adapting and wielding the magics that Wegadas taught them, and that they themselves at an exceptional rate. <br />
<br />
Rangers would be the first of the master adepts, however, for the magic within them was less than their druid compatriots and the ferocity of the wild had already been established in their ways. <br />
<br />
As the human tribe became established, Udos-Ehai Digowa and the Gihjna elder, Etsi Agal-Iha(Mother of the Light) returned to the human tribe. The tribes of the Dawn and Moon established the laws of the wild: none of Wegadas' tribe was to leave the forest, and if they attempted to do so, they would be killed. They were children of the wild now, and their attempts to see the outside world would corrupt them. The Tribes of the Dawn and Moon also established that all who entered the forest would be driven out or destroyed at the discretion of Wegadas and the tribe. <br />
<br />
The third law was that the Lujien and Gihjna would remain out of the human tribe's affairs - so long as they maintained the order the Gihjna had given the generations past, and that they did not stray from their duties to the forest that has accepted them as its children. <br />
<br />
The laws were agreed upon with Wegadas' leadership, for the human tribe trusted his wisdom and guidance explicitly. Satisfied, the solar and lunar tribes departed, although their eyes never strayed from their human guests. <br />
<br />
It was in those first years that Wegadas' intrigue with the humans grew to tightly woven kinship. Slowly, he released his grip on his elven life and embraced fledgling existence and culture that he was instrumental in fathering. The elven druid was Fier'Dal no more, his brethren were no longer human - they were all children of the wild and it was then that Wegadas learned a true peace. <br />
<br />
Finding his true purpose and never longing for the life he abandoned, Wegadas would spend nearly a century composing what would become the most revered and sacred of relics to the homid tribe of the redwood forest - Writ of the Wild. <br />
<br />
This sacred tome detailed Wegadas' rebirth into the wilderness per his own perspective, as well as the laws that he had established and his people followed. The tome also detailed the Lujien and Gihjna culture and their ancient tales and religion that Wegadas had been privy to in the several centuries he dwelled among them. <br />
<br />
Unkempt Warders Vol. IV <br />
Wegadas would find several mates in his lifetime among the human tribe and be father to over a dozen children - half elven children. The last of his children and only daughter would be named Elaryness. <br />
<br />
Shortly after the birth of his final child, nearly four centuries after establishing the Writ of the Wild and guiding his brethren through their newfound ways, Wegadas was old and weary and heard the distinct call of the forest - beckoning him to fulfill his own cycle of life. The old druid would pass into the wilderness forever at a site that would later become the most sacred site of the unkempt tribe. <br />
<br />
Wegadas' body was not buried, nor was it touched by the wild creatures of the forest. He is said to have melded into the earth, and from his reclaimed flesh and spirit, a great willow grew - the Weeping Willow of Tunare. The ancient tales of the human tribe would say that the willow was a gift to Wegadas' children and brethren from Tunare herself. As she reclaimed his old spirit, the Mother of All felt the great loss that the unkempt tribe suffered with Wegadas' passing ad listened to their wordless prayer as they said their farewells to the beloved leader. In her appreciation for the human tribe's devotion to her and in honor of her missionary, Wegadas, she molded his spirit and essence into the great, beautiful willow that eternally weeps the tears of joy and sorrow of the tribe. <br />
<br />
With her father's passing and The appearance of the great willow, Elaryness, The only daughter of Wegadas, would rightfully challenge four others - two of whom were her half-brothers - who had made the declaration for leadership in Wegadas' stead. The brutal, ceremonial battles would last days at a time, where those who vied for leadership would hunt one another throughout the whole expanse of the woods. <br />
<br />
Elaryness would destroy her challengers and the tribe, now beneath her rule, would move their bodies to the very location where Wegadas himself had laid to final rest. These brutal and oftentimes savage hunts (dictated by the hunters' primordial instincts) are law amongst the Unkempt Warders, for it is the law of the wild - the strongest lead whilst the weakest follow, though none are whole without the other. <br />
<br />
Elaryness would be declared the first Hierophant of the Unkempt Warders. It was also Elaryness who would establish the Shrine of Tunare, in memory of her father and to fulfill the debt that she felt her entire tribe owed the Mother of All for her gift of Wegadas, the weeping willow. <br />
<br />
For several more generations, the Unkempt Warders would flourish and hold true to their vows to the Lujien and Gihjna tribes. However, it would be the settlement of The Jaggedpine forest that would render the peace and harmonious existence of The Unkempt to one of strife and true ferocity to uphold their promise and ways. <br />
<br />
When human settlers dedicated to the ways of Karana established themselves in The Jaggedpine forest and began to explore the surrounding areas, the unkempt were revealed to the rest of Norrath in flurry of brutal attacks upon any whom entered their territory. Eventually, The Jaggedpine would seal off its entry to the Unkempt Wood, leaving the feral tribe to its own - preserving their own existence and maintaining their ways. <br />
<br />
For years after, the Unkempt seemed to be again at peace. They managed to convert several of The Jaggedpine settlers to their ways before entry was impossible, as well as a few of the scarcely wandering elves who stumbled into the unkempt territory as the years passed both prior and after Wegadas' death. <br />
<br />
Now, they are again in unknown and unspoken turmoil. The Writ of the Wild, the sacred tome of the Unkempt, has been lost. Their ancient vows to The Lujien and Gihjna tribes prevent them from seeking the tome beyond the forest boundaries. <br />
<br />
The better judgement of The Gihjna elders lean away from searching for material possession - for the unkempt know the tome by heart, and they may continue its life and purpose through voice and lessons, as Wegadas had originally intended. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Unkempt Druids <br />
Throughout the Plains of Karana and The Mountains of Rathe, very small bands of human and half elven rangers and druids have laid claim to the unkempt ways. These misguided few have recently been introduced to the true path of the unkempt with the discovery of ancient scrolls believed to be a part of the missing tome bound in a living weave of moss and fern - Writ of the Wild.  <br />
<br />
Few can decipher this tome's ancient symbols, dating back to the era when man was nothing more than groups of nomadic tribes wandering the face of Norrath. The ignorance of the tome's true words and meaning had only strengthened the thirst for the truth of the unkempt ways in these few outcast druids and rangers of the wild. <br />
<br />
Eager to know what secrets the tome would reveal, the outcast druids of Rathe Mountains sought the hermit who dwells in his solitude in the southern plains of Karana. Believed to have been schooled in the ways of the true unkempt in the Unkempt Wood long ago, the hermit was able to translate the fragmented pieces of these ancient documents - although he would lend only a small portion of their knowledge and secrets to the curious outsiders. The hermit gave the select translated passages to the outcast wildlings and sent them away - the originals believed to remain in his possession. <br />
<br />
With only minor portion of the unkempt tome translation, these outcasts began to spread their passion for the wild across all of Norrath, looking to convert any child of the natural world to their cause. From the plains of Karana to the misty forests of the Faydark, the outcast druids and rangers have gained some support, forming a small and sheltered cult dedicated to the vague ways of the unkempt path that they have access to. <br />
<br />
However, the ancient writs' words and guidance were not enough to show these curious and passionate wildlings The true meaning of what it is to be unkempt. Their ignorance may become their downfall, for now they seek to uncover the sacred Unkempt Wood where the ways of the unkempt were born. <br />
<br />
The true followers of the Writ of the Wild are those known as Unkempt Warders, who have not wandered from their homeland of the Unkempt Wood since their founding. Little is known by outsiders of the Unkempt Warders, for they are reclusive by nature and do not seek to venture beyond The boundaries of their cherished and well-guarded territory.</div></div><hr />

Corun Finisc looks at the crystal for a moment; confusion, disgust and curiosity chasing each other across his tired face. After reading the letter, he looks up at you. 'This crystal seems strange, but if you and this Shana believe that it will help, then I know just the person to put it to work.' Corun puts the note and the crystal into a pouch. He reaches into another pouch to retrieve something small and hands it to you. 'This seed was brought to us by a druid of great skill. It should provide the cure we seek, but we do not know the place or circumstances under which to plant it. We have agreed to leave it to you to find that place and that time. I urge you to hasten, we do not know how long it will be until the plague is released upon us in earnest. The only thing that I know is that there may be a link between those that created the disease and the Plane of Discord. A very tenuous link, but keep the seed with you at all times, you never know when you will need it. May the Mother smile on your efforts.'<br />

Since we are searching for the same disease, and we need to identify a person that is somehow involved with it, maybe it's time we turn our eyes to thing in Omens?</div></div><hr />

I take that as the snake is the disease.<br />
 <br />
Or was the wolf actully the disease bringer......... <br />
The way I took the story the fox thru his vanity hinted that he was the source. He a) knew much about how corruption works and b) was doing what corruption does (the story earlier talked about he kept at both sides and had them arguing - breaking order and attacking the strong).  <br />
 <br />
Plus, once he was dead the rain stopped.<br />
 <br />
If that's supposed to be a hint I'd guess that means there's a traitor in the midst, maybe look around in SFG or other druidic places for someone who might be a bert follower in disguise.</div></div><hr />

He a) knew much about how corruption works and b) was doing what corruption does (the story earlier talked about he kept at both sides and had them arguing - breaking order and attacking the strong).  <br />

That's a good point, but to take this a bit further, he incited chaos amongst the meeting.  Chaos is the stuff of Discord.  <br />

Id say look for a named wolf -old and grey- or a snake. Snake might transmit dideases of the skin and be immune cause it sheds its skin<br />

We obviously got to the next part of the epic by talking to two people about Corruption.  Is there not a mob somewhere in the planes named &quot;Corruption&quot;?  Has anyone figured out what that mob is for yet?</div></div><hr />
