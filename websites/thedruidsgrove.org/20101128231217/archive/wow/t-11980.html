Its been a while since I heard a rumor about some enchantment procs changing.  Typically its completely pointless to get a proc style enchant on a druid weapon if you tank or dps.  Did they change this so weapon enchants will proc in feral form?  I couldn't remember if they made that change or not.</div></div><hr />

I noticed in the next expansion there is going to be more character customization options.  Does that mean anything to a Druid?</div></div><hr />

God I hope so... I'm getting sick of staring at the same hairy butt for hours on end.  At least I need a good tattoo or some nice changes to my fur.... come on.  you'd think I'd groom my fur more often :P</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't like us druids, 'cause we take more than an ounce of intelligence to play, and as such are the least played class. I've been on the phone with blizzard support people before and they've out-right told me the only reason for the huge feral nerfs and such was because warriors were complaining about us and that warriors beat our class 3 to 1 in population.</div></div><hr />
