<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-21-2008, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just started doing some PvP mostly to fill time.  I have no clue what stats are important for (feral) PvP.  Obviously +crit, +res, +ap, +str, +sta and +agi.<br />
<br />
But what about +def (does it help?  Or does just the +dodge component of +def help?), +hit, +exp?<br />
<br />
Just trying to figure out what gear in my closet I should be wearing when I PvP since I don't have a &quot;true&quot; PvP set.  Though as soon as 2.4 is released I can grab the (basically) free PvP starter set (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemsets&amp;filter=cl=11;ta=21) that can be purchased from PvE rep vendors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Starting out as feral, your priority should be resil and sta, then ap and agi / crit I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-21-2008, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, +def has no benefit (outside of the +dodge) it offers?  I was looking at PvP gear and I don't see any with +def so I assume that to be true.<br />
<br />
I know quite a few stats behave differently in PvP than in PvE, like weapon skills, etc.  So, +def might fall into that category.<br />
<br />
Wait, +def offers anti-crit just like +res, so maybe +def isn't all that bad for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Res is huge, as it not only reduces your chance to be crit, but also reduces DoT damage on you, and with the incoming mana drain nerf, reduces the amount of mana drained from you.  <br />
<br />
It also depends on your playstyle.  If you want to primarily play kitty in bg's, your priority should be on being stealthy and killing things.  If you want to be a huge ass meat shield and just run in and try to get FF'd in bear, sta and defense wouldn't be a bad idea.  Just that your damage will drop significantly if you stack def over ap and crit.  <br />
<br />
And pug bg's are all about LOLBIGNUMBERS on squishies :P</div></div><hr />
