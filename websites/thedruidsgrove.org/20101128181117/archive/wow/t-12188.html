I only have green items (AH, crafted and a few rewards).  Once I hit lvl 58 should I go to the Outlands?  Or wait until I'm lvl 60?<br />
<br />
With my hunter I waited until I was lvl 60 (just AH/Quest greens) because my buddy was on vacation at the time, plus I wanted to hit 300 in mining before going to the Outlands. And, even as a pair, I found first 15-20 quests in Outlands quite difficult (maybe taxing is a better word) mostly due to the high re-spawn rate and density of mobs (resulting in unwanted adds).<br />
<br />
I'd hate to run into the Outlands with my Druid at lvl 58, only get get my butt kicked all the time.  But, again, I do want to start earning marks ASAP so I can get my Mark of Conquest.  Maybe I'll just complete the quests needed to unlock the PvP daily quest, but continue questing in the old world each day after completing my daily for marks?!?!<br />
<br />
Also, the changes coming in 2.3 may make questing the old world faster?!?!?  As I'm not sure they boosted the quest XP lvl 58-60 Outland quests.</div></div><hr />

Here's a filtered list (http://www.wowhead.com/?npcs&amp;filter=cl=0;minle=56;maxle=60;ra=-1;rh=-1;cr=6;crs=3483;crv=0#0+2+1) from wowhead.  Bonechewer mobs seem like the best fit since they are right out front of Thrallmar.  Or maybe Dreghood mobs?</div></div><hr />

Those damn things stick to you like glue.  And re-spawn so fast, though I don't have skinning on this character, so that may not be much of an issue.<br />
<br />
The boars and the worms were probably what give me the biggest &quot;issues&quot; when I leveled my hunter.<br />
<br />
Since I hit lvl 50 I have had about 0.75 -1.25 levels of rest XP.  So, grinding isn't that bad (though I hate it) of a payoff.  Though at the pace at which I level, I suspect I'll be &quot;in rest&quot; until I'm 70.  I know with my hunter I was in rest XP from 55-70.</div></div><hr />

the old world is just a waste of time at this moment if you want to reach 70!<br />

I assumed it was mostly a re-spawn issue.  As it seemed mobs would come up from behind me all the time.<br />

But now that I have thought about it more, I suspect it won't be as much of an issue with a Druid since...<br />

I soloed a bit around the entrance to Thrallmar killing boars and such for 2 levels. Going at 58 would at least allow you to do the quests that become available.<br />
Since I went so early, I just root/rotted the mobs down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the changes in 2.3 to XP gained per quest and reduced XP per level, I flew thru lvl 56 in 2hours /played.  And I have to be one of the slowest levelers in the world.  Assuming I play 2 hours (real time) the next two nights, I should be lvl 58 Friday evening.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, if I can (thru lvl 60) make a new level in 2-3 nights in old world content, I may just stay the old world.  As, I have to think the XP gains will be a bit slower in the Outlands.  I still need to get my mining skill up to 300 before I do any serious questing in the Outlands.<br />

I don't know....</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not the case at all.  Experience gain in Outlands is exceptionally fast; double that of the old world for killing monsters and turning in quests.  Plus, Outlands is so much.... cooler :p<br />
<br />
I urge anyone in the 55+ range to go to Outland as soon as you can reasonably kill things there.<br />

And with quest XP boosted (by 30%??) for Old World quests levels thru 60, you just might come out ahead with old world content.  The past two nights, I have earned 6K-8K per quest (Felwood, Winterspring).  That is on par with the first few Outland quests.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the Outlands are a much &quot;better&quot; place to play than the old world, I just wonder with the recent changes if they are no longer &quot;the best&quot; for leveling 55-60.<br />
<br />
What I think I'm going to do once I reach lvl 58 is to complete whatever quests are needed to unlock the HFP PvP daily quest (I think it is just 1).  Then do the quest daily, in the meantime, I'm going to work on leveling my mining to 300.  Once I have done that (probably take me close to a week worth of playing), I'll start questing the Outlands.<br />
<br />
Another reason to avoid the Outlands until lvl 60 is you have access to an epic land mount (unless you like PvP and picked one up at 58), being able to outrun mods that are higher level and densely populated is nice.</div></div><hr />

But you earn the money for the epic mount faster in outlands^^</div></div><hr />

I'd head across the portal to do two or three key quests (like the one that gives you the chest piece you'll keep till lvl 70...) and then go back and quest till lvl 61 or 62.  The quest xp in Azeroth is just insane.<br />
<br />
Plus that means an insane amount of spare cash at the end of your lvl 70 run.</div></div><hr />

The XP earned in the old world is insane now.  I have gone thru 4 levels in 6-8 hours (real-time) of questing (54.75-&gt;59.4).  And I cannot emphasize enough how slow of a leveler I am.  I'm sure someone who is actually good at leveling could go from 50-60 in 10 hours /played.  If not less.<br />
<br />
DO NOT GO TO THE OUTLANDS WHEN YOU REACH LVL 58.<br />
<br />
The changes also affect which quests to take.  Pre-2.3, kill quests and drop quests were king because you earned quite a bit of XP from mobs.  Now, I have to think this is less of an issue.  Post-2.3, Quest XP &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mob XP.  So, if you have 30+ mobs to complete a quest A but only to complete quest B, Quest B wins.  Pre-2.3, Quest A would be a better choice.<br />
<br />
BTW, what chest piece are you talking about?</div></div><hr />

I have almost 500g, now.  By the time I get mining to 300, I'll have more than enough for my mount.<br />
<br />
But, in other scenarios, you are correct.  In the Outlands you earn &quot;free&quot; money much quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">11-19-2007, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely agree with you on the quest xp thing.  I am actually quite fast at leveling.  I started yesterday at lvl 46.  In about 4 hours time I did 3.5 levels.  I'm half way to 50 at this point.  50 - 60 in 10 hours would be probably doable if you knew exactly which quests to grab.  Either way I've done like 6-7 levels in only like 7-8 hours played this week on one of my characters.  I'm predicting at my current rate of xp gain I should be done to 60 by the time I hit Winterspring.  That would leave me like Winterspring, EPL, WPL and probably Burning Steppes for some leveling.  There are a lot of tightly packed quests to complete in those zones which should net a good bit of xp.</div></div><hr />

Or did they actually change the XP rewarded by old world quest regardless of your level?  If the later is true, old world questing after reaching lvl 60 would be a good idea, if not, head to the Outlands once you reach 60.</div></div><hr />

I had 2 other quests to turn in.  They appeared to give me more than normal XP.  That said, after I bought my new skills and epic land mount I abandoned all my pre-BC quests and headed to the Outlands.<br />
<br />
I did that for a couple of reasons:  1)  I like the Outlands and feel more comfortable there, 2) Completing quests is actually a joy because the rewards are useful, 3) that's where everyone else is, which makes acquiring in-game friends easier, 4) I want to practice tanking as I haven't done it once yet.  I have a much better chance of tanking a group in the first 2-3 instances in the Outlands than I do tanking any pre-BC instance in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3483#quests) is a list of quests in Hellfire Peninsula.  Note one of the columns shows the experience gain per quest handin.  Also note the large number and (usually) simple nature of the quests (no travelling the world to speak to different NPCs, etc).<br />
<br />
This (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=1377#quests) is the same lineup of quests for Silithus - one of the highest level zones in Azeroth.  Note the experience gains here range from marginally to vastly smaller when compared with that of Hellfire Peninsula.  Some of these quests are much harder to complete; some of them are out of the question totally for someone levelling up as they require reagents from AQ20/40.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, experience gains in Hellfire Peninsula are by and large greater than those of the old world.  A difficult Silithus quest might award 8k experience.  In Hellfire Peninsula you can gain this sort of exp by completing a quest that only requires you to speak to the guy in the next room.<br />
The quest rewards in Hellfire Peninsula are also frequently better than all but the most purple of epics from Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Some people have mentioned that it's better to keep as many Outland quests back as possible until you are level 70, with the idea that these can then be completed for a lot of extra gold.<br />
However, I find daily quests a much more profitable way to earn money, as you can swiftly get into a routine of doing these, and accomplish a large number of daily quests in a very small timeframe.  Even if you level 58-70 purely from quests, it's still highly likely there will be some Outland zones you have barely touched.<br />
<br />
Why not go to Outland as soon as you can?<br />
Outland is where the action is.  The sky looks looker.  People have flying mounts.  Friendly druids swoop in to help when you pull too many shattered hand orcs (well, I do that, at least..)<br />
The experience gain from quests I have demonstrated to be greater than Azeroth.<br />
The quest rewards are vastly superior to almost everything available in Azeroth.<br />

Add 44% to each of the quest and you'll see the difference.  If you want to level fast, pre-BC quests are better.  This isn't about gear.  It is about XP/hour.</div></div><hr />

I have no way of verifying if it also reflects the changes to quests.  I assume so, but I guess WoWhead's staff will give item changes priority over quest changes so I could be wrong.<br />

I still maintain however, that Outland is an order of magnitude cooler than Azeroth ;)<br />

Ex.  Are we there, Yeti? (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=5163) gave me 11.2K XP, WoWhead lists it at 7.7K.<br />
<br />
I have now completed a handful of real (kill/drop) quests in the Outlands all after reaching lvl 60 and wearing several AH purchased BC green items.  I died 4 times and I'm a very cautious quester and flee quickly if things look bad.  Had I been lvl 58, I'm sure I would have died a few more times (I know twice I was down to 4% health).<br />
<br />
The patrols, high density mobs and crazy fast re-spawn rate during those first few quests makes them an order of magnitude harder than other non-group quests.  At least the Horde quests are like that, I assume the Alliance quests are similar.<br />
<br />
Once you get past those first 10-12 &quot;real&quot; quests.  Things get much easier.  In fact, I only remember one other area in which I found a non-group BC quest difficult and those were the ones in that cave in the western side of BEM.  Mind you I have done only a few quests, if any, in Netherstorm and/or SMV with my Hunter as he hit lvl 70 in BEM.</div></div><hr />
