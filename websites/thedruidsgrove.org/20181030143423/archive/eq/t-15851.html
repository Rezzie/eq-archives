Yipee for raiding to get focus effects that extend fully to level 72 spells, when your character is level 80.<br />
 <br />
I hope they modify the way focus effects degrade, to compensate for the fact that level cap increases are now coming twice as often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will probably make it &quot;too&quot; easy to get 5 more levels, anyway, like they did with 70-75. I had my enchanter 1 yellow into 75 recently. I was piling up AA's so fast on her that I didn't really know what to spend them on and I kept hitting the 30 saved cap. So I switched to regular experience while I did some orux pharming missions. Within a couple of days, playing very intermittently whenever I have a spare hour, she's now capped out at max 75.<br />
<br />
I find new levels to be fun: new spells, new aa abilities, new capacities to tackle old content with smaller forces, etc.</div></div><hr />
