<br />
i know the main items are 4 swords and there are mentions of maces for druids and other non sword classes.<br />
<br />
whilst the 1h mace looks fine i would prefer to have a 2h staff....but i cannot find any name to check if it exists and its stats....<br />
<br />
just slightly tempted to give the hilt to new 80 mage so was wondering if a staff was available for my druid b4 i decide.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

more info at http://www.wowwiki.com/The_Return_of_Quel%27Delar_quest_chain<br />
<br />
FWIW the quest chain is pretty cool to do, some interesting lore moments covered there.</div></div><hr />

i'd been searching all over the place to find the rewards and there are several posts about druids etc being able to get a 2h staff.<br />
<br />
the fact that there is not one tbh totally sucks and i /spit at Blizz for the omission of a staff. it makes no sense.<br />
<br />
even more so it sucks when there is not a 2h caster mace but there is a 2h feral mace ?<br />
<br />
wtf !</div></div><hr />

<br />
i bought a hilt a couple weeks back and in the end a few days ago i finally did the quest and got a sword for my Mage.<br />
<br />
then 2 days a go the hilt dropped in Pit and i won the roll with 92 :) so have just done the quests to give my Druid the mace :)<br />
<br />
given i dont raid its the best i can find and am pairing it with the Shriveled Heart from the LK (mage still needs it though!)<br />
<br />
Good quest chain - only takes a couple hours really to do it all, esp as u can run the instances on normal.</div></div><hr />

I had a hilt drop for my pally less than a week after ICC came out, and still haven't had anything better drop for her - they're really nice weapons unless you run a lot of 25s (which I don't).</div></div><hr />

<br />
just need the LK to drop the Heart for my mage :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It dropped at least once for every other character that didn't need it though.  /facepalm</div></div><hr />
