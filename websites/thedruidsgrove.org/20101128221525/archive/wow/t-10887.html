Disregarding what class that flagged person is and what gear he's wearing, what percent of the time will you try to gank them (as a druid)?</div></div><hr />

One-on-one.... with the players within two levels of each other..... is that ganking??  I thought that was 'fair game' :) (unless there is something else in the senario that I'm missing).<br />

I forgot that I was flagged PvP from the night before, and never turned it off.  I saw a flagged Horde player as I went to check the mailbox.  His level was ??<br />

He got me while my back was turned, then took off. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

About a week ago, while grinding in Tanaris, I thought lets have a little fun. So I flagged my self and went about my buisness. <br />
<br />
About a half hour goes by and nothing happens. Alliance all around me and no one will hit me : (  I finally spot a NE rogue that is also flagged. Don't know how it happened but I sneak up to him, wait for the ogre he's fighting to wear him down and pop out and jump him.. Yay.  <br />
<br />
He comes back and does the same to me. We go back and forth for a little while. By the end of the night there are about 20 of us all flagged in Tanaris fighting each other. Most fun I've had in awhile.<br />

Especially with server transfers. <br />
<br />
Malfurion is a pretty new server ( less than 1 yr ).  Recently a horde guild that had downed C'uthn in AQ 40, transfered over ( not the entire guild but a large # of people ).  Overall, their gear is VASTLY superior to that of most of the 60s on the Ally side.<br />
<br />
It has really changed the entire pvp scene.  I just think it's sad that they come over ( regardless of faction ) to pick on the lesser geared and /mock /rolf /lol /spit as they obliderate them.  <br />
<br />
Meh - whatever.  I have ended my PvP grind, unofficially as of 3 weeks ago, officially as of this week.  Now I just pop in for a few games, have some fun and then go run an instance with some friends.  The guild that wants me to join, we cleared 1/2 of ZG on our first run, so I'm looking forward to seeing the &quot;new&quot; content.</div></div><hr />

Don't blame them. They are only finding it funny to enhance their male spirit by killing people that have no chance. It's like playing pacman with a trainer. It makes them feel invincible. :/<br />
<br />
Blame Blizz that took a perfectly nice game and f*cked it over by giving people lvl 90+ gear when they are lvl 60.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeye Goa, blaming blizz and all sucks.. Stop blaming Blizz and be constructive. What do you think they should do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Easy.. raise the lvl cap.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha.  I think that those guys transfered from my server.  The top horde guild, Malicious (or eminent, cant remember) basically broke up and half of them transfered servers to Malfurion...  Changed our PvP seen dramatically too.</div></div><hr />
