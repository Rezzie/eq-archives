We also raid DoN and Relic dragons, and are heading to DSK soonly. I was wondering what I should keep my eyes open, and my dkp ready for? Either from what we're doing now, or DSK.<br />
 <br />
Currently my Shoulders and one ring suck. I'd like to replace the DoN augs I have, as well as some of my weaker slots. I'm also goin to switch out the lifetap aug in my 1.5 for something with some mana. Magelo is in the sig, all suggestions are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I would say anguish helm is must 12% alteration mod is nice.<br />
 <br />
I like the boots if you are using ancient heal and have motp maxxed (I have 30% heals to 75 but still use ancient) and if you get tunic is all the better.<br />
 <br />
If you avoidance is low I like cloak of transgressions but it doesn't have focus effect.<br />
 <br />
Amice of Ill Will is very nice and great focus.<br />
 <br />
If I remember right the relic dragons have wurine guard focus on one of the bracers (stretched back or something)<br />
 <br />
I see you have ALOT of Don focus augs and once you can switch those to hps/mana combo augs the better. (i.e. anguish aug runs, quest ones, hand aug, etc)<br />
 <br />
I would highly recommend an AC aug for your shield.<br />
 <br />
I would pick up all the jewelry (two earrings and rings possible as yours is still one group gear stuff)<br />
 <br />
Yar lir has nice crystallized glass staff with focus for range.<br />
 <br />
I will let others chime in for their ideas.<br />
