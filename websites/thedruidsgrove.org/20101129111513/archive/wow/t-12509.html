On ZA I must use Regrowth, in addition to rejuv/LB, a lot or we risk losing a tank due to spikey dmg.  <br />
<br />
So how do you equip yourself for a raid where you know your mana is going to run short?  Do you switch out +heal for MP5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poysonivy</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I tend to carry some extra mp5 or spirit items with me. Also trying to obtain some cloth items with a lot of +healing could help. <br />
<br />
When I am a main tank healer I rather go for an extra +healing boost and while I am healing the raid I am more mp5 geared so I cast rejuvs, lb's and such on everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elymanrock</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way is Superior Mana Oil  (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22521)on ur weapon. You do have innervate ! Also mana pots<br />
<br />
I OT that bear whilst our prot warrior takes the bleed, So I pop out Regrowth, Rejuv, lifebloomx3, (make sure I am healed), Regrowth. <br />
<br />
You are a Resto, humm yes, maybe be very careful with over stacking regrowth and Rejuv... I'll be best to step out right now, haven't be resto in 2.5 yrs....</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) what consumables are you using in your ZA run, and<br />
<br />
2) what is your rule of thumb for balancing stats in your gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-13-2008, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have a rule of thumb except to maximize healing and mp5, making trade-offs between the two depending on how cool the equipment is.  I'd like a rule of thumb though, I'm definitely kind of guessing sometimes.<br />
<br />
For consumables I'm using either Draeconic Wisdom or the +Healing potion and Golden Fish sticks and superior mana oil.  I just read that the Draconic Wisdom potion is actually better than a regen flask sometimes!<br />
<br />
I think I logged out in my typical healing gear tonight, but with res sickness.<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=The+Scryers&amp;n=Zute<br />
<br />
Right now I'm about 1650 +heal, 207 mp5 in combat<br />
<br />
My blue weapon is being upgraded as soon as the badge vendor is up on our server and that should give me a nice boost to my +heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">04-14-2008, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">^ Where'd you read that Zute?  B/c I just published a post about that last week ... ;)<br />
 <br />
It's good that you're using all of the consumables available to you.  Make sure that you bring along Scrolls of Intellect or Scrolls of Spirit if you don't run with a mage or a priest.<br />
 <br />
I try to keep my healing and mp5 balanced at (very loosely) 10:1 unbuffed.  Before 2.4 I was at about 11:1 (1770:160).  After the patch, I'm sitting at about 9:1 (1860:200).<br />
 <br />
At around 200 mp5 you should easily be raid buffing to over 300 mp5 and should be ending boss fights well above half mana IMO.  I'd definitely switch the focus to healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OH!  Didn't associate the name with the blog, sorry Pookies!  That posting was great, got me to thinking about what to focus on.  The elixir &gt;= Flask is also mentioned in the EJ Tree posting.  http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t17783-druid_raiding_tree/<br />
And I just read to that the Superior Wizard Oil gives +healing even though it doesn't say on the tooltip.  Sooo, I should be be nudging 1900 +heal when buffed to the gills for Gruul's lair anyway.<br />
<br />
Yeah, they said something like go MP5 until you hit 200 then concentrate on +healing until 1800.  <br />
<br />
That helped a lot actually.  I'm over 200 unbuffed, just barely.  And around +1650 healing now.  I decided to swap a few items around and got over 1700 healing and just under 200 mp5.  With raid buffs it was over 1800 healing and 300 mp5.  Very nice!  Still, I was the main tank healer for a VERY long Gruul's fight and I had to chug a pot.  Ok... how can I complain about that?  <br />
<br />
Now, how to fit in things like that Pendant of the Violet Eye (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=28727) into the equation?  Maybe I just need a big spreadsheet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">^ No sweat dude, I was just curious as to whether or not it was the same post, lol.  Props to the author of that EJ post for also mentioning it ... I just like having the math to show.  :)<br />
<br />
Our mana situations just go to show that we could itemize for much less regen and really stack our healing numbers as high as the other classes ... but that is such overkill.  I mean, I'm not having any output problems as things are right now.</div></div><hr />

If you go out of a boss-fight with 50% mana, then u should stack more +heal. Cause every point of mana that u have at the end of a fight, is wasted mana IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah this is basically what i've been trying to follow +spirit &gt; Mp5 based on that recent patch with the whole buff the regen that spirit got, seems like alot of druid friendly items coming with Spirit attached to them already so actively looking for mp5 seems to be more difficult, i'm only speaking from what i've seen so far but i find its easier to get +spirit gear then mp5. Does anyone happen to know the the Spirit = mp5 conversion is? is it like 5/1? or am i being too generous?</div></div><hr />

She has quite a bit of theorycrafting on her site (she just changed hosting providers, so the site might be up/down a bit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grynyr</div><div class="date">06-03-2008, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I evaluate gear based solely on my mana regen performance in raids.  As long as you can finish every fight in your raids with a little mana left over, stack +heal as much as you can.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself running out of mana, add spirit/intelligence or pure mp5 to get to the point that you don't run out of mana, then go back to +heal.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that when I say &quot;mana left over&quot; I mean after using pots on every cooldown and your innervate on yourself.<br />
<br />
Recently I noticed that I always ended boss fights at 30% or more mana left, so I regemmed all of my +spirit and +mp5 gems to +heal gems.  Unfortunately, I still end fights with 30% mana left 8/</div></div><hr />

We're just nipping into T6 a bit.  Based on Resto4Life's mana regen calculator I've decided to go for more Int so I can get more mana when I innervate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently I Innervate myself when I cant cast a LB anymore due to no mana, I continue casting after I start the innervate and usually have 5-8 seconds left on the Innervate when I'm full mana.</div></div><hr />
