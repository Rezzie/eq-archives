I have got 1 in about 16 hours of farming. WTF SONY! These waters are also for the berserker epic 1.5. Why is the drop rate such frigging crap? I am so pissed at this bs. I have worked countless hours raising my tradeskills to 230+ and getting Elemental flagged and then I can't even get the drops needed? <br />

They are easy to split if u use snare and the zoneout if u pull more than u can handle.<br />
