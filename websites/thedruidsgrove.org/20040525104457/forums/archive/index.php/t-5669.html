<br />
Gods, the finale of the fourth season was just a jaw dropper, especially knowing as I watched it that it was ending, presumably with no hope of continuation.<br />
<br />
/cheers to the fans for keeping hope alive.  JMS would be proud /wink<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sobe Silvertree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Must say - I was finally getting into Farscape and BAM they were killing it - Thank the Sci-Fi Gods that they kept SG1 - I can't live w/o my daily Fix!<br />
<br />
Bab5 was another one - I still Tivo it every chance I can (daily currently on Sci-fi 9:00am EST (thx /hugs my TiVo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm waiting to see what they do with that Battlestar Galactica mini-series they made which starts in December.<br />
<br />
Its a damned shame that crap like Xena, Hercules, and Tarzan can make it to prime time cable, but the only decent (and I use the term loosely) Sci-Fi you can find are the various Star Trek spawns.  I'd love to see a good Battlestar Galactica or Buck Rodgers remake take the place of Charmed or whatever Buffy spin off they are currently on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">...or whatever Buffy spin off they are currently on.<br />
<br />
Bahh!  The only Buffy spin off is Angel.  Buffy rocked.  So does Angel.  Joss Whedon is brilliant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Last night's Angel was especially good.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Mountain Dew!&quot;<br />
<br />
On a side note I've also read that Family Guy may be getting another 30-some odd episodes ordered, due to amazing DVD sales.<br />
<br />
And hopefully the West Wing will never need any rescuing!  8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ooh, more Family Guy...<br />
<br />
Now we just need the same to happen to Futurama! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Weird, I knew I made this thread, but couldnt find it by searching for &quot;Farscape.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway!  Small update!<br />
<br />
http://filming.fto.nsw.gov.au/content.asp?content=7&amp;Id=76<br />
<br />
Under Telefilms:<br />
<br />
<br />
FARSCAPE MINI-SERIES<br />
TYPE: Telemovies (2 x 2 hr)<br />
PRODUCTION COMPANY: Farscape Mini-Series Productions<br />
PHONE: 8748 9299<br />
START SHOOT: 15/12/03<br />
WRAP: 15/3/04<br />
<br />
<br />
There you have it, it's currently being shot down there in New South Wales.  Two 2-hour episodes.  Yay!<br />
<br />
On a sad side note, Angel was cancelled this past weekend, and will not be returning for another season.  At least they were intentionally given a lot of advance notice so they have time to wrap up the series properly (unlike what happened to Farscape.)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>King Burgundy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, The thing is, they only had 8 episodes left, and they had already filmed at least 4 of them...  So I'm not sure if you could say, under normal circumstances, that they had enough time.  :(   However, having said that.  Check out this Whedon post:<br />
http://www.spoilerslayer.com/archives/002782.php<br />
<br />
Its really sad actually that all of Whedon's shows keep disappearing.  And I have a strange theory that it is all Ben Edlund(of the Tick)'s fault.  First, The Tick gets cancelled.  Then he writes and produces on Firefly with Whedon and that gets cancelled.  Then he starts writing on Angel in season 5 and that gets cancelled!!  :(<br />
<br />
--  On the farscape thing...  Yay :)<br />
<br />
--And since you had also mentioned JMS in the first post...  Jeremiah is dead now too, but thats kind of old news.  But some new B5 thing is in the works at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>nieros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All I got to say is &quot;woot&quot; :)<br />
