Also, they will become immune if you cast it on them too many times.  It's possible that the Tauren was either bubbled or already in a cyclone as well.</div></div><hr />

I didn't see one, but that prolly means it was behind him and I couldn't see it.</div></div><hr />

Cyclone is extremely potent in PvP imo. Anyway, is it on the same dim return as roots?<br />
