Currently for pvp i'm speced cat as an obvious choice but the other day i noticed my maul criting for 2.5k in my unimpressive gear. Has anyone tried bear spec as a pvp tank? I'm sure catform is still obviously way more burst damage but still at 2.5k criting maul, bear form seems like it might be more usable in those large cluster F@#$s in BGs. Currently without bear talent specs its lost alot of its former defense it seems but that might just be because everyone hits like a truck now.</div></div><hr />

In bg's I've had some success going bear with Glyph of Maul, Berserk, and infinite target Swipe.  I certainly survive longer than I do in cat, but it serves little purpose unless I am surrounded by other folks that can take advantage of the slow damage I am doing and the distraction I provide with Maul and Bash.</div></div><hr />
