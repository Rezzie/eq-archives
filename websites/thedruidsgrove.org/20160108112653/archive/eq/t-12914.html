I have to date done:<br />

Woushi<br />
Venril Sathir<br />
Talendor<br />

Goreanaire<br />

Zlandicar<br />
Taskmaster Abott in GD<br />
Various yard trash in several higher end zones.<br />
<br />
Suggestions on what I could attempt next?<br />
<br />
Zlandicar was probly the closest fight that I've had, but I think I worked out a way to make it go a tad easier next time.  <br />

Was enjoyable. Rhag 2 is actually close one still. I win, but depending on crits and stuff, at 1-10% mana. I don't think any other nameds in Ssra are soloable yet.<br />
 <br />
Wall of Slaughter nameds are tough fights for me, but winnable.<br />
 <br />
Oh, fun fights were Praesartiums in Sanctus Seru. Took me several hours to kill 3 of them. Couldn't snare 4th and didn't have time to experiment more with him. These are Seru key mobs.<br />
 <br />
What else.. oh, right. I have yet to try, but I think the first named in Sleepers is soloable.<br />
 <br />
BTW, I really wouldn't compare our soloing ability with clerics. Guildy cleric got Shadowhunter to 24%, having 40% mana left himself, then SH despawned.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure i could get to his room solo, And if I could, granted the room is large enough to kite but I hav eno way of spliting the mobs.<br />

VS procs Deadly Lifetap:  http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=993&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
He hits around 235 and is very resistant so you need to debuff him before landing spells.  If you perfer fire, Hand of Ro is good.  If you perfer Magic, a Tash stick out of Sebilis helps withthe swarm DoTs (which he does resist fairly often).<br />
<br />
My Personal Damage shield is 89 Base<br />
<br />
+5 from Belt<br />
+8 from 8th Ring<br />
*4 for Cloak of Thorns<br />
+ Nettlecoat and Nettleshield.<br />
<br />
I also have Spirit of the Grove Maxed, with Full AA Extension.<br />
<br />
I have Omens Avoidance AA and PoP Mitigation AA Completed.<br />
<br />
The issue with the lifetap, is its partially resistable, so it may not land for the full 1500, but he might still regain say 600 hitpoints.  This makes having very high MR nessercary.  My Selfbuffed MR ranges from 540ish to 575 - depending on if I use infusion.  (9 more missions till Mask clicky).<br />
<br />
It took me awhile to figure out how to kill him, basically you need to live while taking hits (and possiably lifetaps) and Deal enough damage to him to kill him (He has appox 18k hp).  This may seem simple but he procs the lifetap enough to make it fairly difficult.<br />
<br />
The other thing I noticed, is he is fairly streaky.  Sometimes when I fight him everything lands right off and other times he resists everything reguardless of how much I debuff him.<br />
<br />
Typically when I fight him I pull with Hand of Ro and land a few DoTs (click, Vengance, etc) I will also click my Epic and Try to nuke him for the first 30 seconds.  After that I tend to focus more on keeping him debuffed and DoTd. - I also use my Hammer of Hours, go go Melee Druid Time Laspe Procs!<br />
<br />
This is the only one I can't kill consistantly  the RNG seems really against me.  I can tank him while over 10 minutes no problem, its dealing enough damage to offset his Hitpoints + Lifetap.<br />
<br />
One minor note, he is MUCH harder then VSR.  VSR casts the Lifetap, and VS procs it - making it a much more difficult fight.<br />

The only reason they can do that is because I believe they can somehow FD kite it. I'm not entirely sure, perhaps a necro can explain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have solo`d zelithak myself, he's more difficult than any mob you listed. I know a necro and ranger who have solo`d Tallon, so it's possible for druid. You can get to Tallon without killing anything too if your savvy with your walk.<br />
<br />

VZ currently can't be done by a druid.<br />
 <br />
Few to no druids have the gear setup to solo vindi atm. Once a druid with great latent DS and DS clickies gets a huge mana pool and lots of DP armor I'ld say it'ld be a for sure win if they can get vindi solo*.<br />
 <br />
*iirc the giants in the hall by WL side aren't social with vindi. I remember pulling him WL ent once and he was left there as a solo pull more or less, so perhaps thats a possiblity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's probably how it is done. The first necro who did it admits he got VERY lucky the first time he did it, and a couple since then have soloed VZ. I'm looking forward to an attempt myself soon.</div></div><hr />
