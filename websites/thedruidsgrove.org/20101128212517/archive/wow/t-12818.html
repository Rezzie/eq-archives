It is the single greatest talent in the entire tree, especially for cats.  60 free energy every 30s.  Sure it is even better for PvP, but it is still nice in PvE, though you can't use it until your tank builds up some threat.<br />
<br />
I think it is a better talent than Berserk.  I sort of feel like we got the shaft with our 51 point talent.</div></div><hr />

Unless, of course, you expect to have a Resto druid in your group all the time.<br />
<br />
Here's the new version of Furor...<br />
Gives you 100% chance to gain 10 Rage when you shapeshift into Bear and Dire Bear Form, and you keep up to 100 of your Energy when you shapeshift into Cat Form, and increases your total Intellect while in Moonkin form by 10%.<br />
Found in the last blue post in this thread. (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9023610487-energy-regen-change--intended.html)<br />
<br />
Remember that in LK, you constantly gain energy while in any form.  Which is sweet for leveling, as you can now use travel form, etc. to run short distances, shift to cat and mangle away without waiting for energy.  This will be a boon for kitty pvp as well (bear, bash, back to cat with nearly full energy bar.  roots, cyclone back to cat with full energy bar, etc.).  And to a lesser extent in PvE as you can now use your CC, shift to cat to dps, shift out to re-CC, shift back to cat.  The whole time gaining energy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still want to keep Furor as my preferred pve game-experience is DPS with off-healing.  So not losing energy while I ping off a quick heal on my rogs will be nise :&gt;  For pvp, it will still be awesome because it allows insta-bash.<br />

And you'd still have the benefit of 2/2 iMotW which is +14 stats, +400 armor and +xx res over the normal rank 9 MotW.  On everyone in your party.  As it currently stands, only Resto Druids will take 2/2 iMotW as Balance druids now get a boost to int with Furor.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  Not sure how well it will work in practice.</div></div><hr />

Which means we will actually have to make some decisions in LK.  Though I expect we will see 1-2 more talent tree changes before LK is released.  From reading the blue posts, it certainly seems like they are &quot;not done&quot; with Druids, Rogues and Warriors.  Since we will use rogue gear and possibly share non-set items with warriors, I suspect druids will be one of the last classes to get fine tuning.  Or worst, forgotten.</div></div><hr />

<br />
was this intended just for druids or other/all classes ?<br />
<br />
it would help everyone and stop an issue that's cropped up for us recently whereby a priest who usually pvp's says they can no longer afford to respec everyday from pvp to heroic and back to pvp.<br />
<br />
ie they would be respeccing once per day as they mainly do pvp/arean not having much of an interest in raiding 3/4 times a week for 4 hrs at a time but they enjoy coming to some heroics in a small grp.<br />
<br />
as of last nite they are not going to be coming with us as pvp is their main focus. not heroics. so they stay as pvp spec most of the time.</div></div><hr />

The fact that have have been really quite about it, makes me think it will happen.  It will be one of the surprise features when LK is released.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't like it.  As it allows an even smaller group of elite players to consume raid spots, arena, etc.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope they put some type of long cooldown (hour? once per day?) on the ability.  If you can switch every time you are out of combat, it will have a huge negative impact on the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-05-2008, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't see them making it an insta-swap type thing. I would assume that there would be some sort of CD associated with swapping specs. <br />
<br />
The reason they would do it is exactly what Kheldar said. Unfortunatley there is such a disparity between arena / pvp specs and raiding specs for most classes that there is little if any crossover. Resto druids and holy pallies to a lesser extent being probably the only exceptions.  It is tough spending 300 - 500g weekly to be able to be productive at more than just one aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
WoW seems like it is going to become amazingly homogenous with the xpac anyway, with multiple classes having the same buffs, be able to heal the same, be able to tank the same, etc. I kinda liked the differences between classes, and the dynamic that brought to raiding / pvp. Personally I really liked it when alliance didnt have shamans and horde didnt have paladins. Gave the game more of an 'us and them' feel. Same thing with pvp and pve sets looking different way back when - there used to be more of a unique feel to each class / faction. Blizz wants to make it so everyone can get everything and everyone can do everything. Which is a good move on their part I suppose...</div></div><hr />

And for that it makes sense.  But I'm concerned about the impact it would have on those who have dual PvE specs? I could be feral and resto?  If I'm a cool person and today we have an extra tank, do I end up replacing our normal healer because he isn't our RL &quot;friend&quot;?<br />
<br />
Now if they want to make such that you have PvE and a PvP specs and the later is only active in BGs and Arenas and optionally in world environment.  And the moment you step into an instance your PvE spec becomes active.  I would be fine with that.</div></div><hr />

then our 'other' priest could spec holy and heal us in heroics which is what she is up for doing - but at the same time have a pvp spec as she does a lot of arena.</div></div><hr />

That's 10 expertise - NOT expertise rating - which will significantly boost your aggro, make your hits more reliable, and increase mitigation somewhat.<br />

But I will go with something different while leveling.<br />
<br />
I'll start at lvl 70 with this build (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=5030321323222100531003003105000550001000000  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000).  Then take Berserk at 71 followed by 4/5 PI.  Then, I'll respec to pickup 5/2 MS (dropping PI), and continue back in feral tree until I reach 80.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that that leveling scheme ought to give me enough tanking talents to tank pre-80 5-mans yet still give me plenty of solo DPS for questing.  Once I get to 80, I respec (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=5030321323222103531003533130120350001000000  0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) for a bit more tanking at the cost of some DPS (namely 5/2 MS).</div></div><hr />

Since seeing the itemisation in WotLK, I have revised my opinion on this talent.  Since most items seem to have expertise rating on them already, I don't really see that 10 expertise from 2 talent points is an efficient spend for a bear-spec druid.<br />

It should be noted that the current T7.10 set does not have any +hit on it, but lots of +exp.  exp &gt; hit for bears and solo cats, but for PvE cats hit &gt; exp.  And you'll need some hit to boost your DPS.  I hope it comes from non-set pieces.<br />

I found my rotations while leveling used a lot of Mangle.  Cutting the cost of Mangle combined with heavy use of Tiger's Fury (which is god like in my opinion) and a shorter cooldown meant I rarely shifted out to heal myself.  Things just died way way too fast.<br />

For perspective I have mostly T4 gear.  I have a few select pieces from ZA (like one piece) and I have like one or two pieces of badge gear (like the staff).  I'm not overflowing in super awesome T6 gear (like the people who seem to flood the beta servers for whatever reason...).  Things died fast and I was replacing gear pretty early so I could test the new stats like haste and the agility heavy rogue gear.</div></div><hr />

In our current state in the beta GC has stated that they are concerned we would be the tank of choice for raids due to what would become vastly superior mitigation by Naxx.  They are tuning our mitigation by reducing our multiplier (down to 370% last I read) and by tweaking PotP.<br />
<br />
The PotP tweak has resulted in howls of protest due to it simultaneously nerfing both our physical damage mitigation AND our magical mitigation, which to my knowledge was not shown to be a problem.  We are at a severe disadvantage to the other classes with regard to magical mitigation (it's a DK speciality, warriors have spell reflect, I forget the pally equivalent), so people are screaming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
guess i need to do more digging/reading to fully understand what and why wrt to reducing our multipliers :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-05-2008, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the issue is that they like how much damage the other tanks are taking, but they don't like that we aren't taking that much damage.  We probably make doing Naxx a breeze.<br />
<br />
The only issue I have is that most other tanks are going to scale at the far end where we tend to not scale as well.  Without the armor we don't scale and the warriors get their next new sexy sheild and add 4k armor to themselves... um and what do we get?  Rogue leather....</div></div><hr />

One thing I would seriously like to understand is why Blizzard refuses to give us parry or block.  NPC animal forms can both parry and block, and we can't?  Makes no sense whatever to me.<br />
<br />
It would give bears so many more scaling options and create more opportunities for character customization.</div></div><hr />

This is an intended nerf (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10535473265-feral-tanking-nerf-actually-a-buff.html). Obviously this throws a slight wrench into my previous build, and until I figure out whether or not we are having a Warrior run with us all the time in Naxx, I'm not sure whether I want to commit points to FA or IW. Regardless, right now I'm probably looking at 0/60/11. If we do end up running with a Warrior: this (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGGsfrkceRc0uAo0E0z).</div></div><hr />
