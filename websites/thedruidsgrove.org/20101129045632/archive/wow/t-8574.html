The thing that really gets me is that Blizzard is taking the same approach as SOE in terms of communication (a.k.a. brief, generalized messages on a website that is virtually inaccessible when servers are down) even though their subscriber base is 3X the size in a more competitive landscape.  <br />
<br />
SOE had the excuse that they were the only real game in town.  Blizzard, while clearly the best option right now IMO, is creating a market vulnerability where they really should be building an unassailable franchise.  And the thing is, it takes so LITTLE effort to communicate with the community.  Post messages to other fansites.  Send out emails.  Buy more bandwidth.  Do something so that if (when) outages happen the players can stay informed.  <br />
<br />
Blizzard can sure make games, but they are missing a huge opportunity to &quot;do it right&quot; and entrench their position as the #1 MMO name.  Their loss.</div></div><hr />

Gives credence to the theories that they are using that as a way to limit the complaints on the forums. You think the whining is bad now? Imagine if people could log in and post all the time.</div></div><hr />
