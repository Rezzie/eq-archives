I know I made this run with the help of a couple more experienced players, and they've assured me that the quests are more plentiful in this area. <br />
<br />
What do you all think?</div></div><hr />

However, if you run out of human quests, you can go do dwarf quests pretty easily.  It's a little bit more of a hassle to do such in night elf lands since you have to travel further.<br />
<br />
However, I love the ambiance of the night elf areas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">05-16-2005, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm playing through again with my lowbie gnome mage and to me it feels like the human/dwarf areas are much more &quot;condensed&quot; than the night elf area.  I hate Auberdine's configuration of the long zone - every other quest seems to have you running the breadth of the zone.  Most of the Stormwind quests are very &quot;hub and spoke&quot; configured - one central quest location and the mobs are outside from there.  Not only that, but the griff flights in this area seem to make a whole lot more sense (see: direct) than in and from Auberdine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tygre</div><div class="date">05-17-2005, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have any free time, might I suggest researching the quests for any particular zone you may be in for said level range.  Great info can be found at Allakhazam's or Thottbot.  By doing so you can prevent much of the &quot;running around&quot; you get in many of these larger/odd shaped zones.  Darkshore quests for instance can be made in figure 8's.  For example, head south to do some remains/murloc quests, head east inland to do some furbog/animal quests, and then by that time your bags are full it's time to head back north to Auberdine for turn-ins/selling.  Another round may take you on a north loop, etc.  Rinse and repeat.  Up until the 45ish zones, only the Barrens has been difficult for me to become quest efficient on any of my characters.<br />

Just my handful of coppers worth.</div></div><hr />
