<br />
Speak to Helendis Riverhorn at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
Life in the Burning Steppes is rife with conflict.<br />
<br />
Just look at this place! We know very little of what happened to these buildings, but we do know that at one time, before the great explosion, this was all part of the Redridge mountain range.<br />
<br />
Enough lamenting! We have a problem. You may have noticed the dragonkin below this ridge. We need assistance in pushing them back. Kill as many as you can and return to me. Succeed and perhaps we can talk of other things. <br />
<br />
Slay 15 Black Broodlings, 10 Black Dragonspawn, 4 Black Wyrmkin and 1 Black Drake. Return to Helendis Riverhorn when the task is complete.<br />
<br />
Kill 20 elite Black Dragonkin in Burning Steppes.  The Dragonkin are in camps around the zone and range in level from 48-54.  As a Druid these can be soloable but it will go faster with a group.<br />
<br />
Return to Helendis Riverhorn when complete.<br />
<br />
Quest 2 - The True Masters<br />
<br />
Speak to Helendis Riverhorn at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
We had always assumed that the Blackrock orcs were a product of their savage upbringing. What we have found here, in their homeland, tells us another story.<br />
<br />
Indeed, it is bloodlust and thirst for conflict that empowers them, but the black dragonflight are the beings whom control the orcs of Blackrock. We suspect that it is the black dragonflight that fuels them with rage and hostility.<br />
<br />
Take this letter to Magistrate Solomon. He will know what must be done.<br />
<br />
Travel to Lakeshire and deliver Helendis Riverhorn's Letter to Magistrate Solomon.<br />
<br />
Take Helendis's Letter to Magistrate Solomon at the Town Hall of Lakeshire in Redridge Mountains.<br />
<br />
Quest 3 - The True Masters<br />
<br />
Speak to Magistrate Solomon in the town hall of Lakeridge in Redridge Mountains.<br />
<br />
This is grim news. To discover that our mortal enemies are merely pawns of a much greater threat is disheartening. There is no possible way that Lakeshire could survive an attack from both the Blackrock orcs and the black dragonflight. Should Lakeshire fall to this menace, Darkshire would fall next, and then what? Goldshire? Stormwind itself?<br />
<br />
You must take this information to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind at once! If this does not merit the aid of Stormwind, nothing will and all is lost. <br />
<br />
Travel to Stormwind and deliver Solomon's Plea to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon.<br />
<br />
Bolvar resides in Stormwind Keep. <br />
<br />
Take Solomon's Plea to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind.  The Highlord is located in the center room of Stormwind Keep beside the boy king.<br />
<br />
Quest 4 - The True Masters<br />
<br />
Speak to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon at the keep in Stormwind.<br />
<br />
Solomon paints a dreary picture. Still, we cannot afford to send our thinly spread troops to the aid of Lakeshire on speculation. I will need proof of these claims before I can act.<br />
<br />
Speak with Lady Prestor, &lt;Name&gt;. She is a learned woman and knows much of dragons and dragonkin. She may be able to shed some light on this situation. <br />
<br />
Speak with Highlord Bolvar Fordragon after speaking with Lady Katrana Prestor.<br />
<br />
Speak to Lady Katrana Prestor at the keep in Stormwind, listen to here story and then speak to Highlord Bolvar again.<br />
<br />
Quest 5 - The True Masters<br />
<br />
Speak to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon at the keep in Stormwind.<br />
<br />
I am going to empower you as an acting deputy of Stormwind.<br />
<br />
Return to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire and deliver this decree.<br />
<br />
Take Bolvar's Decree to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire. <br />
<br />
Take Bolvar's Decree back to Magistrate Solomon at the town hall of Lakeridge in Redridge Mountains.<br />
<br />
Quest 5 - The True Masters<br />
<br />
Speak to Magistrate Solomon at the town hall of Lakeridge in Redridge Mountains.<br />
<br />
You must return to the Burning Steppes. As a deputy of Stormwind, you will be required to report to Marshal Maxwell. Good luck.<br />
<br />
Speak with Marshal Maxwell in the Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
Return to Marshal Maxwell at Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes<br />
<br />
Quest 6 - The True Masters <br />
<br />
Speak with Marshal Maxwell at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
What? You thought you were the first? How many soldiers must we lose before Stormwind acts?<br />
<br />
We had accumulated enormous amounts of intelligence pertaining to the Blackrock menace before we lost our commanding officer, Marshal Windsor. With Marshal Windsor went all of our precious information.<br />
<br />
What we need is that documentation. Speak with Ragged John. He was with Windsor when they were attacked by a Blackrock raiding party. He was last seen in a cave to the north.<br />
<br />
Speak with Ragged John to learn of Marshal Windsor's fate and return to Marshal Maxwell when you have completed this task.<br />
<br />
You recall Marshal Maxwell telling you to search for him in a cave to the north.<br />
<br />
Find Ragged John at Flame Crest cave in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
Quest 7 - Marshal Windsor<br />
<br />
Speak with Ragged John at Flame Crest cave in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
So that good for nothing coward says that Windsor is alive, eh?<br />
<br />
Suit up, deputy, you are going in to find him. If Windsor is alive, you are to bring him back. If he's dead, I want proof.<br />
<br />
I bet you are getting tired of hearing that, aren't you?<br />
<br />
Travel to Blackrock Mountain in the northwest and enter Blackrock Depths. Find out what became of Marshal Windsor.<br />
<br />
You recall Ragged John talking about Windsor being dragged off to a prison.<br />
<br />
Take a group into BlackRock Depths and locate Marshall Windsor.<br />
<br />
http://www.ultimategamers.com/worldofwarcraft/blackrockdepths.html<br />
<br />
Marshal Windsor is locked in a cell in the Dwarven Prison area of Blackrock Depths (area 20 on linked map).  To get to him you will either need a Rogue with sufficent picklock skill or you'll need the Prison Cell key that drops off High Interrogator Gerstahn.  The prison block is the loop of cells on the right hand side of the First Room in the dungeon; with the Interogators room in the center.  I believe Marshall is in the 2nd openable cell on the left when entering the left (top) side of the loop. <br />
<br />
Unlock Windsors cell and speak to him.<br />
<br />
Quest 8 - Abandoned Hope<br />
<br />
Speak to Marshal Windsor in his Prison Cell in Blackrock Depths<br />
<br />
Bolvar is a fool. I was gathering his precious 'proof' so that I could shove it down his throat.<br />
<br />
He is a blind buffoon. Proof stands two feet away from him and he does not see.<br />
<br />
As for my data, it's lost. Gone. Unrecoverable.<br />
<br />
Should I ever find Ironfoe and make it out of this labyrinth, my first stop will be Stormwind, to place my hammer in between that reptile's eyes.<br />
<br />
Leave me.<br />
<br />
Give Marshal Maxwell the bad news.<br />
<br />
Return to Marshal Maxwell at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
Quest 9 - A Crumpled Up Note<br />
<br />
At this point the quest series seems to end with no indication of what to do next.  But it continues.  Return to Blackrock Depths with a group and find &quot;A <br />
Crumpled Up Note&quot; as a random drop.  The note can drop off any mob in the dungeon, so just start clearing the jail area and you should find one.  Once you've gotten the not read it to start this portion of the quest.<br />
<br />
The note has stains covering its surface. The text is barely legible, but you make out the following:<br />
<br />
...sweet irony...<br />
<br />
...the fall of the broken Alliance...<br />
<br />
...if it were not for General Angerforge's diligence, we may have never discovered the pattern to the encryption...<br />
<br />
...Argelmach is almost done with the decryption of Windsor's notes.<br />
<br />
Our lord will rise from the depths and crush any that remain...<br />
<br />
-Emperor Dagran Thaurissan<br />
<br />
You may have just stumbled on to something that Marshal Windsor would be interested in seeing. There may be hope, after all.<br />
<br />
Take the note to Marshal Windsor in his jail Cell in Blackrock Depths.<br />
<br />
Quest 10 - A Shred of Hope<br />
<br />
Speak to Marshal Windsor in his jail cell in Blackrock Depths.<br />
<br />
Do you realize what this means?<br />
<br />
Perhaps all is not lost! From what I can ascertain, the information is being held by two Dark Iron dwarves: General Angerforge and the golem lord, Argelmach. I have a feeling that they won't just hand over the information if we ask nicely.<br />
<br />
I hope you are ready to battle.<br />
<br />
Venture forth and find these two villains! Destroy them and return my lost information.<br />
<br />
Return Marshal Windsor's Lost Information.<br />
<br />
Marshal Windsor believes that the information is being held by Golem Lord Argelmach and General Angerforge.<br />
<br />
http://www.ultimategamers.com/worldofwarcraft/blackrockdepths.html<br />
<br />
Marshal Windsor's Lost Information is in two parts.  One half drops off General Angerforge (location 7 on linked map) The other drops from Golem Lord Argelmach (location 8 on the linked map).  The General is a 57 Elite Dwarf with 4 non elite guards.  When he reaches 25% health he calls for help and that brings additional adds that may include Elite Medics.  A good strategy is to AOE the non elites while a tank stays on the General.  The Golem Lord is a 57 Elite Dwarf with 2 Elite (non banishable) Guards.  He also calls for help which will adds from the Manufactory outside his room if you didn't clear them all first.<br />
<br />
Once you have the two pieces of information return them to Marshal Windsor in his jail cell in Blackrock Depths.<br />
<br />
Quest 11 - Jail Break<br />
<br />
Speak to Marshal Windsor in his jail cell in Blackrock Depths<br />
We need to get out of here. Help me get my gear back from the supply area and free my friends. If we make it out of here, you are to proceed to Morgan's Vigil and speak with Marshal Maxwell. He will give you further instruction.<br />
<br />
Help Marshal Windsor get his gear back and free his friends. Return to Marshal Maxwell if you succeed.<br />
<br />
This is an escort quest.  You must keep Marshal Windsor alive get his items from the supply room and free his friends from the cell block on the oppisite side of the entrance room.  <br />
<br />
The best way to do this escort is to pre clear all mobs from the jail area; both the left and the right sides of the dungeons first room.  Once the area up to the ring of Law is clear start the escort and follow Windsor to the supply room. Once Windsor is equipped he is a powerful fighter, though fairly suicidal as he will attack anything he sees if you didn't clear it before hand. Follow Windsor across the main room to the second set of cells to release his friends.  Everytime Windsor asks you to open a door be prepared for a fight.  <br />
<br />
Once you have finished the Escort go speak to Marshal Maxwell at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
Quest 12 - Stormwind Rendevous<br />
<br />
Speak to Marshal Maxwell at Morgan's Vigil in Burning Steppes.<br />
<br />
You are to meet with Windsor at the gates of Stormwind.<br />
<br />
What Windsor is about to unveil will shake the very foundation of the kingdom!<br />
<br />
Do not attempt to venture there alone. You must amass an army! Gather your compatriots. To arms! <br />
<br />
Travel to Stormwind City and venture to the city gates. Marshal Windsor will meet you just inside the city borders.<br />
<br />
This quest and the following one are raid quests so gather an army and head to Stormwind!<br />
 <br />
Quest 13 - The Great Masquerade<br />
<br />
Find Reginald Windsor at the gates of Stormwind<br />
<br />
It has been quite the adventure, friend. I owe you a great debt of gratitude. Perhaps, when all is said and done...<br />
<br />
As you have no doubt ascertained by now, Lady Prestor is Onyxia: Brood of Deathwing, twin to the tyrant of the Spire, Nefarian.<br />
<br />
For too long she has held our kingdom in her captivating gaze. Even the Highlord is controlled by her trickery - a puppet. It all ends today... The spell will be broken.<br />
<br />
Worry not, for together, we shall be victorious!<br />
<br />
Are you ready?<br />
<br />
Follow Reginald Windsor through Stormwind. Protect him from harm!<br />
<br />
Escort Reginald Windsor through Stormwind.  <br />
<br />
Windsor will stop and speak to several people along the way as the Stormwind Guards stand down to allow the heroes to pass. There are no fights between the gates and the keep.  At the entrance to the Keep Windsor will stop and wait for your group to be ready to enter.  Speak to him when ready to procede.<br />
<br />
Once you enter the keep and procede to the Kings dias Windsor will unveil Lady Katrana Prestor to be none other than Onyxia herself!  She has taken control of Stormwind and Placed High Lord Bolvar Fordragon under a charm.  Once she is revealed she will turn into a Dragonkin Onyxia and summon Dragonkin Gaurds. Onyxia will bolt Windsor killing him quickly, and then teleport out of the battle.  Once the guards have been slain she teleports away and disappears.  You will then need to speak to High Lord Bolvar Fordragon who is no longer under Onyxia's Charm.<br />
<br />
Quest 14 - The Dragon's Eye<br />
<br />
Speak to High Lord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind Keep.<br />
<br />
A fragment of the shattered medallion is all that I can offer.<br />
<br />
You must find another of dragon blood willing to assist you in forging a new key. Once you secure this key, you must travel to the Wyrmbog in Dustwallow Marsh. It is there that you will find her lair, &lt;Name&gt;.<br />
<br />
Where to find other flights willing to help? Sadly, I do not know... They are said to exist. Some may even work and live among us, disguised as one of the humanoid races. I wish you luck. <br />
<br />
You must search the world for a being capable of restoring the power to the Fragment of the Dragon's Eye. The only information you possess about such a being is that they exist.<br />
<br />
Take the Fragment of the Dragon's Eye to Haleh in Winterspring.<br />
<br />
Haleh is found by using a teleport rune in the blue Dragon caves of Winterspring. The Dragon Cave is found in the Mazthoril portion of Winterspring and is guarded by Elite Blue Dragonkin.  As a Druid you can reach her easily solo by prowling through the dragonkin to the bottom of the cave.  At the bottom of the cave you will see a pink rune on the ground, change to casterform and use the rune to teleport to Haleh.<br />
<br />
Quest 15 - Drakefire Amulet<br />
<br />
Speak to Haleh in Winterspring<br />
<br />
It is a piece of the dragon; a scale - enchanted and transformed. Whole, it could have granted access to the beast's lair. Shattered, it is useless.<br />
<br />
It is possible to repair the item, but to do so would require the blood of a black dragon champion. There is one... He is known as General Drakkisath, ruler of the dragonspawn armies of Nefarian. Perhaps you have heard of him?<br />
<br />
Return with his blood, &lt;Race&gt;, and I shall enchant the fragment into something that will grant you access to Onyxia's lair.<br />
<br />
You must retrieve the Blood of the Black Dragon Champion from General Drakkisath. Drakkisath can be found in his throne room behind the Halls of Ascension in Blackrock Spire.<br />
<br />
http://worldofwarcraft.gameamp.com/game_map/game_map/81.php<br />
<br />
Take a raid group of up to 15 to Upper Blackrock Spire and slay General Drakkisath.  Get his blood and return to Haleh in Winterspring.  The General is located at #1 on the above linked map.  He is flanked by 2 level 60ish Elite Black Dragonkin guards.  There's alot of debate about the best way to kill him.  Some like to fear the adds, some have druid chain sleep them.  I find that the safest way to do the fight is to have 3 tanks and 4 healers.  Each tank take either a guard or the general.  One healer for each guard tank and 2 for the generals.  Slay the Guards first then focus all power on the General.<br />
<br />
Return to Haleh in Winterspring and recieve Drakefire Amulet (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=16309) Your key to Onyxia's lair.<br />
<br />
Some notes on this quest series:<br />
<br />
 Everyone wishing to participate in an Onyxia Raid will need to have their own key to enter the lair<br />
 A Druid can solo the series up until Quest 7 which is the first BRD quest.<br />
 The BRD quests are single group quests they can be knocked out with a single group and instance but you will need to leave at one point to speak to Marshal Maxwell.  And you will need to reclear the first room and the jail cells prior to the last escort<br />
 I've heard differing reports regarding the Stormwind Raid quests.  Some state that you can stay back out of agro range and Bolvar will do the fighting.  Others state that Bolvar is not released from his charm until after the fight and you will have to kill the dragonkin guards (this information may have come from beta if anyone can clear this up let us know) Until there is confirmation here I would recommend taking at least a small raid just to be safe.<br />
 As a Druid you can prowl through the Dragonkin caves in Wintersprings to Haleh's rune.  If you have friends that all wish to do it together you will need to clear the cave.<br />
 Currently the General in UBRS drops 2-4 blood per raid.  You may need to repeat this fight many times so that you and your friends/guild can all get blood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question; Yes, you can solo the Bolvar part in SW.  Stay back from the doorway in that room and he will do the fighting.  I did this myself just the other day.  <br />
<br />
I kinda wish they would change it, would make the quest 'feel' more epic... lol, now that I am done :D</div></div><hr />

Just stand back.  More guards will keep coming to replace the dead ones.  Stay back, the AoE of the dragons is wicked and will take your health down quick.  I tossed in moonfires and fairrie fires after the half way point just to speed things up, but didn't do anything besides that.  I also let the random mage also doing the quest die after she AoE'd the entire group at the begining of the fight after I had warned her not to.  This quest takes Forever, be patient and do it right the first time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rillo</div><div class="date">08-17-2006, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things:<br />
<br />
During the jailbreak part of the quest, you must not only clear out the &quot;ring&quot; of jail cells of mobs, but you MUST ABSOLUTELY MUST clear out the storage room.  There are about 4-5 mobs in that room, but when you open it with Windsor, another 3-4 mobs come out.  This always results in a wipe if you don't open the storage room and clear it before returning with Windsor.<br />
<br />
There is also a way for non-stealthed toons to get to the Girl in Winterspring w/out teleporting.  You can actually jump to where she is above the caves without agroing anything.  A detailed progression on this is on thottbot.<br />
<br />
Yes, the last portion before travelling to UBRS is soloable.  Also, an added addition is that the lowbies hanging out in that room almost always join in the fight and get one shotted by an AOE.  I laughed about this, finished the quest and went afk.  When I came back I was dead because someone else had triggered the quest and I was a casualty :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikerun</div><div class="date">08-17-2006, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did everything until UBRS and it went smoothly. After Jailbreak, I went to SW with another guy from the PUG that did Jailbreak but Windsor bugged during The Great Masquerade and we failed the quest. Went backthe next morning when no one was on and I soloed it easily even though I died after one of the guards appeared over me.<br />
<br />
A priest that also died simply for being there kindly rezzed me after he ran back. I preferred to watch the fight and not release.<br />

<br />
We cleared the hexagonal room, then the ring of jail cells, cleared the Supply Room, then started the quest.  Safely escorted Marshal to the Supply Room, so he got his buff armor.<br />
<br />
But when we got into the Ring of Law area, there were too many pulls.<br />
<br />
If we had cleared the Ring of Law before clearing the rest, would they all respawn by the time we got back there?</div></div><hr />

I am unsure how much time you have, but this is way I have done it 4 or 5 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as we entered the instance, we cleared the hexagonal area, killed the doggie patrols, cleared the ring of law, killed Roccor, cleared the Supply Room, and the west side of the ring of jail cells.<br />
<br />
Took down the mini-boss that drops the Prison key (optional if you already have the key), then opened Marshal Windsor's cell.<br />
<br />
Ambushed twice, once when I rescued the prisoner, and once when I opened the Supply Room.  Marshal picked up his uber gear, and gave us a group buff (60% increased attack speed, I think).  You have to stay close to Marshal to benefit from this buff.<br />
<br />
Then it was time to rock, around the ring of law.  Marshal would go to different cells, and various elites would come out to fight us.<br />
<br />
Finally, a dash from the ring of law to the instance portal.  We wiped a couple of times (paladin who wouldn't heal himself, grr), but we got 'er done.  Estimated time: 2.5 hours</div></div><hr />
