Does anyone know if the Casino in SH still works. How often do you get a Gold Ticket as a reward? I see in alla.com that you could get a &quot;Scimitar of the Mistwalker&quot; as a reward. I never see one for sale in the bazaar.<br />
Have any of you played the Casino recently?<br />
Any tips?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've heard of people getting a ticket after 20k, and others spending 500k and still not seeing one.  Love that RNG :)</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine got every gold ticket item a monk can win for 500k.  Yeah, go go rng.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also dont forget the gold ticket has a number of different items as rewards, which one you get is completely random, unless your lucky enough to already own every other prize.<br />
<br />
If you can find a scimi for sale it will probably cost a lot less than winning one.</div></div><hr />

The only two that aren't in my experience are the DE mask and the Glowing Drum.  If you know a friend who has the droppable items, borrow them, and since they're not lore, the game mechanics can't give you the same item so it shifts to one of the next that you have/don't have.  So if you grabbed all but the Scim from a friend(s), you'd have a 1 in 3 shot of getting what you want.</div></div><hr />

they are lors except for the mounts, but it will not give you  either of the mounts if you have one on you.</div></div><hr />

I bought 3 a couple days ago from a person who won them all within an hour and with less than 50k spent. It is COMPLETELY random.<br />
<br />
My rewards in the order I got them: Holgresh Elder beads, Rubicite breastplate, Holgresh Elder Beads, and Guise of the Deceiver.<br />
<br />
My tips: Dont play, unless you have a huge bankroll to blow.<br />
If you arent winning back some coins, switch dealers.<br />

I only stopped to go to bed. Geez I used to have a gambling problem in real life....it came out tonight in the SH Casino. I am hooked. At least it's cheaper than folks pumping real currency into online poker. <br />
Everytime my 20 tokens ran out, i would say one more time and buy another 20. This is a total rush!!!! <br />
***Any math druids out there who know what the true &quot;odds&quot; are for getting a gold ticket? Is it 1 in 3,000 or something?<br />
&lt;Sorry for double post&gt;</div></div><hr />

Also, how do I set up the autoinventory? I recall using that only when doing tradeskills and forage. How do I set it up for this, and what is &quot;spamming trade&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you can actually set up a hotkey, /autoinv ?, but i just use the little box in my UI</div></div><hr />
