I'll probably be taking Trixtaa to 70 and play and alt if I don't get involved in raiding. Join the rush to 70~</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I'm gonna head off to go lvl to 70. Then probably start the farming for my 5,000g Artisan Flying Mount. I'm completely gonna not buy the 1,000g Regular Flying Mount, since we have flight form =D. And besides, it's only 40% quicker.</div></div><hr />

Supposedly, that is. It might have been an old post I was reading, for all I know, but it was made by a blue. So...</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;hr&gt;Q u o t e:<br />
    The current flight form speed of 60% makes it so slow that the moment a druid gets a flying mount they won't ever use flight form again. Why you ask? Because the ability can't help you to escape combat or be used for any other useful thing save jumping off cliffs once you're 70 and have a flying mount. Just take it out of the game if it's going to play that way! Don't taunt us with something that will be useless 2 months into the expansion after we have our real flying mounts...<br />
&lt;hr&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The current flight form speed is the same as general flying mount speeds. Why exactly would you buy a flying mount in this case? http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=32203250&amp;sid=1</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, you have to train up all the skills to get the epic flying mount (just like with a tradeskill, where you can't skip one of the skill levels), so buying a normal flying mount wouldn't be much more expensive than not.<br />

This must have changed.  I keep up with my buddies on their flying mounts with no problem.  AFAIK all flying mounts are 60% speed.  And we get 225 riding skill for free.  Buying a flying mount is pointless, though not that costly (I think only like 90g), if it's like regular mounts.  The training (for epic ground mounts) is the expensive part, the mounts themselves are cheap</div></div><hr />

I'll edit my post.</div></div><hr />
