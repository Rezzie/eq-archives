<br />
Should I get them, or is it not worth being unable to move the mob once rooted.<br />
<br />
I would really like to be able to complete all AAs but I am really scared of getting them without knowing exactly how it is going to effect my gameplay, since we can never take spent aa back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-03-2003, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say get it.  Once in a while it's useful to be able to root something and nuke it down quickly.  It does seem to prevent mobs' lifetaps from breaking their roots most of the time too. <br />
<br />
How often do you actually want to break root?</div></div><hr />

It really is a shame there is no way to turn AAs off, since there are situations where the AA helps and situations where it hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From the stand point of using it for crowd control.  I see very little difference.  Mem annul magic and tell people your going to annul to break root.  We use that on high end rootable mobs as it is with other classes.<br />
<br />
Doing damage would result in people getting summoned and gibbed.<br />
<br />
So basically, you gain the ability to root and burn mobs to the ground with your friends.  And have to use a spell slot for annul/dispell if your doing CC.  Which is awesome as it generates less AGGRO than the smallest nukes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also remember that any root spell will overwrite another.  You could load a level 5 root (lasts up to 8 ticks), which also has no resist modifier, so it's more likely to break quickly, though it's also more likely to be resisted outright.  You could use earthen roots to cut the root time down from 4.5 minutes to 1 minute, and still have the -30 resist check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't get it. I depend on the fact that I can break root with a nuke.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh...<br />
Well, that makes sense.  That situation has happened very rarely for me, but maybe it's common in the elementals?  I imagine a large portion of the people considering whether to get that AA are elemental enabled, and I'm an exception. :) <br />
If that's the case, then ignore me, listen to what these other people have to say, heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then root the wanderer, too.<br />
<br />
Get the root AA.  All my wizard friends are so jealous when they duo with me because my roots last and last and last.   Seriously, I have never regretted getting this AA, and like Quick Evac, is one of our more underrated AAs in terms of usefulness.  It also helps in raids when I get summoned, if the raid mob is rootable.  Just root and back away...it usually lasts long enough to lose aggro by the time it breaks.<br />
<br />
If you are using root for CC, simply use the long duration root for primary control, then overwrite the mob you want to &quot;release&quot; with the one-minute root.  What do you do while waiting for the one-minute root to release?  Debuff the mob, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AmonraSet</div><div class="date">09-04-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, its not an AA I can get but it seems to me that whether it is useful to you or not depends on how you usually use root spells.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself wishing that your roots lasted longer when a mob gets nuked then the AA’s would seem useful.  On the other hand if you wish that it was easier to break your root by nuking then it would definitely be a bad idea.<br />
<br />
There really should be a toggle to turn the AA on or off because it’s the only automatic AA I can think of which can actually be detrimental at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eyeds</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 01:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reasons I break root<br />
<br />
I use root to CC fast and dirty. sometimes I park em in a bad spot snare etc then move to a good spot.<br />
<br />
Pulling indoors. ok this sounds weird but...  I sometimes pull by rooting one mob then rooting any other adds so I end up with 1 in camp.  Then I go back and break root 1 at a time so chanter can mez easy like, normally do this with 2 or 3 mobs works good but if mob is rooted near a roamer you have to be able to move it, burst of fire breaks roots great and no chance of the mob summoning<br />
<br />
And last but definitly not least<br />
<br />
When charming I use root to hold my pet still for debuffs, malo snare tash etc, back up to the right range burst of fire till root breaks and charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For charming, the hardest part of the recharming process is the charm cast itself.  8 second cast time on our charm can be rough, even with spell haste.  I generally use a 1 minute root and just let my pet be rooted for the 30-40 extra seconds after charm lands.<br />
<br />
For using root to pull, I again use the 1 minute root shortly before I want the next mob.  (This is one of the benefits of having clicky savage roots--I only need to set aside one spell gem for earthen roots, yet I have access to both.)<br />
<br />
When root parking, if I put a mob in a bad spot...well, I deal with it. :)   I guess it would be nice to be able to move it, but I try not to park something in a bad spot to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Opivvy</div><div class="date">09-05-2003, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When charming I just use savage roots and leave my pet parked in one spot and just bring the mobs to him, much easier that way and if you wait to charm your pet when you get back from a pull he'll have full health.  I thought it might be bad at first, but when I thought about it, theres not really many times I want my root to break.  I don't regret training it, even though I originally only trained it cause it was the least points to get elder title :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
