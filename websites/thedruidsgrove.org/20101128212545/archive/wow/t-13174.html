I guess I could get a PvP head piece since the one in hVH never drops for me.</div></div><hr />

Certainly better than the one I currently have.<br />
<br />
That said, I'll probably save up to buy my T7 pieces.  We are very slow to progress, so having those pieces in advance will certainly help when we do start running the tougher raids.</div></div><hr />

In full Savage gear I sit at about 550 resil.  Any one in PvE gear in arena just crits away with little impunity.  I have found PvP is actually easier in PvE gear right now.  Don't try to out live the damage anymore, just try to out damage incoming damage.  Works ok in arena, but I am not a big BG guy, so I would assume PVP gear still holds up there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i need to look out for it !<br />

i'm currently using.....hmmm i think the Betrayer's Choker ?</div></div><hr />

if u mean the tortas oversized choker, maybe it was considered pre-armorchanges.<br />
but now the chained military godget is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

but now the chained military godget is the way to go.Yeah, that's the one.  But you are right it is no longer so nice.  Hmm...<br />
<br />
I was gonna save for the T7 gloves, maybe I'll get this neck instead.  I'll have to see which one is more of an upgrade that what I have today...</div></div><hr />

Winner. And the Titanium Earthguard Ring. Save your badges for your T7 gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">01-23-2009, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I figured out why I had the choaker so high on my list.  I had a type-o in my stat values!  I gave bonus armor a value of &quot;2&quot; when it should have been &quot;0.5&quot;.  That will do it.<br />
<br />
From what I can see even the newly nerf'd Handwraps of Preserved History are &quot;better&quot; than the T7.10 gloves.<br />
<br />
The T7.10 gloves have +24 armor, +23 agi, -5 sta and -38 exp.  That later is where the Handwraps really shine.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'll get the neck piece with my badges...</div></div><hr />

<br />
is the neck that good ?  better go re check its stats.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-24-2009, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah its quite nice.<br />
<br />
however i remember thinking i was not convinced that for the cost (300g + per Dragon's Eye) it was worth an upgrade over my Betrayer's Choker, 24str, 49stam, Yellow socket, +17 def and +19hit (which i am so short on!)<br />
<br />
and ofc what tipped me against it was its 350 armour and the soon to be - and now with us armour change/nerf patch !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">01-26-2009, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, the TEC is the best pre-raid neck for tanking, even with the armor change.  4 Dragon Eyes is a lot.  Fortunately, I had a level 70/375 JC mage alt, and the time commitment to get those tokens is about 10 minutes per day, so I just farmed them up myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-26-2009, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bought 2 dragon's eyes.<br />
<br />
keeping an eye out for 2 more for the TEC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">01-26-2009, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DE were 375g on my server the other night (though there was a 4 stack for 1100g).  But I wasted so much money on my healing kit I only have 1200g and wasn't about to waste it on a neck when the badge neck is &quot;free&quot;.  One thing I will say about LK is how little money I have coming in compared to BC.  Though I think that has to do with my lame decision to pick up inscription.  I have absolutely nothing to sell on the AH except for a stack or two of cloth.  I was far better off with mining and herbalism.<br />
<br />
I'm sure inscription has easily cost me 8000g to date.  And I don't even have it max'd out.</div></div><hr />

Then make cards (Noble's Deck) and sell them off.  Not great money, but it can be profitable.  JC / Mining still brings home the bacon.</div></div><hr />

Then make cards (Noble's Deck) and sell them off.  Not great money, but it can be profitable.  JC / Mining still brings home the bacon.I have herbalism, but the amount of flowers it takes to make a single card is insane.  I bought 100 lvl 80 flowers off the AH, I still did not have enough inks to make a single card.  And you don't control which card, or even deck, you make.  Neither of the two I have made are from the Noble deck.<br />
<br />
How many &quot;blue&quot; gems can you get from 5 stacks of ore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-26-2009, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5 stacks of ore (Saronite) ~4-6 rare gems in my experience +/- 1 rare per stack is normal.<br />
<br />
Cobalt = never had a rare proc, but stopped prospecting it after about 10 stacks because it's selling for insane amounts in ore form!  45-50g a stack on my server atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i saw the deck for sale on my server last week for 14,500g !!</div></div><hr />
