  Yet another 'rate this build' post, yay!  I'm still levelling my druid as Feral, but I'm planning to respec to some sort of Resto at 70.  <br />
<br />
Here's my toon, if that matters (still feral)<br />

<br />
but this is the 20/0/41 spec I'm thinking about:<br />

<br />
Would you please rate it's effectiveness for how it would fair in:<br />
<br />
1) Solo grinding quests, especially SSO dailies. I'm happy to carry around an extra set for DPS grinding, but I'm not going to spend any honor or badges on it.<br />
<br />
2) Instance healing in regulars and Heroics.  A little concerned about enough mana due to lack of Spirit on BG gear.<br />
<br />
3) Battlegrounds: I know almost nothing about BGs, I've seen other builds with Feral Charge in it but I understand it really hurts my ability to do solo grinding.  So I'm mostly just looking for a compromise that isn't going to hurt me too much there.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and consideration!</div></div><hr />

All the points in Balance will help with questing, but you might want to consider putting all three points in to Living Spirit.  Also, all five points in Subtlety is helpful in instances and raids.<br />
Something like this: <br />

I have guildies ask me to run daily's with them every night im on, but if that isn't the case for you definitely the few in balance will make all the difference in the world.</div></div><hr />
