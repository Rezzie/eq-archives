I have caught the pvp bug using my mage and hunter and love it.<br />
<br />
So I take my druid in to the bgs and to be honest I am pretty damn bad at pvping with him. I also end up healing quit a bit. So I am thinking going resto, the only problem is I pretty much sold my healing set and need new gear. But the ah is pretty bad 4 leather healing gear. Is it cool to use cloth, as there seems to be a bit more on the ah.<br />
<br />
And should i look 4 stam/intel/spir?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

I'd remain your normal spec and assist with crowd control, throughing a few heals here and there.<br />
<br />
Selling your healing gear was a bad move, imo. But not to freight as you can do a different instant runs to regain some key peices. Mech, Bot and Arc all have some druid healing pieces you can get; boots/main hand in Mech, belt/offhand in Arc and shoulders/helm in Bot. I'm sure there's more, I just can't think of them off hand.<br />
<br />
Look for Moonglade gear, that's our blue set in BC for healing.</div></div><hr />

Shifting out to heal yourself and fellow teammates I think makes you feel more of a complete druid but if you find you enjoy healing a friend or random and having them obliterate everything for you, spec resto.<br />
<br />
As for gear, just run a few instances whilst being feral still and just note to your group ahead of time that you are respeccing resto soon and gather some gear that way (or if the groups healer doesn't need it)</div></div><hr />
