<br />
In fact, to ensure she's given a spot (to make up for not bringing my Tree of Life to the raid) I've even dual-specced her for CoH healz - which btw, I rather enjoy.  <br />
<br />
HOWEVER....<br />
<br />
her heart's true desire is Shadow DpS.  So, I ask:<br />
<br />
any of you have an uber sPriest I can inspect?  I've made her Ebonweave set and I think she's at about an 11% hit rating, so now I've got to figure out what to work on next.  <br />
<br />
What gems do you typically go for? + Spell Crit?  + SP? <br />
<br />
(I hope I've put this thread in the right section......)</div></div><hr />

<br />
He averages 3.5-4k DPS, although we make him heal a lot in Ulduar.  (we 2 heal with him as a third when needed)<br />
<br />
I have cut lots of gems for him, and to the best of my knowledge they were all +19 spellpower!  Although I think he's a JC, so I may only be cutting the one's he doesn't have the rep for.<br />

<br />
my main guildie who usually DK tanks always used to heal on his priest. with wrath and dk's he went off the priest and has only very recently got her to 80 as shadow.<br />
<br />
he is now coming to heroics on his shadowpriest and is asking the same sorta stuff as he is disappointed in his dps and does not know the best ways to address it....<br />
<br />
i'm not expert on spriest but we had a chat about +hit to get him to the right level of hit for the bosses we face.<br />
<br />
I could only tell him that for an oomkinthe usual priority would be : spellpower&gt;haste&gt;crit<br />
<br />
not sure if this works for a spriest (and other casters?)<br />
<br />
gems wise I said go for spellpower unless the socket bonus is really good. <br />
<br />
so i'll be interested to see words of wisdom here to Mag so I can help him out :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowynne</div><div class="date">06-03-2009, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since patch 3.1 and Ulduar i ve changed my main feraldruid back to my first toon and beloved spriest :dance: <br />
Stats to look at for an entry ulduar spriest are :<br />
1st hitcap 289 (with misery)<br />
2nd spellpower pref above 1800<br />
3th crit pref above 15%<br />
4th haste around 270 to fit in 2 MF inbetween MB<br />
<br />
Most important is the rotation :<br />
VT, DP, MB, 2 tics MF (for 5 stacks of shadowweaving), SwP, then refresh dots when needed, MB when off CD and MF to fill gaps between MB.<br />
you should be able to dish out around 3.5 dps in a full raid environment (fully buffed in 25 men).<br />
gem for hitcap and use for the rest of your slots +19 sp.<br />
best meta gem imo 25sp and 2% reduced threat.<br />
<br />
If you want to check my current armory you can :<br />
Akhiro on Bronzebeard server.<br />
good luck on an awesome toon :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got a long way to go before I can even approach Ulduar.....but a girl can dream.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
At least I know what needs improvement and how to get it.  Thank you again.<br />
<br />
And out of curiousity - again for those of you with the knowledge and experience - why is everyone telling me to go Disc. healing?  What's wrong with good 'ol fashioned Holy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowynne</div><div class="date">06-04-2009, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are very welcome, if you need more info, just ask away.<br />
About disc ... tbh i haven't got a clue, we also have now more disc priests then holy ones :confused: <br />
1 thing i know is that a disc priest gives a 3% damage reduction to the raid, which is quite a lot when there is serious AOE damage doing on :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">06-04-2009, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eow - would the stat priority for a spriest be same as for an oomkin ?<br />
<br />
ie hit &gt;spellpower &gt; haste &gt; crit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">06-04-2009, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And out of curiousity - again for those of you with the knowledge and experience - why is everyone telling me to go Disc. healing?  What's wrong with good 'ol fashioned Holy?<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with good ol' holy!!!!  The advantage to disc, is that most raids can x2/x5 heal raids (10/25 man) by stacking AoE healers.  So when they need a little extra help (from the shadow priest), its typically best to have a strong single target healer to help keep the tank up, or provide additional mitigation talents rather than just more AoE.<br />
<br />
A good example of this is on the Thorim fight, we need our shadow to help me in the arena, while our resto shammy takes the other half through the tunnel.  I can easily pickup the splash damage in the arena solo, but need a little extra help if the tank loses aggro, or is slow to pickup an incoming ad, or the DPS just over bursts early.  I am sure it can be done with single healer, but shields etc, are really helpful.</div></div><hr />

The haste cap of roughly 270 is enough, any more would be a waste since you'll only need to just fill up the cd of MB with 2 MF, a lot more haste and you'll find yourself clipping off MF cos MB is already off cd before MF ends.<br />
Since our dot's can crit now too, i sincerely think that crit is the better stat to aim for after hitcap is reached.<br />
so for raiding spriest : hit&gt;spellpower&gt;crit&gt;haste<br />
for non raiding spriest (only instancing normal-heroics) : spellpower&gt;crit&gt;haste&gt;hit</div></div><hr />
