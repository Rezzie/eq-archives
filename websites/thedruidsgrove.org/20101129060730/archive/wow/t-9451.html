<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silvernight</div><div class="date">10-12-2005, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any tips on dueling in moonkin form?  So far I'm having quite a bit of trouble and not really benefitting from the form against most players.  I'm something like 33-13-5 at the moment, with moonkin, feral charge, and furor.<br />
<br />
Rogues are the exception, and can be nuked down fairly easily.  Fairy Fire, Moonfire, root, wrath. Drink.<br />
<br />
Warriors are tricky.  If I can get them rooted a few times, then I'm fine as long as I get a root+heal off before an execute.  Mortal strike isn't fun, but can be dealt with and with close to 9k armor and 6k mana I can outlast their hp.  <br />
<br />
Pallies have been owning me.  I just run out of mana and find myself going back to bear/heal tanking against them.  No reason to get into moonkin against them because they can cleanse roots.  In bear at least they can't cleanse bash.  Against them my balance build is only good for a few higher powered moonfires?<br />
<br />
Priests.  Mana drain = back to bear form, I expect.  I've not dueled a priest yet, but I think mana burn'll work on the owlbeast.  Bash+heal, back to bear.  Get feared, charge back to priest. Repeat til priest OOM.  In other words, no Moonkin form. <br />
<br />
Hunters.  Again, only faught one, but got pwned.  Drained mana and even with root was able to keep away from me enough.   Pet was a non-issue since I hibernated it.  Redueled him and went back to bear form and won.  I think moonkin is useless against hunters.  I'd rather be able to charge them and bash.<br />
<br />
Warlocks.  Not dueled them yet, but not being able to decurse in moonkin = hard fight, I expect.<br />
<br />
Mages.  GG.  No reason to be in moonkin at all, since you HAVE to heal against them.  Bear + caster ftw.  And not having NS means I can get 2 or 3 shotted with good crits.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I guess the moral of the story is that it's just another tool in the box and can't be the form you stay in if you want to win, but I'm having a hard time making my balance talents work for me in duels.  Group pvp is a completely different story.  The one big ruckus I was in I just /moonkin'd and walked into the middle of the melee and started moonfire/wrathing everything I could see.  Lived a looooong time, til my priest went down.<br />
<br />
Any advice?</div></div><hr />

Feral druids are of two kinds: either those with or without NS.  Those with NS are all but unbeatable, and those without are equally hard (cause they just bash or sprint away).<br />
<br />
I'm getting better against them, tho.  With rank1 root I can make them burn a lot of mana shifting back out, and by spending some time in bear I can get a free heal from regen.  Also, once I learned to root + bandage, I stopped having so many mana problems.<br />
<br />
Basically, I'm loving moonkin in pve, and it's ok in group pvp, but 1v1 it really, really needs a way to stun or interrupt.</div></div><hr />

Group PvP Moonkins thrive more.  A Druid in Moonkin giving his Mages, Warlocks, Priests increase crit chances to their spells sounds like a sound plan in group PvP.  At the same time the Druid is less of a target due to the increased armor.  So you can safely Nuke from the background with AoE and single target spells.  <br />
<br />
Even so though, a Caster Druid brings just as much to the table outside of Moonkin, the Caster's lose their 3% crit but now they have another potential healer.  To keep them up.  On the downside though, you become a Prime target now you've become a squishy.  It seems like a Draw when you loot at the two comparatively.</div></div><hr />

Besides, Leader of the Pack is more important.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'm old school, but you just have to face fact that like it or not you're a healer. If you &quot;refused to be a healer&quot; anywhere near me, I'd simply kick you from my group and most people I know would too.<br />
<br />
You don't tank as well as a Warrior, you don't dps as well as Rogue, Hunter, Mage, Warlock, Warrior, Shaman or even Priest.<br />
<br />
I'm Feral spec at the moment, but I'm not silly enough to think that in many situations my healing does far more damage than my forms. Paired with a Fury Warrior we're simply devastating...if he's alive...<br />
<br />
A closed minded Druid is only half a Druid, if that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Shaman with Windfury totem, a Hunter with Trueshot Aura or even a Warrior with Battle Shout will produce more DPS from 4 Rogues than a Druid with Leader of the Pack.<br />
<br />
Its nice as an option, but it doesn't justify the spot, particularly since a Druid can't perform its alternative functions (read: healing, crowd control)  in cat or bear form while the above mentioned classes can.</div></div><hr />

Go with feral man, it's fun being a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">10-19-2005, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People seem to forget that Druids learn their Healing spells naturally.  Not through any talents.  I heal just fine in MC even though I am feral.  Infact, I have MORE mana than my Restoriation counter parks due to Heart of the Wild.  And to be honest, up Nature's Swiftness Restoration makes a difference.  Anything after is purely filler and provides a mininal boost to your overall capabilities until you get Innervate.  Which people don't like us using on ANYONE but the damn priests. I'm glad I dropped, and my groups nor have my guild complained about it yet.  Besides, healing rotations makes better use of mana than waiting on Innervate.<br />
<br />
As long as the Druids knows when they should be healing and do that they are fine, and are usually allowed to use Feral forms in the groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can pull with a low rank moonfire or wrath, then I can tank them and heal MYSELF when I am low.  That leaves my other 2 guys to pull something else or just work with each other.<br />
<br />
I recently did Thistlefur cave with a rogue and a priest pulling 2-3x at a time... in 30 minutes, with the escort quest. (A mage joined for escort at the time.)</div></div><hr />
