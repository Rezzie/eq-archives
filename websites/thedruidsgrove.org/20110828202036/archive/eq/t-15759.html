<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">04-10-2007, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since Skin to Vines now turns undead and summoned creatures into plants and stops other abilities from working, it seems the cure was more harmful than the affliction.  With some new functionality we received a few days ago I was able to change Skin to Vines such that it works on everything except undead and summoned creatures.  This should go live in our next major patch.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!<br />

Of course, I assume that it still does not work to improve slashing attacks, as I assume that was dropped.<br />
<br />
Since I think it only improves fire damage, has anyone parsed it to see what benefit it does do?<br />
<br />
Yet another spell slot taken up with something that offers very, very minor benefits?</div></div><hr />
