As a general rule I go for str over agi.</div></div><hr />

1 point str gives you 2,5 AP (in cat form) / 2 AP (in bear form)<br />
1 point agi gives you 1 AP (in cat form), 0,04% crit, 0,066% dodge and some armor.<br />
<br />
Basically you should go for both. At the beginning focus on str, until you have around 2,5-2,6k AP. Then it is better to go for agi primarily.</div></div><hr />

One important thing to note about this graph is that +weapon damage is not included in the attack power display. You will have to convert +weapon damage to ap and add it manually.<br />
<br />
If all else is equal, threat-wise, it is better to have many small crits than fewer large ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">08-10-2007, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to think about that hardly anybody mentions in the agi/str discussion (which happens about once a week :)) is that when you have gear that is shared between bear and cat form, agi is more beneficial to bear form for the increase in dodge and armor. Most feral druids have different sets for each role, but when in cat form any good druid will be prepared to pop into bear form to OT a mob that gets loose. &quot;Bear&quot; in mind that you can't change your armor in combat, so having the extra agi on your DPS gear has that added benefit as well. It sucks to get two shotted in bear form because your DPS gear gimps your armor too much.</div></div><hr />
