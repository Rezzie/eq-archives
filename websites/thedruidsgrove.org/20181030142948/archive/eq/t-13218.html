<br />
Bad enough I ended up buying an expansion a year or so ago I didn't want at the time :\</div></div><hr />

I would like to see a checkbox or something to disable this screen. From what i recall from the past the screen will vanish a few days after the expansion went live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clakar</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had DON splash until DOD came out (or whatever the order), then I've had DOD splash there until, what two days ago or so and now it has been replaced with Ro.  They do not go away until you buy or find the &quot;hack&quot; in the INI file.<br />
<br />
I think this is just bad.  They should have a checkbox. No reason other then trickery to not have one.<br />
<br />
I am almost certain if you click buy, you &quot;BUY&quot; then and there, they bill your account, I feel it is very misleading and inappropriate as they place the &quot;buy&quot; button right under the &quot;accept&quot; button of the previous screens.  This is how I bought the unwanted expainson last time.  <br />
<br />
If you click twice / too quickly / around the same area, you'll hit both buttons in a flash and may not even realize it.<br />
<br />
EDIT, ok so i brain farted on that last bit, my &quot;habbit&quot; of click, click etc etc I should say, there are a few more screens / logon / then buy me Ro splash but it is BS none-the-less</div></div><hr />

You have the option to go into your billing and cancel it.  And while I don't know of a way to disable it directly, I have seen that when you click Yes to purchase it, and you get the next screen that says are you sure and you will be charged, if you click no I've seen it go away.  But it did on one account and not another.  I have 4 active accounts I play so will follow up on the others to validate.</div></div><hr />

I have not tryed this yet and can in no way take responsibility if it farks up your game.<br />
 <br />
NOTE: if you are changing your gamefiles like this, take my advice and save a copy of the origional file somewhere so you can copy it back in if the changes dont work.<br />
 <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
from Graffe's:<br />
 <br />
The file is eqlsPlayerData.ini and should be located in your EQ directory.<br />
 <br />
Look for these lines (the numbers will vary depending on when you last saw the popup):<br />
 <br />
ProphecyFirstOffer=1138712259<br />
ProphecyLastOffer=1138712259<br />
ProphecyViews=1<br />
 <br />
and change them to this:<br />
 <br />
ProphecyFirstOffer=9999999999<br />
ProphecyLastOffer=9999999999<br />
ProphecyViews=1<br />
 <br />
 <br />
(The numbers are a timestamp. The edit puts the whole thing so far into the future that you'll never be bugged again.)<br />
