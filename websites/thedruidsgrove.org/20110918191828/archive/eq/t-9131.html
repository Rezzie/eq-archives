<br />
Your last name angellove was found to be in violation of our naming<br />
policy. Because of this violation your last name was removed. Please<br />
file a petition in order to receive a new last name.<br />
<br />
<br />
Five years ago, in Sept of 1999, I did a /petition to get that surname, for a cleric, and was granted it. <br />
<br />
Two days ago, with no complaint from anyone, it was removed in a &quot;routine&quot; review of log files.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but angel is now listed in the name policy as a violation, and there is no more grandfather clauses for names from before the policy was changed<br />
<br />
but, I just did a brief glance through some /who and found at least 6 other angel names.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, my guild dies from frustration over the GoD bugs, Zum Muram has been ninja changed and bugged again, I cant get the X off a server transfer character in two years of petitioning, they cant transfer loot anymore that was accidently looted, yet they have time to do &quot;routine log reviews&quot; and whack characters names that are five years old and never had anyone complain about.<br />
<br />
Well I got it finally, I didnt believe it before, but SOE has no sense at all of customer service, they are more into control and cash than fun and gaming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and if they did a search for all names with Angel, why are there still at least 6 other people on my server with angel in their name?<br />
<br />
bah this is bull**** of the highest order.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellory</div><div class="date">08-16-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From SoE's naming policy<br />
<br />
3.  Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin, Angel, Devil, Demon). <br />
<br />
Now according to my old Guide book, Angel was not listed as of the begining of 2003 or so.  However, the names listed are merely examples.  Hence the e.g. part.  E.G. is latin for Exempli Gratia.  That is, a free example.  The list is not, and was never meant to be all inclusive.  I would assume Wicca would also be a bannable name.  As would Belzebub even though those names are not listed.<br />
<br />
In general there has never been a grandfather clause on names.  There has been a tradition that if a character manages to survive till level 51 with a surname that is not a catagory 1 or 2 offense, then they'll be allowed to keep it.  But that's never been a hard and fast rule.  It depends on the GM or sometimes Senior Guide who gets to make the call.<br />
<br />
With the ability to change names at will, either first by paying, or surnames with the new commands, I would assume that SoE no longer considers player reputation to be that big of a deal, so they've probably gotten a lot more harsh on removing naming violations. <br />
<br />
Also, I would assume that regardless of what their CS might have said, that it was probably not the result of a log search or a database match, but the result of a petition or a random guide/GM seeing you.  Had it been a database mining investigation, then all angels should have been removed.  The fact that this is obviously not the case would infer that you were picked specifically.<br />
<br />
In any event, I dont think you have any real chance at getting Angel in any form back.  While you have my sympathies, your name was in fact in violation of the naming policy.  At this point, about all you can do is put everyone else with the name angel through the same kind of annoyance that you yourself are now going through.  SoE will not give you back Angel, but you can force them to go off and remove angel from everyone else.  Like any nerf really.  <br />
<br />
But is that really what you want?  While its obvious your gaming experience has been ruined to an extent by this, is that a reason ot ruin others?  Personally I think its SoE's job to do that.  But, thats your decision.<br />
<br />
Also, as for guilds, they have always had different naming guidelines to a certain extent.  An example would be a guild named Qeynos Guardians.  No player could ever get that name because it uses an EQ name.  But a guild certainly could.  Guild names are more descriptors than names and have had much broader guidelines.</div></div><hr />

I did get the name restored, and another name fixed on my account.<br />

Sobe pull some strings?*laughs*  My guess is that Scirocco made SOE see the light.  A name is very personal to many players.  Iisbliss was so upset when this first happened she was going to quit the game.  Think of all the people with a form of &quot;angel in their names going through the same adjustment.  A lot of people are in a &quot;wait see&quot; status with OoW and I don't think SOE can really afford to make so many players angry over such a trivial issue at the moment.<br />

I saw Iisbliss' post, and used my mighty correspondent powers (!) to bring the situation to the attention of Brenlo, who is as reasonable as the next guy.   Other folks with some form of angel in their names also ran into this at the same time.   Brenlo said he'd look into  it.  Of course, as what goes on between a customer and SOE is confidential, I didn't know the result until Iisbliss posted here.</div></div><hr />

For instance I had a cat named Sylvestur for about 18 months after Luclin came out.  Then one day out of the blue I am told it violates the naming policy and must be changed  (Reasons are probally kind of obvious, but that is not the point).  2 weeks later I see a Sylvestur the cat running around the Nexus (like level 10).  I repeatedly petition, and finally I am told I need to stop petitioning, the name is not a violation of the naming policy (Hmm it was 2 weeks ago).  Repeated e-mails to the Server GM and notes to the developers corner were ignored. <br />
<br />
 I finally just gave up, it was just an alt I did not play very much, but it was incredibly frustrating .<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand...<br />
<br />
I know at least 12 months after the first person petitioned (And there have been many) Bodacious Tatas on TP, they were still running around with the name.  <br />
<br />
You either made enemies of someone who knew a GM (Yes it does happen :)), A friend of a GM wanted to be the only one with that last name or  some new GM is being ridiculously over zealous in the naming policy (This may happen from time to time, but is probally the most rare of the 3 options).  In the past you could replace GM (In this context) with a Senior Guide, but I do not believe they have this power any longer.</div></div><hr />

OK question for the legal minded out there:<br />
<br />
I know there HAS to be a law against editing a 'contract' after it is signed.   Otherwise I would just scribble on my car lease that clause ZZ-14: &quot;If you pay us on Tuseday, the car is your no matter how much you owe!&quot;<br />

So my question... with EULA.. If they are allowed to change it anytime they feel like it, does that give me legal power to &quot;get my money back&quot; etc.?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's way agreements typically contain the &quot;may change from time to time&quot; clause.  In this case, you accept any changes they put in every time you click the &quot;accept&quot; button.<br />
<br />
Credit cards work the same way.  They change the terms, you accept by using the card.<br />
<br />
I suppose that if they put in a change that you found unacceptable, you might be able to get back the current month's fee (most likely prorated.)  Could be fun filing the small claims court to test this out.<br />
<br />
Note I am not a lawyer, but I'm sure this is the way it works.<br />
