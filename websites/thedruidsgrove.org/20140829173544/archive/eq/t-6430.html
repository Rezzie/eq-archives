I quad over by the bridge to IC. A good safe spot is just to the south of the bridge.Pull Kodiaks, Cougars, Ry'Gorrs. Also single pull Griffins to this area. All these drop ring/shawl quest items that can be sold for good PP if you decide not to do these quests (HQ Kodiak pelts can sell for 1000pp each in the bazaar) Not to mention foraging tufts of dire wolf fur(50pp each in the bazaar). The exp is decent at 42 (starting to slow), yet I still need the some quest items, and the money I get trying to farm them makes it worth the time and effort.</div></div><hr />

Save those Tusks and do the quest in Cobalt Scar and maybe get lucky and get a blue diamond! :-)   You might even be able to do Spirocs at this level.  I know I started them at 44, but I would have tried at 42 if I'd known about them at this level.</div></div><hr />

Make your way over to the Spiroc village and mem up harmony. I quaded here from 39-45 IIRC, around 45 or 46 i moved to CS and started quading Wyverns til 54. It's been years but i'm pretty sure these spots remain golden.</div></div><hr />

After that, quadding otters and Wyverns in CS are good xp, the otters could actually take you to 60 if you dont get bored of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nuther</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did all of level 37, 38 and now I am finishing level 39 on the spectres. I have 200 wisdom, a few hundred more mana in items, Mana Pres II, fast cast, and extended range. I usually hunt with a clarity. When I started, a quad took a whole mana bar. Now I can finish with a blue and change left over. One clarity is enough time for at least 2 quads. XP at 37 was 2.5 blue per quad. Now at 38 and 39, xp is holding at 2 blue per quad. Money is solid.</div></div><hr />

I leveled there from 40 - 45 in a couple of days.<br />
Once you know the layout of the tree, pulling is easy, and the huge open area nearby makes quadding easy to do.<br />
Theres also practically zero chance of you getting any adds in this area; the only thing near by is an ogre village, which is easily avoided due to the quading areas size.</div></div><hr />
