 I know it will not happen but it would be funny if any horde that used the exploit or attempted to use it got banned.</div></div><hr />

I've seen it done at the stables and farm.  Even seen how to do it at the stables.<br />
<br />
It's been said it will be fixed.  I'm sure it requires a client patch, so don't expect it too soon unfortunately :(</div></div><hr />

It does seem to make for some quicker games however.</div></div><hr />

I have now seen Alliance doing it in AB also so please excuse me for claiming it to be a Horde only exploit, I was wrong.</div></div><hr />

In any case, from what I heard the exploit was used more by the horde because, in AV, the alliance flags have more terrain around them, so there are more places to hide.  The horde flags are more out in the open, so alliance players could not hide as well to use the exploit.<br />
<br />
I have to say that I'm happy I never ran into it.  I get really really annoyed when people do not play fair in battlegrounds.  It's a battle of skill between players... whats the point of playing if you need to cheat?</div></div><hr />
