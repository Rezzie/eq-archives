<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>WEDruidVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Didn't know where else to put this. I have my magelo setup, and would like advice where I might meed to update my equipment. Currently 48 Druid, tunare. I solo more then group...<br />
Here's me! (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1008365)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It goes here, in Druidic Equipment. =)<br />
<br />
I'd definitely look into getting some Elysian gear, especially the bp, soloable (tho perhaps a bit difficult at your level, you'll have to see) in Umbral Plains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tunarian Scout Armor is pretty decent as well  for Wrist and helm or BP.<br />
<br />
Get a Ornate Helm if you can they go pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
Work on epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radlore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can get a few nice pieces by soloing Disturbed Elysian Remains in Umbral Plains. You will probably need to get in the mid 50's first though otherwise you're gonna get alot of resists. They have about 20khp as well iirc but are root/snareable and don't summon (Theres a named version that does... corrupted I think). With your mana free dot and patience you can take them out as soon as you're high enough level to not get resisted all the time. I think I was lvl 59 cos I hadn't quite got pot9 when I did this - I found I had to med during kills for mana, so you might want to persuade someone to help - team up with another druid perhaps.<br />
<br />
In the mean time;<br />
<br />
A Platinum or Velium Jasper ring would upgrade your moonstone ring because +6/7 wis gives more than 30 mana at your level. These are player made and can be picked up fairly cheaply in the bazaar. <br />
<br />
But even better is a ring that drops on floor 5 in the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad, Velious - (Diamond Wedding Band (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3850) ). ToFS is a great zone to explore - you will need a key off a named on each floor to progress to the next floor, all of them use other mobs on the floor as place holders. The keys get added to your keyring so you can get back to you body if you die, although higher up corpse runs can be awkward. Each floor gets progressively harder so it's easy to find out if you can handle this. <br />
<br />
Another good ring is the shadel bandit ring which drops in fungus grove and coral ring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19273) from nadox. Actually nadox has some decent stuff for the effort and it's possible to solo there but again you might need some more levels, same for FG.<br />
<br />
Some nathsar gear drops off named in chardok, the vambraces (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6800) and wrist (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6804) are found not too far in but you may not be able to solo there just yet. Chardok is a fun place to charm fight with the chokodai's near zone in, although the gear won't be a huge upgrade/<br />
<br />
You can do this quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1217) if your giant faction is ok for some coldain skin boots (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4560) <br />
<br />
If you want an enduring breath item, a fairly easy one to solo for is this neck (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7557) gained from this quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1301). Ironically you need enduring breath to hunt the snakes for the quest pieces but you have a spell so no biggie)<br />
<br />
You may or may not consider these (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7159)  an upgrade as you would lose out on mana:/ You can fight coterie legionnaires in Maidens Eye for them.<br />
<br />
Here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2754)  is something in GoD you can solo for a nice neck (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26682) <br />
<br />
I see you have the earring of solstice, so I guess you already know about Xanthe's one.<br />
<br />
Tunarean Soldiers gear will upgrade some of your slots. It's player made by tailors but you may be able to get a reduced price by providing the hides yourself...<br />
<br />
Soon you may want to do some grouping in Plane of Innovation, there you can get Smoothmetal Torque (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16313), bellows crafted cap (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16314) and boiled leather cuirass (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16456)  but they're not quite soloable at your level.<br />
<br />
I found it hard to upgrade my ODS and Braclet of Sense without raiding at the time. ODS is a quality item. I'd recommend starting on parts of your epic if you haven't already, it's much more fun doing the easy bits at your level when you can still get xp for some of them.<br />
<br />
There is tons more - if you get really stuck one idea is to look at other peoples magelos who are similar level at eqrankings (http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Druid&amp;server=&amp;order=Level&amp;page=53) , then use Allakhazams (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/searchdb.html?iname=) to get specific item info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WEDruidVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, at EQRankings I checked Druids on ALL servers at different levels, sorted by mana and by hp. Here's where I currently stand along those other druids that are registered...&lt;BR&gt;<br />
Level 48 ranked by mana: 3rd highest out of 10. By HP: 4th highest of 10<br />
Level 49 by mana: 3rd of 14. By HP: 7th of 14<br />
Level 50 by mana: 5th of 20. By HP: 11th of 20<br />
<br />
So my level 48 Druid already has more mana then 11 of 14 lvl 49 druids and 15 of 20 lvl 50 druids. And HP wise I have better HP totals then half the 14 druids at 49 and about half of the 20 druids at 50.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
So that's not bad right now. Better then most, but I'm looking to upgrade anyway. Need a MP item, Ornate boots give MPIV I think, which is cheaper and should give the same mana savings as the BoFS/FT3, correct?&lt;BR&gt;<br />
Also looking to get my little butt over to Umbral. I have a thread for that discussion in the Quests forum if anyone wants to post advice on that...hear its dangerous to get through ME...hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nuther</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You may or may not know that you cant wear any Ornate until level 55 because you cant do the quest. <br />
<br />
Here is my magelo for some ideas. I am not too far ahead of you.<br />
