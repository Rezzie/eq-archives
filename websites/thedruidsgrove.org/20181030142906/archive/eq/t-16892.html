 <br />
I leveled to 82 in hills of shade (duo'd with a wizzy), mech guardian (group) and the loping planes gators (solo).<br />
 <br />
Looking for another solo spot like the gators in loping but havent found one yet.</div></div><hr />

Mob hp take a big jump in the new zones with the exception of animals.  Normally, that would be a good thing for druids, as we specialize against animals.  However, all animals are now marked &quot;weak&quot;.  This distinction means that they have lower hp, lower offensive output than normal mobs but are much more resistant to spells and designed for something melee can solo better than casters.</div></div><hr />

The days of Gator mass charm are not renewed in this new expansion so we are now forced to solo for XP the same way Wizzies and necros do (though do take my word on it that Kiting now isn't a BAD thing for druids).  I'd recommend picking your favorite SOD zone, scouting for an open area where you can kite, and have at it.  If the mobs around are bunched together you could always snare/evac the first few to break the camp or if you have the mana pool for it, snare all the mobs you pull and kill one at a time.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Really?  Because I used Glamour of Tunare and was still getting resists from the light blue animals in OGH with the new 81 charm.  I even tried using the Rk2 level 76 charm instead and got resists or breaks seconds after it landed.  I can't imagine trying to charm a mob anywhere near the level 83 limit of the spell.</div></div><hr />

Even the RK2 76 charm breaks more on the gators in LP. And I have 2 levels of the charm AA.</div></div><hr />

They nerfed something.  LP gators, bears, etc are breaking at least once every pull these days.  I tried the new 81 charm in LP and it breaks more then our old RK2 Charm from my perspective.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the point of using a weak mob to make an even weaker pet.  Over all spell resists are about what I normally see, usually resisting a root here and there or a fire based dot.  Only exception to this has been the infected animals but they are not considered weak. They do seem to have a higher resist rate than the other mobs in the zone.</div></div><hr />

Other mobs I can tank too, but have to root them and step back to let heals land fairly often.  Kills are quicker than kiting and use about the same amount of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ieglawen</div><div class="date">11-06-2008, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been charming Worgs in LP with good success. They are not camped at all on Povar server like the gators always are. If you follow the road to HOS and kite them on the right side of the road you avoid all of the orc roamers. Not only are there a huge supply of mobs but they rarely resist anything though charm does fail fairly often. <br />
I usually avoid leveling up until I have all of the AA's done for that level, so for instance at level 81 I will put AA's on about 90% and grind them out with LOTD each morning, by the time I ding 82 I've usually gotten all of the AA's done (120?) and need to level up to buy additional things. This expansion has a lot more new AA's so I'm doing 95% right now. As I gain levels the AA exp for each Worg is less, thats why I don't ding ding ding as fast as I can.<br />
One other thing I've written about before is creating a &quot;parking lot&quot; with your almost dead mobs that are below flee health. Once they turn around to flee I let them live and just re-snare them. Then I keep pulling mobs and charm kill them down to &lt;20% health (&lt;10% is prefered), let it flee, and resnare. Once I get 12-15 mobs all standing around almost dead, I pop LOTD and kill them all at once, which give about 3 AA's initally and I can pretty easily get 2-3 more AA's for the duration of the LOTD. Getting 6 AA's for 45 minutes of soloing is pretty impressive IMO.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you for me that at level 84 doing the Gators in LP is still the fastes exp I can find, solo or not solo. Espesially if you are burning your Lessons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oahu</div><div class="date">02-01-2009, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gator exp drops fairly dramatically when you hit 85.  I have been considering deleveling on sundays after raids, burning lesson each day and then using Expedient recovery on Friday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ieglawen</div><div class="date">08-06-2009, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I've gotten into the habit over the years to level up slowly after an expansion. I know certain raiding guilds often stress leveling up, but I can take several months to make the 5 levels.<br />
My reasoning is that since its easier to get aa's at lower levels I spend 90% of my xp doing aa's until I have them all maxed out for that level, then I ding and start working on the next ones. Plus I make sure I have 30 aa's before I actually ding the next level.<br />
I have messed with dinging with 30 aa's, spending them, then deleveling and earning 30 more, dinging, spending them and deleveling to earn 30 more etc. <br />
<br />
Of course if you raid a lot this isn't usually acceptable to a guild where they expect you to MGB our latest skin, but other than that take your time and you will spend less hours getting the latest and greatest aa's.</div></div><hr />
