There was this overly small barbarian I think? In the Karanas.  He said something amusing like &quot;would you like me to bounce you?&quot; and if you said yes he said a couple of other amusing lines killed you.  Can anyone find?<br />
<br />
I know it's true - I didn't believe it, so I tried it... the EXP penalty hurt...<br />
<br />
Edit: The NPC is called Vilnius the Small and stands around in one of the forests of West Karana.  Going to log a mule on and find him :p  <br />
<br />
Edit: Couldn't be bothered finding him, but found the quote instead<br />
<br />
Vilnius the Small says 'Soandso, just because I am short don't mean I can't bounce your Wood Elf rump all over these hills.  Now, do you have something for me, are you just in search of a rump bouncing?<br />
You say 'I am in search of a rump bouncing'<br />
Vilnius the Small says 'My pleasure to oblige you then. Shall I start on the left side or the right side?<br />
<br />
(He then starts quad-piercing for 156)</div></div><hr />

There used to be a ton of Easter eggs in the zone from talking to the different NPCs.  For instance, if you say, &quot;Verant sucks!&quot; the guards will respond, &quot;Then why are you here?&quot;  I believe some still are in the game, but unfortunately a ton of them got removed.<br />
<br />
I still think the thing that struck me the funniest was when I started my Beastlord.  Originally, you summoned a pet and cast a buff on it to make it to the appropriate level.  Very early on the pet would say, &quot;Ding!&quot; everytime you cast the buff on it.</div></div><hr />

(that's how it looked in December 2001)<br />
<br />
Lots of quotes there, including...<br />
&quot;Danger, Princess Jolina, Danger!&quot; (Lesser Faydark: Gearheart, when attacked)<br />
&quot;Yo yo yo, homies!  What'cha Want?  I got da patterns you need!&quot;  (North Ro: Spoolie Gee...did he ever say this?  I never could get him to...)<br />
&quot;Never fear...Smyth isss...Here!!&quot; (South Karana: a Putrid Skeleton)<br />
&quot;wHaT sEeK iT Is YoU FrOM LiTHiNiaTH?...Prince Thirneg of the Tunarean Court has amassed a vast supply of phat lewts!  Perhaps you should ask him for some!&quot; (Plane of Mischief: Lithiniath)<br />
&quot;Well I haven't figured out that part yet. I guess I'll slay a dragon, maybe save a princess or two.  You know the normal stuff. I don't want to get too crazy heheh, you know like calculate which weapon is the most efficient and debate over it in public forums to no end.&quot; (Thurgadin: Thermin Wandereye, in response to &quot;what quest&quot;)<br />
&quot;Too many towels. Oh well, someone told me they were good to have once.&quot; (Timorous Deep: Alrik Farsight)<br />
<br />
And some things that don't give an exact quote:<br />
&quot;Rivervale Deputies are right proud of their duds - in fact, if you complement them (&quot;Nice hat!&quot; or &quot;Nice mask!&quot;) they'll tell you just how proud!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Deputies aren't the only one's proud of their status. Marshall Anrey of Rivervale (upstairs above the bank) has a very strict attitude on how he is addressed. When you say, &quot;Hello Marshall Anrey&quot;, he barks that you should not be lazy, and address him with &quot;Hail,&quot; like all other deputies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a Dwarven lady standing at the end of the docks in Butcherblock, eagerly awaiting your love. If you tell her &quot;I love you,&quot; she responds favourably, saying how nice your names are together. If you ask her to marry you, she'll respond, &quot;Why yes I'll marry you ......, we'll make a fine couple.&quot; She's not very particular, however, as she has been seen professing her love for both men and women of every race. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the Mistmoore graveyard, you will find two marked semi-legible gravestones. One is for &quot;Hutch, was a good man, and a great warrior&quot; and the other for &quot;Brandon, was a great man and a [sic] excellent 3D artist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another famous graveyard is in the tutorial. You can find all sorts of people there, including Dyne the Diligent (Pour Homme), Mixxy the Bitter (death was always in her wake), Vashaar the All Seeing (his eyes are at last shut), Binelen the Pathweaver (we are as lost children without her), Aradune the Green (his flaming sword was a beacon to all), Ssra (snuffer of worlds), and Xectia the Tardy (even unto the grave).&quot;</div></div><hr />

I only remember a couple others, like...<br />
&quot;We already knew that!&quot; (in response to &quot;Aradune is stinky!&quot;)<br />
And umm, one that goes something like...<br />
&quot;I suggest you go do that to yourself.  If not, I hear they have specially trained rockhoppers in Shadow Haven.  Perhaps that would be more your speed?&quot;<br />
<br />
I remember there were at least 10 or so different things they would say, and someone posted them on my server's message board long ago...<br />

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;One of the most startling things in Everquest is when the mobs start talking... I know I nearly jumped out of my skin the first time I heard a beggar say, &quot;Might I have some coppers, please?&quot; Madmen in the desert also say this. There are a few other things that speak, as well - spectres whisper &quot;Diiiieeee&quot;, giants mutter in their own language... There's even rumoured to be some vocal traps in Velious!

Groflah Steadirt says 'Tumpy Tonics are great!!  I used to drink them often in a bar in Kaladim.  Kind of glad they don't serve it here.  I could not stop drinking them and they would cause me to constantly drain the dragon.  I get tired of running to the docks for that reason.'<br />
