<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-09-2009, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm making this thread for a source of information in case this ever happens to any of you guys... I never thought it would happen to me. <br />
<br />
So I logged in last night for the first time since getting my Elder achievement Thursday night/Friday morning and what do I find?<br />
<br />
My epic staff was replaced with some green piece of junk, ALL my PvE items that could be vendor'd were gone, all my mats were gone, and i only had about 300 G when I had ~5K when i logged out.<br />
<br />
I go to my bank, only to find similiar results: almost all mats stored in my bank were gone.<br />
<br />
that's when my GM told me that there were a couple of incharacteristic withdrawals of gold and mats from the guild bank made by me (I NEVER withdrawel money from the guild bank).<br />
<br />
The actions i've taken:<br />
<br />
immediately logged back out, changed my password, then logged back in and started a ticket. I waited ingame for a GM to respond (which never happened) until, being fed up, logged out, started an AVG and Malware scan on my laptop and went to bed.<br />
this morning, i looked at the scan results and my computer came up clean for keyloggers. I received am email from Blizzard saying that my issue has been escalated.<br />
After getting to work, I downloaded Spybot S&amp;D, and scanned my work computer. I couldn't see anything about keyloggers there either, but fixed whatever Spybot suggested. I'll go home tonight and run Spyware on my laptop, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Again, I want to make this a &quot;Source of Information&quot; thread. If this has ever happened to anyone else, maybe they would like to provide a suggestion for what to do next, and what I should expect as far as timeframe goes, and what the final outcome or resolution will be. Please don't respond to this thread with &quot;I'm sorry that happened, GL&quot; type posts in order to keep this thread nice and clean and streamlined. If you would like to express any condolences for my predicament, please send me a PM, they would be more than welcome.<br />
<br />
I will update as events unfold.</div></div><hr />

I have to say, that Blizzard was all over it once it was escalated. I heard nightmare stories last night from a guildy that had his account hacked, and his 3 70's transferred to 3 different servers, charging his credit card for each transfer, etc etc etc, and im grateful that i wasn't hit anywhere nearly as hard. There was no mention of me getting my gold back, so at this point, I'm just sitting here hoping...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">02-09-2009, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing I thought of -- and historically a big cause of account &quot;hacks&quot; even before all the keyloggers came along -- is sharing your account info.<br />
<br />
Does/did anyone else have your account information?  Even if they didn't knowingly share it with anyone, it's possible that there was a keylogger or malware on *their* PC, which captured your login info.  In which case, you might want to warn anyone who has your account info to do a malware scan (or warn anyone whose account you may have logged into recently).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-09-2009, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">another good question, and the answer would definitely be NO. I've never given anyone my password or account information. I'm definitely going to get the authenticator though... i don't want this to ever happen again. From what i read on Blizzard's site, they make no effort to restore any lost items the second time your account has been used without authorization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-10-2009, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this happened to a guild just before Wrath came out.<br />
<br />
we noticed a couple times 'he' came online and did not say anything, then logged and alt then a bank char etc but at the time we did not think anything of it :(<br />
<br />
when he came online to tell us we were all gutted.<br />
<br />
it took him a long long time and a lot of patience with Blizzard to get his items restored acorss 3 lvl 70's. he was phoning them regularly, seemed to get passed from one person to another at times. even got conflicting info from one blizzard person to the next.<br />
<br />
he had to continually state no one else ever had his password details, assure them he regularly ran virus checkers etc<br />
<br />
in the end he got most of his stuff back BUT no gold was restored.<br />
<br />
from memory it took well over a week b4 he was back up and playing properly. i'll have a chat to him tonite and pass on anything else of relevance skw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-11-2009, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks, kheldar. I received a Customer satisfaction survey today, which leads me to believe that Blizzard has completed their investigation. I'm going to start another ticket tonight when i get home, but I don't really see me getting anywhere with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-11-2009, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, we had a senior member of our guild hacked about a month ago, which resulted in huge losses to the guild bank as well as that toons coffers. <br />
<br />
It took almost a month for Blizzard to complete the investigation and restore the &quot;non-BOP&quot; items (obviously everything in guildbank) <br />
<br />
So be patient.  They are not quick, but they are pretty thurough.  I know its frustrating, but they will replace your stuff eventually.  Its tough if you were a regular raider though because its likely they won't replace your consumables/gold/BoE equipment, until the investigation is over.  (Tough to raid without money, gear or consumables)<br />
<br />
Ironically, that gentlemen is and always has been hard down on NO mods, because he was worried about hacks.  And of course he's the one that gets a key logger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-11-2009, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, raiding with no consumables and not enough gold to buy them pretty much sucks... i bummed a couple elixirs off of a guildy until some of my skinning mats sell.<br />
<br />
I tried to buy the Blizzard authenticator, but they're sold out until next week :(<br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out how i got hacked. I remember hearing about the security hole in Internet Explorer, but i thought that was taken care of...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-12-2009, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It happened to a friend of mine too.<br />
He went to bed and one hour later he came on.<br />
I tried to whisper him but no response.<br />
Tried again... still no response -&gt; very very weired.<br />
Phoned him -&gt; 2 mins later logged in -&gt; wtf some mats where gone -&gt; logged out -&gt; changed PW.<br />
This was a close one, cause not to much damage (maybe 500g mats).<br />
<br />
Another friend has it account hacked to, but had to wait 2 weeks to get all restored :-(</div></div><hr />

It makes hijacking your account much more difficult.  Downside is you need the token to log in, so if you lose it or don't have it with you, you won't be able to log in.  (Blizzard can take it back off your account, but you have to call them and provide additional info.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-12-2009, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just checked the blizzard store today, and it was available, so my order is now pending. I imagine i'll feel quite a bit better once i have more protection. I never thought this would happen to me, as i always considered myself a reasonably safe web user. This has been an eye-opener, to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-12-2009, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it is funny how I feel more worried about my wow account getting hacked than I worry about getting my machine getting hacked if I were browsing the Internet with an unpatched IE5.5 on Windows 98.<br />
