When someone first told me &quot;Did you hear Heath Ledger died?&quot; My first thought was not the actor Heath Ledger, someone else named Heath Ledger. It is saddening to me when young people with so much ahead of them and so much to offer end up this way. I know there have been many articles and news stories about Heath and his life. I liked this one  (http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3237974.ece)the best.<br />
 <br />
Heath will be missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He seemed to have a humility that others do not have.<br />
<br />
I have loved his work since Knights Tale and The Patriot.<br />
<br />
His new Joker role did bring up mental images of Brandon Lee in The Crow, sad coincidence, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

People die. Young people die of things all the time, tragic, self-inflicted, terrible accidents or horrible diseases. The only time most people take notice is if they're actors.  To me there's something sick about that in our culture where we obsess over these people.<br />
<br />
Man, I sound so much like my Mom just now. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyyr Lu'Storm</div><div class="date">01-29-2008, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never cared for James Dean.<br />
He only made like 3 movies, and I never thought any of them were all that great.<br />
And like Elvis Presley, I just never got him, either.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is a generational thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">01-29-2008, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heath Ledger always seemed to take and do role he wanted to do, it seems he was pretty passionate with his craft. Alot of fans of his appreciated that, it seemed very much if, he didn't dig the script or whatever he wasn't going to put off a pretty mediocre performance that alot of celebs get away with.<br />
Personally, I thought it was neat he did that romantic comedy 10 Things I Hate about You, partly, because that school he was filming at was a team I used to play interscholastic sports with.<br />
<br />
I hated that freaking field, astroturf, next to the Puget Sound, on cold days it was even worse because of the windchill for the heedy winds, not to mention it always rained. Had some silly footing that made planting and turning and all kinds of stuff and losing footing on. I kinda hated the hydroplaning effect making tackles and getting tackled on that field and sliding for 10 yards afterwards. Made for some nice turf burns, and abrasions that took till June to fully heal, from what happened in October.<br />
<br />
Pan is fairly spot on. I usually(I really can not explain it, just sort of happens) end up talking with alot of celebrities, musicians, athletes, cheerleaders, and that is one of the topics that usually comes up. Alot of them would love to just live their lives, as an entertainer or whatever, without being made a public spectacle, afterall, they are still human. Generally, they do not mind say, getting groceries or something typically done every day and getting a few fans saying hello, an autograph or picture.  But, when it is ridiculous with papparazzi all over the place snapping pictures doing things like doing their day to day routines, then, they start getting allittle pissed off.<br />
<br />
Who is this mystery man so and so was out with at a nice resteraunt, often, those are just her brother, his cousin,(been in enough of those myself, just after an event and taking someone to a bar for something to eat, drink, dancing, sometimes just showing them the way to where they want to go so they do not get lost, then, I get stalked for a week or so) someone pitching an idea for a music video or something like that.  So, often, people are generally looking for something allittle bit bigger than themselves, that and the celebrity watching junk is a 3.4 billion dollar industry.</div></div><hr />
