You get a shroud mission and it makes you a level x mob looking character what's a class of your choosing and you go do a mission for a while?<br />
 <br />
Thinking of picking up DoD so just want to know what I am getting into.<br />

 <br />
Shroud = turns you into a certain Class/level and some abilities associated with that class.  I can shroud as a level 30 rogue and join an LDON of that level and be able to exp with them like normal.  As you progress with each particular shroud, better shrouds become available of that model.<br />
 <br />
Some monster missions I believe also have some form of progression but I am not sure.</div></div><hr />
