<br />
i'm not a healer but i've put together a healing set with a combination of items from normals / heroics / rep rewards and the AH !<br />
<br />
this includes a couple of nice epics that you can purchase in the AH or farm the mats for and get crafted.<br />
<br />
Pants of Living Growth<br />
Gloves of the Living Touch<br />
<br />
some nice rep rewards also will probably help you :<br />
<br />
Lower City Prayer Books - revered rep iirc.<br />
Healing Mace - needs exalted however<br />
<br />
and more than other people will probably remember and be able to point out.<br />
<br />
However the last thing i'll say is that with the soon to be release of Wrath you maybe better off waiting and levelling and getting nice new shiny greens from Northrend ! rather than putting in to much effort now for better gear ?<br />
<br />
the people i know are all currently a bit fed up with Wow and cannot see the point of raiding / running heroics so close to Wrath coming out and seeing all our nice epics replaced in the early 70's by greens as happened in BC :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be worth trying to get the idol of the emerald queen relic from the first boss in Shadowlabs as a kit recommendation over and above what Kheldar mentioned but I will second the LW crafted epics mentioned. They're not desparately expensive to make and are nice bits of kit.</div></div><hr />

Unless you are app'ing MH/BT/Sunwell guilds, you shouldn't have any trouble at all based on your gear.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
But yeah, you're fine.  I healed a kara yesterday with +1430 healing (chugged a few +50 healing potions as well just cause I had them sitting around, didn't really need them) with another druid that had slightly less healing than me.</div></div><hr />
