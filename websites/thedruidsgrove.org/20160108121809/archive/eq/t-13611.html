I know it's been done many times, but I figured there has been a lot of time people have thought over and discussed them to get a better realization of what they will and won't do for our class if they ever get implimented. So here goes.</div></div><hr />

Sure, of course there's something's better than stances we could get, but SoE has never given a single ability (outside of bard fade) to a class with this much power.  If your not happy with that, than quit - it ain't gonna get any better.<br />
 <br />
Another thing - If there's one thing I know about EQ devs is that they don't like to be dictated solutions.  The community has expressed that they want better healing abilities, while others want to keep their dps abilities.  This is a good solution to that, imo.</div></div><hr />

The stances thing probably will not happen cause too many are against it.</div></div><hr />
