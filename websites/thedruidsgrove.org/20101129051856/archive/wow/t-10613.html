<br />
I started out a restro Druid...or should I say a stand-in Preist...Well as you said that after 40 some odd lvl's later I went full feral.<br />
<br />
I will never go back! Way more damage as a feral cat. PvP rules it now and even grouping is better...I can heal in a pinch, however, the aggro aoe is really bad...<br />
<br />
I look for armour that will affect my HP and DPS. Like what a rogue would wear. However, I also have a second or even a third set on armour that I carry. Not always a full set...maybe a set of gloves or boots.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem that I have faced is telling people that I am feral. They hear healing...It is very hard to get people to understand what feral means...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps a bit!<br />
<br />
Rock on.<br />

For the Alliance!<br />

Why can't you go on raids as a feral spec? Is it that your guild requires you to have innervate, or they just &quot;asked&quot; that you be resto spec? If it's the former, after the next patch you will have innervate with any spec you choose. If it's the later, a 30 feral/21 resto spec is fine for any raiding you will do. You won't get the efficiencies a full resto spec will have, but you will have a 20% larger mana pool which almost evens it out. And that spec owns for pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't let anyone force you to specc something you don't want to play. It makes you loose interest in the game. Play as you wish.. some guild will always appreciate you as a feral druid. =)<br />
<br />
There are many &quot;feral druid friendly&quot; guilds out there. You just have to find them in the jungle of elitists. Good luck my feral brother! =)<br />
<br />
Oh.. and feral gear is like MASSIVE in AQ40.. I get everything I point at.. even if I'm at -DKP. :D</div></div><hr />
