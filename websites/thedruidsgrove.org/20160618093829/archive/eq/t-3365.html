I am a happy camper.<br />

Paid way to much for it on Tunare.  Drops of Master Yael in the Hole.<br />
<br />
Good Luck - This is a very nice druid item to help us increase our heal power.<br />

I've seen one sold, And I believe that ended up being traded an RBB or an RBG. I would pay 30k for it now for 1282 non-crit NT's 2550 Crits? /drool), but it wasn't as big a help before this last patch. <br />

Yael gets ganked on spawn because of the SotE, so I haven't had a lot of chances to pop him.<br />

Improved Healing 3 is random, correct? The two you listed being 24 and 25 percent, just checking. =)</div></div><hr />

Swap mine in when grouped and back to Divine Inspiration when soloing agree it makes a nice addition to druid healing.  Although when 2k+ NT land ive had clerics complain about how &quot;good&quot; druid heals are.</div></div><hr />

  He's not hard for a decent duo, I assume slow lands, a 60 shaman should be able to solo him or do him very easily with a decent tank, cleric + meleer shouldn't have a problem either, but I'm not going to try soloing him again any time soon.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You assume wrong.  On three different occasions I've tried to slow, root, and mesmerize him multiple times when he popped up (after tashanian), and he resisted every single spell.  If memory serves, he's a level 55 warrior and hits for 310 -- certainly no pushover.  The only duo I can see pulling this off is a cleric and enchanter with dire charm, and even then I would wonder if the cleric could keep up with the CHs until the guard is dead.<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, save the reply &quot;well a warrior and cleric could do it!&quot;  A warrior and cleric would have an even harder time because (a) the warrior has fewer HP and less damage output, (b) the cleric will have no mana regen, (c) the duo would be very inefficient for anything else (no crowd control, snare, slow), and (d) the warrior wouldn't be able to get out without an expensive gate potion.  Theoretically, if you stick a level 60 cleric and warrior in a controlled test room with top equipment and buffs from other classes and plop a ratman guard in the middle, it might be possible, but practically speaking, it's not.</div></div><hr />

Battle was a little closer than it should have been since we were all not FM to start.<br />
<br />
I have seen about 25 ratman PHs, 1 guard, and 2 slizik the mighty.   both slizik the mighty dropped totems.   thats only counting the one backspawn.   seems that the other 4 spawns are always normal rats.<br />

 <br />
  Monk and 2box cleric have no problems.  A 60 cleric should be able to chain 15+ CHs, which even in a bad case of 3k healed per the gaurd has to do over 45k damage...  On a good warrior with 6k heals that rat has to do 90k damage.  If slow doesn't land a sub 60 shaman couldn't duo it, not sure if a 60 could or not, maybe with a really good tank or a wizard who gets a lucky manaburn =).</div></div><hr />

Note that the named rat can also have the &quot;junk&quot; piercer as loot, which in fact used to be the prize loot (and the idol the junk loot) when the Hole first went live.</div></div><hr />

Never heard of him before this thread and I go to the hole a lot /shrug.<br />

Certainly never camped on the 7th - you pretty much only get the zone groups/people PLing and once you go past the drop off you are on your own.</div></div><hr />
