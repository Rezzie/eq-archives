<br />
I'm a 60 druid on Lightbringer (PvE) with a few peices of Cenarion. My build is 2/11/38 (ish).<br />
<br />
I'm looking for tactic suggestions as well as UI suggestions. I want to completely redo my UI, but hadn't gotten around to it just yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">09-16-2005, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I feel that swiftshifting, feral charge and nature's swiftness are the talents that equate to pvp success. I have all three of those abilities and feel very good about my pvp abilities. You could go without them and still be effective, but not nearly as effective IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-16-2005, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nature's Grasp - check<br />
Feral Charge - check (I still need to get the hang of this; just recently got it)<br />
Nature's Swiftness - check<br />
Swiftshifting - uncheck, I spec'd out of that recently. Had no use since more times than not it's normally more than 6 seconds before I shift back.<br />
<br />
How do you all do you hotkeys/macros? Right now, I have a slight cloogy method of shift-#, # or alt-# to go between any of three hot bars. I've been using cntl-f# to shape shift.</div></div><hr />

Also learn to use the &quot;caster -&gt; travel form -&gt; caster -&gt; bear/cat form&quot; trick to save mana. And when in combat in bear form and out of rage, a quick &quot;bear -&gt; caster -&gt; bear&quot; to generate 10 free rage is great, and if you have a Wolfshead Helm it's even more effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warfur</div><div class="date">09-16-2005, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally half the time I go animal form in pvp, I get hibernated by a tauren druid. So I stick to caster form mostly. Nature's grasp helps a lot, as does nature's swiftness. I'm considering respecing to increase moon fire crits though.<br />
<br />
Frankly most druids don't seem to heal others much during battlegrounds and as a druid who does heal I feel like I help that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">09-16-2005, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">guice you should also invest Talent Points into Improved Bash.  That + Swift Shifting is a huge mana saver and life saver.  The 4 second stun is plenty of time to cast both Regrowth and Rejuv, and shift back within the 6 second Swift Shifting timer ;).   I don't have swift shifting, but I know it really frustrates people when I bash them for 4 seconds and they get to watch all the dmg they dealt go to waste.<br />
<br />
I can't say I miss Nature's Grasp.  I haven't had for a while now and I have managed just fine without it.  It breaks too much for me to see any huge use in it.  <br />
<br />
For UI suggestions, what are you currently using?  If you don't already have it (I am sure most Druids do by now) get Druidbar.  It is the single most helpful tool Druids have.  It allows you to see you current Mana Pool and regen of it while in feral forms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, some contrarian advice here.<br />
<br />
In PvP, forget using forms for anything, pretty much.  They just get you killed.<br />
<br />
Spec innervate, rest in balance for better moonfire, which is gonna be your main damage dealer.  Forms are only for getting rid of root, poly, etc.<br />
<br />
And learn to heal yerself.  And kite.<br />
<br />
Moonfire, travel form, run around in big circle.  Rinse and repeat.  NEVER let any class get close to you.  If they get close, heal yerself on the run with natures swiftness if you have to.  Insta root is great fer getting distance if you get suprised.<br />
<br />
Oh, and innervate cant be dispelled if they arent in range.  Use it if you need to, werks just fine against dispelling classes.<br />
<br />
Finally, not all fights are winnable, but most are survivable.  Sometimes the best you can do is get away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starfire</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  Bear form is for tanking, and cat form is really just in place of rogue tanks.<br />
<br />
What you want to do for a pvp spec is focus on getting moonfire crits high, and work your way down to innervate.  Nature's Grasp is VERY useful if they get too close.  Save the nature's swiftness for an instant regrowth crit, however.  EDIT:  Rejuv spam is gosu with regrowth.<br />
<br />
Moonfire FTW.  If you spec yourself and have good int/spi you will crit for damn good initial damage.  This also keeps rogues and other druids from going stealth/prowl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was a 13 balance 38 resto druid until this patch went live.  Now I'm 9 balance (NG, NR, SS) 11 feral (charge/imp bash) and 31 rest.<br />
<br />
Feral charge is so great for pvp it's not even funny.  Get snared in bear form?  You can still Feral Charge over to another enemy to get out of range on a rogue/warrior.  Improved Bash is great for helping to finish off anyone - or interrupt casting and self heal.<br />
<br />
I even beat a shaman in a duel with my new spec lol.</div></div><hr />
