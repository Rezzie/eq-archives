<br />
You may not have the energy for shred @ #3 there, being that it's 60 energy ( non-talented ) after 50 from pounce and 45 from mangle.<br />
<br />
Talented - mangle drops to 40 &amp; shred drop to 48, but that's still:  90 from a pounce + mangle, and with only 1 tick of energy regen you're only around 30 energy.</div></div><hr />

Bleed buff on Rake?  Or is it mainly an instance PvE skill where Mangle can be followed by any number of Shred since the mob should be facing the tank?<br />
<br />
In the case where I don't get to pounce (2nd mob of a 2 mob pull or when you need to pull with FFF, etc.) do I even bother with Mangle?  Right now I start with Rip, Claw, FFF in this scenario.</div></div><hr />

Today I use Claw as my 5th attack (if needed) in a Pounce'able encounter and 3rd-5th in a non-pounce'able encounter.  So, the &quot;replaces Claw&quot; comment doesn't make all that much sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Mangle replaces Claw: This is because is does more damage than Claw in any situation, and costs the same energy-wise. Once you have Mangle there is no need for Claw anymore.<br />
<br />
2. I do not use Rake anymore. Even with Mangle debuff on the target it does not do enough damage compared to its energy cost.<br />
<br />
3. All ticks of a bleed-debuff that happen while mangle is on the target get the bonus. If you bleed first and Mangle later the bonus counts for the ticks after Mangle is on the mob.<br />
<br />
4. Shred drops to 42 when talented, not 48. They changed that with 2.0 or 2.1<br />
<br />
<br />
My solo-cycle:<br />
<br />
1. Pounce<br />
2. Mangle<br />
3. Shred<br />
4. Shred (when OOC procs somewhere in this sequence before)<br />
<br />
The last Shred does not always work, but often. I also use an energy-tick addon to time my pounce exactly. That way the moment after Pounce uses its 50 energy the next energy tick comes and I am at 70 again. Then Mangle which brings me down to 30, next tick comes 0.5 - 1 sec after that. Then Shred (now I am down to 8 energy). If no OOC proc is in that sequence I use FF at that point, otherwise I use Shred again.<br />
<br />
After that I use Mangle to finish the mob, in combination with a finisher.</div></div><hr />

I also use an energy-tick addon to time my pounce exactly.I thought about this a bit more.  I have no problems getting 2 Shreds off after a pounce now (with Brutal Impact and Shredding Attacks), so I see no reason why I can't get a Mangle&gt;Shred combo off given that Mangle is &quot;cheaper&quot; than Shred.<br />
<br />
So, I don't see the need for an energy bar mob to help &quot;time my pounce&quot;.  I guess if I didn't have Brutal Impact, I might need it.  Though if I timed my pounce, I could get Shred off sooner?!?!</div></div><hr />

Let's assume you start with 120 Energy (a &quot;perfect&quot; pounce), you'll only get 2 more ticks before the mob wakes-up and spins around.  That totals 160 energy.<br />

http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/5464/I finally got around to d/l'ing this over the weekend.  This addon rocks.  Not only does it show energy tick timings, but if you use the &quot;/ew text C: &amp;c  E: &amp;e&quot; command you get to see your combo points and current energy level on the same bar.  If it would show the current targeted mob's health (do i bite, rip or maim?) it would be perfect.</div></div><hr />

- With the talent &quot;Primal Fury&quot; you will get 2 combo points instead of one if your attack is a critical hit<br />

- You can only build up combo points on one enemy at a time. If you hit another target with an attack that grants combo points the ones you collected on your previous target expire.<br />

<br />
OK, I thought so.  My fave finisher is Ferocious Bite. <br />
<br />
I was DPS'ing Blood Furnace one night (PuG).  We were doing a great job, in fact, when this amazingly obnoxious and bossy Shaman hollered at me:<br />
<br />
&quot;Druid!  What are you using as your finisher?&quot;<br />
&quot;Ferocious Bite.&quot;<br />
&quot;NO!  Use Maim!&quot;<br />
<br />
Uhmmm, okee dokey.  So, I started using Maim, but honestly, I didn't see any improvement.  We were already kicking butt.<br />
<br />
Why'd he flinch on me?  What's the difference?</div></div><hr />

I know you go to a lot of effort to present yourself as being very green, but in reality I doubt you are really that clueless.. :&gt;<br />
<br />
The only advantage maim has in the context of an instance is that it can be used to interrupt a mob when it's casting a spell.  For damage, ferocious bite is better.<br />
<br />
For killing a boss, rip works out as more reliable dps in most cases, provided you can keep the Mangle debuff up on your target for the duration.<br />

<br />
Ferocious Bite:<br />
Only if the mob is 10% or lower (Solo)<br />
Only if I have a Rip already applied and we need a DPS boost (Group)<br />
<br />
Rip:<br />
If I get 4 Combo Points before the mob is at 30% (Solo)<br />
As soon as I get 5 Combo Points (Group)<br />
<br />
Maim:<br />
If I need to interrupt a mob healing themselves or if I need a heal. (Solo)<br />
Only to interrupt a spell (Group)<br />
<br />
Rip is always my finishing move of choice. However, FB is sometimes very nice if you're looking for quick and dirty DPS.<br />

Maim is barely used in a group setting because if you're putting combo points on a mob, the Maim will be broken within a second by the rest of the party hitting the mob.</div></div><hr />

So, for leveling it is almost worthless, as Shred &gt; Mangle.  Even with an OoC proc as I could get in 3 Shreds.  Seems like the primary benefit of Mangle is in bear form, not cat form.<br />

It does make a cool sound.  2nd only to the Hunter's Kill Command as my favorite sound effect in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, in a group when you have a tank keeping the mob from facing you, Mangle's enhancement of bleed effects is worthwhile, i.e. Mangle-Shred-Shred-Shred-Rip.<br />
<br />
Aside from soloing, you should keep Mangle up at all times. Even soloing a good case can be made for it. It's your 41 point talent; use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-23-2007, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A far more efficient use of your energy is to not stealth at all, and just run up to mobs and mangle them.<br />
<br />
With a &quot;perfect&quot; pounce you could get 2 shreds.  But 3 mangles will do more dmg than 1 pounce and 2 shreds.  When soloing just run towards mobs and pull them to you with faerie fire and mangle them.  This is the fastest way to farm.<br />
<br />
The only time you need to use pounce is if you definitely need to stun the mob for some reason, eg to avoid getting a debuff, or to stop it casting a spell, etc.  Typically the mobs one chooses to farm tend not to be particularly scary, so pounce is a bit of a waste of energy imo.<br />
<br />
The only time you should ravage is if extreme burst damage is required, as ravage is not very energy efficient - it's just a single massive hit, from stealth.  It's good to use if it will 1shot something (or someone), or if a friend is going to stun a mob for you.  In arenas another feral druid I know pounces and mangles our target, and i ravage and shred.  This means we get the benefit of the stun and the mangle, whilst allowing me to maximise my (not inconsiderable) burst damage.<br />

It seems the answer is anytime you may have used claw before.<br />
<br />
I understand it had a purpose in group PvE.<br />
<br />
The comments above about not using pounce at all and strictly using Mangle seem interesting.  I need to think about that approach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a &quot;perfect&quot; pounce you could get 2 shreds.  But 3 mangles will do more dmg than 1 pounce and 2 shreds.  When soloing just run towards mobs and pull them to you with faerie fire and mangle them.  This is the fastest way to farm.Maybe my math is wrong... it is!!!  Old bad math removed so I can sleep at night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It takes time to restealth and move to the next mob, wait for the energy, and then start dpsing.  Feral druids move fast outdoors - part of the way you can reduce your farming downtime is to reduce the time you spend travelling between mobs.  I'd say I could kill 2 mobs in the time it would take me to kill 1 if I was restealthing each time.<br />

I just ran a few limited tests and the Mangle*X approach isn't all that bad.  Maybe I'll save the pounce method for range types (hunters, casters, rock throwing giants, etc).  Besides, I love pulling with FFF as it appeals to my inner hunter.:biggrin:</div></div><hr />

I also noticed that the damage is higher.  There must be something I'm missing in my above message where I state damage is greater with the PSS method.  I think it has something to do with the DOT Shred uses.  It is not in the abilities' description so I'm not sure how much initial damage Shred does and how much it does in its DOT phase.<br />
<br />
Thanks, for the good tip.  I just might get a bit of enjoyment out of leveling my Druid.  Not I need to determine if I should drop LW for something else.</div></div><hr />

I thought that maybe the issue, but I just don't see the little bit of armor reduction making all that much of a difference.  I think the reduced damage with PSS has something to do with Shred's DOT.  Any one know how that works?  I assume there is some initial damage followed by a DOT, but skill's description doesn't even mention the DOT, but you can see it ticking down on the mob's debuff bar.  So, I think when I hit the 2nd Shred, I lose the DOT effect from the first Shred.  This results in a significant loss in total damage?!?!</div></div><hr />

Although, I do know that patch 2.2 changed Pounce's graphics a bit. They have it now so the little Panther icon shows the stun, and it also has Shred's icon to show the DoT of Pounce.<br />

Shred is direct damage, a &quot;backstab&quot; move that requires you to be behind your target.  The damage of Shred is increased by 30% if your target has the Mangle debuff.<br />
<br />
You are most likely getting confused with Pounce.  Pounce is the cat version of Cheap Shot - it is useable only from stealth, stuns the target, and applies a damage over time bleed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason your damage seems higher is because you aren't wasting 50 energy on pounce at the start of each fight on a stun you don't really require and a dot bleed that is unlikely to run its full duration.  Instead that energy is being spent on an extra mangle.<br />
<br />
To clarify, when in a group with a tank, you do much better damage by mangling once and then shredding.<br />

After you pounce you'll see 2 debuffs on the mob.  The stun cooldown and the pounce bleed.  I had assumed one of those was from the Shred.  That said, there is still something wrong with the damage I'm seeing from Shred vs. Mangle.<br />
<br />
Last night I gathered my combat logs for ~30 mins of play.  During that time I tried to use both PSS and FMMM approaches.  In every case the damage from Mangle was greater than that from Shred.  My (non-crit) mangles would hit for ~240, whereas my Shreds would hit for ~215.  That's almost a 20% increase in damage from Mangle over Shred.  That just doesn't make any sense.  A couple of times I even tried Pounce-&gt;FFF-&gt;Shred to see if FFF was the issue.  The resulting Shred hits were only slightly higher, ~220.<br />
<br />
Any one have any ideas why this is the case?  Looking at the tooltips, Shred should always do more damage than Mangle.  Does Mangle ignore armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-26-2007, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the debuff associated with Pounce was changed to 2 seperate debuffs in a recent patch - the stun component's debuff looks like the Pounce icon, and the bleed component's debuff looks like the Shred icon (which is pretty confusing, hopefully the icon will be changed in an upcoming patch).<br />
<br />
Mangle does not ignore armour.<br />
<br />
Faerie Fire will have the most noticeable effect on targets that already have quite low armour, such as clothies.<br />
<br />
Judging by the damage your abilities are doing at the moment, the most likely reason for mangle doing greater damage than shred is that you are close to getting the next rank of shred, but dont quite have it yet, whereas you have recently learned a new rank of Mangle.<br />
<br />
Shred is more gear-dependent than Mangle.  My shred crits close to double what my mangle crits for because I am wearing a lot of purple gear.  When I was in greens and blues the difference between the moves was much smaller.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can you confirm what level you are at the moment, and what ranks of Mangle and Shred you are currently using?<br />
<br />
Also, do you have the Savage Fury talent?  (increases mangle damage by 10%/20%)<br />

PSS (with my ranks and assuming 100 &quot;base&quot; damage) should do 330 + 369 + 369  == 1068 (no 1806 I listed above).  Whereas FMMM should do 3*X.  Where X is either (1.92*100) + 158.4 == 350.4 or ((1.6*100)+ 158.4)*1.2 = 382.1.  Which means FMMM would do either 1051 or 1146.<br />

Assuming X is 382 rather than 350 (my combat logs seem to support that assumption), it looks like with Savage Fury and my current ranks of Mangle and Shred, Mangle does more damage on paper than Shred by ~20%.

Shred will become the bigger damage move as you level up more, and especially once you are 70 as Shred scales much better with gear than Mangle does.<br />

<br />
Ex.  With max ranks in Mangle, Shred, 2/2 Savage Fury and a base damage of 400.  Shred does 1305 whereas Mangle does 1084.  But at my current level of base damage, the difference favors Mangle.</div></div><hr />

Druids seem to have failed at math, whereas hunters live and die by it.  I think this is mostly due to the fact that we typically either tank or heal.  In which the measure of &quot;success&quot; is &quot;did we survive&quot;.  You just don't see Druid tanks trying to figure out how to maximize threat or tree forms trying to maximize healing.  It just doesn't have to be done.  The lack of math on this site (and most Druid FAQs, etc.) was a real concern of mine when I first starting looking at playing a Druid.  After playing one for some time, I can see why.  It is mostly a non-issue.  Sure their are a few Kitty PvE raiders, but no one expects them to have max DPS.  They were probably brought along to OT and/or OH.  The fact they do DPS when &quot;not needed&quot; is a plus.  If a Druids only role was DPS, there would be quite a bit more math and theorycrafting on this site.<br />
<br />
Hunters, however, are DPS machines and need to do everything to max their DPS.  Maximizing DPS == math.:biggrin:</div></div><hr />

As [feral] druid part of your role (and particularly my role as raid leader) is to look at everything.  CC this mob, kill the dps target.  Heal that person, tank the loose zombie.  Aware of everything, all at once.  Become zen with the raid, as an organic, moving piece of machinery; an organic collection of individual cells each tuned to do a specific job, as red blood cells float through a map of arteries and veins.<br />

With OoC and two piece tier 4, it's not uncommon to get Pounce-Mangle-Shred-Shred off. So until you at least get high enough level to have mangle + OoC, it's probably not worth while to open with pounce unless there are additional considerations (multiple mobs, elite mob, etc).</div></div><hr />
