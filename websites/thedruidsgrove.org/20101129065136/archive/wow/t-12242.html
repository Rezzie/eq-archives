One in season 1 arena gear...other in greens/blues/ithink.  I went back to pvp feral.  I tried healing/DPS'ing for abit.  I tried actual TACTICS, failed.  Then I went bearform and made a complete ass out of myself.  THAT'S when we started to win games.  It is like bearform draws aggro in pvp now.<br />
<br />
Is this right?  Or just a fluke?<br />
<br />
We don't plan on getting in the top whatever, but just a few wins and giggles we're having fun.  :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

Tuff bares also last longer when under fire, and you can see more easily when you're going to need to escape and heal up.<br />

So our 3v3 tactic is to hide the Priest till they all focus on me then he initiates the Face Melting.</div></div><hr />

By the time they all get the idea that I'm the first one they'll try to kill, I'm a tuff bare with 15k health and 264 resilience - meanwhile soft and cuddly resto druid has decloaked at the back and starts pumping heals at me :&gt;<br />

Going bear seems to be a great way to get fire off your team, I used it all the time in battlegrounds when I was feral. I am balance now and if you think bear form is bad you should see what happens when you go into moonkin form. <br />
<br />
I did WSG the other day and had six people trying to kill me while their flag carrier was getting destroyed in the same room. I really didn't understand that one. Needless to say, we won 3:0.</div></div><hr />

Mobs choose their opponents based on an almost universal set of mathematical calculations, themselves designed to be pretty logical. People on the other hand follow psychological trends that are more or less enlightened along a bell curve.<br />
<br />
In WoW this often results in hilarity. People attack bears and moonkin because they're big. This is actually instinctive and very deep seated (see: wooly mammoth). It's the reason billboards are big. It's the same reason people build and like gigantic monuments. Big is attractive. And most people lack the mental discipline to overcome this instinctive response.</div></div><hr />
