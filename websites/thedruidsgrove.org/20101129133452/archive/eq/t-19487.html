WASHINGTON - When Bill Sparkman told retired trooper Gilbert Acciardo that he was going door-to-door collecting census data in rural Kentucky, the former cop drew on years of experience for a warning: &quot;Be careful.&quot; <br />
<br />
The 51-year-old Sparkman was found this month hanged from a tree near a Kentucky cemetery with the word &quot;fed&quot; scrawled on his chest, a law enforcement official said Wednesday, and the FBI is investigating whether he was a victim of anti-government sentiment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Even though he was with the Census Bureau, sometimes people can view someone with any government agency as 'the government.' I just was afraid that he might meet the wrong character along the way up there,&quot; said Acciardo, who directs an after-school program at an elementary school where Sparkman was a frequent substitute teacher. <br />

I wouldn't be surprised if the guy stumbled on a meth lab.  That has to be a pretty major concern for people going door-to-door as they do.  That said, who knows what kind of nuts might be listening to people like Michele Bachmann spout off about the evils of the census.  Here are some interesting theories. (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/25/crazy-census-conspiracies_n_299830.html)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, a number of the articles have pointed out that the guy was a Christian.  Until we know where Tuda was during the time of the hanging...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">09-26-2009, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, there are tons of meth labs scattered in the rural areas of the south.  The labs are actually going down in favor of the new technique for cutting. It uses less &quot;lab&quot;, produces a good yield, and is harder to trace. There is lots of public land to throw away bi products quickly, as well as lots of farms to camoflauge your side business.  Also, another plus, the centralized locations make it easy to distribute large amounts of narcotics to about 60% of the US population quickly.<br />
<br />
The problem mainly is though, the huge amount of anti government sentiments that have popped up over the course of the last 2 years. If you ever want to hear alot of anti government in the south, bring up the civil war in conversation, that will stir up some heated debates with the right people.  I have an incident to share with you though from 2001, when I was still a guardsman.  Right after Sept. 11, most of the government facilities where on higher alerts, so, they posted armed guards at N. Guard facilities, and so on.  <br />
<br />
Well, here in Tenn., I forget where, some angry red neck as far as anyone could figure, drove into a N. guard armory parking lot at night, then attempted to run down the armed guards, before driving off. They ducked out of the way, but, there was quite a debate whether they should have used lethal force. There were a few other incidents, but, I won't mention them around that timeframe.</div></div><hr />
