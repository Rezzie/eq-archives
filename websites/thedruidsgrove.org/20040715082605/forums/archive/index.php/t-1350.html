<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilien Venator</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">www.fohguild.org/forums/s...eadid=2987 (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=58fd50ac4446e0b3e7494919b0cd13b7&amp;threadid=2987)<br />
<br />
 I will assume these are new Class AA abilities because of the format they take is the same as other AA class abilities.<br />
<br />
Most have three forms corresponding to 1, 2 or 3 levels of the ability.<br />
<br />
Druid :<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Wild. Gives a target 350, 500, or 650 damage shield for ONE hit. This is accomplished by including a 1 point rune as part of the effect which otherwise lasts 36 mins. <br />
Because the Rune effect is in slot 1 it only conflicts with the Enchanter AA rune and so if you can somehow make sure that the target is already Runed and KEEPS the rune up through a fight (continually renewing the rune like Bedlam or Uproar) then you can keep the damage shield up all 36.0 minutes... <br />
<br />
Spirit of the Wood. Lasts 5 ticks, give +75 hp/tick 25 damage shield 30 AC at level 1. Level 2 = 100 / 40 / 39 and Level 3 = 125 / 55/ 48<br />
<br />
Superior Cure. Removes 9/12/16 Poison Disease and Curse counters.<br />
<br />
Enchanter:<br />
<br />
Eldritch Rune. Gives a target 350, 500, or 650 Rune at the cost of one cat's eye agate duration 36 mins, casting time 0.5 seconds. Sort of an emergency rune.<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
<br />
Hand of Piety. 750, 1000, 1250 LoH type ability. 72 min refresh<br />
<br />
Wizard:<br />
<br />
Allegiant familiar. + all resist bv 30, + 9 casting level, see invis, +300 max mana + 8 mana regen A new planar familiar for the wizard class. <br />
<br />
Call of Xuzl. Three levels of calling forth &quot;the might of Xuzl&quot;. /shrugs. Putting under wizard since Xuzl was a wiz.<br />
<br />
Magician:<br />
<br />
Servant of Ro. Three levels of new uber Fire pet.<br />
<br />
Host of the Elements. Three levels of something. Looks like it might summon multiple elemental pets to come and kick @#%$ for awhile.<br />
<br />
Necro(?):<br />
<br />
Wake the Dead. Three levels of maybe new uber undead pet.<br />
<br />
The above effect might instead be a Rez AA ability for clerics.<br />
Ranger: <br />
<br />
Guardian of the Forest. Illusion Black wolf for 8 ticks. does 50%/75%/99% Haste and +100/+120/+140 ATK<br />
<br />
Shaman:<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis. 1.2 / 1.6 / 2.0 minute disease-based root.<br />
<br />
Superior Cure (as druid above)<br />
<br />
Bard : <br />
<br />
Boastfull Below. up to 50 point damage and 0 second stun. Might not be an AA but its in the middle of the others and kinda looks like one.<br />
<br />
Beastlord:<br />
<br />
Frenzy of Spirits : 99% Haste and +250 ATK for 8 ticks.<br />
<br />
Hobble of Spirits: adds Hobble of Spirits proc which is a snare proc.<br />
<br />
Paragon of Spirit : 3 levels which adds 100 hp 50 mana / 150 hp 65 mana / 200 hp 80 mana per tick for 6 ticks.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call : Might be 3 levels of AA warder pet. &lt;-- very uncertain</div></div><hr />

But who knows for sure......<br />
<br />
I am really just waiting to see how this patch on Thursday goes, I really picked a good week for vacation from work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both druid ones look pretty exciting but need to have only a couple minutes reuse time imo. Unless it actually is possbible to keep someone permaruned, even if it is it will most likely get nerfed anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, isn't that like a crappy nuke that doesn't stack with rune? Or am I missing something</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glarnor</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, isn't that like a crappy nuke that doesn't stack with rune? Or am I missing something <br />
Well, not only is normal runes in stacking slot 1 so it stacks with those (it does not stack with eldritch rune, but that seems to me to be self-only in the spell_en.txt file), including doing damage, it also mitigates a whooping 1 damage from a random mob that hits you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a massive DS as I read it.  One hit point of rune means it will not really protect anyone.  But at max level the mob will take 600 dmg for hitting the person with it on.<br />
<br />
If it is self only it is surely a suicide abliity.  If you have agro to begin with and then you piss off the mob by doing 600 dmg when they hit you, they are gonna kill your @#%$.<br />
<br />
If it is something you can put on the MA, I think the theory would be a druid chain setting  this ability on the tank at the start of a fight.<br />
<br />
Of course, DS's don't add agro to the person with them on if they are not also the caster so I don't htink it will help hold agro...just like a mana free 600 dmg, probably one shot per fight per druid.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the orignal poster thought it would be possible to keep this up though by having a chanter rune on TOP of this one, so the mob can't dmg down to that one hp and so take off the DS.  If that is so, it is possible for this  to create a truly magnificent amount of dmg.<br />
<br />
My only real question is &quot;is that all there is?&quot;   Not that the druid ones are bad, but AAXP with Luclin added a whole host of abilities.  PAXP (if that is what this is) seems a bit ... thin.  Perhaps this is just the first bunch though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good point, but it will be a very expensive tactic since runes costs one dot for 700 damage and you need to recast it before it wears off, even with using the encs str runes. mobs easily hit for 2-300 a round now, how much won't it be in PoP? =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">09-23-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But on the flip side of that, think of what a sustained 650 dmg shield would do for a guild.  It would be almost impossible to maintain for more than a few minutes, but with chanters chain runing the MA it might be possible to keep that buff up for oh 3 to 5 min...how many hits might that be?  3 x 60 / 6 x 30% ish  = 5900ish dmg.  Might well be worth the trouble, esp if you can push it beyond 3 min (or if the mob lands a hit more than 30% of the time or more than once per round, either of which would increase the dmg dramatically).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am glad they came up with a parlour trick. Maybe it will work out. I hope to god it does.<br />
<br />
That would mean what 10 enchanters in the rune chain?<br />
I am sure someone can do the math taking into account how fast the Cleric CH chain is, and that can heal all HP.<br />
I know how runes work, my math question remains the same.<br />
<br />
Ummm, I'll take the wizard familiar though.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Hit, hit, riposte rune drops DS drops.  It will be truely worthless for anything but VI's in house druid/enchanter powerleveling team.<br />
 <br />
  About the only way I can see keeping this up for any period of time would be on AEless mobs that hits for low damage and rampages occasionally and sticking this on the rampage tanks so runes actually have a decent chance to land on them before a second hit comes in and wipes the rune+DS.<br />
 <br />
  Good luck convinceing an enchanter to waste their time runing a rampage tank so your damage shield can do an extra 20k or something.  The enchanter will tell you to go @#%$ yourself while they chain insanity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wizards get +30 all resists +300 mana pool, + 8 mana regen, and cast at 74th level of ability... on a 'pet' that they can make /go away without losing the buff benefits, that doesn't draw agro, and zones with them, and that doesn't die (because they made it go away.... but its still there.... even though it's away... right?)<br />

You forget that druids get a buff that gives 8AC, 590HP and 8 mana/tick from a mere spell (without paying AA ponts) that they can even cast on others. And another spell that gives 4 mana/tick! :) <br />

Recast time says 0 atm. Well that means the druid could be chaining this lol.  Well dont expect that to stay that way. Will probably be increased to some stupid time like 1hr to make it totaly useless. Target type does say ALL btw so this is a targetable thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Wood. Lasts 5 ticks, give +75 hp/tick 25 damage shield 30 AC at level 1. Level 2 = 100 / 40 / 39 and Level 3 = 125 / 55/ 48<br />

Again with the wood spell. No recast time yet. All depends on what it is if its going to be useless or not. <br />
<br />
<br />
Superior Cure. Removes 9/12/16 Poison Disease and Curse counters.<br />

how hard were those spells to get?  how hard will the new one's be?  If only 5 druids on a server are going to have level 60 ancient spells, how many are going to have the level 61+ spells?  honestly, we dont know.  won't know, till pop's out... but i'm just a lil confuddled by the logic that considers this 'balanced' in terms of aa.<br />

  A spell that can be cast on wizards, meanwhile wizards horde their twin harvests and familiar all to themselves.  God a second harvest is going to be nice, I love when that pops.  Wizards sure ain't shaman, but they aren't stuck in the ghetto of worst mana regen in the game like druids.</div></div><hr />

  Doubtless you don't solo without KEI, and you can buy a cabbage too.  How many druids do you see buying harvest/epic/familiar buffs to go along with their less efficient spells?<br />
 <br />
  It might add to the list of things that benefit the class but even on raids all but 1 of our wizards just takes ancient aego instead of glades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the DS/rune it's hard to tell how effective it will be... I have a feeling it will be a manafree unresistable nuke for raids and potentially be overpowered for groups. If it will be used more or less just like a nuke it better have something like 1min reuse time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bern Fizzlesticks</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing about the rune DS is low aggro (people keep complaining they die a lot as druid *shrug*) for high MR situations or low mana times. <br />
<br />
People tend to think of every spell or skill we get being useful in every situation. Still say we are the tool box with a huge amount of things to do in any case and we have to be the smart ones to figure how when this is going to be key for us and our raids. I have to admit I am a bit excited to see how we make it work.</div></div><hr />

Also, about the 1 pt rune/damage shield thing stacking with enchanter runes - mobs will be hitting way too hard to keep any rune up during a raid, as someone said maybe it could be used on a rampage tank but even then if a mob rampages enough I doubt you will be able to keep it on.  Maybe it can be used to help the MT get initial aggro, but it will take up yet another precious buff slot.   Another use would be for xp grouping if you can somehow convince a very rich enchanter to chain cast rune using up peridots like there is no tomorrow.   I dont see that happening, either, unless the enchanter's guild decides to fund all that peridot usage for xp grouping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But now, it would only be useful for soloing and some group situations.<br />

Wrath of the Wild appears to be yet another skill that druids get to fill out a quota, but lacks any raid usefulness whatsoever.<br />

If there was any way to keep this up on an unslowed bossmob it could literally outdamage the rest of the raid.  By making it 650pts they have to ENSURE that it never actually gets used.  i.e. they have to make it useless.  The very concept of this power is stupid.  If there ends up being some way to make this useful, they will then have to nerf the crap out of it.  I doubt this ability will or was meant to go live.<br />

  Meanwhile they nerfed the cleric reverse shield down to 30.  =/  41 did seem a bit large for something that stacks with every existing shield.</div></div><hr />

End of a boss mob fight, EVERYONE is out of mana, and the melees are all about to die, mob is at 1% needs just a bit more!  Raid leader calls out, &quot;Ok druids, do it!&quot;<br />
<br />
All the druids on the raid (all 10 cause we're gonna be balanced right?) activate wrath of the wild, use their VT Sunder arms on the mob then *sit down* next to it!<br />
<br />
Mob is so annoyed it whacks all the druids one after the other!  Pow pow pow!  6k damage+!  Unresistable!  Druids all dead, but mob dies!  Yay we won!<br />

1) Sitting in WC and killing the skeletons with one hit.<br />
***would be nice, but I already have something they gave me before that does this.  Booboo meet the druids Grove, Druids meet BooBoo. :) <br />
<br />
2) Last act of Defiance?  Nah....Raid_leader yells &quot;Lag is killing the CH rotation.  Druids do that DS thing and Suicide!  We need to reduce this lag!&quot;<br />

<br />
It will be one skill (of many) you know dont have to save up for!<br />
<br />
<br />
It will be a shame that even 10 druids suciciding on a boss at 1% probably wouldnt even kill it because they have so many HP these days ;P<br />
