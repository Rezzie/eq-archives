<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi!<br />
<br />
I need help from experienced healers who are in the Late Content  like MH and BT.<br />
I'm spending a lot of time reading  in forums to find answers to some questions but couldnt find<br />
all the infos i need cause mostly all talk about lower content.<br />
<br />
Im at around 190 mp5 while casting with 400 spirit, 1750+heal and 10k mana selfbuffed. <br />
My guild has SSC clear and is now on Kael'thas. So i want to be prepared for the next step.<br />
<br />
1) How much mp5 is needed to stand a chance in the lategame content. Also im curious cause the top guildie-druids on my server have only around 160 mp5 and over 2100+heal.<br />
So should i aim for more +heal at the cost of some mp5??<br />
<br />
2) Im socketing most of my gear with &quot;Royal Nightseye's&quot; cause i never come out of the 5 second rule, where spirit would kick in. Is this the right thing to do? (Im a lifebloom healer(not only ;D) so keeping all stacks up requires to cast often).<br />
<br />
3) Whats the most efficient healing-type you use??<br />
Lifebloom? Or mostly Reju and Regrowth??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archiee</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is currently (5/5)Hyjal and (5/9)BT.<br />
<br />
You're +healing is good(not great, still enough for MH and early BT), and so is your mp5. I really think most druids under estimate the spirit. Spirit helps you out in the longer fights. Its really a trade off. Spirit is ridiculous in the keal'thas fight because there are breaks in your casting and the fight is a 15 minute +- fight. But I'd like to have more Mp5 during Teron Gorefiend fight, because thats a healing intesive fight that lasts for 4 minutes. I have 562 spirit and when I stop casting for 10 seconds I regain 8% of my mana back.<br />
<br />
If your raid leaders are smart they stick you in the same party as the MT. Well this is because of the tree buff. Don't forget that spirit adds 25% of you spirit to +healing when you heal people in your group. So if you keep your hots up on the MT who should be in your party, you notice a difference when healing people who are not in your party. My raid leaders stick both MT and the off tank in my party, and I can more or less keep them up on my own depending.<br />
<br />
Archimode is another example where spirit is good. If people in your raid can understand the importance of staying alive, and they grasp the concept of Doomfires, then your really only healing the MT, and so is every other healer. So if you take a 15 second break you'll be a much happier person. (at least I am). I STRONGLY recommend the spirit for BT. But your Mp5 gear is great for everything up til Archimode in MH.<br />
<br />
So after all that:<br />
<br />
1) Your fellow druids in your guild are on the same page as I. more +heal and Spirit, at the cost of Mp5. I'm top 3 on healing meters 80% of the time.<br />
<br />
2)Really up to you. Reference everything I said above.<br />
<br />
3) I pass out lifeblooms like gradmas pass out candy to fat kids on Halloween (during trash). During boss attempts I throw all HoTs up on the MT. Careful with Regrowth though. I save that HoT for enrages and things of that sort because that heal spell uses a little more mana then I'd like it to. I use a HoT/DoT timer to keep track on my HoTs on the MT, while is still pass out the lfieblooms to everyone else.<br />
<br />
Ill probably edit this later for spelling. Still early for me.</div></div><hr />

I'd take Spirit over mp5 wherever possible. But only when it brings me more mana in the long run. So I'd never take 5 spirit over 3 mp5 because 3 mp5 is much better. <br />
<br />
As written in the other thread, taking in all factors 1 mp5 equals about 2.73 spirit, assuming you are within the FSR all the time. <br />
For fights where you have breaks to regenerate spirit gets a lot better, and you should have some gear to swap for more Spirit there.<br />
But, when comparing 2 items simply have in mind: without taking the effect Spirit has on Innervate into account, 5.1 Spirit equal 1 mp5; adding an Innervate for a 6 minute cast cycle 2,73 Spirit equal 1 mp5 and for every second you are outside the FSR spirit gets better.</div></div><hr />

I do wish she'd cover +spell crit vs. mp5.<br />
<br />
For me (a feral druid with intensity)...<br />
<br />
+2 int == 1 mp5<br />
+3 sprit == 1 mp5<br />
+11 heal == 1 mp5<br />
+spell crit == XXXX mp5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-05-2008, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the advice. I think i will try to make a mix to max spirit without going under 170mp5, the rest goes into +heal.<br />
<br />
My equip should grow fast now cause im the next one on the T5 items from SSC and TK (if the tokens for druids drop^^).<br />
So i should have 3-4 T5 pieces + the boots from leotheras in 2-3 weeks.<br />

<br />
<br />
Im usually 2nd in the healing meters. 3rd if 2 shamis are in the raid. This fu..... chain-heal is so OP, i cant get past it with my hots :-(<br />
So imba that it heals the whole raid and not only ppl of the party. They should give Tranquility the ability too to heal the whole raid ;-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valkry</div><div class="date">02-06-2008, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your stats are fine imo, especially as you havent gotten much t5 yet, so it will get better once you do. Spirit is a lot better than it used to be, but remember, its how high you get fully buffed that counts (i dont care about unbuffed because fully buffed people tend to be higher than a better geared person unbuffed).<br />
<br />
healing metres aren't important. It's easy to hit the top MT healing but hard when raid healing alongside a shammy, the most important thing is how much hp the boss has at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
I myself am only on 1800 healing, 403 spirit or so and 185mp5 (unbuffed-not self buffed) just entering ssc/tk (nearly on vashj/kael so so far there havent really been any break fights like kael and some further on), but chain chugging pots if needed means i can give my innervate to a priest who will need it because they arent geared enough or right. I'm still aiting on a healing mace so my heals will go up by just above 50 when i finally upgrade.<br />
<br />
Royal nightseyes are ftw, win win win, 2mp5 is better than 4 spirit imo.<br />
<br />
When you get your t5, your stats will shoot up. You do have 1k more mana than me though, with mp5/spirit huge mana isnt always necessary.<br />
<br />
PS: lifebloom stack...always, rejuv can accompany it, but always have lifebloom up, its just win. When you hit 570mp5 you can chain cast lifebloom without ever losing mana lol, cant wait for that day :)</div></div><hr />

You entitled to your opinion. But when I stop casting for 10 seconds and regenerate nearly 10% of my mana. Then have an extra 135.25(unbuffed) +healing on the MT and the OT who are constantly taking dmg, and are constantly being healed by LifeBloomx3 and rejuv, Im pretty sure spirit is pretty FTW too.</div></div><hr />

Fixed it for both of us :) Both are good. I just prefer to have a bit more mana regen during the casting periods than have more during the times when we don't have to cast, as not all fights have it. You get more mana regen during the short non-casting times, whereas I get more regen during the longer constant casting times. But yea, both are good, cos resto druids are awesome :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are ALOT of bosses out there when there is no healing to be done. I can make a huge ass wall of text of bosses and examples. Granted there are definatly bosses they I never get outside the 5SR. Teron Gorefeind is one of them. Then there is serpremus fight where during the kite phase you pretty much get all your mana back, because if your guild knows how to stay away from volcanos no one should be taking dmg.<br />
<br />
Point is, I know how boss fights go. I know healing intesive ones. Thoes ones I use mana pot around 80%. Then when I get down to 30% after that I use innervate. If I get close again I use another mana pot. I have yet to go below 10% mana on any boss fight since karazhan maybe when I was in blues/greens. I'd rather use spirit because of the extra +healing I do on the tanks, and about 70% of the bosses have some sort of break if you know where to find them. My raid keeps me around because I'm usually top 3 on healing meters, so I must be doing something right. Havnt heard complaints.</div></div><hr />

I'm not (and probably never will be) far enough in the raid progression to see such bosses.</div></div><hr />
