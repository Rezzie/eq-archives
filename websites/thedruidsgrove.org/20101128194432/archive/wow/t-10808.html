<br />
you have to specify because every type has a different optimal weapon selection...<br />
<br />
and also, what level are you? 60?<br />
<br />
fists are really rare until late in the game... the first blue fist i can think of comes from stockades and even then its not that great... i never bothered with fists cause i never saw any of them witch an exception for one or two here and there...<br />
<br />
staff is always good for restro druids... it has all the right stats usually... int, spi, stam, and healing... maces are better for bear druids because they're the ones with the usual str and stam stats for feraling (i don't know if i just made a word there)... or daggers for cats with their agi boosts athough i rarely see a dagger druid... <br />
<br />
and also, do you even use your weapon? or is it mainly for stats? as a druid, i rarely find myself swinging my weapon... its  pretty useless besides the stat bonuses... and don't be afraid to go two handed maces as well because they sometimes offer better str,agi, or stam stats than an one handed mace and an offhand combined... and offhands come rare early on as well...<br />
<br />
and one last thing... remember, weapon procs don't work in your forms... things such as firey enchant will never proc when you're in cat form...<br />
<br />
if this is a question regarding pure asthetics... i would say go with the fist... a night elf with a shiny brass knuckle looks pretty cool to be honest... just don't be carrying a sissy stick in the other hand... it'll make you look like a fairy...</div></div><hr />

The reason ist that cat needs a lot of attack power and esecially with HotW (which I assume you are going for when you are mainly playing in cat form) strength is the way to go. Of course that doesn't mean that agi is not important, especially for the higher crit chance. As a bear tank on the other side, you will need more agi to evade hits and to increase your aggro generation with more crits.</div></div><hr />

Even tho it's a terrible druid weapon, if your in a raid guild you could prob' get one 'cause they aren't very popular with the melee... in my guild no one batted an eye-lash when a shaman took one.<br />
<br />
**Edit**<br />
<br />
For the OP, get whatever weapon has the stats you fancy.  There's caster maces and melee staves... type of weapon really doesn't matter.  I myself prefer 2handers since I carry multiple weapons ATM and 1hander+off hand take up more bag space.</div></div><hr />

Rotate them around so as to keep them all leveling.  You never know what you will end up with down the road.  <br />
<br />
That being said, for melee most druids tend to lean to 2handers.  This usually being maces.  This is because the druids nature, the stat distribution for melee tends to favor 2 hand maces for the heavier stat allocation than 1hander.  There are some good melee 1 hand maces which can be acquired once you start raiding however.  The only problem is that there is little for feral in ways of offhand.  <br />
<br />
But like I said you never know what you will use.  A good staff with melee stats will suit you just as well, and the new feral weapon that everyone is drooling over is actually a staff.<br />
<br />
Anyways, most of the time you will melee in cat or bear.  But do take the time to duke it out in caster a bit in order to keep you weapon skill increasing.  Later on you may have to use that skill while playing a casting role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While leveling, for feral based gear find anything that is from the &quot;of the Bear&quot; line.  Tiger(STR/AGI) and monkey(AGI/STA) are also suitable, though Bear (STR/STA) is the best bet for leveling.  There is not best weapon while leveling.  Just find suitable stats and go with it, you will outlevel everything before too long.<br />
<br />
Once you start grouping more try and get some INT items too, for when you need to cast more.<br />
<br />
Later you will have more gear options available.  Like I said start with some good STR/STA items.  Work from there.  There are also plenty of threads listing numerous items available.  Just do some research and go where you need to get them.<br />
<br />
Here I'll get you started.<br />

i think that druids should be able 2 use dual wield fist wepons it would be alot 2 help...besides the druids have bad weapon choice now though it doesnt matter for feral druids it can become handsome</div></div><hr />
