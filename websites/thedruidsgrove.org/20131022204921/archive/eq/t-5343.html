/autoinventory takes what is on your pointer and puts it in the first available inventory slot.<br />
<br />
Great for a forage hotkey.<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/doability X, pause 60<br />
/autoinventory<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
(Replace X with whatever number your forage is on).<br />
<br />
EDIT: For this to work in lag... need to include the pause command.</div></div><hr />

Just forage away, not worry about it and then clean up your bags after the adventure. I like it! Thanks Paldor! =)</div></div><hr />

Now, how long will it be before people figure out how to bind that to their gamepad and do some AFK foraging for their epic pieces? :)</div></div><hr />

Locked thread from EQTraders about using /autoinventory and programable mices for cntrl clicking and such...<br />
<br />
Locked because it dances too close that gray area we call the EULA...=P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some say buying a programmable gamepad/mouse to ease up the EQ keystrokes is enough to violate the EULA.  Others say mouse/keyboard macroing while babysitting EQ is okay.<br />
<br />
What the heck is the truth?<br />

I remember a time long ago when someone was banned for unattended macroing.  There was a big flap over it, people saying they needed their game pad for the sake of their wrists or because they had a disability and SOE said something like &quot;fine, you can use them, just don't walk away from the computer and do unattended macroing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">10-21-2003, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd think, since you're not acutally doing anything, after you hit autorun and go afk, EQ no longer recieves any keyboard/mouse commands from you, so it's not really unattended macroing. It's about as macroing as sitting afk somewhere, and like leaving a bard song on overnight to work up those slow ass music skills =-(<br />
<br />
But a minor case could be made for either one I guess, since you're raising a skill well you're not there, but *shrugs* I doubt most people, GMs included would care, so long as you're not impeding someone elses gameplay somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if you stopped swimming every 30 seconds to cast a low level spell for practice, then go back to swimming, you better be within eyeshot of the keyboard. ;)<br />
<br />
What the spirit of that rule means is that they don't want you loading up you toon with 2000 simple combines then opening up a brew barrel, hitting go, and going to bed. They have no problem with you standing at the brew barrel and doing 2000 combines, but you need to be &quot;there&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leaving a bard standing there all night singing Chorus of Marr is not macro'ing.<br />
<br />
Twisting 3 songs while leaving a bard standing there all night is. ;)</div></div><hr />

Nice tip Padlor - thanks! :) :) :D<br />

If there's one gripe I had about the Luclin era custom EQ interface, it was that it wouldn't allow you to have an auto-equip button anywhere except the inventory window.  This kinda works around that.  /cheer - rocks for foraging!</div></div><hr />

As for gamepads, they've got no problem with them mostly.  It's only unattended macroing that is the big deal.</div></div><hr />

My run button had Sence heading and Forage on it to practice them and I used to hate getting things stuck on my cursor while running through dangerous zones, especially no drop items.  Now that they will give newbies 200 sence heading they will never know the joy of 10000 button clicks to skill it up.   That should also speed up the foraging for the epic forages for those that still have to do that part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xylobot is probably what they're fussing about - you can literally have your toon walking around, joining into/out of groups and assisting with battles, doing trade skills, responding to /tell requests for buffs etc with that prog.  Some elements (e.g. buff machine) completely unattended, others (grouping) done via 'remote' /tell commands from another player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perk</div><div class="date">10-26-2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have personally used a programable joystick to skillup my twink rogue... set one of the buttons to repeatedly press the 'u' key... parked the rogue in Befallen at the locked door and watched a movie... came back and he had 200 lockpick.  I don't really see any problem with using tricks like this to eliminate annoying timesinks in the game.  The skill doesn't go up any faster than it would if I was sitting there clicking by hand, it just doesn't require my attention.<br />
<br />
With that said, I'm not using an application to do it... the joystick is simply another means of inputing keyboard strokes.  To my way of thinking... its no diffenent than getting one of those pecking bird perpetual motion toys to peck the U key for you repeatedly =P</div></div><hr />

That was specifically what they banned someone for a while back.  Unattended macroing.  They didn't care it was his gamepad, he just wasn't there to respond to a problem he was causing.</div></div><hr />

Now I've just appended forage &amp; autoinventory to several of my already in-use macros.<br />
