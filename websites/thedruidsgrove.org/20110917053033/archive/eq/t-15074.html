If you're looking for a progression oriented guild that won't burn you out with 5 day mandatory raiding, then check us out.  <br />
<br />
We are a relaxed, mature guild filled with people that have jobs, kids, and many other responsibilities.  Raids are on Pacific time Monday and Friday, starting at 7:30pm and ending at midnight usually.  <br />
<br />
Cantus Fidelis recruits the person, not the toon.  Please look elsewhere if you're interested in a springboard to another guild; we are looking for dedicated and active people who are interested in being part of the progression and advancement of a guild, who want to advance their characters, and who want to make some good friends in the process.<br />
<br />
Cantus is currently in Uqua and will be starting on DoN dragons and MPG Raid trials after the new year.<br />
<br />
Visit our website at http://www.cantusguild.net and check out our Guild of the Week post (http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/news_article.vm?id=50288) on EQPlayers for more information.</div></div><hr />

Still looking for druids though!</div></div><hr />
