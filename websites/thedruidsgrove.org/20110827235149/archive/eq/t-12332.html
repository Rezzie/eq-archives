I think they are from Thundercrest (based on other items with IDs close in Lucy). I've camped and killed lots of nameds in Thundercrest but with no luck finding these.  I was hoping someone might be able to point me in the direction or a particular named or area where these drop.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Both ends/rooms have named mobs/phs, shoulders drop from one of those if I'm remembering correctly.   Msomething The Rector is sticking out in my mind, might be him but it's been a while so hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Henora</div><div class="date">10-12-2005, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the only piece of information I had managed to uncover indicated it might be that back area but there was no named specified and I know the drops for all the other named in the area there.<br />
<br />
Additionally, they seemed to have moved some of the named spawns out of the Creator area in the DOD patch..  <br />
<br />
there was:<br />
Hidetora (creator front, spawn removed)<br />
Cleric neck, plate bracer<br />
<br />
Kodama the Voltaic (goat under steps)<br />
65/65 ring, ranger mask<br />
<br />
Hidezaku (back room golem guard, spawn removed)<br />
wizard ring, chain gloves<br />
<br />
Mihoko the Rector (back room, spawn removed)<br />
SK mask, plate sleeves<br />
<br />
??? in the other back room (this room changed, but never saw a named here)<br />
possibly drops the thornbrush shoulderpads?<br />
<br />
<br />
SOE is conspiring against me to make it so I cannot find this item. :(</div></div><hr />

 <br />
P -2405.8530, 704.1266, 172.9354, 0, 0, 0, 2, Fumi_the_Vigilant<br />
 <br />
If that ends up being in the room opposite Mihoko the Rector then that's the ph. <br />
 <br />
But now that I read what you said about spawn removed I remember hearing something stupid being set up in thundercrest that makes it so on server up among all the named spawn pts only a certain batch will be flagged to have their named pop, and only those name will pop until anohter patch/server up where another set of named will start popping.</div></div><hr />
