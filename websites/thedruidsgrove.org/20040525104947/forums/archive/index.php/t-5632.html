Another thread reminded me of this oldey but goody.<br />
<br />
It requires Quicktime.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if he ever tried BeOS (an OS that didn't suck but was never really advertised thus failed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Linux was never advertised either, at least not until Red Hat and some others got a hold of it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cloudien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's the &quot;until&quot; part that's important :)<br />
<br />
Palm got a hold of it, and kinda... swallowed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>B_Delacroix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was around when OSes used to work.  My face turns crimson with rage when I see shoddy progamming at work (or not work as the case is) knowing that it can be done better but for lack of care.<br />
<br />
After all, its hard to justify making a new version if the previous one works already and a lot easier to make excuses like &quot;its too complex&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hadn't seen that before...that's cute =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fyyr Lu'Storm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think I have ever met a person who has worked in IT, and not found this funny as hell...<br />

Old as internet dirt, but what can I say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cloudien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Brilliant :D<br />
<br />
(Being internal I(C)T support for a small-medium organisation is bad enough, that just brings it all out!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ndainye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That 2nd one is soo true they even played it for us during Dell Tech Training :)  <br />
<br />
I never thought trying to explain to someone the difference between their monitor and cpu tower would be soo difficult :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kanissa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, I do tech support for a college of 800 students, plus faculty, staff, *cough*  the president's secretary...Even with only 2000 people, it's frustrating as hell.  We love that video to death.<br />

(By the way, I'll have to show the OS Song to one of my co-workers, who believes OS X is infallible  ;) )</div></div><hr />
