I killed to tainted, and nothing popped. Nothing on track. There was one &quot;Aqua Goblin Shaman&quot; on track, but it was not anywhere reachable. Track might have been messed up. Are these broken everywhere?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the other tainted/corrupted are like that as well, like the gorilla in EJ.</div></div><hr />

Good luck in getting that Corrupted!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other Tainted?  there are a few who actually work like the goblin, sometimes there is a way of telling whether it will actually spawn the tainted before killing it.<br />
<br />
The ones I can remember.<br />
The Fish in Lake of Ill Omen.  Pull it to the shore and walk onto land.  If it follows you onto land it WILL spawn the tainted, remaining in the water means it is a dud.<br />
The Gorilla in EJ, if it is an undead looking gorilla (eg pieces of skin missing etc) it will spawn the tainted, else your out of luck.<br />
<br />
I know the gorilla took me about 8 corrupted to get, the goblin took 2 and the fish took 4.<br />
<br />
Wish you lots of luck, but seeing the corrupted shouldn't get your hopes up too much.</div></div><hr />

Was horrible.<br />
<br />
It is totally random, so you could be there for 20 minutes or 15 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I camped that guy on at least 3 full evenings, getting nothing but the ocassional Tainted. On a 4th evening some friends were there camping Lord B and I asked to come down and help if no one needed the Tainted's.<br />
<br />
I no sooner hit return on my 'I've been here many nights and this guy just won't spawn' when he spawned. And just after I looted, HE SPAWNED AGAIN. Go figure!<br />
<br />
Fast forward a few months and my guild cleric is now camping Lord B. I am there with my rogue tanking for her. She had been camping Lord B for a few nights. Lord B spawned, she gets the crown and heads to do turn in. By the time I get back to PoK, Lord B spawned back to back. So now my level 35 Cleric has a started his epic.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that spawn is so erratic you can go minutes or days.. I have one druid friend that took 3 months to get that spawn.</div></div><hr />

I killed prolly like 15 tainted in the water and never spawned one, so finally decided to pull it up on land above.  Maybe dumb luck but it spawned that 1 time I pulled it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just get lucky.<br />
<br />
Killed about 8 hours at this camp to get my corrupted to spawn.. when he did another tainted spawned, and a second corrupted right after that.<br />
<br />
Overall I think it is just a bug.</div></div><hr />

The tainted ones that won't spawn a corrupted won't follow you out of the water.  Actually pulling the barracuda out of the water doesn't change whether it'll spawn a corrupted, just indicates whether it will.<br />
<br />
I have no idea if that applies to the aqua goblins.  It's possible they work the some way...I had no idea it was possible for a tainted aqua goblin not to spawn a corrupted.  I guess I was just lucky getting a corrupted from my first tainted (though it did take quite some time for that tainted to pop).</div></div><hr />
