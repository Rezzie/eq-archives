<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit playing when PoP came out.  I am about to start playing again.  All items which were not &quot;no drop&quot; have been given away and all cash, although money should not be a huge problem.  <br />
<br />
I know there has been a lot of content changes and new items so I am just looking for some advice on what sort of things I might look for.  I either group or raid.  If I cant do those things I will quest or tradeskill.<br />
<br />
My character is level 60, has a few AAs, epic, POTC earrings, full set of that armour that drops in Umbral Plains, the 7th shawl.  My guild is a &quot;family type&quot; guild, currently doing slow grind for Emperor but otherwise highest thing it has killed is AoW (obviously I would have to do a few raids before I could expect any major items, but could no doubt get ToV type loot fairly quickly just on the &quot;it will rot anyway&quot; theory).<br />
<br />
I would anticipate my main short terms goals would be to get to level 65, complete the 8th shawl and do some raiding.<br />
<br />
So the advice I seek is:  what should I go for in terms of items to quickly gear up for some basic adventuring.  I will get a set of resist gear fairly quickly.  <br />
<br />
Grateful for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get flagged/levels for bastion of thunder and start looking for some ornate leather boots, sleeves, gloves, bracers etc.<br />
<br />
Those items have excellent affects that will greatly enhance your druid.<br />
<br />
Boots = Mana Preservation<br />
Sleeves = Improved Heals<br />
Gloves = Mana off on Summers Flame<br />
Bracers = FT2<br />
<br />
Plus overall better stats that UP or SS gear.<br />
<br />
BoT is also an excellent source of level 63 to 65 spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might want to compare a few other items such as:<br />
<br />
Large Smoothmetal Torque<br />
Bellows Crafted Cap<br />
Veil of the Executioner<br />
<br />
These are pretty common PoP loot drops that have surprisingly good stats and can be very cheap upgrades.<br />
<br />
In addition, I'd recommend checking out some of the new Storm Rider gear (crafted).  A couple of pieces are decent upgrades from Elysian and are often available in the Bazaar.<br />
