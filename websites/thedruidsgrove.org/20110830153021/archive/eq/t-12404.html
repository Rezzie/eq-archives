<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DattasCT</div><div class="date">10-20-2005, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This forum has been an excelent source of information, and I'm posting to get some ideas from the druids that have &quot;been there done that&quot; already. My guild is in the process of moving through Ssra now, and VT in the semi-distant future. I have raiding experience as do a few in my guild, but we are somewhat short in numbers, so I will be filling mutliple roles depending on what classes we have in the raid. My main before I took about 18 months off was a 65 enchanter, and I have already experienced PoP progression. I did not experience luclin preogression at all on the enchanter though, which leads me to my question. What is it I should look forward to in gear upgrades as we move through ssra, and what is worth waiting for in VT? This is my first priest class character, and I already have a few focus effects that I thought were important. Also, my guild uses a DKP style system for loot if that matters at all. Thanks for any tips offered. :) <br />

If you are progressing, definately gear up  there. I believe as a druid you can fill most slots from the drops there and have a plethora of mana regeneration. I still wear quite a few VT items. I loved raiding Vex Thal, and I think it's still my favorite zone. I wouldn't mind going back. If you get a good strat down, you can own the whole zone in like 6 hours.</div></div><hr />

So I here is a large list of items with rare focus effects from the zone.<br />
<br />
Bracelet of the Shadow Hive   I only wish everyone in my guild had one of these.<br />
<br />
The effect on Talisman of Vah Kerrath is still used by some post time peeps I bet.<br />
<br />
Tiny Bone Bracelet	who doesn't want to look like a Skeleton<br />
<br />
Bone Earring of Evasion I do not know how many times Invisibility versus Undead would just rock.<br />
<br />
Boots of Warding	Manasink Increase Absorb Magic Damage by 250<br />
<br />
Silver Skin Gauntlets  Silver Skin Increase Absorb Damage by 150 dang I just might have to go back and get me this one.<br />
<br />
Crimson Ring of Judgment	Koadic's Expansive Mind extra mana anyone<br />
<br />
Twilight Shroud	Lunar Whispers Talisman of Vah Kerrath effect will over right it but still who doesn't want to go over the mana regen cap.<br />
<br />
Armguard of Piety	Abolish Poison  Heck I still use it from time to time<br />
<br />
Gloves of Warding	Resistance to Magic is nice but it does take up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
Nightcaller Leggings  Wind of the Nightcrawler this was about the only focus item I thought you may not be able to match from AuGs.<br />
<br />
Crimson Headband	 Aura of Red Petals Resistance to fire but it does take up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
Pearls of the Frozen Wind	Aura of White Petals Resistance to Ice but it does take up a buff slot.<br />
<br />
Dark Mace of Thought  Theft of Thought the idea of taking mana from a mob and given it to myself always sounded cool.<br />
<br />
String of Beaded Slime  Aura of Green Petals Soul Energy more resist<br />
<br />
Aegis of Judgment	+80 AC +20 Sta +10 Dex +25 Wis +18 vsMg +18 vsFire +18 vsCold +18 vsPos +18 vsDis +120 HP +120 Mana 20.0 Wt   I am guessing this would still be sweet to someone at this level of the game.<br />
<br />
Mail of Judgment	+65 AC +25 Sta +25 Agi +25 Wis +20 vsMg +20 vsFire +20 vsCold +20 vsPos +20 vsDis +125 HP +125 Mana 2.0 Wt	  Again just guessing this would still be sweet to someone at this level of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lhittle</div><div class="date">10-21-2005, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talisman of Vah Kerrath is a worn effect, not a clickie...The only bad part about that item is that it has no augmentation slot, but with the stats on it, it really didn't need one at the time that augments came out.<br />
<br />
An item that I wish I had, is off Shei Vinitras http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8880<br />
is the shadowed Storm Sphere, which stacks with any clickie mana regen item other than <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32669<br />
Brazier of Endless Flame which has a larger rune.<br />
<br />
Either of these items drop when you get hit, but until then they crank out an extra 3 mana per tic<br />
<br />
Shei is definately doable for a guild that is raiding Vex Thal and Ssra</div></div><hr />

Shei orb has a 150 hp rune and doesnt stack with beastlords SA line of buffs.  Brazier gas a 451 hp rune and stacks with SA.</div></div><hr />
