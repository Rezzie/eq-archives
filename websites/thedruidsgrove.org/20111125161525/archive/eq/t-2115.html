Anyone have any advice for a 57 druid to solo here? Anyplace with exp is bonus, don't need any leather drops as I am trying to get the woven grass from HoT. Just really want to kill them giants for faction mostly.</div></div><hr />

They also drop brooches that can be turned in 3 at a time for an extra faction hit.</div></div><hr />

Call of Karana works on a few of the wolves though.<br />

You will have a very rough time at 57 though.</div></div><hr />

Can anybody give any first hand experience with doing this approach? Sort of a case study would be helpful. I need to hunt primarily for faction. Would love to drag the wolf to Arena for possible armor drops, but I imagine the Arena giants summon, too, so that may make a ping pong game where druid = ball.<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They regen well, so as long as its only fighting one thing it should take no more healing than a chloroblast every 2 fights or so, unless captain bvellos wanders by, or you pull from tormax ramp.</div></div><hr />

May save you a few CR. Also good if you need to complete PureBlood quest. <br />

<br />
I went into the arena area and there were 2 mobs in the pit fighting. One of them was a wolf named Black Fang. He conned even (to lvl 1) but was fricken huge. I wanted to see how hard he hit, so I jumped in the pit and attacked him. 160ish hit. Anyone ever tried to DC this guy to solo, or for a Vindy fight?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm powerlevelling an enchanter to be able to dire charm in Kael (among other places)...I'll have to watch for him when I finally do start hunting there.</div></div><hr />

They spawn on their own, and they can be triggered by handing in tickets to some giant (name which I cant think of off the top of my head).   Anyways there is 2 wolves that can spawn in there, Blackfang and Deathfang.   Both hit for 160-170ish and are undercons.   You can DC these, they are very powerfull, I can solo in arena with them very easily.   Just getting to them is a problem if you are kos, but having a non kos friend pull one out works wonders.   Ohh and they run on no faction, so are indiff to all.</div></div><hr />

Where or what drops the tickets and what giant do you turn them into?  I just recently got DC and would love to try this in Kael.  <br />
<br />
Also where is this pit that they spawn in?  Is it where all the wolves are or is this somewhere else?<br />

The &quot;pit&quot; im talking about is the actual PVP arena south of where Vindy spawns. If you go straight thru the see invis tunnel, its right in there and up some steps.<br />
<br />
It seems he and his giant buddy he's fighitng in the arena only stay up for about 2 mins if not aggro'd. Their repop time is &gt; 25 mins (I had to go to a raid) I'll log on my vindy spotter and watch the spawn again tonight and try to gather more info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure this out.<br />
<br />
From what I found: <br />
<br />
To get to the arena, it's just past the first set of see invis mobs.  If you go left or right, you'll end up at the ramps to right and left arena, respectively.  go straight and you'll go up some stairs ( i had to jump because i'm a halfling.  also, with soe on, i couldn't make it up either because the stairs were too tall. )<br />
<br />
You can purchase tickets from a giant on the right.  he appears to be on a different faction than kromrif/zek, because i was dubious to him, while being kos to both rif and zek.  He wouldn't sell to me, but i click spammed him and eventually he let me browse.<br />
<br />
i bought several tickets and gave them to my kael scout (rallos zek warrior, level 1)<br />
<br />
i assume that you then turn them in to Vykor, who is also in the arena, but dubious faction isn't enough apparently, because he wouldn't accept the tickets from my scout.  i didn't have the willingness to faction a toon up in order to do the ticket turn ins.<br />
<br />
so, i sat there and waited.  eventually, a dog popped.  level 1, but an undercon obviously.  he was indifferent to me, and so was the other giant that spawned in the arena.<br />
<br />
the first time, i hit the dog with burst of flame to see if it would run out of the arena or warp on me.  he ran straight at me and then eventually depopped.<br />
<br />
the second time, i jumped down into the arena, and immediately dire charmed the dog that popped.<br />
<br />
info on dog: <br />
<br />
huge.  tiny companion didn't change his size, unfortunately.  <br />
<br />
With pot9, he didn't really have all that many hit points.  i'm guessing around 5k or so.<br />
<br />
Hit for 79 max from what i saw.  i pulled a gladiator from the next room to gauge his effectiveness against the other arena mobs, and found that i darn near ran oom trying to heal the dog.  i did win the fight, but was unimpressed with the dog's offensive capabilities and lack of serious hit points.<br />
<br />
i didn't have any magi gear with me, so i'm sure that a muzzle, a couple of swords and the 500hp belt may have helped somewhat, but i seriously doubt that you would be able to use this dog as a super tank to solo the whole arena effectively.<br />
<br />
the next issue is that, since you can't make the dog warp to you, you have a couple choices to try and get it out of there.  <br />
<br />
first, you could attempt to kill the two gladiators, and the three protector of zeks.  i know that i can't single pull them at 65.  i usually have cleric or chanter pacify them to single pull.  fighting three pozs at once is suicide, so this option is essentially out.<br />
<br />
you could bind yourself somewhere outside of the arena, and gate, hoping that the dog would eventually find its way to you, although dc pets now take on your faction, and would most likely be dead by the time it found its way to you.<br />
<br />
or the option that would be most successful, would be to have a non-kos person tag him, and then run him out to you.  however, unless you know someone that isn't kos and would be willing to either hand in tickets or wait for your dog to pop so that you could try and solo mobs, you are out of luck it looks like.<br />
<br />
with how difficult this is to get setup, i would much rather take my chances with command of tunare on a higher level dog.  they are easy to get to, relatively easy to control, except for the summoning part, and seem to do pretty good damage.  more damage than the dog that i direcharmed did.<br />
<br />
don't let this discourage you from making your own findings, this is just what i observed while trying to figure this out.<br />
<br />
good luck ;)</div></div><hr />
