Anyone wanna save my eyesight and know the exact text for the proc?</div></div><hr />

Some creatures who are called Summoned so-and-so's  will give me a message &quot; this only works on summoned creatures&quot; ?? Just what will it work on? <br />
Is  there list somewhere of which mobs Annihalate and the lower level versions  actually have worked on? <br />

<br />
AtU works on Summoned and Constructs.<br />
<br />
If mobs are flagged correctly (which is fairly hit and miss), AtU will land on:<br />
<br />
Summoned:  Elementals, Summoned Creatures, so forth<br />
Constructs:  Golems, Gargoyles and the like<br />
<br />
If you think a mob should be summoned, and it's not - /bug it.<br />

Perhaps, like me, many druids have not bothered to load up the spell since its rare to find anything that responds, so I will be trying it out in raids to see what it works  and post my findings as I come across them.<br />

<br />
Offhand, raid mobs i can think of are Zi-T in Demi, plus gargoyle trash and the Gargs in MM event.<br />
<br />
ToB trash gargs and Valik the Cruel.. and Enforcers/Watchers in the first DK event (we're not past that yet so can't comment further).<br />
<br />
Basically any Gargoyle in DoDH it works on.. Aside from obviously elementa looking mobs, i havent tried it on any other trash from either expansion.. and don't frequent other expansion enough to bother testing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">05-09-2007, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's a wonderful, wonderful spell and I love it! 32k procs rarely but it does and it's great. And like it's been already mentioned, it works on constructs too. Thalassius missions, puddles and golems there... boom boom! Zi-Thuli in Demi and gargoyles etc etc. I have yet to seen it resisted and usually hits for high damage and I get 7-8k crits often. Way more than with fire or ice nukes. Or maybe just my imagination...</div></div><hr />

In addition to the ones mentioned, I have found it works on these mobs as well.<br />
Relic- A roving cyclone<br />
Thallasius-sea dervish, puddle of water, elemental construct, elemental watershaper, construct of surf ( I believe more probably in this zone, the whirlwind models, constructs and puddles or different names and I shall check as I do various missions)<br />

<br />
I've also noticed that it does crit more then either our Ice or Fire DD spells.  I have the most fun with the spell in Ashengate West where it lands on *all* of the statues, goos, and elementals.<br />
<br />
For those asking about making audio triggers, the 32k proc emote phrase is:<br />
&quot;Explodes in a burst of elemental energy&quot;<br />
<br />
I made a custom audio trigger from an old Firesign Theater spoof on the 79's era &quot;AVON Calling&quot; radio commercials.  Here it is:<br />

I tried out Annihilate spell on the steamworks and clockworks and to my joy it worked! Not sure if everyoen already knew that, but was news to me :) So hopefully this spell will be useful also in SoF.</div></div><hr />
