I don't get it. The kicker for me is it seems like primarily a point blank AE spell. On top of that is the 3 minute cooldown. Right or wrong, given the way I have speced I could either take this or typhoon. I chose typhoon because it seemed like a tool I could use much more often. What am I missing and where does it shine?</div></div><hr />

It shines in AoE and AoE only.  But, the good news, almost ever raid encounter (Except Malygos) has a large AoE component to it.  I would like to see the 3 min CD removed, but Boomkins would be simply OP. With Starfall up, and Hurricane rolling, I am usually doing about 2k damage per tick, per target.  Let that soak in...PER TARGET!  So when you have say 10-15 mobs beating away, I am putting out 20k-30k damage per second.  <br />
<br />
In all fairness, its only about a 20%-25% of the hit strength of Hurricane, but its a nice suppliment.</div></div><hr />

&lt;-- has definatley pulled an extra set of mobs once or twice with liberal use of the Starfall.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only danger is unpredictable mob pulls.  My rule of thumb is that if all mobs within sight are already pulled, pop that badboy.  If there's a group  on the other side of the room or whatnot, that you don't want pulled prematurely, don't.<br />
<br />
I even use it in some of the longer single target boss fights - why not... Its an instant cast, and is not channelled, so there's really no downside to popping it whenever possible (unless mana conservation is an issue, but I never go oom, so no biggie).  <br />
<br />
But yeah... lol... starfall and hurricane goin at the same time on a crowd of 20 mobs in naxx is pure sickness (especially if you've specced gale winds which I also highly recommend)</div></div><hr />

<br />
much like the treants, its yet another thing that takes very little time to pop off, and keeps dealing out dmg for a while,  as you continue with your base rotation<br />
<br />
The hardest part for me (same with treants) was training my brain to NOT FORGET to use it when available/applicable.  haha   I saw a major bump in my overall DPS from simply forcing myself to remember those little bonus attacks.   Now I'm constantly lookin down to to see if their off CD      <br />
