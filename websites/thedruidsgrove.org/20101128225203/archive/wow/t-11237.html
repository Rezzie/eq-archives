Would TUF be an upgrade from doomulus prime in cat or not?<br />
if yes would it be worth the 125g?<br />
<br />
Also what will hapen to it when BC comes along, will you get an automatic upgrade when you hit 70 or not, as i heard that there would be a TUF2 as reward</div></div><hr />

Way too pricey.  I do like doomulus prime, I still have mine in the bank, but I generally stick to 2 weapons for feral... warden staff for bear, bonecrusher for cat.  Bonecrusher's that mace with 30 str and a crit chance you get from that DM quest.  So... free, and nice.   :)  I added 25 agi to it and I love it for DPSing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-02-2006, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about the TuF.  A lot of druids on my server have it, though I haven't bought it yet.  Its a REALLY nice mace for sure.. though I'm not sure if spending the 125 or so gold on it with BC on the horizon is worthwhile.  Haven't heard of anything about a TuF2.<br />
<br />
I use Bonecrusher too Khar.  30str, 1%crit.  really nice for grinding and pure dps.  I use it like 3/4 of the time I'm in feral form.  Considering throwing a 15str on it.  One of the best weapons, especially considering its free from a relativley easy DM quest.<br />
<br />
The Doomulus Prime is really nice cause it has the 22sta and 1% hit on it, so if you are dps'ing mobs higher than lv 60 with an aoe attack, Doomulus may be better for overall dps (0 dps if you miss / get blocked / parried) and survivability, not sure though.  <br />
<br />
I keep my warden staff on one of my action bars so that I can just click on it to equip it when / if I need to drop into bear form.  Definitley a weapon you should pick up and put 25agi on. :)</div></div><hr />

Would only have used it in cat form, using the wardenstaf already in bear<br />
<br />
think i wait for bc to come out then or for the fisterminator to drop in zg:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">11-03-2006, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a relatively easy boost of str and sta. I would suggest the Fist of Omokk. Its 29str 12sta and it has dropped from Highlord Omokk in LBRS all 6 times I've been to him. I equipped at 55 and still haven't moved to another...simply because I don't have the time to invest in the rep grind and the other maces are really not that much better for the effort. Plus its one of the coolest looking maces in the game. Check it out, I'm pleased with the boost in feral.</div></div><hr />

Still waiting on that damn fish terminator...A couple new warriors are saying theyd roll on it &gt;_&lt; Luckilly half the guild knows better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhroam</div><div class="date">11-03-2006, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with Claritondeus on feral weapons: Bonecrusher is easily obtained from 1 DM-W run.  30str and 1% to crit is great for cat form... and the warden staff/unyielding maul is the obvious choice for bear.<br />
<br />
I've been killing the fish boss for the fish terminator too... damn thing never drops.  Alla has it at a 2% drop rate, so I guess I've many more kills to go before it drops.<br />
<br />
Oh, Claritondeus, the mod Outfitter has special event driven outfits for our forms.  I have my bonecrusher in my cat form outfit and my warden staff as my bear form outfit.  So no matter what outfit I'm in, if I swap into bear, I'm holding my warden staff.  No need to use up a precious action bar slot for it.<br />
<br />
I try not to think of the Mace of Unending Dreams... I'm like 2000/12000 into honored... no way I'm hitting exalted any time soon.  It's  soooo droolworthy though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">11-03-2006, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oooh nice.  We've been killing the fish dude twice a week for a while now, but he's yet to drop either of his phat lewts I want ;_;  I know one of our rogues and I will be fighting over the eyepatch... he's one of those rogues that insists on all obscure AP/sta gear, even though most rogues I know are happy with getting their tier 1/2 sets and their shiny weapons, passing high armor/sta leather to me.   We'll see if I get it if it ever drops.  :(  I'm hoping for the fishing pole too, that thing's just awesome.  A few of our warriors have joked about wanting it, but I'm pretty sure the officers will make that a feral druid item first, since it is a staff, and there's 29372292 decent axes and other junk out there for them. &lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Now that it's getting pushed back to who knows when, I've re-doubled my efforts for exalted CC rep.I have a bit more work than you guys though, about 19k to go =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghortje</div><div class="date">11-03-2006, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">only other viable option for me is the mace of unending life, but i am far from having the rep for that:(<br />
the rest is out of my reach<br />
only 24.000 rep to go:)<br />
lets see what i get first:) exalted or the terminator</div></div><hr />

The fish terminator doesnt even come close to matching the attack power gained from the mace. Plus, the 3 set bonus just owns.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">11-04-2006, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get your guild to do lots of AQ20 runs. You'll get the rep pretty fast, *and* you'll have chances of getting stuff like boots of the vanguard, soutwind helm (which beasts the eyepatch imo), etc. :)<br />
<br />
On my realm, there are even quite a few successfull pugs to AQ20, so it might be worth trying to arrange some of those if you're not in a guild that does AQ20 frequently. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i use the Draconic Maul or Hammer of Bestial Fury in kitty form.<br />
<br />
for bear tanking i've got The Unyielding Maul, +250AC with 12 Sta.  Thrown a +25 agi on to :)<br />
<br />
its free as well from a DM Trib.  Warden Staff is barely any better and still seem to cost dumb money at list on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nos</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, since procs working in forms has been confirmed in the beta, I would think TUF would be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, now that proc's work in cat form (chance to stun with a 1.o attack speed!!!)  I'd say that TuF with Crusader is looking DOMINANT for druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, even with the proc in feral forms, I don't think TUF will be better than a good feral AP weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I don't know.  Haven't played with it yet :cool: But from what I've heard, the stun procs ALL the time with a 1.0 attack speed, which just ruins casters.  Though against mobs / players with more armor, higher AP would probably be desirable.</div></div><hr />

TUF = The Unstoppable Force (AV Exalted 2 Handed Mace)</div></div><hr />
