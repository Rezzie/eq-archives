If I read one more really good thread that just gets trainwrecked with &quot;no healbot lolz!!!111!!eleventyone&quot; posts I'm going to cry. I became a druid to heal first and also be able to do other things. I understand that not everyone feels that way. But I think everyone has chimed in at least once or twice about not wanting to be a &quot;healbot&quot;, there are now valid options to take other than healing only spec. Can't people let it rest already. At the very least can people quit ruining the flow of intelligent conversations with yet another unrelated post about not wanting to heal. YOU DON'T HAVE TO!!!<br />
<br />
Ok. Rant off. Thanks for listening.<br />

What I like about this community is that everyone says play how you want to play and we give helpful advice/comments.  I personally believe that Blizzard made each class with 3 different talent trees for a reason...for each person to tailor their toon to their own playing style.<br />
<br />
I personally prefer to play a Feral druid right now because it is what is fun for me.  But I don't just do that.  What I like about the druid is that we are so versatile.</div></div><hr />

I'm a damn good healer, and can keep anyone up, and really enjoy doing so. However, I find it insulting when people call me healbot, and tell me to &quot;learn2healnoob&quot; when I tell them I'm feral.  I remember a while back in a Mara PuG, I was flying to desolace, listening to some d'bag in the group talking about how druids suck as healers, and that we needed a priest.  I shrugged this off, assuming I was going to show him just how good we can be.  Then he started calling me healbot, saying that I better not try to do anything but heal cause I was gonna have a hard enough time doing that anyway, yadda yadda yadda.  I got pissed, and after exchanging a few words with said individual about being nice / not calling healers healbots, as they often find it insulting, I left the group.  Long story short, they all left the group, and sent me tells saying they were restarting a new group without him, and that they would love to have me come heal for them.  They were nice, and it was a great PuG experience.<br />
<br />
I can see druids getting pissed about healing players who leeroy and complain, or about players who assume that druids sole purpose in the game is to heal.  Just a kind word, and maybe a &quot;you are doing a great job healing.&quot;  or &quot;Thanks for healing us&quot;, and you will have a druid healer friend for life.  This is coming from someone who plays a druid and priest, and get it from both ends, so to speak. :hit:  :eek:</div></div><hr />

I try and let things like that go as long as I can....and then when I can't take anymore I give a warning.  If they still don't listen...then they take things into their own hands.  I do the best I can....and if they do something stupid then it's their fault not mine.  That's why I now have a macro for when I get low on mana.  It basically says &quot;Low on mana.  Don't do anything stupid&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry.  I've noticed that alot of players in the post-60 world are more courteous.  Not all, but more than there were before.</div></div><hr />

About half way through I started getting the supportive comments about my healing and felt much more comfortable and had a good time.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't be ashamed to play our game our way, but it felt nice to prove I can do other roles well too.  (I ended up main Tanking Archaedas in Moonkin form)</div></div><hr />

I was main healer in a Mara PuG, and we were doing just fine.  On Landslide I got aggro, and had to drop into bear form.  People saw the LoTP icon pop up, and all simeltaneously asked me &quot;YOURE FERAL SPECCD :O ??!&quot;  I smiled, said ya, then kept healing.  We cleared all of purp (and we were all pretty low lvls for the instance).  At the end a couple of them told me that I healed better than a lot of priests they had run with.  Talk about making a druid feel good about themselves :)<br />
<br />
Later in the day I got in a 4man group and MT'd the whole instance.  That was a good day.</div></div><hr />

Right now I'm lvl 33 feral spec'ed (have another 42 resto druid on another server) but most of my gear is &quot;x of the Eagle&quot; so I get +stam and +int. I'm finding that this is giving me the greatest flexibility. I can be 'support offensive' with Prowl, Feline Swiftness, Feral Charge, Imp Bash (lol Ghetto Fade - I love that!), Faerie Fire, Root or even Travel Form to get to the front lines quicker. Or I can be supportive healer or flag carrier support with my increased mana from the gear. My WSG friends have even asked me to lvl a little quicker so that I can be their flag carrier.<br />
<br />
My long winded point is... the group of people that I play with are great and don't expect me to be the heal-bot; they expect me to be able to adapt to any situation just like only a druid can.</div></div><hr />

As soon as its announced a warrior chimes in....&quot;why is a feral druid bidding on healer gear?&quot;.....I didnt have to say a word because about 6 other people in the raid, including the other three druids, jumped all over his ass and told him how I heal all the time on raids and that I do a great job. It did my heart good.<br />
