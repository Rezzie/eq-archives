<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klath</div><div class="date">11-21-2006, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm trying to get the Runic Ivory (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3891) task from Wraithguard Thentil Strongarm (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=22497) but he won't seem to give me the option for it.  When I look at my quest log it says I've already completed the quest (Runic Ivory -- Completion Thu Oct 12 23:42:49 2006).   Although I don't recall doing it it's likely that I did (I have no shortage of tusks).  In any case, I haven't killed anything on the Wraithguard faction and Thentil Strongarm cons dubious.  Also, my research suggests that the quest is repeatable. Have the faction requirements for the task changed?  If not, does anyone have any ideas why I can no longer get the task?</div></div><hr />

What level are you ?</div></div><hr />

I'm 75 but I might have been as low as 70 when I completed it earlier.   I wonder if they've added a restriction to limit it to 71-74 or something like that.  I really wish I could get the task as I have a lot of bank space dedicated to storing tusks.  :)</div></div><hr />

Posted by DeMorgoth in this thread: (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Quests&amp;message.id=5518)<br />
&quot;The tasks are in 'sets'. Once you complete all of a 'set', you get a character flag and are able to repeat any task in that set as often as you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounds plausible -- I guess I have to finish the other quest he gave me before I can clear the tusks out of the bank.  It would be nice if it were  possible to do the &quot;Armor Supplies (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3665)&quot; task twice but I suspect that one probably wouldn't be offered again.</div></div><hr />

At Level 71 and conning dubious, I got either &quot;I do not have anything for one of your abilities&quot; or &quot;I don't trust you enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
I suppose to improve faction I would have to be killing in F.C, as I can't think of any other way to improve faction or gain levels heh.</div></div><hr />
