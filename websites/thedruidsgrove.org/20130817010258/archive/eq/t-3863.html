<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tweil</div><div class="date">07-15-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the list we are sending on to VI.<br />
<br />
Caster Balancing <br />
&lt;blockquote&gt; <br />
Can you give us an update on caster and/or priest balancing? <br />
<br />
Do you feel that there are or will be opportunities for generalist classes, like druids, to successfully compete with specialist classes for raid spots in the high-end game?<br />
<br />
Regarding class AA, at this time are there any plans to adjust class AA abilities?&lt;/blockquote&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid-Specific<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
What role do you see a druid fulfilling in a six-man group or on raids? <br />
<br />
Are there any plans to give druids ports to Luclin? <br />
<br />
Do you ever plan on making the druid rings in Greater Faydark, Lesser Faydark, and Ocean of Tears active? <br />
<br />
Any thoughts on any new druid spells that would bring some balance and value to the class in the endgame? <br />
<br />
What percentage of all characters do druids make up at levels 1-20, 21-40, 41-50, 51-55, 56-59 and 60? How does this compare to the percentage of druids in high-end guilds? <br />
<br />
Druid pets (BooBoo, charmed, and dire-charm pets) can be buffed by their master, but not by anyone else. This has not always been the case: prior to Luclin, druid pets were buffable. Would you consider changing this so that druids are no longer a &quot;familiar&quot; class like clerics and wizards? The tagging of creatures as animals was improved recently, but there are still a few places (like Cazic Thule) where things that look like animals aren't. Are there any plans to, say, tag all raptors as animals? <br />
<br />
Why aren't there more druid-friendly soloing areas? <br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
When are you going to fix the broken Crest of the Fauns subquest of the Tunarean Signet Ring Quest?<br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items <br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
Are you planning on revisiting focus items before PoP's release? <br />
<br />
Will we see focus effects added to Kael- and Skyshrine-type quest armor? If so, when? <br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
General EQ <br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
How do you plan to improve lines of communication with the player base in the future? <br />
<br />
Well-equipped high-level characters face little risk in dungeons with low blue mobs. However, they still pick up a decent amount of experience and loot. Are there any plans to encourage level 60 players to move out of Upper Sebilis and Velketor's Labyrinth in terms of experience gain? Any plans to introduce more factors than just mob level and zone xp modifier when calculating xp? <br />
<br />
How do you balance the need to deliver new content with the desire of players to see fixed existing content such as quests, the Bazaar, and so on? <br />
<br />
How do you feel about competing with yourself with Star Wars Galaxies soon to hit the market? Do you expect that players will want to play both? Will there be any package deals for both? <br />
<br />
<br />
Will you have anything to say about Manaburn or Ragefire? Those have done more harm to interguild relationships than anything else in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
When will the Jaggedpine zone be offered to all servers?<br />
&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Planes of Power <br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
Can you give us a teaser about what you plan on doing with new skills in PoP? <br />
<br />
What role will druids be playing in PoP? <br />
<br />
What new content can the druid class expect to see in PoP? <br />
<br />
After increased level limits with Kunark, quest armor with Velious, and Alternate Advancement with Luclin, what's next for druids in particular? <br />
<br />
With PoP, will we get any new blue servers?&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are there any plans to have items that when placed in General Inventory Slots add stats, like charms in Diablo 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliza</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will we see focus effects added to Kael- and Skyshrine-type quest armor? If so, when?<br />
<br />
It was my understanding that items with right click effects (such as epics) were not eligible for focus effects because of coding problems.  Something about not being able to code both a focus effect and a right click or proc effect. <br />
<br />
  Do you ever plan on making the druid rings in Greater Faydark, Lesser Faydark, and Ocean of Tears active? <br />
<br />
Think they've already stated those were added only for the looks and would not be making any more old world port spots.  You never know though, that was before they added the Surefall Glade portal ;)  <br />
<br />
The rest looks great and I can't wait to see how VI responds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tweil</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sent the list off last night.  Hopefully we will hear within the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrun</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont know where my original post went for this thread.. maybe I accidently put it in another thread...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I like this list and think it is much better then the petition we sent.. short and sweet.  One of the reasons I think the petition was ill received was its long windedness and lack of a quick point.<br />
<br />
Well done Tweil.. hopefully Verant rewards this conciseness with at least some answers or timely acknowledgement.  I doubt we will get all the questions answered but all of them are definately valid questions.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YanguBoris</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alliza, not all of our class armor has effects. Vambraces, Circlet, and Gauntlets come to mind.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to here the answers Tweil. Keeping us informed is one of the best things they can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ntropy Reverser</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I would like to ask is if there may be an upgraded version of our Plant Charm spell, or possibly even have it added to our AA Dire Charm ability?  The low level version we have of Charm Plant, is well, suck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">07-16-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a little late but I was wondering if some more focus questions could be asked?<br />
<br />
1.  Why dont group buffs work with focus items like the 8th shawl that extend buff time?<br />
<br />
2.  Do Improved Healing 3 and Healing Adept AA skill work together?   From preliminary tests, it seems that the same critical heals can be obtained by those with just Improved Healing 3 as those who also have Healing Adept in addition to IH3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tweil</div><div class="date">07-19-2002, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to give an update.  The email was sent Monday and I have had no answer yet.  Not even a &quot;We have your email you silly little druid, no go away while we get you the answers&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firemynd</div><div class="date">07-24-2002, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who's read many of my posts will know I'm far from being a VAK, but I'm usually realistic and ... usually sitting in the PvV camp. :P However, I have to make an exception in VI's defense, before people start ranting &quot;it's been a week and NADA!!&quot; ....<br />
<br />
It's very likely that the person answering Tweil's letter won't actually be responding to every question personally. LOT of questions on that list, covering several aspects of the game. Heck, even if he could answer them all personally, he'd obviously still want to consult with various other staffmembers before sending a reply, and most of the those folks have been busy over the past week preparing for today's patch. <br />
<br />
No doubt he also realizes that whatever he sends back to Tweil will become a living breathing press release. ;) <br />
<br />
Now that the patch is done, many of the coders and designers will have a short breather -- at least until the inevitable emergency patch to patch whatever gets screwed up with the initial patch. During their break, hopefully they'll find some time to trudge through what they will probably be referring to as - &quot;that @%$# druid list.&quot;<br />
