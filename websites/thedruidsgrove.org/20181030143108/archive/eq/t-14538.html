<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merci</div><div class="date">10-04-2006, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm assuming there will be a specific order the spells are issued when you turn in the Glowing Obsidian Runes like there was in OoW.  I turned in one last week and the spell was Cloudburst Hail Rk. III DRU (71).<br />
<br />
Anyone else have any info on turn ins?  Would love to see a list of the order, especially how far down the list is group Direwild and our heals.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Going to list them up here in order as others post.<br />
<br />
 1.  Cloudburst Hail (71)<br />
 2.  Mammoth's Strength (71)<br />
 3.  Pure Life (72)<br />
 4.  Cure Corruption (71)<br />
 5.  Swarm of Fireants (73)<br />
 6.  Winter's Flame (73)<br />
 7.  Resist Corruption (73)<br />
 8.  Tectonic Quake (74)<br />
 9.  Equinox Burn (74)<br />
10.  Chant of Napaea (74)<br />
11.  Adrenaline Surge (75)<br />
12.  Blessing of the Direwild (75)<br />
13.  Rime Crystals (75)<br />
<br />
And that completes the druid list per Prathun's post mentioned below in this thread.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Swapped Adrenaline Surge and Chant of Napaea to correct order, confirmed by turn ins.</div></div><hr />

Lucy's and other sites have pulled info for all of our Rank III spells, none are missing info as to higher mana cost, higher effects, etc.  So SOE put all the Rank III spells in the data files as red herrings?  a prank?  I don't think Prathun would come post that though if it wasn't true, but leaves me disgruntled after all the misinformation.<br />
<br />
I hope the 13th spell is Second Life... that spell has saved my butt more times than I can count, even allowing me to camp out during raid wipes.  <br />

The part from Prathun for those who don't want to read through 4 pages, after he dropped hints that everyone's speculation about Rank III spells was not quite right:<br />

Despite its better judgment, my calculator started talking with me again and we chatted over a candlelit dinner about Rank III spells.  As the night wore on and our inhibitions loosened, the discussion really heated up.  If you're easily offended you might want to stop reading right here and now.  This is going to get juicy.<br />
 <br />
&quot;So just to sum up&quot;, I explained, dabbing at the corners of my mouth with my napkin, &quot;If you clear Frostcrypt and Ashengate once a week, every week, like clockwork - every member of a 70 member guild will have their runes in less than 5 months.  If you clear the entire expansion once a week, every week, like clockwork - every member of the same 70 member guild will have their runes in less than 4 months.  It can be a little shorter or faster than this, depending on the guild's class makeup, and rolls of the random number generator, but there you have it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Four months?  That is a far cry from the years that some folks have estimated!&quot;, my calculator blurted out, incredulously, as I indicated to the waiter that we needed another round of drinks.<br />
&quot;Yes, but that's because there's something I know that they don't.&quot;<br />
&quot;But Prathun&quot;, the calculator leaned in close, its LCD face changing to form a somber expression, &quot;Why can't you be honest with them?&quot;<br />
&quot;I like a little mystery, frankly.  Explaining the details takes all the fun out of it.  Can't you appreciate that?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, frankly,&quot; the calculator fired back, clearly annoyed by my response, &quot;I like a little directness.&quot;<br />
&quot;That outfit you're wearing is hideous.&quot;<br />
&quot;Be serious!&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, fine,&quot; I balled up my napkin and threw it down, &quot;There are only about half the Rank III spells available from rune turn-ins.  8 for hybrids, 13 for casters and priests, and 3 for melee.&quot;<br />
&quot;And the rest of the spells?&quot;<br />
&quot;For all intents and purposes, they don't exist.  They're not available anywhere in game.&quot;<br />
&quot;You really should tell them.  Stop and think about what would happen if a melee looted a 4th rune.  Did you ever think about that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're right.  I'll tell them.&quot;<br />
&quot;And what about her?  Are you ever going to tell her about us?&quot;<br />
&quot;No.  She doesn't need to know.&quot;</div></div><hr />

SOE? ROFL, we're talking about Prathun here. Moving Prathun to spells was the equivalent of hiring a man as a surrogate mother.<br />
 <br />
He got &quot;promoted&quot; to spells cause he wasn't exactly making people happy in his last position. Just ask any monk or rogue.</div></div><hr />

Maybe this is the explanation of the crappy spells everyone got.<br />
<br />
True, a few are good, for example clerics are happy over the new promise spell.<br />
<br />
But overall, I found the 71-75 druid spells crappy.  Second life is nice, though.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started over the fact that with focus items, the 71-75 spells are actually worse than the 65-70 ones.  I guess I have to wait a year until I get all new high level focus items to make it worth using the new spells.<br />
<br />
Everyone is still waiting for some word on the spells that got cut after all the beta work that was done on them.<br />
<br />
And yes, I always bitch about everything, you can't make me happy :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still cast mammoth quite a bit...not every group I am in has a shammy to cast foresight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merci</div><div class="date">11-07-2006, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as raids go though, I never cast Mammoth... actually, I did once for the MT only because all shaman were dead :p... and that was it.  Single groups, yes, I use it more often when no shaman is around.  <br />
<br />
So for that reason I would have preferred to get a Rank III that's used all the time instead of Mammoth Strength which is never used when a shaman is present.<br />
<br />
And if we think that's a bad choice for a Rank III spell, clerics get Cure Corruption as their 6th spell in, and then get Expunge Corruption as their 9th spell in.  Expunge is their better corruption cure removing more counters, both are single target.  Figure out the logic behind that one...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the only reason why lions was cast more than might in the past was because shamans already had to keep 3 buffs on everyone plus champion.  It was a lot more efficient to have druids (a class which casts fewer buffs) keep lions covered, but nowadays mammoth's auto casts from a staple shaman buff.  Opening up another spell gem for me is something I definaly am not complaining about, though =D.<br />
<br />
As far as our turnin order...<br />
<br />
I could do without rk. 3 Resist Corruption and Tectonic quake.  Adren surge rk.3 is meh, since the best part of the spell (over other heals) is the vie effect, which doesn't improve within higher ranks.  Winter's Flame is another one that is so so.<br />
<br />
rk. 3 Spells I'ld like to see (in no paticular order)...<br />
<br />
2nd life, single dire, and icefall breath (more % dmg mod nice for raids.)  Skin to vines rk.3 would be awesome if it actually landed on raid mobs.  Beast Beckon's rk.3 would be nice since this gains a more benefit on rank 3 than most spells, but it's a very situational ability (ie, useless for raids.)</div></div><hr />
