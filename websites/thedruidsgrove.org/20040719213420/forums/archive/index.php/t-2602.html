<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyezenia Planar Druid Extadinaire</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is the worth of MGB to a druid? Yes I am in a &quot;raiding guild&quot; and such, but I lack aas and ponder the true significance of it. I mean what is the true value? I've looked to other requirements for other guilds (comparison to pan out an aa plan that is significant). Something I know what I want, but what is the true value of it. Were can be it of use? Personally the only thing I can think of doing with it is mgbing PoS. Although the mana usage with other druids is insignicant (normally 2-3 per raid). Basically what I am asking is what are other buffs that are used, is there any sort of aa combinations, and other unforseen benefits? I've heard of using sotw and gunning it with mgb, that ever become usefull or is it just something useless? Is it worth it and if so how do you fully use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I WISH more druids in our guild had MGB. So far there's only 2 - me and 1 other who doesn't raid much. It's very annoying. MGB druids can be very useful on raids.<br />
<br />
MGB Botn (this is the biggy)<br />
MGB Sotw chains (why why why don't more druids have this with mgb)<br />
MGB PoS<br />
MGB Blessing of replenishment<br />
or even MGB FoE (yes, I've found times when that has been useful)<br />
<br />
Also, it's not about mana preservation - it's about TIME. 10 mins buffing everyone vs 5 seconds buffing everyone.  Of course you can go down a raid list and buff every group on a raid with PoS without spending much mana, but you slow everyone down. The convenience of mgb is worth the aa's imo for every buffing class. It also takes a load off the raid leaders mind - 1 call for buffs and bam, everyone's buffed with botn, kazads, fo7, bss, vq, regen, haste, whatever. Couple mins to med after that and you're good to go.<br />
<br />
Btw, about mgb sotw chains, it is very useful and it stacks with mgb EE. You just have to remind everyone to have 2 buff slots open.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  I rarely use it for that.  With bardsong and a modrod I can just Bot9 every group in the raid in 10 or 15 minutes and save MBG for SotW.  Paladins don't want it at all anyway and clerics don't really care with their own buffs and if their STA isn't maxed they can get infusion of spirit since they don't have focus, so often we just MGB Virtue and Pot9 a couple wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its worth getting at some point.  When really depends on the level of your raiding guild and its makeup.  Not until your druids have Bot9 will you be using it to do much buffing, since marzin's mark is still rare, I assume nobody much does glades/marzin anymore.<br />
<br />
But having mgb combined with sotw is invaluable and can save a raid.  Totally totally worth getting just for that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-24-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Bot9 and I find myself saving MGB for spirit of the wood most of the time anyway...I hate blowing MGB on a timesaver when there's a chance (even if remote) of a mass spirit of the wood saving a raid.  (I think I'm the only druid left in my guild that can MGB spirit of the wood...there might be one other, I'd have to check.)  I guess it depends on the size of the raid though, most of mine have only 4 to 6 groups, so it doesn't take a lot of extra mana to just cast on groups.<br />
<br />
Marzin's mark might be rare, but kazad's mark isn't all that rare (just a spectral spell).  I know several clerics that went straight from naltron's mark to kazad's mark.</div></div><hr />

It was during a Grummus raid with another guild (XA) that I was impressed (and saved) by the SoTW MGB chain the other guild utilized.<br />
<br />
During boring farming raids, I goof off with MGB on other buffs just to keep it fun. &quot;Look, I can floaty sow a whole raid now!&quot; :) <br />

<br />
The whole point of MGB is so you don't have to waste 15 mins doing it.  As far as MGB SoTW, its really only good in AE encounters and you still get a group sotw to toss on the MT and RT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwynet Woodsister</div><div class="date">04-27-2003, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I waited to get BoTN to get MGB. Without it I'm not sure it's really worth it, the fights where MGB SoW is useful are not that common. And even if I have found uses for mgb BoR and FoE (I don't bother with Seasons really) I don't think it's worth getting MGB just for those.<br />
<br />
The only times we do mgb virtue now is when no druid has mgb up. I know that personally I will take PoTN over virtue anytime even if I lose hitpoints (and I am a HP freak). The 120 HPs and 8mana/HP regen are well worth the difference IMO (and for all classes). Also, you don't have to refresh PoTNs and symbols everytime, because PoTN will not overwrite buffs of people who don't want it.<br />
<br />
Now, if you should get it depends on your guild and your clerics I guess. If they will keep doing mgb virtue then it's prolly better to spend those points somewhere else. But I personally don't regret the 9 points I spent on it, and I don't spend lots of time exping.</div></div><hr />

Doing 10-12 groups with single group buffs sucks the wazoo.  My mana pool will support single target buffing 4 groups easily, and theres no way I'd want to hold up 60 people to do 10 groups.  Nor would the guild leaders tolerate it.<br />
<br />
When we don't have enough druids to do the MGB/SoTW chain, we have a cleric do MGB/Supernal Elixer I think it is.<br />
<br />
MGB/SoTW isn't so much a defining skill for a druid, as a &quot;new tactic&quot; that emerged with POP.<br />
<br />
As a rule, we save our MGB's for the MGB/SoTW chain though.  Unless its called for we never AE seasons or FOE.<br />
<br />
Some pop events though where time is critical, we do AE every buff.</div></div><hr />

I stopped after having it bounce off 75% of the folks (too many lazy casters).   So now I just group or single cast Nines on people on request (and often that request is from a cleric).    I save MGB for SotW, which with max duration is really nice.</div></div><hr />

As somone said, MGB Nines, Symbol, VoQ, Focus, etc and everyone is buffed sufficiently for the raid to move forward quickly.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, for the fast but deadly AE kills, I have saved MGB for the Woody chain.  When we did it on Grummus, that showed, once and for all, the value of MGB Woody.  More often than not, MGB HoV works fine for these fights.<br />
<br />
So, in response to your question, I've found MGB to be very valuable and my guild appreciates every AA I put into it.  :p   I make sure of that!  *grin*</div></div><hr />

Buff focus (ex. Zephyr of Brell) will stack with SCRM as well.  I'm not aware of any 30% focuses but Zephyr + SCRM will make your buffs last 70% longer.<br />

Increase Hitpoints v2 by 250 per tick<br />
Icrease Damage Shield by 55<br />
Increase AC by 48<br />

Now I use it on pretty much every raid. If I'm not MGB-ing B9 then I'm MGB-ing SotW during the fight.<br />
<br />
We now have several MGB+SotW druids in my Guild, and a couple of MGB+Elixir clerics, and you really notice the difference against AE mobs I can tell you :) <br />

If you raid, it's worth getting MGB.<br />

<br />
According to lucy, the AA heal over time they get has been doubled in length and changed to a group heal.  At level 3 that's 800/tick for 8 ticks (just long enough to be affected by the normal extended enhancement focus items too), so with SCR3/SCRM/extended enhancement that's 13-14 ticks.<br />
<br />
If it goes live, it might make a number of encounters significantly easier...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's probably more appropriate, as a single target regen I don't think it was all that useful, and 800/tick for the group (or full raid if MGB'd) was too much.</div></div><hr />

Notice that Word of Replenishment is Group v2.  That's still not MGBable, right?<br />
<br />
Also, before the change to make all illusion spells not tgbable, Share Wolf Form wasn't tgb/mgbable because it was &quot;Beneficial, Group only&quot;.  Share Form of the Great Wolf worked because it was just &quot;Beneficial&quot;.  Is that what you're thinking of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Litigo13</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To give you soem insight into Spirit of the wood and MGB. I got lvl 3 SOTW because I powerlevel ALOT. I could cast replenishment on myself, natures renweal, brackencoat, and shield of bracken, pull about 25 lvl 40-45 mobs, cast aoe debuff on them twice, and pop wood, taking my damage shield, (with shamy potions) to over 130, and the mobs woudl shred themselves. the toon to be powerleveled would aoe the mob, or tap each one with a weapon, and get the exp for 25 red mobs at once. Used every 20 minutes in addition to regular DS powerleveling, it was a noticable improvement, and I was happy. Then I got MGB. The first time I used it on a Sontalak raid, I knew it was a BIG improvement over my pre MGB/sotw raid contributions. To give you an idea of how large an improvement we are talking about, we went from losing 6-8 people on a sont kill, to losing none. And I mean none, ever, to the AOE, since I got the ability, on any Sont raid I've been on. It makes that much of a difference. For mobs like Theris Thule, you pop that aoe wood when the butterflies spawn, and a. noone dies, and b. the butterflies shred themselves on a raid wide 100+ damage shield. <br />
There just isn't anything else that I can do during a raid, that is anywhere near as valuable as MGBing 40-60 people and trivializing an AOE. It is like asking, how hard would (pick the dragon of your choice, sans sleeper) be without an AOE?<br />
We use a 3 part chain on any aoe mob, one MGB wood, then an MGB Paragon, then another MGB wood. Once you have experienced what an MGB Wood/paragon chain can do, you will be astounded. <br />

If it helps, think of it as raid quissence</div></div><hr />
