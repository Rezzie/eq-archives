I need to know  good place to solo for exp.<br />
I was thinking the dwarfs in BB but I dont want to lower factioin i spent 19 lvls to become allies with them. any soloing area ideas would be very much appeaciated! All i need to do is get to 34 then i can take HG!</div></div><hr />

Just watch for Redwind, but with Harmony, you can pull the orcs from around him if you're careful.<br />
<br />
Frontier Mountains should be good at 30 too.  I think you can kill some stuff in Iceclad at 30 (cougars maybe).  Check the Tizmak caves in GD as well.  They are rarely camped and they might be in that range.<br />
<br />
30 is a bit low solo, but if you had a partner, you could do Orcs in Crystal Caverns.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, its generally fairly easy to get a group somewhere like OT at 30, which can also be fun, easy, and easy to depart when you must.</div></div><hr />

Root/dot works pretty well and i was able to make almost enough cash from the ulthorks to pay for c3.  34 is the magic number though...after that you can quad snow cougars and dire wolves in iceclad and get to 43 rapidly.</div></div><hr />

When that slows down I did rot/rotted snow cougars in Iceclad until 34 then quadded them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LilWolf</div><div class="date">01-03-2003, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you do the dwarfs in BB right, you only effect about 15 of them (still ally inside and to guards... you can fight them right infront of guards also).<br />
<br />
They are the BEST xp I've seen in the game.  When I was finally able to quad them, I flew through lvls SO quick it was great.  Also made good cash too.<br />
<br />
if you do this (there are great places to find info on them... go look).  I have 2 recommondations.  <br />
<br />
1) buy a cheap weight reducing bag.  Then fill them with the axis.  They are worth selling in BB (but probably not worth porting for).<br />
<br />
2) buy enough charisma gear to get to 110.  Worth it (two opal encrusted steins did it for me for 40pp each)</div></div><hr />
