They are purported to drop off the trash (NOT the bosses) in the 3 Skylance instance missions given out by Ao the Fourth in Arcstone.<br />

Random Rare: Eye of Ice <br />
Random Rare: Vial of the Escaped Genie <br />
Random Rare: Scrykin Farseer's Stone<br />

Anyone have enough experience with killing these mobs to hazard a guest-imate as to how frequently---or, more likely, how very infrequently---they drop?</div></div><hr />

Then again, I've never expected anything to drop, so I may not have checked corpses as closely as I should have.</div></div><hr />

That's kinda what I'm afraid of from talking to people anecdotally. Although I wasn't bothering to check corpses either for awhile, since they never seemed to drop anything.</div></div><hr />

The ae trash in sky 2 seems the best way to get rares if thats all your after.</div></div><hr />

Connected to first basement room are 3 smaller rooms full of stonemites, these stonemites can drop any of the 3 rare items. Druid (with reptile skin) + another PBAE class + any melee class can farm rare drops easily although it may take a while. Just slap reptile skin on melee and have him/her none dmg pull (this is important, these stonemites have very little hp, any dmg to them will result in summoning), then PBAE whole room of stonemites at once. Rinse and repeat for 2 other rooms, if puller grabbed anything other than just stonemites, evac and start over. Once all 3 rooms have been cleared just drop task and get a new one, any Skylance mission works. Takes about 5 minutes per run, great for leveling evolving items too. It took me 20 some odd hours total to get 3 augs to drop, during the time I had 2 eyes and 4? vials rot. It sucks that you can't add anyone to task once task has been received.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 augments in 20 hours of mass killing does seem to support my contention that these items are very rare drops. How many stonemites did you kill in TWENTY hours, using pbaoe? A football stadium full, I would think...</div></div><hr />
