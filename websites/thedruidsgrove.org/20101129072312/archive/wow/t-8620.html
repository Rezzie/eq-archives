So I wonder if you hardcore druidsmen could help me out a little bit with some tips on how to fight against the other classes and how to win.</div></div><hr />

The most important thing ive learnt is to stay in bear form. Cat form in duels seems to be suicide (unless your fully feral specced). Dueling at lvl 23 is very different to dueling at 60, or even at 30 because people have only made a small start on their talent trees and many classes dont get certain skills until later in the game.<br />
<br />
The best advice i can give you at your level is not to worry. Duel for fun, duel to learn, but dont worry if you lose a lot of duels, its just practice.</div></div><hr />

Use Cat against all caster classes. I would suggest caster vs rogues. Beat form against other druids is a must.<br />
<br />
I was able to beat a 30 gnome mage as a 24 druids yesterday in cat form. it is mportant to note though, that all your abilities in cat accept for claw are buigged..... Bear for the win.</div></div><hr />
