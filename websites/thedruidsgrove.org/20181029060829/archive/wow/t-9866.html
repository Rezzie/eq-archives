I wonder what off-hand item I should carry around.  Could feral druid bros and sisters enlighten me?:elfbiggri</div></div><hr />

There's some armor ones out there if you're more of the bear type, the only one that comes to mind is stitches femur.  An easy thing to get for a bit more armor in bear form.  Then you can always just use a caster offhand with their various unique effects/procs.</div></div><hr />

Does it proc in cat form? I know the green whelp armor works in forms, i was think about this, my lowbie druid friend asked me.</div></div><hr />

Another off-hand item I recently got has resists on it. It may be called the Magebane Scion (or maybe that's another reward from the same quest, &quot;Battle of Darrowshire&quot;). I think it has +10 resist to fire, frost and arcane (the three mage trees). Either way, you don't have to pick which reward you get from completing that quest, you actually get all three! I did it for the Ring of Protection (which was 'rebalanced' a while back to increase sta and decrease armor &gt;:P ). Both items work well for bear form, but don't do much for cat form.</div></div><hr />
