<br />
By Bug I mean something not working properly.  This is not a thread to discuss design decisions, claim that spells suck or anything else.  <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
I cast my SoF Fire nuke and I lose half my mana bar.<br />
<br />
That type of post is what I want here, it makes my job relying infomration easier. <br />
<br />
Please, when discribing bugs be as clear and specfic as possible, including what zone you were in, what you were doing / casting, and so forth.<br />

The first is is that shift - or + does not affect far clip plane. I have to alt O into options and manually adjust the slider bar. The second is that when I use my mount lev seems to go away. I still have foe on, and I don't seem to take damage from falling, but I do fall. No bobbing and no staying high over hills or ledges. Besides running around this really sucks for my casting style. Without floaty LoS issues become very, very lame. I am not sure if the no lev with mount thing is just in Steamfont and SoF zones or everywhere.</div></div><hr />

I have noticed the same thing.  Not connected to a mount, tho.  You just seem to sink to the ground.   Old zones have the same problem.   Places that I have always been able to float high above, I now sink and run into things.  Also, running around the zone-edge, along a hill for instance, it is almost like it is forcing you down, instead of up, and you get stuck.</div></div><hr />

Arcstone has issues. My guild was going to take Porthos but we couldn't get there... on porting to Arcstone half the guild fell through the world. I have tried porting twice since then and both times I feel through.</div></div><hr />

It seems tied to the mobs transforming into their &quot;were&quot; form. When fighting the Orcs, there is a small jitter when the mob transforms - this seems to affect the whole zone, not just those close to the Orc. Add a bunch of these together and the screen literally freezes long enough to spin you in the wrong direction or lock you in place long enough for a mob to run you down.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this 100% It is tied to the mobs morphing to their wereorc form. The lag is so bad, it will take me to 2 frames per sec sometimes - just enough time for another mob to by and womp on me!!</div></div><hr />

B - Get rid of this piece of crap spell, and replace it with something useful (ice dot).<br />

And there is a lev bug with mounts. In order to have bouncing lev, you have to cast it after the mount is on. Otherwise you may result in a 200k fall, not always, but it does still happen. I bugged this about 15 times in Beta and now 5 times on live.<br />

Are they ever going to fix the sky bug on the ground? I can't zone in anywhere in SoF zones without having to turn on either 2 shaders or Advanced Lighting... Which makes things fun since that makes me lag some. WTB all the sky bugs fixed plzkthx! :)</div></div><hr />

I suppose I should have read the SOE boards first. This is a solid and intended nerf - supposedly aimed at Pally's, but hit us. That's too bad, Reptile was my favorite heal - now its relegated to the never use pile :mage01:</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) With the new Forage cap increase to 250, the skill mod on the Foraging Machette no longer seems to work. Equipping it only gives 252 total (should be 10% increase). Bug, or previously unused hard cap?<br />
<br />
2) Same as mentioned above, every time i port to Arcstone, i land UNDER the world. Porting in and Succoring doesn't help.<br />
<br />
3) AE Hail-type spells only hit for 1 round. I asked a few other druids i know to try it out and see if they got the same effect. The particular spell is Cloudburst Hail Rk2 (for me, anyway). I can be completely stationary with a cluster of mobs being held by the tank a short distance away and only one round of 1600-ish dmg nukes land.<br />
<br />
Have reported all these via /bug but haven't seen anything happen to fix it.</div></div><hr />

Not a bug, rain nukes will hit one target 3 times, 2 targets twice, 3 or 4 targets once.  If there are more than 4 mobs it will only hit 4 of them.</div></div><hr />
