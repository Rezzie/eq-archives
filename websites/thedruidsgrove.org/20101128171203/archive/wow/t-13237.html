<br />
still only friendly so beginning to work on the dailys and quests in SP.<br />
<br />
question is can you hand in the Relics all the way to exalted or not ?<br />
<br />
wondering if any benefit to handing all of them in as i quest or keep them til higher rep ?<br />
<br />
cheers</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i did always all the dailies for the gold. (and for horde-ganking ;-D)<br />
once on revered u have 6 dailies in that area which are done in about 30 mins = ~100g. Really nice in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
only got 3 dailys atm but still doing normal quests all over SP.<br />
<br />
i'll ease off on the ones from the Vault as exalted now with Knights. but yeah the gold is good for doing them all anyways !</div></div><hr />

GL with &quot;Thrusting Hodir's Spear&quot; :P... you'll have fun learning that one...<br />
<br />
btw, what's up with the homoerotic names for those dailies? &quot;Polishing the Helm&quot;, &quot;Blowing Hodir's Horn&quot; &quot;Thrusting Hodir's Spear&quot; etc etc etc... not that there's anything wrong with that... im just sayin is all...</div></div><hr />

<br />
the spear quest is a bit odd.<br />
<br />
the first part is ok but the 2nd part trying to pry open its mouth is just random luck?</div></div><hr />

<br />
no its not^^<br />
for each time u aply the first spell, your chance to hit rises for 5%.<br />
You also see a debuff on it, which shows how often u hit him with it.<br />
<br />
so try to put 10-15 stacks up and u have 50-75% chance to kill him.<br />
should be no problem cause u are at full health when phase 2 begins.<br />
<br />
a tip for phase 1:<br />
when he attacks, use dodge and right after that, the big damage ability.<br />
cause dodge is on CD when u activate the damage-abililty, but not reverse. (reverse??? dont know what word^^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-26-2009, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm ok ty s3R.<br />
<br />
to me it seemed random. first couple of times i tried the quest i died :(<br />
<br />
i need to keep applying the first one more often then b4 doing the acutal spear/kill him one thats on the bigger CD.<br />
<br />
i'll check out my phase 1 attack plan to :)<br />
<br />
hmm i thought i was at quite a bit less than full health tbh when phase 2 started ?  i even got to a point where i killed him and he got me at the same time !<br />
<br />
still they are some ok quests i guess for variety and they collectively give good rep. it wont take long for Exalted tbh as long as i do all of them each day as a priority.<br />
<br />
its much slower getting AC or Wyrm rep only from dailys :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats because u have a Tabard for those factions.<br />
For Hodir you have quests only :boohoo: .</div></div><hr />

:band: :texla: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah could try that skw. it always looked like i was losing a reasonable amount of HP.....say a third before phase 2.<br />
<br />
although i will say it was easier last night when i was madly spamming the pry open button before using the thrust one !</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the same vein as regrowth etc. try popping Barkskin and NI too.<br />
<br />
But really, just watch your hot keys until Phase 2 and spam 1 until you're at  20. Then instant death.<br />
<br />
The key to phase 1 is dodge and damage. Grip is easy to maintain early on and seems to go much faster if Phase 1 goes too long. None of the abilities are on the GCD so you can hit them whenever they are up. Dodge should be hit EVERY time it comes up. This is how you conserve health. Other than that, 4 after any dodge if it's up otherwise 3 when it's up. Grips in between.<br />
<br />
I really don't even look at my grip and as long as I do enough damage, I'm easily at 75-80% health in phase 2...as a mage! I have like 10k hp's and only my mana shield at the start. Between HoT's, Barkskin, and NI...druids have it made. :gratz01:</div></div><hr />

<br />
U are a little wrong about the dodge part. :D <br />
<br />
U see a massage when the dragon Hits u.<br />
Just use Dodge immediatly when the message comes.<br />
U have about 2 secs to press it before u get really hit.<br />
<br />
If u use dodge everytime on CD, it's luck how often u will get hit.<br />
cause dodge doesnt last long.<br />
And everytime u actually use dodge, do the big damage-spell right afterwards(and only then), cause the dodge CD is triggered when using this spell.<br />
<br />
I'm in phase 2 ALWAYS with 100% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">03-16-2009, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Wrong&quot; is a bit harsh I think. :moon: <br />
<br />
This is just how I do it. There are many ways to do it. I am pretty much at 100% health in phase 2. The plus to this system is that you don't have to think. You don't have to react. You just look at those 4 buttons and press them in the order I described. It works flawlessly every time, and considering my *state of mind* this is a good system for some :smoke: <br />
<br />
Not to mention I tried this last night with your comments in mind, and let's just say those damn words were on my screen non-stop.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, what ever floats your boat. Just felt like sharing because I fly a dragon like T.J. Hooker drives a police car!</div></div><hr />
