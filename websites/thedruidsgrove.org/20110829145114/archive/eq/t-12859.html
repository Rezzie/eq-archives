Journal of the Vagabond (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26680) drops in ferubi (supposedly) off of Pxet Vzanki Kzan (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=14206). I've been down there duoing a number of times killing him, but the posts on alla say that there's a caster ikaav version and a melee ixt version. I've only ever spawned the caster version. everytime I've killed it it drops Scaled Leggings of Dark Dreams (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27077).<br />
 <br />
any fountains of knowledge know what version if any drops the charm? neither alla or google sheds any light.</div></div><hr />

Has information..<br />

Most likely to help you is:<br />

Luckily Pxet Vxanki Kzan spawns in the hammermaster room if i remember correctly, its a regular ph type mob, one of the mobs along the back wall of the room as you look in. <br />
  <br />
Is that the one your killing?<br />
<br />
From Alla:<br />
<br />
The fighter spawns in the big room at the far south-east of the zone. It is the same room as Rav Hunter and Zun Muram Votal. I beleive Pxet Elite Brawler spans in that room as well but am not sure as I can't seem to find the map I have been marking all this on. <br />
<br />
The caster spawns in the little room just before the hall that leads to smith. This is in the south west section on your map. Most of the maps, I have seen, have Kzan marked for this room.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
it is indeed the one with the hammermaster.  I know because the white con bitch spawned on me while I was clearing the room.  I got her to 20% before she got real angry and decided one round me with 8 1600 hits.<br />
 <br />
kzan is much easier and mostly casts.  she's spawned in the back left spot to the left of the hidden wall everytime I've seen her.<br />
 <br />
I guess this is as good an answer as I'm gonna get so I'll just keep killing the caster version.  thanks for checkin.</div></div><hr />

I don't really know if I could even handle the melee version anyway, and considering it takes close to an hour to get in that far with 2 toons...<br />
 <br />
the real prob is the bl doesn't even do anything except slow and dps the nameds that summon, cause even their dots break root.  so 95% of the time it's soloing and having to deal with not getting the bl killed too.  I dunno, I might try getting to it again.<br />
 <br />
hell, I might just break down and buy him one of those lame don charms.</div></div><hr />

Yea, we did a pickup Rondo this week and I just got around the temple evading see-invis by hugging walls, pretty sure this wasn't the first time I did this... but I do know that when GoD came out you couldn't possibly do this because there were a lot more see-invis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">12-15-2005, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, like I mentioned it takes me almost an hour to get that far, depending on how many see invis.  if even one sees, I have to kill it and everything that aggros around it.  sometimes if it works out for me to do it, i'll ensnare a mob, drag it off the beaten path, evac and come back with it still snared off in a far corner out of aggro range.</div></div><hr />
