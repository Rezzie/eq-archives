<br />
I'm at a point when I'm not really sure what to get next.  What do you have that you've found especially useful that I haven't purchased yet?<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo.  I'll be getting Channeling Focus 3 once I ping.  After that I don't really have anything planned.<br />

Thanks!<br />

In either case you could benefit from finishing the defensive AAs (avoidance and mitigation lines).</div></div><hr />

Secondary Forty -- reduces mana use for certain spells of your choice. This one is important.<br />
Innate Metabolism -- save food when you are on horse<br />
Run 5 -- run faster (especially indoor zones)<br />
Innate Agility line -- your AGI is not maximized, why not increase it, may help with avoiding melee damage. (I think your STA is almost maximized, if not may consider that line as well).<br />
Silent casting line -- reduce hate from healing<br />
secondary recall -- secondary bind point is nice</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't waste my time with innate agility or innate stamina.<br />
<br />
Silent casting is good as long as you remember to use it; its a click and not a permanant reduction...and its not just for healing, its for everything.</div></div><hr />

I think you are right. For stamina, one AA increases your total hp by 9 which is too little. I don't know the effect of agility but I think it is close to nothing for sure. However isn't it look good on your magelo to have higher stats? smile.</div></div><hr />

It's a matter of marginal returns.  Biggest area of improvement I can see is defensive stuff, but that said it's really up to the individual druid to determine which AAs to get next.</div></div><hr />
