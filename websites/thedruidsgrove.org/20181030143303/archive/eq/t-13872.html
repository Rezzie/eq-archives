A few of us tried the battle for permafrost one. We tried a couple times and are really missing a trick to this one or something. The mobs seem to be way overpowered plus tons and tons of adds. We finally got the first named killed by kiting with low heath aggro. Took alot of deaths by all of us due to the orc and goblin adds. Killed 2 named same way but he only has 2 other giant adds. We then entered perma and killed the first named here by a straight zergfest and once again there were atleast 20 adds all blue con. Just wondering if anyone else has tried this mission.</div></div><hr />
