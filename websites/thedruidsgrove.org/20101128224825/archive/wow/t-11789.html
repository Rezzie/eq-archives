As a druid we have to be prepared to play many roles and I find my bags full of equipment to wear depending on my agenda when playing.<br />
<br />
I find during instances that I have to drop pots or herb just to get some of the loot.  <br />
<br />
Can you guys give some advice on how I can manage this more efficiently?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It's the druid problem :D Gear for everything... I myself try to put as much of my outdated trinkets/rings and stuff in the bank.. I always seem to have old trinkets/tings in my bags.. Try to keep your herbs in the bank and make pots before you go to an instance, this will save some space... Buy big bags to keep in your bank/inventory (16 slots).. <br />
I find the gear issue to be abit simpler these days, as a full feral druid really don't heal that very good (imo) with heal gear, even though, I always have the gear with me :)<br />
<br />
Dont know if this is of much help.. But there really isn't a good answer to this question :D<br />

In a Raid, I've got three sets of gear.  The reality is that when doing an instance, drop everything you won't use in the bank.  You can't afford to leave grey trash lying around that's worth 4g+.  If I don't need it for buffs, or its for a quest I'm not working on, it goes in the bank.  I fill two bags just full of my off set gear, but I like to be able to trade out gear if I suddenly need to swap roles.  However, if I'm coming for melee dps or tanking, I never bring my healing set.  (that is unless I'm raiding...)</div></div><hr />

As far as inventory goes, those 4 18 slot bags are all pretty full all the time. I've got at least 15 different gearsets on Itemrack...alot of it is resist gear since I MT for my guild. Between gear and consumables, I've got about 6-8 slots free before I start something. Would be swell, if I could bank some of it, but my spell dmg gear, and some of my frost resist gear are in the bank at the moment. If I carried that stuff with me, I probably wouldn't have a single spot free.<br />

The new factions haven't helped, have a bunch of quest items now, didn't have any before.</div></div><hr />

1. 24 slot bag for herbs<br />
<br />
Bank; <br />
3 18 slots for items I use less frequent or may use in future, resistance gear etc.<br />
rest of the bank bags all 18 slotters with motes,primals, more herbs, food and all kind of badges and stuff.... I almost cry when I look in bank by the lack of space lol<br />
<br />
I've posted on engineers forum that I'd like to see them be able to make a 26(?) slot [Bank Coffer] Only usable in bank slots.</div></div><hr />

My druid has all 16 slot bags in the bank and 16 slotters in inventory.  I'm lucky if i manage to get my back pack empty leaving 16  slots free and a bank stuffed with items.<br />
<br />
On my new main a BE Protection spec Paladin I keep just as much armor as the druid,   A defense set for tanking,  A few melee &quot;dps&quot; (lol paladin and dps in the same sentence) pieces, a spell damage set, and a healing set.  Also various rings, necklaces and trinkets.  I have recently upgraded my Paladin to 4 x 18 slot bags, a few 18's in the bank and the rest 16s.<br />
<br />
I like the [Bank Coffer] ( [Saftey Deposit Box] maybe? )  idea.</div></div><hr />

it's supposed to look like rain =/<br />
<br />
It might seem like we are the only one's with this problem but I think most classes have the same problem with the exception of pure dps classes (mage/rogue/warlock/hunter). They just have to have their gear and resist gears.<br />
<br />
It'd be great to see Blizzard implement something to help out with  players carrying/storing numerous sets of gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. put in comment &quot;DPS Only&quot;<br />
2. when someone asks you to tank/heal, calmly flip them the bird and be on your way. <br />
<br />
you would be surprised how if you hold out for a little while you can end up with a really decent party, and show off how you can do equal or more DPS then most.<br />
<br />
basically what ill say to all druids. you are what your speced for, if people are letting frikken' shadow priests to DPS these days, a druid can do it to. if a shaman can say &quot;I cant heal at all&quot; so can a druid. and thou I find it ridiculous when i see a paladin DPS, if they can do it, I'm damn well going to out DPS that frikken .... sorry I hate thous fleshy types.. and if paladins arent healing, I hate them to. (they cant hold agro well)</div></div><hr />

Every druid has a natural ability to horde items they may never use. I for one have my full dungeon set 2,tier 2 and oomkin gear in the bank. I will never use that gear again but it is nostalgic.Currently my oomkin gear is fully kitted out with fishing enchants and is now my fishing gear.I have the full heroic FR gear, a full set of arcane gear (that i most likely won't ever use), a set with full + all Resist gear (I do use that sometimes),my bear gear, my cat gear, my resto gear and mount gear. Not to mention the bobbing apples from about 2 years back and a 17 pound catfish (no idea why i still have that).<br />
<br />
And I still have my warden staff!</div></div><hr />

Kept my ZG set for ol' memories, and the fact that once those are tossed I wont be able to get it back, T1/2 is possible ... but rather slim chance I do MC or BWL again<br />
<br />
Think I go bump that eng. post to see if they can make a bank chest ... besides Engeneers complain that they dont have nothing to offer/sell but goofy stuff, but now they had a really neat head piece tho, not to mention Repair Bot - possibly the best raid-'pet' in game!</div></div><hr />
