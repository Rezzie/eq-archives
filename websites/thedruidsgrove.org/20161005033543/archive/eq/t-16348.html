<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lately, I have been watching this new series Monday nights on NBC called Chuck. It is about this computer guy who works at Buy More, basically a fictional version of a Best Buy. Really nerdy kind of guy next door, that ends up with secret information planted into his head from his college roomate who got him kicked out of Stanford, a few years back, took his girlfriend and all that. His college roomie was a secret agent for the CIA. All that information downloaded into his head causes him to flash at interesting times, and ends up being guarded night and day by both CIA and NSA agents.<br />
<br />
I think it is very amusing, but, then I like spy stuff like James Bond, and such. It can be allittle goofy and campy, but, I seem to like it anyways. While, all episodes are largely standalones, so far it does have some recurring themes and ongoing storylines for those who could become &quot;hardcore&quot; viewers. So, I am curious if anyone else is interested in this show? <br />
<br />
I also thought it was rather amusing in tonights episode, when they brought up some older themes of Chuck's roomie Bryce, how he might not have been a total douche for getting Chuck kicked out of Stanford and stealing his girl. The thing I thought was funny is Bryce and Chuck were discussing a text based computer game(a MUD). Bryce brought up he knows this girl playing Everquest,(who would later be the girl in question).  Anyways, I thought it was rather amusing, with some potential viral marketing from Sony, but, anyways(kinda like the movie The New Guy).</div></div><hr />

I was wonder where they'd be going with the story line and liked that they finally seemed to be following a plot line.<br />
<br />
Yeah, the bit about Everquest was funny.  But you know, it was 1999 and everquest would have been pretty new and kind of geeky at the time.  :D</div></div><hr />

I am generally not a huge TV fan, but I sometimes like to get lost in mind numbing sit-coms. I am sorry to have missed last nights episode if they had a mention of EQ - lol.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The thing I like about Chuck, is he seems like such an ordinary guy with a really obnoxious and totally goofed out friend. Hehehehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think his ego was so damaged by the kick that he isn't aspiring for much.  They've kind of hinted at that in past shows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I would have to agree there about Chuck's ego, he is a bright guy, well, when he is staying in the car, which happens never.  But, then, alot of intellectual people also never really live up to their full potential, so, I kinda like that about the show.<br />
<br />
Must agree Morgan rocks! He is always a breath of fresh air with his storylines by himself. I kinda like him with Chuck's sister, Ellie, they have some hilarious scenes. They do very well with character developement on Chuck so far. <br />
<br />
I kinda like all the characters, Sarah, she is interesting, looking forward to more of her backstory, but, I am disappointed in the they haven't been showing her during her fight scenes lately, with her outfits flying around allittle bit, but then, well, I am a guy..... Casey, I love his sarcasm and general kick butt mentality. The take a shower hippie, that was just pure awesome, not to mention the helicopter and chasing down the nerd herd, then, decking the nerd herd out with all kinds of spy toys lol.<br />
<br />
Here is a thing alot of networks are doing lately is making them available online, for FREE! So, shows when I work I can catch up on. So, Chuck is one that is featured. They usually only go with 4 episodes back and are usually available the next morning around 3am or so in the morning, which works for those night shift peeps like me, or just busy and wanna check out the latest episodes. Here is the link.....http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/video/episodes.shtml</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone watch Ugly Betty?  In a similar sort of way the characters are over-the-top and just hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-06-2007, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugly Betty, I pretty much have only seen bits and pieces of as I watch Grey's Anatomy. I think one episode had Selma Hayek doing this talk show about this guy she was engaged to and how he loved her and all that stuff, and she was just using it as some kind of guy experiment, right in front of the guy on national TV. I don't remember much of it, but, it was funny. Usually, I see the endings and they are generally sad, or was it last week or something betty and that nerdy guy were making out or something?</div></div><hr />

I had high hopes for Journeyman but that one got really boring really quickly.<br />

If you have Showtime (or... you know... ways..) you should check out Dexter.  Start with season 1  :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it always has a very soap opera-ish ending but the stuff in the middle is hilarious.   There's one character, Wilamina, who is this horrible evil scheming woman and her ultra-gay assistant.  Anyway, the assistant is hugely fun.  The characters are so well done. :)  <br />
<br />
I guess the model for the show are these s. american soap operas that are immensely popular, way, way over the top dramatic.  But this pokes fun at all that.</div></div><hr />

Was that what that was?  I was in a patient's room last night, and that flashed on the TV behind me.<br />

I was like, whoa, that was weird, did he say what I thought he said.</div></div><hr />

Dexter is great!! I love that show - don't get to watch it much - but luckily I did watch several of the first season so I know the story. Really funny dark humor :)</div></div><hr />
