<br />
Anyone heard anything about these spells?  Are they for the class re-invisioning?  Are they going live soon? How to get them? Etc.<br />

Thanks!  And I'm sure someone at SOE knows, but I doubt they post here.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing each class spell will be along the same lines.</div></div><hr />

You mean we are supposed to actually use these spells?<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that they are currently useless.  Maybe the MPG Fear trial will be adjusted or something.  But most likely some animals will be put into the next expansion that we have to fear for some reason.<br />
<br />
When these spells were just on test, we on The Druids Grove went over why in the world SOE would create them.  We basically came up with the conclusion that they were an easy way for them to fill in the missing gap of higher level fear spells.  Of course, no druid really cared about the gap because of the lack of animals.<br />
<br />
Since we are still waiting, months and months (or years) for them to address that problem, these spells are almost an insult to us.  Who knows, maybe they will actually fix the lack of animals problem in another nine, twelve, twenty, thirty months or so.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is all part of the five year plan to actually retag animals as animals, add more animals where needed, give druids animal slow and finally put druids on an equal level with necros vs undead, as druids should be.  But there is no sign from SOE that this is happening.  And since the patch message reads: Added new level 50+ fear spells for Clerics, Necromancers, Enchanters, Shadowknights, Bards, and Druids.<br />
it once again looks like druids were just added as an afterthought, as in &quot;we need to give the fear classes higher level fear.  Oh, and the druids might as well get it too&quot;.<br />
<br />
So we can all get the new fear spells to rot in our spellbooks, just like the old ones.  Since I really have no desire to fear, charm or slow animals, I don't really care, other than just observing this is normal SOE anti druid procedure.</div></div><hr />

We also looted the cleric and enc ones there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">08-14-2005, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as the MPG fear trial.  The lowest level fear spell works adequately.  I do not see why we would need a higher level one specifically for that trial.  My guess is SKs, Clerics, and Necros wanted a boost to fear spells and someone at SoE said to give to them we would have to give to all that can cast fear hence druids received the new spells.</div></div><hr />
