In answer to your question, do what you enjoy most.  If healing is what floats your boat, go for it.  If you enjoy being a bear or cat more then stick to feral, or if that moonkin dance has you in stitches then balance is the way forward.<br />
Seriously, druids are good at lots of things.  Your guild doesn't get to tell you what class you play, and they shouldn't get to tell you what spec to go with either.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you can be a bit more specific about what you want out of the game, we can advise you better..?  :)<br />

I'd tell the guild to shove it.  Put 30 points into feral to help you level.  Take the remaining and start to fill out furor from the restoration tree.  Work your way down to Nature's swiftness.</div></div><hr />
