<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well. The title says it: Hybrid Gear. I've done a lot of research on DPS gear, tanking gear, healing gear... but what I was never sure of was hybrid gear.<br />
<br />
One thing I've always wondered is... What exactly is there for hybrid gear? When I PvP, I want a good mana pool, and decent health, with some damage to boot; I don't want to gimp my mana in favor of extreme damage (is that absurd?). I'd prefer hybrid gear for PvP, soloing, and being that &quot;guy who does it all&quot; in an instance.<br />
<br />
One thing I'm curious about is it possible if hybrid gear could, possibly, be used as the easy way of getting DPS and tanking gear at the same time, or should I build separate sets? Allow me to explain:<br />
<br />
After doing calculations, I determined that Feralheart was pretty decent for tanking, and did moderate DPS in comparison to items that would otherwise fill those slots. I will still swap weapons, rings, etc... But would just two sets cover all of my aspects?: Feralheart and a Healing set?  I've always heard that druids carry a lot of gear, and I feel as if I'd be taking the easy route in just assembling two sets.<br />
<br />
One other thing I'm curious of, in regards to Feralheart and hybrid gear in general, is the new availability of PvP gear. It lacks the mana I would prefer, but what do you guys think of it for hybrid gear?<br />
<br />
As far as where I am in instances... I couldn't tell you. I'm about to join a guild that is doing ZG and AQ20, working on MC, and so forth.<br />
<br />
So, hybrid gear, let me know what you think? I get the feeling I'll have to mix and match more than anything (another headache, in addition to the pages of research/calculations I've already done. &gt;.&lt;).</div></div><hr />

Epic pvp set is so much easier to obtain and better. Comparing the two sets (6 identical pieces), you get 25 int less in the pvp gear. If you are feral specced with HotW, that isn't even enough mana for a regrowth or one shift. That int could be made up with an enchant on your weapon, while you are gaining a ton more dps on the pvp set. And the 3-piece speed bonus is just icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm... Works for me. I wonder how long it will take to get all the pieces. I'll admit, I hadn't compared the PvP set and Feralheart. If it's only 25 intellect difference... I can live with that. Good thing I didn't turn in all the mats for the Ectoplasmic Distiller yet. o.o *heads back to the AH to cash them in*<br />
<br />
Now I just need to figure out how to make-up the rest of my gear. Hrm...<br />
<br />
Thanks! By the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, here is my take on hybrid gear, since I am focusing on hybrid gear myself.<br />
<br />
There are four main Hybrid sets thus far. I won't go into details about Wildheart and Feralheart, because I never worked on them.<br />
<br />
Lower Tier:<br />
Wildheart Raiment<br />
Feralheart Raiment<br />
<br />
Upper Tier:<br />
Genesis Raiment<br />
Warlord's Sanctuary<br />
<br />
Genesis Raiment is a great hybrid gear if you are focusing on Balance hybridization (eg. not going cloth). You simply can't get any leather set with as much +spelldmg/+healing than this set. Since it also has feral stats, it makes a decent feral core set.<br />
<br />
Warlord's Sanctuary has a strong focus on Feral hybridization, but has enough stats for a decent mana pool and minimal +spelldmg/+healing.<br />
<br />
It's nice to have 3pc Genesis and 3pc Warlord, to get the bonus from each set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion, Bahroo. Though, I'm a feral/resto myself, and I am no where near able to get the Genesis set. I'd get the Symbols of Unending Life if I could... But those would be a lonnnng reputation grind away.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to go full epic PvP set and throw in some other stuff that I wouldn't normally throw in... This way I get more stamina, more mana, and more damage overall. It's a bit unorthodox (I think?), but I think it works for my tastes. No one says you can't mix healer gear with PvP gear, right? :x If you guys want, I can show you what I have in mind.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks again for the help! I really appreciate it... To think I had forsaken the PvP set for lack of mana, when other items can make up for it... Eesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yah, the symbols of unending life compliments the core set. so u can have 3 genesis, 3 warlord, and 3 unending life, or 6 warlord and 3 unending life... etc etc.<br />
<br />
if u can;'t get some of those gear now, in expansion, im sure you'll find a good amount of hybrid items. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">12-13-2006, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I never (except the occasional run in at STV) PvP I had to go for the feralheart set. At this point I almost exclusively use half the feralheart set and the genesis set as my hybrid gear. Pretty decent and has not let me down yet. Mind you that this is only my normal runing gear or when I do instance runs. I have Resto,cat and bear gear as well and I usually carry them around with me at all times not including my shadow,fire and nature gears for raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-15-2006, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends highly on what you want to do, but generally, mix and match is the way to go.  This is what I waltz around in to do decent dps, serve as an offtank, and pinch heal.<br />
<br />
Warlord's Dragonhide Helm<br />
Pristine Enchanted South Seas Kelp<br />
Defiler's Lizardhide Shoulders<br />
Cloak of Unending Life<br />
Thick Silithid Chestguard<br />
Forest Stalker's Bracers<br />
General's Dragonhide Gloves<br />
Defiler's Lizardhide Girdle<br />
Outrider's Lizardhide Pants<br />
General's Dragonhide Boots<br />
Band of Unending Life<br />
Legionnaire's Band<br />
Mark of Tyranny<br />
Frostwolf Insignia (Rank 6)<br />
Mace of Unending Life<br />
Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire<br />
<br />
Most of these items come from 20 man or less raids/PvP.  That makes this set rather attainable. If you're looking for a little more healer, use the Haruspex's Bracers and the Gauntlets of New Life.  I have everything enchanted with top end enchants, so these stats aren't raw, but what I get when i throw this monkey suit on in caster form is:<br />
<br />
Str: 261<br />
Agi:229<br />
Sta:305<br />
Int:284<br />
Spi:184<br />
AC:2716<br />
Spell Damage:108<br />
Healing:108<br />
+8 HP/5sec<br />
+5 MP/5sec<br />
<br />
AC(bear):9819 no points in Thick Hide<br />
AP(bear):942<br />
Dodge(bear):17.25%<br />
Crit(bear):24.25%<br />
<br />
AP(cat):1215<br />
Dodge(cat):21.25%<br />
<br />
This is with a crappy mark (0/5 in IMoTW).<br />
<br />
Again, I like this set for its attainability.  It's not the supreme set, by any means, but it will cut the mustard with the best of them.  This set was designed around outdoor functionality and I encourage swapping out pieces to make your ideal set(s).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWK</div><div class="date">12-19-2006, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completed the 8/8 Feralheart and I find it extremely suitable for playing in the Hybrid role.  Helping my r/l friends on assorted quests I have Tanked, DPS'd and Main Healed using nothing but feralheart and just simply swapping out Weapon(s), Idols (I have all 4 pre-Epic), Rings, Neck and Cape.<br />
<br />
That being said, if you haven't done the Bracers, Belt and Gloves then you may see a better return on your time (and your gold pool) to bypass the Feralheart for the Epic PvP rewards.  The first week of the patch, I got my Shaman his HWL dagger but since then I've focussed on my druid and targeting the Marshal gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">12-19-2006, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">with the Pristine Enchanted South Seas Kelp you would have the zandalar belt, which imo a better allround peice then the Defilers, but thats just a minor thing tho. I would go for the Hakkar neck tho instead of the PESSK, but thats just me, I think the Starfire cast is too long so I dont use it that much, but it depends on specc I would say.<br />
<br />
Never tried the feralheart tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-21-2006, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the Hakkar neck is group dependent (i.e. they have to let you take it.  Most groups won't.)  The Haruspex's Belt is good for healing or trying to soak damage up.  But I believe the OP wanted to maintain decent damage with a mana pool to boot.  The Defiler's belt does that better imho, seeing as how it has the mana and the damage (and the set bonus).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-21-2006, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, thanks for the list, Relevart. I basically picked what you did. I'll definately be using your items as an example, but I don't think I'll take the same items exactly. Thanks, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye see youre point, however I think that with the new spec's Druids have a good chance on 'rogue' gear now tho, and with the druid tank jindo encounter, most open minded raid groups see the benifit of bringing feral(s). <br />
<br />
Whats youre opinion for tanking? Sentinel's Leather Pants (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=53615) or Sentinel's Lizardhide Pants (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=53606) I belive the Lizardhide would do the job much better all around but I think I would like that extra crit and stamina, but would lack som AC. <br />
<br />
For healing I have SR legs, so my main concearn is to boost the AC/stam some, for more all round gear I would use the SR and swap some other peice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">12-27-2006, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For tanking, Sentinel's Leather Pants &gt; Sentinel's Lizardhide Pants</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aurial</div><div class="date">01-05-2007, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just last night respec'd my talent points to focus on Feral/restro , with an emphasis on tanking when possible and healing when needed. I am lvl33 and have basically been waisting all my time becuase I was trying to do balance/feral... so I was waisting a lot of time dying.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my question is, now that I have a more appropriate focus, is there a armor set that people reccommend that is good for +str/+agi and still gives you a reasonable amount of mana? Remember I am only 30+ at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-05-2007, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your best bet at this point is to carry two sets of gear.  There isn't really much stuff at that level that has all stats.  Later on in the game, you will find more gear with str agi stam int and spirit.<br />
<br />
For feral, focus on STR and STA, and for resto, focus on INT and SPI / STA.  You can find some good, cheap green leather stuff with int / spi in the AH, cause really we are the only class that use it.  <br />
<br />
I carry around 3.5 sets of gear with me at all time, one for solo'ing (mostly +str +sta +crit stuff), one for tanking (highest possible AC and Sta I can find), one for Healing (all my T1 and T2 stuff, and various +NR / +FR pieces.  I could prob leave the NR FR pieces in the bank, as they are very situational, but ehh.</div></div><hr />
