The warriors they had were wanting to spec fury/arms for the fun and lower repair bills and I took the offer...now I get to do what I've always wanted...Tank it all. And with the resources of the guild behind me my enchants and upgrades have been coming steadily...so this is what those MT had going for them we always missed out on...now I can see that the main reason more druids aren't heavy tanks is the inability to get the same beneficial treatment as warriors and the predjudices of others and once those barriers are down we will thrive.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw, my new guild warriors are steamed we get the talent to reduce crit by only having 415 def...they all screamed &quot;Nurf Droods!&quot; but they were kidding and as a feral I have never had so much acceptance of my spec.</div></div><hr />

I explained it to them and they were teasing me about druids being overpowered, so I reminded them that there's like hardly any leather out there with def, and they hushed.  xD<br />
<br />
I'm tank spec/geared for raiding, but only main tank when our prot warriors aren't handy, which is fine by me, because I can DPS pretty well in a pinch as well.  :)  Our rogue class leader is more than happy to have me DPSing next to him, since my damage is so close to his.  xD</div></div><hr />

I really like healing in raids, but outside of raids there is so little a resto can do, so I get bored on my main pretty quickly.  I've been working on a mage ( 67.5 now, can already afford his flying mount and just entered Blade's Edge ), and still have a shadow priest and now a shammy that I hop on to from time to time.<br />
<br />
My mage is a blast, but I definitely miss the ability to heal sometimes ( bandages don't count &gt;&lt; ).  While my gf and I were playing our new Draneai, I am having a lot of fun with the Shaman since it reminds me in many respects to my druid.  Took me a while to realise you could only have 1 totem of each type ( earth, fire, water, etc ) out at a time, but I'm starting to like the dynamic more and more as I level ( currently 21 ).  My gf has a mage, so with her nuking and me healing / tanking it has worked out well so far.  She's currently trying a druid ( just got bear ) and is really liking that.  I have a feeling my mage leveling partner is going to become a druid before too long.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty happy with the way druids are now as tanks...sketpical about itemization(tier 4 = meh imho), but it's nice. Did it mostly to save warriors from having to go prot since we pvp as well.<br />
<br />
It's kinda disheartening when I look at some of the gear out of instances and such and realize that any &quot;upgrades&quot; I might get are basically more armor but stamina and dodge continues to go down over what I have currently. *shrug* hopefully will work out.<br />
<br />
I'd like to try 27/0/34 eventually but dunno when that'll be, looks like a great pvp spec...and pve for that matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking about trying the same thing in 6 months or so after I've had my fill of tanking Kara and pvp'ing as feral.  <br />
<br />
The only bad thing that I see on the horizon for that is that I feel that I'm kinda pigeon-hole'ing myself right now in terms of gear choices... I have been taking either feral or healing gear over balance stuff from quest rewards, and if I do decide to take on the 27/0/34 role for raid healing / PvP, I'll have no +damage gear really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's pretty much where I'm at...obviously I upgrade tanking gear wherever I can, and I do have balance gear but we're talking about 300 spell dmg.<br />
<br />
The real question is what do I do with my arena points. I picked up the feral arena shoulders before I put much serious thought into a different spec. Now, I just may save as many points as I can to try and delay the decision.</div></div><hr />

Decent viability for healing and mana efficiency, not bad for quick little bursts of damage, not bad for survivability and when paired with an enhancement shaman in 2 v 2 its starting to look really sweet.<br />

Not bad for PVE either it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild hasn't let me MT yet, but they've come close when we were short on warriors. But eh, OTing Gruul and Karazhan is fun. And staying within range of the rogues on DPS is fun. &gt;D<br />
<br />
It's certainly nicer to see a lot more ferals, and desired ones, at that. I only really knew of, like, two or three on my server (maybe more or less; my server was a new one, and by the time I got to raiding BC was around the corner. So, I never really learned about many of the guilds) before BC, and mainly heard of restos for raiding. Now every guild has about two or three ferals. Can't say the same for balance, though. I don't even think I even know any.</div></div><hr />

But I've done some heroic instances as tank though. That or healer seems to be what people are looking for most, and as I'm 48 feral I'm only a decent healer at best. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">04-27-2007, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You wont ever see me out of feral again, unless something dramatically changes in the Restro/Balance trees.<br />
<br />
If you keep your +healing/int gear up to par with your feral stuff, the benefit you gain from restro/balance trees doesnt out weight the benefit of being able to tank/dps well.<br />
<br />
I spent a day about a month ago and ran some tests on my current 50/11 build vs a balance/restro build.  With the loss of int from HotW, the mana reducing talents werent all that great.  The +% to spells was ok, but still my healing gear is still lacking enchants and a few decent peices and I still have +1200ish in healing.<br />
<br />
I almost see it limiting my druid abilites being outside of feral.  I can go from a raid buff, 12700 mana, +1200 healer to a 22k hp/22k armor uncritable tank, or a 3k attack power/34% crit dpser.  If i go into restro/balance spec, I lose 2 of the 3 dramatically.</div></div><hr />

Healer 1st, Moonkin 2nd,  back to Healing, now Feral Tank/off-tank and DPS, maybe back to healing though now we have good tanks that have leveled up. Also feels good to be financed by the guild for the talent changes. Only problem is guildies get confused when I'm change spec. One of the few that gets to roll on Tank, DPS and Healing gear depending on my spec. at that time. Good to be a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">05-03-2007, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure how I missed this poll.  Anyway, I think there's a huge problem with the choices.  I raid as both a feral OT and a high dps class.  In fact, on certain fights I'm one of it not the highest dps in the raid.  I think the druid attractiveness is being able to do two out of three things.  Every druid should aim to be able to switch roles.  If you're Moonkin/Resto, be ready to pinch heal for your raid.  They'll start to realize you're more than just a dps number and bring intangible things to a raid.  As a kitty, I've even popped out and threw around heals till the healers caught back up (always have a mana pot handy to get back into form).  P.S. Tranquility is &gt; all in certain pyroblast fights =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">05-04-2007, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea a poll isn't the best way to represent our abilities in raids. Sorry about that.<br />
<br />
But I was just polling what your main role is. No matter how diverse we are...we will be specialized to do something for normal fights.<br />
<br />
And Relevart I totally agree with you...Even a raiding druid is so much better when they are able to fill more than one role and it greatly adds to our raid utility and is appreciated by others well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">05-06-2007, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, good point.  The more time my guild spends in Kara the more I realize I'm the perfect OT, not MT, and that's because I can do great DPS as well, even offheal if necessary.  Sure, I CAN MT, but if we have a prot warrior or a prot pally with us, it just makes more sense for me to OT so I can do some of my other abilities when need be.  One night we had 2 warriors with us, so I went ahead and went full kitty DPS.  Had to emergency tank a couple of times, but besides that I topped the damage charts like a rogue would.  It's awesome being able to do that.<br />
<br />
I just kinda voted based on my gear priority though, I still gear up for tanking before DPSing, but have good sets for both obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">05-10-2007, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was discussing taking with the warrior who heads the Kara runs I go on, and as part of the discussion, I came up with a spreadsheet to compare Druid and Warrior tanking stats with some arbitrary values set in.<br />
<br />
Without going into specifics, the thing that was interesting is that while we have what you could consider basically equivalent gear, he's got a reasonable lead on me in physical damage taken from a level 73 mob, but if you drop the level to 72, which eliminates Crushing Blows, I take a significant lead on not only him, but I pass every single Warrior in our guild, including those on the &quot;A-team&quot; who have me seriously outgeared.<br />
<br />
Now, there's more to tanking than just physical damage mitigation and there's a lot of assumptions built into the model, but it was a solid mathematical display for me of what people have been intuititively saying all along, that Druids are your best offtanks.</div></div><hr />
