Rumors are already flying of a new expansion coming out late January/Early February even though DoDH just came out.  Anyone got any tidbits for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I hope not, there's still too much to fix from this expansion, albeit not as much as other expansions but still. But then again it's Sony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway my opinion, for what it's worth, is that anything more than twice a year releases does not give them enough time to roll out and support one expansion before the next is due.<br />

Most guids don't have the power to take down a raid boss, let alone a PoP raid BOSS!<br />
 <br />
Middle levels, SUCK. The middle levels begin when you leave PC and end when you are able to go to POJ (24/25-45) that's about 20 levels that things REALLY suck because everyone during these points are higher level friends to power level the fark out of them, or they get into small groupings of &quot;guild only&quot; people and own everything. I am a soloer I don't have a guild because  I can't find a decent guild to do anything WITH. Random grouping of people sitting around talking isn't fun. Someone come up with a guild that I can like go out with a bunch of the guildies who have shrouded themself to around my level and lets do something like LDON!<br />
 <br />
Shroud... good idea<br />
New expansion... time will only tell, but mainly before moving forward help out the middle.<br />
 <br />
Beginning of the game: tutorial - WOOT! Loved it!<br />
Create the middle game like the tutorial with a bunch of different areas with tons of tasks near? Sure hook me up!<br />

Nice XP, nice solo/group/raid-content in a well made progression. All essentiell focus items can be bought with crystals there.<br />
 <br />
I enjoy DoN (much more than GoD btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">11-02-2005, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mid-levels only suck because of the lack of midlevel players imo.  There's a ton of content for all levels of play if you work through the progression.  After PC I'd say hit High Keep or LDoNs with a group if you can find one.  The really bad levels are the mid 50s when 1 tier of PoP is too easy and the next tier is a bit to hard (53-57) but having not done and DoN stuff I'm not sure how hard those still are.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the game has been made too easy with so many changes geared towards the lower levels.  The tutorial yields gear that people in the original EQ would've been drooling over at level 30.  The tutorial is a great way to introduce things but making it like that for all levels would basically remove the fun of going out into the actual world and experiencing all of the content and zones.<br />
<br />
As for DoN, it's a great one for grouping and soloing... but raid content = 4 mobs only 1 of which is decently difficult. =/</div></div><hr />

GUESS WHAT!! We've been there too, yes im level 70, only like 300 AA's(almost 4 to go) and guild is currently in Inktu ta.  BUT that was due to hard work and putting up with a lot of crap.  Its kinda like a job, you take the good with the bad.  Some players are not for a high end raiding guild, and for them there is some content they can do with smaller end guilds.  There are difficulties and pros and cons with both sides.  There are times when I wish to Tunare i was just all alone in the PoG with no one around but me and natuer so i could scream as loud as i could and no one could hear me cause the game gets so frustrating.  But just about every high level druid here will tell you its not easy to get to the top, but it can be fun when u get there and be hell staying in it:p  Enjoy your time in mid-level cause when u get up to 70, it can get BORING. :p</div></div><hr />

I was thinking about doing velious armor quests for fun recently and then realized how much factioning that would entail &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spanky_p</div><div class="date">11-07-2005, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with a lot of you on the content that lots have not even seen yet. I am no where near being one of the top druids but I am not a underlings like some. I try my hardest to get things done. I make my own groups and even make friends and call on them. I make groups out of guildies when I can to help familiarize each other with their fellow guildies. I love being a druid and sometime wish I had not missed so much coming up. I want those LDoN DoT's but can never find groups for those but I try. I will be 70 before Wednesday and have 102 aa's and have a Warrior that is not far behind my druid but I will be focusing more on hime to help get him aug's and armor to make him raid material.</div></div><hr />

A player found a forum on the EQ Board called &quot;Prophecy of Ro Beta&quot;. That has set of a great deal of speculation. <br />

<br />
The domain hasn't even been registered yet, whereas other domains for other expansions were registered up to 3-4 months before. Therefore this isn't the name of the new expansion. Whether or not the expansion is coming is irrelevant, because we all know an expansion is always coming.<br />
<br />
Edit: the domain was registered, but not by Sony's usual register company. We'll see!</div></div><hr />

Here's a Mobhunter Exclusive for you (well, not really, but I love saying that). Prophecy of Ro will be released on 21 February 2006 according to both Gamespy and GameStats. While the source for that date is unconfirmed and SOE has yet to announce anything about the expansion, the brilliant writers of Mobhunter believe it to be true.<br />
  The beta for Prophecy will probably begin in early January.<br />
  Let the &quot;OMG, no new expansions! Fix bugs!&quot; cries begin.  Oh, they already have.<br />
