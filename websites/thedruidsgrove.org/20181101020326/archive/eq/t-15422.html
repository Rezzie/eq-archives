ZONE INFO<br />
<br />
* Barren Coast - 55 to 65<br />
* Monkey Rock - 65<br />
* Redfeather Isle - 70<br />
* Maiden's Grave - 70<br />
* Deadbone Reef - 75 (sunderock/steppes)<br />
* Suncrest Isle - 75 (sunderock/steppes)<br />
* Jardel's Hook - 75 (sunderock/steppes)<br />
<br />
The combine city is all level 75 content and starts at the direwind/icefall difficulty.<br />
<br />
* Katta Castrum - 75 (direwind/icefall)<br />
* Atiiki - 75 (valdeholm)<br />
* Thalassius - 75 (valdeholm)<br />
* Zhisza - 75 (ashengate/frostcrypt)<br />
* Silyssar - 75 (ashengate/frostcrypt)<br />
<br />
SPELLS<br />
<br />
Spells are sold by merchants in Katta Castrum. You must faction up with those merchants by way of solo quests (at least to INDIFFERENT.) Group missions gain you new currency (Orux) that is used to purchase the spells.<br />
<br />
From Aeia:<br />
Rank1 spells are sold by Halon Griere in The Buried Sea. You need Doublons to buy from him. Fernspur Rank1 costs 100 Doublons, Vinelash Cascade 150 and you need Indifferent faction with Blacksail Smugglers to buy these. Annihilate The Unnatural costs 200, Hoar Frost 250, and you need Amiable to buy these. Amiable is not enough to buy the level 75 spell, but it's likely that the cost will be 300 Doublons and warmly faction will work.<br />
<br />
Solo quests to get faction with Blacksail Smugglers are easy for soloing druids. Most of these require to kill some kind of pirates and/or loot something from the pirates, either in The Buried Sea (monsters in the 70-75 range) or in The Barren Coast (lower level monsters). If you ever soloed anything, you won't have a problem doing these; root-rotting works great. You need about six of the solo missions to get to indifferent faction and about six more to get to amiable.<br />

Tox Forest has been Revamped.  It leads to the Barren Coast, then to the Buried Sea, where you have your selection of islands, or can decend to Katta.<br />
<br />
All raids are in Solertis.  Solertis is accessed via a single group progression arc of 8 missions (think ToB, but harder).  Completing the Arc gives you a high stat ring which is later upgraded to your class item via the Soletris raids.<br />

Likewise, Barkspur is now duration 24 seconds, and can thus be extended to 42 via SCRM and so forth<br />
<br />
Lunar Light (73):<br />
<br />
Heals 2083/2138/2213 for 969/994/1029mana<br />

<br />
We tried very hard to get rid of this... sorry ;/<br />
<br />
 Current 2666/2772/2879dmg for 486/505/525mana ... -100 resist adjust vs. magic, 5sec cast time.  Summoned mobs only.<br />
<br />
10% chance to cast Annihilate Resistances (-50 CR MR PR FR .. seems to be on the same line as Malx line of debuffs so should bounce or be overwriten by any of those spells) <br />
<br />
5% chance to cast Annihilate Slow (25% slow)<br />
<br />
Vinelash Cascade (75):<br />
<br />

On fade, rooted mobs will snare themselves (unresistable) 65% for 5ticks/30secs.<br />
<br />
You do not get a snare wrore off message, because you are not snaring the mobs, the mobs are snaring themselves.  Snare does not occur if root breaks, only on fades.<br />

Yes, but you trade AC debuffing for more attack, so the tank takes less damage, but so does the mob.</div></div><hr />

I can't check b/c the spell parser I was getting that info from is down for the time being but supposedtly AtU was changed a bit. Heard the slow is scrapped and there's now a chance to proc a large dd off of it.<br />

 <br />
Level Changes<br />
 <br />
Fernspur now lvl 71<br />
Vinelash Cascaed now lvl 72<br />
Annihilate the Unnatural now lvl 73<br />
Hoar Frost now lvl 74<br />
Lunarlight now lvl 75<br />
 <br />
<br />
AC debuff changes<br />
 <br />
All our debuffs that had ac debuffs in slot 1 (fixation of ro, sun's corona, glacier breath, hoar frost etc.) had the ac debuff moved to slot 6.   Icefall breath recieved a -41 ac debuff (GB had -35 but it was cut and the cold dmg mod was put in it's place for tss)<br />
 <br />
<br />
Annihilate the Unnatural<br />
 <br />
5% chance to slow is now a 2% chance to cast Annihilate Destruction, a -1000resist adjust 32kx3 dot.  <br />
 <br />
<br />
Lunarlight (nerf)<br />
 <br />
Nerfed back to the original numbers 1695/1754/1814hp healed for 1182/1223/1265.   The increased lvl also amounts to a small nerf if you don't have a tss foci.<br />
 <br />
Avg heal value at last blood lvl = 3120/3228/3339.   <br />
For comparison shm hot will heal 922 -&gt; 1844 -&gt; 2767 -&gt; 3689 -&gt; 4611 -&gt; 5533 -&gt; 6455 on avg (rk 2).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Can still be used as a mild CC tool, in fact an even more powerful one now in certain circumstances and not many monks were trying to use it as a mez tool in the first place.<br />
<br />
I just pre-ordered TBS for my druid purely for lunarlight and vinelash cascade earlier today - seeing the last minute change go in for LL without warning or explanation is very annoying, frustrating and makes me angry.<br />
<br />
Explanation that will likely come out is it was deemed too powerful but, more realistic reason is Prath got so much flak for the Sting nerf that was blamed on druids by shaman, response is to do the same to druids. Off course this will be categorically denied.<br />
<br />
Slim hope it's a mistake but, that I very much doubt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh I remember that.  I used Moonshadow A LOT, not because it is a great spell but because my entire group will die unless I chain cast it.  When I get OOM after 2 minutes I will click my magic button to reclaim my mana back.... every 24 (20?) hours. I wish I get a 6/8 minutes reuse version but at least we have the Mask line for 5 mana a tick.... which is a free moonshadow every 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
I did find the solution though... just group with a cleric/shaman and I don't have to even cast it once. Pally works, if the fight is not too long.<br />

Nothing has been changed.  Druid still do pathetic DPS with pathetic heal.  Before the rollback they are actually fairly decent except for the yawnblur (a spell that will never scale) upgrade.  Now it just look like another TSS, marginal upgrades for a marginalized class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious as to how single healing 6 times can cost less mana than 1 cast of moonshadow.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I get OOM after 2 minutes<br />
<br />
That's more than a slight exaggeration. If you wanna bitch about the effectiveness of the spell, try using some real numbers. <br />
<br />
1.1k mana cost.. You can cast it 3 times in a minute (or close enough to).. so in 2 minutes you can cast it 6 times using 6600 mana.. assuming you have zero mana pres AAs, foci and have no GoM procs or mana regen.<br />
<br />
Also assuming you have none of the above affecting your spells, you would heal 6x1500 x 6casts worth. That's 54,000 points of healing for 6600 mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, in my opinion the recast is too long and it doesn't heal for enough BUT it certainly does have good value for me, in encounters where multiple people are taking damage at once. That being said, with the degredation of foci from 70 to 75, the new group heal (LunarLight) won't find a spot in my spellbook with the current value it heals for.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Having 6 people to heal is the exception. More often than not, you have 3 people or less to heal at any given time. So the healing is wasted on those that are at full hp. In the time it takes to cast moonshadow, you will likely fall behind on healing someone and end up casting a single heal on them anyway. It's all about the timing. Using moonshadow when you have 4 or more people missing some HP is certainly more efficient, but now you lose time healing the person in your group that will lose hp faster I.E. tank or under-geared toon. In a perfect uniform world, everybody will lose hp together and at the same rate, but that rarely happens. So your &quot;real&quot; numbers you posted mean nothing, because they only apply in a fictional world.</div></div><hr />

There does need to be benefits for pally groups heals but greater HP healed and a better hp/mana ratio should be them,  Druid group heals should be better in those regards.  Pally group heals should have a faster cast time and a greater range.  Well at least in my opinion :shuffle:</div></div><hr />

Wind, I respect the fact that you are trying to be an optimist here. And really I think you are prolly a pretty good druid. But WTF. Skin to Vines is what you want to bring up? You want to be frikken excited over the fact it works with DoTs... I have to say WTH ARE YOU THINKING?<br />
<br />
lemme lay out a possible spell lineup for soloing with DoTs...<br />
1.A Snare, pick your fav<br />
2.A Root, pick your fav<br />
3.Blistering Sunray Rk II 247 (make sure other fire dots land) <br />
4.Sunscorch Rk II 529<br />
5.Swarm of Fireants Rk II 384<br />
6.Vengeance of the Sun 412<br />
7.Wasp Swarm 289<br />
8.Vengeance of Tunare 309<br />
9 Heal, pick your choice, just in case you get beat on<br />
<br />
StV Rk2 will increase dmg by 5%.<br />
Add up the extra fire damage (rounding real fast, prolly not exact): 12+26+20+15 = 73<br />
WOOHOO, skin to vines will do an extra 73 points of damage!<br />
But Wait, you have to fit it in! What shall you give up? Wasp Swarm? Sacrifice 289/tick for the extra 73? No thanks!<br />
Dump the heal, hope you don't get hit? The root? The snare? Ok. But why not just add in Swarming Death, at 224 it would still give you more damage than the extra StV gives you.<br />
I guess, if you really, want, you can swap something in and out, in and out. I'd still prolly just swap another DOT in that does more damage but up to you. Fun times for 18% AA killing roots or yellow con mammoths, have fun!</div></div><hr />

I have been playing a druid for a long time.  There is nothing wrong with the druid class.  We are not broke.<br />

I am a raiding druid on The Nameless server and have no issues with our abilities.  I have learned to adapt/adjust to just about every situation I have been put into, whether thats raiding or grouping.  We have been given the tools/abilities to handle just about anything thrown at us.<br />
<br />
Would I like to be able to heal like a Cleric, group heal like a Paladin, nuke like a Wizzy, DoT like a Necro, pull like a Monk or CC like an Enchanter? Sure I would, but then I should of played one of those classes.  I enjoy having the versatility to do all those things.  I am not locked into one specific role.  <br />

Thats it.. no AA's, no progression AA's, 4 spells... <br />

The item seems to have no effect on the Katta Castrum merchants.  I think it only modifies the faction for other merchants.  So far it looks like only the Katta Castrum merchants have spells, but I really haven't explored, so I can't say.</div></div><hr />

I improved my faction with Combine Empire Merchants by doing two solo and one group task in Katta Castrum.  The group task also gave me 50 of one of the new currency (Orux).<br />
<br />
Despite doing these tasks, my faction with the merchants in Katta Castrum seems the same.  I think it is going to take a lot of faction work to be able to buy stuff from them.  They seem to sell spells, songs, tomes, armor, weapons and the new energen &quot;batteries&quot; but I am unable to look at their stock, since they just tell me I still need to &quot;improve&quot; (guess that means faction) before they will sell me anything.  The buy/sell box that opens with them has the new currency in it (although no items yet), so it seems that when they finally decide to sell to me they will only take it, rather than plats.<br />
<br />
I don't remember which of the new currency the spell merchants wanted, it was only one out of the four new ones.  As soon as I visit them next, I'll make a note of it and let you guys know.</div></div><hr />

You do not get a snare wrore off message, because you are not snaring the mobs, the mobs are snaring themselves. Snare does not occur if root breaks, only on fades.<br />

Been trying to figure out what to do with this spell, not that I have it, but just brainstorming. <br />
 <br />
Druid Group Ghetto Mez? Pack of mobs coming in on the group, face the pack and cast VC, 1.5 secs later, they are stuck. Let the tank grab one and start killing. Reroot the pack while they are still rooted, and you can hold the crowd at bay without them surrounding you. Okay. Might work. <br />
 <br />
Maybe it can also be used as an oil slick when you are running away from a crowd of mobs trying to kill you. Turn, fast cast root, turn and take the minute head start.<br />

I don't know what good the snare is for, except maybe on a pull, where you could root two mobs, for instance, and break the root on one, drag him back to camp, then the second root wears off, mob is snared, and shows up in camp a minute after you pulled the first one.<br />

Guess I better start working on my faction. I hate faction. :(</div></div><hr />

I also noticed that other NPCs were still apprehensive though, so remember to check your faction right. Too bad the Aviak Charm wont help in Katta. <br />
 <br />
Faction should go up a level after about 4 missions and then always new spell open up for buying. <br />
 <br />
So far I'm VERY impressed. The zones are amazing, the task, missions and dialogues seem fun and creative. Katta looks great too! I'll move there when I'm old and rich :grin: New human models are nicely done and their armor purdy. Reminds me of what Seru wears... <br />
 <br />
I'm pretty happy about our spells too. I use Barkspur a lot so Fernspur is a gods gift for me. I also read a post from Alla, that our nuke vs summoned should now work on several different type of mobs (golems, gargoyles etc) and be way more useful. Gotta test that. Alla still shows our Hoar Frost as fear spell, hopefully they will update the info soon. <br />

What I do see is a lot of the old arguements about Moonshadow and group heals and druid heals and single healing 6 people and druids not being able to heal and blah blah...<br />
 <br />
I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.  I've never had a problem healing a full group just fine regardless of my buffs or group make up.  On raids, hard high end raids, I heal group fine.  In exp groups, heal group fine...  Only thing I know I can't do is keep the main tank up on a raid level mob encounter by myself.  But then, can any one cleric do that either?  I think not lol.<br />
 <br />
Anyhow, I just don't get what all the complaining is about.  I use Moonshadow, and all the single target heals, our old regens, and in an emergency pop convergence of spirits on someone to save them quick.<br />
 <br />
Things I see worth complaining about include animal based spells we should have gotten upgrades too or that should be added.  Wolf form upgrades that don't suck.  Several other things.  But I for one really don't see what the problem is with healing.  I think I heal just fine and really don't recall very many issues with mana or people dieing beyond what would be expected (i.e. getting 20 mobs trained on you at 5am when u have been exp'n for 12 hours straight and were overnuking for no particular reason and were lom to begin with lol).  Under &quot;normal&quot; circumstances though healing is not an issue ever.. at least for me.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">02-18-2007, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as I see the possible problem with druid heals, is that a druid needs very good heal focus and AAs to be able to heal group efficiently. Recently a friend of mine came back to game, he quit around GoD. He complained that it's impossible for him to main heal a group now (altough we have gotten him some Anguish gear and he's catching up). He just simply lacks the AAs and gear for it, whereas a cleric of course can main heal a group with way less AAs. <br />
 <br />
So average players are in trouble? Could be. Altough my server definately gets it easy because basicly only some quest and epic drops are no trade and one can buy all the gear they want from bazaar. <br />
 <br />
Is this unfair? Unfair that druids have to work twice as hard to be able to heal efficiently or have good dps output? Reading these boards I get the feeling many think so and are frustrated. But I don't see it that way. No matter what, we still have the advantage of being the most versatile class there is and altough some spells we've gotten seems rather useless, over the years druids have been given some amazing new and unique spells I couldn't even dream of when I was level 60 years ago.</div></div><hr />

You need Doublons to buy from him. Fernspur Rank1 costs 100 Doublons, Vinelash Cascade 150 and you need Indifferent faction with Blacksail Smugglers to buy these. Annihilate The Unnatural costs 200, Hoar Frost 250, and you need Amiable to buy these. Lunarlight costs 300 Doublons and requires kindly faction.<br />
 <br />
Solo quests to get faction with Blacksail Smugglers are easy for soloing druids. Most of these require to kill some kind of pirates and/or loot something from the pirates, either in The Buried Sea (monsters in the 70-75 range) or in The Barren Coast (lower level monsters). If you ever soloed anything, you won't have a problem doing these; root-rotting works great. You need about six of the solo missions to get to indifferent faction and about six more to get to amiable.<br />

<br />
Manged to root like 30 or so golems before Sabreyn (the tank) died because It is amazingly rather hard to root said number of mobs as well as be the sole healer for the group when the groups dps level is more toward the moderate then high side.<br />
<br />
I don't suppose it helped the wizard died when the named FDd the tank either.<br />
<br />
It's definatly a specialized spell but came in handy last night.  Could have won I am sure if we had another healer (or some other viable way of dealing with the horde of golems)<br />

 <br />
     once you equp a power source all armors with purity recieve a behind the scenes augment that fits into their slot 1 and/or slot 2 slots (one? or both?)<br />
 <br />
   This augment has maximum stats but you only recieve a portion of the stats based on purity rating of the armor (for purity 45 u get 45% of the aug stats and rating 50 is 50% etc..)<br />
 <br />
    the power rating of 100000/100000 (i might have too many zero's lol ) once you equip a power source the power depletes at a rate of about 2 per piece of armor it powers per second or so (if u have 2 armors that have purity u lose 4 per second, if only 1 u lose 2, etc.)<br />
 <br />
    here is where i found my info http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=107378<br />
  but my question is : once depleted is there a way to recharge the power source? or is it worthless junk after the power is gone..like a disposable augment making device?</div></div><hr />

They have a shield and weapon vendor - I havent seen anything except something that looks like a mixing bowl - Maybe they will have some nice off hand shields and such.</div></div><hr />

     Have to say that pretty much all of the Tbs praet armor looks much better than the Tss stuff.  <br />

I want to say 22 spell shielding but i have my comparisons at work also no stun on tbs but more dot shielding regen and mana regen.<br />

More focus on tbs.....just got shoulders for 13% detri mana pres and the beneficial and detri spell haste will be nice.....along with cold nukes.<br />
