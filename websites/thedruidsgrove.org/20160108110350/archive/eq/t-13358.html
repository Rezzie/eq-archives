<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iliven</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've read on many forums and boards about other Druids soloing and quadding and such quite a bit, and I've never done much of that.  I only soloed up till 16 when I went to PC, grouped at Netherbian Lair, grouped at Dawnshroud Peaks, and am grouping currently in Echo Caverns.  I feel behind other druids that solo often, seeing as that's what our class does a lot.  I just like grouping more and tend to stay in a place I know well (so that I don't get killed out of the blue).  I'm just worried that at the higher levels I won't be able to do well in case most leveling is done by soloing.  <br />
 <br />
Anyone know if I need some serious help or if grouping a lot is just fine?</div></div><hr />

I can tell you that I rarely ever solo. I have played a druid for nearly 7 years and still cant quad kite. I have solod in the past, but about 95% of my time in EQ has been grouped - usually with friends.<br />
 <br />
The only thing that you might be &quot;missing&quot; is the ability to quad kite - not sure that is a necessary function however. As you gain levels, grouping is very nearly necessary to gain the equipment, spells, and gear you will need.<br />
 <br />
Every druid has their own way of doing stuff, if you find you like to solo there is nothing wrong with that, but if you enjoy grouping then by all means :) go right ahead!</div></div><hr />

Grouping a lot is just fine.  EQ isn't really all that solo friendly.  Should you decide to raid later on in life, your grouping skills will serve you much better than solo skills.  You may reach a point where it becomes hard to find pickup groups, so you may have to solo.  If you group with friends though, they generally will keep you grouping until you get past those rough times. <br />
<br />
It doesn't hurt to develop solo skills, and it can be a bit of a boost to your ego to solo mobs.  Ask a warrior how well he solos :wink:  But it isn't going to ruin you as a druid if you never solo again.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Soloing is something for the times you didn't find a group or when you fall behind the requirements of your group. There is no secret in soloning. Find a save place where you can pull to. Pull with snare debuf the mob and start nuking and running, or if you like doting more root the critter and dot it down. ;)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Someone whose skills I admire (good bard) told me at one point he disagreed with my idea that PvP makes for a better player.<br />
 <br />
I thought I'd add it here, since the OP is looking to see if he's missing out on any skills or good experiences (my take on original question) he might pick up outside grouping.<br />
 <br />
Any thoughts?<br />

Perhaps some of the most fun that I have ever had in game was on Tallon Zek growing up and learning to play a druid.  The thing I think that most beneifits me from it is that I did in fact learn how to play all aspects of my class, both PvE and PvP.  The thing I think that is most defining about being on a PvP server is reaction times.<br />
<br />
Now that I play on CT, I find Im faster on heals and re-clicks (rebuffing with insta clicks after mob debuffs) than most anyone.  I also have a better understanding of how mobs react in terms of aggro (since unfortunately on of the natures of PvP servers is the use of mobs to benefit a situation or player)?<br />
<br />
I'm not by any means saying blue server players are in any way  at a disadvantage or lesser for not experiencing PvP.  im solely commenting on the skills that I believe my time on TZ improved.</div></div><hr />
