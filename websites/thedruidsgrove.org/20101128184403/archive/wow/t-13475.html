<br />
<br />
we tried it just now and left Tenebron but the adds were killing us.<br />
<br />
some people said Tenebron was the one to have on various forums and others said Tenebron is a hard one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-20-2009, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">as an update we had to stop trying it with 1D :(<br />
<br />
a couple of people had time issues as it was taking longer than we hoped so after a few wipes we had to kill the drake and then we again downed Sarth without a problem.<br />
<br />
once again i had to heal :(<br />
<br />
the issues mentioned with the drake included people ignoring the adds that then killed people/healers.<br />
<br />
i also find it impossible to Battle Res a dead person especially a healer.....if we lose the MT healer i'm at the wrong end of the area to get to them quickly to save the MT and whilst i'm doing that the rest of the raid is getting no heals from 50% of their healers, incl the OT and tank we used for the adds......<br />
<br />
if we lost the other raid healer then i go out of tree form to res and the raid has a number of seconds with no one healing at all ?  and 10 fps did not help either.<br />
<br />
should i be able to battle res in this fight and we all live to win the fight or is it impossible ?<br />
<br />
anyway we will try next week and if anyone can provide advice as per this thread for which drake to fight it would be most appreciated....</div></div><hr />

It should be something you can cast while in tree form.<br />
<br />
I will say that in the past, the groups I've gone with have left up the center drake- but I'm not really sure why.  Even with one drake up- you have to be careful about those purple void zones, the adds, the fire walls, and depending on how they've positioned Sarth...his tail.  When we tried once on 10 man, the Sarth tank had positioned him in such a way that we were getting knocked into the lava by his tail when we were running from lava walls/adds/shadow voids.</div></div><hr />

For Sartharion + one drake learning purposes, Sartharion + Tenebron is probably the easiest step up, since you have the option of just burning the drake and off-tanking/AOE'ing the whelps without taking the portal. With the others, you either take the portal and waste a bunch of time, or don't take the portal and eat a nasty debuff for a while.<br />
<br />
The main trouble will be the adds, you will need someone that can get aggro from the adds without geting aggro from Sarth (hunter misdirection can work miracle here).<br />
<br />
Tenebron need to be killed ASAP (dps need to blow every cooldown). Get the agro from the add asap too or all your healers will be killed. A good number of players that can aoe dommage make it less painfull. Ranged dps help too as they need to move a little less.<br />
<br />
This fun part is everyone need to give attention to what is happening, and they are a lot that can happen at the same time (fire elemental adds (that you you don't want to go inside a firewall), drakes adds, circle of dead, firewall and changing target often).<br />
<br />
You will need 2 good tanks, 2-3 healers and very good dps for the rest (you realy want to have killed Tenebron before the second drakes add wave). Make sure that everyone understand the firewall, and be ready to have a good number of wipe.<br />
<br />
This is what my guild is tryoing to do, but as we have a good turn over for our guild raiding evening and some players with low dps, we are trying 3-5 times then go kill Tenebron, and kill Sart solo.<br />

<br />
I will have to find out later which Drake we tried it with....it was spawning adds but no portals ?  so does that mean is definitely Tenebron ?<br />
<br />
Not sure now why we failed, although it was our first ever try as a guild and some of us, including me had only done the fight once before the previous week with the guild.  We seemed quite good on avoiding the fire. We did seem to lose the MT/MH to often.  <br />
<br />
I think our main issue was add control....they went out of control and killed people as you mention above.<br />
<br />
We got Sarth down quite a way iirc.....certainly down towards 25% but lost too many people to finish him.<br />
<br />
We are trying again tomorrow with the reset and would like to try 1D.<br />
<br />
My other issue there to date with our 2 tries is my fps both times has been about 8 :( which meant healing and avoiding fire etc was difficult !  This week i should be on my main oomkin spec :)<br />
<br />
Oh and we dont have a hunter.  Very small guild and our only one usually cant make it.<br />
<br />
Usual grp makeup had been/expected to be :<br />
<br />
DK - MT<br />
Pally - OT<br />
Priest - MT Healer<br />
Priest - OT/Raid Healer<br />
Priest - Raid Healer<br />
Druid - oomkin dps<br />
3 Shammy - melee dps spec not sure which that is !<br />
DK - dps<br />
<br />
Maybe a mage this week instead of a shammy.<br />
Possibly a rogue instead of a shammy.</div></div><hr />

Tenebron does primarily shadow damage, and therefor hits much harder than when you just kill him on his own.<br />
<br />
When Shadron is up all fire damage is increased by 100% This is a much bigger challenge because the vast majority of damage done to the raid is fire damage.<br />
<br />
When Vesperon is up he reduces the health of all raid members by 25%. He is very difficult to deal with because he also casts a shield that does around 2k damage per hit to anyone that hits him so essentially players beat themselves to death if they are not paying attention.<br />
<br />
If you leave all three up and can't kill them fast enough you have to deal with all their abilities at the same time. It's a fun fight!</div></div><hr />
