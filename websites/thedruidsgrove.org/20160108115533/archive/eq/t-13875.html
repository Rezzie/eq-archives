How long should this take?<br />
Any zones better than others for the PL?</div></div><hr />

Good luck :wiggle:</div></div><hr />

Do a little searching~<br />
<br />
edit: and 6-8 hours to 35, on a toon without lesson of the devoted, being PL'd be a 61 druid would be easy.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, yes, PC will get you to 20-21 in NO time.  Several zones might work well after that.  Unrest has a few spots that work well, and actually, I like ToFS 2nd floor for upper 20s/low 30s.  Pull with druid, let the mobs go OOM trying to cast on you, and kill themselves on your DS, then have cleric tag them all with PBAoE.  It goes pretty quick.<br />

 <br />
FoB - DS cleric after spell lands and kill yellow/red cons. Do this until 6-7.  (30ish mins tops)<br />
 <br />
Kurns - Same strat, usually do upper floor in a huge circle. Do this until around 16.  (1-3 hours)<br />
 <br />
Echo Caverns - Sucks if others camping it but ive rarely had problems. Now I DS myself (Nettlecoat, shield of nettles, shaman potion) for 107 DS. Pull with snare and have cleric do lowest lvl nuke. Do scouts then bogling chief room then nettlites then cultist room in a huge circle. Do this until about 26.  (4ish hours)<br />
 <br />
Kaesora - Xalgoz room, if your DE or care about faction in OT then need to find alternate. Its all undead and I follow same strat, pulling with druid and letting cleric get a nuke off on each. Do here until about 34-35.  (3-5 hours)<br />
 <br />
The hole - Same strat again, pulling from ent I kill crusaders myself and pull through castle and into the pit, then evac myself and PL'ee to ent and do it again, do this until about 45-48. You may have to stay longer (50ish) if your nuke wont land in velks, I recently did a SK who's tap did, and am doing a shaman now.  (6+ hours)<br />
 <br />
Velks - spiders rock, I just do all the ramps and camps up top, leavign bottom for groups. Velks is fast exp to 55 then slows down a little, though is good until 59-60 easily enough.  (Day or 2,  depending on camps)<br />
 <br />
Sure ive gone beyond what your target was but givse you a game plan for the future. Btw I dont see what lvl your druid is, this makes a difference. The times I offer are based on a druid who can take some hits from multiple mobs at once (was doing it with 6k HP druid) and a 107 DS when I was doing the tanking.  Smaller pulls = more time spent.</div></div><hr />
