I can't be 100% sure, but I don't think there was an equivalent for druids. Eventually, SoE put in the Jaggedpine Forest Druid Armor quests. I did a write up for EQTraders here (http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/article_page.php?article=q36&amp;menustr=120020000000). The write up is a little out of date as they finally fixed the potameid hair drop and the chest piece can now be finished.</div></div><hr />
