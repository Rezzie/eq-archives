Post #2 from a female druid on tallon zek<br />
<br />
I am currently level 56 with only the corrupted seahorse, ulump, and faydedar left to do for my epic.  <br />
<br />
I am not guilded so am only going to take 4 or 5 people into KK to help. 56 shammie, 56 warrior, 56 druid, 60 enchanter, (maybe 56 cleric)<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a guide or has completed this part of the druid epic?  Hints/Tips are greatly welcome =)<br />
thank you<br />

She was a 53 or 54 druid, I took my 61 monk, and we had a rogue (51) friend.  We did fine enough, but to be safe another druid (60) and rog (55) came along and we all took on the tainted/corrupted with zero problem.  Took about an hour of keeping the seahorse cave clear past the mermaid cave.<br />
<br />
I used the map over on eqatlas.com of kedge to plot a course down.  Your group will have zero problems handling things in kedge.  Just keep killing all the seahorses in the area, both in the cave, and in that yellow room (temple of prexus area?  dont remember) and eventually it'll spawn.  Pull to one of the corners in the main area and you're set.<br />

Dire charm makes it easy.  I ended up soloing this part using a dire charmed seahorse.</div></div><hr />

Those that have committed are a 56 shammy, 56 warrior, 56 cleric, and me 56 druid.  <br />
I went to KK last night to just check out where this seahorse spawns and got to them easily enough with invis.</div></div><hr />

Invis up and get down to the edge of the cave near Undertow's spot, kill the mermaid and pull a few horses out, once you cleared first rooom move in and fight in there. Once the spawn is broken its really not to bad at all. When I got mine the tainted spawned near Undertow's spot and at the time he was up, if you want to keep that clear then you have to be very careful pulling. Saying that even he is not tough and I think 1 more person came down and we killed Undertow as well for the Mage.<br />

With what you have this should be a walk in the park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accretion</div><div class="date">03-18-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of caveats....<br />
<br />
I went down to KK for the first time yesterday (ya, I know, hard to believe :P) to help a 52 Druid friend.  It is NOT a walk in the park if you don't know the zone.  Several of the named were up and saw through invis (*cough* Estrella) and the lack of mobility in water, innumerable adds and Z-axis weirdness makes it VERY challenging if things go awry.  <br />
<br />
We had a 63 Druid, 51 Warrior, 54 Beastlord and 52 Druid and wiped twice (although Exodus saved me once) due to the Beastlord's camo dropping at a very bad time plus the fact that none of us really knew the zone.<br />
<br />
We eventually were able to clear our way to the seahorse area, but then the BST camo poofed (without blinking, I might add) and we died when the healers drew aggro and couldn't channel through multiple mobs bashing.  <br />
<br />
Now, after this one experience, I think we could return with the same group and pull it off pretty easily.  I just don't think it's as trivial as folks have made it sound due to some of the zone's...um....features.<br />

The big advantage to an all-monk melee team for the group is that you can FD after killing the tainted to let the druids med back up before you kill the corrupted.  Just make sure the druids are out of sight or out of agro range.  We FD'd for this one, but we really didn't need to.  The group was overkill by a lot.<br />
<br />
BTW, the fight started poorly -- both druids LOM.  We had planned to use pets, but our shark pet broke charm and the tainted killed our seahorse pet while we were dealing with the shark and med'ing the druids.  That's when we moved the tainted out and decided to FD after killing it to let druids med up again.  If you snag a seahorse for your pet, try not to get a cleric seahorse.  It spent all it's time trying to heal itself and none of it doing damage.  Get a squalsurge horse (wizzy horse).<br />
<br />
As Accretion mentioned, though, be sure to bring someone that is an expert at KK.  If you're all KK newbies, this will be a lot harder for you than I've made out.  KK is my favorite under 50 xp zone, so I know it rather well.</div></div><hr />

It has a safe room you can pull to, and there are (correct me if I'm wrong 2 seahorses, either of which can spawn the tainted/corrupted OR the patriarch. Patriarch drops a decent cloak 8ac 6dex 35CR (yes 35CR). There is also, a side room with a tunnel going down to a one shark PH for a named shark that can drop a Driftwood Chest-100% weight reduction, giant sized container. The named have common drops also..can't remember them atm, but breaks the monotony of killing regular ones :D .<br />

<br />
the tainted can spawn near phinny (not his area..the large room before the tunnel that takes you to Phinny)..<br />
<br />
other things..the group you said you're bringing can probably keep the caves + undertows area clear..just to keep you moving and paying attention since this can be a long camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malibu1966</div><div class="date">04-15-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sea horse is a pain. I've been on 3 Sea Horse camps, not counting my own, and they involved a group or two of 50+'s clearing the whole Sea Horse cave area for 2 to 7 hours - very painful.<br />
<br />
Rather than have my friends suffer through this for my epic, I just went down to Kedge every so often and kill 3 or 4 Sea Horses (I was level 59), and zone back out. Then I'd come back 20 or 30 minutes later and check track. Sometimes I'd go back and kill a few more, other times just forget about it. After a few trips (less than a week), the Tainted popped and I had a 60 Epic Mage come down there with me. His pet owned the Tainted and Corrupt, the pet only needed one or 2 heals from me.<br />
<br />
As far as safe spots, I'd usually go into the Patriarch cave - I think there is only one horse there. You can also just Charm one of the horses in the caves where there are two and have them go at each other - root/dot/snare the un-charmed one in case charm breaks. If you get a cleric Horse, nuke and stun as much as you can to try and stop CH. I would also kill in the Grand Hall outside the caves, but you can get fish adds there and an occasional Mermaid.</div></div><hr />
