<br />
the term druid can be used in many ways. I present this for your reading pleasure: <br />
<br />
Prehaps one of the most interesting words <br />
In the English language today is the word druid <br />
Out of all the English words that begin with the letter &quot;d&quot; <br />
Druid is the only word that is referred to as the &quot;d&quot;word <br />
It's the one magical word <br />
Just by it's sound can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love <br />
Druid, as most words in the English language, is derived for German <br />
the word &quot;druidin&quot; which means to be uber <br />
In English druid falls into many grammatical categories <br />
As a transitive verb for instance <br />
&quot;John druided Shirley.&quot; <br />
As an intransitive verb <br />
&quot;Shirley druids.&quot; <br />
It's meanings not always sexual <br />
It can be used as an adjective as in <br />
&quot;John's doing all the druiding work.&quot; <br />
As an adverb <br />
&quot;Shirley talks too druiding much.&quot; <br />
As an adverb enhancing an adjective <br />
&quot;Shirley is druiding beautiful!&quot; <br />
As a noun <br />
&quot;I don't give a druid!&quot; <br />
As a part of a word <br />
&quot;Absodruidinglutly!&quot; <br />
or <br />
&quot;Indruidincredible!&quot; <br />
And as almost every word in the sentence <br />
&quot;Druid the druiding druiders.&quot; <br />
But you must realize that aren't too many words <br />
With the versatility of druid <br />
As in these examples describing situations such as <br />
Fraud <br />
&quot;I got druided at the used car lot.&quot; <br />
Dismay <br />
&quot;Ah druid it!&quot; <br />
Trouble <br />
&quot;I guess I'm really druided now.&quot; <br />
Aggression <br />
&quot;Don't druid with me buddy&quot; <br />
Difficulty <br />
&quot;I don't understand this druiding question&quot; <br />
Inquiry <br />
&quot;Who the druid was that?&quot; <br />
Disatisfaction <br />
&quot;I don't like what the druid is going on here.&quot; <br />
Incompetantce <br />
&quot;He's a druid off&quot; <br />
Dismissal <br />
&quot;What don't you go outside and play hide-and-go druid yourself?&quot; <br />
I'm sure you can think of many more examples <br />
With all of these multipurpose applications <br />
How can anyone be offended when you use the word? <br />
We say use this unique, flexable word more often in your daily speech <br />
It will identify the quality of your character immediately <br />
Say it loudly and proudly! <br />
DRUID YOU</div></div><hr />
