I lost ~11,500-13,000 armor depending on raid buffs.  (8-9% physical mitigation).  I also lost about 4k HP in my non-stam set.  SD absorbs ~1250 damage per proc, assuming the target hits that hard.  <br />
<br />
Trash mobs are more painful than they have been in the past, but slow hard hitting bosses seem to be better (got the dog as one of the bosses, healer said it was easy to heal.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, bear swipe FTW!!!  I was able to pickup and hold the &quot;Dragon Elite Squads&quot; with almost no effort with the new swipe.  Pally's step aside, theres a new ad tank in town!<br />
<br />
My tanking set is almost full &quot;BIS&quot;, how did other druids fair?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding the new instance should I change gems in my stam set and go all stam gems to increase my health for tanking?<br />
<br />
I have a dodge set that has alot of agil and crit.<br />
<br />
I'm the main tank and I lost alot of armor and health also.<br />
<br />
Anyone know how tanks should go with the new instance?<br />
we downed the first boss, after that we couldn't get the next boss and mobs are insane, they hit very hard.<br />
It seems we are going to need a ton of health to tank?<br />
<br />
Please help<br />

My gut says, its just more of the same.  Tanks should wear their agi/crit stuff for trash, but then you'll have to change out to a stam set for several bosses.  (20k+ base damage is not unusual for Uldaur bosses)  <br />
<br />
Fully raid buffed I am around 35k HP in my agi/crit set.  Assuming the nerf was similar for my stam set (I haven't strapped it on yet) I expect to be in the low 40k's with that on.  (Was around 40-41 in agi gear / 50-52 in stam before)</div></div><hr />

I'm far from BiS gear, as our raiding/heroics have come to all but a complete halt recently.  <br />
<br />
I am absolutely ecstatic that you're hitting Ulduar!  I hope it goes well for you all.  I hope that we're still formidable little tanks too!  Go go Bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">04-15-2009, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hiyo,<br />
<br />
I stepped in to 10 man Ulduar last night.  I'm pretty close to BiS for every item.  From what I saw the biggest nerf I took was to armor.  It hurt bad.  I went from about 70% reduction to 65% (about 8,000??).  <br />
<br />
Stamina I actually found to not be so bad for raid.  Raid buffed I hardly lost very much stam at all.  Though I basically went for the new Improved Mark of the Wild for the 2% stat increase.  I expected a much bigger nerf to stamina but I was only seeing maybe...about 2k less stam in caster form.  Fully raid buffed (Kings, Fort, Mark) I was still hitting about 40,000hp and was not in a stamina set so I didn't find anything too terrible.  <br />
<br />
I didn't notice a huge difference.  Personally I'm mildly annoyed by the new swipe if only because tanking has become even more brainless.  &lt;.&lt;   Aside from that I didn't notice any huge difficulties.  We didn't make it very far though.   <br />
<br />
I'll take some more stats and possibly log a WWS tonight to get more stats on the lol-shield.  Last night I couldn't really tell how much it actually helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-16-2009, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had similar exerpience to Sytaera.  I think you may have forgotten your raid buffed HP before though.  It sounds like we are in the same &quot;level&quot; of gear.  I am one or two pieces short of pre3.1 &quot;BIS&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Pre 3.1 I was ~38k-40k armor 25 man buffed and 45k hp.<br />
<br />
Last night I did Ulduar 10, so I did not have full 25 man buffs, but I did have kings, Fort, Flask, and iMotW.  I lost ~5k hp (I hovered around 40k) and I got killed in the armor area, down to 30k-32k (8k-10k armor loss, which i believe is closer to 8%-10% mitigation)<br />
<br />
Due to regular server crashes and vehicle combat, the WWS report was pretty much useless, so I don't know how much SD did or didn't help.  I can say, it was not uncommon to take a 10k-15k hit from trash though.  I was regularily losing half my life.  <br />
<br />
We got the first boss down on the second try (he was really easy)  But then the Ignis trash was brutal.  We ended up scraping half the raid off the floor after each pull it seemed.  We didn't get Ignis past about 90% health.  <br />
<br />
Neither a BIS bear (agi or stam set) nor BIS Warrior could take the unbelievable pounding from Ignis once he got 3+ ads up.  We could not get the fire spots to tick on the ads though, so I think it was bugged.  We eventually moved onto the Drake, and only got one shot at him before the server crashed again (got him to ~75%, but had no organization, I am confident we can smoke him next week).  <br />
<br />
We lost our first hour and half of raid to instance server crashes and quit when the second wave of instance server crashes started again.  So we only got a max of 2 hrs of raiding last night, propbably less.  <br />
<br />
All in all Ulduar is not your cake walk Naxx.  Trash hits HARD!  I am sure there are many tricks we just don't know yet, but I know we wont be bringing our 25man team in for a long time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that shield is useless, it doesn't cover even one hit. I would rather have my armor back. I feel so useless as a tank now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Naxx = 10 weak mobs beating on you, which mean the shield is gone as soon as its up, and wasted on a low damaging attack.<br />
<br />
Uldaur = Fewer mobs, but hitting very hard.  Tough to say for sure if armor &gt; shield.  So much damage is magic, so armor = 0 help for that, but the shield is such a low amount of absorbtion that it will not help much at the moment.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think its fair to judge the bear nerf by Ulduar content.  I had a Warrior tank with me who was getting worked just as bad.  I am planning on running Naxx25 this weekend, so then I should be able to compare apples to apples.  I know how hard they hit before, and I can complare them to now.</div></div><hr />

Uldaur mobs do hit very hard, I was shocked to see my health go down so fast.<br />

<br />
Lol, almost the same situation.  Our warrior tank is excellent, and he had to exercise his right to teleport and repair before we even got to Ignis.<br />
<br />
Props to blizzard for the teleporter and repair man system inside the instance! It is very nice! :clap:   <br />
<br />
Any chance you figured out a &quot;trick&quot; for handling the big gaurds at the top of the ramp or the tornado ads by Ignis?   We just sucked it up and tank/spanked usually leaving 3-5 of us alive at the end of each pull...gotta be a better way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">04-16-2009, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually went to drop a stam trinket for defender's code last night because I was missing my armor.  <br />
<br />
Did you guys find a repair guy yesterday?  It looked like all the mobs out at the entrance despawned either 'cause we killed Flame Leviathan or maybe it was just there for the PTR.  =(  We had no repair dude for last night.  <br />
<br />
The shield does seem to be a lot more useful for Ulduar trash.  I felt it helped a lot in the Razorscale fight because of all the trash there.  With swipe being 360 degrees I could just kite the mobs around spamming that and keeping up a shield.  I never thought I'd say that would be useful.<br />
<br />
For Ignis we basically tanked one of the big dudes far apart from the other and told healers to stand at max distance to avoid the stun/silence.  Burned down one and then killed the other.  Our biggest problem stemmed from this annoying flame DoT we got that would just jump back and forth.  From the tool tip it sounded like we had to jump into water to get rid of it but...the water was beyond another three packs of trash.  Eventually we figured out if it happened to go on our mage he could iceblock out of it and stop the chain.   We tried to outdistance it but it literally jumped from the ramp down to Ignis' room to Razorscale's room.   So we're unsure if that's a bug or not. <br />
<br />
For the tornado guys we've been fine tuning it and managed to get it down to only 1-2 deaths per pull.  Basically we tanked one near the bottom of the ramp and dragged the one we were focus firing up a little.  Stay spread out and run the frack away from the tornado when it spawns.  Everyone basically scatters.  Remember to not back up against a wall because you'll just get owned hard if you're stuck.  <br />
<br />
Last night we managed to down Razorscale and got Constructor to 82,000 HP left (1% !@#$%!#%) but then wiped because two healers DCed right before a tantrum and we called it. <br />
<br />
For difficulty it really seems that the Deconstructor fight is the most straight forward, followed by Razorscale (which is cake once you get past adds of doom phase 1).  <br />
<br />
Ignis himself seems to be the hardest boss in the Siege area.  The add spawns are pretty ridiculous and it's very difficult to get them molten and brittle before the damage stacks really high.  Our best try was something horrible like 90%.</div></div><hr />

Repair guy despawned with Leviathon's trash for us too...oops.<br />

We had a Pally Bubble it off.  It seems it was intended to be removed by the pool, which is behind a half a dozen pulls (hard pulls).  So poor design/Bug I would think.  <br />

Everyone basically scatters.  Remember to not back up against a wall because you'll just get owned hard if you're stuck.  <br />
<br />
Also, always run away from the tornado by running &quot;UP THE RAMP&quot;.  This reduces the fall damage of the tornado significantly.  We too lose 1 or 2 people each pull.  <br />
<br />
We killed Razorscale, and got Deconstructor down to about 35% before we lost our OT for an unexplainable reason.  It was late so we called it after that.  <br />
<br />
Ignis is still way over tuned at least in 10man.  We can't get passed 3 ads up...We cannot get the ads in the fire without the OT getting baked too, and then the debuff only occasionally was stacking on the ad.<br />
<br />
The good news is I was able to MT all the bosses yesterday.  The &quot;Ignis&quot; boss and area is broke.  So the insane work over I was getting is not a result the bear mechanics being broke but instead the instance was broke!  <br />
<br />
Reccomended Boss Progression:<br />
Leviathon (Has to be first, super easy)<br />
Razorscale (Stressful on Tanks/Healers in phase 1, but really easy to get the hang of)<br />
Deconstructor (Again, fairly simple phases to deal with, but lots of raid wide damage, tough on healers)<br />
Ignis (honestly, not sure he's killable in 10 man yet?  I a sure someone has, but it is super tough atm)</div></div><hr />

The armor and HP changes accompanied with SD is a net NERF, no doubt.  But, it didn't make us obsolete.  The Razorscale fight is a good example where Bears are still the preferred tank. <br />
<br />
Swipe allows us to be very mobile while still holding aggro, and we still take physical damage better than Pallies.  Warrior mitigates better than we do overall, but their area aggro is kinda crappy.<br />
<br />
Bears now have arguably the best AOE tanking ability because swipe has no CD and is mobile.  Conc has CD and is stationary.  (Expect swipe nerf asap)<br />
<br />

 Razorscale Strat:<br />
<br />
Phase one, you need to tank the ads and keep them off the NPC's.  NPC's will repair the harpoon guns.  Once 2 harpoons are repaired (in 10 man) you shoot them (think Pinnacle) and they bring the dragon down.  All DPS focus fires the dragon, no tanking of boss needed at this point.  Stay away from the front because he does a fire breath before take off again.  Rinse and repeat until he's at 50% health.  (Note any more than 2-3 landings and you will be overun by ads)<br />
<br />
Phase two, The dragon needs to be tanked.  Keep facing away from the raid, pretty much a tank and spank at this point.  MT will get a debuff that stacks high.  Depending on MT's heal/mitigation, it helps to have OT taunt off around 7-10 stacks.  MT will not need to retaunt as the raid will be dead if he is not killed before 10 stacks on the OT.  Debuff has a 1 min debuff timer, so its unlikely that a tank will be able to drop it and restart before the encounter is over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This fight was bugged until ?Friday? and was hotfixed by Blizzard.<br />
The bug made the person who would go in Ignis' Pot to get a melee-strike from Ignis -&gt; One-Hit-Death!<br />
So it made the fight really impossible in 10man.<br />
The bug still occurs for us, but we hope, that it's just because of the started ID on the instance.<br />
<br />
I was Sarth+3 MT in 25man. So add-tanking is really smooth for me.<br />
I put on my fire-resist-gear, catch an add, stand with it IN the scorch-fire until 20 charges and then draw it in the water.<br />
It's dead before the next one spawns.<br />
Fire is ticking with about 1400-1700 per second, so healing me is really no problem!<br />
<br />
For other bosses in ulduar tanking as a bear is no problem!<br />
Our progression in 10man is<br />
- Flame Leviathan<br />
- Razorscale<br />
- Deconstructor<br />
- Iron Council? (Assembly of Iron)<br />
- Kologarn<br />
- Auriaya<br />
- Hodir<br />
and i have to say, the fights are soooo much fun! Thumbs up for blizzard!!<br />
<br />
A hint for you guys who are whiping at &quot;Iron Council&quot; (we did for about 1h until figured it out):<br />
The big-one strikes the tank with &quot;fusion punch&quot; witch does about 20k initial damage and makes a debuff on the tank which deals about ~15k damage per second for 4 seconds to the tank. This is not healable (at least not in 10man).<br />
But the thing IS DISPELLABLE!!! It's magic, so only the 20k hit lands on the tank, but the other damage can be prevented.<br />
It took my friends and me very long to recognize this, because the only healing-class which can remove magic-effects was not healing me. ^^</div></div><hr />

I'd hate to see Swipe get nerfed.  It doesn't seem like a very &quot;powerful&quot; strike as far as we're concerned, but it allows for a pretty continual proc of SD on trash as well as keeping more scattered mobs under control...<br />
<br />
Quick question for you guys...Is anyone else finding themselves regularly rage starved?  I dropped OOC to pick up Primal Gore (cuz it sounded like fun!) and now I'm constantly rage starved.  Would this be because of SD?  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to fix this?  I've started to build a more AP based gear set which = less stam/armor overall, but even wearing bits and pieces of that plus my normal tanking gear...I'm constantly begging DPS to back off a little so I can get enough rage to generate threat...I've tried tweaking my rotation...it's not making a big difference.  Aside from that though, I'm loving tanking with the new abilities!</div></div><hr />

Would this be because of SD?Funny you mentioned that...last night we ran 10-man reg OS and 2 bosses in Naxx.  I was off tank (though I tanked the dragon in OS).  Other than when I was tanking the dragon I had rage issues.  Even on patchwerk I had a few times when I had to stop using Maul.  On Grobulus, I was tanking the blobs when they spawned.  With just one I'd shift to cat for more DPS (WTB, cat growl!!!), but when I had 2-3 I'd stay bear (full bear spec, but I was wearing my full +hit cat spec gear), and I still found myself rage starved once in a while (I was spaming my swipe/maul macro).<br />
<br />
Not a big deal, but sort of annoying...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm geared &quot;alright&quot; for heroics/Naxx 10.  I'm eons away from BiS gear, and I found that even on trash pulls of 3+ baddies I was hitting enrage every time the cooldown was up.  That's never happened before!  Boss fights were even worse in the heroics we hit.<br />
<br />
We had a mage leave our group in H:VH because I wasn't able to generate threat to save my life.  Zero rage = zero threat no matter how you spin it.<br />
<br />
Should I pick up Omen of Clarity again?  I'm a little reluctant to drop Primal Gore (mainly because it's a new toy and I've not had enough playtime with it yet), but it looks like I  may have to.  /cry<br />
<br />
Do you think it's because SD causes us to dodge less (if the hits are being absorbed, we're not really dodging them, right?) which = less rage generation, on top of the fact that it absorbs the hits?  On a few of the trash pulls, SD was almost a constant shield last night...I'm just a little perplexed by it.  Any suggestions?  Rage potions maybe? lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think a dodged attack would not remove the SD buff.  IOW, you have to get hit before it SD would reduce the damage by some amount.<br />
<br />
FWIW, my pure bear build looks like this. (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#0ZEGGscrzceRcczVkbA0z)  We don't have a single lvl 80 warrior in our guild (of any spec), so I took 5/5 FA and 3/3 IW in order to provide those debuffs as they both provide a significant amount of effective DR (maybe that's why I have rage issues???, though neither is used all that often on trash...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-20-2009, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would have to get hit for SD to block the damage, yes.  <br />
<br />
But if I'm not getting hit because SD is proccing nearly constantly, then I've really got nothing to dodge.  If I'm not getting hit or dodging anything, then I'm not generating rage except for what little comes from a landed attack thanks to talents or whatever I can get from enrage.<br />
<br />
I mean it's not like I'm generating zero rage.  But I definitely don't have enough to work my regular tanking rotation even on a trash pull.  And if the boss hits slowly, forget it...I have to open with Enrage+Berserk+Manglespam to get ahead of the DPS, and even then I don't dare use my entire rage bar up.  It feels like I need to save up some rage for later in the fight when the DPS really starts to roll out their full fury.  <br />
<br />
We're going to try OS-10 (no Drakes) tonight.  Maybe I'll see if I can make my way into a MT spot to see how well I fare against Sarth and see how the rage situation works out there...<br />
<br />
And TLB, I have Infected Wounds as well, just to have that added Debuff...I'm wondering if I should drop that and pick up a few more resto tree talents?</div></div><hr />

Once it has been determined that you are hit and the SD buff is up, you will reduce the damage of that hit by 25% of your AP.  Either way you should get some rage as SD does not block all of the damage.<br />
<br />
FWIW, SD is still horribly bugged.  In one report I read, it proc'd ~200 times, but only ~50 SD &quot;absorptions&quot; occurred.  Read more (http://wowthinktank.blogspot.com/2009/04/druid-limited-savage-defense-analysis.html)</div></div><hr />

Serg, Can you post what gear you use for your &quot;Fire Resist&quot; set?<br />
<br />
I never got to D3 in OS, but started to look into a fire resist set.  2 Drakes was causing us too much chaos and DPS were dropping like flies. I think a fire resist set will be very hand for Ignis though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sure i can.  :wavey: <br />
But this is ONLY Fire Resist and not the one i wear in Sarth+3 (cause that's an aggro-gimped set which contains also my frost-resi-gear for max. HP).<br />
<br />
Head: A green random-drop with 75 STAM, 49 FR (bought from AH)<br />
         The FR head-enchant (25 FR, 30 STAM)<br />
Gloves: lvl 70 Fire-Resist-Gloves for Badge of Justice (40 FR, 52 STAM)<br />
Pants: Blastguard Pants (created by Leatherworkers, full STAM-socketed: 40 FR, 96 STAM<br />
Ring: From the Magtheridon-kill-quest (my guild helped me with that, 10 mins and done :p )<br />
Cloak: Naxx 25er -&gt; Cloak of the Shadowed Sun with 20 FR-Enchant<br />
<br />
I use the 50 Resistance-To-All Flask.<br />
I'm Alchemist so i get 82 FR instead of 50.<br />
<br />
This sums up to 286 FR.<br />
With the Paladin-Aura i go to 416, which puts me in the resistance-category &quot;Excellent&quot;.<br />
So the damage is reduced for about 50-60%.<br />
<br />
I have this setup of items with FR because of the Sarth+3-Trys. I needed the Belt and Boots for my Frost-Resist-Gear for max. HP.<br />
U can swap those for another lvl 70 FR-Gear to compensate for other items u dont have.<br />
<br />
If u dont have enough Badge of Justice, then go farm them solo. (If u are farming or have farmed the Raven Mount then you should have enough of those!)<br />
I went through all Hellfire-Heroics solo + Sethek Halls. 3-4 days and you have all the marks u need.<br />
Just dont forget to look what old Daily-Heroic there is (could be 2 extra Badges for you).<br />
<br />
<br />
My other Equip is currently BiS for me. (except those damn blue boots i wear for stam because loatheb was never kind to me :-/   )<br />
<br />
Hope that helped. :thumbup:</div></div><hr />

Another quick question about this 3.1 disaster...<br />
<br />
Last night we went in to run Gruul's Lair for the achievement.  I had been in my resto spec to heal for OS10, and when I switched to bear I noticed I was missing things like Mangle and Feral Charge from my hotbar.   The unfortunate part is that the group I was with was a random PuG of hyperactive super GO GOers, so they didn't give me a chance to figure out what the beef was going on.<br />
<br />
Well, I instantly died, being that none of my survival talents had any points in them.  So as I lay there as a corpse while the rest of the group was fighting the trash before Gruul, I looked at my talent trees.  It said I still had 61 points unspent!  <br />
<br />
Anyone else have this happen to them?  One of our DK's had the same thing happen when we went into H:Vh a week or so ago.  Half of his talent points had been refunded and the rest were just...missing.<br />
<br />
Just a curious question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure I can find a friend or two that will help me stomp it out. <br />
<br />
Des, There was a glitch in which druids got 72 talent points to spend.  So they reset us again a few days after patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I am almost always rage starved now.  I am not sure if it has to do with SD or not.  Something has significantly changed. I too was ending up rage starved on Patchy (hateful tank).I was OT on a 10-man Patchy 2 days ago (http://wowwebstats.com/v2f4nfb3aqxvq?s=18346-31940&amp;m), I took ~50% more damage than our Pally MT.  I had ~37K health (very few blue gems, 80% agi gems), 88 SD procs, 75 absorptions (many of these are from Essence of Gossamer as it proc'd 4 times), rage starved at times but we lived.  Our healers must have been going crazy as I don't ever recall being below 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't even imagine being rage starved on Patchwerk.  That must have been pretty scary, as there's a delicate balance there.  I know that when we took him on before the patch, the top DPS was only a sneeze away from surpassing my threat, and I was rocking around 97% of the MT's threat.  <br />
<br />
If we took that same fight + me being rage starved, I think we would have wiped.  <br />
<br />
Also, I had gotten only my feral talents partially refunded last night.  My resto talents were all in place.  It was bizarre. <br />
<br />
Also, the day after the patch was released, I had to respec both trees that day as well.  It was just strange.  It happened to a DK and a paladin I know of also.   Just strange.  <br />
<br />
I hope our rage issue gets resolved, if nothing else.  It's made tanking a more exciting experience- but I'm not sure that's in a good way.  Seems my taunt buttons are getting some good use now though...</div></div><hr />

The Hateful tank will always take significantly more damage on this fight.  Our WWS reports have been goofy, so I don't have any hard numbers to give. <br />
<br />
I don't really remember how hard he hits on 10-man, but I assume it must be considerably less if you were not &lt;50%.  He hits me for +50% in one hateful on heroic.  <br />
<br />
I don't use the essence for this fight, because I like to use a trinket rotation mixed with barkskin gives me about 80% of the time having crazy high dodge or mitigation.  2 trinkets with 1 min CD and barskin ftw.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know why Wowhead/Armory/Thottbot...etc don't show world drop gear over lvl 70?  It seems like whenever I ask them to query based on Fire Resist, all I get is lvl 70 or below.  I don't have any level filters on at all.  I know higher level items exist, because I got some off the AH the other day.</div></div><hr />

But, it does make life a bit easier on the healers for Ignis.  The offtank has to hold an ad in fire for 20 secs.  That fire hits both the OT and the mob.  You can use a boomkin to Root the target in place once in the fire, but our 10 man team has no boomkins.  Healing is too intensive to ask our resto to do it, and I am tanking so, shifting would be very very bad.<br />
<br />
Also, if you do Sarth +3 drakes a Fire Resist set is almost required!  :)  I have not been able to do this yet, but everyone I have talked to says, you need a Bear in Fire resist or a DK (in stam set) with perfect timing on cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

This makes it mildly terrible for non-leatherworking druids and you'll find yourself scouring the AH for BoE Fire resist greens.  =/<br />

By the way, I just used nature's grasp whenever I got the add in the fire to root it for Ignis.  It works like a charm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to take what u get. :elfgrin: <br />
<br />
And leatherworking or alchemy are really helpful here.<br />
leatherworking gives you +60 extra FR.<br />
alchemy 32 extra FR.<br />
<br />
@Sytaera:<br />
320 FR and 48k HP pre-pull is correct.<br />
But those are the numbers to survive the flame breath.<br />
If a melee-hit comes right after, u are dead. :axe: <br />
<br />
Thats why my goal was 48k hp with 415 FR. That leaves me with about 10k hp after the breath. (with cooldowns used)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But don't use it now because of the nerf that you only need 10 stacks.  It's not worth it because you then have to smack them while they're in the fire to get them unrooted because it stacks really fast. =(<br />
<br />
@Windsaber: 48,000 HP/Fire Resist is generally earned by stam stacking the frost resist gear.  Being a leatherworker and BoE Fire Resist greens off the AH.  You can also grab a magic resistance flask for another 50 FR.  It's a lot of heavy stam stacking.</div></div><hr />

Yep. Pure stam stacking. My aggro was gimped. I built up ONLY around 300k thread until the adds where down.</div></div><hr />
