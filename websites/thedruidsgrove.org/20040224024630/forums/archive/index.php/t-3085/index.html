<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Panidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got the helm with this effect off one of the aten goos last week, and from what I can tell it definally works. Before I had it Eci's &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; stuck to Aten, but now that I have it, I have not had it resisted once, much &lt;3 for this effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trevize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have this helm too and it now has a nice home in my bank.<br />
<br />
When I first got it I thought it worked too.  Then I realized that my spells stuck just as well before as they did after and I was only in a state of bliss over having won a shiny new trinket.</div></div><hr />
