I'm at 253 enchanting right now, and all of the recipies that I have which are red require either greater or lesser nether essences.  On my server, the GNE's are selling for about 3g each, and buying the last 12 or so is 36g that I'd rather not spend.  I farmed enough mageweave while grinding timbermaw rep to make 17 black mageweave headbands, thinking that some would de into GNE's.  Out of those 17, I got 2 GNE's, 1 large radiant shard, and a TON of dust.  So I'm back in the same boat.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions on how I can either farm mats to make items for de'ing, or a good instance where the drops de into GNE's?</div></div><hr />

You will get the occasional dream dust, but usually they tend to yield essences.  ZF is right around that level for items, but since most drops are blue, it may not help.  <br />
<br />
Another idea, sell the dream dust on AH (since its used in a lot of enchants) and use the money to buy GNE cheap.  Also, look for bargains on green weapons on AH.  When I needed greater eternal essences, I used to buy wicked leather headbands and DE them.  They cost me around 2g each and I had a decent DE rate for GEE (which on my server cost 6-8g each).</div></div><hr />

I just stealthed to the trainer the few times I went in there.  Maybe I should get a buddy and clear the place.  Do you think that a hunter and druid could take down the boss?  He pulls in a lot of adds from what I remember..</div></div><hr />

I can solo everything in there except for the end boss... which unfortunatly you need 3 people to get to.  There is that stone before the door you need 2 other people to be touching to open the gate!!<br />
<br />
So, if you still need it... go kill all the other bosses, including the iron lady.  Rinse, repeat.</div></div><hr />
