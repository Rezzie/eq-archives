<br />
Interesting that even though most of their members support it, the AMA doesn't.<br />
<br />
When polled, &quot;nearly three-quarters of physicians supported some form of a public option, either alone or in combination with private insurance options,&quot; says Dr. Salomeh Keyhani. She and Dr. Alex Federman, both internists and researchers at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, conducted a random survey, by mail and by phone, of 2,130 doctors. They surveyed them from June right up to early September.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whether they lived in southern regions of the United States or traditionally liberal parts of the country,&quot; says Keyhani, &quot;we found that physicians, regardless &#8212; whether they were salaried or they were practice owners, regardless of whether they were specialists or primary care providers, regardless of where they lived &#8212; the support for the public option was broad and widespread.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Numbers of doctors are artificially kept managed by US med schools.  Selected out by admission AND graduation.<br />
<br />
As a model.<br />
<br />
I run a med school.<br />
I admit 100 students.<br />
I graduate the top 25.<br />
Limited to 25 slots only.<br />
Not those who do better than 75 percent.  75 students do not become doctors.<br />
Makes no difference about the scores.<br />
If 50 of the students do 90% or better, still only 25, the top 25, graduate.<br />
<br />
The numbers are maintained artificially to keep the numbers of practicing doctors to manageable profitable level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most doctors LOATH MediCare.  But it does pay the boat payment.<br />
<br />
Many doctors chose working for a system like Kaiser.  They just do the work.  And get paid a salary.<br />
<br />
No matter how many procedures, or what procedures they do.<br />
<br />
I bet that if you polled doctors who did their residency at a KP hospital, but chose to work elsewhere, that most of them would still have a positive review of the system.  Their most probable objection is low pay from it, compared to what they are making where ever they are now.</div></div><hr />

What is your immediate impression of doctors who graduate from Mexican or Caribbean med schools?  Or did their residency there? <br />
<br />
What if you were in charge of hiring a doc, such as a hospital?  Would you want the one who graduated from the University of Grenada/Guadalajara or UCLA/UCSF?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear taking in the other 25 doctors as miltiary doctors is quite popular with the department of defense. Then, go on after their terms of service into the civilian world as pretty good doctors.<br />
<br />
Quote&quot;What if you were in charge of hiring a doc, such as a hospital? Would you want the one who graduated from the University of Grenada/Guadalajara or UCLA/UCSF&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't really care.  Colleges and grades are not a practical application of skill.<br />
I could care less about the doctor with a 4.0 Gpa, that partied their butt off the entire way, or the doctor with a 3.2 GPA that had to work their way through school.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If, as you claim, the reason doctors are overpriced is that their supply is artificially limited, I will remove that limit and have the same quality doctors, except at a lower price.<br />
<br />
We are not talking about doctors from Mexico, or doctors educated or trained under lower standards.  Just doctors that aren't subject to artificial graduation limits.<br />
<br />
And I bet people will line up to get treated more cheaply at my hospital.  Look at all the people in Southern California who take the risk of going to Mexico for procedures, just because it's cheaper.  You don't think those people will go to my hospital, where they don't have the risk, but still pay less?</div></div><hr />

Maybe on the state thing.  Doubt it.<br />

It has been a while but I'm pretty sure it was my NPs name.  Not to say it wasn't backed by someone else at the practice but, to all appearances, she wrote the prescription.</div></div><hr />

In fact, nurse practitioners often have working relationships with physicians. Like a physician, a nurse practitioner can perform the duties of a primary health care provider and can offer medical care to patients of all ages. In most states, a nurse practitioner is legally allowed to prescribe medications.<br />

<br />
&quot;The NP does not have an additional scope of practice beyond the usual RN scope and must rely on standardized procedures for authorization to perform overlapping medical functions&quot;<br />
<br />
An NP can 'furnish' medications under an existing Medical order, or protocol.<br />
An NP can 'dispense' medications, except controlled, upon a physicians order.<br />
<br />
Read the link if you want to figure out what the difference is.<br />
<br />
http://www.rn.ca.gov/pdfs/regulations/npr-b-23.pdf<br />
<br />
An NP, in California, still does not order medications or prescriptions.  Regardless of what your wisegeek site states.<br />
<br />
Additionally.<br />
The nursing field is still comprised of between 92 to 96% women(depending on which stats one uses).<br />
I find it interesting that some would be advocating giving medical duties, doctor work, to nurses.  Nurses, even NPs, who make a fraction of what doctors, still predominately male, make.  To reduce cost.</div></div><hr />

Things like stitches have been done without doctors for several 100's of years, ok, so closer to 3k or so.  Closing up surgeries with nurses can be done, as well as freeing up the workload of doctors, or allowing doctors to treat more patients. Stuff like drainages, prescribing antibiotics, minor ailments like athlete's feet. Things like traumas can often be stabilized before a doctor is even involved. Whatever can be cheaper and still provide good service.</div></div><hr />

Stethoscopes were also gaining in popularity in the early 20th century, but so were the exclusive province of physicians trained in their use. Nurses were not allowed to use stethoscopes until the 1960s. Even then, nurses were not allowed to call them &quot;stethoscopes,&quot; but &quot;nurse-o-scopes&quot; or &quot;assistoscopes,&quot; and the nurses' version of the device was made smaller and flimsy to avoid confusion with the &quot;real&quot; doctor's tool.<br />

<br />
It has been done for many years fyrr. Many women with seamstress skills used to do it, particularly the 1800's and below, why else would they take women near combat situtations, to care for the wounded, cook for the soldiers.  Combat Medics do stitches, clamps, in the field. Vetrinarians and animal biologists do.  They are quite capable of performing the same techniques on humans as humans are classified as animals. Kinda like the other way of burning the wound closed with a hot iron. Those &quot;butterfly&quot; stitches were used on a gash I received on my forearm with a nurse practioner at a workplace first aid room.  Simple procedures like this can be done with other medical personal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a skilled medic were to provide 'stitches' in our country to a person other than him or herself, after discharge from the military, he or she would be imprisoned for practicing medicine without a license.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what you are referring to with seamstresses.  Nurses, nor discharged medics, may suture patients.  Removal of sutures is permitted.<br />
<br />
If by your 'butterfly' stitches, you mean a bandaid.  That is under the scope of practice a nurse may perform without an order.  Steri-strips perhaps?(also under nurse scope).<br />
<br />
Only doctors may suture patients legally.  Anyone else performing that would lose their professional license, face fines and imprisonment.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is true. But, it can still be done. Which is the point I am trying to express, many procedures can be done without the aid of a doctor.<br />
<br />
Quote&quot;I have no idea what you are referring to with seamstresses&quot;<br />
<br />
Many threads and sewing techniques have practical applications.  Many women had these professions deemed women's work while the male was working the farm, factory or whatever. This is not to say many males would fabricate clothing,tailor clothing and such, because they did.  It was fairly common practice for those with that ability to in fact carry over onto injured humans. This practice is also used in many areas without doctors today, Eastern Europe, Africa, India, China, and so on.<br />
<br />
quote&quot;Only doctors may suture patients legally&quot;<br />
<br />
Human patients this is true in the united states, Biologists get away with it with mountain men. As do morticians, theirs are already dead.  However, I am advocating that others can and possess the ability to do such procedures.  I am saying perhaps we can license nurses as well as others to do such procedures.  I am saying perhaps it might be cheaper to have a nurse stitch someone up on simple flesh wounds, closing surgeries. Prescribing antibiotics and such.</div></div><hr />

Yet, more a reason to change many laws. If you can do it better than half the doctors, I don't have a problem with it. There doesn't have to be huge changes in medical laws to set that up.  I have no problem with doctors or medical staff consulting and signing off, I would encourage that practice.  Would it effect your average nurse, probably not. But, it would encourage nurses to advance by obtaining such licenses that I am proposing.<br />

There's supposedly a huge shortage of GP's, this would be a great solution.  Maybe you don't need to incur a quarter of a million dollar in student loan debt to be a reasonably good at doing what most GP's do.</div></div><hr />

We RNs, and to some degree RTs, do many things that MDs use to do.<br />
<br />
When changing ventilator settings, I will always trust an experienced RT over a non-Intensivist doc to make them.  As an ICU nurse we do many 'doc' things that normal docs have no idea what to do, or how much, or how often.<br />
<br />
For example, if I were giving Michael Jackson propofol, he would most certainly still be alive.<br />

Yep.  That is how Coke, and all other sodas were invented.  By pharmacists.  They would mix powders in soda water for their patients.  Found that if you added sugar and flavors to it they tasted better.  Voila, Coke.<br />
<br />
In May, 1886, Coca Cola was invented by Doctor John Pemberton a pharmacist from Atlanta, Georgia. John Pemberton concocted the Coca Cola formula in a three legged brass kettle in his backyard. The name was a suggestion given by John Pemberton's bookkeeper Frank Robinson.<br />

Aspirin, probably one of the first wide spread tablet form of a drug.  Prototypical pharmaceutical drug.<br />

If I have not already written it.<br />
<br />
A CRNA, probably the highest level of practical nursing, still needs a doctor to sign off on all meds given during an intubation or procedure.<br />
<br />
And by the way, if you have your pick between a regular doc(even about half of ER docs) and a CRNA to do your intubation....Choose the CRNA.<br />
<br />
Every time over a regular doc.  I have participated in some really bad intubations with regular docs.</div></div><hr />
