You can configure grid to track your Hots too.  There's a couple of grid modules:   GridStatusHots and GridStatusLifebloom <br />
Available through wow ace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now I'm also using Chronometer, which works out fine for me.  My only beef with Chronometer is that it doesn't count how many Lifebloom stacks are on the target ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regrowth and Rejuv I have as corner dots and they change color as they tick down.<br />
<br />
Really minimalistic not too much info, which is perfect.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like about Grid right now is I had to turn off mana bars on grid because it was causing huge lag on 25 man runs.<br />
<br />
I like to have my eyes on health bars as much as I can, so having to look at candybar timers for hots would kind of disrupt my flow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">04-30-2008, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use itemrack, perl classic unit frames, druid bar, energy watch, ct raid assist, omen (grudingly), and power auras.<br />
<br />
Power auras is an awesome addon.  It adds a really nice visual element to any UI, it looks really sweet and can be handy for delivering certain types of information to you in a stylised manner.<br />
<br />
Basically it lets you make glowy things appear on the screen depending on buffs and debuffs on you or your target, it can also be used to track combo points.<br />
<br />
It's really awesome having flashy things pinging off when I get an omen of clarity proc.  And the whole thing lights up an angry shade of red when i'm at 5 combo points.  It makes dps rotation a lot more fun  :&gt;  I also have some small transparent green leafs that appear when one of my buffs (motw, ooc, etc) has faded.  Nice reminder without being intrusive and looks really sweet :&gt;  The leafs pulse gently..<br />

 You use bartender? how do u handle it not auto shifting your bars when u change forms? ( i personally have 4 bars set up maybe more one for each form)<br />
<br />
btw what is grid</div></div><hr />

For each bar you have the option of setting what page is shown for each form, or not to page shift at all. <br />
Example (my setup): http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/6817/screenshot050108073357em2.th.jpg (http://img89.imageshack.us/my.php?image=screenshot050108073357em2.jpg)<br />
Myself, I have one bar (the one just left of the map) that shifts pages when I shift forms - it takes up  much less space on the screen that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, OK ... I was definitely doing it wrong.  I only had the module set to show in one corner, so all I was seeing was different coloured squares depending on how many stacks of LB I had stacked.  Thanks Zute.</div></div><hr />

ok my biggest delima is if i need to cast MF or something like that when in a form and since that is on my main bar and it shifts to my form bar when i shift. How do u deal with situations like that?</div></div><hr />

I keep them in the same relative position too, so they have the same hotkey.<br />
Or, I have them on the bar to the right of my map, which does not page when I shift.</div></div><hr />

The combination of ORA2, HotCandy, and Clique make MT healing extremely easy when you put the two windows together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">05-12-2008, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to have a TON of addons, more than i can remember to list... Auctioneer and Beancounter (which i didn't understand) to name a few...<br />
<br />
Since the latest patch, when all the addons be came out-of-date, I updated just about all of them, and made the switch from Itemrack to Outfitter (still getting used to Outfitter, but love that items that are used with different sets get displayed when I'm at the vendor and trying to empty my bags). <br />
<br />
I started getting lag issues at some point, which caused a small problem during Kara runs, but became a MAJOR problem last week with Arena... I would engage, and then immediately lag for about 10 seconds, and then come back to being dead... it was causing my arena partner major grief (uderstandably) so i ended up trimming down my addons by a large margin...<br />
<br />
i now run:<br />
-Omen<br />
-Deadly Boss Mods<br />
-AtlasLoot<br />
-Outfitter (a druid must-have)<br />
-OmniCC (awesome for displaying cooldowns)<br />
-Proximo (an Arena must-have)<br />
<br />
i THINK the addon that was causing the lag was called Minna. it was supposed to be a damage meter, but i never used it anyways, and now i'll definitely be more scrutinizing when it comes to addons...<br />
<br />
*edit* just made the switch from Proximo to Arena Unit Frames at the suggestion of my new 5v5 team last night... Unit Frames is SO much better! if anyone on your team targets someone, Unit Frames picks it up, unlike Proximo, where i *believe* (could be mistaken here) you have to actually ouse over the opponent...</div></div><hr />

why chronometer for tracking hots?<br />
pitbull does it too. <br />
i configured my raid-frames, that i see all the druid-spells(and only) as symbols on the frames; u see the duration and the stacks.<br />
<br />
it is also nice when u see the stacks of other druids on the targets. in emergency situations u can consume another druids hot with your swiftmend for fast healing ;-D<br />
<br />
also pitbull shows u the poisons, curses on the targets u are able to dispell by highlighting the frames(shows only poisons in treeform, curses in moonkin and both when u are in caster; its pretty awesome).</div></div><hr />

Altho they very small and when you are in a full raids there are so many symbols/spells on there you lose track, hence I use chronometer.

i dont know right now (im at work). i will look and tell you as soon as possible. I'll add a screenshot with my raid-frames to show you how it looks.</div></div><hr />

Here's what my Grid looks like with lifeblooms going:<br />
http://members.cox.net/npm/u2.jpg<br />
<br />
It ticks down seconds and 10ths of seconds and is green if 3 are stacked, blue if 2, yellow if 1.  The boxes in the left corner indicate rejuv (top) and regrowth (bottom) they also change color depending on time left.  They turn yellow just before dropping.<br />
<br />
I've also got it showing me who has aggro and who is high on the threat list.<br />
<br />
Here's an annotated version of my UI as it was about a month ago.  I've made a few changes since.<br />
