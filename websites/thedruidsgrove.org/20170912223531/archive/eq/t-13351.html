TO PROPHECY OF RO<br />
EDIT: Seems not all classes get an aura from the Takish-Hiz Ghost quest. Those classes may possibly be getting traps instead from a different quest npc. For those doing the Ghost quest for their auras, the 4 named have had their respawn reduced to 10mins.<br />
<br />
I've also added a section for new armor sets.<br />
<br />
How do I register the expansion?<br />
<br />
Go to https://secure.station.sony.com/eq2/accounts/station/EditLogin.m - This will take you to your Account page. At the bottom of the page is the EDIT REGISTRATION button. Click on that and enter your PoR key (if you bought the box.) If you purchased digital download, just start the game, no key entry required.<br />
<br />
How do I claim my horse?<br />
<br />
If you bought PoR from a retailer and not from digital download, you can claim the new warhorse. Once in the game, clear a top inventory slot (remember you have 8 new bank slots now!) and then type /claim 9 for the bridle. You can only claim 1 warhorse per account so be careful what toon claims it. This warhorse has a slow run speed, but the bridle can be combined with a faster mounts bridle to upgrade its runspeed.<br />
<br />
How can I find the new PoR zones?<br />
<br />
Arcstone (L65+ zone): The portal to Arcstone can be found at the top of the Academy of Arcane Sciences in West Freeport. The Academy is the large tower in the middle of the zone. Step on the teleport pad on the bottom floor, then run up the ramp to the top for the Arcstone port in.<br />
<br />
The Ruins of Takish-Hiz (L50+ zone) : In the SW corner of what used to be Oasis at 2800, neg 375.<br />
<br />
Elddar Forest: 103, -177 in Ruins of Takish-Hiz, appears as a Sand Storm.<br />
<br />
Devastation: Entering EFP from NRo, run into EFP and through the arena. Near the Arena is a Warrior Guildmaster with a large white statue standing next to it. Click on statue to zone into The Devastation. Description of zone two posts down.<br />
<br />
This is the zone progression:<br />
<br />
South Ro -&gt; The Ruins of Takish-Hiz (incl. Root of Ro instance) -&gt; Eldarr Forrest -&gt; Tunare's Shrine (Instance)<br />
West Freeport -&gt; Arcstone -&gt; Relic -&gt; Skylance<br />
East Freeport -&gt; Devatation -&gt; Sverag -&gt; Razorthorn<br />
Theatre of Blood -&gt; Deathknell (raid zones, quest for access)<br />
<br />
A map of Antonica, updated with the expansion zones, can be found here (http://samanna.net/gen.info/maps.shtml).<br />
<br />
Where can I get my L55 spell/ability?<br />
<br />
For classes with Aura spells: In the Ruins of Takish-Hiz to left of zone is Lilthill's Ghost. One of the tasks shows The Chalice of Life as a reward a belt. Kill 4 golems one for each season. This Task is soloable.<br />
<br />
Lifestone Guardians of Summer, Spring, Fall and Winter are in each corner of the Ruins of Takish-Hiz zone. Their respawn timer is now approximately 10mins. They are non-aggro unless you attack first iirc. They do summon and hit just under 500. They Wander, roughly one in each corner.<br />
<br />
You need to look 4 gemstones. Lifestone of X where X is equal to the Guardian you killed.<br />
<br />
Returing all 4 to the ghost (its a task, so doesn't have to be at once) yeilds the belt and the spell.<br />

Where can I get the rest of my new spells/abilities?<br />
<br />
We are collecting that information in this thread: http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13274 - Many of these locations/missions should work for various classes.<br />
<br />
Where can I start my PoR Armor Set quests?<br />
<br />
Tier 1 sets<br />
Quest NPC: Lady Usher, -200, 1700 in Arcstone (she is just West of the port out platform)<br />
<br />
She needs a mold and a Spirit Mark to make the armor. The molds can be bought from her (2100p for chest &amp; leg mold, 1050p for all others.)<br />
<br />
The Spirit Marks drop in Arcstone and Plane of Rage. Lady Usher gives out a task to retrieve them.<br />
<br />
A list of Chest piece clickies by class is being compiled here (http://www.necrotalk.com/index.php?showtopic=5593&amp;st=0&amp;#entry59369).<br />
<br />
Tier 2 Sets<br />
Drops from mobs in Theater of Blood (druid drops from plant type mobs)<br />
<br />
Druid Armor Sets are being tracked here (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13376).<br />
<br />
How can I raise my faction in Freeport to get Mission Givers to talk to me? <br />
<br />
Hail the NPC in the West Freeport newbie yard on the East Wall by the PoK port in book. He will list four to five NPC Mission Givers in Freeport whose tasks will raise your Freeport faction and unlock other mission givers. Details to come.<br />
<br />
From Dev: <br />
<br />
You can find the [faction] tasks [for high level players] in Freeport by talking to Erling Elsai in West Freeport or Reidar Elsai in  North Ro.<br />
There are 2 types of tasks. Type one raises your faction with everyone, but slowly. Type two raises your faction with a particular group (Militia or Knights) more quickly than the other tasks.<br />
<br />
The first type of task asks you to perform tasks that are just generally good for the city, like clearing undead out of the Theater. I think both the Militia and the Knights can agree that's a good thing.<br />
<br />
The second type of task requires you to perform a task that would bring favor from one group but not the other. You can use this path to work on your faction with one group or the other. <br />
<br />
How do player set traps work?<br />
<br />
No direct info in the game yet, but this was in the PoR PDF that came with the expansion:<br />
<br />
Most traps are available to players in the same way as spells, through specific quests and mission rewards. Once a trap is memorized, it is created by summoning it. The trap will remain in the area in which it is summoned until it is triggered, removed by the player using the new Remove Trap skill, or expires. Player traps can be used to affect non-player characters in a variety of ways. Some cause damage effects and some cause other effects, like snare or stun. On player-versus-player servers, traps will affect both players and non-player characters.<br />
<br />
Here are examples of available traps for level 70 players by class:<br />
<br />
Rogue - Poison Spikes Trap - Constructs a trap of poison spikes at your feet<br />
which will trigger when enemies draw near, causing them damage over time and slowing their movement rate.<br />
<br />
Wizard - Fire Rune - Scribes a fiery rune on the ground that will explode and damage enemies that wander within range.<br />
<br />
Magician - Rathe's Grasp - Opens a weak portal to the Plane of Earth that will reach out and grab any enemies that wander within range.<br />
<br />
Necromancer - Death Rune - Scribes a rune of death at your feet that will curse enemies that wander within range, causing damage over time.<br />
Traps may be for classes that didn't get Auras.<br />
<br />
Where does the evolving cloak I've been hearing about drop?<br />
<br />
The Steel Warrior forums have an excellent thread started listing quests and rewards. You can find it here: http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=14044<br />
<br />

Entering EFP from NRo, run into EFP and through the arena. Near the Arena is a Warrior Guildmaster with a large white statue standing next to it. Click on statue to zone into The Devastation. (I apologize I do not have a loc)<br />
 <br />
Devastation is a large zone where there are apparently constant warring factions at battle. Vah shir, trolls, orcs, goblins, undead, shilliskin, bone golems, drachnids, to name a few. The zone itself is roughly circular shaped with a large castle in the center. It appears that all NPCs are KoS but killing different mobs adjusts faction by losing for that faction and gaining for three other factions in the zone. There are areas in the zone that have particle effect Auras where as you near the banner in the center of these areas an emote is triggered that &quot;you gain a sense of strength as you near the banner.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Exploring we found multiple named mobs that conned red. Many see invis. Mobs seem to have a small aggro radius as I did a lot of running around without invis and did alright avoiding mobs.  There are many destructible items around the zone, - catapults, ballistas, tents, lean-to's, and walls to structures.<br />
 <br />
Fun quirk about the zone. When you die, you are returned to Devastation. You are fully dressed, but have a nakid, unrezzed exp-loss corpse. We had a necro with us thankfully.<br />
 <br />
The castle in the center of the zone has a Stronghold door which is destuctable. Upon destroying the door, you zone into another zone which started with an R (again i apologize for the lack of detail). It was called R******, Stronghold of Sevrig(spelling on the name also incorrect I am sure). <br />
 <br />
Here there is a big bone golem standing right at the zone in who is non-aggro and gives out multiple single player tasks to be completed in &quot;Devastation&quot;. He seems as though he will give out more tasks after that faction work is completed.<br />
 <br />
Also in the &quot;R zone&quot; there was a mission giver who gave a mission in an instanced version  of the zone. The mission itself was long, but not all that difficult. Mission was called &quot;Hero's Challenge.&quot; Once ported in the task updates to confront the first challenge. We cleared the first level of dwarf and barbarian NPCs and got an emote that the named became active. Killed the named and his two companion puppies and got the update to go to the next level of the zone. Had 3 levels of the zone (first humanoid npcs, second Minotaurs and another hairty thing, third bone golems and giants) and their associated named to kill. <br />
 <br />
Upon death in the zone (our poor necro puller and his baby pet) you get an emote saying that you have X many deaths left. You are allowed 9 deaths total during the mission (or so Sullen Zek says). On the final named after killing the three named there is a permarooted Bone Golem surrounded by skeletal summoners. We engaged the mob and at ~75% he spawned 2 adds (a dwarf and a minotaur). We believe these were from the 2 deaths that our necro suffered and that the number of adds coincide with the number of deaths that occur during the mission.<br />
 <br />
Got a 15ac ~180ish hp/mana mask with a mana pres on detrimental spells up to level 70 drop from the final named. <br />
 <br />
Sorry if this is the wrong forum - but figured I would post what we found last night as The zones were not listed in the above post.</div></div><hr />

I'm a lvl 61, but got my aura at lvl 60. A lvl 70 druid guildie took me and my best friend (lvl 57 mage) there to help us get our auras. He killed them (took aprox 10 minutes for each kill), and I kept him healed. I never once got summoned for healing. I know it's not really soloing, but I'm sure you could find another druid to go with you and keep you healed.</div></div><hr />
