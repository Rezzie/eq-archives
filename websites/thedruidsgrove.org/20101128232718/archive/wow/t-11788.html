<br />
Just asking for some quick advice on my current gear.. If there is anything of the sockets I should change .. you know.. all that stuff..<br />
<br />
Link to my armory:<br />

<br />
Thats my PVP gear as of now though so I have insignia equipped - I usually have the Bloodlust Brooch there, otherwise its usually what I wear...<br />
<br />
Sitting at about 2.3K AP and 33% crit selfbuffed in kitty...<br />
Working on getting the Gladiator Helm next..</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general I would use more more agi gems then crit gems, but thats just splitting hairs tbh.(and the fact that some gems are damn expensive :( )<br />
<br />
Myself I prefer the Ogre Slayers band over the allerian ring(Edit; having a look at them both, maybe I shouldnt), with my pvp gear Im almost at 2.3k AP less crit(29% I think) but have ~9k HP self buffed, I lack resi tho.<br />
<br />
Think that maybe +4 stats are overall better on bracer(Ive just switched to that myself)<br />
<br />
Im a very casual arena kitten who only go there when I feel like it for fun, ooh ..and DB isnt the best pvp server I know, but my 2v2 team beat some well geared A'A teams from time to time tho ;)</div></div><hr />

I just got back from a pretty massive WoW break so the arena rating isn't all that good ;) Ill try to focus more on 3v3 and 5v5 from now on tbh :)</div></div><hr />

And +str is always better for us than +AP.  I just got the midnight legguards tonight, debating what to socket them with, but I'm leaning toward 2 +8 agi ones and a +4 agi/+6 sta.<br />
<br />
I like teh agi when I'm in kitty ;_;  With my current pants (not the legguards) I'm finally over 35% crit self buffed, which I'm really liking.  Haven't had much of a chance to arena much yet, but it seems like the more I crit, the less we lose  &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

This works excellent until everyone starts getting arena gear.  once the serious teams get arena gear, druids (and rogues...) will be largely inconsequential.  Your crits either won't happen, or the damage will be reduced by their 200 resilience rating.  Thats the unfortunate part about being a kitty druid in arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well , Yes and no.<br />
<br />
Crit kills in pvp - make no mistake about it.<br />
<br />
Pvp especially for a feral druid in kitty is  based off burst dps.<br />
<br />
I have already fought quite a few teams with full arena gear and you do indeed notice the difference crit wise - but you still do crit and depending on your gear you can still hit decently hard.<br />
<br />
I have heard of people going for more a attk power route vs crit due to this ideology.<br />
<br />
Only time will tell.............</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.<br />
<br />
Not saying information doesn't.<br />
<br />
But, PvP in wow is largely based of burst dps. Especially arenas.<br />
<br />
Matches aren't longevity based at all nor even with full resilence will they probably be. <br />
<br />
The balance is enough burst dps dmg to take down who you need too when you need to while your teams cc's and heals as needed to keep going.<br />
<br />
Substained dps just doesn't cut it for pvp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">05-25-2007, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, guess that's true, I didn't think about the part resi plays in arenas too much.  Like I said, I'm new at it myself, and my rating sucks, so I'm not seeing the best geared arena groups.  Stacking pure str/AP and sta and resil would be better then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But now , im no longer feral :-(  I got tired of PVP/Arena all the time so I joined a pretty high raiding guild... Specced resto, with a few points in feral ... <br />
Brekster is broken :(</div></div><hr />
