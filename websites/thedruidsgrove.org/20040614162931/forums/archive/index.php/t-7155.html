All of a sudden I'm hit with a wave of nostalgia over EQ.  Sheesh!  I started thinking how cute my shammy kat was, how cute my halfling druid was.  <br />

Someone slap me!</div></div><hr />

Hey, I'm bigger than this small wave of nostalgia.  I just ground it out mercilessly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinjre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iagoe swears there should be a LFBG flag you could put up. (Looking for Better Group).  Current groupmates would not be able to see it.  He thinks it would make his EQ experiences much better.  I found my experiences much better when I only play 3 hours a month, and always with guildies I've known for a long period of time.<br />
<br />
I think gumby is supposed to be nostalgic.  So is Laverne and Shirley.  If you want some real nostalgia, see here:  http://www.retrocrush.com/costumes/index.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LauranCoromell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The longer you are away from something the easier it is to look back on the good things it seems.  Just remind yourself of the reasons you left in the first place and see how you feel then.<br />
<br />
I haven't left the game yet, at least not to the point where I never log on.  I'm not really playing though, only getting on to say hi to some friends and see what tradeskill items might be on the vendors for me to bake or brew or whatever.  No real reason to be there at all, other than p/ling a friend recently I haven't really played in a long time.<br />
<br />
I feel the time coming when that draw to say hi just isn't strong enough to make keeping the game going.  I know people say they will keep in touch over email and all but seems they drift slowly away.  Anyway, when the time comes for me to sit down in Kelethin and camp out for the last time, I don't think it will be too hard to do.  I've kind of weaned myself along the way for too long now.  But I'm sure that, like you, from time to time I'll look back at the good times.  However, I'll be missing what was at one time, not what is now.  When it happens I may have to ask you for that friendly slap :)  Sooo...here you go...slap.  Really just do what makes you happy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Araxx Darkroot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've recently been flooded (ok, it was just a trickle, but I had to add some drama somewhere) with memories from my EQ days. Good thing was they were about the discovery parts of when I began playing, like when I ran from Freeport to Qeynos to (that human druid place closeby - sheesh I forgot the name!!) at level 14 just to buy SoW, and I ran right past Rivervale hehe...<br />
many other things also, but that will always be one of the most memorable. :D<br />
<br />
Good thing I prefer to say &quot;Better have these good memories instead of the bad ones&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EverQuest Memory Album (http://home.att.ne.jp/surf/mirage/memory_album.html) - Great Flash Movie (big download)<br />
<br />
I'll admit I've gotten nostalgic for EverQuest a few times.  I've even logged in and ran around to some of the zones, but I just can't get interested in playing again.  I almost accomplished everything in EverQuest I wanted to, and whenver I log in I just feel like there's nothing to do.  *shrug*  It's still a lot of fun to run around and see all the old areas though.  Still have to do that anniversary wand quest just for that fact.</div></div><hr />

Gumby is Nostalgic.<br />

Not to mention he is such a pimp.</div></div><hr />
