The goal is to let you switch specs very easily in raid, even between fights ! However it won't be possible to switch specs in the middle of an arena match. With dual-spec introduced in the game, there are also discussions about an Itemrack-like mod being introduced to the default UI<br />
<br />
&quot;between fights?&quot;  This is a huge win for Druids and all hybrid classes.  I'm not sure I like this at all.  Why would you ever bring a pure DPS class?  Their buff?  I figured there would be an hour cooldown or something.<br />
<br />
They haven't given full details yet, so I have to wonder if their won't be some odd limitation and/or $$$ requirement.</div></div><hr />

lol<br />
<br />
yea, i think this works very heavily in the favor of druids, pallies, shaman, and to some extent, priests...<br />
<br />
hell, i may even go dps/resto for my 2 choices while leveling just in case we need some heals to run an instance<br />

<br />
I can decide if I'd go &quot;pure bear&quot; and &quot;full resto&quot; or &quot;Feral Hybrid&quot; and &quot;full resto&quot;?  Or some weird Balance/Resto Hybrid?  Ugh!  I have a hard enough time keeping up with one spec, let alone 2-3 more.</div></div><hr />

I read today that there are 12 new 5 man instances and the new Naxx has 15 bosses!  Soooo much tanking to be done!</div></div><hr />

This is just because people don't want to be forced to choose anything in the game.<br />

How ever I'll probably end up Resto and Balance because they can share gear and I've been a happy Dreamstate spec for awhile now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just out of curiousity, what exactly do you expect a class who's only use/purpose is do DPS to do besides watch the meters?  I think thats the first step in &quot;L2P&quot; a pure class well.  <br />
<br />
BTW - My main is a T5-T6 Mage, my new favorite alt is a -T4 druid.  I can assure you I have L2P my mage and not L2P my druid, however the druid is a far superior character.  Simple fact, &quot;hybrids &gt; pure&quot;.  Ask anyone who plays both with some conviction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-13-2008, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was a bit unnecessarily negative I agree; I've been annoyed with some &quot;pure&quot; dps classes in game recently.  Specifically, recently: rogues that &quot;suck at kicking&quot; (their words, not mine), that can't sap for cc because spending the talent points to maximize that particular utility &quot;does nothing for my dps&quot; (another direct quote), and mages that refuse to weave sheep or spellsteal into their rotations because it compromises their numbers on the meters.<br />
<br />
The term pure implies those classes have no utility beyond maximizing raw damage output, which is not true and has never been true.  And it will be even less true after the patch tomorrow and in LK.  That's what I meant by they need to l2p.<br />
<br />
Edit: My brother's response when I told him about the rogue: &quot;You can suck, but you can't suck at kicking...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appoligize too for misunderstanding.  I surround myself with &quot;pure&quot; classes that have been around a long time and just assume every mage has a focus macro and spellsteal macro'd to there favorite spammable cast.  <br />
<br />
(BTW, by adding spellsteal to my Scorch spell, I will increased myDPS dramitically.  I started stealing so many buffs I may not have even noticed in the past.)<br />
<br />
I suppose its like the common hatred for Hunters.  Having a T4/5 Hunter and then PuGing my way through outland on my druid, I learned to loath every hunter I came across until they gave me a good reason not too...(hate to admit it, but stereotype are born from reality)  I suppose the pure DPS classes, all of them, are just too easy to be bad at.  Hybrids definatley provide a more challenging gameplay, and force you to l2p in order to succeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest fear with this new feature is the affects it will have on cliques within a guild.  By giving the &quot;in crowd&quot; instant access to more specs those on the &quot;outside&quot; can (and will) be left out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed Solarflash; I became a theorycrafting/game researching/EJ geek after getting my rear end handed to me in groups while I was levelling as a Boomkin.<br />
<br />
I understand that concern, tlbj.  Guild politics is worse than real life sometimes.  Our guild doesn't work that way; we are mostly made up of families and working adults with erratic schedules, and we go out of our way to make sure those that want to raid and have good attitudes about it get a chance.<br />
<br />
The only thing we don't do is guarantee raid spots; we generally get 12-15 people to sign up for our 10 man runs.  Unfortunately we usually get the same number for our 25 mans...thankfully that won't matter in another month.<br />
<br />
Anyway, head on over to Kel'Thuzad and pst me for a /ginvite!  First 10 toons to 80 are the raiding &quot;A&quot; team for Naxx.  :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

Probably doing full prot/full ret with my prot pally, that will come in so handy.<br />
<br />
Oh and full resto/enhance with my shaman.  :D</div></div><hr />

n00b question....what's with everyone talking about raiding Naxx these days ?<br />
<br />
is this some new place different from the old one pre BC ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as for spec i cant wait for dual specs. i seriously wanna have a oomkin for Wrath so this will allow me to have an oomkin spec and then my feral tanking one. :alc:</div></div><hr />

This way I can Tank the trash and pullout and be an excellent splash dmg healer when we are fighting single tank bosses.  <br />
<br />
The only reason I don't go full resto, and instead a boomkin resto is for PvP viability.  I don't PvP much but if the gear builds mimic those of the past, some of the best, easiest to attain tanking gear will come from PVP.</div></div><hr />

Now I have to gear up for tanking and healing doh!!!Blizzard hasn't said how they are going to implement this yet, so you might have to be lvl 80 before you get this feature?  Or you might have to buy it?  Quest line?  Who knows...<br />
<br />
That said, I agree a Feral Hybrid/Resto is a nice combination for leveling.  In fact, that's probably what I'll end up with.  Though if I find I don't need to heal that often, I may do a  Feral Hybrid and Balance/Resto Hybrid combination.  The later would give enough healing to be a strong off-healer (and maybe 5-mans), yet still do some DPS while you are healing.</div></div><hr />

The glyphs were designed to be disposable like buffs for changing situations.  At least that is the impression I get from the low cost of mats etc.</div></div><hr />
