Now he's about to expose much more &#8211; himself.  (http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20310981,00.html)<br />
<br />
And here's his tell all (http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20301958,00.html).<br />
<br />
SnippetBut that wasn't all. In a wide-ranging interview with Vanity Fair in its October issue, out nationally Sept. 8, the teen says that the onetime vice-presidential nominee's frequent self-description as a &quot;hockey mom&quot; who put family above career was far from the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even before she was nominated, there wasn't much parenting in that house,&quot; he says. &quot;Sarah doesn't cook, Todd doesn't cook &#8211; the kids would do it all themselves: cook, clean, do the laundry, and get ready for school. Most of the time Bristol would help her youngest sister with her homework, and I'd barbecue chicken or steak on the grill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talk of Quitting<br />
Palin often complained that her job as governor was &quot;too hard,&quot; according to Johnston, and after spending a couple weeks of being gloomy about losing the vice presidency, she focused on making money instead of the needs of Alaskans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah was sad for a while. She walked around the house pouting,&quot; Johnston says. &quot;A week or two after she got back she started talking about how nice it would be to quit and write a book or do a show and make 'triple the money.' She would blatantly say, 'I want to just take this money and quit being governor.' &quot;</div></div><hr />
