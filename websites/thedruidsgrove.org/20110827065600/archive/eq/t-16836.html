<br />
I have been away for over 3 years. The last thing I was doing was hunting skellies for Elysian Gear but I have now upgraded all my equipment way above that from the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Where is good to solo these days? I prefer root/rotting or quad kiting to charm kiting. I vagely remember charming in PoN and not getting on very well with it :-) I'm just after xp for the moment, I want to grind a few AA's as I don't have any yet!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

They changed things so that the less you have of them the easier it is to get them, and having the right AAs helps a lot with however you prefer to play EQ.<br />
<br />
At level 55 you can still root/rot and kite, but soon that will become increasingly difficult and by the time  you reach level 70 (inverse) charming is the only viable way to solo (i.e. you charm an animal, send it against another animal. Due to the changes to charm the uncharmed animal is vastly more powerful and will tear your charmed one apart. Just before it is killed you break charm and root it. You then charm the other animal and kill the previous charmed animal yourself. It is an evil way to play for a protector of nature but we have been so reduced in solo ability that it is about the only way left to us).<br />
<br />
As for the location, you probably want to look at the appropriate zone in the Serpent's Spire exapansion.<br />

I'll stick my xp all the way to AA so I can just get used to it for a while. Any suggested spots? The elysians I was fighting were very slow, only for the armor really. I can't remember where I was before that.</div></div><hr />

I would reccommend Western Wastes, the various animals there, Maiden's Eye, charm a spectral wolf and go to town aslo fun quadding there. Othimir's in cobalt scar quadding still a goodie. Nadox, although I reccommend it at 58, charm a bloodtusk beast. Sony hasn't made very good content 55-60, for awhile now. Also try out Plane of nightmare, that should have some good opportunities both kiting, root dotting, and charming the nightstalkers, and various other mobs.<br />
<br />
Eri is right though, in later expansions, mobs increase hit points by a very large margin, so, root rotting, kiting and such can take largely forever to kill something.</div></div><hr />
