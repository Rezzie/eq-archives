My gear, and everything else about me, is crap I know, problem is, I just spent an hour looking on Alla and in bazaar (Fennin Ro server) for upgrades and didn't find a damn thing, so some actual input rather than obvious comments that don't help me a single little bit would be nice, ok?</div></div><hr />

At 62, if you are hunting in WoS or NC, look for the random trash drop belt and shield.  Foresight Sash, forget shield name.<br />
 <br />
Gain levels.<br />

Are you in a guild?  Do they raid?  What do they raid?  Do you solo or fight in groups?  We need a bit more information to be able to tell you what to look for.<br />

Alternatives:  Master Cultural Armor from DoN<br />
DoN crystal armor...there is a set around 60 or 65 as well as the top end for 70 I think.</div></div><hr />

Used to do Kael raids a while ago as just a guild, but they were canceled because so many people never actually showed up.<br />
<br />
As for NC and WoS, I have gone to NC with some people from my guild a few times, its where I got a new shield. Drakescale Shield, less mana, but 2 mana and hp regen. But from what I've heard its almost impossible to get a group in WoS at my level unless you're a cleric, so I haven't gone yet.<br />
<br />
Finally, DoN armor. Like I said before, I'm poor, can't afford crystals by my self. And also, like I don't think I did say, I'm a complete idiot. So far I've done one DoN mission, collecting the eight silks in Lavaspinners, and that was only because someone in my guild had started working on the task the day before, but had to leave before they could finish. When they got back on I was invited to come along and help.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I've really got no clue about some of the high level things that some people are always talking about. I used to play a lot, over four years ago, and I feel stupid saying that I still haven't learned nearly as much as I should about everything that's so &quot;new&quot;. Feel free to laugh at me relentlessly, I'm sure everyone does anyway.</div></div><hr />

I've been putting off getting to 63 because I only have one of the spells already, Swarming Death, and I definetely don't want to level until I at least get PoT9. From 56 to 62 (excluding 61) I already had all of my spells before I leveled, and I've just got into the habit of getting them. Sad, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Luckily for us druids that they are pretty common in the bazaar.  you could probably pick some up in the bazaar for 1-2k if you are patient enough.  check the quest here (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17842)[/URL]<br />
<br />
those gauntlets of dementia have to go also (but dont worry i used them too).  check out in the bazaar or camp:Pristine Jeweled Gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17842)<br />
Speckled Clay Handwraps (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27561)<br />
Mushroom Cap Gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=44999)<br />
Wanderer's Sylvan Gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17409)(ornate leather glove pattern)<br />
mushroom cap gloves or ornate are probably best bets.<br />
<br />
you're doing well by getting some drops from Wall of Slaughter.  :clap:<br />
<br />
Try to nab a Veil of the Windstrider (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17409) from there too, for +2 mana regen.  also from there are Infernal Ring of Regrowth (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30769)[URL=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30482&quot;] (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30769) and Bloodstone of the Dance (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30482)<br />
<br />
<br />
some drops from Nobles' Causeway:<br />
Drakescale Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30592) - random zonewide drop<br />

<br />
good luck!! and don't be afraid to level even though you won't have ALL your spells.  honestly some aren't worth the time/expense at the level you are supposed to have them.  it's easier to go farm plat or camp your spell drops at level 66+ instead of holding at level 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">01-30-2006, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deiffin, a lot of DON good equipments require level 70 to wear. Think about it: you don't want to spend a lot of money for an upgrade, only find out later that you need upgrades again. So level to 70 fast (doing the HHK mm will get you there in several days).<br />
 <br />
You can skip most of the level 63-65 spells and buy level 68 ones, they are better -- except for mask of the forest I think.<br />
 <br />
For the focus effects you need the most for soloing: <br />
 <br />
Mana preservation V (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=6419)<br />
Muram's Anger(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=6426)<br />
Extended range V (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=6413)<br />
 <br />
There is a list of items under each of the focus effects, so you have a choice -- make sure they are dru useable :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deiffin</div><div class="date">02-05-2006, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you, everyone, for all the help... Although I have yet to level up (need money, so spent most of my time foraging for Lillies in DL except for a brief trip to NC with some guild mates), I have acquired two much needed upgrades. Changed my tunic to a Tanned Wurine-Hide Tunic, and switched to Wanderer's Sylvan Boots... Unfortunetly, I have yet to find something to replace my HORRIBLE gloves, but I'm still looking. I plan on at least spending more time in NC with guild mates, hoping that maybe I'll get lucky enough to pick up a Foresight Sash to replace the Cherry Blossom Belt that I've had FOREVER (It's getting really annoying, maybe I'm just going insane).<br />
<br />
Taking a short break for today to work on a few projects for Physics (evil), but when I get back on I  plan on either going back to NC with the guild, or maybe heading to Corathus to TRY to get those Mushroom Cap Gloves.<br />
<br />
Anywho, thanks again for all the help, and if you see me in game, I beg of you, PLEASE don't sit on me!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want all your specs before levelling, you can solo them in HoH, in the SE basement, last room.  There are 4 human guards that can easily be single pulled and soloed, and they can drop spectral parchments.  Drop rate isn't great, but since they are also level 62, the XP should be quite good!<br />

<br />
good luck on mushroom gloves!  but another cheap option would be to buy a pair of expert's gloves and expert's symbol if you can find it.  that would be slightly better than those dementia gloves.</div></div><hr />
