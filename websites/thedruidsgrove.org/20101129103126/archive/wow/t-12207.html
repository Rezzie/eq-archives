<br />
The thing is, I've only run Kara as Feral, and the good healing drops go to the main healers.  People often forget that Druids do, in fact, have a right to greed Healing drops.<br />
<br />
So, next time I run Kara, I'm going in ToL so that I may be able to lay claim to the good drops.  Can someone post a decent set of pre-Kara gear that I'll need to be able to get by with in Kara?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">11-19-2007, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly get up to abou +800 healing with pre kara gear.  Get yourself two nice trinkets (lower city prayer book I think fits this) with a big +healing on them when used.  Then practice keeping rolling lifeblooms on multiple targets.  That is the key.  My first night doing that (with substandard gear) I took over like 40% of the heals for the night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(basically everything I got before going Feral)<br />
<br />
Head: Crown of The Forest Lord (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27763) - Heroic Underbog<br />
<br />
Neck: Natasha's Guardian Cord (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31691)<br />
<br />
Shoulders: I still use Wild-Growth Spaulders for the amount of +heal they give but I haven't yet got a Mantle Of Autumn (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28340) from Botanica.<br />
<br />
Chest: Lifewarden's Breastplate (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29781) but if you've done that quest already then the Raiments of Nature's Breath (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27456) from Heroic Ramparts.<br />
<br />
Bracers: Lucid Dream Bracers (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27827) from Heroic Mana-Tombs<br />
<br />
Gloves: Gloves Of The Living Touch (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29506) Crafted Item.<br />
<br />
Belt: The Sleeper's Cord (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28398) from Arcatraz.<br />
<br />
Pants: Moonglade Pants (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27873) until you can get the Earthsoul Leggings (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28591) from the Chess Event in KZ.<br />
<br />
Boots: Boots of The Glade-Keeper (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28251) Cache of the Legion in Mechannar.<br />
<br />
Rings: There's too many to list.....the Violet Eye reward is good.<br />
<br />
Trinkets: I use the Bangle Of Endless Blessings (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28370) and Scarab of the Infinite Cycle (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28190) as when they proc, you'll be casting and regen'ing very quickly.<br />
<br />
Weapons: Again, lots and lots to choose from. Most rep rewards are better than you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tempest Keep is a good set of dungeons for healing gear. In Mech you have boots and shoulders. In Bot you have helm and shoulders. And in Arc you have Main hand and .. something else. I'm sure I'm missing other pieces, but can't think of them off hand.</div></div><hr />

I see this staff drop all the time</div></div><hr />

<br />
The neckpiece dropped about 85% of the time for me.</div></div><hr />

LOL</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">11-22-2007, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The moonglade set is more of a hybrid set, imho.  There just aren't enough healing stats to justify wearing it as a healer, even though the set bonus is awesome.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">11-30-2007, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the set bonus on the moonglade set is awesome (one of the best set bonus' in the game, IMHO, after things like the two-peice T3 set bonus).<br />
<br />
As silly as it may sound, the kodohide gladiator pvp set has really good healer stats and if you have luck like me, is good to work on in parallel to instance running. Many of our better healing peices drop in kara (which you can run once a week) or heroics (once a day) and some of the bosses in heroics have very deep loot tables from which you may never see the item you want (speaking from experience here).<br />
<br />
In my opinion, as a fulltime feral druid, the hardest part I've had with my resto set is keeping it enchanted and slotted properly. I never did get my healing mace from exalted Shatar faction enchanted, but am getting the drop from Maiden enchanted this weekend. Just too much money for people who raid 16+ hours a week in addition to having lives and full time jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sey</div><div class="date">12-04-2007, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moonglade gear is fine.  You'll be low on intellect but that's normal for the early raiding druid healer.  Just make sure your gear is fully buffed with gems and glyphs and enchants.  <br />
<br />
Exalted rep will is your friend:<br />
-Exalted Sha'tar for the healing mace<br />
-Exalted CE rep for the healing off hand<br />
-Exalted Keepers of Time for the cloth healing bracers <br />
 (Yes they're cloth but they're decent)<br />
-Exalted Scryer or Aldor rep for the +healing shoulder enchant<br />
<br />
Also get the +35 healing glyph for your helm from Honor Hold rep.  And get the +70 healing trinkets from Lower City Rep.  And there is at least one decent +heal ring you can get through rep faction I think.<br />
<br />
For gems go with the [+28% healing -2% threat] meta in your helm.  Use +18 healing red gems where you can, and hybrid (+healing +spirit +int +mp5) gems elsewhere to help fulfill the meta gem requirements. <br />
<br />
For enchants go with +heal on your gloves, bracers, and weapon, +mp5 on your chest, vitality (+mp5) to boots, and subtlety (-2% threat) to cloak.<br />
<br />
For other gear, don't forget the healing leather belt from Arcatraz.</div></div><hr />
