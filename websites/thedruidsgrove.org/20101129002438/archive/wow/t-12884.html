GC posted this yesterday...<br />

'here is what we're inclined to do about Balance. It isn't a done deal yet because we just talked about it and didn't make the actual changes yet, so it's possible we'll hit a snag (though I don't see why). <br />
<br />
Moonfury and Earth and Moon down to 3 ranks from 5, but keeping the same overall benefit. That buys you 4 extra talent points to get more utility or fun talents. <br />
<br />
We are also going to buff Eclipse's damage a little so that you feel you're paid back for the extra proc-watching (and so I won't feel so lonely when I tell you I think it's fun). <br />
<br />
We're going to leave the Starfire glyph as is for now, since one of the reasons we added it was to buy you back some brain time if you were watching Eclipse too much. <br />
<br />
The treant health is still something on the list to look at too. I suspect it just hasn't scaled well.'</div></div><hr />

There were just too many MUST HAVE talents in the existing tree.  Hell I had to skip a bunch that would have been really useful because I just couldn't fit them in.</div></div><hr />

-----------------<br />
Update on Eclipse. Here is how we changed the talent. <br />
<br />
It now has a longer cooldown (40 sec) and a shorter duration (10 sec) but the effects on Wrath and Starfire are doubled. It is overall a buff to the damage to justify the proc-watching aspect. We also hope the longer cooldown and shorter duration will mean it takes less of your bandwidth to do so.<br />
