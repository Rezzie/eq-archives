What is the usage for the new level 61 DON fear animal spell 'instinctual panic'? It suppose to fear animals up to level 60. I can't think of a place when you can fear a level 60 animal safely.</div></div><hr />

In beta it lasted ... 1 sec.  I believe it is still random, not fixed 3 min.  That's why I've never got it.  Only a few zones where resists are an issue for me, and as healer, I'd really rather not snare anyway.  Let the wizard :wink:</div></div><hr />

Up to now it ever lasts 3 min. i have nearly no resists. There are many spots like RSS where it was my duty to sare the mob before it starts to flee.<br />
 <br />
Even in Fire when i go soloing i have both snares memed the lvl 29 overwrites the lvl 69 and i have much less trouble with initial snare resists when i kite. Espacialy when i have the propper buffs up and quad there ;)</div></div><hr />

I didn't know it ever was, but I am sure happy they fixed that. It has replaced the old ensnare in my lineup in most situations now, and I reccomend it for everyone. I also have Extended Torment 4 which makes it last closer to 4 minutes. <br />
<br />
As for the fear, I haven't gotten any of them, as it seems pretty useless even with a higher cap. I can't think of anywhere to fear kite animals for good exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that I'm 69, I've started using Serpent Vines where the mobs resist ensnare.  I really do prefer snaring early since once I start healing, I tend to forget to snare.  Pallies are nice that way, you can practically snare on incoming :wink:</div></div><hr />
