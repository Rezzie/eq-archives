I'm looking forward to leveling this character, since she's soooo versatile.  It seems like I can do just about anything with the right gear and spec.  It's mind blowing.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have a question.  What's the easiest/fastest way to get to 20?  I have a 22 druid on another server, but he was 18 when I picked him up again, and I don't really rememeber how he got there.  I'm only lvl 13 right now, and things feel like they're starting to drag a bit.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hanging out here in the future,<br />

Getting from 13 to 20 is probably the biggest challenge druids face.  From a purely personal perspective I'd recommend using the Draenie lands.  YOu'll have to go play in the NE lands for your class related quests, but for speed of leveling 13-20, the Draenie lands have a much better quest layout.</div></div><hr />

When they come in close, hit moonfire and shift to bear (make sure you start your auto-attacks!!!!), enrage and swipe/maul when possible. Be prepared to drink often.  Use bash to stop runners (or put moonfire on your bear bar).<br />
<br />
13-20 really, really, sucks for Druids.  I didn't have that many problems with my priest or hunter in that range.  There is also a slightly painful point in the early 30s (seems like you have self-heal way too much), after that leveling Feral is quite easy (and fun).</div></div><hr />

So bear is a good idea to use while questing/soloing before I get cat then?  It feels like I'm doing more damage with bear, but I wasn't sure if my dps was higher.</div></div><hr />

So bear is a good idea to use while questing/soloing before I get cat then? Save bear for the last hit or two.  The mob should be less than 40% when you shift to bear.  Unless, you are inside since you can't root.  Though in 2 weeks you can root indoors!!!  Woot!</div></div><hr />

Another change that I'm ecstatic about is the fact we're getting a non-combat rez.  The fact that all we got was battle rez was something that was bothering me about druids for quite awhile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to our Druid's Grove :&gt;<br />
<br />
As other druids here have said, 13-20 is a very tricky period for young druids.  I can sympathise as I have recently started a second druid, an alt who will also be resto.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
I've found the best thing of all to speed up levelling is to find a nice mage to conjure you some water.  Then at least you can drink all the time.<br />
In terms of the actual spells and stuff I use, I normally open with a wrath, then immedietely entangle the mob while my wrath is still travelling towards it.  Then I continue to spam wrath, and if the roots breaks and runs towards me, the last thing I do is Moonfire.<br />
If that still isn't enough to kill the mob, I shift to bear form and kill it that way.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, levelling gets much easier once you are level 20 :&gt;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Overtime</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tips Annikk, yeah I know that a druid's life begins at 20.  I have a 21 druid on a server that I just transferred my main (warlock) from, so I know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Pretty much what I've been doing to kill mobs is wrath x2, moonfire, shift to bear and maul until dead.  Seems to be working, but those pesky murlocks are fast when they run, so sometimes it's wrath or moonfire to kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sounds fine.  Low level druids do not have the most powerful or elegant methods of grinding but that's all you really can do at this early stage.  Soon it will be cat time ! ^_^<br />

 <br />
Not to mention that you will end up with a Blue caster staff or stam 1h dagger (quest reward) and Blue stam cloak (exalted with Tranquilien).<br />
 <br />
Yeah, I'm leveling my new druid Root right now too.  I'm only lv 6, cause everytime I get on him I get called to raid on my warlock or warrior, but I'm not looking forward to the grind up to 20.  The spell rotation that you mentioned is right.  Just think, at lv 21 we will be racing around 30% faster than everyone else (&lt;3 feral swiftness)</div></div><hr />

I just dinged 17 after finishing my aquatic form and cure poison quests.<br />
<br />
Worst case, I'll likely play my druid for a few weeks after wrath is out to avoid the stampede to Northrend.</div></div><hr />

Rule #1 when leveling an alt when you have a raid ready toon or two....Don't guild the baby toon just yet!<br />
<br />
I struggled to get my priest leveled while in guild.  So when I roled my druid, I didn't add her to the guild until she hit outland.  Sure, most of my guildies knew I was on an alt, cause I would hang out in Vent, but when I didn't see guild chat and people didn't see my mains online, the request were far fewer, and I never felt guilty about not helping guildy &quot;X&quot; through an instance because I didn't see them post in Guild Chat.  (I have a hard time saying no when someone needs some help with a quest/instance.  Although I am getting better.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol yeah Solar very true. <br />
 <br />
I have a few other 'stealth' toons (27 priest 29 hunter and 16 rogue) that I play every now and then when I want some mindless quiet wow time.<br />
 <br />
I have a hard time also when ppl specifically ask me to help them with something...<br />
 <br />
Overtime - The aquatic quest actually takes a lot of time runnign around the world iirc.  Now that you got that out of the way, and you are almost 20 (woot catform at 20 and increased run speed at 21), the levels will start flying by.</div></div><hr />

The hardest part is now over, leveling will go much faster. Have fun!</div></div><hr />
