I haven't gotten the cycle thing to work yet. Yet another feature that doesn't work as intended.<br />
<br />
I did that already and the cycle target thing still didn't work. Congrats on crappy coding once again Sony.<br />
<br />
and the charmer, when you find out that it was your fault, not sony's why you couldn't set up the button:<br />
<br />
It was on an unused key. Oh noes, my functions have been stoeled by Sony Entertainments!<br />

5 Days<br />

Time remaining: 5 Days, 0 hours<br />
<br />
- What part didn’t you get? - if your going to be negative to the administration.. then all these /reported threads must mean something.<br />
<br />
As for the game? There are better ways -</div></div><hr />

Problems are brought up here all the time by people trying to get problems fixed so I was trying to understand the logic of what you posted. I have to say though it doesn't seem like a very mature way of dealing with a post that you don't like by banning me. Makes me wonder if I hit a nerve...<br />
<br />
By the way Ladred, I meant that I assigned the cycle targeting to an unused key and it still didn't work, so in other words Sony's fault. To use Sobe's crack: what part of that don't you understand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, Autumn12, Sobe's sent you a number of PM's regarding your indescretions previously...which never get replied to.  Thus, I can only imagine Sobe figured doing so, again, would be pointless.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you didn't ask an honest question, you asked a smart assed question about a senario that you can't honestly believe, given the Sony bashing which frequents our boards.   You know full well people are free to say what they want on this board, for the most part.  Sobe simply asked that rants be kept to the rant section, for the most part.<br />
<br />
You, however, seem intent on forming a bloody conspiracy for everything.  Perhaps, while you're on your 5 day break, you can go put your mind towards the Kennedy assassination or the Moon Walk.<br />
<br />
Finally, if I were the Boss, you're attempt to circumvent the 5 day ban by creating another account would inspire a permanent ban.</div></div><hr />

But when Autumn** creates another account just to keep arguing, well he's got zero integrity and strikes me as a reall baby who has to have the last word. I for one will look at any advice, suggestions or comments from him, past present and future in that light and ignore it all. Ban him all you want, he'll create a dozen different accounts and flood this forum with BS.</div></div><hr />

You also don't seem to know the definiton of integrity. Look it up.<br />
<br />
Ban me for all I care, at least I was honest and called things as I saw them rather than becoming one of the sheep that seem to frequent this board so much. That being said, I'll leave you to your cloistered little forum now.<br />
<br />
P.S. You made a negative post WEDruidVZ so prepare to be 'suspended' for five days. You won't be? Of course not, because you're one of the sheep. Baaaaaa!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WEDruidVZ</div><div class="date">04-28-2004, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you don't care, then why make the last post...LAST word and crying. And IF they do ban/suspend me, I'll abide by it becuase they are the Moderators and have every right to do it, without a reason if they desire, but look up any of my posts (they are all through this forum on a variety of subjects), they are mostly asking for advice about ingame situations, or relating my personal experience with game mechanics or problems. I NEVER have sent Sobe or Aidon any direct threads, posts, PM or anything else, but I still agree with them, even more so now.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
If you think by whinning and crying about EVERYTHING is integrity, YOU look it up. You thought it was cleaver to create another account just to continue this thread, for your own self serving idealisms...good luck bro, have fun, keep up the work. To bad it's only worth reading for the humor it provides.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
You can try to bash me all you want, flame away big guy, you'll find I don't really care either. My point was made, for good or bad, so no big deal here, but my money says you'll be posting back here within 15 minutes with the &quot;Last Word&quot; again.&lt;BR&gt;<br />

The Unkept Druid section was created so that negativity didn't have to be banned.   It, just like other sections, serve their purpose only if you use them.  If you don't then why bother posting.</div></div><hr />
