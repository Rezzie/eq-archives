<br />
We are all getting a free respec, so which direction are you going? <br />
<br />
I've played with the tree build as well as the mangle build on the PTR and I'm actually pretty impressed with them both. <br />
<br />
I'm tempted to go with a 1/14/36 <br />
- Nature's Grasp <br />
<br />
- 5/5 Ferocity <br />
- 3/3 Feral Instinct <br />
- 2/2 Improved Bash <br />
- 1/1 Feral Charge <br />
<br />
- 5/5 Imp Mark <br />
- 5/5 Naturalist <br />
- 2/5 Subtlety <br />
- 3/3 Intensity <br />
- 1/1 Omen of Clarity <br />
- 5/5 Tranquil Spirit <br />
- 3/3 Imp Rejuv <br />
- 1/1 Naturew Swiftness <br />
- 5/5 Gift of Nature <br />
- 2/2 Empowered Touch <br />
- 3/3 Living Spirit <br />
- 1/1 Swiftmend <br />
<br />
Otherwise I'm going 0/41/10 and ripping the house down ( and healing my group in feral form zomgz ). <br />
<br />
So what about you guys?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't make alot of sense to implement the out of date trees if they're going to change again, and too many changes have been made since for them not to go through.<br />
<br />
At any rate, if Mangle stays as it is on the PTR(25% bleed bonus, no shred bonus), I'll just do a hybrid spec or something and get NS.<br />
<br />
Really tempted to do a 30/0/31 spec at 70 for arenas though...haven't quite figured out why, but I do...<br />

Probably gonna go with this, assuming that they make the patch talents match the beta ones (hopefully hopefully hopefully, I really want the the primal fury merge, bear form dodge w/feral swiftness, and bear extras, but we'll see).<br />
<br />
then I'll pick up OoC at 61, pop a couple points into natural shapeshifter, grab NG, finish predatory instincts, primal tenacity, and.. not sure about the rest, still debating between getting 2 points in natural shapeshifter and either grabbing brutal impact for pvp or shredding attacks... kinda wanna see how lacerate plays off first, I think.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if Mangle also increases the bleed effects from rogue abilities in BGs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LieutenantKettch</div><div class="date">12-11-2006, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it does....any bleed effect so it should affect rend and deep wounds as well. I'm not really sure if it's intended or not, but each mangle from each druid stacks regardless of which one it is...<br />
<br />
I was in AV and we were killing Vanndar, I think there were 4-5 feral druids attacking him, he had quite a few mangles stacked on him, my rip was ticking over 400, was good stuff.</div></div><hr />

ILotP = 5% crit to party plus 6% base hp heals every 6 sec (procs ALOT)<br />
<br />
NI = man, dont know if this is a mistake but I have 100% strength increase to +heal for 6 sec after shift (not 50%)<br />
<br />
Mangle = Rogue will suck your ____ for this as all bleeds get the +25% so we were stacking 6 bleeds on 1 target (looks like water flowing out of a glass it drops so damn fast).<br />
<br />
DPS = you WILL be #1 or #2 on the dmg meter, period. Prowl, Ravage, Mangle, Rake, Mangle, Mangle, FB FTW!<br />
<br />
I had every class amazed at the new skills of a druid. Before I got &quot;oh, feral, we'll see if there is a slot still open&quot; to now I get &quot;com'on man you know you wanna go , blah blah blah&quot; from like 5 different peeps. Ferals will be very popular. Priests/Restos love you because everyone is healing themselves, All for the added crits, Rogues/Hunter for the bleeds.<br />

Its a good day to be Feral again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
While Imp LotP is nice, it procs a MAX of once every 6 sec after a crit and it a 6% of the players max health.  Assuming that 5k is the average HP of the players in your group, that's a max for a 300 heal every 6 seconds.  In about 4 weeks the % drops from 6% to 4% making it an almost iffy talent healing for 200hp at a MAX of every 6 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been full pve tank spec since the patch -- 0/41/10. We've stopped raiding for the holidays now, so I'll be going 1/41/9 pvp spec until we start again. ^^<br />
<br />
I must say, ILotP is very, very good in a tank spec. I figured it'd be handy, but at 6% now it's almost overpowered. When I *tank* (i.e. when I take a lot of damage) on boss fights and trash we've got on farm in BWL, AQ40 and Nax, I heal myself for about 10% of the damage I take, after substracting overhealing. That's pretty imba tbh, and I can see why they reduce it to 4% in the next patch.<br />
<br />
It does work on npcs in your group as well. E.g. on Razuvious fight in Nax, stick a feral with ILotP in the priest mind control group, and grin as you see the understudies heal themselves (they healed over 120k from my aura in one fight -- not close to a full healer doing just healing, but very nice for a bear that was tanking at the same time.) For the same reason, don't use it in fights where you get mind controlled. Watching the boss regen from 5% to 11% while you're mind controlled, can't be very fun. :-&lt; (Not happened to me, but have spoken to people who had it happen.)<br />
