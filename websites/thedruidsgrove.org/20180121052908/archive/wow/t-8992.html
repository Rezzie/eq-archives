One guy &quot;Loro&quot; or &quot;lozo&quot; or something CAN be hard if you dont keep killing the totems he puts out as quick as possible as thet spawn alts very rabidly. But just bring a rogue pal around and things will get much easier.<br />
<br />
I think I've killed all 5 of them about 20 times now and atalai spoulders havev't dropped ONCE.. EVER! :(</div></div><hr />

Gasher I think is not able to be soloed.  I kill all three and usually a few guards outside the instance for the drop chance.  Money wise, depending on the drops, I can farm out a few gold in about 20 minutes or so, then get a friend to invite you to a group and reset the instance.  I spent a few weeks on and off before I got my shoulders, I was going for eagle, but stamina dropped, so that's ok for pure sta/armor build.<br />
<br />
Overall, I still do it, it's fun to try out different tactics on the different classes.  My armor is now up to 9300, might take another swing at gasher, see if I can handle him now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ukator</div><div class="date">06-20-2005, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went today to try it out. Was fighting Majin or something for 20 minutes or so. I couldn't kill him fast enough. I would get him down to 30 or so, my bash was gone, and he would heal up and drop a totem. This kept going, he would run low of mana then would just do enough to live till he could heal again. I take it Feral charge might help in this area?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazikeen</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The three I do not have listed are really not viable to solo as a druid, in gashers case, his dps is over 225 and his attack speed is such, you won't get a heal off likely if you SS to cast.  The other two not listed, majin and zolor(I think that's his name) both drop totems, you don't have the armor to handle him in caster and drop low level moons on the totems, and you don't have to dps to counter his dropped totems, so they are out as well.  Stick with the three I have listed, catch a few outside the instance in the corner spots for a chance at a decent drop, reset the instance and have fun :)  My friends think I am nutz, but as I stated, the money is generally good out of the drops, it's fast, I can always find a sub level 10 to group with me to reset as needed, and as I'm so familiar with the fights now, I can really stretch out and push my toon to the edge finding different ways to fight the different styles.<br />
<br />
Still going to get back to try gasher one day, got my armor up to 9400 now and another 100ish hp, have to see if that's enough to survive him long enough to drop'em. :)</div></div><hr />

I was feeling a little down after that fight:) I'll try to locate the other guys and see what I can do. Starting my CoWarding, Warden Staff funds so any money/items that drop on the way to these shoulders will be used.</div></div><hr />

Hukku attack sequence;<br />
full mana/health/thorns<br />
SF/FF/MF/Rejuv drop to bear and take him to far side of center (depending on where he spawns (as viewed as a clock in the instance) there is a chance the little imp can bring adds, the far corner from the hall prevents this)<br />
<br />
Build up rage to about 80,(demoralizing roar as needed) swipe (you'll have the succubus/blue guy in range) holding 80 rage till hit about 2500hp, then I bear regen.<br />
<br />
stun hukku/SS now it get's busy, pop off a regrowth/rejuv, refresh FF/MF hukku.  Now I shift to his lock adds, I DoT the blue guy, the succubus and the imp if he's not ran down the hall where I can't see him.  I also pop off my Rammstiens at this point.  Hit innervate, drop another MF on Hukku Rejuv and back to bear.<br />
<br />
Now the succubus will drop pretty quickly after this so I usually start spending my rage points on focused attacks on hukku, bout over now.<br />
<br />
Hukku drops, I SS back to caster MF the blue guy (imp again if I can catch him) rejuv then melee down the blue fellow (he's pretty hurt now)  A wrath or MF will usually drop the imp at this point.  Do not chase him if you head to close to the hall you will allow him to go further out and possibly catch adds.  <br />
<br />
Rest up peek to the balconies left and right and find which way to go next :)  <br />
<br />
BTW, I've ran this and pulled nothing but a few coin and 3 troll sweat, and I've run it and pulled 3 blues.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ukator</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do all of them heal themselves or just the guy I tried? Majin</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cenaurius, :) it's on my schedule this weekend, gonna test out this new build.  I've really been tweaking my tank build to a more stat oriented setup, not only have I upped my armor significantly through working instances, but the preferred items have created more of a hybrid, I'm realizing a substantial amount more dodges and such which results in much less healing/damage taken than the extra 1000 armor I've picked up as late would suggest ;) live and learn eh? LOL<br />
<br />
BTW, my friends are learning to use the druid so much better now and that's in guild.  I am a highly preferred stealth tank at this time and even talked a very good stealth team into trying whyrmkin yesterday, and WOOT we did it without a single person dieing until after whyrm dropped and the adds were there.  What a drop, I got my trindlehaven, another got the bloodstone, one got a nice pair of gloves, and the other got a disenchant item.  That afternoon I tanked each boss in DM east, was even sacrificed by Thornhoof without wiping. What a blast.<br />
<br />
Then later that night, had a pally buddy tell me, they lost their warrior half through scholo, knew I was interested and heck yea, went up there, buffed with my pally, I was carrying 10,400 nad 6300 hp! wow, the only bad thing of the whole main tank duty in scholo, was hurting the feelings of the other pally who really wanted to tank and caused the group some solid problems by pulling so often when asked not to :P<br />
<br />
I've tanked some solid stuff, but whyrm, the headmaster, and the butcher now are my highlights as a main tank.  Anyone who ever says a druid, properly equipped and comfortable with the class can not MT is frankly, nothing more than ignorant.  I did very well, keeping the vast majority of aggro when allowed, only losing it to the occasional pally who would not allow me to generate any hate initially.  I pulled aggro off cloth consistently and predictably and never lost my priest except for that dang room from hell that mages dread so :P  I ended the scholo run #5 on the damage meter, below 2 mages (expected) 2 rogues (expected) and one of the 2 pallies (near equal)  On damage recieved I exceeded the paladin primary by 17% over the run, which from my viewpoint and watching MT warriors, is just about flat out EXACTLY what a MT numbers should be at or near :)<br />
<br />
Not giving up my Healbot routine, especially not that my AI/MOW/FORT caster set is holding 6700 mana and 4100 HP.  But wow, what other class has the diversity to do what the druid class can do!!<br />
<br />
peace :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrax</div><div class="date">06-24-2005, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I soloed all but the one that does the totems that summon skeletons tonight at level 57.  The one that heals took 25 minutes to kill.  I am serious, I had thorns fade on me twice and I buffed it right before attacking.  Stats are 4500hps in bear form and 6500ac.<br />
<br />
The way I did it was I always buff up, cat form, fill up energy and open with it.  On most of them I get like 3 combo points and then Rip.  Swap to caster form, warstomp and heal, maybe moonfire, then bear form and tank.  Usually have to swap out a time or two.<br />
<br />
On the one with the 3 pets, I did something slightly different.  I opened on the imp and killed him asap before fighting the troll.  Why?  Because I have the worst luck resisting spells so the fireball chews through me at 57.  Overall, kinda easy but out of the mobs I killed I got a grand total of 2g worth of drops :(  Anyways, best of luck to all and give it a try.  I am going back soon till i get the shoulders in defense or bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">06-27-2005, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also decided to try this the other night. The shaman is just not worth killing, as everyone mentions. Took me just under 20 mins to kill him in a very long, frustrating fight. Couple times I almost had him, but he would get a heal off and it was almost like starting over. Think I killed a total of about 10 trolls so far and nothing to show for it yet. Think I will just spend a night resetting it over and over and just taking out the easy ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">11-30-2005, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 5 months later and I finally got my Atal'ai Spaulders of the Monkey (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=8293)<br />
<br />
Was helping a rogue friend of mine to finish a quest there,  so before we duoed Morphaz/Hazzas we did a quick sweep of the trolls, dropped on the first one we killed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Received Atal'ai breastplate of intellect, two sets of gloves, three sets of boots, codex of fortitude, and a rifle schematic in additional to the junk drops.<br />
<br />
So I've either got a bad luck streak or the spaulders are very rare, so will give up and concentrate on other options.  If anyone has got recommendations that can be fairly easily obtained.</div></div><hr />

So. . .assuming you would settle for Stam, Str, Bear, or Monkey, you have a 4% chance of getting these.</div></div><hr />
