<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As most of you know the forums are becoming less and less active. I would like to stick with it for a 10 year (1 decade) uptime April '09 but w/o the donations that used to be and w/o the support that we used to have. I am looking for a place for very low cost to keep the forums running w/o paying as much as we are now. Right now we are running at $213.00 a month, I am looking for a server that will cost right around 10-15% of this cost, many will have suggestions but its the &quot;Transfer&quot; over to this server that is cause for concern at this point. Hopefully I can get a couple PHP guru's to look and see if they can transfer it over. I certainly do not have the knowledge to do this.<br />
 <br />
I will also be putting ad's on the boards to offset the cost out of my pocket. I did a test on the Priest haven forums and over the last year it returned right around 23.00 for that time period and that means it pays for 1 month on the server we move to over a period of a year.<br />
 <br />
I do not want to shut down TDG nor I think those that are still here and those that may join our community would like. I am also going to make a couple calls to some of the sites I used to work with and see what they have done.<br />
 <br />
Any Suggestions Please Post them.<br />
If Someone that like to help please contact me via PM, phone talk will be required to &quot;verify&quot; his/her knowledge.<br />
 <br />
Thank you,<br />

This will yield longer wait times for access to the site. I'm also looking at closing some of our sister sites and merging everything here.<br />
<br />
After months of trying to find a fix to our funding woes, downgrading service is the only way The Druids Grove will remain open. If this downgrade is too small for our needs, the site will close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(On second thought, perhaps I should reserve judgement until I try browsing at peak hours.)</div></div><hr />

I am just hoping for the best.</div></div><hr />
