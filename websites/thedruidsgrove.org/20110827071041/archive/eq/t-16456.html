<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
SoF items with Improved Parry as a caster only item.<br />
<br />
This is not to change focii, this is simply to remove them altogther.<br />
<br />
Items which are shared (Tier 2 Leather Armor) etc will retain the Poison Focus because of it's use to Beastlords, which can wear that armor.<br />
<br />
If you can come up with anything else, let me know.<br />

I think that Fenier wants examples of what if not useable. Faerune is quite usable. You are calling it's necessity into question, not our ability to use it.</div></div><hr />

Also the various melee focii that are not class relevant (again, usually aimed at monks and beastlords.)<br />
<br />
Splitting ben/det spell range and preservation was always pointless; I can see the justification for a split in haste given the difference in power at the higher end.  however, the range items are the same (and hardly all that powerful to be begin with), ditto mana pres.</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
Why is SOE wasting their time on this?  If my armor has Sharpshooting III on it, it is useless but unless they are going to replace it with something I can use, who cares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">12-12-2007, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the case of something like Improved Parry, then there is a good chance it would get replaced with something that would be useful to at least one of the classes listed on the armor.  Improved Parry is meant to be useful.<br />
<br />
Faerune is a different story; the developers do not consider Faerune to have much value (and rightly so), so it's added on as a freebie.  Don't expect that to get replaced with something more useful.</div></div><hr />
