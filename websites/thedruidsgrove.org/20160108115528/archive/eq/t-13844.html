<br />
And yes, the 69.1 mission is great.  I did them on Hard.  You can either root rot the drachnids or kite them.  I find it's easier to kite them, but thats just me and my foci :P  It's very rewarding on hard, but do stay out of their range.  1300+, and I've been quadded before.  Ouch.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you can get the spawn pattern down to memory, the normal Nest is awesome.  You can do the undead side right next to the zone in.  Yeah, with the yellow/red cons.  It's a necro's playground, but if you find it empty, use it.  they hit hard and you'll need to get the hang of the spawn pattern and what aggroes what, but single pulling is cake once you know the aggro ranges.  You can kite the things down the bridge and around the zone in, but be careful not to get close to the other drakes.</div></div><hr />

Dotting might be a little more mana intensive, but it brings them down quicker.<br />

Rain spells hit in strange ways:<br />
1 target - 3 waves<br />
2 targets - 2 waves<br />
3-4 targets - 1 wave</div></div><hr />

One great thing is you can slow down your mana useage while soloing if you want to.  I've had quads there that I've ended at 90% mana because I didn't go fullout burn on them.  Then again I've also had quads that I've gone through the better part of my mana pool as well because I was alternating Karana's Rage and TW while trying to keep dots on the 4 mobs as well.  Largely depends on the speed you want to kill with.  It's possible to burn through your whole mana pool, but also clear the mobs around tables and have time to med it all back before repops (they're fairly long).</div></div><hr />

Yes.. they can also log off. The only thing they can't do is remove themselves from task, which happens if they want to do a mission of their own. Yesterday I did one with my alt and my friend's alt.</div></div><hr />

It wasnt that bad,  i'll squeeze one in tomorrow and get a exact number,  but its more interesting then Fire which made my eyes bleed.  Personally I do the nest instances for the drops as well,  killing 2 birds with 1 stone.</div></div><hr />

The nest is DoN expansion,  the non instanced isnt bad you can do the yellow conned corrupted/tainted/fallen drakes up the ramp for about 14% a kill,  the only pain is the cleric who CH's alot and gates,  the rest are fairly easy.  I 3 box so I do a instanced version where the drakes who drop tradeskill stuff are yellow conned (they are blue in non instanced).<br />
 <br />
You still hve to zone a bit (egress :texla: ) during splits,  but once they are split first time its just pure and fairly easy farming.</div></div><hr />

I found Stillmoon temple, and thundercrest, plus many instanced zone in areas but no nest.  Could someone give me the general direction and maybe some type of landmark to look for, it doesnt appear to be on my map.<br />
I tried to do some root/rotting in the Hive but those spiders break root alot and when they hit me I end up dead :shuffle: They also seem to add on me alot. <br />
I don't have any expansions past Dod btw.<br />
Thanks for any help :elfbiggri</div></div><hr />

To get singles in the Hive, pull with a snare and evac if you get an add. By the time you run back to your mob it will still be standing alone ready to be killed.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
In the non-instanced zone, quick evac really helps. There are only two Drakes that are in assist range of each other. These are easily split by snaring one and evacing. Then its just root rot ad-nauseum.<br />
 <br />
As far as gating mobs, the best thing is to get your HP above 7500 or so, then most caster mobs will go snare dumb before gating - it also helps to fire in a big nuke at around 20% health.<br />
 <br />
Biggest problem has been the pathing fix they made a few months ago. Folks heading back into the caves will pull the platform drakes off the edge and they fall into the pit and get stuck. They used to warp back to the platform, but not anymore. So you may get to the Nest and only have 2 or 3 mobs left on the platform. Its easy enough to just go deeper into the caves and kill the hall wanders, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">malibu66</div><div class="date">11-16-2006, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, one other thing. The non-instanced mobs are noticably easier than the instanced mobs. The instanced drakes have way better drops, and definitely more mobs to chose from, but they are a bit faster (near FoE speed) and hit 200-300 hp harder. IIRC, the instanced Drakes get 5 swings in the 1400+ ish range. Non-instanced drakes hit in the 1100 range.</div></div><hr />
