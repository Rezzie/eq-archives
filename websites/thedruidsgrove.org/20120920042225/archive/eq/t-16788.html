 <br />
1. AA Atk/AC debuff, probably 3 levels worth 3/6/9 and available at level 75/80/85 or something to that effect with ATK debuff of 175/225/275 and AC 30/50/70 or something near those numbers recast of like 30 seconds cast time 1-3 seconds is what i would wish to have<br />
 <br />
2. An AA that allows druids to cast outdoor only spells indoors or anywhere, available at like level 65 or 70 or something around there for about 9-12 AAs I think would be reasonable.<br />
 <br />
3. An AA that guarantees charm/root to last 10%/25%/50% of its supposed duration should be worth 3/6/9 again and available at levels 70/75/80 or something in that region.<br />
 <br />
4. An AA or some update to allow us to see when charm/root will drop as there is one for non fixed invisy which would give you 5-10 seconds to react to this information.<br />
 <br />
5. An AA similar to persistant casting where you can continue casting through a stun, but instead of stun be a summon or perhaps melee push because interuption from those two things often kill druids such as myself. Make this worth 3/6/9 AAs and available again at 65/70/75ish.<br />
 <br />
6. VP or something similar to it, a nice knockback rarely resisted root with more push than Spore spiral make that worth like 6-9AAs<br />
 <br />
Tell me what you think about these ideas, I would love to see any one of these implimented in the next expansion or some suprise update!</div></div><hr />

and an AA per level after that.<br />
<br />
I would also would like to see dire charm have its level increase costing us an AA per level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oakdad</div><div class="date">08-04-2008, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about some AAs to incorporate those stances they said we where getting.</div></div><hr />

While this doesnt increase our dps/healing ability it allows us to sustain it longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1. An awesome idea we have constantly been asking for.<br />
#2. Is a nice idea, though i cant think of too many spells i would use this for.<br />
#3. Yes please. tired of root landing and breaking the very next second.<br />
#4. If they give us 3, ill gladly give this one up.<br />
#5. Yeah cast through summon would be nice, melee push i can understand not being given.<br />
#6. Hell i would settle for Spore Spiral having a bigger knockback and cast range.</div></div><hr />
