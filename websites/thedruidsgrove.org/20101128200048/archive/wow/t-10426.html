It does not drop off mobs, it's the result of  quest that requires you to turn in your wildheart.<br />

<br />
You need Wildheart to get Feralheart.  They are all turn-in quests.  Expensive, and difficult ( 45 min Barron run?!?! *curses* ) but quests none the less.<br />
<br />
Ok upping you armor in bear - if you're tanking you may want the thick hide, short of that it is all equip and enchants.  So here's a quick breakdown.<br />
<br />
- Weapon: Warden Staff ( 260 AC +11 stam, get a +str enchant ) http://www.thottbot.com/?i=12314<br />
<br />
- Cloak: Cloak of Warding ( 214 AC, get the +70 ac enchant or the +5 al resists ) http://www.thottbot.com/?i=35977<br />
<br />
- Shoulders: Atal'Ai Spaulders of the Bear ( 193 ac 12-13 str 12-13 stam ) http://www.thottbot.com/?i=3866<br />
<br />
- trinket: Mark of Tyranny ( 180 AC +10 Arcane Resist ) http://www.thottbot.com/?i=13103<br />
<br />
That should help you out GREATLY</div></div><hr />

AB faction armor<br />
ZG Animist Gear<br />
Slaghide Gauntlets of X, from BRD<br />
Ring of Protection<br />
Tortise Band<br />
<br />
The only good AC gear I've seen in MC is the Dark Iron Ring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balzinn</div><div class="date">04-12-2006, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually, I'm lazy and forgot both to subtract out 2x agility  before multiplying and also forgot the profile was associated with my talent set and the 10% for thick hide was already applied.  It's still like 11,500 as is, which is getting close to just 12,000 with only mark.  If you tossed exalted AB shoulders on there you'd prob do it with no raid loot.  Just didn't think the exalted AB grind was a reasonable recommendation for someone of unknown playtime =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-12-2006, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AB faction isn't that hard to grind.  The games are short, win or lose you get faction gains and it goes quickly.  I just wish I could get my AV faction as quickly *sigh*  1/2 way to exalted now though :)<br />
<br />
AB is next on the grind list, though I don't get anywhere near the satisfaction of winning AB as I do when we down the general in AV.  Healing the tanking and dots on Derk.  Just a much bigger feeling of accomplishment IMO.</div></div><hr />
