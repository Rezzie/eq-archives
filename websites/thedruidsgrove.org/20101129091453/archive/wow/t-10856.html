I was looking for information on some of the professions (like what recipes were from the trainer and vendor, etc...) and so I thought I would link this to you guys.<br />
<br />
It's pdf's for many of the professions in a spreadsheet format.  It basically lists the skill level required to learn it, the level you have to be, and the mats needed.  <br />
<br />
Just wanted to pass on some helpful info to you guys!<br />

I do know some who are working on it....I'll see if they know good places to farm for leather quick to up LW.<br />
<br />
Other than that....I would check Thottbot to see what creatures give the types of leather you need and just grind there for a little while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get Herbalism and Alchemey/Enchanting as your two professions. Leather Workers dont make money. And I wish I would have gotten Herbalism so I could farm my own mats for Mana pots.</div></div><hr />

I think I like the thought of alchemy vs. enchanting.  So I will probably take you up on that.  Any general suggestions for alchemy (in terms of money making)?</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine does well with LW and Enchanting, he skins on an alt to supply leather then makes gear of the appropriate level for the mats he needs and DEs them for essences and what not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanting can make you tons of money and you dont need mats. Just get the recipes and then shout in a big city that you are enchanting and its bring your own mats + tip.<br />
<br />
Alchemey, you can make a ton of money with any resistance potions and major mana/health pots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barbooha</div><div class="date">07-19-2006, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Belle,<br />
<br />
I imagine Alchemy is like enchanting where the money comes at the end of the leveling process.  I will train it tonite.<br />
<br />
I would rather sell pots in the ah then spam my &quot;will enchant for tips&quot; macro. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">07-19-2006, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever floats your boat. I have enchanting guild mates that make well over 200g a day enchanting higher end stuff. And they just do the enchant, they dont provide mats, they dont farm, they just bring their rod and shout in Orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-19-2006, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem.  I like Alchemy...I've done both Alchemy and Enchanting on different 60s.  <br />
<br />
Although the lower mana and health pots don't sell too well....you can work on Swiftness Potion if you are lucky enough to get that drop (or find it for a decent price).  PvPers love Swiftness Potion, especially the lower level twinks.<br />
<br />
Don't get discouraged if your pots don't sell right away....it is towards the end where you start to see a bigger need for the pots (especially the resistance pots).<br />
<br />
Good luck!  (and I think the link above is pretty good for showing you what herbs to pick and all....I'll link another post from WoW forums that tells where to find a majority of the herbs when I find it - saw it last night)</div></div><hr />

Just buy a crystal, transmute it and sell the bar in the AH, every 2 days I make 6-7g without going to any more effort than that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">07-21-2006, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good trick that used to make more money on my server than it currently does (damn farmers) is to Transmute water -&gt; air <br />
<br />
You can get this transmute from the Scholo quest line that gives you the Spectral Essence, allowing you talk to the ghost vendors.  The vendor is the same one that you buy the major mana pot recipie from.  <br />
<br />
I used to buy Essence of water for like 6-8g, transmute it to air, then sell the essence of air for like 14-17g.  Cooldown on this transmute is only 1 day, not 2.  So that was like 8-10g per day, depending.  Though recently there have been tons of people farming essence of air in Silithus, which have pushed the air prices down to like 10g.  Now that the air market is flooded, I just transmute Undeath (1g) to Water, which I sell for about 6 to 8g.</div></div><hr />
