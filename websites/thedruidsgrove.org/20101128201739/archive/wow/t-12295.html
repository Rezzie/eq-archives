<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feral is probably the fastest way to level.  <br />
<br />
If you opt for feral, practice your tanking as much as possible.  Any druid can DpS, but tanking, IMO, is probably the most important aspect of raiding, the tank will either make or break a raid.  If you become a good tank, you will be very, very popular.  Lots of great tanking tips available here in the Grove.  <br />
<br />
While leveling, even as feral, you will probably have to heal every once in a while.  Give it a try for practice.  A feral druid can heal &quot;pre-outland&quot; instances quite competently.  <br />
<br />
Finally, if you find that you prefer healing over tanking, once you hit 70 and finish ALL of your Outland quests, you may decide to re-spec to Resto.  Whether it be on a battleground or in a Raid, there is always room for a Druid healer.  People LOVE our HoT's.  Nothing compliments a great tank better than a great healer. :thumbsup: <br />
<br />
Sorry, can't add much for balance, never done it.  Although, balance abilities are a riot on the battleground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
reading in this forum it seems to me that feral is best to start.<br />
<br />
so i will start down that path <br />
<br />
eventually i will start going down the path of pvp i love pvp with my lock but find druids hard to contend lol<br />
<br />
but for now i just want to enjoy playing my druid as i find (evan at lvl 8) they are lots of fun :thumbsup: <br />
<br />
thanks agian for your post</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say this because I've read posts from people who didn't attempt their Aquatic form until much later in the game, and the quest was no longer available for them.<br />
<br />
The quest itself is a trek, but it's very worth it.  <br />
<br />
And, yes!  Druids rule!  My Druid was my first character ever, and I rather ruined it for myself (when it comes to other toons) having started out with the best.  IMO, nothing is as fun or versatile as a druid.  ;)</div></div><hr />

They involve a lot of running around, but it's not hard, and you can pick up several flight points along the way that you'll be glad you got later.<br />
<br />
Also, you'll want to pick up (at lvl 14) the quest chain that results in the Cure Poison spell.</div></div><hr />

Same here. When WoW first came out only reason I waned to be a druid was because I thought shapeshifting into cats and bears was sweet. Now I'm a restoration druid, and I've played every other calss at least up to 30 and I still love my druid.<br />
<br />
If you're going to level feral, Look for gear that has +strength, +Stam, +Agility. In that order, in my opinion. Like I said I'm resto so maybe a feral can direct you a little better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croh</div><div class="date">01-04-2008, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have to agree with Magellan, the sheer versatility of a druid is awesome....bar none. I'm a level 41 and feral specced and have to say, I'm having SO much more fun than my 70 'lock. Have a few alts ....paladin, priest, mage and rogue , but rolling a druid is like having all that plus a tank in one. Just had to sound off a bit!<br />
<br />
Great place here for all stuff druid. Lotsa info. <br />
<br />
Take care all.</div></div><hr />

LOL - Me too!  My daughter and I purchased WoW without knowing anything about it - AT ALL.  We installed the game, watched the Cinematic Trailer.  We watched the female Night Elf jump through the forest and morph into a cat and it was all over :smile5:   Hellooo Druidism!  I was hooked.<br />
<br />
I leveled Feral smiling all the way.  Being a much better healer than a tank, I've since re-specced to a raiding Resto Tree.  <br />
<br />
Although, I've lost my &quot;grrrr&quot; (my husband watches me play and makes fun of me every time get smacked around on a battleground :rolleyes:) I am ALWAYS the first to get a spot in a raid.  And, THAT my friends, makes it worth while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Especially in BGs it's like you're controlling which DPS you want to stay alive and they do all the dirty work...it's like they're your henchmen =)<br />
<br />
But on my server....finding tanks for 5mans/heroics is much harder than finding a healer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">01-09-2008, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But on my server....finding tanks for 5mans/heroics is much harder than finding a healer... Not just your server. Game-wide. And once you've found a tank? Then you're still going to wipe, because it's a goddamn fury war who went from 1 to 70 without tanking once and has no idea how to hold aggro. You'll throw up one single heal - a hot, no less - and then it'll be like some weird fantasy porno, one hot elf in the middle of a half-dozen orcs. As you run back you'll try to be calm and convince him that, yes, if he's going to tank, he should probably have thunder clap and cleave and sunder on his axshun bur, and maybe even switch into defensive stance. Will he? No. Will he actually use any of those skills? No. And you'll wipe again and again and shake your fist at the Heavens, in view of a callous God.<br />
<br />
Sure, we need tanks. But we need tanks who know wtf they're doing even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">overlord</div><div class="date">01-09-2008, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol i understand that even at low lvl,<br />
<br />
i am currently questing with a friend (human warrior) but he has no idea how to tank or keep aggro so i find that im tankng all the time in bear form lol (but i dont mind i like bieng a bear)<br />
<br />
but this dosent work that well for down time healing us both.<br />
<br />
thinking about it how would two druids get on lvling one feral one rest? that should work quite well. i might ask him to roll a druid with me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">01-09-2008, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I think the best way to level two druids is either both go feral (one dps and one tank) or Feral and Balance.  Even feral's can passably heal an instance up to the outland instances.  If you couple druids, one should dps (or both) and the other should be able to tank if need be.</div></div><hr />

Tru Dat. :thumbsup:<br />
<br />
A druid desiring to go resto, really doesn't need to actually spec to resto until much later in the game.  A &quot;healer at heart&quot; can do so as feral just fine pre-Outlands. Going resto beforehand, IMHO, is a sad waste of feral muscle.</div></div><hr />

Leveling is all about personal DPS.  The fringe specialized specs (holy priest, protection warrior, resto durid, etc.) should be ignored until end-game.</div></div><hr />
