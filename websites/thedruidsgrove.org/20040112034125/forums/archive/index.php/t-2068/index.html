<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jocund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have not been able to get back to the picnic tables in poFire without aggroing something in the courtyard.  I can get past the 2 guards at the entrance to the castle and the 2 that walk back and forth in front of them.  I now know not to take an immediate right or left after you pass through the arch since there are guys tucked away back there up against the inside wall.<br />
<br />
BUT, something aggroes me before I can get to the back ramp - usually I never see him - just his comment that he is going to kick my ass or he just whacks me 6 times in about 1 second. <br />
<br />
Can anyone describe to me please how to get back to the picnic table safely?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ewww, first make sure no nameds are up in the second castle,  if theres a named on the path to the picnic table it never works.<br />
<br />
Two all the mobs in the castle see invis, but have incredibly small aggro radius's.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, I invis across the field to the rock in front of the castle, I wait until the two wanderers have left the entrance.  As soon as their on a stable path, I run through the middle of the arch.<br />
<br />
Then I run a slightly curved path to the second arch to the picnic table area, you bear a little left around the platform of mobs so as not to aggro them, and slightly in front of the huts, mobs live in those huts and if you get too close, they aggro as well.  <br />
<br />
The mini nameds in here, if they are up, have a larger aggro radius and will make a pasty druid like substance of you fairly easily without good buffs and reactions.<br />
