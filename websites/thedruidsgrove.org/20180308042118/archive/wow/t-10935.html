Sorry for the Noob question but I've been a priest up until now and I've rolled a druid :)</div></div><hr />

Not even a contest in my mind. -5 rage/-5 energy for your main attack will serve you waaaaaaay better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kendali</div><div class="date">08-19-2006, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ferocity is better as an overall talent so take that if it's an either/or deal for your build. However, with 1.12 we get a new rank of FB and attack power will scale FB's damage.  With natural weapons 10% damage increase to melee attacks and feral aggression's 15% damage increase to FB...new ferocious bites in 1.12 will likely be critting for well over 2k (my max now with aggression has been over 1925). <br />
<br />
The parsing druids on the test server haven't had an easy time figuring out FB's ap scaling coefficient due to armor mitigations and low to high end variable damage on each combo point rank, but rip has been determined and it's quite impressive at 0.24AP = 1 damage.  Rip's damage is also scaled with attack power then multiplied by 110% for natural weapons talents so ~970 atk power can increase it's damage by 350ish.  It's really nice and if FB gets a similar scaling as well as a nice new rank....that's scaled base damage multiplied by 125% for nat weapons/feral aggression......it could be really amazing.<br />
