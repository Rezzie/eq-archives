I think I got it moved out of the thread, so it should be viewable again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't there any way to impose a waiting period with this board's software?  Limiting posts to users who have registered, say, a week ago, would prevent this nonsense.<br />
<br />
Maybe turn off HTML too, that may be how he's making the thread unviewable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-07-2008, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Removed the posts again.<br />
<br />
As for stopping it from happening, that's a question for Rahj.  My guess is it's something similar to that... maybe they're trying to embed malicious HTML and the server has something built in to stop that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't ban IPs, that's a Rahj or Sobe thing too. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">12-12-2008, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spammer is back (most recently under names jigogypekengact and KEEDAYet) and has killed the genocide thread again, as well as a couple of others on the board (see http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums/showthread.php?t=16985).  It might be some sort of bot as the pattern is always the same (registers under random name, alters profile to include all sorts of information, and kills the same thread over and over).<br />
<br />
If you look at the active user list, there are new accounts being registered almost constantly under the same random name pattern (currently mastrrrik, which will no doubt try to kill the thread again).<br />
<br />
Maybe prevent new registrations for a while, or something.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Tuda, for re-engaging me after all these months.</div></div><hr />

There are like 20+ guests at any given time and half of them are constantly registering.<br />
<br />
Also, this thread (http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums/showthread.php?t=5617) is still nuked, if a mod has a moment to fix it.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That one is strange... it doesn't look like a spammer caused it, as far as I can tell.  Seems like there is some sort of bug causing a thread not to render.  I can't tell exactly which post in the thread is doing it; I have to &quot;peel&quot; them off one by one until I find the culprit.</div></div><hr />
