Solowise, I can't think of any good quests... best bet is prolly to grind exp, and there's some good advice on how to do that in other threads =)</div></div><hr />

An easy shammy solo place is in WoS, you kill the names, you get loot for the alt. You kill trash, you get a chance of loot for the alt. You kill mobs, you get exp for the alt. Quest pieces are a plus, if either of the toons have the faction. You also get money from the loot that the alt doesn't need.</div></div><hr />

You could park your druid in UP and solo elysians on shaman.  However, I'ld just recommend getting ahold of hordes of DoN crystals and using them to buy the druid gear when he becomes a higher level.</div></div><hr />
