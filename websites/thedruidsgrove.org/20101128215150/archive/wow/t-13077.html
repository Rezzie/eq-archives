I took a 6 month break from wow and was looking over the new talent tree and was trying to figure out what I should aim for. I play mostly as a solo kitty, but do occasionally group up. Has anyone else had trouble fitting iLotP into your talent tree? How important do you think natural and master shapeshifter are? and should I put 2 points into iMotW and 3 points into furor or all 5 in furor? thanks for any suggestions<br />
<br />
Here are some of the builds I was looking at;<br />

I would also strive for ILoP too.  This sounds silly, but you will crit so much that you will only need to pop out and top off when you pulled too much.  (Can now bandage while shifted, so I do that more than healing myself)<br />
<br />
As for the shapeshifter...that is up to you.  Its really more of a playstyle than anything else.  I leveled all the way to 80 as kitty, and almost never shifted in combat, nor sat to drink because of low mana.  That being said I was before and am now back to being a full time Bear.  Kitty isn't my specialty.<br />
<br />
I would dump some points in R&amp;T to pickup IlotP and Imangle.  R&amp;T is really only viable in groups. By the time you get debuffs up and target stunned for positioning in order to shred, it will be dead unless you are in an instance.</div></div><hr />

Decided to go this route at least till I hit 80 and start grouping up<br />
