FF usage dropped by 8% while IE seems to have picked up the switchers.<br />
<br />
There seem to be plenty of opinions on the cause, including:<br />
-Security flaws showing that it's not free of such problems.<br />
-Excessive Memory use<br />
-Even, the fact that Mozzilla is now &quot;for profit&quot; (The announcement and decline were both in July)<br />
<br />
What is the cause?  Your guess is probably as good as anyone's.</div></div><hr />

Pfft. on the corrections :moon: <br />
<br />
I really haven't been paying attention to the browser wars myself.  After a bit of searching, I was suprised that there seem to be a fair amount of stability problems too.  Stability was one of the primary reasons I dropped Netscape for IE4 long ago.<br />
<br />
I've installed FF and played with it a bit in past, but, I never really used it.  While tabbed browsing is nice, it's not something I really use.  I usually don't have more than a few web pages open at once.  I also keep my PC patched and scan for any spyware, which I never get any of, so IE has been fine for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">08-15-2005, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fx is stable, quite stable for me. Sure I might have a crash here and there, but honestly it's no more than the crashs I had when I used IE as much as I use Fx. IE really doesn't like you clicking on 5 things almost instantainiously, where as I do it all the time in Fx (multiple tabs, etc).<br />
<br />
I think another factor if it's drop is what you mentioned earlier about Mozilla Inc being formed and people in a misconception that Fx will go commercial, like Opera, one day. This isn't the case, but no point in trying to convience the world. They'll find out, soon enough, that Fx will never be a commercial browser.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, the old advantages of using FF are disappearing.<br />

Slow to start up now.<br />
Popups now, or popunders whatever.<br />
Sploitable now.<br />

One thing yet to succumb to is those incessant toolbar crap things that IE gets.  I go over to a friends house or something, open up their IE and they got 6 layers of nested toolbar crap spyware crap engine crap on their machines.</div></div><hr />

I know there's a command in about:config that will just disable any target=&quot;&quot; from poping up any new windows. This is extremely helpful since if I'm not middle clicking, I want the page to open in the current window.</div></div><hr />

If you use a scroll mouse, clicking the scroll wheel on a link opens the link up in a new tab. That's my favorite way of doing it.<br />

I converted many of the second hand machines we use at work (charitable org blah blah) to Firefox and - well it takes somewhere towards a full minute to start up and eats about 80% of the RAM (they have 64MB), rendering the machines unusable for things like printing out webpages with it or switching to another app. <br />
<br />
IE takes up next to nothing and starts up instantly.  IE wins, and I just started switching them back.<br />
<br />
Of course, at home I'm still using Firefox... 3GHz puter and 1GB of RAM is able to handle it... but I can see how it'd easily put off people with low spec machines or simply the speed/memory cautious.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, I have been using Firefox for the last 3 hours and it is currently using 24,280K. I just started up IE and it is using 20,900K. I stopped and started Firefox and it's now using  21,120K. All according to Windows Task Manager. Sure doesn't seem diffrent to me.</div></div><hr />

Of course, I set Firefox to open when my computer turns on, so maybe I just don't notice it.<br />
<br />
As far as going to IE, currently Firefox still has many features that far outweigh switching.  Tabbed browsing, plug-ins, and pop-up blockers are great.  I hear the next version of IE will have tabbed browsing (finally catching up?), but not sure if it'll have the others.  Really though, even though Firefox doesn't block pop-ups as well as it used to, it's no where near as bad as IE is.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I was going to switch browsers, I'd switch to Netscape.  The one downfall of Firefox seems to be sites that are made for IE, but Netscape has a feature that allows you to choose between Firefox and IE for how you want websites to show up.  If a site can't show up in one, it'll automatically switch to the other.</div></div><hr />

IE6's Pop up blocker works very well.  I rarely see any pop ups at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">08-16-2005, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firefox's share shrunk to 8.07% from 8.71% in June, while Internet Explorer grew its market slice to 87.2% in July from 86.56% last month.<br />
Hardly a big change.  Personally, I've gotten quite used to tabbed browsing, mouse gestures, and popup/Javascript control, and I don't use IE for anything other than the few sites that require it.  If the new version of IE provides ALL of these features, plus plugin ability, I might switch back to it.<br />
<br />
I also don't see the big deal with loading time.  Firefox loads on all of the systems I use in about 1 second, or faster if it's cached.  Maybe IE loads a few milliseconds faster, but who cares?  Or are you all using ancient computers?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the total browswer &quot;market&quot; no, it's less than 1% of a change and not even close to a big change.  But, it does represent an 8% reduction in FF's share, which is pretty significant.</div></div><hr />

Explorer.exe uses between 7 and 8MB on this machine (my work PC) at the moment.  I've read reports of FF eating up more than a 100MB after a while, so even at your 30+10 or 15, it can get worse on FF. But, I have to ask, if you don't use Explorer.exe, what do you use? Ending the that task also kills the basic windows GUI like the task bar.<br />
<br />
Btw, Opera is also about the only browser that can claim to be free of vulnarabilities.  It has a much better track record on security than any other browser.  That said, I tried it but don't use it.  It doesn't meet my needs.</div></div><hr />

For a theme, I use Non|Step II (http://nonstep.litestep.com/) theme on my primary system. Very nice, sleek and very useable. Litestep, however, comes with a very userfriendly theme by default.<br />

<br />
My problem with Opera is covolution. I used Opera 7.x series and it was extremely user-unfriendly and took quite a bit of work to get the browser even remotely as &quot;streem lined&quot; as Fx it by default. And to really do the nice works with Opera required extensive file text editing. I hadn't used the 8.x series myself, but I have installed it once and it was much more streemlined than it's predicessors.</div></div><hr />

On Windows 98?<br />
<br />
Both of the amounts I quoted were seen on our 64MB machines at work.  Windows 98 including explorer.exe and iexplore.exe sits in a mere corner of that :)  In fact I've had it running quite comfortably on 32MB systems...<br />
<br />
Java is a good point though.  I installed Java onto them to minimise compatibility issues, but I have heard of it doubling the RAM requirement of Firefox..</div></div><hr />

While this is so, its a price I'm willing to pay for the relative relief from the the constant adware/spyware the is seemingly inherent with IE.<br />

I can run seven to ten tabs in Firefox and the browser will bloat itself to 200+mb (as per taskman).  Meanwhile, the same instances of IE on the same pages is only around 40-50mb total.  I've seen this type of performance both on &quot;bland&quot; installs of Firefox (ie: no add-ons) and those with multiple extensions.
