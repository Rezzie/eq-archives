<br />
Not the new &quot;I look like a level 1 Black Wolf&quot; form, but the old, red eyed spirit wolf that I know many of us old School Druids absolutely loved having. Sure we couldn't look like we were sitting, but we looked different. In those days, seeing someone in Wolf form, was usually the sign of a &quot;high level&quot; (at the time) Druid.<br />
<br />
The attack bonus is really not useful to Druids. Mana regen on Form of the Howler was a nice idea, but it doesn't stack with the Mask line so it's pretty much useless.<br />
<br />
All in all, Wolf form was a unique Druid (and ranger) spell line, that just sort of died. Rangers still get some use out of it, but for Druid's it is pointless.<br />
<br />
What about making a high end spell, or AA ability, that would bring back that old Spirit wolf form, and allow it to give some sort of mana gain proc, similar to the Greatstaff of Power.<br />
<br />
Since we couldn't mount while in Wolf Form, the mana gain proc wouldn't really give us much over mounting. We would be able to more easily cancel spells, but as a downside, we would have to be in melee range/meleeing at all times, which is bad in some cases. I think it would be fairly balanced with mounting, but would give druids an actual reason to use wolf form in some situations. Could also bring back some of the faction changes with Wolf Form, allow it to make us non KoS to all animals? Not a massive change really, just something to give us a reason to use it, if only situational.<br />
<br />
Just a thought, from an old druid trying to bring back a spell line that should never have died, much like Firefist.. don't get me started on that pointless waste of spellbook space ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good luck getting anyone at Sony to care about wolf form.  I made an entire list of ways to fix it (with help from a number of people here).  They have ignored me, so if you get them to notice you, my best wishes to you.<br />
<br />
You see, being a wolf was fun, and we can't have that in EQ.</div></div><hr />

The major downside now is that you can't use a mount.  However, if they made a new wolf form that came with some mana regen and wouldn't let you sit, that would be cool.  It of course would have to stack with the mask line or at least be more mana than the mask line gives.<br />
<br />
I always thought it was a nice bit of balance between shammies and druids.  Shammies turn into bears and summon wolves.  Druids turn into wolves and summon bears.<br />
<br />
At the very least, I'd like to see an upgraded wolf form that lets me keep up with people who get the ssra/100k/etc horses.  Even if it's self only.  Not many people want to be wolves anyways.  The atk bonus is nice, but the graphics can mess with you if you're attacking.<br />
<br />
An interesting graphic would be nice, to distinguish it from the existing wolf forms.</div></div><hr />

Wolf form is KOS in almost every zone in the entire game, not just PoR zones.<br />
<br />
It is dead and Sony killed it deliberately for no reason and has ignored any attempts to talk about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't have something fun in EQ, kill off wolf form.&quot; - Sony</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be totally worthless in outdoor zones, because it wouldn't stack with a horse, and why would anyone bother losing 17 mana per tick when they could just sit on a horse and have mask of the wild on instead.</div></div><hr />

Druids have historically been faster than monks.  I don't see any reason why a new wolf form wouldn't be the same.  Isn't our fastest wolf form already faster than run8 anyways?  I seem to recall run8 being around 72% increase and our level 60 wolf form maxxes out at 75% (at level 70).</div></div><hr />

<br />
A druid in new tree form could add a slight mana/endurance regen aura for the group (like 5-8).  Tree form would severely snare us, but we could move some like treants.  And make it so it doesn't stack with our hp regen aura line for balance.  Would be either/or, whatever is needed most.  And we'd take a hit in FR too, lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jtoast</div><div class="date">04-06-2006, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wolf form and treeform were just plain fun spells.  <br />
 <br />
I remember casting treeform and lev and then spinning in circles while I cast my self buffs way back when to look like a decorated Christmas tree.  :D<br />
 <br />
Thats one of the reasons it's so hard for me to come back to the game...all the just plain fun stuff is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh you can still cast treeform..<br />
 <br />
I did it in Theatre of Blood. Illusion didn't take hold, but root did. So I was sitting on my horse, rooted, with no illusion and got no fcking clue why I can't move. The spell effect icon was similar to some other stuff and between other buffs, so I didn't notice it for a while.. almost evaced.<br />
 <br />
ToB got some more fun stuff... some mob ported us on random to ocean. So when I was moved to underwater while mounted and swam back up I couldn't get on mount again because &quot;you are alread mounted&quot;.. and I could not /dismount because.. well, dunno, it didn't work. Evac helped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wolf form can add much more than just run speed or mana regen, and it should. I would mostly just like to see Druids actually become druids again, and not just inefficient wizards/clerics.</div></div><hr />

I know SOE said they nerfed Wolf Form so that you can't cast it on people that are out of group, I disagree. It works just fine. I've often MGB'ed Wolf Form at main bank in PoK just for the fun of it, works just fine :)<br />
<br />
I still use Wolf Form on people when they're melee characters, and being PLed, since it's more ATK along with higher run speed.</div></div><hr />
