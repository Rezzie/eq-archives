Trayc is lvl 73 druid and never got her DoDH spells, is it worth it today to do the missions to get the spells?   Looks like to me the only spell in the set worth it is Reptile( am I wrong??).<br />

Thanks<br />

Spore spiral not so much. It's knockback isn't far enough to throw mobs out of hit range, and if you're like me saying &quot;%t is rooted, BACK OFF NOW!!!&quot; does jack sh*t to make your group back off from an add... Sort of the reason I thought spore spiral would be worth it. For me it takes 3-4 casts to move the mob out of range of whatever it is hitting, with the refresh time + cast time it's not worth it. Our other roots, save vinelash cascade (with shorter cast time though) also last longer. Only useful thing I have found for spore spiral is soloing in extremely tight quarters.</div></div><hr />

Its chromo resist check means it pretty much sticks on everything, everytime, first cast, never gets resisted, ever, never, ever.  Hands down the Crowned Prince of all our root spells.  I may use Vineclash on rare rare occasion when I'm prepared to scribe it in advance for some specific purpose.<br />
<br />
Reptile Skin is just like OMFG good.   I would be thrilled to see an upgrade to this one in the future, but alas I've come to accept that its likely one of those one-time-only deals like Dawnstrike.</div></div><hr />

Both hot and still useful. I'm similar to Tobynn in that if I root this is the one I mem. The knockback is tiny but it lands, and 99% of the time I don't even need the knockback part. I do miss when it used to make the mobs jump straight up in the air though - that was cool! Personally I haven't memmed dawnstrike in forever. That series is worth doing for the clicky (part of the clicky resist mask lines) though.<br />

Vinelash is good for the zerg - when you can't be bothered or are not able to split them and just pull multiples at once and dot them all up.</div></div><hr />

I still use Spiral as my primary root unless im trying to Pull nameds outta a train, (in which case i sporespiral all but the named after VCing them)<br />
dawnstrike ... not as good to me as EB or WF unless of course you want to keep casting and hoping for the proc..<br />

The Tart is done /wave at AKORAbutthead</div></div><hr />
