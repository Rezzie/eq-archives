I have both pendants. One from the Sludge Fen in the Barrens and the other off the coast of Silverpine. Now here is the problem. I can't get them to merge. How do I do this? I've gone to the moonglade and nothing. <br />

What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

One says it's missing it's aquatic counterpart. So I drag them on top of each other and nothing. Double clicking. Nothing. Right/left click. Nothing. I just don't get it? Is the one I found in sludge fen viable? I see mention off another coast on these boards. Do I have a fake one or did they move it with the last patch.<br />

I've owned wow all of 2 weeks so far. So I'm noobish.</div></div><hr />

Although I must admit the NPC was a little harder to find that I would have liked.  Just nose around and you should find him.</div></div><hr />

Although when I'm away from the shrine it says must be near shrine to do that. But at the shrine, nothing. Both items just keep switching places when I drop them on each other in my inventory.</div></div><hr />

Try dragging one onto the other and if that fails drag the opposite way round. I tried 3-4 times and then suddendly it worked.</div></div><hr />

Ixeos, if your referring to the cave with Furbolgs, that is Timbermaw alley.  They are aggressive to anyone they don't trust so stay clear if you don't want to die.  When your around 45'ish you can begin working on faction in Felwood to grant you access through the cave into Winterspring.  Faction witht them has more benefits as well, like some leatherworking patterns and a trinket of some sort.</div></div><hr />

I've done this multiple times. And yes at the shrine. I haven't done those other quests mentioned (shifting sands?). <br />
<br />
I did get the second pendant first though. Is this quest oder specific? I may just abandon it and restart it - if I can. What will happen if I do that? Will the pendants disapear? More important, do I have to go get them again?</div></div><hr />

I then turned that piece in and was told to speak with the people to learn of the locations of the pendent parts.  I then went to Silverpine, and then Barrens, returned to the shrine in Moonglade to click combine them.  Done.</div></div><hr />

Walk all around it till I was right between the tree and Remolus when it finally worked. Strange just strange.</div></div><hr />
