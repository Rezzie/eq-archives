DENVER • State Sen. Dave Schultheis was the lone &quot;no&quot; vote Wednesday on a bill requiring pregnant women to be tested for HIV so their babies can be treated to prevent the transfer of the virus if the mother tests positive.<br />
<br />
He explained that if the babies are born HIV-positive, they will teach society about the risks of promiscuous sex.<br />
<br />
&quot;This stems from sexual promiscuity for the most part, and I just can't go there,&quot; the Colorado Springs Republican said. &quot;We do things continually to remove the consequences of poor behavior, unacceptable behavior, quite frankly.&quot;<br />

<br />
First of all, why assume anyone with AIDS is promiscuous?  Perhaps they're in a monogamous relationship (or thought they were) and their partner is cheating?  Should they be punished for someone elses lapses?  Remember all the people infected by tainted blood?  Lets punish them and their children!  Lets punish people who were taking precautions but the precaution failed, like a broken or slipped condom.<br />
<br />
Republicans like to punish people who have sex because they must not be getting any themselves.</div></div><hr />

Yes, 'cause letting babies get HIV is the only way we can get that message across.  :rolleyes:  What a complete tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He said that AIDS stems from promiscuity (in general).  And that's true, at least in part.Perhaps they're in a monogamous relationship (or thought they were) and their partner is cheating?  Should they be punished for someone elses lapses?  Remember all the people infected by tainted blood?  Lets punish them and their children!  Lets punish people who were taking precautions but the precaution failed, like a broken or slipped condom.The odds of getting HIV from a blood transfusion today are near zero.  I don't know why your condom would be slipping, but even if it breaks or you have a problem one time, the odds of getting infected that one time are minimal.<br />
<br />
In reality, virtually all infections come from male anal sex, injection drug use, and high-risk heterosexual sex (having unprotected sex with prostitutes, or having unprotected sex with someone you know is infected).  HIV-infected women who breed irresponsibly also create a small number of HIV-infected babies.<br />
<br />
Promiscuity is no doubt part of this equation.  If gay men weren't screwing dozens of other gay men, and if prostitutes weren't screwing hundreds of men, the infection rate would be a lot less.  Of course it would be confined to drug users only if all men used a condom and all women took an HIV test before breeding and used antiretroviral drugs or aborted if they were pregnant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">02-27-2009, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an uncommon risk involved with mothers who are HIV positive, transferring the HIV virus to the infant gestating in the womb, and post pregnancy. It is pretty uncommon to pass it off naturally, during gestation as most infections occur post pregnancy during nursing. <br />
<br />
While they have found a cure for HIV, in early stages, but, not the later stages with  bone marrow from the 1-2% of the population that is already naturally immune to HIV anyways. That wold not cure all the cases of HIV anyways, and also good luck testing everyone to see if they are HIV immune, other such issues.<br />
<br />
Once again, abstinance only policy rears its ugly little head. With the comments like that perhaps he should approve of invitro only legislation and ban sexual intercourse altogether making it a criminal offense. Thus depriving people of their natural behaviors while at the same time, joining forces with those in Louisiana who passed legislation for castrating repeat sex offenders. That will teach them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Federal Law requires for the routes to exist and continue.  HIPAA was written explicitly to prevent insurance carriers from disallowing insurance to you based on pre-existing conditions, then the addendum for Privacy was added on to explicitly allow the transmission of HIV to others.<br />
<br />
HIPAA NO longer(never really did) prevent an insurance company from sharing information about you to another to DENY you coverage.<br />
<br />
But is sure does allow for the increased spread of HIV.<br />

More HIV people, the more MONEY that the healthcare industry makes.</div></div><hr />

You need to do more research.<br />
<br />
Your opinions are wrong here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyyr</div><div class="date">03-05-2009, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The CDC is wrong? <br />
The CDC has an agenda which is different than its mission statement.<br />
<br />
Are you surprised?<br />
<br />
For example in 1991, the CDC stated that MRSA was the Number 1 Emergent threat to healthcare.  In 1998 it completely stopped tracking MRSA cases.<br />
<br />
Whooping cough(pertussis) and chicken pox are notifiable diseases.  But HIV is no longer.<br />
<br />
Not only that but you have to really search hard, and read through all the medical double speak to find out that the CDC absolutely knows that MRSA, VRE, and VRSA were grown in HIV positive(GAY) men. For political agendas they mask the truth on transmission of disease.<br />
<br />
And even if they continue to mask the number one route of transmission of HIV, they have done NOTHING to help prevent the second most prevalent route.  It is unconscionable that they have not lobbied and advocated the legalization of sale of sterile needles to IV drug users.  If propitiating and exacerbating human death is evil, then the CDC in this regard is EVIL.  Of course, I know you will argue this point.  More human death means less humans, the better the planet will be, I'm sure you will argue.  Or some psuedo religious argument that they get what they deserve, or that they should have known better.<br />
<br />
No, the CDC is not 'wrong'.  There are Mustafa Monds up there, and they know the truth.  They just choose not to share it with you.<br />
<br />
It is no secret how to stop the spread of HIV.  The disease would be extinct for all practicable intents if the CDC followed the lead of prostitutes.  The p0rn industry, made up of the most promiscuous prostitutes on the planet have the lowest HIV rates of virtually any American population sample.  Why?  Why does a former p0rn queen, Dr. Sharon Mitchell, and AIM know how to stop HIV transmission in a given high risk(ostensibly the HIGHEST risk) population, yet the CDC can't do the same?  Because she is not a fvcking liar, that's why.  And she has nothing to gain when people contract or transmit HIV to others.  And she is not beholding to some GAY RIGHTs political agenda to stifle truth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny, I thought libertarians stood for personal responsibility, not governmental control and coddling.Whooping cough(pertussis) and chicken pox are notifiable diseases.Comparing HIV to these diseases is silly.<br />
<br />
I don't have to have sex with you or share a needle with you to get them, and I don't have a simple defense mechanism I can use against them.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, neither are long-term status diseases that lead to discrimination.<br />
<br />
Not comparable at all.</div></div><hr />

The CDC isnt worthless,  but they are not a bastion of goodness out for our common good,  only our good so long as it keeps them funded.<br />
 <br />
But our politicans are never wrong so obviously the CDC isnt either.</div></div><hr />

Of course it is not comparable.<br />
<br />
You have no idea what you are writing about, either.<br />
<br />
How can you discuss notifiable diseases, when it is rather clear that you don't know what they are?</div></div><hr />

How is chicken pox transmitted?<br />
<br />
How is pertussis transmitted?<br />

Other than vaccination or quarantine, how can I protect myself against such individuals?<br />

I am not talking about you.<br />
<br />
I am talking about removing the virus epidemiologically from the American population(500K+ Americans are carriers).  It could have happened already, if the known steps to eradicate it were taken for the last 25 years.<br />
<br />
And then we would not have much things to talk about on this subject, would we?<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, I understand your position on depopulation.  And 50 thousand Americans die from AIDS each year(or so).  But who cares, they are only Fags, druggies, and whores, and deserve to die anyway, right??.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If everyone took responsibility for themselves, we could wipe out the virus very easily.  HIV is unlike many other viruses, in that it's very easy to protect yourself.<br />
<br />
It is also unlike many other viruses in that it's both a chronic condition and carries a social stigma.<br />
<br />
All these factors make your comparisons to other, totally dissimilar diseases pointless.  HIV is NOT like those diseases and there is a very good reason we don't require HIV infected people to broadcast their health status but we do require people with highly infectious, rapidly progressing diseases to broadcast theirs.<br />
<br />
As for X people dying of AIDS every year, as I mentioned, it is now very easy to protect yourself.  If you don't want to protect yourself and you get infected and eventually die, that's your prerogative.  Just like wearing your seat belt, you know what to do, and if you're too lazy or stupid to do it, you've earned what's coming to you.<br />
<br />
Only thing is, I don't want to pay for your AIDS drugs and ER visits.  You should be required to pay that out of your own pocket, just as you should be required to pay for the consequences of any other stupid, voluntary action that's totally under your control.</div></div><hr />
