Is it possible to reach lvl 70 as a resto build? I have read as a resto there is not much dps, but the resto line seems like fun to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, i look forward to your responces.<br />

You can level with any spec you want.  The issue becomes how you fight your fights.  Most people recommend leveling using Feral because it amps up your damage potential. You gain skills and abilities to do damage quickly.  <br />
<br />
Caster/healing leather is not very well itemized in pre BC.  So if you want to have decent healing, it will be hard to come by before outland.  Its no different than leveling as a holy priest.  your damage potential will be a lot lower.  So what that translates to is that it will take you longer to kill mobs.  Healing yourself will be much much better, but overall its more of a struggle.  Your ranged damage options are  limited.  So you may find you are leveling using cat form non stop anyway.<br />
<br />
As bad as it sounds, Resto is really geared toward the instance and raid healer.  There are a few key talents in there, but overall, its kind of weak unless you plan on spamming instances.  If you do, its  a great spec to have.  <br />
<br />
Two most comon things seen in any all for a LFG -----<br />
a)  Need Tank<br />
b)  Need healer<br />
<br />
It is important to note that a full feral druid can heal any pre 70 instance.  it isn't as pretty as a holy priest, but you can do it.  I never hesistated to step into the healing role as a feral druid if I wanted to do an instance run.</div></div><hr />

You can infact level with any spec you want. Just it's most easiest to gear feral from 1-70 than any other spec(only because of rogue loot imo).</div></div><hr />

And Raided a while at 60 with it too<br />
<br />
when I hit 70 I played around and looked into the other specs since I couldn't solo a dam thing, both balance and feral specs are so much better off to solo with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All toons are natively overpowered enough that, even with a full resto build, you can still quest in zones a little over your current level.  Just get used to carrying some kitty gear too.  You'll be fine.<br />
<br />
I'd advise anyone leveling to spend a lot of time instancing as you level 60 - 70, and full resto build is well suited for this.  Why?  Because you'll hit 70 and still have a few zones' quests totally untouched... and you're going to need the gold.</div></div><hr />
