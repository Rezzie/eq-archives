<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can do stuff inside jail cells, lots of casters though, and guards assist.  Or can just do guards.  Rats too but they probably suck for exp since they're light blue at 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apocalypse Criterion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The first rats are LB at 59, the second layer ones are blue till at least 60.  Once you get Dire charm you can pretty much annihilate the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really, charm in PoJ causes some wierd agro that will probably kill you a few times.<br />
<br />
DC a rat, attack a prisoner, and you'll probably get about 8 of the wandering rats agro too, and then a jailer or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I actually had much luck soloing down in the jail.  I know the tricky agro you mean, but the location you decide to charm at can prevent that.<br />
<br />
At the last staircase leading down into the jail, where you can go right to enter the jail or left to go toward the caves with worms, rats path frequently past the closed door at the top of the stairs.  Simply wait there and DC one as it walks by, then walk him down the stairs to the jail.  If you do get agro deal with it on the staircase and you won't have any adds, just don't go to the base of the stairs or the high guardian inside the door will come rearrange your face.  (It should be noted that some of the pestilence rats that path by that door are too high to charm, they are few and far between however, I have rarely had more than 1 DC fail per trip there).<br />
<br />
Once you have your rat past the high guardians it's easy.  Use Harmony of Nature to split and let your buffed up rat chomp through enforcers and punishers.  For me it was a 1 CH per fight deal, with the lvl 58 DS and potc on the rat, and only the epic and bracer click to get me some damage credit on the kill.  I set up my camp in the corner to the right as you enter, next to Dreamthief's cell, to avoid the wraith which spawns every so often when someone is in the room.<br />
<br />
For the difficulty of the area the reward is very good.  Only rarely was I in any danger, and if I was it was a group of Mauvin seekers plowing by to get their flag done.  Without Dire Charm this could be a problematic camp, as you don't have a lot of room to be running around in the jail trying to recharm.  The rampages and flurries add up and can quickly drain your hp away if you have 3 or more punishers/enforcers chasing you.  I first tried this camp alone at 61, and my gear on my magelo profile hasn't changed much since, in case you want a reference for your stats.  Hardest part about this camp is finding it open on Tunare. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lyliani Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get DC, and DC a rat by DR. If you can do that succesfully, and DR isn't camped, you're in POJ heaven :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What the smeg is DR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Apocalypse Criterion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What agro problems ?<br />
<br />
I've soloed down there a ton with charm and never had a single problem. Guards don't add on rats unless you sit down when they are in range (and thats your won fault).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Attack a prisoner with a DC rat in the kos wing down the set of stairs near the High Guardian/mavuin hall.<br />
<br />
During the fight you will get multiple rat adds, and at least one guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The biggest problem I had in the basement was that my dire charmed rat would occasionally warp back to spawn point.  It would get aggro either from some annoying undead mob or from respawns that I hadn't cleared, die before I could figure out where it was to get in healing range, and then I'd be faced with a potentially huge train (and a gray dire charm button).<br />
<br />
I haven't tried since the pathing changes though...</div></div><hr />
