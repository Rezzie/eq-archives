I am looking for ideas on how I can get these runes in when I only have about 1KPP.<br />
 <br />
Also I was wondering what the druid chat channel was for across all servers so if needed I can ask my fellow druids for help if needed.</div></div><hr />

Although I have heard of them dropping in RSS.  Level 70 runes are NO DROP and will not be found in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

I can't really help on where to get them since I only have 2 myself, damn group oak eludes me. The Ancient Runes are drops from Anguish and those you will need a raid for.</div></div><hr />

I preferred the statue camp (top of stairs near Queen) as there are a number of named within easy pulling range.<br />
<br />
For Glowing Shadowspine check http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=44497. I had some success with various named in RoI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eiram</div><div class="date">02-08-2006, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are only very few groupable Mobs that drop Glowing runes in farmable marges. I spend a huge ammount of time in RSS and saw only 3 glowing runes drop so far.<br />
Even the &quot;easier&quot; raidmobs in RCoD or WoS drop Glowing Runes only on a 30 to 50% chance from my experience.<br />
A steady source for Glowing Runes for my guild were MPG Raidtrials, but they were not trivial at all.<br />
 <br />
In MPG Grouptrials there should be a 20% chance for a glowing rune on a victory.<br />
 <br />
Good luck to everyone who need them.</div></div><hr />

The hardest part is finding a group. I am not part of a raiding guild (actually I am the only member left of my guild - hehehe) and finding a group to hunt in the places that the runes drop can be daunting to say the least.<br />
 <br />
The Druids Grove does have a cross server channel - /join serverwide.druidsgrove [the password is password]<br />
 <br />
I wish you luck!!</div></div><hr />

These are the two easier trials imo and dad seen a decent drop rate on these.<br />

I know a few people who also camped Bluespark for hours and seen a few there.</div></div><hr />

While this may be true, one would still need access. And that is priceless. Trying to get a decent XP group, let alone a mission arc group is damn near impossible. Wednesday night I was LFG for about 3 hours with only 6 people including me in the LFG tool. I swear the server was deserted, even if Netura claims he was busy farming with his &quot;clique&quot;. =p</div></div><hr />
