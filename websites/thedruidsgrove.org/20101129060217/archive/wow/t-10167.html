I'm almost to lvl 56, and I just respecced for the third time (thanks GhostBear) - i'm now feral/resto, instead of trying to pull off a tri-spec template.<br />
<br />
My question is, what would y'all suggest be the best PvP gear I could use at this point? With MotW I'm currently a little over 1500 AC in caster form, and approx 5k AC in bear form. I've got right at 200 Int, about 190ish Stam, and a little over 100 Agility. I'm going for an agility, stam, int mix at the moment. I haven't been getting butchered much (provided 4 or 5 don't gang up on me - which does happen due to my many enemies) so I guess i'm on the right track...</div></div><hr />

That is, if you want to kill people.  If you're more a healer sort of pvp'er, go for stamina and int/spi i guess.<br />
<br />
PVP isn't really my forte, perhaps others on this forum can advise you better than I can..<br />

<br />
Things like the Bone Ring Helm, Death's Clutch, Wild Heart Kilt, Boots of the Shrieker.  The best pvp gear imho is the AB faction lizardhide set (and ofcourse Rank12/13 but that's a serious, serious time investment)... that's some good stuff.</div></div><hr />

I'm more of a healer/offensive player.</div></div><hr />

Very nice for bear/cat form.. :)  Plus, it's craftable..<br />

Saw that in the AH several times...I see plenty of stuff for feral forms (str, stam, agi) but rarely see stuff good for caster form :(  I've got a couple guildies helping me out with devilsaur leather...gonna  do the gauntlets/leggings combo there.</div></div><hr />
