<br />
Just a small question : I hear everybody saying while socketing to take +12STA gems instead of some +AGI gems if your dodge rating is &quot;enough&quot;. What do you consider &quot;enough&quot;. For the moment self-buffed I have about 36% dodge, 14K HP, 30% crit chance and 25K armour. Should I invest even more in dodge or go all the way of +STA now ? I'm already crit immune ofc.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-09-2008, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think &quot;enough&quot; is a personal opinion. I had 15.1k health, 34.4k armor, and 42% dodge, unbuffed, and would have kept going for an even balance of increasing my dodge and stamina. I looked at it all as a net-stats, rather than individually. When I needed a bit more of both stamina and agility, I socketed heavily with Shifting Nightseye for a compromise.<br />
<br />
Imo, it comes down to if you feel you want more dodge or stamina. Your own method of tanking, basically. And while I find stamina stacking to be a warrior trait, some people can tank like that, and in certain situations (slim on buffs) stamina can be more beneficial.<br />
<br />
Sooo. I'd say you're decent on your stamina and dodge, judging by your level of armor. Personally, I'd work on getting that armor up, but as far as gems go, I'd say either balance between the two so your health and dodge goes up, orrr feel free to lean towards whichever stats you like; your health and dodge levels allow you that, currently. I think you'd do better to get a tad more stamina before agility, though, just to even the levels out.<br />

Thanks It's quite common for tanks to gem all +stam. Especially in your case. I've heard of a 40% raidbuffed dodge cap for bear tanks, otherwise they have rage generation issues. If you're at 36% by yourself you would do fine to gem all +stam.</div></div><hr />

There is no such thing as a &quot;40% dodge cap&quot;. When tanking bosses, you will have all the rage you need, no matter how much dodge you have.<br />
<br />
@lucdemeyerus: Your stats are pretty balanced, just go for both stats and keep the balance.</div></div><hr />

They really do help me as I was puzzled what my next move would be. Now I know to continue the way I'm seeing my bear at the moment :)<br />
Just started Kara last week as OT and had no problems. Do you guys think I could MT with these stats ?</div></div><hr />

On bosses, they usually hit hard enough that it's not an issue. <br />
<br />
For all the trash I've faced, 40% is a good target. On bosses, even 50% plus doesn't make me happy. lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raid is 25-man content, and maybe ZA. Kara is something like UBRS was before BC... in the beginning it was hard, but now it is easy and not &quot;raid content&quot; any more. Nowadays you tank trash in Kara in your DPS set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's your dps set? Mine isn't there. lol. I have to admit, that raid buffed (PWF/Kings/etc), i only have a hair over 10k health in my DPS set and about 17k armor in bear form (I checked this last night when I tried to pick up a boss. yeah, no. LOL). While my dodge is retardly high, (close to 60% in feral form), with no crit protection and 17k armor... yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">01-09-2008, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have about the same stats (11.5k HP, 16.5k AC, 50% dodge). And enough resilience (thanks to 2 S2 pieces) that I am crit-immune.<br />
You cannot tank most bosses with that, of course. But the trash mobs? No problem. That assumes of course that your group is on that level as well, pumping out enough DPS and HPS to allow for that.<br />
For the first few bosses I usually use my PvP-set (17k HP and 20k AC), only using my real tanking gear for the likes of Malchezaar or Nightbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elymanrock</div><div class="date">01-10-2008, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot have enough dodge (our Tanking Druid has 60% + in raid form), I would consider once you have meet being uncritable then concertrate on Agil. Your stamina will naturally increase . It has the plus that it increases your armor as well.<br />
<br />
It has the plus side that it helps you regenerate health by crit'ing as well. Also it adds to your dps, rage, etc... etc.<br />
<br />
So any choice between agil or stam, choose Agil - enchants etc...<br />
<br />
Only a few fights like in ZA require a Druid to have less dodge than stamina and mitigation. Halazzi and his Saber Lash &#8212; Deals 12,000-18,000 damage split between two targets, reduced by armor. If your Druid OT dodges this it can be fatal, best to be open and mitigate!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On bear stats.  Your current stats would be fine to tank all the bosses in Karazhan.  In 25 man content you would have some problems, but Karazhan is swiftly becoming the UBRS of TBC.<br />
<br />
There is a psychological factor to take into account as well when choosing stats.  As a healer, I would feel more confident healing a tank with 20,000 health, even if it meant they had given up lots of dodge and armor (within reason).  There is an unspoken acknowledgement among a lot of raiders that the tank with most health is usually the first choice for main tank.<br />
<br />
Rage generation has never been a problem for me, and I doubt it ever will be - regardless of how much dodge I have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, wasn't the cap for dodge 75%?  I know rogues can't get above that even with evasion...<br />

Our Warriors are currently collecting stuff to get to 104% avoidance... because then you are passively immune to crushing blows. As this works, there seems to be no cap on avoidance.</div></div><hr />
