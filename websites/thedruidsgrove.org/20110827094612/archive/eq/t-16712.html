<br />
I have spent the last couple of month at the crocs in LP, at least for my lesson, and noticed that today the AA exp (100AA % exp at 78) has been nerfed by about 50%.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed for me, not the level, I clear about 75% of the beach, if at all I kill a croc or 2 more.<br />
<br />
Since I can not play much at the moment this is most noticable - yesterday I did 7 AA in 1 lesson, today it was a meager 4 AA.<br />
<br />
This really sucks badly, the only thing my druid was good for anymore was to help PL friends and my warrior bot, who will probably be my main soon. It is incredible how much the druid has changed over the years - going from a powerfull soloer and a respectable grouper/raider to a powerful soloer with charm - but a undersired grouper and a laughable raider. Sigh, I am really frustrated now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I'm just guessing, I haven't played EQ in ages. :P</div></div><hr />
