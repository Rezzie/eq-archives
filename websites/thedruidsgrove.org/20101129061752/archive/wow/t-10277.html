I started out on a PVE server (mainly due to my wife who didn't like the idea of getting killed by other people) but now play ONLY on a PVP server.<br />
<br />
I got to 51st lvl on the PVE server and quit....it was getting a little boring.<br />
<br />
I really really enjoy the excitement of fighting other people when running around the world.  I frequently even seek out ally's to kill between battle ground ques.<br />
<br />
How do people on PVE server's feel?  Do you really just like killing mobs without any interference? Ever consider at PVP server?  Or have you tried and just didnt like it?<br />
<br />
Was just curious. <br />

I could not imagine this game without PvP, even the PvE stuff I do is to increase my survivability and strength in PvP.<br />
<br />
I guess I could see someone not wanting to be bothered ever (and you will get ganked ...a lot), but it must get boring after awhile just killing NPC's, real people are the challenge in this game for me :)</div></div><hr />

Just have to take a beating on occassion.  I know I got camped a few times to say the least.<br />
<br />
**BTW, druids are the best anti-gank class around.  Stay feral cat with track on.  You can see just about anyone around you and just hide if you need to.  Even hunters usually use Track Humanoids and cannot pick up a druid in cat form.<br />

It's so much fun to be in the middle of a fight and not know what's going to happen.  It's great getting into a battle and sometimes a large scale battle in the middle of nowhere.<br />
<br />
If you haven't done a pvp server, I would highly suggest it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you can find areas generally near your side's cities or towns that the other side will leave you alone if you just want to grind.  It's not like someone is killing you every 5 minutes.  Go to the right place and 1 fight per hour is alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get my PvP fix now that I'm 58 all I have to do is get in a raid or join Alterac Valley and I'm good to go.<br />
<br />
I can see the enjoyment of a PvP server, but the relaxed atmostphere of a PvE server has its benefits as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sond</div><div class="date">03-20-2006, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a PvE server you don't get beautiful moments like one that happened last night. The guild is getting ready to kill the Blightcaller in Eastern Plaguelands. The last arrival gets ganked by a couple horde right on the other side of the hill. So everyone mounts up and rides them down. I can only imagine what they were thinking when they saw 14 60s ride over the hill a minute later.<br />
<br />
The best part was that they came back while we were fighting Blightcaller. They managed to aggro some of the summoned skeletons while attacking us and promptly died again. We still managed to take down Blightcaller and laughed at them as we rode away.</div></div><hr />

Is there more interaction?  less?  <br />

just wondering, thanks :)</div></div><hr />

PvE server after BG :) <br />

I have a newbie UD priest on Chromaggus and I still prefer my Druid on Gilneas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In beta I leveled up to 55 alliance (cap at the time) and 47 horde... For every glorious moment you miss, there's the bottom of the barrel moments that you don't.  Like in beta there was one level cap'ed UD mage that'd do nothing but camp the northern area of STV (invis!).  <br />
<br />
I never really found it much of a challenge level'n up in a pvp enviorment in this game or in Shadowbane or in EQ pvp.  It's bit slower, but bit more exciting on a pvp server... so it's a trade-off.<br />
<br />
On PvE servers we have BG's and before that there were often battles around TM/SS and Grom'grol.  In general I like the team games, as WoW is a team game.  I don't really take much pride one way or the other in duels, 1vs1 in wow isn't terribly great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vamped</div><div class="date">04-18-2006, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im from proudmore a pve server came here because of friends who introduced me to the game<br />
i still get a small fix from BG's big wait for them to pop i think 3:1 aliance on my server<br />
but you can still go raid crossroads with a small group or get a larger raid and go hit UC through the tunnel or thunderbluff<br />
<br />
you can still turn pvp on at any time but if you forget you get smashed if you didnt see those three horde ride up behind you 8 )<br />
even on pvp servers you have to be in a certain area and the other side has to hit you or turn pvp on there isnt much difference i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">04-18-2006, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Played on a PvP server from the time they introduced the first PvP server in closed beta, until a few months back. Honestly with BG's out now, and the near death of world pvp aside from ganking, I fail to see the purpose of PvP servers anymore until they fix DHK's. PvP servers were nice because of the additional risk involved in getting to 60, but after 60 it was pretty much the same as a PvE server with people living in BG's trying to get epic pvp gear through rep and honor. <br />
<br />
PvE is ok....there are times I wish I could kill the gold farmers when I need to collect some materials for a pattern or something I need made, but aside from that I really have no desire to ever move back to a PvP server realm again. If they make world PvP more enticing and rewarding it might shift my thinking but I seriously doubt that is ever going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">05-02-2006, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1v1 in WoW is pretty much rock-paper-scissors sometimes.. but I still like the idea of contested territories when you're not safe anywhere and can be jumped whenever (and you WILL be, believe me =)). It's also cool to jump other players and stress-test them to see how good they acctually are in REAL PvP and not &quot;fixed&quot; duels. You'll be surprised how the master duelist REALLY plays much worse when he's not prepared.. or how that crappy duelist REALLY puts up a fight when it comes down to it.<br />
<br />
Sure, all PvP servers have lame people that like to lowbie gank and corpse camp.. but most serious PvP:ers don't do that.. just live with it and you'll enjoy the diversity of a PvP server. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canidbeast</div><div class="date">05-10-2006, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on a PvE server origionally because I do not think it should take 15 minutes to turn in a quest when it takes 5 minutes to normally get there.  I love to pvp in battlegrounds, and honestly believe that the pvp system (flagging rules) is great...just make it so civilians cannot be hit (it is possible, some npc's can be targeted, just not attacked).  If that was fixed, world pvp on a pve server has great potential :texla: <br />
<br />
<br />
I probably will move to a PvP server, don't get me wrong there.   Looks like it has potential.</div></div><hr />

Southern Tanaris really pissed me off because the corpse run was so long...about 5minutes. But other than that, it's fun and just awesome.</div></div><hr />
