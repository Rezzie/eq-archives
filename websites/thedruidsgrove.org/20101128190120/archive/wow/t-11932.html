If the other duid is tanking I find my self (at least I think I am) lacking of DPS.  <br />
<br />
Do you guys have recommendation like you have on the tank gear list?  (which I have been following and almost have all the gear)   Which attributes do I need to put in priority to build a good DPS gear?<br />
<br />
Also do we as druids have a demand role as DPS in end-game content?<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say go primarily for str/AP until 2600-2800 AP unbuffed. After that 1 agi is better than 1 str.<br />
Of course you should always go for both, but if you have to choose take above consideration into account.<br />
<br />
Here you find a nice list of DPS-Items:<br />
http://www.gurgleblaster.net/emmerald/Cat_Sustained_DPS/Head.html<br />
<br />
About our viability as DPS class end-game content: I am regularly one of the top damage dealers in Kara and Gruul. I haven't been to SSC, Mag or above.<br />
Generally the real use of a feral is the ability to switch between tank and DPS. In Kara it is extremely useful to have a very able tank for trashmobs that can deal a lot of damage in boss fights too, or switch to bear and tank something for a short time in case the MT goes down towards the end of a bossfight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a mixture of DPS gear i use, i dont really put that much effort into top DPS gera due to the fact i only use it solo when farming or questing and always end up tanking...<br />

so that much would be based on what roll you play in groups or solo.  as for the professions.  i wotn change.  to addicted to... pots.... =P</div></div><hr />

Or  rather it makes a baseline assumption about it being low.  If this is not true, then you need to evaluate the gear differently.  If you're hit rating is high enough, and your AP is still sitting around 2500-2800, you can easily start to shrug off some of the high AP gear for high agi gear.  Just as with hit rating, there is a crit cap on white damage which i found to be the largest single contributor to my dps weighing in just under shred at ~45%.  Make sure you're not wasting that!  And always attack from the back. . . No block/parry from behind changes the attack table.<br />

<br />
<br />
 Mangle<br />
 Shred until you get 4 combo points (5 if something crits)<br />
 Wait until you have ~70E.  Rip, followed immediately by step 1 so the Rip bleeds get the Mangle buff.<br />
I'm told there are times when a power-shift can be beneficial as well, but I don't remember the details of when to perform that action.  Bite should be left out of PvE rotations unless the mob will die from it as the damage to energy ratios are awful.<br />
<br />
Obviously, you should use FFF sometime between Shreds.</div></div><hr />

You could use more crit chance, but with your stats you should be in the upper half of damage meters. In a 5-man you should be first or second. <br />
<br />
Well, that depends on the other members of your group. If you have a T6 equipped Warlock in your group that is skilled for PvE damage, you will always be behind him ^^.</div></div><hr />

Claw is really a useless ability once you have Mangle. Mangle costs the same in energy and does more damage in any and all situations.<br />
Just use Shred. If you do not have the energy for it, wait another tick. Really.<br />
<br />
You can FFF earlier. I usually do it on every global cooldown where I do not have enough energy for Shred or Mangle.<br />
<br />
Also, for bleed-immune mobs, I'd suggest simply not using Ferocious Bite unless you have less than 42 energy. Using it with any more is a waste. If you already have 5 combo points and have 42 or more, just Shred again. Keep using Shred (or Mangle, if you need to reapply the debuff) until you have less than 42 energy left, then use Ferocious Bite. In my experience Shred simply scales better with AP.</div></div><hr />

Idol of Terror is pretty good for bear, but not as good for cat DPS. The shred idol will give you better sustained DPS. <br />

The fact that it does, is the primary reason why it should be avoided except in very few scenarios.<br />

Think of it like, Frenzied Regeneration.  The times in which this bear skill can be safely used are very, very limited.  Kitty's FB is the same way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">11-28-2007, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see both sides of this debate.<br />
<br />
I would agree that your choice of which move to use depends on how much energy you have.  For example, if I had 100 energy and 5 combo points, I could reasonably expect to shred, shred, bite, without any delay waiting for energy.  So just using FB straight away denies me 2 &quot;free&quot; shreds.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if I had 35 energy and 5CP, i wouldn't have enough for a shred, so I'd be best just blowing it on FB.<br />
<br />
So what if I have 42 energy?  That's the amount of energy needed for 1 shred.  (FB requires 35 energy)<br />
<br />
It would take me another 2 ticks of energy to be able to afford a ferocious bite after shredding:  The shred would use all my remaining 42 energy, and then I would get 1 tick for 20/100 energy, then 2nd tick for 40/100 energy - bite costs 35.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at it the other way around.  I bite on 42 energy - i'm reduced to zero.  I have to wait one tick (20), 2 ticks (40), 3 ticks (60) to have enough for a Shred costing 42 energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
So therefore if you have 42 energy, you will achieve both moves within 2 energy ticks instead of 3, if you Shred first, then bite.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been looking at the theory behind this question tonight, and it seems to me that (on paper at least) it's only more efficient to bite if you are at 35 or 36 energy.  37 energy is roughly the same efficiency, and with anything above 37 it's more efficient to shred, even if that means waiting for another energy tick.<br />

They bring me along as an 'oh crap' tank/dps/healer. When we're short on warriors or the primary feral druid is out, I spend most of my time tanking, but generally, I'm in cat form.<br />
<br />
I have noticed several times that I find it difficult to achieve top of the damage meter in fights in 25 man raids (SSC/the eye. I haven't done gruul/mags in a long time). On trash fights I normally do well, because cat form has a lot of front end damage when you unload a full energy bar (don't forget OOC and the two peice t4 bonus). On bosses, not so much. Feral druids are very challenged on many SSC/Eye fights:<br />
<br />
Hydross: Need anyone who can tank, especially swipe tank, controlling adds, so I'm always bear form.<br />
<br />
Lurker: Rare fight where druids can usually shine in cat form.<br />
<br />
Leotheras: His whirlwind frequently keeps druids running in and out of range and not doing damage. Our other druid is usually the tank during demon phase (FR and huge health ftw).<br />
<br />
Tidewalker: Again, druids and warriors are usually all picking up adds along with pallies (gotta pull them off the pallies before the pallies die, since most of our pallies just do it in their healing gear, lol).<br />
<br />
Fathomlord: Main druid is usually tanking. In many raid groups, the druid(s) will be tanks since raid groups try to not bring excess tanks and this fight needs them all. If you *do* get to DPS, you can do pretty well for the first half until the ice blocks start slowing you down (which invariably seem to give ranged the DPS advantage).<br />
<br />
Vashj: Killing adds and following vashj as she gets kited around in phase 3 can be a bit of a pain for druids in cat form because our hit box is tiny and keeping in range takes practice. It's generally not bad though.<br />
<br />
Void Reaver: He's bleed immune and when he stomps, you need to back out unless you brought a lot of extra healing, both of which limits your damage potential.<br />
<br />
Alar: The stupid bird is up in the air for the first half of the fight. If you're not tanking alar or the adds, your damage potential is still poop because you can't kill the adds in phase one and everyone is usually tanking/catching adds in phase 2.<br />
<br />
Solarian: Not a bad fight for druids, but because most raids i know of have druids helping catch/control the adds during the aid phases, we miss out on damage time.<br />
<br />
Kael'thas: yeah, um, no. Don't expect to be damage king. Too many reasons to list.<br />
<br />
But, what do druids bring to a raid, if not mad dps? We can tank, we can battle res, we can spot heal, we've got innervate, etc. I used to worry about my spot being lost to a true DPS when we got an extra warrior, but as one raid leader pointed out:<br />
<br />
&quot;you're consistently near the top 5 for dps on all fights, and if one of the top 5 dies because of pulling agro, random AoE, bad luck, lag, etc, YOU bring him back and his additional damage after res could theoretically be attributed to you.&quot;<br />

I used to feel this way when I was in Kara/Gruul's/SSC/The Eye. But once your guild starts getting into Mt. Hyjal and Black Temple, you won't be near the top 5, you'll steadily fall back further and further and you'll be struggling to be top 10, with no sign of the decline leveling off. Then once your guild gets closer to Illidan, and the fights become really challenging, you'll find that a feral druid doing 1/2 to 1/3 of the DPS of top classes is a liability, despite your other abilities.</div></div><hr />
