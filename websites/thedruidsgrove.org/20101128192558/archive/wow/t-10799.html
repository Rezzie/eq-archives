<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be better off making a macro for the self buff/healer.  Benecast was great for that (just click the little buttons that appear by your character portrait)....but it doesn't get updated as quick as needed now.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of macros that I have found.  <br />
<br />
Self Cast Nature's Swiftness/Healing Touch<br />
/cast Nature's Swiftness<br />
/target YourCharacterName<br />
/cast Healing Touch(Rank 10)<br />
/script TargetLastEnemy();<br />
<br />
Nature's Swiftness Healing Touch<br />
/cast Nature's Swiftness<br />
/cast Healing Touch(Rank 10)<br />
  	  	 <br />
Self cast Innervate<br />
/target YourCharacterName<br />
/cast Innervate<br />
/target YourCharacterName<br />
/script TargetLastEnemy();<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some!</div></div><hr />

I am learning a little bit though.  Never tried a group buff macro.  You might check out WoW's macro forums or do a google search for some.  That's how I found some of the ones that kinda taught me the basics of the macros.<br />
<br />
If I end up finding a good group buff addon I will let you know.</div></div><hr />

tried this and i have to click the macro twice. Is that right?<br />
hoped it would autocast both.<br />
<br />
and could i adjust this for barkskin and tranquility?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-08-2006, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You shouldn't have to hit the macro twice to get both casts.  It might take a second to cast the second one, not do them both simultaneously.<br />
<br />
And yes it should work for Barkskin and Tranquility....just change the spell name and make sure you put the correct rank.</div></div><hr />

With this addon, you right click the spell and it casts it on you.  It dosent matter what you're targeting and it dosent change your target.  It's simple but very versitile.<br />
<br />
And about the macros, I havent tried it with druid skills yet but as far as I know, you can't have multiple casts in a single click macro.<br />
<br />
You could also try here: http://ui.worldofwar.net/listmacros.php?type=5<br />
I've made it to lvl 56 doing everything manualy (with the exception of the rclick addon above) so I dont know how usefull the worldofwar.net link will be as I havent tried any of their stuff.</div></div><hr />

I use Group Buttons, it might be what your looking for... altho' some people find the set-up to be intimidating... I liked it better then Benecast when both were aviable.<br />
<br />
That said I'd love a mod for buffing that worked like Decrusive. Somthing to auto-targeted people without MoTW and single target buff them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">birdbleed</div><div class="date">07-09-2006, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so since my last post I've been checking this out a little more.  This macro casts your highest lvl heal on you instantly with one button click.  It's quite nice.<br />
<br />
/script CastSpellByName(&quot;Nature's Swiftness&quot;);SpellStopCasting();CastSpellByName(&quot;Healing Touch&quot;,true);<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">09-29-2006, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look for a addon on curse gaming called buffbot.  I think that is what your looking for.  Its bit out of date but it still works.  Make sure its the updated one.  There is an older version that is out of date and does not work right.  <br />
<br />
Basicly it works as follows.  You set what buffs you want casted one each class and then it gives a warning a few seconds/mins before said buff wears out on your party.  You click the button you hot keyed to it and it refreshes the buff.  Once in while Omen messes up on it.  And you need refresh the UI but reloading after aquiring new spells or you can camp and come back.  It will also cast cures on those in your party/raid that need them but just hitting the related hot key.  Over all its very nice addon all rolled into one.</div></div><hr />
