No luck.  From talking with other druids, I believe that all known druid/ranger spell vendors have been hit at least once.  If it's on a vendor, it is probably some out of the way (or new), unexpected merchant.  More likely it is either quested, or not actually available on live servers yet.<br />
<br />
The level 5 harmony will still work on mobs below level 40.</div></div><hr />

Don't EVER forget that VI is a BUSINESS.  VI doesn't make this game for you out of the goodness of their hearts... they make it for the almighty dollar!  The best way for them to make money is to sell the game and it's monthly access.  If they disappoint enough so that they begin to lose revenue, they will either change the game, try a new marketing plan or let it slide in hopes of increasing revenues in another area.<br />

The raid feature and added levels does FAR more than the lack of any spell does to offer incentive to buy PoP.  I believe that the spells available in PoP are dropable and thus could be carried to the &quot;old world&quot;.<br />

You could even argue that what they did was unethical or at the very least stupid.  A key element for any business is to develope trust with thier customer.  What Sony did to us has seriously shaken my trust in them.  Since money is the symbol of trust in this capitalist environment wich I support.  It time we vote with our wallets and send Sony the message that if they insist on treating thier costumers like this we will no longer be sending our trust to them.</div></div><hr />

Over the years its had its ups and downs, but I dont know anyone who would ever buy another mmorpg from Sony/Verant, with the possible exception of SWG since thats on the other coast, but even then my friends are hesitant.<br />
<br />
The only thing saving EQ now, and still, is the lack of alternatives.  If the marketplace had more choice, they wouldnt be able to get away with treating their customers the way they do.  As it is, at any one time so far we've had 2 or 3 alternatives, tops, and not very good ones imho.<br />
<br />
So goes EQ, the game I love, run by people I dont trust.  But dont think I'll be back after I move on.<br />

1) The raid feature and all of the added Planes are 100 USELESS to me. I am a Druid. I solo. I dont belong to an uber guild who can go to these new Planes nor can 99% of you who read this. Therefore this update is a total rip-off to everyone except the 1% of the EQ paying customers who belong to an uber guild. I am totally disgusted by this.<br />
<br />
2) How can this not have gone live. If the nerf went live then the new spell also has to have gone live. Ifg it hasn't then that is an unforgiveable bug. Can anyone venture a theory as to why Verant had to nerf Harmony in the first place? HOw was it beign abused that it had to be nerfed?<br />
<br />
3) As to the comments about business. The first rule of all businesses is to make the customer happy. You know, &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. Verant seems to have no clue about this very basic business tenet.</div></div><hr />

Well, considering that I have seen druids and wizards soloing in the new planes, they aren't useless.  And you don't have to be in an uber guild... 6 people, even with mini-CH from a druid or shaman, can do just fine in some of those zones.</div></div><hr />

Uh...  There's plenty of content there that can be solo'd.  And plenty that can be handled with a single group, meaning most of the posters here can benefit from the new hunting spot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenmarel</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So now that the new spell is out has anyone bothered to go test it?  I tried it out on some Drolvargs in DL and it seamed to work nice.  Out of 3 tries no resists.  Great recast time.  Mana cost is a little high but, I'm not sure how the cost compares with other classes Lulls.  I think they should consider making it cost 25-50 mana instead.  Particularly for the sake of Rangers who don't have as large a mana pool as Druids.  <br />
<br />
As for the PoP conspiracy they only got it half right.  Since Harmony was an original Everquest Spell.  Nature's Harmony should be available at every starting Druid/Ranger guild.  Not only in SoL.  Atleast its not No Drop.  So if you know some poor Druid/Ranger without SoL who needs this spell help them out.  I have a few questions that I hope some of you can answer.<br />
<br />
How is the spell working for you?  <br />
Is it resisted alot?  <br />
What mobs have you tried it on and how does it perform?  <br />
How does it compare with other classes Lulls Cleric/Bard?  <br />
Does it aggro on resist?  <br />
Do you think Mana cost is too high considering the low cost of Old Harmony?<br />
<br />
Finally to Sony.  You are a business and must make money.  But businesses do not work in a vacuum.  Business need customers.  You have dammage the Trust of many in this comunity.  I hope that you will start today working on repairing this trust.  We will conitnue to support you as long as you respect our value as your customers.  Do this and we will have New Harmony.</div></div><hr />

Attacking Ishiro for posting information on another class board, has nothing to do with the fact that he completely refuted your uninformed statement that soloing in PoP is not possible. You either a) didn't read his answer, or b) are too embarassed to admit you're arguing from ignorance.<br />
<br />
You can solo in PoP, if that's what you really want to do.<br />

Of course, the current problem are the kiters who are training the graveyards on a regular basis, but that's a flame thread for another day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The spell Harmony of Nature is sold on the same guy in Shadow Haven that sells the protection line spells. 16pp. NO POP NEEDED.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with it. Got it, ran out to WW and cast it on one of the Sapara's (jen?) They're level 62...she resisted and came at me. I decided to go test it on Briana Treewhisper our 60 (?) guildmaster in NK. Cast it 25 times...no resists. I cast it on the nexus scion...resist, and she was pissed at me. ;p I cast it on myself twice with 180MR, resisted once, and landed once. I used it in a group in PoD pulling puslings. we were there for 4 or 5 hours, 0 resists.<br />
<br />
Its 100 mana, and NOT ae, so you have to cast it on every mob near the one you want to pull. So if you want to grab 1 ou of 8, thats 800 mana. Kind of annoying per-pull but not that bad. And, it doesn't have the long recast as our old harmony.<br />
<br />
So, as far as I can tell, the risk added is extremly minimal.<br />

<br />
Harmony of Nature<br />
mana cost: 100<br />
resist adjust: -10<br />
max level: 65<br />
Frenzy/Reaction radius: 15<br />
<br />
compared with the best paladin/cleric/enc spell<br />
Pacify<br />
mana cost: 100<br />
resist adjust: 0<br />
max level: 55<br />
Frenzy/Reaction radius: 1<br />
<br />
or Wake of Tranquility, which is the same but 300 mana/max level 60, AE<br />
<br />
<br />
Harmony still provides something that the Pacify line doesn't, namely higher level splitting with even less (and Pacify gets resisting about 1 time in 100 on blue cons, from my experience) chance of a resist.  So I wouldn't worry that you've been completely overtaken by other classes.<br />
<br />
Oh, and about 1/4 of the things in PoInnovation are flagged immune to pacify/harmony, which would be why you're getting immune messages.. the other Planes don't seem to have this so much.<br />

Clerics and enchanters get Wake of Tranquility which is a better version of our old Harmony that also works indoors, but is capped at level 60.  Looks like the outdoor only HoN is capped at 65.  Clerics, enchanters and paladins get an indoor version of HoN that is better except it caps at 55, Pacify.  Then of course at 65 clerics get Pacification which works to 65, is indoorable and lasts 3 or 4 times as long as HoN.  So it would seem clerics &gt; druids for harmony.<br />
 <br />
  I'm really not sure what they were trying to do when they changed Harmony.  I haven't used HoN much, but it doesn't seem a whole lot different than Harmony other than the loss of the AE.</div></div><hr />
