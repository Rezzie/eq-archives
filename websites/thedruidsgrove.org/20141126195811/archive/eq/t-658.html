Quotes from another thread (http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=27871.t  opic):<br />
 Nobody (read: Not druids nor wizards) should have gotten teleporting abilities from the start.<br />
<br />
It was a very poor decision By Verant to give teleport abilities to players <br />
Do people seriously think like this? Have I just been totally oblivious to people's feelings towards port abilities? I have always been under the impression that people in general LIKED that there were classes that could teleport/translocate. Hi, 20 minute boats rides. Hi, 30 minute hikes. Hi, 15 min wait on Nexus and THEN a 30 minute hike.<br />
<br />
When I made my druid, I was such a noob, I didn't even realize that I would get group porting abilities. So obviously that is NOT why I chose this toon, it is NOT why I love this toon more than all my others. <br />
<br />
 For all the druids that will happily give strangers ports all day long, there are more that will either overcharge for the service, or outright deny it at their own whim. Same is true for wizards. The resentment created by druids/wizards that wouldnt port another player for a legitimate reason (i.e. I dont feel like it sorry)<br />
This is very possibly the most naive, immature, ludicrous, and out and out STUPID thing I have ever read on this board. Let me lay this scenario out for you.<br />
<br />
I am in Thurgadin.<br />
I am working on a quest for myself there.<br />
RandomNonPortingGimp_01 tells you, 'WC plz'<br />
<br />
Heh. I suppose I have 4 options here:<br />
1. Ignore this.<br />
2. /reply STFU, no.<br />
3. /reply I'm sorry, I'm rather busy at this time.<br />
4. Port yer sorry self, and SoW you upon landing.<br />
Typically, I go with option 3. Because contrary to popular belief, I am not a total @#%$. <br />
<br />
Plain and simple, the author of the above quote is an extraordinary imbecile. If I don't want to port you, brainbox, simply because I don't feel like it.. umm, that is my choice. If I want to charge you 300pp to go to EJ for a Sev mobilization that you are SO LATE to.. umm, that is my choice. Supply and demand baby. Ever study econ? It is MY ability, I have to drop what I am doing, port MYSELF out, along with you, to whatever zone you MUST get to ASAP. If I wanna jack the prices for a port, if I want to say NO to you at a whim, it's my perogative. Deal with it, find another port, or pray to your chosen diety that you have the stamina to run from point A to point B. Do you really think that you deserve an explanation for why I won't port you? And do you really think that if I don't have a reason that you deem worthy, than by some rule in your twisted brain, I must port you? Go ahead, resent me. <br />
<br />
Now, look at mages, chanters, clerics, paladins, shamans, hell, even necros. Should I get pissed and cry and whine and bitch if:<br />
Mage won't make me focus items or trod cause they just don't feel like it?<br />
Chanter won't KEI me cause they just don't feel like it?<br />
Cleric won't Marzin, Rez, or Aego me cause they just don't feel like it?<br />
Paladin won't AC buff me cause they just don't feel like it?<br />
Shaman won't rit health, stamina, focus, or whatever me cause they just don't feel like it?<br />
Necro won't DMF or twitch me cause they just don't feel like it?<br />
<br />
Should those spells be taken away from them because they just aren't in the mood to cast it on every damn person that walks by? Should we all be up in arms at Verant crying and saying they should never have gotten the ability to cast these spells for the simple reason that YOU can't be polite, articulate, or contributing when asking for something from someone?<br />
<br />
Here's something I do.<br />
Maybe you all don't, but hell, it works.<br />
If I want KEI..<br />
/w enc all<br />
scan list and find someone who is NOT in a place like Ssra.<br />
/tell RandomChanter 200plat for C3?<br />
<br />
Chanter will do it. Chanter will be HAPPY to do it. You may have to go to them, but regardless. (You will always find ones that will just not answer you.. I like to think they're AFK, and not ignoring me, but I'm probably delusional there) Sure, 200plat is high for a single cast. But it's worth it, it gets you what you want, when you want it. Additionally, Chanter will be happy to do it for you again, next time you ask. And they probably will even decline your trade. I can't count how many Chanters have told me.. 'Kildy, you pay to much, keep your plats this time, and next time is on me as well'. <br />
<br />
So in line with that theory..<br />
You need a port?<br />
/w 39 50 dru all<br />
again find one that is NOT in a fighting zone, look for those in WC.. etc.<br />
/tell RandomDru SomePlat for pickup and port to someplace?<br />
<br />
Note: WC plz, GD plz, Port to GD, or simply walking up to me, hailing me, and saying &quot;WC&quot;, will get you no where, other than a glimpse of my /rude emote as I port myself out to get away from you.<br />
<br />
Lastly, be creative. Be articulate. We are not like the soulbinders, scions, or the new translocators at the docks that you can boss around. My favorite request for a port to date? <br />
In Thurg, making pottery thingys.<br />
DwarfWarrior tells you, 'Hello, happen to have time for a port to WL?'<br />
You tell DwarfWarrior, 'Sorry hun, I can't, I'm working to fill orders on pottery items people asked for ages ago. Good luck.'<br />
DwarfWarrior tells you, 'Please, Fair Lady, I am in dire need of a port. In exchange, a beautiful flower for a beautiful lady, and some coins to aid you in your pottery attempts.'<br />
Next thing I know, a trade window popped up.<br />
10plat, and a Rose of Firiona.<br />
Dwarf got his port to WL, not because of the plat (I would have still said no to cash only), but simply because he made me laugh.</div></div><hr />

I have to say that guys post really pissed me off too.<br />
<br />
Somewhere along the line people got the impression that druids are like soulbinders.  Hail them, tell them to do something and they will do it for you.<br />
<br />
I have not charged for a port since I was a hungry level 40 trying to save up for GEB's.  Even then I didn't do it as a business...but you know what?  Every time I see the taxi drivers come through (&quot;porting to all druid rings ... Tox, Feerrot, Butcher, etc etc&quot;) I want to cheer.  Why?  Because I don't want people stranded...but I also don't want to spend my entire game session running around moving people just because they tell me to.<br />
<br />
I port a lot for my guild and happily.  But we are all entitled to time to do whatever the hell we feel like, even if we are just chatting with friends and sitting on our butts.  No one has the right to demand anything.<br />
<br />
I have gone to specialists when I have needed them...a necro for a summon, a cleric for a rez, a chanter for a brain buff.  If needed, I will fetch them, pay them, and put them back when I am done with them.  And I am damn polite about asking.  I also take the time to figure out if they look like maybe they might be available (in WC, in bazaar, or some other place where people drift when at loose ends).<br />
<br />
I can't count the number of times I have seen some druid getting tongue lashed because people seem to think we are the civil service of Norath.<br />
<br />
We are helpful people.  We do move people for that CR.  Just not every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I originally made a druid for the ease of travel, but the irony is that I found (especially in a guild) that I spent more time making travel easier for others than I would spend on my alts CRAWLING across norrath on my hands and knees. The nexus leaves people with even less excuse now for thinking that they need a port.<br />
<br />
They don't seem to get that you saving them 15 minutes adds up when its several 15 minutes from several people and you need that mana back and to get back to what you were doing.<br />
<br />
Resurrections don't save 15 minutes. I never asked for one when they did. I never even wanted a resurrect when it saved me an hour. I never got or desired a resurrect until LEVEL FIFTY ONE. I never &quot;NEEDED&quot; one before that. It wasn't until I was losing over 10 - 12 hours, the equivilent of several days play for me since I dont' really xp grind, that I even thought I could not play without a res. <br />
<br />
My 37 troll sk has not had a res. It hardly ever dies but if it does it doesn't even try to get one. It doesn't need an xp res because the time loss is small. I really don't think my cleric does but of course at 39 it now has a 60 percent one, which is all it ever needs.<br />
<br />
To me ideal interdependance is when everyone can do things for everyone. It isn't when a resurrect becomes the MOST needed thing of all, clarity becomes needed for not being mired in a sea of downtime and ports are more or less not needed at all unless you are lazy or  the TD or Velious boat system takes about its maximum possible time of up to 50 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Lately I don't get why people personally tell me for ports mainly because every 5 seconds in whatever zone I'm in some druid advertises they are porting for donations. My gad, I wish to heck that clerics were yelling about ressing for donations that often.<br />
<br />
The entire design of EQ is shot to heck because there is UNEQUAL interdependance. If a port is going to save you 15 minutes to 45 minutes max at level 56, then a resurrect at level 56 should save you 15 minutes to 45 minutes max of lost xp. Guess what? if the res did you'd hardly hear anyone asking for a res. People just normally don't die that often unless they are WITH a cleric and plan on it. My druid would eat up to 45 minutes in a heartbeat without even thinking about it. However, at level 56 its not 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
Even worse than the cleric/druid comparison is the comparison of a class with nothing to offer. Warriors ask me for ports, I wonder how they'd react if I gave a warrior personal tells asking for him to come over and melee something to death from me then stand aside while I got all the goodies? Its really the same thing he is asking me to do.<br />
<br />
All of that stuff is why interdependance breaks down and why if you put it in a game, you sure have to design for it better than they did. It has to be equal and everyone has to have it. Oh, you can't think of a way for a warrior to have something he does which is as desired as the type of resurrections that clerics can do? THEN DON'T DESIGN IT THAT WAY, instead make xp loss on dying less so resurrects are not &quot;needed&quot; as they are 51 plus.<br />
<br />
This is how an mmorpg SHOULD be designed. Classes should be set up, or even better just skills in a classless game, so that all are desired. During the design process they should say, &quot;Okay, is someone starting a group going to say &quot;WE NEED A SHADOWKNIGHT! COME ON? THERE MUST BE ONE OUT THERE TO GROUP WITH US?&quot; &quot;  If the answer is no, as it would be for EQ, then its back to the drawing board. YOU CAN'T have one or two classes people think they NEED in the group with the remaining classes being filler and have interdependance work. It doesn't work because I am not as important and the SK or paladin are even often less important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will port people ONLY for donations, IF they choose to offer... I have been offered everything from 200 plat to a loaf of bread to summoned water.... YES summoned water LOL<br />
<br />
But I took it gracefully and didn't gripe..... and guess what....<br />
that low level toon who needed a port was actually an alt of a 60 Chanter WITH KEI capability.... these days I have a HEALTHY relationship with this chanter for unlimited KEI...<br />
<br />
Also, I am quite flattered when I have dorfs and gnomes who ask for a port then offer me a rose or some other gift while commenting on my physical beauty.... it seems my Tunarean Soldiers armor and GEBS make me look quite nice.... FLATTERY will get you a port just about everytime!<br />
<br />
And it also works out when I need/want to camp something and I look up one of those level 55+ dorf warriors or clerics who needed a port...<br />
<br />
It's about give and take.... but yes, there are those who DEMAND my services, usually immediately that will get the cool brush off.... most times I just tell em they have bad breath and offer them a Royal Mint..... LOL</div></div><hr />

Other classes take porting for granted. Especially the naked twinks. Gone are the days of free 'mercy' ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sindarella</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess for me porting depends on the mood I'm in.  I've ported for free on a whim, not asked personally just saw the shout and responded, or for donations.  I can fully understand dealing with someone asking for a port when I'm busy, I mean how do they know what I'm doing, but I try to take the polite answer standpoint and hope that it doesn't turn ugly.<br />
<br />
More often than not it does turn ugly and I can either ignore, which I do most times, or I can spend 15 minutes sending witty commentary back and forth then ignore when I get bored.  Over my time on EQ I have heard millions of reasons why I should port someone, as I'm sure you all have.  I have selected my personal favorites to share with you.<br />
<br />
Number 1, It's your job.  (yeah, I loved that one too)<br />
<br />
Number 2, It's not like you're doing anything important<br />
<br />
Number 3, Why should I pay you?  It's not like it costs you anything.<br />
<br />
Number 4, If you don't port us me and my friends will KS your camp (I kid you not, nice huh?) <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong there are great people out there too.  I've made lots of friends through porting and even handing out a buff or two as I run by someone.  The key is to not let the crummy people get to you.  I know it's hard, they get to me too but the bottom line is I'm playing to have fun and I'm not going to let someone who thinks it's &quot;my job&quot; to port them ruin that for me.</div></div><hr />

Yes, when I get KEI enchanters EXPECT a minimum of 100 plat for the service.... on the 7th Hammer I've had SEVERAL chanters tell me the price is 200 plat.....  and yes, a few times those same chanters who price me at 200 plat for KEI have asked and expected a port from me for practically nothing...  they say it costs twice as much mana for them to KEI me than for me to port them.... so I say, well, then your cost for a port should be 50% of what I paid you for KEI correct?  This guy laughs and says he's NEVER gonna pay more than 25 plat for a ort period and that I'm ripping him off if I charge/expect more...<br />
<br />
LOL so, I /ooc in GD zone what just happened and the guy sits there cuz no one will port him.... he's told to take the spires and he says he can't cuz laglin crashes him to desktop... I sit there for 35 minutes and laugh everytime he gets turned down for a port... FINALLY one of his guildies shows up to port him... <br />

<br />
IMO it is perfectly acceptable for a chanter to charge a fee for spending 900 of his/her mana for the convenience of another player. It will probably save that player a total of 20-25 minutes of time they would've otherwise spent medding ... that is, assuming the person starts hunting immediately after they get KEI.<br />
<br />
However, player-cast ports are also a convenience. It saves them time (in some cases *more* than 25 minutes). But for druid ports, we are also required to spend time zoning to the destination, spend mana for the port back, and spend more time zoning back. I'd say 5 minutes is probably a fair average of our own time that we must spend to provide the service, in addition to 370+ mana (not to mention the mana for casting SoE on demand).<br />
<br />
Then there are the professional KEI vendors ... you know, the ones who shout &quot;casting KEI for donations&quot; and group up 5 people for one cast. Cha-ching, 500pp for 900 mana, which they'll med back while waiting for the next group to come a-runnin'.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for building goodwill, my response to one of these KEI vendors requesting a port would be, &quot;Sure thing, just give me back that 100pp you charged 10 minutes ago.&quot;<br />

<br />
Regarding the enchanters...I think 200p is a bit steep for KEI, but I can see why they charge for it.  It's not because of the mana they spend casting it, it's what the spell cost them.  Most of the enchanters I know that aren't in &quot;uber&quot; guild such and such have to buy the spell and have spent 20 to 25k for it and they are just trying to get some of their money back.<br />
<br />
Hmm, I paid 15k for Moonfire, 6k for NR, and 25k for mask of stalker...maybe I should start charging for ports to get my money back!  J/K, I don't really like porting.</div></div><hr />

Had my cleric grouped with 2 druids, rogue, paladin and enchanter.  The two druids were excellent.   Tribute to their class.<br />
<br />
Group breaks up and 10 minutes later I decide to go to Thurg to do trade skills.   I am bound by spires so I pop over.   A druid pops into zone and shouts &quot;porting to all druid locations 20 plat&quot;   After I have approached him and kindly asked for a port, I pay him 20 plat and sit to med.  I am sitting quiet and 4 more people join group.   all of a sudden a trade window pops up and he is trying to give me money back.   His reason was I did not know you were a cleric.   I dont port clerics or shamman.  <br />
<br />
Got a port from guildie wiz about 2 mins later but what is up with that?   I notice everyone was quick to jump on cleric who refused to rez druids (most idiotic thing I have ever heard-- i will rez you free of charge any time), but this kind of ticked me off.   Yes it only cost me 2 mins and actually saved me 20 plat since guildie didnt charge, but the principle sucked.<br />
<br />
This is not the first time I have been refused ports because I am a cleric.  I am always polite but apparently they have had bad experiences or something in the past.  I dont blame every druid for bad experiences I have.  <br />
<br />
Speaking of which I know we have our own idiots.   Yes and our own whiners.    I am just curious if this is something that has popped up recently and why it is becoming more prevalent?</div></div><hr />

Very important you realize I dont want flames against anyone.    I want to know if there are hard feeling between clerics and druids and if so what we need to do to work them out.  We are trying to talk to our own stupid people right now.  <br />
<br />
Clerics not rezzing druids and druids not porting clerics is going to make for a very bad gaming experience.  While grouped last nite had a situation where I had just made 49.  Stupid me had not bought resurrection ahead of time.   Beattun a druid in zone got wiped by gore and needed a rez.  I told him I would 75% rez him free or if he wanted to make a run for me I could 90% rez him for free.   He took the later.   I gave him 27 plat--he brought back my spell--he got 90 rez--I got spell hand delivered.  Thing is cleric and druids working together can be strong as was the group I was in, however I see the two communities growing further apart.</div></div><hr />

You never kno when you might need a little good will from a cleric and how would you have them remember you That JERK who charged me 200pp wants a rezz? HAH!

I will always port guildies and friends free of charge, and usually go out of my way to do so (unless grouped, raiding or any other obvious reasons).  <br />
<br />
However, even when I have absolutely nothing to do I will NOT port the lazy schmuck you cannot even be bothered to formulate a tell.  I get this all the time:<br />
<br />
Hail Purestone<br />
&quot;Nexus&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean, do I look like an NPC to you?<br />
No I will not gate you, and if i do not chose to gate you, that is my choice, and no amount of insulting or annoying me will convince me.<br />
If someone sends me a tell in the general format of &quot;port plz&quot;, they will get a declination.  If they persist in a rude manner, and annoy me sufficiently, they will get a gate to CS.  I have no sympathy for anyone who thinks that I am here for the sole purpose of porting you, and that it is not necessary to be polite or form complete sentences when asking me for a favour.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for donations, I would not even consider accepting donations from friends or guildies, and laugh at the suggestion.  If I decide to port someone, I will accept donations, but not charge a set price, or even, if they are polite enough, port them for free.  Occasionaly if i see someone paying 100pp for a port, I will port them (those spells are NOT cheap).</div></div><hr />

I will generally not refuse a port unless on a raid, in a group etc ( however, it is very annoying to be in PoF and have someone ask if you have time for a port- yes, it has happened- D-oh).  I accept any donations and port all classes and races.  I have found one way to not get bothered too much is to have a long name-Cuoracorucia is a bear to spell so most are desperate by the time they get to me because I am either the only one in the zone or the druids/wizzies with shorter names refused them.  Most offer donations, ( Enchanters are always ready to cast KEI in return for a port :) ) but I get stiffed also.  I have a long memory and remember those who stiffed me.  As for the cleric/druid issue, never had it happen on MT and have always had a great relationship with clerics, so no issues on my part.  I think a nice addition to EQ fashion would be a black and yellow checkered tunic druids and wizzies could wear when they are in the mood to play taxi- since most think that we are Norrath's Taxi Service.</div></div><hr />

How hard is it to, if you MUST send a tell, for these nimrods to say &quot;Can you [cast a particular buff|port me to location X] for [Xpp] donation if you have the time?&quot;  In one sentence I know everything I need to know, including whether or not I want to agree or not.<br />

Most times I was fixing to buff them up a bit or at least cast SoW.<br />
<br />
Or how about the stranger who is in a terrible fix and really needs a CR port. So you go out of your way to pick his little self up and run him to his corpse. About 30 minutes later (if that), he's dead again and still hadn't bothered to get a bind nearer to his hunting grounds, so he sends you a tell...<br />
<br />
I bank in RV, so I'm there a lot and there are always a good number of newbies. So I get a tell from a Level 4 Halfling that wants a port to Cabilis. Besides the fact that I don't have a Cabilis port, he's a little low and a little KOS and we get into this big debate about how he has friends there and he needs to group with them...please!<br />
<br />
I've lost more passengers trying to run them through Oasis than I'd care to admit. They all wanted to hunt N Ro or visit Freeport (pre PoP), but they run out of listening ability pretty much on zone in to Oasis and the first thing that smacks them, they totally panic and die instead of making a beeline for the zone with SoW. Then they are usually ticked at me and go right back to Rivervale. Seriously, if you can't get out of RV on your own, you are not ready to leave.<br />
<br />
That's why I don't port much anymore. <br />
<br />
And I only pay 50pp for KEI, I asked more than one Enchanter how much they thought was fair before I settled on that price. Bristlebane Nexus pricing.</div></div><hr />

I dont have to stop and TAKE them somewhere, I just SEND them. I have always TL'd 'chanters, clerics and CR's for free.

<br />
 One the other hand, WC Fields said &quot;No good deed goes unpunished&quot; which I've also found to be true......... Sometimes if you help out some stranger, they put you on their &quot;friends&quot; list, and everytime they need a port, they send you a tell.......</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have one account.  It has both a cleric and druid on it so they cant help each other.    Still the cleric always gets free ports and KEI, the druid always gets free KEI and rezzes.    That is because my ports and rezzes are always free to druids, chanters and clerics.   heck and usually to most other people also.<br />
<br />
But I have especially established a tit for tat with enchanters and druid with my cleric and  with enchanters and clerics with my druid.   There are still occasionally druids who will charge me for a port but they are usually the port ho types who never adventure enough to have need of my rez services.  Same with clerics who charge my druid for rezzes--almost every one is dual accounted with their own porter.<br />
<br />
Develop a rep and live or die by it.<br />
<br />
If I have never helped you before I will definitly donate.   But I usually just send a tell to a friend or do a OOC and get a reply from someone I have cooperated and traded with before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The second time, I gave him 50pp, he gave it back, I gave it again and said &quot;your time and mana is valuable, even to me&quot;. So he kept it.<br />
<br />
I don't want him to feel he &quot;owes&quot; me free KEI, because then he will assume I &quot;owe&quot; him a port whenever, or I &quot;owe&quot; him a rez deep in UP. Inevitably, he will want that port when I am main healer for an OS group, and I will have to tell him no.<br />
<br />
I don't accept free KEI, or free rezzes, if I can help it. Once I open the &quot;scratch each other's back&quot; floodgates, I would never have a spare moment where I wasn't being asked for a port, a rez, or both.</div></div><hr />

There is anther alternative when you are threatened with a train or KS for not porting.  Of course it os one to only use in rare situations as you will be hated for it, lol.  They threaten to train you if you dont port, then tell them you agree, invite, and port to the most desolate, underused, or farthest from there real destination as possible, disband, /ignore, gate. <br />
<br />
Again, its a thing to get a druid a bad name, but training or ksing a dru for not porting is worse.  I wonder if its a bannable offense, or one that would just make a GM frown.<br />

He asked again for the port, i told him straight out No.  Then this guy proceeded to give me a lecture on how rude i was and how he was going to remember me in the future etc etc<br />
<br />
I guess I just cant get over how lazy some poeple can be.  He could have been in GD by the time it took him to ask me for the port a third time.  I hope he remebrs my name, so he does not ask me for ports in the future.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are going to pay for a port, TL, rez, buff, etc i tihnk you ought to just come out and say exactly what you are willing to pay for the service rather then just say &quot;donation&quot;  Anyone who tells me donation gets ignored.  If you want my services and are going to pay for them, you can come and say what you are paying right out front.  I never have any trouble getting rezzes or buffs (clarity fo some form) because i always comew right out and say what i am paying.  Usually 50 plat for a C3 or better, and 100 plat for rezzes, and i increase the amount i am offering the longer i wait with no response and it always works for me.</div></div><hr />

Good.<br />

I have always been one who likes to help people out.  If someone is really in a bind, the ability to travel, and take others with you, becomes quite handy.<br />
<br />
I have always been annoyed by the people who EXPECT us to port them.  Okay, maybe one port wouldn't take all my playing time.  But what about the other 500 Joe Blows standing nearby wanting a port?  If I did it every time, it wouldn't be one lost newbie hounding me, it would be them ALL.  THEN it WOULD take all my play time.<br />
<br />
One thing that has gotten to me worse than anything:<br />
<br />
You have entered Burning Woods<br />
Newbie tells you, Hey any chance I could get a port?<br />
/w all Nebie<br />
Newbie (Level 1) Class Race Zone: Newbie City 1<br />
/tell Newbie Where are you trying to go?<br />
LOADING... PLEASE WAIT<br />
You have entered Newbie Area One<br />
Newbie tells you, Gfay<br />
You begin to cast a spell<br />
You are surrounded by a brief lupine aura<br />
/tell Newbie You don't know the way there?<br />
Newbie tells you, Yes, but it's such a long run<br />
/tell Newbie kk almost there<br />
LOADING... PLEASE WAIT<br />
You have entered Newbie City 1<br />
Newbie tells you, Can we stop by PoK<br />
<br />
**********Screeching halt******************<br />
<br />
Now why did this person have me come all the way to where they were, when they could have just used the damn book?  I mean, they were wanting to go straight from one newbie zone to another.  The book does that.<br />
<br />
Now, not knowing they had PoP, I have wasted time, and more importantly, KEI, to come get them.<br />
<br />
Once or twice don't bother ya when it's a REAL newbie, not just someone with a low alt.  Then again, the way I look at it, very few real newbies would send that tell, unless someone was looking over their shoulder telling them what to do.<br />
<br />
The whole port thing has been bad at times, but when someone has the odasity to ask me to come pick them up because they are too damn lazy to find the book....<br />

<br />
I'm a druid. I port. However, if i am busy, i dont like to be bothered. I love random tells from people all the way across norrath asking for a pick up, port to somewhere, wait for them, and port them back. Why do these people even bother?<br />
<br />
I also love it when i sit in nexus, and another druid is /oocing that they are porting for a fee. Why do people then bother me for a port, when clearly, someone is providing that service?<br />
<br />
The other day i was in POK, and some guy kept /shouting for a port. I proceed to tell him to take the port stones. He then replies that i'm a stupid uber twink that dont care about other people. Hmm. seeing as this is my main character, that i started from scratch, i didnt really appreciate that comment. He proceeded to /shout for a port. Some people are really silly, why waste time and money, when you can take a POK port stone? especially when you're a sower class? <br />
<br />
i just dont understand how people think sometimes. If i am not doing anything, i will gladly provide any service that i can. I dont like to accept donations for ports, and i almost never ask to port for donations ( unless i'm complete entirely broke)<br />
<br />
People should understand that NOT ALL druids and wizards want to be taxis. With POK around and Nexus, life has already been made simpler for non porting classes. take advantage of it!!!<br />

Being in a few good guilds since i started palying this game has probably helped my outlook somewhat tho.<br />
<br />
altho i can remember a time haveing a debate with someone about porting them from lava to sro (there are so many zones in between, 3 i think) all i can say is lazy (this was pre lucin even)<br />
<br />
i did go and do the quest for the spell temperance so i could buff all the impaitence people who didn't want to wait for a full group to get aego when selling buffs in pok<br />
<br />
but i think for someone who demands a port the best place would be SF with wizzies you can see where the tl is too but druids you just get the blank screen then the zone u have entered<br />
<br />
but when i go near newbee zones i usually go role anyway, as far as refuseing to do a rez or demanding a donation, never, altho i do usually ask how much a person is willing to pay if i get a tell asking for a rez in another zone than i am in (altho i don't usually refuse whatever they offer) guildees and friends excepted<br />
<br />
the thing i hate is when in a pickup exp group w/o a chanter and the people expect me to go to pok or nexus and pay for c3 so i can heal and buff them quicker (less down time medding), no way it costs me enough for the dots to buff them i'm not going to pay for a c3 also for their benifit.<br />

the reason i came here in the first place was to look at a druid epic write up to see what i need, but spent the time reading this thread haha<br />

LS them accross to here... blah blah blah... <br />
<br />
I dont charge for ports.. donations only.. and I usually cancel those too. <br />
<br />
Had a guy as for a port once said he would donate... once we grouped up he said that he did have any money on this char because it was an alt and that he was sorry.. and he would understand if I didnt want to port him.. I said Naw.. wasnt doing anything anyways... and that it was no problem. (gee musta been in a good mood that day :P)  after the port was completed, my trade screen poped up and there was this weapon that he offered me that I later sold in the bazaar for some NICE plat... <br />
<br />
so sometimes it is good to be generous..and sometimes it is a pain in the arse! hahaha</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, I am alway in /role mode. And if the player didn't have say the pp he want to pay, I realy get to say no, sorry. And if the price don't interest me, I say no too (like he is in a dangerous zone 5 zone away from a druid ring; I can't get back easily to my hunting groung; I need to port out anyway; I am grouped; and some other factors).<br />

Was in a good mood from getting skillups and was heading to PoK anyway, so I sent him a tell saying I'd been afk and asking if he still needed port. He said he didn't have money on this char (a newborn trader mule) and swore up and down I'd get money from an ogre when he got there, and asked how much I wanted. Whatever it was worth to him (my default answer), ported up and an ogre handed me 200 pp. It's nice when karma smiles back at you :)</div></div><hr />
