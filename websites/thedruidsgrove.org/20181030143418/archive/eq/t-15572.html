<br />
The spell is primarly useful to handle many adds at the same time.  This allows us to work around our inability to Harmony indoor zones somewhat provided you can back up so the mobs come at you in a direct line.<br />
<br />
What do other people think of it after using it?<br />

 <br />
Perhaps in a casual indoor zone where there isnt as much danger this would allow group rooting of mobs so you can get them all snared so you can kite them, but again this method is a far cry from FD pulling.<br />
 <br />
I have vinelash cascade rk 2 and i dont really use it for splitting..if i see the puller incoming with an add ill vinelash cascade both mobs and that really helps the enchanter..giving them time to mezz the add and the tank time to build a bit of agro with stun (i usually grp w a pally)<br />
 <br />
In this respect i agree that this spell is useful to handle adds, but to be safe you better still have a different pulling method in mind. imo its more useful to use it on a bad pull as an assist for crowd control, or replacement for CC if no CC is available rather than risk using this to pull multiple mobs in a dangerous zone. <br />
 <br />
As a rule of thumb not many druids kite indoors, and not many groups like to see 3 or 4 mobs agro'd at a time</div></div><hr />

Have used it mainly in The Buried Sea as a pulling/cc ability. Also worked well on Redfang in DPoB.<br />
<br />
Don't know of it's value in a more serious group situation, but i've found it useful in the Bone aug quest thingy i've been doing all week.</div></div><hr />

Pack of mobs coming in on the group, face the pack and cast VC, 1.5 secs later, they are stuck. Let the tank grab one and start killing. Reroot the pack while they are still rooted, and you can hold the crowd at bay without them surrounding you. Okay. Might work. So is my theory put to practice?  Still don't have the spell, slacker Druid that I am.</div></div><hr />

I did just this on the Final Druid 1.5 fight, rooted 8 of the 10 trees and was able to stagger the rest fairly well.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Personally i was recently working on the bone augment task and i was doing one of the murderous mal tasks where i needed to deliver a package to silverlip slim. Sounded easy enough so i ran over to Barren Coast, did the turn in, and WHAM found myself ambushed by 3 mobs and i was at 15% health by the time i managed to get un-stunned and hit Exodus.<br />
 <br />
I havent tried yet but im thinking vinelash cascade would work great here...simply do the turn in, VC the mobs as they are incoming and that would buy me lots of time to get the situation under control</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">03-03-2007, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this spell. It's saved my group several times since I've gotten it. See a bunch of mobs running after the group, bam, all rooted. I normally evac pull to single pull indoors, but that doesn't work in places you aren't able to get back to group from succor point. This spell has helped a bunch with that. I root the group with it, snare the one I want using ensnare (I wish mire thorns could be used over this root), then use a very low lvl DD to break and so they don't summon me, combust works well, and you have yourself a single pull. I generally overwrite vinelash with another root that lasts longer if they need to stay put more than half a minute. I never got my roots AAs since I do crowd control with root very frequently. I sometimes already have problems breaking root fast enough as is, so not sure this will work for those of you with the root AAs. You could always root the others and wait 30 seconds for vinelash to wear off I guess. It's also damn fun when farming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Needs to be the DD root - Rangers get same spell and while Vinelash by them helps keep the bats in place, will not kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shruella</div><div class="date">01-15-2008, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It works wonderfully on Redfang, and during the Mayong encounter as well.<br />
 <br />
The DD component isnt what kills them, it's the combination of being mezzed and rooted at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nduma</div><div class="date">01-17-2008, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm interesting - we've had rangers use Vinelash and it not work. I know for a fact that the mob does not have to be mezzed for the the root to kill it. Recently we've had Voracious bats chase our kiters, I've rooted those running bats away from any mez and they've died (with our DD root). It dies a few seconds after being rooted, not when the root lands/DD fires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weolyen</div><div class="date">01-21-2008, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always thought that the bats had to be *unmezzed* for the root to banish them, although I never tested explicitly for it.<br />
 <br />
It would explain the reports of why people think Vinelash doesn't work, since I suspect most guilds AE/viral mezz the bats on spawn.  Roots with a DD component will obviously break the mezz, allowing for the banish script to trigger.<br />
 <br />
Our guild finished with Demi quite a while ago, I'd be interested if someone could prove my musings one way or the other.  If I'm right, any old root will work to banish the bats, as long as it isn't mezzed.</div></div><hr />
