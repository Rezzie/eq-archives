Whats good about the druid is that it can adapt to the situation.  If you find yourself on the advantage versus cloth, switch to cat.  If your in combat versus heavy armor, go bear or root and nuke.  I see a lot of druids that get in a form and stay there through an entire fight.  This amazes me.  Even in PVE I see it.<br />
<br />
If BG's are your thing, I suggest a strong moonkin build or a 14/32/5 feral build.  If you go feral, you'll be shifting often to heal or change from cat to bear depending on the target.  If your moonkin...I read this is basically a moonfire spam fest.  In Alterac, you can also hurricane for some nice area dmg that boosts your HK's.  <br />
<br />
Whatever you do.  Just don't be alone and avoid 1v1's. It's just an invitation for a 2nd or 3rd to jump in and finish you off. That is the biggest mistake people make in BG's.</div></div><hr />

Wrath is more mana efficient. Effective use of OOC is key for a Moonkin to to become Oomkin. I typically only spam moonfire when the victim is near death and I am low on health as well. Otherwise I open with Starfire (hope for a stun) moonfire, Wrath. Usually one of those will crit giving a 1 sec wrath following the crit with NG. If my Starfire does stun I can usually get two wraths off and a moonfire before FF and melee. My PVP experience is limited, but this seems to work well for me. GW has better insight on moonkin as I am new to the build.</div></div><hr />

Where you are too close for them to use their arrows/guns but too far for them to meele you.  Root them, nuke them and continue.  Either ignore or sleep the pet.<br />
<br />
As Wulfgor said, take advantage of your shifting.  You never stay in a form the ENTIRE fight as you just limit yourself.  Often I'll stalk my prey in cat ( stealthed ), pounce and get some combo points to get them bleeding, shift, heal ( if needed ) root, more dots, and bear them down ( bashing, shifting to heal and back to bear as needed ).<br />
<br />
In BGs you WILL get ganged up on.  You will die.  A LOT.  Learn to deal with it and use it to your advantage.  When there are 3 or so on you it means there's nobody on someone else who can be capturing a flag, a resource node or a graveyard/tower.  <br />
<br />
I find in AB &amp; AV I am the first one they come looking for ( perhaps I have made a name with some of them, I'm not sure :D ).  I can drag out 2 or 3 beating on me for a min or so ( healing and healing and healing ) to where it distracts them from what they should be doing ( getting/protecting the flag ).  Yes, you'll die, and a lot too, but that's how it goes :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-13-2006, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres a different way to look at it:<br />
<br />
Find a hunter buddy, and stay near him.  Root everything you see, FF rogues, sleep other hunters pets and put Insect Swarm on every melee class you can.  And it doesn't hurt to heal other people every now and then.  If you see another druid in bear or cat, sleep them.  IMO Druid is the best support class in the game (and a very strong solo class as well).  Played with another of any skill this duo can be deadly.  <br />
<br />
Its really fun to just root a warrior or something in place, throw some DoT's on him, and watch your hunter buddy standing right next to you hit him in the face with arrows while you get the kill and barely broke a sweat.  Hunters are absolutley deadly in PvP if they can snipe.<br />
<br />
As soon as people notice the ass whooping that you two are handing out, they will certainly come for you.  This is when you throw on NG, get into bear and wait for two of them to attack you.  One will get rooted, while you handle the other with relative ease.  If there are more than 2 on you, or 4 on you and your buddy, this is good.  You can last a while, taking their attention from what they should be doing - gathering resources, or paying attention to the flag carrier.  In AV I, another druid and a priest have turned many battles by keeping melee classes healed while all the mages/hunters/rogues do what they do.  <br />
<br />
If this isnt your playstyle, do what you enjoy most.  I ran in forms in BG's for a long time, and realized that I died a LOT, and while the few solo / squishy kills taht I got were satisfying, my dying that much wasn't really helping us win.  I guess that I just like healing and helping out my team, rather than trying to do it alone.  I have had the most HK's and least deaths in AB a lot of times doing this.  But again, do whatever is most satisfying and fun for your playstyle :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm no BG master at all, I dont have as much time as I would like to devote to WoW (damn 8-5 job =/ ), and right now most of it is being directed toward gearing up in MC, which will inevitably help me in the BG's.  There are many others on this forum with far more BG experience than I.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-13-2006, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget that healing generates a lot of threat and if you are on a persons &quot;threat list&quot; when they die you get an honor kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">04-13-2006, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clari has some great points. I am usually always running around with a warrior or shaman, rarely do I ever get caught alone. BG's is all about teamwork and less about individual effort. Figure out ways to help your team out without exposing yourself or becoming a prime target. Healing will put you high on the other team's &quot;must kill&quot; list for certain, but with decent backup you can usually win out when they charge you.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few threads in these forums already on how to deal with certain classes, so I am going to save myself some time and not rehash all the different strats. Just search the forums and the pvp section.</div></div><hr />
