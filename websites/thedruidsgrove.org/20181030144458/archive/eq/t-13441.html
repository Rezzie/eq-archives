<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fourchette</div><div class="date">03-04-2006, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone done the mission after the skin quest? When you turn in your skins in PoK, you get Barkspur and a mission (forget the name). <br />
 <br />
The problem for most will be that the mission is tagged as a group mission, so you won't be able to get any instances that show up via alt-Q while working on it. This makes it very difficult to complete for someone who raids (I had to delete the mission myself), but also makes it where you can't do other missions in DoN, Anguish, DoDH, etc., while you work on it. I'm guessing that it's a bug and should be flagged as a solo task.<br />
 <br />
The next problem with it is... if you decline the mission, or cancel it, there doesn't seem to be a way to get it again without re-doing the original skin quest. I tried handing in my 'old skins' to Maelin again, he wouldn't take them.<br />
 <br />
Perhaps this is for the group heal and is what's been reported as being broken?</div></div><hr />

The issues you have stated are supposed to be fixed per Absor on the patch which is currently set for 3/14/06</div></div><hr />

How did you find this out?<br />
<br />
I visited Sony's forums but didn't see this or anything about a patch.<br />
<br />
Just one of my many complaints about their lack of communication with us.  Making us search for info like this is stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-04-2006, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absor made several posts about the quest on the vet forum.</div></div><hr />

Ah, see, I thought with the name The Veterans Lounge (Non-Newbie Discussion), that it was for experienced players to chat about the game.<br />
<br />
I didn't realize that the Veterans Forum has taken over the duties of the The Town Crier (Announcements), Update Notes, Developer's Corner and Tech Support forums but a quick look on my part shows that it has.<br />
<br />
Sorry, my fault for being stupid enough to think that Sony would actually use the forums they created for the uses that they are titled. :)</div></div><hr />

Not picking on you but Sony.<br />
<br />
And the reason that he didn't make a general announcement about it in the proper forum is....<br />
<br />
the information could be used by Iran to make nuclear weapons?<br />
<br />
Heaven forbid that they actually keep the players informed about what's going on in the game.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, do you really want to defend them in their lack of communication?<br />
<br />
They have made forums for the SOLE purpose of telling us this stuff and then instead of posting this stuff there, they post it in Veteran?<br />
<br />
I do my part in actually looking for the proper forum to find out some information.  Why can't they do theirs by posting the information there?  How hard is it to cut and paste that exact message to the proper forum?<br />
<br />
I mean would you defend a company that says to call X number for billing help and then they decide to do billing help in the Tech support phone number Y instead and have no one answer the phone X for billing?  That is exactly what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Whatever, move this to rant because every time we point out the failure of Sony to do the most basic business stuff that should be learned in Business 101, we are accused of being negative and just ranting on like a crazy person.  Imagine expecting a business to do the basic stuff right, what a concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you reconsider if they sent you private messages with all the little changes they are about to make?<br />
<br />
The announcement forums are there to make big announcements: expansions, changes to fees, huge patches, and so on. Fixes to bugs and little issues (which means not concerning a HUGE part of EverQuest as a whole) being bitched at in the Veteran forums get the dev replies. This is done ironically to reach the very same people that are bitching about X bug and to communicate &quot;better&quot; with the custumer base that is having said problems.<br />

Super easy to click.<br />
<br />
And yes, I am defending them on this particular topic. Someone has to take the opposite side of discussions otherwise it would be very boring :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">03-07-2006, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, Nimchip, here goes.<br />
<br />
Let's take the person who needs the most help, someone new to all this.   So they go here: http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/<br />
<br />
And, they want to know when the next game update is scheduled and what might be in it.  So, being a logical person, they click: <br />
<br />
Game Updates  (third from top on left side, under Home and Forums)<br />
<br />
Which takes them here: http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/game_updates.vm<br />
<br />
Which lists the patch messages for the past two years.  But the information they are seeking says the following:<br />
<br />
Upcoming Updates  <br />
 <br />
To be announced!<br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
And guess what?  It's said &quot;To be announced&quot; for months now.  Does it say the information that Fenier reported, &quot;The issues you have stated are supposed to be fixed per Absor on the patch which is currently set for 3/14/06&quot;<br />
<br />
Nope, doesn't say there is a patch set for 3/14/06.  Doesn't say what might be in the patch.  Doesn't say anything.<br />
<br />
As for your comment that it is easy to find out this stuff if you look, guess what, to create this post, I went looking for the information that Fenier reported so I could claim that Absor (or someone) should have just also posted it in the Upcoming Updates and I couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
I did a search for all posts Absor has done in the past few days and couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
So please tell me how dumb I am that I couldn't find such &quot;easy to find if you want to&quot; information.<br />
<br />
The wonderful &quot;Dev Tracker&quot; that you love is full of dozens of posts that I would have to slog through to find out a simple fact, i.e., when is the next patch and what will be in it.<br />
<br />
Of course, they can have a disclaimer that the patch date and what will be in it is subject to change.  But at least have something there.<br />

<br />
An announcement of when the next patch is and what might be in it isn't important?  An announcement that the pathing bug, which EVERYONE is experiencing and most people have no idea what is going on with it, isn't important?  So the fact that I can't find 95% of the traders in the Bazaar when I click find trader isn't important to EverQuest as a whole?  The fact that mobs are warping on everyone all over the place because of the pathing bug isn't important to EQ as a whole?<br />
<br />
I guess you think that 99% of the players should be treated as mushrooms (kept in the dark and fed crap) and that only the 1% that spend hours reading the veteran forum deserve to know what is going on.  The poor slob who has a real life and just has a few moments to jump to the EQ web site to see if there is a patch soon to fix those bugs and if Sony knows about them can just lump it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ngeth, the tradeskill dev mentioned it would be the 14/15 of March in the tradeskill forum in reponse to a issue concerning the use of Shimmering Steel in research quests.<br />
<br />
I have no life, and I read 90 percent of all dev posts.<br />

Got a good giggle thanks!<br />
<br />
And I agree with her, the very least they could do is update the &quot;upcoming updates&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However I must ask, what do you intend to do about it? There's a board strictly for the website EQplayers here: http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=eqplayers<br />
I'm not sure if they take feedback on updating content or if that's a Kytherea job - however it's a start. Quite frankly we don't know who handles the web content but I'm pretty sure the devs don't bother much on that. I suggest posting some comments there regarding the &quot;upcoming updates&quot; static TBA.<br />
<br />
If anything I would say this is lack of communication between the devs and the web teams.</div></div><hr />

The idea of actually being constructive and trying to fix these things is foreign to me :).  But I have made a post there and let's see what happens.<br />

Thanks for the suggestion.</div></div><hr />
