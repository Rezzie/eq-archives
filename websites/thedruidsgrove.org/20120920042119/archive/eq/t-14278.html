I think i spent the most on 67's at 7500 each the 68's were 4k each and 66's were 5500each roughly.</div></div><hr />

If you can afford to wait a month, I'd say do it.  Supposedly, the first level of all spells are going to be widely available, and I can only assume the first level will at least be better than current spells.<br />
