I agree with the complaint here. Many people bring in Druids as &quot;back up&quot; healers but they are limited in their healing capability as well as a couple of other small oversights.<br />
<br />
1. With the current spell distribution it is difficult for a druid to actually serve as an efficient healer or &quot;nuker&quot;. While they are potent, they are not focused enough to properly serve their function and in the eyes of too many, are simply a portal system to different areas and not good for much else.<br />
On a whole, Druids are barely ahead of Paladins in their Healing capacity. And, while the regeneration buffs are certainly beneficial, they do not make up for the fact that Druids gain Greater Healing at 29 and then must wait until 51 (twenty-two levels!!!) to get Superior Healing. This curses them with a huge valley of difficulties until they hit 51, and even then they are so far behind in the healing ability that they can only function for emergency heals.<br />
In short. Druids are supposed to be nature's guardians. They are the healers of the land and nurturers of the weak and helpless. They are the oldest form of healer and know methods which Clerics could never hope to grasp.<br />
I am not saying that Druids should surpass Clerics in the healing ability but, by all rights, they should stand right beside them in that ability. <br />
I would suggest giving them the same HEAL spell distribution up to 53 (where Clerics receive Divine Light) and give Druids their own versions of the spells after Superior Healing, perhaps a tad less powerful but still granting them the capability to function as healers.<br />
<br />
2. The charm animal spells are handy but they are fairly useless at lower levels. Most young Druids who try to charm animals to attack for them end up with two MOBs because the spell duration is pathetically short. On this, I really don't know what is the best way to approach it but you need to keep in mind that Druids are a part of nature and rivaled in this claim by no one... not even the Rangers (who also have a great deal of problems but that's for another day).<br />
Animals of all kinds allow Druids to pass because of a deep seeded knowledge that the Druids are their guardians and protectors.<br />
In old texts and most fantasy, druids are known to be followed by beasts of all kind. These beasts (wolves, bears, birds and deer) protected the Druids and would lay down their lives for them.<br />
Honestly, I think that Druids should be allowed to have a pet similar to what the Enchanters have. A new summoning every few levels of a CONTROLLED pet. Perhaps varying the pet type according to race...<br />
EX:<br />
Elves would receive Wolf pets<br />
Halfelves would receive Lions<br />
Humans would receive Grizzly Bears<br />
Halflings would receive Badgers or Skunks (something relative to their size)<br />
As they increase in levels and obtain new versions of the Summon Animal spell, the animal will be more and more powerful to actually pose a threat to MOBs like the pet of any other class.<br />
Perhaps this is just me but I think that druids need this change as well.<br />
<br />
3. Last on my list of grievances is the Druid's (and Ranger's) limitation within an indoor environment.<br />
I can understand the inability to cast such spells as Invoke Lightning, Treeform, Stinging Swarm and Careless Lightning in an indoor environment as these require Earth, Weather and wildlife to call on but I see no reason for them to be unable to cast such spells as Harmony, Spirit of Wolf, Wolf Form or any Wind Based spell as these are totally irrelevant. The loss of Harmony indoors is a total joke... period. As for Wolf Form, that is a shapechanging ability that is &quot;innate&quot; to the druid that simply reconstructs their body. Spirit of Wolf calls upon a spirit to charge someone with the dexterity, speed and agility (faster running) of a wolf... and with the amount of ghosts, spirits and spectres I have seen indoors....<br />
I say leave the Wind Based spells and Fire based spells because they simply require oxygen, which is all around, even in a dungeon.<br />
By taking these spells from Druids (and Rangers) you are destroying their usefulness in the indoor environments and cutting their abilities almost in half, leaving them in a bad position when they want to go after XP or items indoors. This, over all is a wholly unfair drawback that has needed to be addressed for a long while now.<br />
<br />
I have said my piece.. I hope it helps.<br />

I definetly think verant should implement your changes. They are well thought out, presented nicely, and defended with a skill that makes my ac look like a necro's charisma. But I would like to ask a few questions and present a few suggestions...<br />
<br />
1. I agree that druids should be able to be the backup healer for a raid, or the main healer of an exp group. While I do enjoy out healing you, it does show that you are unbalanced. However, what was the healing penalty you mentioned? Ive never noticed it, so you may be asking to have something removed that doesnt exist. Or i might be a moron, my int is kinda low...<br />
<br />
2. You're right about PotG needing an upgrade. Ive never even had it cast on me, which implies that something is up.<br />
<br />
3. Dots... the epic dot does need to be changed. A druid friend of mine was quite peeved when a giant rat resisted her epic proc (though that could have been a GM controlled rat for all i know). And while you should get an upgrade to your dot after 53 (it doesnt make sense that you have to use a 53 level spell on 65+ mobs), dont forget that if you are THE secondary healer, tershiary nuker, evacer, etc class, shaman's should be the buffer/DoT class. While I admit that im no expert, i think it just makes sense that way. Which is more damageing, a swarm of bees or a poison that dissolves your blood? (or whatever shaman do) But by the same token, the life force of the forest being blasted into someone should be more beneficial than that voodoo that shammies do so well. <br />
<br />
I believe thats everything. I support your cause, and i hope i voiced my opinion half as well as you did, but its also terribly late here so if i messed up somewhere, dont blame me, blame Canada.</div></div><hr />

I hope Verant takes this to heart for once, I really feel usless since the release of Luclin.  <br />
<br />
But let's also face the fact that if Verant makes this change our spells will probably drop off of uber mobs that only large guilds will be able to kill and with Verants vision of an economy in the game people will start charging outrageous sums of money for the spells so a poor druid will have a fine time getting the spells (unless you belong to a uber guild.

Sharafi-<br />
<br />
Most of your entire post is completely irrelevant to anything discussed so far in this thread. First, you rant about giving other classes abilities they do not possess currently in ANYWAY, trying to somehow compare that to the small upgrades to spells druids currently DO possess. Not a very intelligent argument.<br />
<br />
&quot;The druid class is primarily a wanderer type class, hmm why does that name ring a bell they are loners hunting in outside zones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please, wake up. Verant is trying to steer the game towards more people grouping and LESS soloing. From your comment you obviously don't take that into account.<br />
<br />
Ushasa -<br />
<br />
Druids aren't asking to be able to port everywhere in Luclin. Just the Nexus.<br />
<br />
And on your DoT comment, you obviously don't play a druid. A) increased DoT damage would result from increased mana cost, still leaving it working out about the same for soloing, while improving DoT damage a little for groups, B) You can stack certain DoTs of the same line, i.e. WD and Drones.<br />
<br />
As far as healing, giving better heals would only bump them up to secondary healers, which they are NOT currently, so no more irrelevant comments to that effect. More efficient single target healers does NOT = easier soloing. They didn't say 'Give us a 1000pt heal that casts in 2 seconds'. What they're asking for is to keep them in line with the role of secondary healer. Please, be my guest and TRY to heal a 5khp tank with Chloroblast. RARELY does it even noticeably boost their HP, since it's being taken as fast as it is gained. Nature's Touch doesn't change this fact, it simply ends up costing more mana and druids run out just as fast, and end up doing just as little healing.<br />
<br />
They are NOT trying to make a god class. Everyone who disagrees with the Statement at the beginning of this thread is more than likely missing the 'second best' attitude and role that Druids hope to attain. It was always their role before, they are merely trying to retain that ability.<br />
<br />
Actually think out the suggestions presented, and compare them to other class abilities, and people might just be less likely to post more irrational, ill-thought out, class envy nerf-the-druids diatribe.<br />

I've played nothing but a druid since playing EQ.  While I agree with the high end druid, one of the things that frustrates me to no end is the lack of viability for me to do quests.  I look at rangers, paladins, clerics, warriors and such, and see tons of class-specific quests for them starting in the lower levels, all for decent items.  I look at the druid and most of the druid-only quests have either had the items nerfed or wiped out of the game.  As such, I rarely quest until my mid-40s.  The only quests I have actually attempted to do beforehand is the Testament of Vanear quest and the Tunare initiate-warden quests.  And as everyone knows, those are not druid-only.  Even with the addition of Kunark, no quests were really given especially for druids other than undesirable equipment (like Charm Plant and the handy shilelagh?).  I wish there were better quests for druids before the epic or Velious/Luclin armors.<br />

I have progressively encountered similiar set backs when trying to find a roll within a group and I am only just hitting the high-end group levels as my druid is 56th level. Considering verant has stated in the past that he wants to encourage everyone to group the druid class is very much finding themselves a character on the outside looking in. Thank god we can atleast solo otherwise there would be no point in playing a druid at all. For this such reason I am sorry to say I recently began switching my focus to my chanter since I have no problem finding groups with him. Hopefully verant can make such changes as stated in the original document so the desire to play my druid comes back to me.<br />

The new moonfire spell isn't remotely attractive.  And our 'backup' healing ability is a joke compared to the abilities of paladins in the high end game.  I especially agree with a single person version of potg, but also an upgrade to potg.  PotG used to be a great contribution for druid's to make in the high-end game.  With the upgrades to all the other self-mana buffs and hp buffs, Druid's are once again fallen off the chart.  We are not the class that we once were and we have seen merely passing attention in the expansions.  Druid's need help from VI.  Druid's need a voice there.  If there isn't someone in those offices talking about druid's than you should take the comments here under serious advisement.</div></div><hr />

Ok on a seriouse note tho I very much agree druids could use a lot of help but i do think with circle of seasons that we get great fire / cold resists in a single spell for the whole group I wouldnt change that. I would love to see some upgrades to heal spells I would also like to see us get some form of agro controll sence almost every class that class a dd spell (lol and even rangers and cleric)get one nothing like what an enchanter gets of course but something to put us lower on the agro list. I like dishing out damadge myself but even on raids with many tanks beating on a npc i have to space my nukes so i dont get splattered by the mob this decreases how much damadge i can do on a raid significantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Comparatively, for 200 mana a Shaman can heal 1,200 hitpoints in 24 seconds (30 seconds when you add the six-second cast time for Torpor).<br />
<br />
You were talking about raids.  Torpor adds on a snare and slow component to it's heal.  It's not a practical heal for tanks on a raid (where you making the comparison).  I doubt that it's all that much of a benefit to cast on tanks in a regular exp group, either.....unless we are talking about during downtime.  Torpor is also an extremely rare spell (costs 40-60k on my server) that is a level 60 spell (raiding on levels 51-59, the best healing that Shamans have is Chloroblast).<br />
<br />
Effectively, in terms of healing, Shamans and Druids are in the same boat.  When you over-exagerate the situation of the Druid vs. the Shaman, you don't make yourself look reasonable, IMO.<br />
<br />
But, at it's core, I agree with most of what you are saying, here.  I think that secondary healers should be able to regain their status as.....effective secondary healers.  I also think that you touched on some other valid problems, as well.<br />

I find myself not wanting to go to my Guild's raids because I am basically just tagging along and adding a little damage.  And this is at level 59 when all other classes have their specialties already well defined.  Many people who have never played a Druid past level 50 would make the argument that because we can solo we should accept this penalty as a price for being able to do just that.  With that particular attatude I completely disagree.  I have met players from every class with the possible exception of Warrior who solo as well, if not better than I do.  A particular Wizard in my Guild routinely quads mobs in the Grey.  This is the class that they just handed an increase in all Direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
Now, I do not subscribe to the philosophy that some other classes do that if someone is better than you are at something that they should be penalized for it.  Rather, I believe that each class has its strong points and weaknesses.  It is, rather, my opinion that its past due time for Verant to recognize the fact that while they have gone out of their way to make all other classes more powerful (disciplines for meelee, Critical Blasts for Wizards, increaseing the effectiveness of pets) they have done next to nothing to improve the effectiviness of our class.  I am not asking Verant to bring us back to where we were 3 years ago when the game came out and we could effectively dot/snare kyte mobs for full damage with very little risk.  I am merely asking them to improve our effectiveness as a class to make us more desireable in a raid situation.<br />
<br />
I love playin my Druid and would never give him up, but I have considered starting an alternate charecter several times so I would be a contributing member of a raid for more than just ports and fire/cold resistance buffs.<br />

<br />
/Add my thoughts:<br />
<br />
Druids are usually comparable to shamen. We have too many similarities, but after Luclin is out, Shamen growed faster than druids.<br />
<br />
Before Luclin:<br />
1. Druid is the best group regrowth buffer<br />
2. Druid PoTG rules against Shaman's any buff<br />
<br />
Now, shamen got same group regen ability with us, AND on buffing section, shamen's group focus RULE us badly, their focus can give even more hp than PoTG, a lot of boost of the stat helping melees on fight, and most importantly, they STACK with Aego/Group Aego.<br />
<br />
Another trivial observation on comparing druid/shaman can be seen on powerleveling, at lower level of a melee about level 40 or under, a druid should probably perform the best (by DS/Regen/Heal, but on level 41 or above, shaman rules against druid (Regen/Haste/Slow/Heal). That reflects against higher level mobs, druid's ability to help causing damage becomes minimal on supporting melees.<br />
<br />
What I can see is the obvious upgrade for druid after luclin is Circle of Season(FR/CR buff), but it mainly helps you on hunting in old places like ToV, which will soon become obsolote when drops become even better in many luclin zones, and the new CT.<br />
<br />
I have to admit druid still have almost the excellent solo ability among all classes (maybe except necro). But the evolution of this game is going to push us more on our solo field as our contribution in a group is badly not enough by lack of new spells.<br />
<br />
So I will be negative on asking a new DoT (it's just another boost for solo, such a heavy dot will just cause group annoying when you take off aggro. In ubber fights, usually DD is preferable)<br />
<br />
I will think the succor problem has solved some of the luclin teleporting issues, but I'm sure it's another mistake made by VI, increase our ability while we are as low as level 18 =) makes our case even worse. You know how druid is useful and power at low levels but just too bad on high-end.<br />
<br />
Healing is the main issue, yes we need to make a larger amount of heal, or a group heal/group nature recovery. However, under the current framework, larger amount of heal can hardly be done as it's upwardly bounded by the divine light spell of cleric. Nature Touch is right now just a longer casting time, costing more mana and less healing effects compared with divine light. Without making changes on cleric, druid probably won't grant for faster heal or larger heal (than divine light), and larger heal shouldn't solve the problem as mentioned that our mana for healing is just not efficient at all.<br />
<br />
For Buffing &amp; Debuffing, YES, I think improvement should be MADE HERE. This is the area that you make yourself useful in a raid/group, but doesn't benefit much while you are soloing.<br />
<br />
Let's get into buffing first, Stacking problem on PoTG is serious. However, the problem couldn't be solved by neither group aego or PoTG overwrite each other because it will become the time the clerics gonna complain.<br />
<br />
I dunno if it can be practically done. How about if VI could make these 2 ubber buffs stacked, but when they stacked together, the hp buff and ac buff effect will not be double added to the receiver, that means when you got 2 buffs on, you get the ac buff + hp buff + symbol buff + mana regen buff.<br />
<br />
Another way is change the components in PoTG, e.g. the effect of PoTG is 3 effects:<br />
1. 6 points of mana regen per tick<br />
2. All resists + 10<br />
3. 8hp regen per tick<br />
<br />
Then PoTG and Aego can stack well =) even with the shamen focus. That balance out all our priest classes buffage can stick along each other.<br />
<br />
For debuff section, I think a MR debuff will be non-balance ~_~ so, we need to get more Cold resist debuff where we don't have much on it. I have a fun idea is that druid can get a debuff to against npc's AE/proc, make their AE/proc less chance to hit players... just a thought.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I forsee some changes on druid for sure. I have got my druid into 60 early and I really feel that druid is just the best money earner in the game, selling TP, selling buffs, selling PoTG, selling PL on low levels, quading in CS for a lot of gems/tailoring supplies etc for money and xp. Solo again =(<br />

I a lvl 40 bard of saryrn have also noticed how the druid class has become unbalanced, the fact is in DL people perfer most shamans/clerics over druids, why, shaman=healing/buffs, cleric=ch, and although druids do have buffs they do not compete with the shaman who have buffs, and canabalize (faster mana regen= more heals) I hope this campaign to solve some problems of this class is looked at very carefully by verant, and changes will be made accordingly. I dont know much about the druid class, but i do know when i have 1.1k mana and a creature hitting around 100 hp a piece a 245hp heal is not enough to keep me alive, for an exteneded amount of time, this by experience...<br />

As for druids being broken... I think we are a jack-of-all trades. We can take the place of several classes in a group when there is room for only one. The biggest problem is there are so many bad druids. Or portbots out there that many people dont realize how beneficial a druid can be.</div></div><hr />

seems like druids get the shaft along with us wizzies eh?<br />
<br />
I agree with everything except the druid to luclin port.  For one, it just doesn't seem like it'd be a druid port, I can't explain it, but it just doesn't seem like that to me.<br />
<br />
Second, yes wizards get a nexus gate/port/TL, BUT they can only be used on luclin.  And here's the wierd  thing, if your on luclin, we can cast all our Norrathian ports without getting a message like &quot;This spell can only be used on Norrath&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes, wizards out do you in DD, but that is what a wizard does, along with people assuming wizards are there to TL them places =/.  Wizards relly aern't that great at DD until they hit the lvl60 mark.  I believe after 51, we get no nuke upgrades until 60, and at 60 we get quite a few.<br />

<br />
I am sure, the wizards, me being one, don't care if you guys could port to Nexus. But the nexus ports only work on luclin. I have to bind on luclin to port myself there, or I would have to take the Scion also. All of our ports work FROM luclin to the norrath. So the only thing I can do with the nexus port is get from Maidens to Nexus quicker than walking. I got the impression sombody thought we could port to luclin. We can't.<br />
<br />
As far as secondary healers go. I have no opinion. Both Shamans and Druids could make a case for it. Paladins, (and I play one of those also) really wanted to just be VIABLE as a back up healer. I dont think they, and most certainly I didnt, want to be number 2 or even 3. Though I looking at the numbers in the post I think the original poster mistyped something because it looks like they can dump healing WAY faster than the Shammy. (more than twice as fast by the numbers in the post.) Not more efficiently perhaps, but faster. Now I am not making a statement either way. Not playing a druid, and not playing a high level shammy at low levels we seem to be about the same for healing.<br />
<br />
I would definitely agree with going this way (healing) rather than going the other way (providing more damage) as the other casters need to be able to stake out some territory as magical damage dealers. Although changing the way damage shields and DOT's Stack would be benificial to everyone. Not that all spells should stack, but there should be families that stack with other families. This would help the other casters as well as shammies and druids. <br />
<br />
I would not put any stake in the idea of adding ports as a benifit to either wizards or druids, as the port business is about to go under with PoP. This is again going to force them, VI to take a close look how they built the Druids and Wizards. <br />

Druid are a really powerful class (maybe the most on a lot of points) ,and the fact they are not a primary &quot;raid class&quot;(but same for necros ,mage ,beastlord) is kind of balance. <br />

as a 57 druid, i know all the problems described in the letter. Playing for 2 years and seeing how the expansions have changed other classes substancially and druids minimally makes me ask why i should keep playing the class. As mentioned in the letter about druids not being able to heal in raids, same goes for pick up groups on Velious or luclin, which makes it very difficult to find a group. It`s like verant wants us to be full time soloers. I`m not sure about most others, but for me, soloing is boring and i would rather group with friends in dungeons and high lvl areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Their epic effect should remain as is- as a shaman primary- I would kill for a snare effect on my epic- especially since the epic is primarily for soloing<br />
<br />
2) It is ridiculous to use Torpor as an example of superior raid healing ability by a shaman. Torpor is useless on a raid because of the duration. <br />
  THE SINGLE GREATEST WAY TO IMPROVE THIS GAME WOULD BE TO DROP THE ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF SO MANY CLERICS ON A RAID.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal will never be and should never be replaced my shaman/druid healers- however shaman druid healers should both have a significant improvement to healing ability.<br />
<br />
Consider giving upgrades to Regeneration spells-  ie... 25 hp/tick to help compensate for AoEs- make it an Ancient spell so that only elite guilds end up getting it - but put it in the game.<br />
<br />
Also give shaman/druids probably 2 upgrades to fast healing spells- the mana inefficency of the spells is riduculous- being barely better than 2hp/ 1 mana point.  The best fast heal should heal in the neighborhood of 600-700 hp - with a quick cast time- say 3 seconds but with a SLIGHTLY delayed recast- and should do it at a mana efficiency of around 4hp/1 mana point.</div></div><hr />

I have found that as I ever increase in level, the less useful I am becomming.  This is my first character, just hit level 51 and already get passed over by nearly all the forementioned groups for the forementioned reasons.<br />
Luclin while very cool, most do not wish to go to due to the lack of the ability to port there.  I personally am one of them.  I feel like I wasted the money for luclin since I so rarely go there.  It is very inconveniant, I can go elseswhere to xp.<br />
Finally I am disappointed in a lot of the Roleplaying elements.  The really cool loot that can only be found on Tunare, why not quest for it?  Perhaps those who are evil need to kill her, but the good races, especially followers of Tunare should be able to quest of it.<br />

<br />
Even as I approach 50 (currently 46), I have very little demand for my skills by groups. In fact, I spend more of my time porting around and shouting for a group than I do grouping. I am, in all reality, a port-bitch. <br />
<br />
In nearly all situations, most other classes are chosen over me. It's ture that Druids are versitile, but that also makes us quite useless in the end game, where specialization is a must! <br />
<br />
Wizzy's = Best Nuker + Evac + Snare<br />
Shammy' s = Best Tank Debuff(slow) + Awesome Tank Buffs + Best Mana Regen<br />
Chaters = Crowd Control + Best Caster Buffs<br />
Clr = Best Healer + Awesome Tank Buffs<br />
War = Walking Damage Shield(caster's best friend)<br />
Rog = MASSIVE DMG OUTPUT<br />
Necro = Best DoTs (but the necro has some issues at the end game too.. they are in our boat)<br />
etc.. I don't know the details of all the classes, but as you can see. There is little use for a non-specialized class in the end game.. <br />
(Why do consultants get paid stoopid loot.. because they are specialists.. why can anyone be a burger flipper, because they are not specialists..)<br />
<br />
Perhaps give the Druid debuffs to compete with the Shaman.. So there is a demand for our skills.. perhaps bosting the Ro series to decrease ATK by 300 or something silly like that, anything to give us a useful specialty that groups would want..<br />
<br />
BTW-For those people who are hung up on that we can solo (mind you not better than several other classes). Soloing is quite boring, and I actually stopped playing for about 6 months because I was so bored.<br />

Also, due to the severe inefficiency of the Druid, two things are now occuring.  1) most are creating and leveling just enuff to port their other characters (44), and there are not many new or low level Druids. <br />

I recently had an experience where other classes informed the druids that our heals and nukes were of so little value on a particular mob that we should keep our hands off the mod rods and the rods should be reserved for clerics and wizards only.  Even had guild mates apologize for deleting their lower level druids. :(   I for one love my druid and will still be my main even with the inadequacies but our power is certainly lacking.<br />

I also have experienced continued decline in my desirablity in groups.   Sometimes I feel I am tolerated on raids only so everyone doesn't have to wait for the wiz to TL the entire raid party after it's over, and several have already made the point of evacing out of Luclin.  It's a real raid-stopper.   Druids have become far less than &quot;secondary.&quot;   We are a &quot;who really cares if we have a druid&quot; tertiary.   <br />
<br />
We are increasingly relegated to a soloing class, and Verant/SOE  does NOT reward solo play.   I know damn well the only way I will likely ever see any &quot;Ancient&quot; druid spells is if I can afford to pay some tank who picked up the drop because no druid was there, and he/she knows some poor druid will pay their life savings for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the fact that the druid was, when I first started, presented to me as a utility character.  When I chose it, it was because he was able to heal my partner (my girlfriend plays a paladin), and be useful in groups as well.  He was &quot;well rounded&quot;.  This has not proven the case as the game progresses.<br />
<br />
While I agree about the 10% penalty being taken off of non-cleric heals (we still don't compete in any way as a primary healer), I'm a bit different on other points.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see Nature's Touch have a shorter cast time.  I know of druids who don't ever mem it, because Chloroblast is so much faster, and they only play &quot;emergency healers&quot; usually.<br />
<br />
That's it for heals, really.  I want the utility that supposedly attracted me to a druid in the first place.<br />
<br />
As for utility.... and these are all just suggestions mind you.<br />
<br />
1) Long term targetable damage shields.  Smaller than the short term ones obviously, but something much more &quot;low mana cost&quot; so we can throw it on tanks and not worry about refreshing constantly, should we be overwhelmed in the mana department.<br />
<br />
2) More group damage shields.  IE not just 1-2 of them at high levels, but some through all level ranges.  At low levels, you run into groups that cannot manage agro as well.  This becomes less of a problem at higher levels.  As a result, the LOW levels is when the group shield would be best, yet we don't get one til what, low 50's?<br />
<br />
3) Indoor SoW at higher levels.<br />
<br />
4) Upgrades to Share Wolf Form.  Nothing on the level of Boon of the Garou, I don't really want something near that good... something just an upgrade, that gives better improvements to melee, casters, something.  40ATK and 60% SoW isn't real impressive, despite being somewhat useful.<br />
<br />
5) Extension of a Fire/Cold resist line, like Circle of Winter/Summer, completely stackable w/ basic resist buffs.<br />
<br />
6) Targetable morphs.  Maybe lion/tiger, bear (probably not, shaman and all...), etc etc... all with varying stats.  Just to make us more group friendly.<br />
<br />
7) Please, feel free to add :P<br />
<br />
Basically I want to see spells that make us more group friendly.  I don't really want my healing role solidified THAT much.  It'd be nice to be a &quot;healer in a pinch&quot; more, but I can survive not being a good one... if I have the utility spells that supposedly make my class &quot;well rounded&quot;.</div></div><hr />

im not even in the 50's yet and i can already see how im not very wanted in groups anymore.  I'm level 47,  getting a group is ridiculous in DL,  i cant keep up with heals and buffing leaves me practically OOM if i run through all my buffs.  I cant even imagine what its gonna be like after level 50.  I have never really been a soloer,  i like to be in a group, to me the game is more fun that way,  and i would like to think that i can group after 50 too.</div></div><hr />

Dude I would have been happy to Have CoH... atleast I would not have to leave the raid and run back to the raid every 5 mins when I was a druid.. because that is all we are.. Taxi's :-(<br />
<br />
At lvl 59 We can heal quickly ~350 Hps.  The lowest level Dain QUADS for that much... in 1 round of punishment we are already 3 heals behind.<br />
<br />
Try healing casters against Zlexak with a 1500 point AE... &quot;OOPS sorry guys you dies in 5 secs because I can only heal 700 Hps in about more 5 secs and the 6 of us took 9000 when 2nd AE wave hit I was OOM&quot;<br />
<br />
Even when my druid is grouped I am told to quit exping and be taxi to pick up someone more important to the group while they continue to exp because I am not NEEDED.  It will take 15 mins because they are in western wastes... OK?  Sure you say 15 mins beacause I am WORTHLESS ANYWAY?<br />
<br />
Have fun with you beastlord dude... they are new so you don't realize how much they suck... but they do.  I will love to see what is on the beastlord petition when all you people with beastlords as gimps finally say enough is enough and I vist your petition to say how over powered you are because you can Melee/nuke/DoT/Slow/Haste/have pet.... that will be fun.  Yeah all those spells are low level and don't work on raids... but I will make sure to bring it up.  Oh and your 3 mana/hp per tick regen spell at lvl 60... most people click it off for favor of a better buff we have limited slots to have buffs.  Have fun.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the proposed changes. Also a Succor Nexus spell is really needed. The intra-zone succor line is not going to cut it, really.<br />

I look around me and there are fewer and fewer higher level druids playing. This tells me that there is something very wrong with the class at higher levels. The changes proposed might do quite a bit to help matter.<br />

I love how people make assumtions about a class they dont play. We are to believe they are expert in all things?<br />
<br />
Druids do not have a pivotal role. A increase to our healing solves everything. Also it side steps the issue to every persons unfounded belief that they are the ultimate solo class.<br />
<br />
Now to address the Necro whinefest.  I am really tired of hearing of the complaints that Druids are the best soloists.  The Uber Quad kite that is viewed the ultimate ability to solo. Well I hate to let you all down. This ability, that is impressive, does not make us the most efficient soloists. I have tested this on multiple occasions at many levels with my Necro friends.  They are superior to us in mana conservation in the ability to kite.  Reverse Fear kiting owns Quad kiting in mana efficiency.  In the course of a hour they can take down about 30 percent more Mobs.  Chew on that for awhile. Kk Thx !<br />

I realize I have become more of a soloing druid at level 52 then a grouping druid because I can never get groups along with lots of other druids in the zone. I have grown bored with the class and almost tired of EQ because I can never get invited into a group because they prefer another class over mine. I also would like to suggest that the class specific armor for the other classes have spells of the latest in its line before 45, We lack this is a few of our armor pieces. Our Elder Spiritist gloves have snare as an effect instead of an Ensnare which is the latest spell of its line before 45. Our Elder Spiritist Arms have a drifting death DoT instead of the latest spell before 45 which is Winged Death.<br />

Already at 54 I can almost never find a group, unless it's a guild group or I'm the sixth member and there were simply no other classes available. Sure I can still solo, and even find some places to quad, but that can get boring really quickly. The real fun in the game is grouping, and clearly Verant has done much to encourage grouping in that it is the only way to hunt in some of the funnest areas in the game.<br />

I have played Eldriken since the beginning of the Tribunal server and find it very tough to play since the last 5 levels .. <br />
<br />
I am in a guild that raids continuously and while I can usually keep a group of casters alive, add in a tank or two and I am oom very quickly .. add in an Ae'r and well forget it .. We usualy have enough druids around for two to a group so it usually works out otherwise I try to team up with a cleric so at least I can then keep them alive as they heal the group .. <br />
<br />
Some points tho, <br />
<br />
Dots ?  Dont really need to change them imho, <br />
<br />
Epic?  its a joke, the stats are great but the effect is nothing but an ability to solo with, groups/raids dont need it and 90% of the end game mobs cant be hit .. Epic AoW yea right, oh how bout Tunare or Vindi or hell nm the big named how bout them shrooms in FG ... our epic effect was destroyed the day luclin came out so please change it to something useful preferably something usefull to the GUILD/GROUP.<br />
<br />
Heals, Definatly need an upgrade and why is our heal over time a drop off some unknown unnamed mob? its so rare that well no one really has it ... Completely useless imho..<br />
<br />
Ports, Frankly I dont wanna port around luclin and am truly enjoy the break from tells of port me here pls ... I still get enough old world tells, the wizards can have the new world, I do however agree TL's or /tpg (target port group) would be nice since i truly despise having to leave a group to port someone out, bad enough I have to leave the group to go get someone .. <br />
<br />
SoW, ummm who needs it ??? Running speed 3 which everyone and their dog has now, or horses or jboots, tboots etc .. Sure SoW is a little faster but really does it matter? nope, its another self buff only now which dont work indoors .. Would be nice to have this modified for us as well as Shamans.<br />
<br />
Potg,  Whoever said get rid of the AC must be kidding .. Ummm when your the only one in a group that can buff hp and ac well potg is your saving grace . I do agree that they need to rework its stacking/overwriteability with Aego/Symbols etc .. <br />
<br />
Well thats bout it for me however I do agree in general with everything above and hopefull Verant will indeed listen this time and change us from the joke class to the class that people actually respect and desire .. <br />

 Single target version of PoTG &amp; correcting the stacking with Aegolism so that neither one overwrites the other.<br />
<br />
 Partically agree on:<br />
 A group heal.  While I feel a group heal of 880 is a bit overpowering, something along the lines of a 300 hit point heal to all group members would be beneficial.<br />
 Epic effect.  Only change I feel needs to be made here is removing the snare portion.  Keep the dot the way it is and also fix it so that no one's epic effect overwrites another's class.<br />
 New dot.  I don't feel a new dot is necessary, however, we do get a dot that seems to end up in the back of everyone's spellbook because of it's fizzle and resist rate.  Breath of Ro is a fire based dot, not that bad of one, but seeing half my mana bar go poof because of fizzles is not efficient.  Even with Evocation maxed, and those that choose to specialize in Evocation, this dot is unused.  Perhaps remove the debuffing portion to this dot to help with the resists and fixing the fizzle issue.<br />

These changes need to happen.  At 51 I cannot keep a group going for very long on the healing.  Maybe 1/2 of what a cleric does.  And while the clerics may argue that this is how it should be, what it means is that I don't get a group and sit there while the group waits for a cleric.<br />

<br />
You also don't realize that even though druids have mana bars, I've seen a LOT (and I mean.. a LOT) of them... stand up and melee mobs with the &quot;big boys&quot; because that's all they can really do in a lot of groups... and even then it doesn't amount to much, thus, making them fairly useless again :(  <br />

One of the reasons that I stopped playing my druid and started my monk is because of the desire of other classes over druids in the endgame. Anymore, the only reason my guild brings druids to a raid is to have them cast their circles, camp, log on their other alts, and then log on their druid again to port everyone out.</div></div><hr />

Clerics need something to balance them for raids why?<br />
1 druid = enough for raid (but who needs them anyway right?)<br />
4 clerics = barely enough for raid<br />
4 druids = extreme overkill on druids for raid<br />
