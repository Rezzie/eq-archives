Helping a friend with his list,  take mobs already on someones timer and make them even harder to find!  It is funny to go check and find 5 ppl waiting for the chance they may spawn though.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure that if he's up for 2 hours, the GM monk iksar beats him up.. Really bad. Not sure if there is such a thing as a faydedar that is up for more then 2 hours, but all the same. Heavily farmed, if you find out who farms him on your server hope alot that they don't know how much they could get for the sea dragon meat, if they do, your doomed :-( <br />
I don't know about Kelorek`dar in cobalt scar, i'm sure he's the same though, farmed heavily<br />

Oh yeah, on saryrn server, i saw Bristlebanes challenge for 500k. yuck</div></div><hr />

Faydedar is on a 5 day timer.  He no longer goes to be sushi for the monk.<br />
<br />
There are actually 3 mobs that can drop sea dragon meat, Fay, Kelorek'dar (fay's twin in CS) and then Lord Koi'doken (the fish guy in nToV).<br />
<br />
But because of the yield of 5 on the Sea Dragon Steaks, at least for those that can find one, the horse meat and treant hearts are turning into the bigger roadblocks, at least on my server.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The horses in eldar forrest would be easy if there weren't so many adds...but I'm wondering if I could just get 'em off the horses in Tak...<br />
 <br />
Same with the treant heart...I haven't found the mob alla has down for dropping this in Tak...but there's a bunch of green treant-ish things...wondering if it's worth killing...or if the treants in eldar would drop 'em...</div></div><hr />

They are by the tree just north of the southernmost entrance to the giant area.  The horses in Tak have never dropped a meat as far as I know.  I have asked every person I ever see camping them.<br />
 <br />
I was able to get a treant heart off a treant in Tak, but it was like 1 out of 50+ kills.</div></div><hr />

From &quot;a grieving spirit&quot; treant or from a &quot;Treant of the Ancient Grove&quot; treant?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I cannot prove that he is on a 7 or five, as he didn't pop at either for me :-\ But, you misread alla's website when you were looking on Fay's loot drops, you looked under Water dragon meat, not sea dragon meat :-) Lord koi drops the water dragon meat, not sea dragon meat. Faydedar and Kelorek`dar are really the only 2 known mobs that drop it. :sleep: <br />
 <br />
Meant to post that yesterday, but i lost my password on the computer i was using and.. You don't care :-)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Not an error. Hit the forage button a few times and watch...yes it also drops...(which the guide says)<br />
 <br />
If you're referring to the mountain wheat, that is drop only.</div></div><hr />
