The first boss in DM west is a big'ol Tree... you used to be able to clear a path to him and kill'm pretty quickly.  As of last patch, you need to kill ALL the tree's around him or they'll join in the fight... much like a good # of bosses in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran him a few times helping friends with the first part of the Pally epic mount quest.  I was blown away you could sneak to him and didn't have to clear around him first.  I'm not surprised this changed.<br />

I am not surprised by the change in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zorcx</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main complaint was this is incrediably redicious. instead of being able to kill the tree by walking to him. you now have to killl all the walking trees in the area. and this was only put in place because of the exploiting CGFs using teleport hacks. they would teleport back and forth and just shot the tree w/o taking any damage. same w/ the King Gordock. Reset the instance and do again. that's why we had all those forors and major mana pots for such low low prices just recently. Why can't they just modify the warden or use GM's to watch for that ****. only sounds resonable. Can i get a Amen?!<br />
 <br />
no i didnt take my prozac that day. =-D</div></div><hr />
