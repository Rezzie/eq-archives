I am being asked to raid more frequently, so I was wondering if there were AAs you raiding types used all the time, but you didn't think you would when you first bought them?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dippen</div><div class="date">02-18-2007, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only things I would add are: <br />
Radiant Cure aa's (1-9) are always good. <br />
Spell Casting Subtlety, Call of the Wild, Silent Casting can also come in handy.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
All healing AA's<br />
SCS 3<br />
SoTG maxxed<br />
Resplendent cascade maxxed<br />
Spell casting reinforcement mastery<br />
exodus<br />
MGB<br />
run speed 5<br />
Maxxed mental clarity, all expansion levels<br />
planar power<br />
Innate enlightenment<br />
mnemonic retention<br />
gift of mana 3<br />
call of the wild<br />
running out of time but:<br />
the rest of the stat cap increasing AA's<br />
I personally have my direct damage AA's maxxed out, for mobs that dont necessarily need a lot of healing, but require a lot of DPS<br />
 <br />
Spells that are absolutely necessary are:<br />
Pure blood<br />
RGC<br />
A spell that isnt exactly absolutely necessary, but it is very very helpful, is moonshadow.<br />
 <br />
I did this list on memory lol, basically, anything that helps you heal, cure, have more mana, have higher stats, or live longer is what is needed for druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks everyone who has answered so far.<br />
<br />
I finished ND3 and am working on defensives a little now. I also finished reinforcement mastery last weekend, and will probably alternate quickened curing with further curing AA just to keep things interesting.<br />
<br />
Usually I'm a grouping druid, but my guild doesn't have very many so I'm asked to raid with her more frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kagonis</div><div class="date">02-26-2007, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the order I'd get them in if I was going specifically for the AA's. These are ofcourse assuming that you have the levels, AA prerequisites and expansions required.<br />
<br />
General::Innate Run Speed 3<br />
- The obvious and automatic choice for first AA. Need 6 in General to get Archetype AA's.<br />
<br />
Archetype::Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
- This is a must have. Fewer fizzles, less mana used etc.<br />
<br />
Archetype::Healing Adept 3<br />
PoP Abb::Advanced Healing Adept 3<br />
Omens::Healing Adept Mastery 3<br />
- The entire % bonus healing line.<br />
<br />
Archetype::Healing Gift 3<br />
PoP Abb::Advanced Healing Gift 3<br />
Omens::Healing Gift Mastery 3<br />
- The entire crit heal line.<br />
<br />
Omens::Mnemonic Retention 1<br />
- Obvious.. That extra spell slots is priceless.<br />
<br />
PoP Adv::Innate Enlightenment 5<br />
PoP Adv::Planar Power 5<br />
- Personal preference.. Get those stats higher.<br />
<br />
Archetype::Spell Casting Reinforcement 3<br />
Class::Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery 1<br />
- You don't want your buffs wearing off all the time ;)<br />
<br />
Class::Mass Group Buff 1<br />
- Simply a must for any buff class on raids.<br />
<br />
Gates::Spell Casting Sublety 3<br />
- Must have for healing class, you avoid tons of healing agro with this.<br />
<br />
PoP Abb::Radiant Cure 3<br />
- Must have for all higher AE encounters since it cures most things<br />
<br />
Gates::Quickened Curing 3<br />
- Also a must have to get the recast down from 3 minutes to just below 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Omens::Resplendent Cure 3<br />
Serpents::Resplendent Cascade 3<br />
- Must have for all higher AE encounters since it cures most things<br />
<br />
PoP Abb::Spirit of the Wood 3<br />
Omens::Spirit of the Grove 3<br />
- Very very usefull to counter AE's, although it's usefullness is lessened in events where DS is bad.<br />
<br />
Darkhollow::Convergence of Spirits<br />
Serpents::Gathering of Spirits 3<br />
- Instant single target 2k heal is really a lifesaver.<br />
<br />
Serpents::Spirit of the Ancient Grove 3<br />
- Very very usefull to counter AE's, although it's usefullness is lessened in events where DS is bad.<br />
<br />
Omens::Call of the Wild 1<br />
- Not used that often, still good in near wipes where all other rezzers might have died, or where you might have gotten evac/exodus off in time before wipe. Also good to place rezbox on cleric before you die yourself.<br />
<br />
Gates::Swift Journey 2<br />
- Upgrade to run speed. You don't want to be left behind all the time because everyone else will have this one.<br />
<br />
Class::Innate Camouflage 1<br />
Darkhollow::Shared Camouflage 1<br />
- Very usefull spell in solo and group settings. Not very often used in raid settings.<br />
<br />
Omens::Mystical Attuning 5<br />
- More buff slots and you'll need them.<br />
<br />
Darkhollow::Gift of Mana 3<br />
Serpents::Gift of Radiant Mana<br />
- Free spells is always nice and can save you a lot of mana in the end.<br />
<br />
Serpents::Potential of Serpent Spine 5<br />
- Higher stats<br />
<br />
Serpents::Sleight of Hand 3<br />
- Less agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then there's all the defensive AA's. Avoidance is better than Mitigation for druids IMO.<br />
Archetype::Natural Durability 3<br />
Archetype::Combat Agility 3<br />
PoP Abb::Lightning Reflexes 5<br />
Omens::Reflexive Mastery 5<br />
Darkhollow::Precognition 5<br />
Archetype::Combat Stability 3<br />
PoP Abb::Innate Defense 5<br />
Omens::Defensive Instincts 5<br />
Darkhollow::Thick Skin 5<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides all these mentioned there's ofcourse the various utility and nuke/dot crit AA's which are all nice. The mana regen AA's I left out because you really do get high regen as it is today, it really depends on the content you're raiding, and ofcourse your gear.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
3k instant heal and 1500 tick for up to 5 ticks (3 if you don't have any ext aa or item......my item is for up to lvl 67 and still get 5 ticks)<br />
 <br />
finished this over the weekend and use it every single time it is up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micahle</div><div class="date">03-03-2007, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here - We just don't use sotg line anymore on raids. I've used SOTG once since we got the convergence line. I'd rather save the recast timer for an oh **** sorta heal for the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gegen</div><div class="date">03-03-2007, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the DS just kills it's usefulness... now seperate timers and I MIGHT use sotg... and by might i mean still probably not,  cleric and shaman heals are so much better for mgb so every mob doesn't start summoning :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the reflect effect on Spirit of the Ancient Grove is just as bad as the DS on the previous levels of that line?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The description is wrong, it doesn't reflect, it's a Damage Shield.\<br />
<br />
Juniper's Question brought up a good point, I PMd this to Nodyin this morning.<br />
<br />
Good Morning,<br />
 <br />
 I had a question for you about one of the TSS Druid AAs.  I am asking you because Siccoro said you were taking Class feedback, if this does not apply to you, could you forward it to whichever dev needs to see it?<br />
 <br />
 Two Points:<br />
 <br />
In TSS Druids received an AA ability called Spirit of the Ancient Grove.  This is an upgrade to our Spirit of the Wood line from PoP.  <br />
 <br />
Spirit of Wood's AA Description is &quot;provide you and your party with exceptional regeneration abilities and a protective shield of armor and thorns&quot;.  Which both Spirit of the Wood, and its OOW upgrade Spirit of the Grove do.<br />
 <br />
 TSS's upgrade changed the description however to: &quot;reflect damage against your group's opponents, improve your group's AC and heal them over time&quot;<br />
 <br />
 However, the TSS AA actually functions just like the previous versions, Adding a DS, AC and HoT effect.  It does not reflect damage.   I am asking for either the AA to reflect damage, or the description to match what the AA actually does, since it's misleading.<br />
 <br />
 The second Point has to do with the Shaman AA Union of Spirits.  Presently, the Druid Spirit of X Lines and X of Spirits are linked.  You can use Spirit of the Ancient Grove OR Gathering of Spirits, yet not both.<br />
 <br />
 The Shaman line however, is not linked as the name suggests.  I would either like to see our lines Unlinked, or the Shaman lines Linked.  I believe (since their lines are based on ours in this case) they were intended to be linked, but never were.<br />
 <br />
 I understand if you are to busy to respond, but a reply would be most appreciated.<br />

There are some raid encounters where the DS part of this ability precludes its use. This makes it impossible to MGB on those events. I doubt anyone would miss the DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly because I don't think it's likely.  There is a better shot at getting the ability to match what the game claims it should do, then totally revise the AA.</div></div><hr />

I'll look at it. Sounds like that description is incorrect. I can't say if I'll change that line you mentioned but I can look into it. Thanks!<br />

Wow, you actually got someone at SOE to listen to something we have been trying to get noticed for how many months / years now?<br />

How large of a club / bribe did you use?</div></div><hr />
