So Mongoose (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=27984) is right out. Similarly, Ravager (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7717) is worthless to a feral druid, unless she can shard it.<br />
<br />
We do get use out of +stat enchants. Major Agility (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=27977) on a 2h mace or staff for ferals, Major Spellpower (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=27975) for boomkins.<br />
<br />
Something I didn't know was that ferals get the benefits of Superior Impact (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=20030) and the other &quot;+damage to weapon&quot; enchants. There's also Iron Counterweight (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6043) - not exactly an enchant, but it takes up the same &quot;permanent effect&quot; slot. Ferals can get the benefit of that too.<br />
<br />
When I learned about the +damage enchants and Iron Counterweight I wondered: What other permanent or temporary weapon enchants can ferals use that I didn't know about? Like Elemental Sharpening Stone (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18262) or Adamantite Weightstone (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28421) - do we get the +melee crit and the +weapon damage buff? (For that matter which would be better for which feral form?)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because we do use weapons. Claws.<br />
<br />
The &quot;real&quot; weapon we actually have equipped is considered irrelevant except for its stats. The feral weapon we're using has a base weapon speed modified by haste, and a base damage modified by attack power.<br />
<br />
That is to say, bear and cat claws both already receive a +damage bonus from strength, agility, or raw AP on a weapon. The fact that AP is calculated into +damage is not relevant for this calculation. (It is relevant when comparing a +damage enchant to a +agility enchant to see which is better.)<br />
<br />
So. Someone do an in-game experiment. Confirm or disconfirm what I read on wowhead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conventional wisdom on the druid class indicates this as well.<br />
<br />
I would be extremely surprised if this had been changed and it had somehow slipped past me.<br />
<br />
The general rule is that sharpening stones increase the damage of the weapon, not the character.  If I got +9 damage enchant on my gladiator's maul, it would affect the maul only.  Similarly, a rogue who enchants one dagger with +7 damage, will not have that extra 7 damage on their other dagger.  It affects only the dagger that was enchanted.<br />

<br />
Ferals do not benefit from either of those items.<br />

I did some more hmwk about the +damage effect. It's treated like a proc, so we don't get it if it's on the weapon, whether it's an enchant or a stone. We do get +damage effects from gear, including the +damage ring enchants.<br />
<br />
However those stones that add +crit? We do get the buff. Elemental Sharpening Stone is still the best temp weapon buff for ferals in the game.<br />
<br />
Iron Counterweight used to effect weapon speed, obviously useless for druids. Now it adds the godstat &quot;haste.&quot; The math for the effect this has on feral DPS between level 10-20 is obscene, see links.<br />

I am sorry if I have offended you somehow.  I'm afraid I'm not sure how I might have.  I'm guessing either &quot;mr&quot; has some negative cultural connotations for you i'm simply not aware of, or you're a chick getting offended that I couldn't tell you're a chick :p<br />

<br />
This is correct.  +weapon damage is actually particularly effective for feral druids because of the cat form 1.00 attack speed.<br />
<br />

<br />
I took a look at those links and it seems like this was indeed changed during the &quot;haste rating&quot; patch a few months back.  I'll have to do some tests but it sounds like both the crit stone and the haste counterweight should work.  At the very least that's what the tooltip for the counterweight implies.  The crit stone tooltip is a bit more vague.<br />

<br />
So - is there any other temp weapon enchant for ferals you'd prefer to the +crit stone? As for permanent enchants, it looks like the iron counterweight is godlike from 10-20 at least; when would you replace it, and with what? A big +agility enchant at 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes this could have some pretty serious implications for the lvl 19 twink bracket.<br />
<br />
For ferals, crit &gt; haste imho, so I would go with the crit stone.  I still need to test it to make sure it works, though.. :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean the crit stone is a temp buff, whereas the counterweight is a permanent buff. You can have them both. So what else would you use for either slot? Is there a different temp weapon buff for ferals, other than shammy ele buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">20 haste rating isn't as good as 35 agility, imho.  So I wouldn't bother with the counterweight.<br />
<br />
As for the crit stone, that would be useful - the only other contenders I'm aware of are Wizard Oil and Mana Oil.<br />

So I wouldn't bother with the counterweight. What about +25 agility? Because the +35 agility enchant is not an option for level 19 twinks. &quot;Requires level 35 item...&quot;<br />
<br />
As for levelling a new druid, you should probably slap on the counterweight. It's pretty damn cost-effective, especially as it would magnify the use you get out of +crit and +damage stats you have on your armor. If you were just levelling a regular toon, when would you replace it? Even at 60 your DPS is increased by like 3%. And I'm not comfortable with buying gold or transferring gold from one character to another to help with levelling. Hell, even if gold wasn't an option, I wouldn't want to keep burning hundreds of gold on new +35 agility enchants every time a levelling toon got a weapon upgrade. As for the crit stone, that would be useful - the only other contenders I'm aware of are Wizard Oil and Mana Oil. Which don't do much for ferals. Sweet, I learnded something new. :D<br />
<br />
Now I need to make friends with a blacksmith who can feed me hundreds of critstones on the cheap...</div></div><hr />

can't believe this change slipped under the radar, but it looks like druids can use these things now.  cheers for the heads up.. :&gt;<br />
