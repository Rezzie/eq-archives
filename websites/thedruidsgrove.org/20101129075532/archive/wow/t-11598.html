Currently I'm about 4500 / 12000 into honored.  Where is a good place to level and grind CE rep at the same time?<br />
<br />
And what else do I have to look forward to... Tons of Steamvaults runs?  I've heard that that is pretty much the only way to lvl from revered to exalted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghortje</div><div class="date">02-28-2007, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">think you made the same misstake as me starting with quests instead of turning in the unidentified plant parts and then only starting the quests. <br />
but basically it is runing steam vaults over and over again:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">02-28-2007, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure you do all the quests in evergrove as well to build up that number. There is also a quest with repeatable turnins in Steamvault that gets good rep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-28-2007, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually turned in TONS of the unidentified plant parts in Zangarmarsh while I was there questing, but couldn't turn them in past Friendly.  <br />
<br />
I just headed to this place called Ruuan's something in BE Mountains.  I was told there are a lot of CE quests there.  <br />
<br />
Wheres evergrove?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">02-28-2007, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the outpost in Ruuan's Weld. There are several quest lines that start from there that will easily get you to around 9000-10000 rep before you start the grind in Steamvault.<br />
<br />
Once you enter Ruuan's Weld the outpost is located in the southeastern part just north of the path that leads up the hill. You will know it by the pool in the center...it also has a flight path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-28-2007, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah nice.  Yeah, I grabbed that FP last night while I was flying (!!) around Blades Edge trying to track down a hunter that ganked me.  Lots of yellow ! there that I didn't pick up yet.  I plan on heading back there tonight after work and more or less doing all those quests, which should take me to 70.  If I can get 10k rep out of those, that'd put me a little way into Revered.  Then only ~20k more for Exalted :(<br />
<br />
As far as the turnins go from steamvaults, is it an item turnin, similar to the spirit shards that bosses drop in the Auchidon (sp?) quests?  And if so, how many per run drop / how much rep do each give?  I'm trying to get a rough idea of how many SV runs I'm gonna be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">03-01-2007, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant those quests will take you to 9000-10000 honored from where you are now :(.<br />
The drops are mob drops, swords or something, that you can initially turn in as a quest that drops inside. Once you initially turn it in for 500 rep you can repeat for 250 rep. The turn in is the Cenarion Outpost in Zangarmarsh.<br />
You get 25 rep per mob kill and 100 rep per boss plus the turn ins, I averaged a little over 1000rep each run. Could be more but you share the drops on the turnins with the party, unless your loot is set to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">03-01-2007, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The turnins from Steamvaults are called 'Coilfang Armaments'. I got 3 in a quick run earlier. From what I've heard you need to get a quest item drop before you can turn these in (which I got that run as well).<br />
<br />
The armamaents give 75rep each and are NOT BoP. A full run will usually get you 1k rep (give or take a few).<br />
<br />
I'm looking at like 25 Steamvault runs to get Exalted =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">03-01-2007, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda depends how quick your group wants to be... the normal group I run with has steamvaults down to clockwork, and we skip as many mobs as possible, but the runs are really reall fast, so we can do a couple in a row, but last night I ran with some folks that hadn't been there before so we cleared more, wiped some, and I ended up with more rep, but it took a lot longer haha.<br />
<br />
I think I need... 8 more runs-ish for exalted, depends on which group I go with of course.  Wish people wanted to do this instance more... everyone wants to do shattered halls and shadow lab but not steamvaults.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">03-01-2007, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically find another druid that wants to grind the faction and its hell of alot easier...specially if you are both feral.  You have the tank/healer/dps slot filled already.  If you find a tank, now one of you isnt a tank, you are dps., if you find a healer, one of you are dps, one is tank. etc.<br />
<br />
I ran my instances in one weekend with another druid, we were flying through it, you get roughly 1800ish rep per clear + armaments looted.<br />
<br />
Basically you want to kill everything...you are there for rep so there isnt a reason to skip stuff, the bog giants are harder, sometimes groups dont even kill them, but they give 25rep per kill.  Also pull the slaves solo, they give rep too, but not if they run with the master dies.<br />
<br />
Generally if you can get people that are getting up to revered for heroic keys and once you get a solid group going and able to repeat, you start flying through the clears<br />
<br />
But yea, alot of people dont &quot;need&quot; exalted here, so stop after revered, I llinked the nice healing exalted offhand to some healers and got them to come for that hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta try that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many.<br />
<br />
SV Runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">03-02-2007, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually like SV. Has sort of a WC feel to it and I had nothing short of awesome groups whilst running it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">03-03-2007, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And it's quick.  :)  If it was like, god, Shadow labs that we needed to run 293729 times... yeaaaaah....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, SV is fun.  I still can't get a (guild) group to clear every mob in there (for rep), but we hit the main groups and the bosses in about 1hr tops.  FUn instance.<br />
<br />
Shadow labs on the other hand is the DEVIL.  Ran that to get my Kara key, and not sure if I'm gonna go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im about 3500 into revered and all the sudden I cant get a SV run to save my life. So what I am doing is constantly looking for a SV group while I farm gold and herbs and knock out quests for the gold.<br />
<br />
 All the gold I make I am using to buy up Coilfang Armaments if they are at a decent price, which on azgalor seems to be 10g or less each. May seem like its a waste of gold but I dont see it that way. I did the same thing when I was working on getting the mace from Cen. Circle and it worked out well for me. Besides, at this point and time im not worried about getting an Epic flying mount. Earthwarden is my top priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got mine after... not too many runs, really, maybe 10 at most.  I was in a couple where I got a large portion of the armanents, and we cleared more trash as well, which really helped.  My last run there I went in needing like... 3k rep, went out with enough armanents to get exalted, but we cleared EVERYTHING, lol, even those slave guys that you can pull seperately.  xD  It was great, I was thankful for that group.  :3<br />
<br />
I got my +35 agi enchant to it yesterday, mucho sexy~  What's hilarious is that I'm using it for cat DPS right now as well, because with the enchant, it's better than my old cat weapon which was unenchanted (the quest reward from the nether prince quest).   Methinks I need a new DPS weapon, haha, but eh it works for now.  xD</div></div><hr />

Except when I pvp, then i slap on Staff of Beasts for the stamina. So far I havent had any luck getting the staff from botanica   :P<br />
<br />
 Im halfway through revered now and hope to be finished before our next Kara run which is wednesday. If I could only quit my job I would be done already  hehe.</div></div><hr />
