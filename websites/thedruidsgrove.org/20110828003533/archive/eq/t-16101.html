<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warrhead</div><div class="date">07-15-2007, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a returning druid level 67 who gave up after oow. I have just bought the aniversary edition which gives me all the missing expansions.<br />
<br />
The sticky at the top would be great but most of the links are broken.<br />
<br />
I have looked on all the threads here for returning druids and on the EQ forums and having spent several hours reading stuff I feel totally lost.<br />
<br />
I am going to have to do some soloing to start to get me back into the game but I don't really know what zone to go to. I have no idea who sells the ports for the post oow expansions or how to get to any of the post oow zones.<br />
<br />
My spells are probably a bit weak as I dont have too many (any) oow spells and my gear is fairly mediocre. I might simply be screwed but I am going to give myself a week or two to try and crack this.<br />
<br />
Any help on what to do first would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />

To find the port spell vendors click on Spells---&gt;Druids and scroll down the list. The links for each spell usually supply vendor info.<br />
<br />
I left EQ for WoW for 7 months and came back essentially &quot;lost&quot; like you. Took about a week to get a basic &quot;grounding&quot; enough to be able to solo and group. Within a month it was like I had never left. And at the time I had to relearn two classes, druid and enchanter. <br />
<br />
Like others will say, it's to be expected your gear sucks now, even if you were in the best raiding guild on the server back then. But gear upgrades are readily available. There are posts in these forums which will help on that score or use the equipment search features on allakhazam. l</div></div><hr />

In the title bar - change the end number to the one from the end of the 'broken' link and bob's your uncle.</div></div><hr />
