GOP spent $150,000 in donations on Palin's look<br />
<br />

WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; John McCain's presidential campaign said thousands of dollars worth of clothing purchased by the Republican Party for running mate Sarah Palin will go to a &quot;charitable purpose&quot; after the campaign.<br />
<br />
The Republican National Committee spent about $150,000 on clothing, hair styling, makeup and other &quot;campaign accessories&quot; in September for the McCain campaign after Palin, the governor of Alaska, joined the ticket.<br />
<br />
The expenses include $75,062 spent at Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis Minn., and $41,850 in St. Louis in early September. The committee also reported spending $4,100 for makeup and hair consulting. The expenses were first reported by Politico.com.<br />
<br />
and lest we forget <br />
In 2007, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards sparked Internet derision and jokes from late-night TV comics after his campaign for the party's nomination paid for two $400 haircuts by a stylist from Beverly Hills, Calif. His campaign said the bill was paid by the campaign by mistake and that Edwards would reimburse the campaign.<br />
<br />
I'd say that 400 for a haircut was a bargain comparitively.</div></div><hr />

If anything thinks McCain would be healthy enough to finish out his term your nuts. I like McCain but please...This as a VP? <br />
<br />
To quote the movie, &quot;Head of State&quot;.<br />
&quot;I called everyone. Noone wants to run with you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you call Hammer?&quot;<br />
&quot;No I didn't call Hammer.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well you didn't call everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would rather Hammer be VP.</div></div><hr />
