<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elephi</div><div class="date">09-25-2005, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted a similar thread over on the cleric board and I wanted to see if druids were noticing the same thing.<br />
<br />
basicly since one of the patches this past week gift of mana is not working on heals. It worked for me the first day I bought the skill just 2-3 days after release, but all this past week I never got a single proc. Not one. I did tons of exping and raiding in that time. (I have rank 3)<br />
<br />
so then last night I started nuking since the mission we had was so easy I had no healing to do. Thats when I started getting GoM, but only when I nuked.<br />
<br />
so today I went to the guild hall to test this. With 9797 mana I could get in 20-23 casts of pious light before going OOM. i did this seven times from FM to OOM, and in that time I got 17 abundant healing procs (lvl 5) and zero GoM procs.<br />
<br />
then I went to chain casting the cleric nuke, reproach. Again with a 9797 mana pool I got off 51 casts before going oom. In that time GoM procced seven times.<br />
<br />
<br />
so I'm interested if druids are getting GoM procs off their heals. If you are do you have abundant healing as well?</div></div><hr />

unless maybe you're casting minor healing or something :P<br />
<br />
GoM3 and i have abundant healing 3 atm, but i've NEVER seen that go off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cassea</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GoM (I'm only level 1) goes off about once a week.<br />
 <br />
This is no gift!<br />
 <br />
This is useless. I understand that at higher levels of skill it will go off more but for crying out loud this is crazy. I sure hope it's broken because I want my aa's back LOL.<br />
 <br />
I took this skill because everyone seemed to say that it was the best we got. Well our new bear at level 1 (same 3 aa points) does me 10 times as good as GoM does and people make fun of our new pet dot.<br />
 <br />
At least with the pet dot I can expect 2000ish damage every 22 mins. GoM, &quot;if&quot; I ever see it, pops up so infrequently that I gain very little from it.<br />
 <br />
And yes I know it only affects level 65+ spells of the damage/heal variety.<br />
 <br />
So please tell me something is broken or fix this thing. As it stand now the percentage has to be in the 1-2% range at level 1 skill.<br />

Most of our aa skills, no matter what it is, is less then a 5 percent chance at rank one, why should this be any differant?</div></div><hr />

My lvl 65 GoD heal kept procing it and got 9 casts of my Ancient heal in for 1 mana each. Love the spell, but yes somtimes it procs and somtimes it doesnt you gotta relize the chances for it to go off are low.  You cant expect it to proc at will nor act like a critical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elephi</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I was getting infrequent procs I wouldnt be concerned because I'd at least be seeing procs. I cannot even get it to proc a single time. In that test I did over 150 casts of a lvl 68 heal and it never went off while, but then in 51 nukes I got 7 procs.<br />
<br />
I'm telling you I have never seen it go off on one of my heals ever since the patch that nerfed the monster mission exp (which also happens to be the same day I bought abundant healing). The RNG cannot be this bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate it if someone else with both GoM and abundant healing maxed do a similar test that I did and post the number of procs for each skill.</div></div><hr />

GoM does NOT work with spells that are lower than lvl 65!<br />

Just a reminder. It has gone off quite a few times for me using Sylvan Infusion and Ancient Chlorobon</div></div><hr />

I typically MH and every time it has been going off(since patch even) I sneak in a free rain spell.  I dont have abundant healing(nor plan on getting it) but honestly that doesnt factor in at all when it comes down to your chances for GoM to go off.<br />
<br />
Last night I remember casting my ancient 3 times in a row fast because I had GoM proc twice from it and wanted to get the use out of the free heals.<br />

Its not broken.</div></div><hr />

pious light is 68, pious remedy is 66. Neither spell will proc GoM. I've casted these two spells countless times with GoM maxed and haven't gotten a single proc. I don't think its coincidence when after 4 days of no GoM on patches I start getting them on nukes.<br />
<br />
If you guys are seeing procs then maybe its an issue with the cleric spells. If I had seen just a single proc then I wouldn't even be bringing this up as an issue.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
did another 125 pious lights (got a log this time) and still no GoM procs (only abundant healing).... but in the 14 nukes I cast it went off twice. I'm still convinced something is wrong.</div></div><hr />

I think this is totally intended. Heal spells tend to be &quot;spammed&quot; a lot more than other spells, so making it proc like other spells would seem overpowering. The benefit will be too great. On the other hand, i have indeed seen it work with heals... however, it seems to be more frequent on the higher heals (ancient and chlorothrope).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have AH 5. Anyone know what I should be looking for to see it working?<br />
<br />
I get GoM a bunch. Lub that AA. I see it pretty even between Ancient: Chloro and Dawnstrike casts. Funny thing on Dawnstrike the next &quot;free&quot; cast seems to always get resisted - lol. Had it pop 7 times in a row on Vish the other nite.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elephi</div><div class="date">09-27-2005, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can still see a text message and a particle effect on the person when abundant healing fires (its the same graphic as a cleric hammer hand of the gods proc). Abundant healing has no &quot;Cast on you&quot; string in lucy, so you only see text when it procs on someone else, not on yourself.<br />
<br />
I did both tests in the guild hall for faster mana regen, but even when doing DoD instances or raiding GoD zones I still only ever got abundant healing procs.<br />
<br />
I talked to a few clerics I know who have GoM but not abundant healing and they get frequent GoM procs on their heals. I'm convinced the problem is that having both skills causes one to bug. It should be possible for both GoM and abundant healing to proc off the same cast, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is totally intended. Heal spells tend to be &quot;spammed&quot; a lot more than other spells, so making it proc like other spells would seem overpowering. The benefit will be too great. On the other hand, i have indeed seen it work with heals... however, it seems to be more frequent on the higher heals (ancient and chlorothrope).<br />
<br />
I would have no problem if it was a lower proc rate. The problem is I'm getting ZERO procs for several hundred casts of 65+ heals with GoM at max level. If I could get just ONE proc on these heals I'd drop this issue completely.<br />
<br />
you see it on you're heals. Do you have abundant healing as well? I'm using my 68 heal mostly and get squat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elephi</div><div class="date">09-27-2005, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here is my log for 124 pious lights followed by 14 reproaches.<br />
<br />
note the 12 &quot;...covered in a soft healing light&quot; messages, those are abundant healing procs. At one point I cast it on myself and abundant healing procs again, but like I said before there is no text for when it procs on yourself.<br />
<br />
at one point I do a /who, for some reason the guild tags are cut off but they show up when I click edit post. I think the &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot; characters are behind it.<br />

<br />
Sprite - *Jetfire* Any ETA on when we can expect the Gift of Magic and Abundant Healing bug fixed? <br />
Rashere - We don't have an ETA currently. The stacking problems are due to some pretty core mechanics within the spell system and are taking some time to unravel. <br />

You can read it all here.<br />

<br />
Can't they just refund the AA's for Both and let us decided what to do with them instead of having a broken AA...<br />
<br />
IE, AH is a waste.  Rather have a proc of GoM and get a real heal off again, then some bull**** HoT that lasts 5 tics for 30 hp or what ever, at this late in the game = USELESS.<br />
<br />
Give back the AA's<br />
<br />
PS.  Got GoM first then Maxed out AH, only to have GoM to never proc while healing, and only nuking.  Screw AH.<br />

I didn't tally the results, but suffice to say I went through my mana bar at least ten times.<br />
<br />
Again, I did this with GoM3 and AH2.<br />
<br />
1.  Chain casting Nature's Infusion (Level 63).<br />
     - AH Proc'd as expected (ie, every once in a while).<br />
     - GoM never proc'd, as expected (since it is pre-65).<br />
<br />
2.  Chain casting Chlorotrope (Level 68).<br />
     - GoM Proc'd as expected (ie, every once in a while).<br />
     - AH NEVER PROC'D -----&gt;  This is not as expected.<br />
<br />
It looks as if I will never get an AH proc if there is a chance for both to proc (ie, casting a direct heal of 65 or above).</div></div><hr />

The Deveolpers do not want to refund the AA, becuase it is not broken for all classes who can obtain it.<br />
<br />
The two AA lines have issues working toghter, to fix the issue, it is basically requiring a rather large rewrite of the spell focus system they added several years ago.<br />
<br />
That is the delay, it sucks, but they have been pretty upfront with us about why its not working, and why they really don't want to refund the AA line.  They also mentioned, if they DID refund the AA line, they'd be taking AH out until its fixed, and its something they seem to be loathe to do.<br />
