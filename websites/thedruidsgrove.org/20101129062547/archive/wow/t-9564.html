<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starfire</div><div class="date">11-07-2005, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saturday. =)  How to start a war on your server.<br />
<br />
1. I logged onto Gorefiend as Guarana 52 Human Mage.<br />
<br />
2.  I go to Zoram Strand, Ashenvale.  I kill one tauren, all quest NPC and gaurds.<br />
<br />
3.  I go to SplinterTree Post.  I kill all NPCs, one tauren, two trolls.<br />
<br />
4.  I log out.<br />
<br />
5.  Horde comes to Astranaar to retaliate, where they meet 10 alliance players.<br />
<br />
WAR!<br />
<br />
<br />
Later on that day, a 60 shadow priest took over astranaar.<br />
<br />
So, my friend took his guild, Crusaders of Azeroth, led by  52 Guarana and Justind a 48 human paladin, in a 20-ish man raid to Camp Taujaro, Crossroads, and they met up with another guild raiding Ogrimmar by surprise.  Guarana made it to thrall's front door before one of his commander's got him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A good day!  Except when I was killing naga on his 19 hunter Phosphoric, some douchey troll got me and Caffeine,  even though he was level 24, with a 22 bear.  But, I almost won!  If I had had a bear, or something, not a silly durotar tiger, I'd have won.  I only have claw rank 2.<br />
<br />
Then, when I went back there on Guarana, there was a 60 shaman in epics!  Needless to say he two-shotted me.<br />
<br />
Whatever.<br />
<br />
Cenarius, once again I tried to reach you but failed.  What exactly is your name spelled like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">11-07-2005, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, my name throws just about everyone because the correct spelling of &quot;cenarius&quot; which you mention was taken when i created my character, so i improvised by adding the &quot;u&quot; - cenaurius.<br />
<br />
...not to be confused with &quot;cenareus,&quot; a lvl 60 NE hunter who I call my evil twin.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm on MFKR667 on aim.  Our vent server for crusaders of azeroth is private, but I'll give you the specs if you want them.  I don't know about this weekend, cen.  My friend has to visit his moms house, because he hasn't been there in so long.  So looks like no wow. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubis IV</div><div class="date">11-10-2005, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering what was up with all of those attacks on Camp Taurajo.  I saw that in the World Defense channel and figured you Allies had probably zerged it or something.  And I was IN Orgrimmar when they attacked...I never even saw them, just saw the reports.</div></div><hr />
