The difference is the Purified Shadow Pearl gives +4 spirit as well, whereas the Royal Nightseye gives +2 mp5.<br />
<br />
I say go with the +spirit, for self-nervates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
same goes for PvE in my opinion... u wont have 5 seconds with no casts in 25-mans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But... what about nervate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm... my innervate gives me back about 75% of my mana currently. This isnt that bad i think. And with the improved manareg i have whilest casting i think i can make up for the rest.<br />
<br />
But i dont have the math in my mind for mana-gaining through innervate right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my math with me ^^<br />
<br />
According to my calculations, 1 mp5 equals 2.73 spirit.<br />
<br />
This calculation is based on a 6 minute duration fight, with the Druid being within the FSR all the time. And, of course, with the Druid having all talents in the Resto tree that are connected to mana regeneration. It combines spirit based mana regen with the mana gained through Innervate.<br />
Of course, the more you are outside the FSR, the better Spirit becomes; but as others have noted, as Resto you are rarely in the position not to cast for 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
So I would (and do) go with Royal Nightseye.</div></div><hr />

I usually give it to someone else who is going oom. I wouldnt gear myself soley for a once every 6 minute spell.<br />
<br />
I would be like warriors arguing to stack solely AP instead of crit as well for when recklesness can be popped on a boss fight because it takes them over 100% crit anyway, so more AP = bigger crits. But no, you have the rest of the fight/s to worry about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
worry about the rest of the fights?? --&gt; trash-mobs??<br />
a healer which goes OOM in trashies without mass mp5 does something wrong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MissMeli</div><div class="date">02-13-2008, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to agree, as a healer with lots of extra spirit, I am finding that I need to stack more mp5, because as mentioned, in a 25-man raid you are always inside the FSR.  <br />
<br />
However, as a mention to the innervate, I have a high spirit weapon/enchant and a high spirit offhand.  (Literally &quot;of the spirit&quot; greens) that I have macro'd to swap in with my self innervate macro(yes the button has to be hit twice), so I can recoup all of my mana in one innervate, without sacrificing the mp5 to keep me going during trash and/or giving my innervate to someone else.<br />
<br />
Also, I have seen some healer use an add-on called casterweaponswapper which will swap your weapons for a high int set, a high spirit set, a spell surge set, and a normal set.  It will swap you into the high int set when your mana gets close to full, so you have extra mana at the start of fights, then switch you back into your regular set until you get low on mana then into the high spirit set to help promote outside the FSR.  I found that the int/spirit switching was not as useful for me, except the other set the spell surge set swaps that weapon in until it procs, then swaps it back out until the internal cool down is up on spell surge, then swaps it again.  So if you have two good healing weapons one can have +healing and the other have spell surge.   However, I have yet to have two decent healer weapons at the same time to try it out.</div></div><hr />
