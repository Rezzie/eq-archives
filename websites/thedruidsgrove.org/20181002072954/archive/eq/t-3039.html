At 53 you should be able to solo them as long as you don't arog the next in line. Root DoT the first on kill it than move to his spawn point to med up than hit the next one.</div></div><hr />

I killed about 15 more and spell dropped again.  Since then I have killed about 50-60 more trying to get copies for guild but not one copy of this spell dropped.  I think I may have been very lucky that day it dropped with my first kill because I have yet to see it for sale in the bazaar.  Druids in my guild have been killing Crystalline Wurms for about a week with no luck.  Seems to have become a rare drop.  Lots of other spell drops from these wurms just not Superior Improved Cameo.<br />

The wizzie version seems to drop quite a bit compared to Imp. Camo; I have seen multiple drops of it at tents in Velks but not a single druid one.</div></div><hr />

Spent several hours hunting in the wurm caves...nothing.  Several hours at the doggies in velks....3 improved invisibility, 2 improved invis vs. undead, 1 veil of elements.  No ISC.  Finally one of my guildies got it to drop off a named in Velks.  /hug!  Spell is selling for 3-4k on my server in the bazaar.  Is one of the rarer druid spells listed.  Meanwhile, every other caster fixed duration invis is common and sells for 50pp or less.  /boggle</div></div><hr />

Took me about 6 hours (3 x 2 hours), and alot of other spells dropped. After getting into the pattern, it was easy because there is so much room to run in there.</div></div><hr />

Of the level 50 velious spells, Improved Superior Camouflage was definitely among the rarest.  I would easily get 5 copies of one of the other spells in the time it took to get the Camo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teaolyene</div><div class="date">10-07-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hunted in GD in the Wurm caves for almost an entire month (also was working with three friends on getting the wurm biles for the 5th shawl) and we never had one drop.  Lvl 50 came and went and so did 51 and 52 and still didn't have that spell.  Finally at 53 a friend of mine found one and so I got it.  My husband (also a druid) just recently was able to get his from another guild.  He is lvl 54.  I think the drop rate on this is so random that one person can walk into the caves and come out with 4 copies and another person go in there and never ever get one.  On Prexus server I NEVER see them for sale in the Bazaar.<br />
Just my 2cp.<br />
