<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read on these boards that FT doesn't work until level 51. on other boards they seem to think that it does.<br />
<br />
So, which one of these statements is true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a worn effect, and so it works, just like fungi tunics.<br />
<br />
Tested solstice earring on my twinkie necro and the benefit was there despite the rec. level on the earring.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ravensign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have tested it on lowbie to, and it worked at level 2.<br />
<br />
Anyone who says it doesn't work till level 51, is ignorant, in the classical sense of the word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SuburbanLife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well this might make someone wonder about how FT works at certain levels..<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28771&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Earring of the Solstice&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
At the bottom it has &quot;Effect Level&quot; of 44, on weapons that proc and such that is the level that the item will begin to proc so I would be led to believe that up to level 44 you gain no FT advantage from using the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">But it's not a proc, or a click.  It's simply a worn effect, and they work at all levels.  Take, for instance, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=2735&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Fungi Tunic&lt;/a&gt;, says the same thing as regards the effect, but it obviously works on lowbies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The effect level for a worn effect determines what level to pretend the wearer is when applying the effect.<br />
<br />
The effect Haste, for example, is:<br />
1:  &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Increase Attack Speed by 2% (L1) to 50% (L49)<br />
<br />
So if you wear an item with a worn effect of Haste and an effect level of 20, when calculating worn effects you are treated as if you're level 20 and so your haste is raised by 21% regardless of your actual level.  The above line is where the &quot;haste is effect level +1&quot; comes from.</div></div><hr />
