<br />
I've finally got another DD focus, and am BEYOND ready to replace my <br />
<br />
Dusty Girdle of Reformed Sand <br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  NO DROP  <br />
Slot: WAIST  <br />
AC: 7<br />
CHA: +8  AGI: +8  HP: +25  MANA: +25<br />
<br />
I have plenty of LDoN points still, so this is a cheap alternative from there.<br />
<br />
Foul-Smelling Gore Belt<br />
AC:14, Str:15, Sta:15, HP:60, Mana:45, FR:5, DR:5, CR:5, MR:5, PR:5, Wgt:0.8, type1,type2,type3 <br />
<br />
But I'd appreciate other suggestions.  I'm interested in something not too expensive, maybe a DoN thing or tradeskilled?  Level 70, woodelf, if that matters.  (Time level guild, but I'd like something I can get for now, at least.)<br />
<br />
Thanks, all, for any help you can give.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't looking to spend some time questing this is not for you, but if you were thinking about doing the BiC quest this would be a great time to start it sounds.<br />
 <br />
There is a decent druid belt from Noble's Causeway also right?  With improved healing I believe.  The PG trial belt is for sure the best of these though if you are capable of getting a group to win the trial.  Projection of Arcana, northwest part of map, is where Trial of Efficiency is started.</div></div><hr />

If you have a good mez setup, a druid + sham or pally can cover heals even (assuming everyone is qvic+ geared.)  I've also done this trial with some pretty 'gimp' people, think the best setup for that is prolly cleric + dru + war + enc + bard + rogue, assuming the warrior can tank the commander and elite at the same time.  Only problem with bringing gimps is that the 3k mana debuff makes gimp casters worthless.<br />
<br />
Helpful hint for the trial: The different mobs always spawn in paticular areas, so setup on the left side.  One un mezzable will spawn right in front of camp, and the other will be in the back left hand corner.  Also, the person who zones in last will get 'auto' agro on all the mobs, so be sure the tank zones in last.  When I tank the trial (with a warrior), i stand in front of the camp, f8 the first unmezzable as he spawns, than look for the 2nd unmezzable and target and hit cyclone as it gets to camp - the warrior will have to be very endurance conservative in this trial due to the debuff so that's prolly all you'll be able to do per round.  After that be sure the tank has both mobs right in front of em so they can toggle target between the 2 with melee on, and of course just totally switch to the second mob as the first enrages.</div></div><hr />
