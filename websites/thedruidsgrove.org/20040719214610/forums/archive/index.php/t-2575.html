<br />
Are they insane or is it actually worth that? Also, I have never really used the level 39 Remove Curse spell so..what do you use the RGC for? <br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me if I should bother with this one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">08-02-2003, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still dont have it :cool:   (not the spell, anyway)<br />
<br />
It's not terribly important unless you raid high end luclin stuff, and one or two pop things.    Regular remove curse is not really effective on those same encounters.  And you can always just use radiant cure on your group members anyway.<br />
<br />
So long as a couple people on your raid have it for when it's needed, dont worry about it.<br />

<br />
She came back tonight, and it was sold!<br />
<br />
I immediately asked for a loan =)<br />
<br />
Seriously, she was able to make me Spirit of Oak and Summon Boo-boo, so I'm a happy camper.  This researching the 51-60 spells is very sweet.<br />

I use GRC a ton, but we're doing high end luclin atm so it's in demand. If you aren't doing Luclin a lot, then I wouldn't worry about it. If you are doing Luclin, you'll get it eventually anyway.</div></div><hr />

I rarely use it now days other than some boss fights in POP. (grummus is one, Xegony, etc ...) If your guild is EP flagged just get a blackflame sphere off the frog in Fire. ( Pysomething) I don't think GRC is worth 200k imo.</div></div><hr />

I use it for various pop events before the plane of time.  Anything it works on, a bard can cure, or you can cast multiple remove curses to accomplish.<br />
<br />
I have a nearly complete spellbook.  Only missing<br />
Charm Plant (too lazy to do the quest)<br />
Ancient Starfire of Ro (we don't do VT anymore)<br />
Shield of Bracken  (have group DS already)<br />
<br />
For guilds doing (or intent on doing) SSRA/VT/Seru content, they shouldn't be selling this spell.  It's way to rare and useful for those encounters.<br />

Though we have tonnes of GRC range items, the spell is still nice to have around on certain encounters. We would happily pay 50-100k for it even today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teaamilie</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's so expensive because it's rare as hell.  The scroll only drops from a few mobs.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned a range item.....is that the Ornate Stone Medicine Totem?  If so where does it come from?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think again<br />
<br />
It 1 shot cures Arch Mage Yozz's AE and Fennin's AE in 1 cast and there are a couple of other things it cures in 1 cast in the planes (By the time you cure either of these with Remove Curse your target will be dead) The Range Item that we keep seeing (Blackflame Sphere) is as camped as Rhag 1 on our server (Guarentee you will not find either up the day after patch).<br />

<br />
If you have to ask how much it's worth then you're not in a position where you're using it constantly on raids.  Once you get there you'll be able to decide for yourself how much it's worth to you.<br />
<br />
I wouldn’t have paid 150k at any point for it but there are always people that have too much plat and nothing to spend it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylphan2</div><div class="date">08-24-2003, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A normal-sized guild that might only now be getting to NToV and is just starting to think about PoP flagging has probably never seen the Rhags, let alone killed them.  Bigger, older, faster, or earlier guilds (or even single groups of 65s) will always kill them first.  Very few boss mobs are up at any given time in Kunark, Velious, and Luclin.  For the many guilds that are shut out of those types of encounters, price is the measure of most high end spells and gear, much more relevant than where or how often it drops.  Those folks can't even dream of getting them by raiding.</div></div><hr />

This is very true. The only times my guild has gotten Rhags (and not successfully AL) is when we spent the whole day camping in Rhag 1 room on the day he was due.  On 'due day' I track Ssra and I can see the &quot;not quite ready for uber&quot; guilds in there prepping for the pop of Cursed, Creator, HP, Emp, etc.  So on the chance Rhag pops, unless we're camping it, he's history before I can say &quot;OTM!&quot;  I will throw in the disclaimer that those upper tier guilds on Aro that farm the tougher mobs are usually VERY good about letting us little'ens have Rhags, BUT only if we are there and ready to go (truly understandable).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormfront</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely love the spell, but honestly, it's bazaar value is just too high.  I'd never buy it at 150k.  Rhag1 can be 1 grouped these days with a good group (toss in some good dps, love luclin stoopid hp mobs :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lhittle</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like most of the folks said here RGC is useful on some raids of high end content. If your guild is doing that high end content they can handle the rhags in ssra. It takes some time to get  a lot of GRC's for a guild, but frankly unless you are just crawling in money its not worth it. I would be more inclined to look for where the research components drop and have a high end researcher friend do the combine for you. I really only have to use RGC on a few mobs. On those mobs it it VERY useful. I would not pay for that even if I had 150k-200k to spend..I would however see if I could get two copies worth of researchable notes and see if my combiner friend wanted a cut of the second copy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wandazula</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm finding GRC quite useful in LDON.  It's worth the 800 points at least if that's the only way you can get it.  (Though I'd try to get the research drops for it.       A lot of Words of Apparition drop)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still looking for those silly words of apparition, lord knows I've seen every other research component drop now.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remi</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh Xand, so was I!  And imagine my surprise when Words of Apparition dropped off a giant in the 3rd wave of the 10th Ring War. :p   I was able to research RGC for free as a result, and we had it (at least I did) before we started doing the Ssra nameds.  So, I got the job of spam curing the MT.  Boring, yet simple.  All the rest of our copies have dropped in Ssra.</div></div><hr />
