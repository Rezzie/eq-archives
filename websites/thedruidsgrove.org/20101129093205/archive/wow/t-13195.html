<br />
i know there is +16 for agi and hit but was thinking i could use some more dodge and would gem my new epic titanium neck with it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-03-2009, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes there is a +16 dodge gem.<br />
But i would not consider it for tanking.<br />
My advise: Go for AGI. It provides dodge, crit, armor, AP.<br />
AGI is the best thing to go as a tank.<br />
If u are a guy who wanna see the big numbers on your health-bar, then go straigt with +24 stam or the purple +8dodge/+12stam or the purple agi/stam gem.<br />
<br />
Dodge will come with gear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-03-2009, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah but remember s3R - i dont raid etc so i have less gear choices and dont get soo many options in gear......<br />
<br />
so if when you say 'dodge will come with gear' we're talking from heroics or badges then fine.....if you mean raiding then i wont get those items?<br />
<br />
What is the +16 dodge gem called ? I could not find it? nor could my friendly JC....in the end she did me a +14 dodge from a green gem !! some Bloodstone thingy....<br />
<br />
I guess my reasons for choosing dodge was that i felt i would benefit most from it. i did look at the mixture gems you mention but felt I don't need stam as much as other stats (which also ruled out the +24stam).<br />
<br />
tbh what i really need is some hit.  my old blue neck had a ton of it and the new epic one has none :(  but i know the boots from Exalted with someone....AC or Knghts ? have over 50 hit so that will help me a lot when i can get them.<br />
<br />
iirc in bear i sit at about 28-29k HP.  this i feel is 'enough' for now and for the stuff i do ?  my crit last night was about 32% but my dodge I think was under 30% - and it got me thinking i need more !<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that the run through some parts of some dungeons in normal for the Elders will give me a little taste of bosses/trash versus my gear....<br />
<br />
thanks for reply s3R.</div></div><hr />

Corrected. :dance: <br />

At level 80; 39.34798813 Dodge Rating = 1% Dodge.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically it is nearly the same conversion for gem, so you are better for agi GEMS instead of dodge rating since agi gives you dodge, crit for extra threat and AC for mitigation.<br />
<br />
So if i were you i'd go :<br />
16 agi<br />
16 +Hit<br />
8 agi - 8 +Hit<br />
<br />
Depending if you really need that much +hit</div></div><hr />

<br />
i had not reliased it was so close between dodge and agi to get +1%.<br />
<br />
believe me i need hit but i'm looking to the exatled boots from one of the factions to give me a big boost here as they have around +50 hit iirc.</div></div><hr />

Just kidding, S3rge!<br />
<br />
If Kheldar had asked for STAM that would have been my answer as well!<br />
<br />
STAM comes too with gear! :D</div></div><hr />

It will come with (PvP)-gear :elfbiggri <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But seriously:<br />
There is so much gear in heroics which lift u up to be able to MT naxx easily. And this gear is in your range.<br />
And if u have 29-30k in bearform selfbuffed, than this is enough HP for naxx. With raid-buffs u will go up to 36-37k.<br />
So focus then on AGI.<br />
AGI = dodge, armor, crit -&gt; all u need. And your DDs will love u when they can start to burn the mobs down only 2 secs after u started tanking. Crit is sooo amazing for threat-generation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol thanks s3R.<br />
<br />
:elfbiggri <br />
<br />
<br />
atm i have about 29k self buffed. cant remember AC will check tonite.<br />
<br />
i'll look more for AGI then and replace the dodge one in my new epic neck.<br />
<br />
trouble for me atm is not much of my gear has any gem sockets.</div></div><hr />
