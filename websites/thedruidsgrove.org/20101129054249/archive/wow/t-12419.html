I clicked on the druid, set it as my focus then clicked Cyclone and...nothing happened.  My UI (the default UI except for druidbar and proximo) said it was an invalid target.<br />
<br />
Now I double checked and there was a green halo at the bottom of the druid's feet - I definitely had it targeted properly, but still I got an error.  I couldn't feral charge either.<br />
<br />
My 2v2 partner saw this once with his 5v5 - no one could target one particular opposing player.  Has anyone else seen this?  It is a bug?  Hax?</div></div><hr />
