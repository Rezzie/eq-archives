<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BGrifter</div><div class="date">08-20-2004, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boo-urns on rez. It seems to have been limited enough that hopefully they won't punish us too much for getting it, but I dislike the idea of us getting rez at all. Implementation seems to be about as good as one could hope for a druid rez ability, but like with the &quot;mini-CH&quot; i'm willing to bet it'll be used as justification for future nerfage.<br />
<br />
That said, the &quot;Druids should get rez/KEI/FD/defensive disc/backstab/manaburn&quot; crowd should be pleased...<br />
<br />
Negativity aside there are a few cool ones on the list. :) The tradeskill AAs are great, the second bind ability should be a real convenience (one bind at the zone to PoFire, the other at the Tipt zoneline *grin*), and increased dmg on crit nukes is very cool.<br />
<br />
The extra spell gem and buff slots should be popular. (the latter seems to be the more powerful one, can't say i'm desperate for the extra gem, less buff swapping I guess.) The forage AA has been long requested, won't be in a rush to grab it but it certainly makes Haversacks less painful to gather components for. Improved SotW i'll take a wait and see attitude on, if they lower the refresh timer it's a winner, if it's just another AC/DS/heal increase like the 2nd and 3rd ranks... meh.<br />
<br />
Considering my biggest concern is that one of the AAs is too good, I guess I can't complain too mightily. Mix in five new levels and new spells, sounds like this could be a good expansion. Just hope they learned their lessons from PoP.</div></div><hr />

Since Wizard have TL to bind and we dont get Circle to bind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sayden</div><div class="date">08-22-2004, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference at least in my mind is that a wizard can now port a grp to wherever he wishes to put a bind point. This is not the ability to TL everyone in their grp to their own bind points, this is to the wizard's bind point. Now imagine if a grp wanted to go to Seb, Cobalt Scar, West Wastes. etc. All they need do is have the wiz put their primary bind there (or secondary, not sure how that works yet) and he can now move his entire grp wherever he wants, if he has the foresight to put a bind point there.<br />
<br />
Ability: Teleport Bind<br />
Description: When activated, this ability will teleport the wizard's entire group to the wizard's bind point. -- port group to wiz's bind point<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with Translocate abilities, this is a port spell. A very useful port spell which we, druids, don't get. I was just curious if their was any explanation.</div></div><hr />
