<br />
Do the innate strength, agility, etc help at this point? <br />
<br />
I've recently scaled back raiding but may get back into it. I solo mostly but know I will need to get into grouping to get some group progression as well. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help, and my magelo link is the VVV below.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would also look into Spirit of the White Wolf and Delay Death.<br />
<br />
Hastened Exodus isn't a bad choice either, but is more dependant on what you do outside of raids.<br />
<br />

Your magelo shows planar power is unfinished, spell casting subtlety, mastery of the past in addition to what Fenier said. Those would be far more help than putting points into wis etc. I personally like secondary recall too and use it often. It's only failing being that it can collapse like a gate or exo :eek: .<br />
 <br />
p.s. you have your root pants on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">08-13-2007, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Discordant Defience sounds good but it only seems to help cold and poison atm. My gear just not that good =( For the AA cost it doesn't seem worth it yet. <br />
<br />
I like delay death and the first time it kicked it (with 2nd life) it was great. I read the post about these, lol. <br />
<br />
White wolf is one of those AA's that seems not real useful because of the recast time. <br />
<br />
and while not too costly, the hastened exodus only seems to reduce recast from 72 min to about 52 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micahle</div><div class="date">08-13-2007, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From looking at your profile, things i would do if i were you: Finish off Mastery of the Past, finish off Spell Casting Subtlety, helps in groups (or raids), Nature's Guardian.. lil bit more dps from booboo and it's cute :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domeno</div><div class="date">08-14-2007, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell Casting Subtlety - A definite must! Especially if you raid..</div></div><hr />

 <br />
weer ya soloing at i found the cliffs in dire a good spot kiling them guards toby hooked me up at that spot killer exp ther if y need showen give me a shout in game ill show ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">09-11-2007, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I've finished most of the AA lines listed above. Mastery of the Past isn't one with much bang for the buck imho, ensnare isn't really needed anymore, lol, and I think I only found one higher level spell it would help (that I use often) if I maxed it out. <br />
<br />
So a few more questions:<br />
<br />
What is the stat cap? I have Planer power left to finish but will my stats improve any?<br />
<br />
What is the resist cap? Will the last 2 MPG group trials help much (not that I can finad anyone to help do them)? <br />
<br />
What is the hp regen cap? I have Energetic Attunement left to finish. <br />
<br />
On the Innates, will innate strength, dextarity, agility help with hp or mitigation at this point? Innate Wis help with anything since it looks like I'm capped at 450?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">09-11-2007, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Raising stat cap will help more than any of the innates as you probably already have the gear to increase your wisdom.<br />
 <br />
Resist cap helps, but not the end of the world as many resists are now getting into the -500 range and are difficult to resist even at max stats.<br />
 <br />
Innates, I would put off til you have nothing else to do but them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">09-12-2007, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Motp works great for Ancient Chloro and Skin of Reptile and Serpents Vines. I also use our 64 root alot....I also now use Moonshadow (need to finish MoTP) but these are the reasons I am doing it....well and hoping they are going to extend the line in SoF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But will planer power raise my stat cap? Last time I purchased a level of planer power my WIS didn't raise any past 450.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">09-12-2007, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">465 is the max wis you can have....so yes if you get all of it you will go up 15 points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
625.  The only way to take resists higher then 625 is with a Banner<br />
<br />
On the Innates, will innate strength, dextarity, agility help with hp or mitigation at this point? Innate Wis help with anything since it looks like I'm capped at 450?<br />
<br />
The returns on them will be so small, you are likely better off doing just about anything else first.</div></div><hr />
