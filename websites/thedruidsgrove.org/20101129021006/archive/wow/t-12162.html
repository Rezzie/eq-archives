Warriors are highly skilled soldiers with years of training. You are a large bear. Warriors use precise weapon strikes to hold the attention of enemies. You are a large bear. Warriors posses magical weapons and armor. You are a large bear. Roar.<br />

Want to know know more? Avearis was kind enough to copy over a couple old posts created by Tyral a long time ago (3 weeks long time in online market, right? Okay, maybe it's older than 3 weeks). There are two posts in total. First one details the basics of being a Bear (http://thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/showthread.php?t=12159#post147317) while the second one details the cat form (http://thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/showthread.php?t=12159#post147318) (same thread). <br />
<br />
A bit of warning for you veterans: these posts are designed for the newly feralers. You might get some value out of them (if you're a real newb) but they are targeted to our newer, younger druid brethren.</div></div><hr />

I never see the front page.  I use the direct link to http://thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/search.php?do=getnew which shows new posts only.</div></div><hr />

I'll work on recreating the links since they didn't copy over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durnel</div><div class="date">03-03-2008, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so I am 69 ATM- have most of the 70 wowikki druid guide for basic tanking items in the bank. I would like to start tanking normal instances- I have not ran any thus far. SO my question is this- mixing and matching gear- I have about 11.5k health, 16.5-17k armor, dodge is just above 20, and depending on gear defense rating is at about 356. I know the defense is low but with the 2 additional clefthoof pieces sitting in the bank that should come close to the 415 defense rating required; figured I would gem the remaining as required. I know that reputation is everything in so far as getting invited to groups and didn't want to run anything until I was well prepared. so with the stats listed above should I start tanking or wait?<br />

Nevermind-tanked all but one quest(fire lord) in SMV and had no toruble- got a guild invite following</div></div><hr />
