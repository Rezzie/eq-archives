<br />
Name:  Illusion: Scaled Wolf <br />
Level:  44 <br />
Mana:  150 <br />
Class:  Alteration <br />
Era:  Planes of Power <br />
Vendor(s):  Unknown <br />
Approx Spell Cost:  Unknown <br />
Researchable:  No <br />
Type:  Self Only Illusion  <br />
Max Duration:  1 hour 12 minutes <br />
Casting Time:  4 seconds <br />
Recast Time:  8 seconds <br />
Actual Effects: Self: Change Form -&gt; Scaled Wolf <br />
   Self: Increase ATK (30) <br />
   Self: Increase Movement Speed (45%) <br />
Description: This is an outdoors only illusion. <br />
<br />
The only Difference is our movement spell increases to 55% but everything else is the same.<br />
<br />
Now this is not a really big deal to Druids but it is just one more of our abilities that they are giving away to another class.  I truely feel bad for our Ranger Brothers that must wait until Level 49 to get Wolf Form and I find that a little distasteful.<br />
<br />
I think perhaps that we should have gotten a better Mana Regen spell at upper 40's lower 50's then our silly Tree Form that regens 2 mana per tick if they are giving our wolf/sow ability to other casters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since absolutely nobody can find the spell yet, it looks like it never got put on a vendor, so maybe they are still making changes to it at this point.<br />
<br />
As for enchanters getting it before rangers.  Its simple, rangers are a hybrid, they get to wear chain armour, they get to use more weapons and do damage in melee, etc.  Casters should always get a spell before a hybrid does IMO.</div></div><hr />

Nothing terribly new and still weaker then our version. <br />
<br />
Lame complaints in my opinion<br />

  <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Illusion: Spirit Wolf <br />
2:  Increase ATK by 15 <br />
3:  Increase Cold Resist by 10 <br />
 <br />
  <br />
Lv 39 spell. No run speed but still wolf illusion and some buffs. <br />
<br />
So they get a watered down speed buff and is self only. We have allready lost our commodity on run speed enhancements with run3, boots, and horses.<br />
<br />
imo its a moot point<br />

My point was just informational and with the recent Harmony nerf, PooP port locations etc, It is just another one of our spells/abilities (even somewhat reduced movement reduction 55% vs 45%) given out to other classes.  Just getting old seeing some of our unique spells abilites pass around freely to other classes.<br />

<br />
jboots were a pain in the @#%$ quest and i have no problem with those, they take time and effort to get.<br />
<br />
Bards have to be constantly singing their song to go faster and i have no problem with that. <br />
<br />
Then there is tboots, horses, run3, shaman instant click sow.... the line goes on and on and on so it just doesn't matter anymore on this spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really I could care less about enchanters getting this spell, sow has already been diluted with run3, horses, and sow potions.   Plus, I found it silly that their original wolf form illusion did not increase run speed.<br />
<br />
However, what does annoy me is when other classes start picking on druids and then bring up the fact that we can sow and port as one of the reasons druids are &quot;godly&quot; and need to be nerfed.   Excuse me, PoP made porting obsolete (continuing the trend from Luclin), and sow has been very diluted for awhile.   Most of our other utility buffs have all been given out too - many weapons snare, fungi tunic = regen, various items that do damage shields, etc..  Really druids are only about nuking and healing, all our utility spells are pretty much moot nowdays and our buffs become mostly self-buffs or twinking tools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deneldor2</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I dont understand is this:<br />
<br />
Enchanters can hardly complain as a class, a lot of content is almost impossible without them.<br />
<br />
Why do they need this?<br />
<br />
Answer is they don't...so why oh why does VI do it when they know one of the main complaints from druids is they share our skills out among other classes and whilst most druids wont care either way there will be some who dont like it. As a druid I couldnt care less, I'd be pretty angry if I was a ranger though.<br />
<br />
PS:<br />
This sort of has the look of a &quot;compensation&quot; spell.<br />
If I were a chanter I wouldnt be overly surprised to find other classes getting a straight out mana regen or worse still a flat out nerf to mez or charm.</div></div><hr />

Better than giving them snare :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenara Wyldhart</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find if a little distasteful because we're seeing our abililties farmed out to other classes. I once wrote a feedback about this. Necros can charm, direcharm, mez, and slow undead. We can tash, charm, and direcharm animals. Chanters can do all of that on any mob. I'm thinking it's time that druids got mez or slow animals! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir Yakk</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite honestly, I think it is aimed at helping the soloing enchanter -- the only really efficient way for an Enchanter to solo is via charming, and a self only sow will make that viable at higher levels.<br />
<br />
In a group, well, Enchanters tend not to start pulling until post-50, and usually post-50 enchanters are indoors.<br />
<br />
And yes, Druids should get mez animal &amp; mez plant -- beastlords a weaker mez animal -- and Shamans should get mez spirits -- the more mezzers, the more mezzable content, the happier Enchanters are.  The mage/necro high level mez undead/summoned are a good path to continue along -- these spells are slightly worse than the specialties class's version of the spell, and target restricted.<br />
<br />
And Druid animal slows also make sense.  Make them at or under beastlord level -- the idea is to allow the animals to be slowed, but only if you don't have a speciality slower there.</div></div><hr />

They can invest in run speed 3 and so can everyone else.  I doubt this spell is even a big upgrade in speed compaired to run speed 3.  Good for enchanters.</div></div><hr />
