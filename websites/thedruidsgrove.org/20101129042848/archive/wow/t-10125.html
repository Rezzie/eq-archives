<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the day had finally came on the azgalor server. Time to bang the gong and open the AQ gate. The word spreads forth from the horde lands that Stormheart (warrior that will do the banging) and his guild are heading to silithus to get things started.<br />
<br />
 So as expected horde and alliance both begin to mass in silithus preparing to wage the 10 hour war that begins once the gate is opened. I bet you can guess what happened next. No no not a huge gank fest, the server lags so hard and is so unplayable that yes it crashes and crashes again.<br />
<br />
 Now I know that there were ALOT of people there and even more were flying in, however this was expected was it not? Why would they design an event such as this when their server cant handle it? Its frustrating to go through all that farming and preparing, acheive the goal, only to find that you cant see what you worked for because of the lousy server.<br />
<br />
 After about and hour of frustration most of our 40 person raid group just logged for the night. I guess when i get home ill get to see if it finally happened. Only bummer is that I have probably missed out on all the rep. you can get for killing the critters that spawn when the gate opens. After all, 36000 rep points is a long way to go just to acheive neutral :P.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Funny thing is that the horde guild that was set to open the gate were being turds about it. So the alliance guild that was close to finishing recruited alot of help, alliance and horde both because alot of horde were pissed at them also, to go to Moonglade for the eranikus fight so they could finish up and bang the gong. <br />
<br />
 Well the horde guild showed up just to mess up the fight but after a short time they headed to silithus because they wanted to be the ones to open the gate. I guess word spread very fast especially considering that I know there were horde members in alliance vent to help organise the eranikus fight...heh</div></div><hr />

The hardcore true believers stayed up all night to watch and participate, but it filtered out a lot of the looky-loos.<br />
<br />
They also organized rules on the realm forum for all those that were coming including no general chat, no dueling, lowering the visual effects on each machine as much as possible, no dueling while waiting around, etc...<br />
<br />
We had some big latency still, but we avoided the crash problems and most of those who had worked for it got to see and participate.  (Our gong ringer is already friendly with the brood of Nozdormu)</div></div><hr />
