<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dari</div><div class="date">07-01-2006, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite some time ago, one of our shaman posted a great description of how to use the &quot;cycle through nearest npc&quot; feature to help in assist healing. It sounds confusing, but trust me-I've been doing this for a long time and it works wonderfully. I'm certain all our raiding druids use something like this, but for those up-and-coming raiding druids or those just wanting to learn, this was a very informative post.<br />

Assist healing:<br />
 <br />
I made a post awhile ago about how to get the most out of assist healing. There are new abilities that allow you to get even more now then when I made that post. Go grab a caffeinated beverage and a snack, this is going to take a bit but is well worth it.  <br />
 <br />
What is ASSIST HEALING? Please make sure you know the answer to this question. Assist healing is not just healing someone, and it is not just healing someone who has agro. ASSIST HEALING is healing BY TARGETTING THE MOB AND ASSISTING IT. If you target the main tank and heal him, you are not assist healing. More often than not he is getting hit by the mob, but you can not be sure.  <br />
 <br />
There are only two ways of knowing who the mob is hitting. One, your Health of Target target box that is a leader or raid ability. Two is to target the mob and type assist (or use a hotkey to do so).  <br />
 <br />
The essence of assist healing is to KEEP THE MOB TARGETTED, and watch the HoTT box. At the appropriate time, you assist the mob and this brings the mobs target into your target box. You cast your heal, and immediately switch your target back to the mob (during the cast time of your heal) using the key &quot;Toggle to previous target&quot;.  <br />
 <br />
Toggle to previous target: You need to map this command to your keyboard if you have not. To do this, hit options, then keyboard, then under the upper left box, scroll to target. You will see a bunch of commands. The last command is Toggle to previous target. Type whatever keystroke you would like to use, I use the letter &quot;Q&quot; (Dari uses altZ).  <br />
 <br />
Cycle nearest NPC: I picked &quot;E&quot; for this one (Dari uses altA). The use of this key is great for everyone. Tanks can cycle through big pulls to get the correct mob on target. Debuffers can cycle through to get all mobs debuffed. And healers need it as well. Remember that we are going to keep the mobs on target, not the tanks. In a big pull, if one mob's target is getting lots of heals, use this button to find a mob that is tearing through raiders and start assist healing.  <br />
 <br />
Cycle nearest PC: This is another command you will find under targetting options. I mapped the letter &quot;W&quot; (Dari uses altQ) to this command. This feature allows you to cycle through all the good guys in your field of view. This command works wonders during AE mobs to try to find raiders taking damage.  <br />
 <br />
Assist button hotkey: Everyone should have a hotkeyed button with /ass and nothing else on it. I place this button on my number two hotkey. As a healer, you punch this button just before you cast every heal. You have the mob targetted, you hit your /ass hotkey, then immediately cast your heal hotkey.  <br />
 <br />
Summary of commands used in assist healing: 1)Toggle to previous target, 2) Heal hotkey, 3) /ass hotkey 4) Cycle nearest NPC 5) Health of Target's Target box  <br />
 <br />
Using these features allows you to find whoever needs heals the most and to save lives. I would like to try to describe the first 10 seconds of EVERY pull from the perspective of an assist healer.  <br />
 <br />
Second 1: Pull comes to camp. Two mobs appear in the midst of the camp. You hit your (Cycle nearest NPC button) to get the first mob on your target. Your (Health of Target's target box) shows the pullers name. You know not to heal pullers so you decide to grab the second mob to see who he has on target using (Cycle to nearest NPC button). This mob shows a bard so you know that bard needs a heal or soon will. You type your (/ass hotkey) and immediately cast your (Heal hotkey). As soon as this is cast you hit your (toggle to previous target) to see if the bard is still on target of the second mob.  <br />
 <br />
Second 2, 3, and 4: Bard is no longer on target but a shaman is on target. You duck, hit your (/ass hotkey) and hit your (Heal hotkey), and immediately after you hit your (Toggle to previous target) and find that the shaman is taking some damage. You decide to allow that heal to go through. Note: Your heal started when you had the shaman targetted and will therefore land on the shaman even though you change your target. You notice that before your heal lands a warrior has taken agro. You decide that this mob is now stablized and to check on the status of the first mob. You hit your (Cycle to nearest NPC). You see in your (Health of Target's target box) that the mob is hitting a paladin and that the paladin is getting heals. You cycle back to the other mob and notice the warrior is still getting hit. Your heal lands on the shaman.  <br />
 <br />
Second 5, 6 and 7: You assist the mob and cast a heal on the warrior. Another mob comes to camp (was a 3 pull, but a caster). You target that mob before it hits the camp, and check his (HoTT box). You see it is about to rip a new one on a heads up chanter. You duck, hit your (assist key) and cast a heal on the chanter. You see the mob still moving so know its not mezzed, even though the chanter is not taking damage yet you are going to allow this heal to go through (chanters have a large rune so you wont notice initial damage). While your heal is still casting you hit your (Cycle through nearest NPCs) 3 times fast checking on what each has on target before getting back to the last mob in camp. You saw that the warrior and the paladin were holding agro, and that the chanter was still on target. You also notice that the mob does not appear to be hitting anyone. This signifies that either the chanter landed a mez or that a pally has stunned it. You are going to focus all energies on this mob now until its stabilized.  <br />
 <br />
Second 8,9 and 10: Mob's target switches to a pally, agro should be established but possibly no healers notice the pally. You hit your (/ass button) and then your (Heal hotkey). Pallies life is not going down fast so you decide to hit your (Cycle nearest NPC) 3 times. Second mob now has a wizard on target. You judge now that the mob taken by the pally is slightly more important since it is new to camp and therefore possibly not slowed. You cycle on through to get the new mob and note that the pally is both still on target and just got a heal. You hit your (Toggle to previous target) to get the mob that was about to rip open a wizard and then hit your (/ass) key. You cast your (heal hotkey), then your (Cycle nearest NPC) until the mob on the pally is on target. Pally is fine so you let your wizard saving heal land. You respond to the tells from the 3 people that thought they were about to die and let them know that you got lucky.    <br />
 <br />
Those 10 seconds are a very hectic version of advanced assist healing. But this happens over and over if you can figure out these techniques. I will give a much easier version of assist healing if this is more involved then you care to be.  <br />
 <br />
Second 1, 2, 3: Pull comes to camp. 2 mobs show up and you F8 to get one of them. You hit your (assist key) then (heal hotkey) as soon as a non puller shows up on the radar. You hit your (Toggle to previous target) to get the mob back on your target.  <br />
 <br />
Second 4-8: Your heal lands, and you note that a tank has agro on the mob. You allow your gems to reset. You hit your (assist key) then (heal hotkey), then while heal is being cast your (Toggle to previous target) to get the mob back on target.  <br />
 <br />
Second 9 through when the mob dies: You repeat the last.  <br />
 <br />
I know that everyone has their own methods for healing. Just wanted to share this method.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">07-01-2006, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the 'target nearest' NPC and 'cycle NPC' to be very iffy. In PoF, at tables I can cycle just about all npc's in the tables area. More than i would like. But in CoA, I get nothing some times. I'll be standing right next to a mob and use target nearest npc and get nothing. Possibly i'm doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Assist healing is the difference between a decent druid and a good one, great post Dari =)</div></div><hr />
