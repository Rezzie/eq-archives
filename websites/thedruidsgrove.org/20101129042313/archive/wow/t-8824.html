<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the big things about WoW was supposed to be with instances and fast spawning bosses, there was going to be little to no true &quot;camping&quot; involved.  While not completely a lie, there have definitely been some... issues... with getting various items.  Here is my &quot;hate list&quot;.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Enchantment: Icy Chill&lt;/b&gt;: This stupid enchantment drops only from the female ghosts on the frozen lake in Winterspring.  It's also like a 0.02 drop rate.  If that wasn't enough, this area appears to be a favorite of the eBay farmers because of the green drops, supposed good epic drop rate, and the constant chest spawns.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Enchantment: Crusader&lt;/b&gt;:  Yet another annoying enchantment that only drops off of one mob - but better yet, this mob is located in a central location that can be camped by one person.  Six Argent Spellbinders spawn in a single tower in the Western Plaguelands with only one or two random roamers.  Again with the 0.02 drop rate, this tower is pretty much perma-camped.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Furblogs and Frostsabers&lt;/b&gt;:  Possibly the most annoying camps are the faction camps.  Dear Lord, and I thought EQ defined &quot;grinding&quot;.  In order to get a Frostsaber, it has been estimated that you've got to do several &lt;i&gt;thousand&lt;/i&gt; faction quests - same thing for if you want to be able to buy from the Timbermaw Furblogs.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Class Armor&lt;/b&gt;:  Ok, I've known people who have &quot;farmed&quot; Scholo and Strath nearly 100 times in order to get various bits and pieces of their class armor sets.  I mean really, hasn't Blizzard learned from other MMO's that random class specific drops suck?  It's not like there's a whole lot of places to go at 60, I don't think either dungeon will become suddenly vacant if everyone completes their class armor sets.<br />
<br />
I know there are probably others out there that are just as annoying as my list, and I'm probably mentally frustrated from camping the past two nights, so I'm aggro :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I would argue that people who were forced to &quot;camp&quot; their equipment are more likely to quit after acquiring it than people who got it first or even tenth try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">05-05-2005, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Icy Chill is rather common with the abundance of mobs and people killing them. Median Price on Allas is 10g, goes for about 15-30g on my server. I payed that rather than camping it, since it's so cheap. Crusader on the other hand took me seven hours of camping, though I had to call in some guildies to help when people started trying to steal some of the spawns =-p And the tower can actually have seven spawns, the wander around a base can either be a Spellbinder or one of the melees, there is also up to two spellbinders wandering the road outside of the tower.<br />
<br />
And lastly, what does this have to do with PvP? =-p</div></div><hr />

For most of the game you're getting what you need, such as items and experience, just by following quests with a little side hunting. You seem to be left well short on faction if you do this however. I know Stormy has mentioned the furbolgs, but I know that I've gone up and down the troll temples in Hinterlands many more times than most players ever will, and my wildhammer dwarf faction is still far from friendly. The mini-quests for faction are near to worthless really, as in the time it takes to run about you can often get more faction with a few kills.<br />
<br />
More generally in terms of drops, I'd really like all collection quests fixed. They're balanced seemingly for solo players, and even then tend to need a lot of creatures killing. When you get into any group of players though the collection quests just take on ridiculous proportions for the numbers of the same creature you have to kill. I play with a hunter friend all the time and we get a grouping advantage on all quests except collections, which just become twice as repetitive as anything else we do.</div></div><hr />

One of my alts just picked up the Rod the other day off a Yeti in Alterac instead of one of the Cave Yeti's. <br />

Ditto<br />

To make matters more interesting (frustrating) for Horde, the new Flightpath in Hinterlands (you can visit it on the test server) introduces a new Horde faction (raven-something trolls).  There are at least 8 quests to do there, but they highest level seems to be about 50 - 52 with most in the 46-50 range.  Horde starts out at the bottom end of Neutral with them.<br />
<br />
Good thing for first time levelers there - bad thing for those already past 50.  For those that don't know, completing a quest after you pass the blizzard level for it yields significant diminishing returns for reputation gain.  The quests do seem good, in general, and relevant to other quests in the area.  Also there's a turtle quest for those who want to farm scales with higher level mobs (it's by far faster to kill the ones in Tanaris for scale farming however).<br />
<br />
I'm also frustrated by the Furblogs.  When they were on-level for me, it seemed the area was perma-camped by alliance gank squads.  I really didn't start killing them much until 52, and now I'm 56 and still haven't reached Neutral.  I can kill the ones in the north for better xp while farming, but xp gain isn't something I'm really after at this point.  Plenty of 50+ quests for me to do yet that I will see 60 soon enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">06-02-2005, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, as regards the furbolg - I checked with the reputation mod, and even at 60, they all gave the same amount of reputation per kill, regardless of whether you killed the level 46 ones or the level 58 ones.  I think the diminishing reputation returns are only on quests, not mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">06-03-2005, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, they only give 5 rep per kill, 25 per named kill, at any level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anka</div><div class="date">06-05-2005, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just found out that the reputation drops for the darnassus grain quest at level 58 so that's another faction disaster for me. I've tried to follow every darnassus quest since level 1 but now I'm close to 60 and having to give up on revered with only a small chunk to go.</div></div><hr />

The same with the trolls near of Aeris Peak.<br />
