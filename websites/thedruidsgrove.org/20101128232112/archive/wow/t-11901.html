<br />
Can you please give me your thoughts on my current gear, yes I know trinkets suck, just reached Curator and I have been MT while the warrior with arcane resistance acts as a bolt soak, we are still collecting Arcane resistance and getting our spacings correct but hopefully should start downing him soon, but can I ask your opinion on my gear.  Finally have the Earthwarden with +35 Agi enchant so not sure what to start working towards next, still need trinkets badly but not getting the drops atm.<br />

<br />
Your gear should be fine to tank most of Karazhan, except the few encounters where you really need a warrior...<br />
<br />
Curator in my opinion rely high on dps (for the adds) and it can get pretty heal intensive (if you have 3 healers like we did in the start)...<br />
Other than that it looks fine mate. Go have a try ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arcane resist gear is good for &quot;training wheels&quot; for the Curator, but as Brekster said... not really needed in the long run. Tell your warrior buddy not to bend over backwards for it, just buff his stamina as best he can and be sure the healers are topping him off between soaks.<br />
<br />
As to the question of your gear, it looks pretty good to me. The only suggestion I'd have offhand is to replace Uther's Strength with some sort of tanky or dps trinket. Uther's proc shield doesn't mitigate much at 70, and even less in a raid environment. It's like trying to deflect a punch with a kleenex.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">07-18-2007, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first couple times we downed him I used some  arcane resist and DPS/sta gear, not much, just like 150, was like 3 pieces of arcane resist gear, and just ran around in cat form killing the thingies like crazy.  I took quite a bit of the bolts, and it seemed to make it easier on the healers.  So I would say if your group's having trouble on him, go ahead, try having one melee DPS person with some arcane resist and sta, but only one.  Do NOT have everyone in the group wear arcane resist, it'll just slow you down in the long run.  It's just kinda a mini DPS race, once you group figures that out it usually becomes much simpler.  <br />
<br />
Your gear should be fine for MTing him.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barkley</div><div class="date">07-19-2007, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the replys<br />
<br />
I think the initial problems all boil down to DPS, we had a rouge on the adds, but Im not sure he had any arcane resistance and was the first to die in any attempt, we had a warrior with arcane resistance on the curator as OT to soak the bolts and me MT.  <br />
<br />
I think that maybe letting the warrior tank (not in arcane gear) and put me on the adds with the rouge may work better, add a little arcane to the mix if I need it but try to use dps gear in bear form.  I can always go back to the curator to build rage/agro between adds if we are quick enough.<br />
<br />
Im sure we will have it soon, just seemed like a brick wall the first few atempts we have tried, only lasting 3 minutes was kinda disapointing,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">07-19-2007, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we do him is having a warrior tanking him while a warlock who constantly keep damaging curator so he takes the soaks. .. warlock have a good amount of hp and they can drain life so the healers dont need to heal him that much. <br />
All other DPS is doing the adds, and when the last add dies goes to curator... <br />
<br />
We usually down him in 2 or 3 evos...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">07-20-2007, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your armory profile I'd say you can tank all up to Curator (probobly more). Maybe need to change trinkets, seeing your'e a alchemist I'd go and make alchmist stone ,I find it 'ok' for tanking with the extra dodge and AP comepared to some other tank trinkets.<br />
As for tactics on Curator, its all in the dps - if the dmg dealers can bring the adds down then its a easy done in 2 - 3 evocations(if they have the HP/resistance to stay alive).<br />
<br />
Question to those who've done Aran(where we are atm); <br />
We've done this several times with no luck and it seems that we cant time the drinking/sheep session without getting the elementals to come. Would it be more likely to get him if we provoke(mana drain etc) the sheeping to come before the elementals? Seem we dont have enough dps/spell stop to keep his mana above his HP. <br />
Indeed a tricky encounter, not sure if the CS/kicks etc are timed or if we lack dps.<br />
<br />
Edit, on some of our best trys we haven't had a warlock tho, seems it would ease the elemental phase</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">07-20-2007, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is even better not to get to the drinking phase altogether.<br />
<br />
Simply have your rogues/mages/shadows interrupt his spells (not arcane missile, but everything else). If that is done well he does not get into the mana regeneration phase at all.<br />
<br />
If you lack spell interrupt you could try simply not to do as much damage so that he goes below 20% Mana (aoe sheep+drinking) before he goes below 40% health (elementals). This will take more out of your healers however. I'd seriosly try to avoid him getting below 20% mana, even if you have to bring more mages/rogues/whatever.<br />

<br />
There are better cloaks out there too, there's a Netherstorm quest at Kirin'var Village for http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29777. Also almost to the Illhoof cloak as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LieutenantKettch</div><div class="date">07-20-2007, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pyroblast is pretty easy to survive assuming your raid is decently geared, and there's a priest for fort.<br />
<br />
We lack the interrupts to just power him down before he goes oom, so we just get him to 45%, then stop hitting him, let him drink, pyroblast, we recover from it, get him to 40% for the elementals, get through those, then just take him down. Only tricky part is watching the spells he casts while you kill the elementals(blizzard, flame wreath, etc)..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">07-23-2007, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just remember that on Aran, there is no tank. Have your warrior stay in DPS gear...<br />
<br />
Also make sure you tell ppl before the encounter wich class to kick / shock what..<br />
<br />
You can use mages/shammys/rogues to counter his abilites. Make sure that you only stop his frost and fire spells.. DO NOT stop his Arcane Missiles...<br />
<br />
Also, if you can stand still when the Flame hits the floor you should be fine.. Just nuke your asses off... Use trinkets at the start of the fight so that you can use them twice in the fight...<br />
<br />
Also yes, a lock is very much needed in this fight for the CC of the adds...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">07-23-2007, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ty for the replies.<br />
<br />
Done pretty much all of it, force sheep phase and nuke tactics, but still we cant time the mana(sheep) and and HP (elementals). With the lock stood us up last run it didnt make things easier, wiped on elementals and Arcane explosion *sigh*<br />
<br />
Feels as we have him now tho, feels more like a matter of time, and that we're going for the sheep tactics as interupts dont seem to work for us, now atleast. Do maim work on/interupt him ? Felt sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't :S<br />
<br />
Think that the fact that we try to create a 2nd steady raid group make us spread some people among the 2, thus make us abit under equipped all in all does have a major impact when facing Aran.</div></div><hr />
