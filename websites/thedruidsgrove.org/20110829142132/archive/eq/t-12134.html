<br />
Wanderer's Sylvan Gloves (ornate)<br />
Master's Brambleborn Gloves (DoN wood elf cultural, with Tunare augment)<br />
<br />
Not sure how your Loyalist faction is, but there's some nice stuff to be had Tier 1 wise.<br />
<br />
Rings:<br />
<br />
Mossflow Ring<br />
Soul-Imbued Ring (go to Task/BH in MPG and wait for one to rot)</div></div><hr />

<br />
for back, you might consider doing some Unrest missions for this cloak: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=83089, you might even get a 65 hp/mana/end aug while at it.<br />
<br />
In case your Loyalists faction is good, you could quest for this (drops come from NC murks): http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71152</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soloun</div><div class="date">09-21-2005, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm no expert but check out the DoN Mission merchants in lava. They offer stuff for almost every slot that will be 100 hp/mana or slightly better. With the Augs they sell you can gain alot of the more common foci most people are after and there are hp and mana augs etc. <br />
<br />
Missions required for points are single group although you can 3 box them I believe, makes it slower though. So no raids needed for any of these items and they are only slightly below basic ele gear and have multiple aug slots. <br />
<br />
The other suggestions are good ones as well, I got the drops for that cloak fairly easily, root roting in NC, faction took the longest.</div></div><hr />

Or if you're lucky enough to manage to get gimped into qvic if you know 5 people that are flagged you could probably even get muramite armor or at least the 90mana/hp augs which are always rotting, I believe they only require level 65</div></div><hr />
