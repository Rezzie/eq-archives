I have seen a few of these on other class sites and been looking for one for a Resto Druid set up.  I am currently 43 but still kinda lost on what gear i should be striving after at this point (  http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Khadgar&amp;n=Soulshifter<br />

<br />
Secondly if you do continue to level in Resto I suggest looking here http://www.wow-loot.com/v1-druid.htm and click the resto only link. <br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=17740 is for instance a very nice head.</div></div><hr />

Then just follow them around on instances.<br />
<br />
Questing as resto will take a long time and is unlikely to be better exp than doing instances with a good group.<br />
<br />
One good thing about levelling as restoration is that it allows you to become very familiar with the healing role, giving you a head start when you eventually reach level 70.<br />
<br />
With that said, levelling as feral is faster.  It just is.  But if you're set on staying resto for the duration, I say go for it and just do a bunch of instances :&gt;<br />
<br />
http://www.wow-loot.com/v1-druid.htm<br />
<br />
As Poysenivy suggested.  This is the best and most comprehensive loot list for levelling.<br />

And at lvl 60-62 switch to resto.  Caster gear is &quot;better&quot; in the outlands and you'll have more opportunity to run instances.  Finding a group to run SM 5 times will take you a month.  Might as well play with your eyes closed and just auto-attack.<br />
<br />
Most of this is due to the &quot;time&quot; you are playing in.  Had you decided to level resto a year ago it might have been viable, but today with playing time (and players) dropping off (lame duck until WotLK, summer, etc.) it just doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One could conceivably become familiar with the healing role by healing specced feral but wearing healing gear.  I healed every instance from Stockade to Sunken Temple (four-man!) this way.<br />
<br />
And the fact of the matter is that unless you actually have a group to run with each and everyday, leveling up as resto becomes even less viable because you are forced to either solo quest or spend hours of your playtime everyday LFG.<br />
<br />
That having been said, if you are absolutely hell-bent on leveling up as resto, I would suggest you also look into craftable gear in addition to the instance loot.  There is BoE JC headpiece that I believe becomes available at level 40, and a caster damage ring that isn't too bad for healing at around your level ... I believe the required level on it is level 45.</div></div><hr />

Once i got there, i sort of assumed that my spec wouldnt cut it, rather than even try healing with a feral build, i learned how to tank...<br />
I remember blasting through the mid 30's in Scarlet Monastery with a group of Paladins... i think we ended up running Cathedral prolly 6 times one night... they were laying WASTE to the joint while i said back and healed... lol...</div></div><hr />
