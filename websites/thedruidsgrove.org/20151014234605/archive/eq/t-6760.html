Now try being somebody like me that does not own GoD or LDoN (not buying 'em either) and my game is STILL negatively impacted by expansions I don't want in the first place.  LOL<br />
<br />
I do hope they fix the problems though, one of the reasons I started this new druid was to tradeskill and take advantage of the class gifts + new combine system.  Sure seems like a win-win to me, I imagine it'll all be resolved soon enough.</div></div><hr />

Well the tradeskill UI is messed up for many skills.  I know the pottery wheels were only showing like 6 recipes, and were not adding any on succesfull completion.<br />
<br />
I did not have any problems baking in my collapsible spit yesterday, perhaps it was other skills etc that were effected.<br />
<br />
You know they invited everyone over to test last night to try and do some load testing and their new code caused everyones characters to disappear :) So it may be a little bit before they get the TS UI straightened out.</div></div><hr />

What that means is we still have to make Celestial Essences, one of the most commonly used ingredients in most recipes, the old fashioned way.  :(  The new UI was a godsend for ingredients like CE that one needs 1,000's of, and it's a shame if no one but rogues can use it.<br />
<br />
But it is also broken it seems for most quest type combines, be it the coldain prayer shawl combines or PoP key combines.  Rather than an inconvenience, this screws everyone and stops an element of gameplay.</div></div><hr />

You know that if it was a bug in our favor, like if quest containers were successfully combining without the necessary components inside, there would have already been a fix.

/agree!!!  CE combines are just there for the timesink, period.<br />

I hope they fix the Mortar and Pestle / Toolbox issues.  I can't believe they would intentionally take them out.  That would just be plain crap.</div></div><hr />

On an encouraging note he said the combines would get fixed some day via a patch.            Plus, we got a lesson in life with him telling me that we should learn patience.</div></div><hr />

Better to be unable to do a combine because of a bug that because you can't play in EQ (1710 error).

I am sure that if things were working in the reverse (people being able to combine things they do not have the skill for, or using inappropriate containers), the servers would be down in a flash for a patch.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what that has to do with the broken container issues...any fix isn't going to effect server stability as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

Monday evening last week it was so worst that for 75% of my guildmate, zoning = link death and waiting 20-30 mins to relog. Communication code can take time to debug (a lot of level in the ISO can cause troubles).<br />
<br />
And I am almost ready to do the combine of the armor needed for the 8th coldain shawl. And it irk me to be unable to do this combine for now, but at last now I can play with EQ and not looking to the loging screen.<br />
<br />
The way the patch process is done isn't perfect, but it a lot easier to tempory delete a feature (or a items, a NPC, a service) that is to unbug it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendan</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wasn't that because of the casino issues?  Whether it was or not, I believe the current bug is linked to the disabling of the tradeskill UI with regard to toolboxes and mortar and pestles, and is not linked to any stability fixes.  The new UI was giving non-gnomes 250 in tinkering and non-rogues 250 in poison making when using those containers, so they decided to put a stop to it ASAP.  Some devs have posted on EQTrader's board that this will be permanent, but that they will make new containers to allow anyone to recharge tinkered stuff, make CEs, etc.  If that's the case and the quest containers are bugged because someone removed extra code when fixing those tradeskill containers, then there really should have been a fix by now.  But as I said, their priorities don't seem to be in order and they would rather put in the fix with the next update rather than take down the servers just for this issue.  But of course if the bug had been in the player's favor it wouldn't have lasted a day. /rude SOE</div></div><hr />
