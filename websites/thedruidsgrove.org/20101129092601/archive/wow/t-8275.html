There is a surgeon there that will give you a quest.  The quest is easy and a lot of fun!  I laughed myself silly doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then, to get it past that limit (225, I believe?), you must do the First Aid Quest given by the Trauma Surgeon in Hammerfall, Arathi for the Horde. And you will need to go back to him several times after that until you are able to make Heavy Runecloth Bandages, bringing you to a possible 300.<br />
<br />
One piece of advice I can give you for that quest, is don't run around to each soldier, just stand in the middle of the six soldiers and put your camera on top of your toon and heal the soldiers from that one spot. If you run around to each one, you can't triage them all in time and will fail the quest. You'll see what I'm talking about once you get the quest.<br />
<br />
I've never rolled an Alliance toon, so I don't know where the NPC is for them.</div></div><hr />
