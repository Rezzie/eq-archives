I just wanted to drop a note and let you know that there is a classic server out there that only runs from the very beginning of EQ and is capped at PoP.<br />
<br />
My guild, Temerity (http://www.temerityguild.org/forums/showthread.php?t=33205), just killed Xegony for the first time on the Al'Kabor server. If you want to see some fun screen shots from old-school EQ, then follow this link to my guild site and check it out!<br />
<br />
We're having a blast here. If you want to step back in time, check Al'Kabor out. The people are awesome and we're all having a total blast.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, feel free to post them here or on the Temerity site and I'll be glad to answer them for you.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Side note.... version one Xegony is a cake walk...... version 2 is pure meanie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ_Redleaf</div><div class="date">03-12-2010, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night after we beat the Dust Ring (finally), we decided since we'd waited this long and battled this hard that we may as well pop up to visit the old lady herself.<br />
<br />
A few folks logged off since it was getting late and the rest of us were scrambling to find a way to get a good view of her. Then, next thing I know we're talking about how to do the event and how the heals need to work etc. and, blamo! She's engaged.<br />
<br />
Get this, the event didn't trigger any of the waves it was originally supposed to. It was a straight up beat down. She never got any help at all.<br />
<br />
We now have a necro parked up there and plan to farm her like we did Seru back in thee day. Just unbelievable.<br />
<br />
Next up &#8212; PoW and the the Rathe. We are finding that the Al'Kabor code is from 2003, so it's difficult to find info on strats and drops when it's a crap shoot as to what you'll get. One loot exampl of this is Fennin Ro in PoF dropps a staff that is only supposed to drop in PoTime, we're finding all kinds of surprises as we move along. But that makes it that much more exciting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Al'Kabor is always fascinating to me, in how it's locked at PoP.  That was the time I have the most memories of in EQ, so it seems very nostalgic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EQ_Redleaf</div><div class="date">03-17-2010, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yrys, you should come check it out for yourself sometime. There is a free key a &amp; download here: EQMac (http://www.eqmac.com/)<br />
<br />
In the past year we've had a substantial influx of new players on Al'Kabor that is the result of some posts concerning our server on the SOE forums and a popular thread on the Fires of Heaven site (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/mmorpg-general-discussion/38234-eqmac-those-starting-up-mac-server.html/) too.<br />
<br />
More recently, I've noticed a lot of old toons that left when WoW hit that are coming back to Al'Kabor for a few reasons:<br />
<br />
1). We have an older player base, so there isn't a lot of immaturity and stupid stuff going on.<br />
<br />
2). There is no mudflation or Show EQ. There are no in-game maps, shared bank or targeting rings. This is truly old-school EQ.<br />
<br />
3). The realization that what made EQ great is the people you play with day-to-day. We've got those in ample supply.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying other games aren't awesome, they definitely are. But I am saying that if you want an authentic, throwback EQ server, here it is, primed and ready to explore.<br />
<br />
All are welcome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">03-19-2010, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, alot of it would be fun, probably as close to a classic server as Sony will ever release.  Fun playing with unlinked and un nerfed spells like breath of karana and fury of air.  Druids were fairly balanced between dps and healing, still some gaps in the 34-58 range that needed some closing.  Plus, you get to do alot of the utility functions of a druid, like pulling, buffs like regens and thorns being pretty viable until Pop.  Snares and evacs, until pop.  Cabbage and glades with good stackability,  as well as symbols and skin like nature as compared to hero, screw you temperance.<br />

if only it didn't require that pesky mac or hackintosh software.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seems quite a few of the Wizards, Chanters, Necros and Bards are bound in that zone so they can conveniently raise havoc whenever they want.<br />
<br />
And that's the great think about Al'Kabor. The camps are almost always open. (almost)</div></div><hr />
