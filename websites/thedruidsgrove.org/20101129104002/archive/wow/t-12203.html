<br />
The resto tree is chalk full of awesome talents, almost to the point where you want to put a full 61 points into it.<br />
<br />
If you like the hot casting and topping people off, going ToL and taking all the talents to bolster that is the way you should go.<br />
<br />
If you like chain casting be heals, then a dreamstate/healing touch build is better.  <br />
<br />
Both specs are totally viable healers, just each is for a preferred play style.</div></div><hr />

I did, and I know many others have. After a while, they figure out what talents they don't need and drop them for something in another tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that there is no best healing spec, just whatever suits you best. If you do like to be able to do damage and are not too keen on feral then this is the way to go. Also helps now they added the spell damage onto all healing gear, it's not perfect for grinding/farming whatever but it will save you the respec!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sey</div><div class="date">12-04-2007, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druid healers focused on raiding will go 0/0/61 or 1/0/60.  When speccing your druid healer for raiding, keep in mind:<br />
- You'll drop tree for Decurse and Healing Touch **<br />
- Natural Perfection is a PVP talent - skip it for raiding<br />
<br />
Druid healers focused on PVP will often go 8/11/42.<br />
- Natural Perfection in the resto tree<br />
- Demoralizing Roar, Thick Hide, Feral Charge in the Feral tree<br />
- Nature's Grasp / Control of Nature in the balance tree<br />
<br />
<br />
** Edit: what I meant to say is, you'll find yourself shifting in and out of tree form to cast decurse and healing touch.</div></div><hr />
