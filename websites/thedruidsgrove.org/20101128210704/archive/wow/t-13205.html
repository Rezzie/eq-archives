<br />
Luckily throughout my raiding life, I've collected some junk no one wanted. Im hit and expertise capped, and sitting at about 6500 AP unbuffed.<br />
<br />
What add ons would you reccomend? Right now I'm just using DOTTimer to keep track of mangle and rake etc. However, I was wondering if there was a similar app that would also keep track of how much time is left on things like Savage Roar.<br />
<br />
Any info on any useful apps would be helpful!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure that it is possible to be both hit and expertise capped at this point in the game, but its not terribly difficult to do one or the other.  (always go Hit &gt; Exper)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-19-2009, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the expertise-dodge-cap is really easy.<br />
but the 15% parry-cap would be a big loss in other stats.<br />
And as Solar pointed out: HIT &gt; EXPERTISE!<br />
<br />
Also expertise is a stat for tanks. (im at around 10-11%)<br />
As cat u want to be behind the mob and they cant parry if your behind them. So the dodge-cap is enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
given i dont raid i'll not be bothering about getting it above 200 but just as close to 200 as I can without losing other stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">03-10-2009, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hit cap is actually pretty easy to get I've found.  The Sphere of Red Dragon's Blood from heroic nexus helps immensely.  In kitty gear at the moment I'm at about 316 hit actually which is over.  Once I get new pants I'll be able to itemize a bit more and drop that down.  <br />
<br />
I'm usually a bear but when I ran heroics the other day I was pushing ~3,000-3,500 DPS in kitty form.  I have yet to let my guild let me try to DPS in 25 Man Naxx so I can't get Patchwerk numbers or anything yet. <br />
<br />
Expertise, while not a wasted stat is really only for bears.  Mobs can't parry from behind and you should always be DPSing from the back.</div></div><hr />
