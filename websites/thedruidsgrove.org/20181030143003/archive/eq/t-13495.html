<br />
Run to EW zone line and wait with the squads of giants while they prepare to charge.<br />
<br />
Stand Dain toe to toe with the named of each wave with attack on, to get instant agro each time they become active.<br />
<br />
Have a cleric standing nearby to chain CH once the fight begins.<br />
<br />
By attacking named, Dain will hold agro on EVERY MOB at once while the coldain attack safely.  <br />
<br />
A single cleric chain casting Ch on dain will keep him alive safely through the first through third waves.  On the last wave, you will have to have some fancy footwork to stretch the CH's out till your coldains have killed enough of hte giants.  Or else, bring a 2nd cleric to rotate the CH's.<br />
<br />
Also, as long as dain is in melee range of every giant, and the coldains are beating them up as well, your cleric will not pull agro from CH's.  Just start Ch as soon as you see the yellow emote &amp; dain start to swing.  <br />
<br />
Using this method, i was able to 3 box the task without losing any coldain troops. <br />
<br />
On the coldain #1  MM, use lazy agro range to split named from adds and that mission too will become 3 boxable.</div></div><hr />

You can only have one unit at any position at any time. So how do you get the coldains to attack? Pull back to spires?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beatslayer</div><div class="date">03-11-2006, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As soon as you arrive in GD, tell the General &quot;Unit A forward&quot; and he'll repeat your command, then tell him &quot;unit B forward&quot; &quot;unit C forward' and &quot;unit D forward&quot;. <br />
<br />
This makes all coldain troops sit on the spawn spot of where giants pop, near EW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gereg</div><div class="date">03-12-2006, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, we did it.  But, we had to pull first wave of giants to the spires.  Then someone had to go back and give commands to the general after each wave. The coldain were too slow to get there for the first wave, but they made it to the spires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beatslayer</div><div class="date">03-12-2006, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hail the general and he'll say some junk with [orders] in brackets.  when you say orders he'll say somethin like [advance troops]  [retreat] and [attack].  When you say attack he says [unit a forward] [unit b forward] [unit c forward] and [unit d forward].  When you say unit a forward you will see him reply in an odd text &quot;unit a forward&quot;. once you see this wait a sec then proceed to tell him &quot;unit b forward&quot; and repeat thru unit c and d.  From the general, you should then see all coldain troops start to march to EW zoneline.<br />
<br />
Even if you run straight to the general as soon as you enter the zone and tell him to forward all units to attack, they'll still only get to the great spire before they cross paths with the giants, here's where first fight will likely take place.  When the wave is over, BE SURE TO TELL the general the 4 lines of text to advance units a - d forward again, and do this each time a wave dies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;use lazy agro range&quot;<br />
<br />
Could you possibly expand upon it please ?<br />
<br />
I just kite all the mobs myself, and the group picks them off, although with the Snarers at boss 2 it can be a pain...</div></div><hr />
