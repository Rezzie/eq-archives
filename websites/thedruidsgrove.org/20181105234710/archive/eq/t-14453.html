There is a new exploration aug charm that begins in Cresent Reach.<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan is on the 2nd level in CR in a little hut.<br />
<br />
Here is some text from the quest:<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan says 'Vasha, Wyre.  I am the leader of the [Wanderlust] Guild. See, Wanderlust is my middle name, given to me by my father, Venesh the Greenblood. I was eager to start the Awakening, my life's journey, and so took to exploring even though I was just awoken from what I call the human-dream. That is the life I don't remember, but I imagine I was a plainswalker then.'<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan says 'I started this guild so that those like me who yearn to seek knowledge of the world are among those of like kind. We travel to unknown places and learn about them. We collect and share all our information and I have a journeystone for members that continue to support the guild. It will even grow more powerful the more you aid us. Would you like to [join]?'<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan says 'Very good! To be a member, all that is required is that you investigate and explore. I will almost always have places in the world I would like you to see. For now, I would like you to explore some areas of Blightfire Moors. Will you [do this] for me?'<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan says 'Now you must go farther and introduce yourself to some very important folk. You will find the Crossroads as you follow the road through the Moors from the city.  Here the road will split. The south road leads to a bustling farm and the north road leads you to the dangerous lands of the Goru`kar Mesa. When you get to the crossroads, talk to Wanderer Gimlek. He is also in our guild and will give you some exploration quests on my behalf.  We have much work to do.'<br />
<br />
Wanderer Gimlek says 'Who goes there?! Who sent you? Are you a [friend] or foe?'<br />
<br />
Wanderer Gimlek says 'Ah, another recruit of the Wanderlust Guild. Very good. It's been so dangerous out here I'm starting to lose my wits. I'm not very trusting anymore. It's a hard life I have chosen. Cold nights and blistering hot days . . . not to mention the strange noises and creatures beyond the city.  Are you ready for more [adventure]?'<br />
<br />
Wanderer Gimlek says 'Excellent! We have much work to do. You must investigate the gnoll mine to the south, a strange portal of wizardry, the frightful area where the Curse of the Gods was laid down upon Norrath and some other [spots] too!'<br />
<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan says 'You have done pretty well so far Wyre. I am pleased with how you are progressing. If you would like to continue, please seek out Pilgrim Fiskar, he is located in a small camp hidden in the reeds in the southeast area of the Blightfire Moors.'<br />
<br />
Pilgrim Fiskar says 'Get down! Do you want them to see you? Look at them all! I bet Master Regan sent you, didn't he? Crazy ole sport, he is. He sent me out here with nothing but my wits, a scroll, and a puppet.  I'm still trying to figure out what the puppet is for. I'm thinking it was a joke. Anyway, let's get to [business]!'<br />
<br />
<br />
Pilgrim Fiskar says 'Yes, indeed. Be careful and diligent -- an obvious statement, huh? We really do need you to go and greet Selay. She is a great dragon who is here from the dragon's Nest, though I'm not sure why.  The drakkin greeting will be familiar to her as its derived from the Elder Dragon language. While you're at it, investigate the ogre ruins to the north, the cursed woods to the northeast and locate the entrance to Stone Hive. When you're done, get your information back to Regan as soon as possible. Are you [willing]?'<br />
<br />
<br />
Pilgrim Fiskar says 'Yessiree. Much to do and little time. I need you to wander this area. Obviously, I'm stuck here...so to speak! Ha! Get that fanny of yours moving. Didn't they warn you that your explorations won't be a walk in the park? Get a closer look at the farm fields, then go and locate the entrance to Stone Hive. Head northeast past where the ghostpack hunts, and locate the grove where Selay is near the hillside. As crazy as it sounds, I need you to go and utter the word 'vasha' -- the drakkin way of greeting, to the [dragon].'<br />
<br />
<br />
Pilgrim Fiskar says 'Remember to see Regan when you are finished.'<br />
<br />
Master Vanguard Regan says 'You have learned much about these lands, yes? There is a lot to see out there. I only wish I had more time to go out there myself. You must go even farther afield now. There is a great mesa named after a great giant who lived as a hermit. Legends mention something about his magic turning some beautiful elves into the harpies!  It is called Goru`kar mesa. Go there and seek out Pioneer Vulu.'<br />
<br />
Pioneer Vulu says 'Vasha, adventurous one. You are certainly brave to make your way into this region. It certainly is dangerous here. Regan himself would begin to find the lands challenging here.  There are several [beasts] here I've never come upon in my earlier explorations.'<br />
<br />
Pioneer Vulu says 'Indeed. Not all are friendly, but some are.  Some [satyrs] seem to welcome us while others want to see our heads on sticks.  There are also some very bothersome nymphs and griffons.  There are many areas to explore here, both the satyr encampments, the approach to the mesa with the great Windwillow, the Serpent River at Hissing Bend bridge, the hunting grounds, nymph isle, and the lake the nymphs guard called Tunare's Tear.'<br />
<br />
Pioneer Vulu says 'Interesting creatures, legs like deer with faces like humans, in fact one [stumbled] into camp just the other day.'<br />
<br />
Pioneer Vulu says 'Yes, quite literally, he was overcome by spirits but not of the undead variety, if you get my meaning? He stumbled about the camp rambling a story about how his brother turned against him. There are many sorts of creatures to meet and areas to explore in Goru`kar Mesa. I would like you to explore the satyr camps, an area of water nymphs called potameids, the approach to the mesa where the great Windwillow stands, the Serpent River at Hissing Bend bridge, the hunting grounds, nymph isle, and the lake the nymphs guard called Tunare's Tear. Will you [investigate]?'<br />
<br />
Pioneer Vulu says 'Excellent! Return to me when you've completed this task. There is much to be done.'<br />
<br />
 That's just some of the conversation text.. I don't know why my log didn't pick all of it up.. also some of the messages are in yellow &quot;system&quot; text, so be on guard ;)<br />
<br />
Currently you can achive 5 updates.. really it comes out to be 3<br />
<br />
Blightfire Moor<br />
Goru`kar  Mesa<br />
Sunderork Springs<br />
<br />
You can get the quest for Vergalid Mines, but no one has deciphered how to gain entrance to the throne room.<br />
<br />
The pathway is behind the crypt area, there are 3 statues with a beam of light comming from them. the north statue (blocking the path) gives a message about being to heavy to move.  There is a 4th light beam comming from the ceiling.  There are 4 crystals that move around the center and have an aura that does 65 dmg and breaks invis.  each statue has 2 stone warden guards, and there are  8 or so Drakkin stationed inside the room aswell.<br />

 <br />
 Word of advice tho, don't drop invis in that tent to try to talk to that guy ... I *think* those 3 mobs laying on the ground con'd light blue to 75 - but when I dropped invis to attempt to talk to the guy in the tent who iirc has (Quests) next to his name, at least on the map he did ... those 3 mobs got up and whooped me good and something from the outside aggro'd also - was a white con.  A Green Legion ravager max hit on me was 1729, and A Skullcrush conscript hit me for max 2119 - I was dead in literally 3 seconds! So, yeah again - Don't try to talk to him!</div></div><hr />

From the elevator, hang a left and follow the corridor a ways till you get to the room.  I don't have his exact location handy, but I think it was posted in the SOE forums.  My advice would be to circle the edge of the room, paying special attention to look carefully around pillars.  If you don't find him after one full circle, try reversing directions - took me forever to find him as I wandered all over the zone, and then suddenly he was immediately visible when I came into the room from a different direction.<br />

Yeah after the Vald explore, you have to go back to Regan who gives you yet another explore ( basically running from CR back to Wyl`ard.  After you complete that, he will give you the Frostcrypt task.<br />
<br />
I am currently on the Frostcrypt task, but unable to figure out how to get to the Shade King's chambers.  (I'm fairly sure it's behind the statue).</div></div><hr />

The task from Selay is an unrelated quest.<br />

You should recieve a task update from just comming into close range of the dragon not by Hailing it.  If you don't get the update, try running around the spot till you get it.</div></div><hr />

However, when I try to get the Frostcrypt exploration task from Wyl`ard, he tells me he does not have anything for someone with my abilities. I am a level 72 druid. Perhaps I will need to level a bit more before he sends me to Frostcrypt... or perhaps there's something else to it.<br />
 <br />
Was anyone able to get the Frostcrypt task from Cartographer Wyl`ard? <br />
I cannot get this part of the task either.  I have completed everything else, including the task after the Valdeholm task that asks me to find Wyl'ard and has update points along the way there.  I was requesting it as a 70 shrouded ROG, but I am a 71 IKS MNK.  Anyone have any advice on what might be wrong?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Went back to double-check.  Wyl'ard won't give me task in natural form either.</div></div><hr />

From beginning to end (as far as I could go, anyway) this took me about 7 hours. Keep in mind, I had to find most of the trigger spots on my own (as not all are mapped), and was also creating this as I went. <br />
For someone following this walkthrough, you should be able to do it in 4 hours or less http://syndicatus.guildportal.com/Faces/face_happy.gif<br />

This is not the Door that is being refferd to. The door is the statue in the very entrance of Frostcrypt. Below it is a tunnel which leads to the Shade Kings chambers. However, it is broken atm as it will not move as has been posted. :frown: At least this is what im lead to beleive as the maze area and beyond is said to be a raid area, and i had a guildie try going through the maze in rogue shroud and got killed.</div></div><hr />

oops, i gave incorrect instructions... <br />
to convert from loc to the map file, instead of x,y,z, you have to put -y, -x, z <br />
so... reverse the first 2 numbers, and reverse the sign of each <br />

okay. so this should be in proper format (if something is wrong, blame breez). <br />

I'm volunteering my neck on the chopping block this morning, just to get the information out there.<br />
<br />
We looked into the quest and through a series of completely non-comedic errors, the wrong step in the quest was removed during the fix and the error wasn't caught before it went live.<br />
<br />
It really burns me to have to tell you that because this fix requires servers to come down, so it's going to have to wait until the next patch.<br />
<br />
A thousand apologies, and then some,<br />

You'll see a stone in the middle the room.  Run up to the center of the platform area in that room for the update.<br />
<br />
Then it was off to the left size of the zone, then the right... the last update I went back to the first update area and used levi to get down near the gate at the bottom of the lava pool.  Then it asks you to return to the quest giver for nothing... I wish it would of bumped it to 100 hps or something. :)</div></div><hr />

****As of next patch the stats at this level are going down. They are current the stats you are supposed to get at the end of the quest. Next patch you will have to do Ashen gate for this level of stats**** <br />
 <br />
STEP 78: Locate the Artifact (Scale of Veeshan) <br />
Zone: Ashengate <br />
Loc: 1360, 60 (end of the walkway that overlooks the lava in front of the scale)<br />
 <br />
STEP 79: Top of the Shattered Halls <br />
Zone: Ashengate <br />
Loc: 380, 400 (west/left from the zone in, 2nd circular room up the ramp is where it triggered, though I had fallen through the floor above trying to skirt around it when it triggered) <br />
 <br />
STEP 80: Travel Across the Stone Span <br />
Zone: Ashengate <br />
Loc: 792, 681 (further into the west, past the 3rd circular room is a bridge surrouned by dragon heads, one which has lava flowing from its eyes. If you go to the final room, the torch thing on the north wall is a click-zone out to Direwind.) <br />
 <br />
STEP 81: Explore the Nesting Grounds <br />
Zone: Ashengate <br />
Loc: 1550, -860 (upper NE area, there are some windy paths just before a big room with a &quot;tunnel&quot; that leads to the lava pit below the Scale of Veeshan. The &quot;middle&quot; of the windy path is the loc. You'll know you're in the right spot when you start to see eggs. I DA'd and ran through this area to the big room before the &quot;tunnel&quot; to the lava area under the Scale&quot; By far the hardest part.) <br />
 <br />
STEP 82: Find the place where the lava pools <br />
Zone: Ashengate <br />
Loc: 1850, -330 (near the gate down by the lava under the Scale of Veeshan... gates were locked for me so had to go back up and around like how I got to the Scale in the first place).</div></div><hr />

No, ITU potions work fine. I've completed all steps through the end of Frostcrypt without any need for a shroud.</div></div><hr />

Was thinking of trying this using Second Life, Direwood Guard, etc... and seeing how far I could get...  What would be really helpful is if someone has a map of Ashengate annotated for the quest so we can do a blind run with visual assistance...</div></div><hr />
