This might be worth stickying.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't consider the Black Orb of the Scrykin &quot;groupable&quot; as it requires Daosheen, Porthio, and Zomm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitano</div><div class="date">12-22-2007, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good call .. gonna do more as i get bored at work</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Right Eye of Ateleka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=66609) is the one Tanom listed. Rockstorm drops, named Dervish in Atiiki. His phers are scorpions, bugs, and dervishes around Cragbeast pit. Some bugs south can be, but not many that I have seen. Only mobs that can be a dervish or scorpion can be Rockstorm. Non-summoner, easily soloed.<br />
Muckdiver's Eye (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=66147) 60 Mana/Hp/End, 15 Fire Resist, 15 Attack, 5 Damage shield. <br />
Believe it or not, drops from Muckdiver in Thallasius. Any mob outside tunnels can be his ph. He summons and is annoying. Hits hard and fast, easily groupable, not easily soloed.<br />
 <br />
Also for you odd hp aug druids<br />
Left Eye of Ateleka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=67637) 90 HP, 20 Fire Resist, 10 Attack <br />
Dropped from Phobolyten in the southwest pyramid. He spawns from the jellos on the bottom floor. Hard to get to because of the bug traps, but doable. I soloed him for the ring to have some friends come and loot.<br />
Polished Fire Coral (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=56801) 90 HP/End, 10 Sta, 15 Disease and Poison Resist, 3 Regen. <br />
Drops from Rockcrusher (named regrua) in Thallasius. Any mob outside the tunnels can be his ph, easily soloed, does not summon.<br />
 <br />
All these augs are their rare drops and can be a pain to get to drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Few notes..<br />
<br />
Anything Slot 8 only is raid.  While you can group several raid mobs now (such as Anguish Minis) it takes you a raid to get there in the first place.<br />
<br />
That said:<br />
<br />
All the following are groupable, some are 7 / 8<br />
<br />
Eye of the Lightning Lord - 60 / 60 - MPG Trial of Destruction<br />
Heartstone of Memory 70 Mana - Riftseekers<br />
Gem of the Scrykin Magus - AC 10 60 / 60 / 60 - Skylance 3 Named (rare)<br />
Festerclaw's Molar - 75 / 75 / 75 - Festerclaw - Crypt of Shade, Hills of Shade<br />
Foundation Stone Chip - 65 / 70 / 70 - named Drogmar, Stronghold of Rage<br />
Runed Stone of Wrath - 70 / 70 / 70 30 ATK 3 HP Regen (Random Drop, Razorthorn instances)<br />
Runed Diamond - 50 / 50 / 50 Mana Pres IV (TSS Quest)<br />
Relic Shopkeeper's Charm - 55 / 55 / 55 - Quested, Relic<br />
Emerald of Savage Fury - 50 / 50 / 50 - Shielding 2 (Same named Drogmar, Stronghold of Rage)<br />
Dark Void Essence 60 mana / 60 Endurance - Flight of the Seeker - DoD<br />
<br />
Also, off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
Perserved Wurine Brain<br />
Blessed Fayciate Shard<br />
Obsidan Faycaite Shard</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point was a group of six people can not complete all six MPG Raid level trials to earn Anguish access.  Thus farming Anguish augs requires having raided 1 or mroe times to earn zone access / loot rights.<br />

I'd put an asterisk next to the Anguish augments, but leave them on the list. :)</div></div><hr />

Valthon's, pretty sure that one is given by the erm 'ancient elves' section leader in Hills of Shade.. only, it wasn't until I was on about the 3rd quest in the series that I learned to buy/wear the mask items from the Mysterious Stranger in the zone (had been using sneak to do them all up to that point through the various kos camps...).  Just avoid the 'scout' / 'guard' style NPCs when using the masks.<br />

However, in order to loot in Anguish you need to either have completed all six MPG raid trials or looted the backflag Seal: Mastery of All which drops off of all the boss mobs in Anguish (KTH, Jelvan, Ture, Hanvar, AMV, and OMM).<br />
<br />
I am not sure whether you can request the instance if you have just the signets. I would assume yes, but would need to check.</div></div><hr />

We still need info on the new expansion as we (I haven't even logged on in 5months for more than 10minutes) don't play as much anymore, so any replies with more info would be great.<br />
<br />
These do not require a raid to get! Here be Galelor's list- <br />
<br />
I did swipe most of the info from Shaman forums, locked Shadowknight thread, Shadowknight forums, Warrior SoF aug thread, Allakhazam, and Lucy so that I could compile it in one spot. <br />
<br />
*edit- This is a complete list of 1 groupable AC augs, raid AC augs, and top 1 group AC augs. If someone would like to organize the info for avoidance and shielding augs in the same simple way I did the rest of the list, I would gladly reorganize my list and add them in with you credited for the work. <br />
*edit- The raid AC aug list is below the groupable AC aug list <br />
*edit- The top 1 group AC aug list can be found after the raid AC aug list. <br />
Note- Sam is hosting a static page of this info located at the fun static page. The static page may not be as up to date as this list due to this list being the source. (Important during new expansions.) <br />

Rare dropped from Alex Hutchison. &quot;To spawn Alex Hutchison clear the rectangle hallway between the ballroom and the dinning room where the doorman is. He can pop from any static spot in this hall but is rare as hell, also he's the only named in the zone I've found with 3 drops. He can also pop from the static wolves in the ballroom or mobs in the hallway before the ballroom but unless you have a killer dps group one hallway is enough. Mobs are non agro but they all assist and roamers repop faster than static so bring a solid group (puller/cc helps a lot).&quot; Also, &quot;Doorman will assist mobs.&quot; *Thanks Kithar and Bagar <br />

Freemind Cipher is south of the waterfalls in Undershore. This comes from the first mission called The Last Migration (hard.) This isn't an easy one, but it is winnable. Make sure you bring someone who can slow resistant mobs, and someone who can single pull. The named can be rooted and snared so I suggest you root to pre-debuff him, zone the agro, zone back in, and then kill him. I suggest pulling with dispel on all trash mobs. <br />

Kith MM. I guess the mission is given by a zombie braineater by RV. mission is called zombie invasion. &quot;The mission starts in the NW corner of Kithcor and turns your group into zombies; the task, kill halflings and eat their brains. Each brain can be used as a heal or to create pet zombies (in A Zombie's Guide to Procreation ).&quot; &quot;If you have a full group and focus on keeping one person full of zombies and healed that you can finish well within the time frame&quot; (&quot;60 mins to get your 80 brains.&quot;) &quot;Save the druid (farm) area until you have a bunch of zombies though.&quot; &quot;The reason for this: The field is surrounded by some fence - not very high by any means. But if you agro something in the field and is standing too far, the halflings won't warp over the fence, and in order to reach you, they will run through the house, agroing everything on the way. Keeping this in mind, it should be a tad easier to avoid the trains there.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The Dain aug is not hard to get and is big bang for your buck due to the avoidance. I personally slotted it in where I previously had a 20ac aug. I?ll try the kith mission and let you know how it goes. <br />

This drops from Argil Oppressor. He's in the west wing. In the first room you go up a ramp, and then the ph is lying on the floor in the next room. Chaotic Clay Guardian Is the name of the ph. Respawn is not very fast so you can pull all the crap to zone in if you want to feel safe. *Thanks Nodden, Dhrokhro, and Dore <br />

This drops from the boss of the maze event. Mobs /con like raid mobs but now hit like group mobs. The boss has an insane amount of hps. &quot;fc maze has 4 events, they are random, all 4 events share the same loot table. 1 event is bugged (ice golem thingy), for 2 others you need more than 1group (the one with the adds and the one where you take down the 4 corner mobs simoultanously), the last one (with the key), you can do 1group. its hard, but doable.&quot; *Thanks Khrokhro and Olts <br />
