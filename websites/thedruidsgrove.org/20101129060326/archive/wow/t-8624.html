<br />
New member here. Not only that I have the double curse of being a newbie to WoW and MMos in general.<br />
<br />
Im playing a Lvl 35 Tauren Druid and up until recently have not been doing much PvP (aside from the usual gank fest in certain zones--but that doesnt count! lol)<br />
<br />
Anyway Ive begun running with the high lvls in my guild (they like my heals! Go figger!) but Ive read how the druid is capable of so much more..tanking, dealing damage, etc in addition to healing ( I honestly dont mind being a healer--love watching my team cheer after taking down something they couldnt before because I was healing them!) and id like to start doing more of that.<br />
<br />
Last night was in STV with a guildie and we got mangled. He held his own but I couldnt seem to make anything work right. <br />
<br />
So my question is, could anyone post a link to to a PvP strategy against other classes? When I first started playing I had found one but I cant seem to find it now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ive looked at the WoW forums and theres just too much crap going on over there (flames, back biting, etc.). Hopefully this wont start one here. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for any assistance.</div></div><hr />

Group pvp is much trickier because you have to decide when tog et into bear form, and when to shift and heal your partner. And when you do shift to heal, you have to make sure you don't get interrrupted/killed before your heal gets off.<br />
<br />
The basic rule is stay in bearform as much as possible, when you need to heal use bash on your enemy, then shift and cast regrowth, then shift back to bear right away. If you have improved bash you can do all of this while he's still stunned :)</div></div><hr />

But my group tends to spread out a lot. Last night I spent a good deal of time running my cheetah hiney off to get to them, pop heal, and then back to cheetah to get to someone else.<br />
<br />
Is this normal or do I need to have a heart to heart with my guildies?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aitrus</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in pvp they shouldn't be running all over the place, certainly not so far that you need to cheetah to catch up to them. They need to stand and fight and use stuns/poisons to keep enemies from fleeing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheShambler</div><div class="date">04-11-2005, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druid is all about adapting to the situation. If the enemies start focusing on you (which is likely if you are the main healer) then throw up barkskin and go bear, your friends wont be taking any damage and so should make short work of the other players. If they don't go for you then stay in caster and heal/tangle/ff/mf, basicly keep your friends alive. If you have a priest in your group then you can go cat and have some fun :). I find most of the time a rogue goes for my throat in group pvp. Best thing to do then is to use natures grasp and keep the rogue out of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly I dont have barkskin yet being only lvl35.<br />
<br />
And yep youre right. As primary healer (at the time) I seem to have this glowing neon &quot;Kill me!&quot; sign above my Guild name. <br />
<br />
And rogues just owned me. Plain and simple. I tried NG. Resisted.<br />
Cheetah form. Stunned. Bear form. Slap slap slap, dead.<br />
<br />
Couldnt do crap. :-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid &gt; rogue by far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunken Dragon</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It saddens me to see that my fellow druids are degraded to healers only(yea i know u dont mind)... I come from a different mmo background, I usually go for the melee type... Never had a thing for caster roles... Needless to say playing a druid was challenging at first, but I feel im growing into the versatility that is the druid;-) <br />
<br />
Anyway, I follow Sham's advice in instances... The problem I usually have is when I start to aggro I'll attract mobs that aren't focusing on the main tank...If u get into an open area where there are multiple mobs, crowd controll can turn out to be very difficult.... So when I start healin the group and the mobs are after me, the tank usually got his hands full.... That leaves the others to try and get the mobs off me which they seldom do... I usually dont die because of this, but it's usually very close and I'm left with no mana to heal... Not even a rejuv...</div></div><hr />

At my level I have an aggro field on me a mile wide! I aggro things on the other side of the continent! :-P<br />
<br />
It irks me when my friends who are really and honestly trying to help me, mount up and go tearing cross country and Im left behind in my lil cheetah form. Mob mob mob die...my friends go &quot;What happened?&quot; LOL But thats ok. I know they mean well and Im in a zone I shouldnt yet be in. But I have these quests I need to finish.<br />
<br />
Maybe I need better equipment. :-(<br />
<br />
Aitrus: LOL yeah well like I said Im not 60 yet so I guess Ill have to accept being Rogue kibble for awhile longer<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks guys. <br />
<br />
Nice seeing there hasnt been a flame yet or someone calling me a Noob. Think Ive found my forums. LOL</div></div><hr />

Best tactic for helping out your group in PvP is rooting one of their melee classes, and going bear to occupy one of their rogues/warriors while the rest of your group burns down their priests/casters.<br />
<br />
As for rogues, sword specced rogues will always be a problem due to their damage output, if you can get a root off an keep him rooted (after he pops vanish) you should be able to beat him. Get stuck in caster form an cheapshotted/stun locked though, you're gonna have it tough no matter what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im spec'd in Restoration. I feel that Bear is my best ally as a healer because we can take so much more damage in bear form, shift into caster, heal, and boom right back into bear. I say bear because as a healer people wanna destroy you, such as Rogues/War’s.  Basically I believe in the Paladin type char who can Tank/Heal but with MUCH more versatility being that we are Druids.  Druids are the best char’s in the game IMO.  Im just glad people aren’t screaming NURF.  I feel unstoppable in 1vs1 fights.  Two words.. Mana Management..  Being a Tauren I have 2 ways to **** up casting with Bash in Bear form and Tauren War stomp.  Invaluable..  If you are spec'd in Feral, you have 3 ways because you have Feral Charge.  Druids also have Root also which will be nurfed soon, but its still a viable weapon to stop runners and for healing purposes.  I’ve been tearing people up in duel’s.  As for group PvP my experience is limited because im not on a PvP server and im not high enough for group raids etc..</div></div><hr />
