<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't help it, I was getting bored of worrying mobs to death as a tree so I've blown the dust off my (fairly awful gear) and respecced Kitty Feral.<br />
<br />
I'm not desparately worried about gear right now, I've just hit howling fjord and I'm in a mix of AH greens, level 70's blues and the odd purple that I found in the Hunter's LW inventory.<br />
<br />
I've used the level 70 kitty talent build from another thread.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for are some general gameplay tips, I've not used kitty form for well over a year and I'm well rusty and somewhat bemused at the plethora of attacks available to me.<br />
<br />
I remember that Mangle was the attack to spam until you filled the combo bar, but is there a best finishing move or are they situational?<br />
<br />
If I pull a mob more than can be comfortably handled am I still better off dropping into Bear form and laying down the smack for a bit or pop back to Nelf and try and heal through it (though coming from resto my healing blows!).<br />
<br />
In terms of gear what stats am I looking to boost as a priority? With a Hunter main I have a general fetish for Agility which I assume works in a similar manner on Kitty.<br />
<br />
I'm only looking to level Kitty and will be going back to Resto once I ding 80 so I'm not desperately worried about having the bestest kit to start running erics at the end of it.<br />
<br />
Your help fellow Kitties is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tend to use a combination of kitty talents as the situation warrants.  mangle for sure...then you've got either FB as a finisher that also uses all your current rage and converts it to damage or the Rip DOT.<br />
<br />
you can also pounce to get in some damage and a stun at the start of a fight which i've started doing more recently.<br />
<br />
i dont tend to often bother to stealth up behind mobs anymore - unless a couple of mobs are so close i need to...i find it just slows me down to prowl and then pounce etc and i prefer to get into action !<br />
<br />
if i pull more than is good for me in kitty i'll go bear as early as possible, whilst i've still got a good few HP's left and try to kill em all - i find going to caster to try to heal just gets me dead all the quicker if i'm facing multi mobs.<br />
<br />
you can always pop a frenzied regen or a potion or survivial instincts or maybe a trinket or if you're a herby Lifebloom can help a lot.<br />
<br />
stats wise I always look out for Agi as well as the usual crit/dodge and i am finding that i really need to get some hit now in Wrath for my kitty as i do seem to miss more, even again mobs my level. Stam is ofc always needed.<br />
<br />
have fun, kitty levelling is definitely fun.</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly obsessive about +hit on DPS gear as it's a stat many players seem to ignore until it's far too late in the day. &quot;you can't crit it if you can't hit it&quot; has become a bit of a mantra. Even for levelling, packing a reasonable amount of +hit will do your DPS no harm whatsoever.  On a general basis if I've got two nice bits of kit, one with +hit and one packed with +crit or whatever I tend to keep them both, if I go over hit cap I can switch to the gear packing higher crit stats etc and then replace one or both when an even better bit of gear comes along.<br />
<br />
Cheers for the advice, I'll have a play with the tool bars later tonight and get practicing so that I can start to rein in my hunter's cat in DPS :)</div></div><hr />

Mangle Mangle Mangle Mangle Ferocious Bite generally does the trick.  Maybe a Rake to start the process if it's on the slower end.  Feral Faerie Fire is a good pull as you approach.<br />
<br />
When you're talking about particularly tough mobs, you may want to go bear, using Mangle/Maul (again with FFF to start) and maybe work in a Demo Roar.  In this case, you have Barkskin to absorb some of the damage, Frenzied Regen on a 3m timer to give you one in-fight heal, plus potions.  If none of that's enough, you can add in Grasping Roots to back off and heal manually, plus Survival Instincts as a last-ditch if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I pull with FFF, then Rake, Mangle, Mangle, Mangle, FB.  This assumes you have RnT.  Though, even if you don't, it is still a good plan, though you might have to do another Mangle rather than FB.  And, of course, if you get a few nice crits along the way the mob might be dead before you use your finisher.<br />
<br />
If I have more than one mob to deal with, I use SR (learned at lvl 75) as my first finisher, then Tiger's Fury (I have it macro'd to trigger my DPS trinkets at the same time).  Make sure the first mob is dead then move to the next.  Opening with FFF/Rake.</div></div><hr />

Go for agility and crit, stealth and pounce to keep your downtime low.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 75 you will get Savage Roar but for leveling it is normally not as good as pounce-mangle-shred-mangle and FB.</div></div><hr />

Either I came highly recommended or they were just that desperate for a healer, they even offered to cover the respec cost :)<br />
<br />
Going back to Kitty for questing is like getting a Gorilla as a hunter, you forget just how much fun this game can actually be. I'm guessing it's more of a PvP thing, but I love the jump behind them doodah. No use whatsoever that I can discern for questing, but it makes me happy to use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you are not going to be staying kitty, +hit probably won't benefit you all that much.  It is a raiding stat.  <br />
<br />
While stregth point for point adds the most AP, I don't know that it adds the most DPS.  I don't know the math off the top of my head, but even your super nerding theorycrafters reccomend Agility over strength in most cases.  Just stack Agi and find a nice feral staff, the AP will take care of itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While I don't disagree with you in some respects given that I'm intending to chuck Feral for Resto at 80 I still wouldn't recommend ignoring +hit completely even for general levelling/instance runs.  <br />
<br />
As I understand it, and putting it basically, at the same level as you, you have a 5% chance to miss a mob if you have 0 hit rating, rising to 9% for a mob 3 levels above you. So at the very least, stacking hit to [close to] 5%  is going to give you a nice increase in DPS for levelling and 5man runs.  But you're right that I wont be marching down the street in sackcloth if my hit rating isn't at 5% :)<br />
<br />
With agility, and again perhaps mistakenly applying Hunter mechanics to it, is that in addition to Attack Power it also increases your Crit chance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
for Level 80 Feral with HotW &amp; SotF<br />
Agility <br />
<br />
1 Agi = 1.166 AP (Cat only)<br />
1 Agi = 0.01272% Crit <br />
<br />
78.62 Agi = 1% Crit <br />
<br />
<br />
unfortunately, that doesn't crunch the numbers for leveling, but it does say that agi will improve your chance to crit. For the earlier levels, you won't need as much agi to get 1% chance to crit, but i don't know what those numbers are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-05-2009, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I guess it greatly depends on leveling style. I leveled with the sole goal of getting to 80.  So, I was focusing on getting there and worrying about gear after I hit 80.<br />
<br />
1) The fastest way to level is to kill mobs 1 or 2 levels below you.  Hit is null (1% chance to miss, regardless of hit rating)<br />
<br />
2) You will have more than 0 hit, because you can't avoid it on feral gear. (read: don't worry about it, focus on Agi, the minimal hit will happen on its own.  If not, get some Extreme Snapper.  Cheap, +40 Hit/stam food)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a flat out race to 80 then yes, I agree with you on both points.</div></div><hr />
