<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-11-2008, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't currently post in the news forum, but MMO Champion has some information on the 3.0.8 patch.  Apparently quite a few druid changes in it.<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=29837.0<br />
<br />
    * Glyph of Focus -- Increases the damage done by Starfall by 20%, but decreases its radius by 50%.<br />
    * Glyph of Typhoon -- Reduces the cost of your Typhoon spell by 8%, but it no longer knocks enemies back.<br />
<br />
    * Feral Attack Power: All weapons now have the potential to grant feral attack power based on their dps (as compared to the best superior-quality weapons available at level 60).  Players will see their existing feral weapons grant roughly the same attack power as they did before (+/- 2 or so), but many new weapons will be options for the feral druid.  Some feral weapons have had strength converted to attack power to be more appealing to other classes able to equip them.  All druids will see the amount of feral attack power granted by an item in the item tooltip, if it grants any, but other players will not see that information.<br />
    * Genesis: Now works with Tranquility and Hurricane.<br />
    * King of the Jungle - The Bear effect is now physical, and thus cannot be dispelled.<br />
    * Nature's Grace - Now also effects Revive.<br />
    * Primal Tenacity: Now reduces the cost of Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form by 17/33/50% in addition to its previous effects.<br />
    * Protector of the Pack: No longer changes value based on party size.<br />
    * Savage Roar: The buff now persists outside of Cat Form but only provides its benefits while in Cat Form.<br />
    * Starfall will now be cancelled by any shapeshifting.<br />
    * Survival of the Fittest: This talent now grants 22/44/66% bonus armor in Bear Form and Dire Bear Form in addition to all of its previous effects.<br />
    * Swipe: Swipe (Cat) has now been added at level 71, dealing 260% weapon damage, costs 50 energy with no cooldown.  All talents affecting the Bear Form version affect the Cat Form one as well.<br />
    * Wild Growth now has a 6 second cooldown. <br />
<br />
    * Druid: Savage Fury - Mangle (Bear) damage was being increased by a higher percentage than intended. This has been fixed, and in result Mangle (Bear) should see roughly a 16% damage reduction. Also fixed a bug with Savage Fury where the Rake bleed effect was not being increased.</div></div><hr />

Except the mangle-nerv. But ok.. can live with that.</div></div><hr />

I'd laugh if I started seeing warriors running around dual weilding druid staves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryan4nayr</div><div class="date">12-11-2008, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle (two-handed only) now grants 25 Defense and 2% Stamina.<br />
With tanking DKs using the above, bear and DK tanks might start sharing 2H maces, which is in line with the gear consolidation scheme set by Blizz.<br />
<br />
It would indeed be funny if warriors start tanking with bo staves :icon_lol:</div></div><hr />
