There are the <br />
- Verdant Gloves ( quest reward )<br />
- neck, boots, cloak and wrists from heroic badge turn-ins<br />
<br />
Don't of course forget about Earthwarden and getting your current staff enchanted with +35 agi until then :)  Good luck</div></div><hr />

 <br />
verdant gloves are 1 quest completion away, and eartwarden is a few k rep away. i'll go see how heroics will run as a tank and start gathering those badges from there for more better gear.</div></div><hr />
