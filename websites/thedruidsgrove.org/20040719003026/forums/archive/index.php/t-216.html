<br />
My small guild decided to go to Terris Thule the other day.  To check that the flag requirement was lifted for level 55+, I took my lvl 61 warrior over in advance, and had her try to zone in.  She made it with no problems.  She has never completed the hedge event.<br />
<br />
We bring our little &quot;raid&quot; force over (all 2 groups of it), and half of them can't get in.  They all did the preflag script (I took them to do it), so everyone was preflagged.  The level 61 monk with us couldn't get in.<br />
<br />
Any ideas why my 61 warrior could enter the zone without having completed the hedge event, but the rest of the folks couldn't?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info.</div></div><hr />

Dunno how your warrior was able to zone in, maybe you had actually done the hedge maze and forgotten it, maybe some other random flag (e.g. bertox) grants access.<br />
<br />
Try going to seer in PoK, type 'what guided meditations', and post the result here.<br />

<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement:<br />
 <br />
Level 55 and over<br />
<br />
Plane of Storms<br />
Plane of Torment<br />
Plane of Valor<br />
Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
Level 62 and over<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder<br />
Halls of Honor[/quote]<br />
<br />
So ponB was never open. God knows why they opened Torment, it's not like anyone goes there for XP.<br />

<br />
As for Torment, our guild has been having a lot of fun in there lately xp'ing.  It's nice to have a whole zone to yourself.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
We'll try the &quot;unlock memories&quot; and &quot;guided meditation&quot; route and see if that fixes it for some people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ccLothar</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...like zoning into a mob, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iagoe</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some more testing.  It turns out that our 62 warrior does have the flag for completing the maze event.  The 54 druid that I have can't get into the lair any more, though I could have sworn that he could zone in a few patches ago.<br />
<br />
So it appears that you must be flagged for the lair.</div></div><hr />
