Take a Billion Indians who are bicycling or walking around and sell them CO2 and CO emitting cars.<br />

Just think, all those payment plans for 5 years, all that accrued interest, all that oil that will need to be consumed, all the insurance premiums to be paid.  Neat way to get all those Indians to be consumers, and become in debt like most everyone in the west.</div></div><hr />
