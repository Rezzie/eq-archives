It's been a handy guide for my guild when we're trying to advance into deeper endgame...<br />
<br />
I konw it doesn't really evaluate the &quot;skill factor&quot; (which is a whole 'nother can o' worms) but it definitely has its usefulness...<br />
<br />
my DPS gear rates at a 177.55, along with some suggestions for Gem improvements and enchant improvements (AND spec improvements which i don't really consider accurate)... I'm not really sure how it calculates spec, and probably isn't the best for ud druids, but there may be something to be learned form this tool.<br />
<br />
how do you rate?</div></div><hr />

It criticised me for having Nature's Grasp (which I use when soloing and in ZA) as &quot;Smells like pvp&quot; then suggested I should take &quot;Natural Perfection&quot; which... IMHO is only useful in PVP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow... how deep into endgame have you gotten?<br />
<br />
my tanking gear rates at 198.72<br />
<br />
what i like about this site is that i get messages like this: Overcapped defenses: -2.36% crit chance on you (safe to free up 59 defense or 93 RR if you prefer other stats) [?]<br />
<br />
<br />
i haven't gotten that far into endgame myself... we have Badge-a-zhan on farm, and i've seen Mag go down a couple times... my biggest problem is choosing not to raid on the weekends, when my guild is all about raiding on the weekends...</div></div><hr />

We are hoping to get into Sunwell before WotLK.<br />

I currently logged out with my healing gear on because I was off-healing last night.</div></div><hr />

need to find an update for the old mark of tyranny :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i still have green boots, the leather healer boots have yet to drop from chess, dammit and there are 5 items that i need to get enchanted, i've really been waiting to replace my blue stuff with purplez (cause im ALL about the Professor Plums) to enchant them, and my gems are pretty low quality...<br />
<br />
&lt;sigh&gt; i guess i better start healing for some heroics or something to get my healer gear a little better...<br />
<br />
it's kinda funny though... such a low score and im still at roughly +1100 for healing, which ain't too shabby, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">06-02-2008, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd rate +1100 healing to be some where in the intro area of KZ.  I know I've cleared out almost every epic that I can get in KZ and I'm up to about +1600 for my druid (who's feral).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">06-02-2008, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow... okay... that puts things into perspective a little more... i really need to stop slackin... i have the chest, gloves, shoulders, and leggings form kara. I guess i should keep more of an eye out for healer gear when it drops... there are a couple of trinkets (and those damn boots from chess) that i should be able to pick up, if the group im running with can't use it... we /roll on everything, and spec takes priority, so sometimes even though i want it, i'll pass...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">06-02-2008, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I got lucky.  For the longest time I was the ONLY druid in our group.  So I picked up almost every healing piece of leather there was.  Our priests can't use it and the pally's and shaman DON'T want it.  So I picked up a ton of great pieces.</div></div><hr />

Not by a huge margin, but with only a single piece (unequipped) of T4 at the current time, it's suggesting my Hunter will perform well in SSC and TK something I'm not sure I agree with.</div></div><hr />
