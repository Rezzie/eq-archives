<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LilWolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm getting really bored at the raptors... I'm looking for a new spot..<br />
<br />
but the weird part.  I solo while working at times... IE, while I'm waiting for something, I run and do a quad a few things... then I take my downtime.  <br />
<br />
So I'm looking for someplace thats safe to med... and can quad or rot something ever 10 minutes or so.  <br />
<br />
Cash would be great... since I've been at the raptors for a bit... <br />
<br />
btw, I have all expansions but PoP.  <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
last note.... I would have looked at the guides... but they main site is still down... any ETA on it coming back?  Thanks again</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hide between pulls, or bind at SG zone line and rest there. Other than staying away from the Ice Burrowers, all the stuff you want to kill will be animal. (read = fear/tash/charm/sense all work great here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Danaere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could try the sentient armor camps in WL for root/dotting. Nice and quiet, few gems, and the armor sells to merchants for decent plat.<br />
<br />
JaggedPine still has dark blue gnolls, more root/dot fodder.<br />
<br />
Ditto for Katta guards near the cemetary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LilWolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just tried the sentinal armor guys.  They drop pretty nice, but they really make me dream of my old harmony... sigh... harmony....<br />
<br />
But after 10 kills, I had 100pp worth of store sales... 300pp if I wanted to sell at the bazaar (if they sold for what others put there).  <br />
<br />
I did get one wanderer that cast on me... I didn't try to play with it and just gated.  I should pull back to the zone wall I guess (since I was afk for 20 minutes there and didn't have any problems)<br />
<br />
thanks for the advice.  Pretty nice little spot!  I haven't figured out if I can just nuke them down for more downtime, less wait... will try that now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love that spot! I was sad when the suits started to go LB. There's a little plateau just up above the ruins that's really safe to med on. Don't pull too close to the wall cause there are some nasty giants up around there. I was able to harmony with the new harmony no problem, it's slower, but once you get the camp broken up you don't have to harmony often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Danaere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah I only used harmony the first time I broke the spawn. After that it's pretty low maintenance. Outdoor zone = horse medding, also nice. The drops vary a lot there ~ I've left with 50pp worth of sellables, and with 500pp worth. Just luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colcannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have LoY, try checking out the boats/treasure sorters/storage workers in Dulak.<br />
<br />
Wanderers (mobs... not other druids lol) can be a pain, but avoided if you plan correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You may realize this already, but the suits drop arm/leg gems for the Thurg/Skyshring quested armor. The sell in the bazaar for 100-200 each, if you're into bazaaring. I sold some of the nicer sentient pieces there too, for a couple hundred plat each. Almost no one hunts WL any more, so you don't see that for sale very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WilkinPendelhaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found the druid's hunting guide &lt;a href=&quot;http://members.accesstoledo.com/jleizerman/HuntGuideDGGen.html&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if anyone is interested...</div></div><hr />
