Basically, they give you a word and a choice of definitions, you guess it right, and the advertisers on their site send the UN 10 grains of rice per word to be sent out to the hungry and those who can't afford the food.<br />
<br />
Sure, 10 grains doesn't seem like much, but every little thing means a lot, when you're starving.<br />
<br />
Just in case anyone cares :o, also a nice time waster when you're waiting for something.</div></div><hr />

I got to 110 when I noticed I was guessing on like 5 of them and still got them right and finally came to a word I knew a definition for and picked a wrong one just to test it out...<br />
<br />
Turns out there are actually right answers =(<br />
<br />
Really neat site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now naturally I immedietely looked for the &quot;durid&quot; option, but my jaw dropped in horror as I realised this was not one of the options.<br />
Want to know what the site claims it means?<br />
Apparently, &quot;changeling = simpleton&quot;.<br />
<br />
When will this United Nations campaign to incite racial hatred against the druidic people end? :&lt;<br />
