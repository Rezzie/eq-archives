<br />
Hell, if you want a generic &quot;What is WoW&quot; guide, the BradyGames book is better than those pay sites, at least you get something physical you can hold in your hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">r00d</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the pay sites stay more up to date with guides more then the bradygames book since the game is always changing.  I use to buy the books with the games but stopped since the game changes so much from patch to patch.</div></div><hr />

But http://www.thottbot.com/ is free and http://wow.allakhazam.com/ is mostly free (subscribe to get forumns and advanced search) both are kept up to date based on what's been found in Live by supporters that use their readers.  <br />
<br />
The site you referenced seems more of a macro/hacks/farmers guide and not somthing that I'd support.  It's also not something that the Grove welcomes advertisements for (see posting rule #7 http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=8002 ).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My roommate (a complete newbie to MMO's) almost bought the Brady book, and I sorta-kinda still suggest that she get it.  While the info will get outdated after a while, there is also a lot of &quot;static&quot; information like basic tradeskilling, good general info about classes, etc, but yeah, it is a beginner's guide.<br />
<br />
I still stand by my answer of using these types of forums for other &quot;how to's&quot; though.  Even the &quot;How to make gold&quot; guides on some of those pay sites usually revolve around one tactic - and since they are listed in a guide, more often than not the sites will be super camped (if not in an instance), or the item gets flooded in the economy.  <br />
<br />
I'm like anyone else, if I could make 500g in an hour so I could get my battlecat, well hey... but still :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pay sites are pure ripoff.  Nothing new found in them that one who knows how to use their search engine couldn't find for free.  At best, you pay for this &quot;guide&quot; and all it says is &quot;Grinding in Azshara is good place for gold because the Mageweave drops consistently and the money is good, and there 2 two chest spawns relatively close there.&quot;.  Hardly need a pay site to know something like that outside of playing.<br />
<br />
I really hate those pay sites.  All they represent are the people who are trying to make a quick buck with such catch phrases as &quot;How to get Gold/Gill/Whatever in X amount of hours&quot;.  Thottbot, Goblinworkshop, Alazahzam, even Gamefaq and message boards do a better job.<br />
<br />

Sorry for going into a rant :D</div></div><hr />
