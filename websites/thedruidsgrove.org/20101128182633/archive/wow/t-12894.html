<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As most of you know the forums are becoming less and less active. I would like to stick with it for a 10 year (1 decade) uptime April '09 but w/o the donations that used to be and w/o the support that we used to have. I am looking for a place for very low cost to keep the forums running w/o paying as much as we are now. Right now we are running at $213.00 a month, I am looking for a server that will cost right around 10-15% of this cost, many will have suggestions but its the &quot;Transfer&quot; over to this server that is cause for concern at this point. Hopefully I can get a couple PHP guru's to look and see if they can transfer it over. I certainly do not have the knowledge to do this.<br />
<br />
I will also be putting ad's on the boards to offset the cost out of my pocket. I did a test on the Priest haven forums and over the last year it returned right around 23.00 for that time period and that means it pays for 1 month on the server we move to over a period of a year.<br />
<br />
I do not want to shut down TDG nor I think those that are still here and those that may join our community would like. I am also going to make a couple calls to some of the sites I used to work with and see what they have done.<br />
<br />
Any Suggestions Please Post them.<br />
If Someone that like to help please contact me via PM, phone talk will be required to &quot;verify&quot; his/her knowledge.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

For as simple as this site is (or appears to be), I would imagine if you can get a backup of the database and the core files, getting it over to another hosting site shouldn't be that hard.  You might even look at an option like godaddy.com.  That's what I use for my blog and it has a decent set up.  But I don't know your specific size of site, bandwidth needs etc.  Running their deluxe plan was only like 7$ per month or something like that.  I'm sure you could get a beefed up one for like $20 at most if you needed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't know how cost-effective it is though, since the site owner there mentioned making the move to &quot;allow us to add CPU/Memory dynamically as needed during peak times&quot; to prevent lag.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As a history..<br />
 <br />
We been through many changes.. we were thinking this was more perminate and it was for a while.. but as times change so has donations etc.. so at this point I am entertaining many ideas.</div></div><hr />

However, interest in the site may be on the decline at the moment due to the imminent approach of the Expo.  Perhaps we will see a change in traffic (and donations!) in November.<br />
<br />
I was also asking how much the bill is, because I was thinking of just paying it :P  It will probably be a lot of money I guess, and I won't be able to cover it alone, but if you can let me know some figures anyway, that would be good.<br />

I think we have a dedicated server at the moment, which is probably overkill (a few years ago we had so much traffic that shared hosting wouldn't work anymore, but it's gone back down since then).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall cost is up - and readership donations are down.. dedicated server works great.. but w/o donations etc.. its costing us out of pocket now.. ads are fine with most but it just doesn't cover the monthly cost at this time. I just sent stats Annikk, Yrys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">11-17-2008, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As you can see we have moved to a cheaper server. All the suggestions that were made and the money that our Staff can afford per year has been taking into consideration.<br />
 <br />
We have it down to $450.00 a year $160 for licenses.<br />
 <br />
Its going to be a slower server. I have had to reboot already once.<br />
 <br />
I have paid for the $450 and will turn off the other server on the 20th of This month.<br />
