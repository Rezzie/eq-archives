This is my first thread here, but thought I'd throw this out there.  My reasoning behind this is build is to make better use of the mana regain from melee attacks.  Now if this reads correctly, Moonkin will have +300% attack power.  Not bad at all!  And, with the way I've dispersed the points in feral and in resto, I could still make use of the OoC, which I don't know why they moved.  Not too healer friendly, this is a more in your face kinda build....as far as Moonkins go.  Tell me what you think!<br />

Unfortunately no.  Your moonkin will have +300% of your level attack power (60x3=180 bonus attack power, or 210 at level 70).  Nothing too special considering the BC feral epics seem to have close to +500 attack power.  Even worse, as a % of level, not total attack power, the +300% bonus wont scale to anything more than 210 attack power, even if you get those feral epics.<br />

But unfortunatly meleekins suck &lt;swearword&gt; on the Beta server. I tried it myself.. they suck.. really.. and my meleekin really had good gear to back it up. :( They are a poor loladin at BEST (without in combat heals also)!<br />
<br />
Maybe they have some viablility in PvE.. but i seriuosly doubt it. :(</div></div><hr />

&quot;The developers do not intend for Druids in moonkin form to be able to meelee in a traditional sense. The “meelee moonkin” is meant as a way for the Druid to get back into the fight while being low on mana. It is intended for aiding the druid with mana regeneration, and not for dealing damage. Basically it mirrors the ability of other casters to use wands with Judgement of Wisdom. In fact, it generates about 50% more mana per time for a dungeon-geared Druid than a Priest would get from JoW. <br />
<br />
The “meelee moonkin” is an experimental element that the developers are still evaluating.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wish GWmort still patrolled these forums so I could /lol at him for trying to give a valid combat reason for melee moonkin.</div></div><hr />
