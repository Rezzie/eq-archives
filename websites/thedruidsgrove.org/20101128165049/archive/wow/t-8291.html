<br />
Bear form (level 10):<br />
<br />
Once you're level 10, Gennia Runetotem in Bloodhoof Village will give you<br />
the initial quest - to go to the Elder Rise in Thunder Bluff and meet the<br />
main Druids of your people. Go to TB and talk to Turak Runetotem on the<br />
Elder Rise.  He will then give you the quest to go to Moonglade, as well as<br />
teach you the teleport spell for it. He tells you to speak to a Night Elf<br />
named Dendrite Starblaze, and when you cast the spell you land right in<br />
front of the building he's at. I would advise setting your home point here<br />
in Thunder Bluff for the remainder of this quest, so you can use the<br />
hearthstone for efficiency.<br />
<br />
Make sure your hearthstone is refreshed before heading to Moonglade, or<br />
you'll have to either wait for it and risk PvP death, or wander out of<br />
Moonglade and into level 50+ zones.<br />
<br />
Now, Moonglade is a neat concept. It's Contested Territory; but it's where<br />
Druids of both races come to learn, and there is supposed to be peace and<br />
harmony throughout the area. When you talk to the NPCs, they discourage<br />
conflict and killing players in the zone is supposed to anger the guards and<br />
lower faction. Dunno if it's been implemented yet, since I saw some PvPers<br />
fighting nearby, but we'll see. Druids of both races and all kinds of levels<br />
go and quest there, so you might come face-to-face with a level 60 Night Elf<br />
during any of your time in Moonglade.<br />
<br />
Head up inside the building to Dendrite, and he'll tell you some lore, and<br />
send you to find the Great Bear Spirit in the area. The Spirit roams close<br />
to where you are, just head north/northwest along the border and you will<br />
find him. After talking to the Spirit, go back to Dendrite, finish up the<br />
quest with him, and he'll send you back to Thunder Bluff. The Elder in<br />
Thunder Bluff will then send you to find the Moonkin Stone, and to fight the<br />
Wild Moonkin Spirit.<br />
<br />
The Moonkin Stone is right as you cross over from Mulgore to The Barrens.<br />
When you cross over, there will be a hut on the right side as you're going<br />
south. Behind the hut there will be a very small open area with the Moonkin<br />
Stone in the middle of it. Triggering it pops a wild-looking bear monster<br />
that charges from the hut. He aggroes anyone close, so be sure you grab him<br />
before someone else gets aggro or takes him.<br />
<br />
The Spirit is level 13, so it would be a good idea to bring a friend along<br />
for support. I did the fight with another Druid and it was pretty easy. Once<br />
he's dead, his Spirit form will appear and you talk to him to complete the<br />
quest. Make sure you interact with him and get the (Complete) message before<br />
you head back to TB.<br />
<br />
Go back to Thunder Bluff, talk to the Elder, and Voila! You can turn into a<br />
bear!</div></div><hr />
