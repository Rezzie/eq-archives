<br />
I could really use your advice on how to better equip myself.  BTW, I tend to solo most of the time, so chances are that my upgrades would have to be soloable (no Prophecy of Ro yet) or bought at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo...<br />

Thanks in advanced!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wolficus</div><div class="date">08-24-2006, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">looking through the bazaar at relatively cheap upgrades (on Saryrn atleast...) for you, i recon:<br />
 <br />
if you can find someone to make them/find some for sale, you could upgrade the main slots with GM armor.<br />
waist: Belt of forgotten rituals<br />
back: Don probably best<br />
shoulders: good pair of shoulders drops off Odi in MPG, rots most of the time...<br />
rings: DON/ring of thunderous spirits<br />
ears: Earring of Oppression/Earring of holy fervor<br />
neck: root tender necklace<br />
secondary: tactician's bulwark<br />
range: glowing stone of expulsion/don.<br />
 <br />
for the focus effects that you lose, DON aug's are your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">08-24-2006, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with the previous poster and wanted to add.....there is silverwaiste coat belt with mana regen and boon of pious druid only save your pp for that.<br />
 <br />
I think a good way to aug out your nice master gear is to farm items on /barter that people are willing to pay for .....ie wryvern hides, forage for tufts for the haversack bags (they sell for 50pp each usually) if you don't mind trashing CoV kill the othimers they sell nicely....POI or CC has tinkering drops that people want.<br />
 <br />
Also its not great exp but when we trash Greig's end we get lots of gems to sell for pp or alchemy/rogue drops to sell to people.<br />
 <br />
There are type 12 augs on don merchant and ft augs you should buy along with the focus augs.....don't hold on to an item just because of focus if it can be replaced with aug. Like I just upgraded glowing rune of explusion.....lost muram's anger but gained ft3 and ton more hps/mana and I use citrine bobble for BA 5. When it hit 70 I will go and get the muram anger aug from DoN guy but 5% wasn't worth the super stats on korlach range item.<br />
 <br />
Hope that helps some......selling items that people are willing to buy is great way to get ur pp up.</div></div><hr />
