<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">07-24-2005, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I have been farming the Deadwoods for 2 days now to gain Timbermaw rep so I can by my warbear patterns.  I don't want to pay 10g each off AH.  Then I read thottbot and they got a new pattern in there I need honored rep to get :(  I think if I didn't work so hard to get the rep so far, I'd have to go postal on the whole lot starting with Miesha.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I heard that eventually when you get enough rep the guy outside gives you a quest to kill the Deadwoods right down the hill from him.  Anyone tell me when this happens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">07-24-2005, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've heard it's about halfway thru friendly that you can get the quest for the upper level Deadwoods.  But you don't need to do the quests, just kill any deadwood or winterfall.  You get the same amount of faction for doing the quest as killing 1 deadwood/winterfall so in the time that you are going back and forth up the road to turn in the quest you are losing faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">07-25-2005, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK I've checked while killing these things.  Not all furbolgs were created equal.  The boss yields more rep per kill than the little guys.  Turning in the quest does give a significantly higher amount of rep than a kill.  <br />
<br />
The exact amounts I don't know, but I read in a post that a guy used a mod to track the rep he gained.  He said regular kills were worth 5 points, boss is 25 points and turning in the quest yields 100.  <br />
<br />
So it depends on the situation to which is best.  If you are solo, killing the boss alone as well as just the general little ones is long a tedious.  Mounting back up there to turn in the quest may be more worthwhile though only slightly.  But at least it does kill a little bit of the drudge.  If you are one of the higher dps classes though you could probably kill at a faster rate than the quest would yield.  Same goes for any time you can partner up.  Then just going genocidal and hitting the boss every pop can get the best returns.<br />
<br />
Anyways now I'm sitting at half way through neutral, I had a good 45 minute run last night with another druid and we just went to town in anyway we felt inclined.  The most fun was when a mage joined in and we all just artillaried the heck out of em all with Starfires and Fireballs :smile: <br />
<br />
The rewards for all this hard work for those who are interested are Pattern: Warbear Harness/Leggings for friendly, Pattern Might of the Timbermaw (lvl 53 Lthr. Belt +21STR/+9STA) for Honored.  There are other stuff for different professions as well.  BTW all the honored level patterns are BOP so if you want the pattern you got no choice but to farm.  However the craft itself can be sold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You gain the same Rep by slaughtering these in a group/raid that you do by soloing them.  A 5-man group can easily clear the northern camp nonstop.</div></div><hr />
