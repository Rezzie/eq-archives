<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exedor</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently was fortunate enough to get a pair of these and thought others might be interested so here goes.<br />
<br />
What Are they? <br />
<br />
7 ac 65 mana 20 hp 10 vs magic boots with effect: Flowing Thought 3<br />
<br />
Where are they? <br />
<br />
They are in the &quot;planks&quot; area of cazic thule, very near the zone in. (Planks as in 'walk the plank matey' hehe).<br />
<br />
How do I get there?<br />
<br />
When you zone into CT, invis up and go thru the first set of doors into the courtyard. Straight accross from you there will be a ladder leading up, at the top of that ladder are a door and a pool of water, don't go through the door, instead swim down into the pool of water, you will pass some mean fish as you go but they dont see invis. When you reach the bottom of the shaft it will open into a large water filled area with more fish. Swim to the surface and you will see ladders leading up out of the water to a pedestal like area with lizards guarding a door, climb the ladder, go thru the door and follow the passage til you come to an area where wooden planks cross over rooms full of slimey water. Cross the planks to the tiny hallway area between the plank room you just passed thru and the next plank room. This is where you set up camp. A single blob creature spawns here and will likely be up when you arrive, so be prepapred to kill him.<br />
<br />
Who do I need to bring? <br />
<br />
You really want a full group for this. A 59+ SK or Pally and a 59+ Enchanter are almost mandatory for taunt and mez. Many of them can only be mezzed with Glamour of Kintaz and Warriors just cant taunt fast enough to keep the chanter alive.  A monk for pulling is also highly helpful. A cleric is really not needed if you have a 60 druid or shaman there and a 60 paladin in case anyone needs rezzed. But bring a cleric if you can, it *really* helps to have 2 healers. <br />
<br />
What do I kill? <br />
<br />
Have the monk keep pulling the blobs and mosquitos until &quot;a swirling red mass&quot; spawns, HE HAS YOUR BOOTS! KEEEEL HEEEEM! lol <br />
<br />
Other tips/ info:<br />
<br />
-Convincing the melee's to come should be no problem, since one of the best melee earrings around also drops here. +8 AC +7 Sta +7 vsDis +65 HP +0.10 Wt Warrior Rogue Monk Bard Shadowknight Paladin Ranger Beastlord  are the stats.<br />
<br />
-CR is a breeze with improved invisibility<br />
<br />
-None of this info applies to the Zebuxoruuk server, if you are on Zeb, please disregard this post, if you try it on Zeb you will be killed and lose all your gear and on Zeb the mobs there proc a spell that makes you lose five levels of exp per hit! =p<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Since the recent patch, warriors are taunting alot better here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerillea</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent about 5 days, of 8 hour farms to get 2 pairs of boots. for me and my Cleric. I personally reccomend a ranger for taunt.  Snare aggro is great for taunt.  <br />
<br />
If we pulled mutiples and mezzed mobs, our ranger would chain cast tangling weeds and Ensnare once or twice and when mez was broke.  The enchanter was never touched. <br />
<br />
A paladin and warrior can't easily do this.  After CH on a paladin/warrior my cleric always got summoned on the first CH.  With a ranger, very rarely :p<br />
<br />
Boots are common drop</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exedor</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They look really nice imo. Sort of a blood red leather.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">doh, I didnt know these had red leather look.  If I had known that I'd have not used my points to win Yelinak boots (oh what a faction pain) and gotten these boots instead, hehe.  Someday I will have that all-red look - you need these boots, dagarn the destroyer pants, Grieg gloves, chardok quest piece worn as either bracer or arms (spirit wracked cords).   Not sure what else is red look - possibly silver chains can be worn as red arms?  Still need a red bp but maybe one of the newer bp like the one with effect of void is red??</div></div><hr />

60 cleric<br />
<br />
cleric has horse (cheapie one) and Water Sprinkler of the Forgiven. Bard can pull skeeters, slimes etc (with creative use of mez). We have camped down there with relatively few difficulties (unless there are 2 PoS up) and have gotten 1 pair of boots.</div></div><hr />

Stay tuned for my next guide, it will be even shorter than this one.  :)</div></div><hr />
