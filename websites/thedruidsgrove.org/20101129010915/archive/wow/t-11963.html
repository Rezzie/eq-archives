<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kmpirish</div><div class="date">08-10-2007, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I'm expecting twins IRL.  I'm trying to figure out what to do about WoW.  I enjoy playing and I like my druid, but I'm also trying to be honest and realize that I really won't have much time to play when the babies come.  And frankly, I have to wonder if playing very sporadically is worth the money.  As it is, I haven't played in 5 months (extended &quot;morning&quot; sickness FTL).<br />
<br />
Are there parents out there who would be willing to share experiences/thoughts?<br />
<br />
An interesting twist is that my coworker has offered to buy my 70 druid.  His Alliance guild is rerolling Horde for Lich King.  So, if I choose to stop, at least my druid can go to a good home...</div></div><hr />

The only good thing about morning sickness is that we know it will eventually go away.  :thumbsup: <br />
Fortunately I didn't pick up my Wow addiction until my kids were well past the infant stage (2yr and 6yr, respectively).  But, looking back, I don't know how I would have squeezed it with working during the day and taking care of the kids and wife at night.  As it is I mainly play after they have gone to bed and an occasional hour while they nap.  Makes doing extended instance runs difficult. :-(<br />
<br />
Not to say it can't be done, but...  I think it would be hard. Sleep deprivation FTL too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">08-10-2007, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today is my birthday (HBDTM!). I'm 44. My wife is pregnant with our first boy after two girls who are 13 and 7. I love my family dearly, and have a job and a house and cars and all the assorted accoutrement that accompany them, but I also know that if all I ever did was work at the job, work on the house and spend time with the family I would go stark, raving mad. I know, because I did that for a while. Then I discovered WoW. I still do all the other things I used to do, but in moderation. My wife would argue my WoW playing exceeds moderation, but it's because she would rather have me doing chores all the time like I used to do. We've come to a happy medium. I try to respect the things I &quot;ought&quot; to be doing, while she tries to respect my need to do something that is purely for me. It's not only OK to be selfish sometimes, it's downright necessary. All work and no play... Is that really the way you want your kids to remember you when you're old like me?<br />
<br />
Raging is right about the extended instances though (nice bloody name, BTW). One of my big complaints right now is that it's really hard for me to raid. I often can't be on at times most guilds raid, and not for the time it takes to do it. That's why I like the heroic system and am thrilled it is getting enhanced in the next expansion. I can almost always find four others in my guild who can run an instance when I'm able.<br />
<br />
Really, it's all about compromise, moderation and balance. Oh, and remember- life's short. You can sleep all you want when you're dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't relate any 1st hand experience ( no kids ) but I can relate what friends have gone through.<br />
<br />
They usually take a bit of a break, and then slowly come back to playing with lots of random afks.  They don't raid, run long dungeons or anything like that, but hang out to talk to those with similar hobbies and friends and keep up with those they are/were close with online.<br />
<br />
You can always cancel your account and leave your druid dormant for a while and re-activate with the xpac or when you find more time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i play wow as my form of relaxation from work, kids and such.<br />
<br />
its not easy, a pain to keep up with everyone else's progress.  but hey... RL &gt; WoW .... well if you wanna keep ya marrage and kids around that is.<br />
<br />
basicaly i pay for the account and play when i get time, luckly i work 3rd shift so from 9pm to 3am is my normal &quot;awake&quot; time after work.  so thats my play time, kids asleep.. so its nifty</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's for sure.  Is it December yet??  :banghead: <br />
<br />
@Avearis:  Happy Birthday!!!  :dance: And don't worry - I have plenty of hobbies outside of WoW and I'm going to try and get back to them as soon as I'm physically able.  I usually go nuts if I'm not taking enough time for myself in general and I doubt the twins need a nutty mother (well, nuttier than I am already :evilgrin:)<br />
<br />
@Big9er (or anyone really):  So if I cancel my account, they won't delete my characters?  Do I have to specifically tell Blizz that I want them to keep my characters or do they do that automatically?<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if it might make more sense to go play Guild Wars or even good ole Diablo II so I can get my fantasy RPG fix with less financial commitment.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the good wishes and input :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz does not delete characters at this time.  Not to say it will never happen, but should they change their policy I'm sure they will give some kind of advanced warning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did survive, and while I was gone, I had the time of my life.  I didn't realize how consumed I was with this game until I actually got away from it.<br />
  <br />
Enjoy your new life...because, believe me, you will become consumed with your twins.  <br />
<br />
When you actually sit back down at a computer again, you will find that WoW will be still be here waiting for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">08-15-2007, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations on your impending birth!!!! Well I'm the father of three and my latest one was born in December.  I've been playing for over a year.  So I really haven't taken many breaks, but honestly I don't have twins.<br />
<br />
As with a lot of things I say its just something you do in moderation.  The first month or two, you might not get a great chance to play especially with twins.  Twins from what I've heard tend to like to alternate their awake and asleep schedules.  Then once their sleep schedules settle in, you'll get some of your time back.  Twins will always be a challenge, but for me, I get my kids to bed by 7:30 at the latest.  Mostly because they are up at the crack of dawn regardless of when I put them to bed.  Oddly my wife likes them to be reasonable... so they go to bed fairly early.  I just flip on Wow after they are in bed.  <br />
<br />
Its just something you have to balance.  I can certainly see taking a break though with Twins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwish</div><div class="date">09-12-2007, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats :) <br />
<br />
I'm sure you will find a balance between them and WoW, even if not for the first year or so. I'm a twin and my mum says she pretty much didn't sleep for about 6 months :p Let alone have time for housework/moody husbands/online games.<br />
<br />
I'm sure when I get to the point where babies are on the horizon I will also want to continue with WoW, in fact forced probably as my partner is guild leader and main tank and won't let anyone else heal him :p<br />
<br />
I would just see how it goes, if you need to leave wow for a while then it will always be there when you want to come back to it. Good luck with the bear cubs (i've heard they don't hit cat form until at least 3 years old :p)<br />

Aquatic Form - In Utero (before birth)<br />
Bear Form - 0-3<br />
Cat form / Travel form - 4-10<br />
Moonkin / Treeform - 13-adult<br />

I guess I'd be a Treeform as an adult.</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna say:<br />
 <br />
Aquatic From = Pre-birth<br />
Bear Form = 0 - 3<br />
Travel Form = 4 - 11<br />
Cat Form = 12 - 17/18<br />
Moonkin = 18/19 - 22<br />
Treeform = 23+<br />
 <br />
:)<br />

EDIT: Actually, 18/19 - 22 is Flight Form.  They fly away to college.  :P</div></div><hr />

LoL. I'm going to my oldest girl's 13th birthday dinner party in about five minutes. A dinner party. At a fancy restaurant. I even have to wear a tie (and pick up the tab for ALL her friends). But it's all good- her growing up means she'll be shifting into flight form before you know it. Wish me luck :).</div></div><hr />
