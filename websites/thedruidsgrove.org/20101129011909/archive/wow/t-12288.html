<br />
Cenarius originally instructed the night elf Malfurion Stormrage - who went on to become the first mortal druid, and Cenarius' greatest student - along with Tyrande Whisperwind and Illidan Stormrage.<br />

It's just - the typical Earthly religious refrains &quot;in the name of god,&quot; &quot;god bless you,&quot; etc, don't seem very appropriate to druids. Even when it comes to Cenarius and Malorne and Ysera and the Emerald Dream, we don't have a god or gods per se, other than maybe life itself.<br />
<br />
Which is awesome imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-24-2008, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For anyone that is interested, here is a little more recent history on Cenarius, and his current whereabouts.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Return of the [Burning] Legion<br />
<br />
Following the arrival of the orcs on Kalimdor, Grom Hellscream was sent to harvest lumber in Ashenvale.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/6/61/Hellscream-warcraftiii-cinematic.jpg<br />
Grom Hellscream<br />
<br />
<br />
This caught the attention of the Sentinels, who immediately attacked the orcs. After Grom held them off, Cenarius himself was brought to the forefront.<br />
<br />
Mannoroth, hoping to use the orcs one last time, spilled his blood into a Fountain of Life, corrupting it utterly.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/3/3c/Mannoroth.jpg<br />
Mannoroth the Destructor<br />
<br />
<br />
Grom was brought to the fountain, where he convinced his clan to drink the demonic blood with him, despite objections that doing so would go against everything Thrall had taught them. <br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/7/77/ChaosWell.jpg<br />
The Chaos Well<br />
<br />
<br />
After imbibing, the Warsongs were transformed into powerful chaos orcs who could stand up to the might of Cenarius.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/7/72/Felorc2.jpg<br />
Chaos Orc, also known as Fel Orc.  Perhaps you recognise this guy from Shattered Halls..<br />
<br />
<br />
In a titanic battle, Cenarius was killed by Hellscream, as Mannoroth had hoped. Mannoroth appeared before Hellscream and his troops moments later and enslaved them, since by drinking his blood they had made themselves susceptible to his control once again.<br />
<br />
The death of Cenarius at the hands of the orcs, demon-tainted or not, enraged the night elves, cementing their view of the savage, green-skinned (although red-skinned at that moment) creatures as their enemies. When Malfurion considered the possibility of allying with Jaina's and Thrall's forces, observing that they fought against the undead as well, Tyrande vehemently rejected the idea and cited the fact Cenarius had been killed by them as proof that they were the enemy.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/images/5/58/Tyrande-Whisperwind2.jpg<br />
Tyrande Whisperwind.  Sexy, still not dead, and resident in the Temple of the Moon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since his father Malorne was said to have a strong connection with the Emerald Dream, due to its connection to nature, Cenarius' spirit was able to live on in the Emerald Dream as a spirit of nature. The night elves believe he sleeps in the Emerald Dream while his wounds heal, and that he will some day join them again.<br />
<br />
The only clue to Cenarius's current activities comes from a conversation his son Remulos has with the spirit of Malfurion when players complete a particular quest. It appears Cenarius is now helping Furion combat The Nightmare that is disrupting the Emerald Dream, causing the corruption of The Four Dragons among other things.<br />
<br />
It is believed that he will manifest a new body and return to the world if given enough time to recover.<br />

<br />
WC3 however has decent graphics, fun gameplay, compelling storyline, and it serves as an awesome prequel to WoW if that's where you're coming from. Something to burn through on patch day.<br />
<br />
Seriously, how could you explore the World of Warcraft without ever wondering &quot;What happened here?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Anyway a lot of people play WoW and never get into the lore at all.<br />
<br />
Others like yours truly have been around a long time, but have never really studied the lore in detail because studying game mechanics always proved more fruitful.<br />
<br />
In fact, only a small proportion of players actually get really stuck into the lore.  More people should check it out though, the artwork and stories associated with it are really cool, and it adds a totally new dimension to the game when you understand the significance of meeting ingame characters like Tyrande Whisperwind.  :&gt;  And... Maeiv Shadowsong &lt;3<br />

I never read quests or pay attention to NPC dialog. There's a story before WoW too, which is kind of important, as it's the reason for things like the Plaguelands and Arthas. I simply cannot stand these kids that see the WotLK trailer and are like &quot;who is that and why do we care.&quot; What, is the past of planet Earth irrelevant too? If you're going to spend time in Azeroth its history should interest you as well. I've never in my entire life been able to understand this militant hostility to history. You'd think people would at least be curious, or at the worst neutral. But no, so much as suggest that history is important and they aggro. Even here. I'm suggesting playing a game, and the response is spiteful sarcasm.</div></div><hr />

I don't even read quest text or pay much, if any, attention to NPCs in the game.  The game could have 0 story/history and I'd still play it.<br />
<br />
I think the only game in which I actually paid much attention to the story was Ultima I (my first CRPG) and maybe Ultima IV (the NPC conversations required you to type in requests/commands free form rather than from a menu, so you sort of had to pay attention to the story to get ahead).  Also, I played U1-U4 with a buddy on his Apple ][.  He'd drive and I'd take notes.  So, as the co-pilot I had more time to consume the story than when I actually have to control the game.</div></div><hr />
