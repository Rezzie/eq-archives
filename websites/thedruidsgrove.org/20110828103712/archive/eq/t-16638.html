<br />
What was not in the patch message however, was mana adjustments, very minor ones, to our DD spells.  Rank 1s seemed to increased mana cost by 1 - 5 points, and Rank IIs decreased in cost by 10-25 points.<br />
<br />
Example Winter's Blaze increased mana cost from 574 to 575, but Winter's Blaze Rank II went from 652 to 631.<br />
<br />
The Following Spells were adjusted:<br />
<br />
	              Tempest of the Stormborn<br />
Nature's Burning Wrath<br />
Winter's Blaze<br />
	              Equinox Brand<br />
Hoar Crystals<br />
	              Annihilate the Aberrant<br />
Reaping Inferno<br />
Solarsliver<br />
<br />
The change was not limited to our class alone, seems the change effected DDs for most caster classes.<br />
