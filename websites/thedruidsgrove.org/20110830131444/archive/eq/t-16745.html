<br />
Are there armor quests for druids pre-planes?  I've been looking and all signs point to no!<br />
<br />
She will be getting fear gear soon.  However I would think there are some things out there that are good for her.<br />
<br />
Also what quests items are a must for a classic druid??  <br />
<br />
Remember no Kunark or forward!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">06-14-2008, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vermiculated armor from Plane of Fear and Armor of Harmony from second floor Plane of Hate.  In the original release, some classes did indeed have some quested class armor sets (Ranger Ivy Etched, Bard Lambent, etc) but druids were not one of those classes.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping your server still has access to the original Plane of Hate and not the revamped version that completely wrecked the spirit of the place in 2003.  Bleh.  Original Hate was flat out deadly -- I loved it.  If you are already stuck with Hate2.0, then you're looking at only the Vermiculated set.<br />
<br />
As far as must-have classic quested items?   Paw of Opolla was my very first prized possession.  I was uber with my dolly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">06-14-2008, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to consider is that some &quot;classic&quot; items now have focus effects.  For example, one item I looked, Golden Efreeti Boots, now has Enhancement Haste II on it.<br />
<br />
Some good pre-Planes items with focus effects that work up to level 44:<br />
Boots: Golden Efreeti Boots (wis+9, Enhancement Haste II)<br />
Finger: Djarn's Amethyst Ring (hp+80, Spell Haste II)<br />
Finger: Moonstone Ring (mana+30, Extended Range II)<br />
Neck: Black Alloy Medallion (wis+5, Mana Preservation II)--I think this was introduced with a 2001 revamp of Runnyeye, not sure if that's against the rules<br />
...or Chrysoberyl Talisman (wis+3, mana+20, Affliction Haste II)<br />
Face: Polished Mithril Mask (wis+7, Improved Damage II)<br />
Head: Batfang Headband (wis+3, Extended Enhancement II)<br />
Wrist: Chipped Bone Bracelet (wis+5, Affliction Efficiency II)<br />
Wrist: Serpentine Bracer (Burning Affliction II)<br />
<br />
Other items I remember:<br />
Primary: Paw of Opolla<br />
Secondary: Charred Guardian Shield (AC+10, wis+9)<br />
...or Testament of Vanear (wis+10, mana+10, Mana Preservation I)<br />
Range: Small Wisdom Deity (wis+2) (not sure when it was introduced, the recipe was discovered by accident, but it uses only old-world parts)<br />
Chest: Foreman's Tunic (wis+3)<br />
Arms: Platinum Armband (wis+3, Mana Preservation I)<br />
Legs: Gatorscale Leggings (wis+4, hp+15)<br />
<br />
Resist gear may be tough, since some of the old jewelcraft-produced items can no longer be made.  Are new jewelcraft items allowed?<br />
<br />
What about items that drop from old world zones but didn't exist at the time?  For example, this appears to have been added to Lower Guk in 2007:<br />
Swamp Stained Leather Arms<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM<br />
Slot: ARMS<br />
AC: 10<br />
STR: +3 DEX: +3 STA: +3 CHA: +3 WIS: +3 INT: +3 AGI: +3 HP: +25 MANA: +25 ENDUR: +25<br />
SV FIRE: +3 SV DISEASE: +3 SV COLD: +3 SV POISON: +3<br />
Recommended level of 35. Required level of 30.<br />
Focus: Improved Damage II<br />
WT: 0.8 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: DRU MNK BST<br />
Race: ALL except ERU HIE DEF DWF GNM FRG<br />
Slot 1, Type 7 (General: Group)</div></div><hr />
