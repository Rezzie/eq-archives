http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70023<br />
<br />
I see that most posts recommend to get ornate. I know they will help my SUmmer's Flame, but who uses it that often? <br />
<br />
I see the prices of Ornate gloves dropping, so I am sure there is much better out there now. <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on gloves? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
I mostly solo, but will group some now that I am getting up in levels.</div></div><hr />

They are player made, and while they aren't much different than druid ornate (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=13589), it's a similar item you could look for. Depends on the price I guess on your server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagrin</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, those are similar in stats. <br />
<br />
It is hard to believe that we have so few choices in our gloves. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Supple Black Gloves (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19438) - event looks easy enough although I've not done it.<br />
<br />
Gloves of Waking Dreams (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26947) - These are random off some mobs in Qinimi (rare)<br />
<br />
Gloves of the Great Earthquake (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26336) - also rare off qinimi mobs<br />
<br />
speckled clay handwraps (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27561) - off a named in Riwwi.<br />
<br />
You can solo in qinimi but those drops sound rare, the other two things require some sort of group but the nameds drop all sorts of stuff to incite others to join you there. <br />
<br />
There's tons of upgrades in LDoN and Tradeskilling hand slots too.<br />
<br />
I recommend you take a look at this equipment tool (http://www.cardplace.com/eq/config/index.cgi) if you haven't seen it and don't mind using spoiler info (which presumeably you don't since you're asking here :rolleyes: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What kind of mana preservation focus effect do you have for your nukes right now?  You might want to consider going with ornate gloves for now anyway since they might make Summer's Flame more mana efficient for you than any of your other nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagrin</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the ideas and that link. <br />
<br />
I have SCM 3 and the ornate boots for mana preserve.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
or Pristine Jeweled gloves (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=44297) from hard nro ldon<br />
 <br />
or Muramite Leather Wraps of Conflict  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=71065)<br />
 <br />
or app a elem guild and get elem leather gloves (o trust me they rot a lot ;p)<br />
 <br />
If you use summer flame when you solo ornate all the way, foci &gt;&gt; stats, but if you mainly dot go with pristine or the muramite ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">12-22-2004, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would still suggest ornate, the focus effect is much better than ornate boots.  I did go with nuke aas because of quad kiting and then found that with ornate gloves solo nuking mobs works quite well too.  <br />
<br />
It also lets us get in an amazing burst of nukes on just a small amount of mana sometimes.  On raid mobs we really can drop a world of pain once agro is fully locked down.<br />

<br />
Hopefully, I can find the ornate at the low price I saw the other day.</div></div><hr />
