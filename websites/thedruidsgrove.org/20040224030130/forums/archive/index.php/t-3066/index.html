<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daeneb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a list of clickies that are considered &quot;essential or at least very useful&quot;?  For instance, the epic :) .  What else do people find to be essential?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out the &lt;a href=http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovedruidicequipment.showMessage?topicID=26282.topic&gt;Toy's [sic] for Druids....&lt;/a&gt; thread.<br />
<br />
I'll add &lt;a href=http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=13401&gt;Manastone&lt;/a&gt; to the list, even thought it's the worst, most useless item especially now that LDoN is out.  (*cough*)<br />
<br />
I also find &lt;a href=http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24890&gt;Holgresh Elder Beads&lt;/a&gt; very useful for scouting and pretargeting on pulls, in addition to the necro benefits.<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tubben says:&lt;hr&gt;Amulett of Necropotence - BEST klicker ever.[/quote]Never understood that.  Outside of being a targeting/see-through-walls cheat, what is the point of this item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The point is to use it against a dispelling mob. AoN is an instant click, from your inventory that you don't have to take the time to target yourself with and it works indoors and out.<br />
<br />
I agree that it's the best insta click item ever. Next would prob be the gobby skull earring but it has so many stacking issues now and it also takes up an equipment slot.<br />
<br />
I don't consider the epic an essential clicky item. I never pull it out of my bag anymore. It all depends on your level and play style though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Amulet of Necropotence has a downside: the illusion undoes any shrink spell that has been cast on you, even if you're refreshing an existing illusion skeleton spell.  In some places everyone is asked to shrink, making the AoN a bad thing.<br />
<br />
I'd say the Sigil Earring of Veracity is the best instaclicky item (clicky self-only acumen, usable from inventory).  Too bad it's not exactly easy to get. :P  The spyglass is a good one too.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'd add Necrotic Divining Device to the list of clickies to get.  In addition to finding people's lost corpses, it's great for targetting corpses stuck in the wall, and for finding mob corpses that got left behind in LDoN (happens very frequently to me).<br />
<br />
The manastone still has one major use: mass imbuing.  A year ago it used to take me an hour just to imbue enough emeralds to make 20 attempts at the mistletoe cutting sickle...<br />
<br />
Then there's the Green Flower of Functionality from PoM (or String of Beaded Slime from VT).  They have a buff that adds 50 to poison resists and stacks with everything.<br />
<br />
Hmm, there are a whole bunch of clicky toys from VT that are worth getting.  Silver Skin Gauntlets has a clicky 150 point self rune.  Bone Earring of Evasion has a fixed duration 27 minute self only IvU.  Ring of Resistance has clicky +10 to all resists that stacks with just about everything.  Armguard of Piety has clicky Abolish Poison, though I suppose with Pure Blood it's no longer very important.  Bracelet of the Shadow Hive has clicky targettable shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>VereSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not sure they're the best..but I use frequently..<br />
<br />
Jboots<br />
Crown of Hatred<br />
Bangle of disease warding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quaras Shadowscythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Uh, why are manastones useless in LDON?  Low on mana, gate to entrance of dungeon, rebuff, resow, stone, regen on your way back inside.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Depends on your zone time I guess.  It takes me over a minute to zone each way most of the time, so I really don't end up saving much time (especially if I have decent mana regen buffs already), plus the group would probably not be able to do much if I was the only healer until I got back.  If I just sat to med, the group could at least start hunting again quickly, since I rarely need a full bar of mana for one fight.<br />
<br />
I also like leaving my bind point in twilight sea so I can kill shades for swirling shadows while waiting for a rez anytime I die. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OK, first, he said &quot;*cough*&quot;  He was being facetious.  Manastone is more worthwhile than it's been in ages.  I mean, who ever fought in old world zones in the last 2 years?  Now it's good for more than just mass imbues/enchants.<br />
<br />
And you don't have to move your bind point.  Just Egress, zone out, get stoned (!! =), and zone back in.<br />
<br />
We've only done it once, on a near wipe, but it was nice to be able to do it.  Also nice for buffing, before setting out on the mission.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wasn't being facetious, I was being discreet to avoid attracing the nerf police -- which you've just done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I doubt they'll nerf it.  They don't want people using them IN the zones where they're hunting.  Since you have to zone to use them, they are purely situational, and not really unbalancing.  If they were so worried about them, they would have removed ages ago.<br />
<br />
And I'm not the one who mentioned them in the first place ;P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best thing about aon is that it DOES overwrite shrink.  I hate being shrunken, so i just use illusion potions to kill shrink since I don't have an aon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Essential?<br />
<br />
I guess it depends how lazy you are  ;) <br />
<br />
Ornate BP and legs provide very useful clicky effects: group replen and savage roots.<br />
<br />
Sand Eroded Shell frees up a spell slot when charming, and neatly sidesteps Savage Spirit's 45 second recast delay of the spell version.<br />
<br />
The White Ceramic Band is nice for pulling.  A Silvery Mask provides the Identify clicky effect for random info, useful for quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khardan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shawl of Awakenings is a super useful clickie. . .5/tick mana regen that stacks with everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh, they'll nerf it. Don't you worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well...shawl of awakenings stacks with _almost_ everything.<br />
The exceptions:<br />
Maelin's Methodical Mind (8 mana/tick, 5 hp/tick) on Shawl of Eternal Forces<br />
Aura of Eternity (5 mana/tick, 5 hp/tick) on Celestial Cloak<br />
Lunar Whispers (2 mana/tick) on Talisman of the Burrower and Twilight Shroud</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The shawl has been in game for more than a year I doubt it will ever be nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the nerf comment was in reference to the manastone, not the shawl. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ravara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The manastone has been in game over a year, I doubt a nerf would supprise many people.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Netura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I agree with the amulet of necropotence...<br />
<br />
and above all the raid/growth benefits(like the ability to easily walk up the stairs in kael), skelly form+epic=so cool looking!</div></div><hr />
