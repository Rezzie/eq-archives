<br />
When I'm in a 5 man instance and acting as 'the healer' and finally start to get pounded on by mobs I shift to bear and yell for assistance.  My guild say that it is the responsibility of the group (especially tank) to get the mobs off me and so I should stay put until they come to aid.  Fine in theory and I tend to think that if I use feral tactics I'm just going to make it harder for the tank to get the mobs back off me.... BUT, what happens when the remainder of the group can't or wont get the mobs off?  Having been in the situation where I've died waiting for the others to get the aggro off; I'm now thinking there must be a plan B, C or D out there somewhere!  After all druids don't have sound aggro reduction tactics so I'm presuming that Blizzard reckoned that us hybrids should be able to get out of trouble by other ways.<br />
<br />
So what would you suggest for plan B?  Do you use feral skills to fight the mobs and then commit to killing the mobs before attempting to go back to healing role, or is there a risk of just attracting more mobs which then make the healing even more difficult?  How long do you wait, or how critical do you allow your health (or health of the group) to get before you decide that you're going to have to do something about it?  <br />
<br />
Am I being a poor player by not using the role versitility to manage the situation?  I read the posts on these forums about what other players can do with their druids and I tend to think 'Man.... I'm an utter novice!' Please give me some help!<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

If you can run towards the tank without gaining more aggro from other mobs then do that....that way you take the mobs to the tank and he can work on getting aggro off of you before you have to do much of anything else.  <br />
<br />
In that situation (if you can make a clear run to the tank) I would switch to bear form to make sure I can take the hits and then run to the tank (don't attack) so that he/she can work on getting aggro from the monster.  If you attack it just makes more work for the tank to get the aggro off of you.<br />
<br />
Now if the path isn't clear, try and say something in party chat if you can so that someone else knows to help you out somehow (whether it be a mage freezing them or sheeping them, or some other form of crowd control).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps some.  That's just what I've had to do at times.  Makes me miss my Priest and her Fade when things like that happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on certain fights when you know the warriors are having a hard time keeping multiple mobs on them, and you pulled one... go catform and cower when it gets close. it'll go away. if you pulled more than one, and the warriors are all pre-occupied, then you just have to improvise and wish yourself luck. :)<br />
<br />
like on noth the plaguebringer fight, the warriors are usually pre-occupied in their assigned corners. they try not to stray too far away, or else they'll miss a skeleton spawn. healers will pull something most of the time. since the small skeletons hit for around 2k on leather, u can try to move it close to any warrior, but u don't have a lot of time (4-5 hits in bearform). i find it easier to just cower it off, and heal whoever the skeleton goes to, and let the raid know we have a loose skele.</div></div><hr />

While the mob is stunned, I un-shift and back away.  If noone has grabbed it by the time the stun ends and it charges me again - Cat and Cower or just beat the living snot out of it!  (I'm not gonna stand around and die waiting for someone else to come help me).<br />
Yeah shifting &quot;wastes&quot; mana for healing - but if the Tank isn't doing his/her job 100%, why should I be expected to do mine :P?</div></div><hr />

Lorath, can you clarify what you mean by 'HT10 through the damage'.  Also does self-healing make it harder for Tank to re-claim aggro? (or do you find that the extra time you gain counters that in that it gives the Tank extra time to get mobs off you).<br />
<br />
Also, with the cat + cower, from the posts am I right in thinking that that is a strategy for when there is only one mob attacking?<br />
<br />

So yes, you do generate threat, causing the mob to stick to u. Well, unless you're a Paladin. Their heals give off very little threat from what I've heard. Blizzard did it to prevent them from using heals to hold aggro, which takes away the glory from Warriors (MT role).<br />
<br />
Anywayz, if you heal yourself a lot while a mob is on you, the warrior can only taunt it off temporarily. Unless they took notice of u healing yourself (rarely), they would prolly drop a single sunder (if any at all) only. Not to say that I don't heal myself sometimes, but it depends on how critical the situation is.<br />
<br />
In certain raid encounters, we assign healers to heal other healers. eg. Nefarian.<br />
<br />
As for cower, it's a single target skill. So yah, if you have more than one mob on u, u can only cower away one every cooldown. :O<br />

Generally speaking in instances heal agro comes form mobs that have broken crowd control... while CC'ed they gain agro on the healer and whoever was casting CC on them primarily.  Warriors should be able to pull agro off you while your chain healing yourself.  I use bear most times... stun and heal.  Just don't start mauling/swiping... unless you want to tank. <br />
<br />
Also, if you find your regularly gaining agro in a group... gear for it.  End game druids should have some AC options, like Warden Staff, Cloak of Protection, etc. pop those on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing Touch (Rank 10) and just weather the hits is what he's saying.<br />
<br />
I have always gone to bear, taken the hits.  You get enough rage to frenzied regen if you must, buty most often the mob is peeled off you.  A druid is a master of adapting to the situation.  The cower tactic is great as well.</div></div><hr />

Cloak of Protection?  do you mean cloak of warding?</div></div><hr />

The warrior will taunt the mob off me and Ill keep healing. In MC, when I hear my CT raid tell me your about to get pwnt by a molten destroyer for healing too early or a lava pack, I shift to bear and run to a tank asap.</div></div><hr />

Until you get used to it, it may seem strange to walk towards where the tank is holding the other mobs, it looks like walking into danger rather than away from it.  But once you walk up and get the tank to taunt him off and walk back, you'll start to feel more like your group is controlling the mobs then reacting to them, and then you've got this game beat.</div></div><hr />
