<br />
I would suggest working up to farming Cenarion Expedition rep over to the west, in Zangarmarsh...<br />
<br />
but first, make sure you get this idol:<br />
<br />
Idol of the Wild (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28064)<br />
Binds when picked up<br />
Unique<br />
Relic	Idol<br />
Equip: Increases the damage dealt by Mangle<br />
(Cat) by 24 and the damage dealt by Mangle<br />
(Bear) by 51.75.<br />
<br />
The quest to obtain this is in west Hellfire Peninsula, here:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10132<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so after you've got your idol, I'd also suggest getting Bladefist's Breadth:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28041<br />
<br />
Also a Hellfire Peninsula quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, I personally would start going to the Slave Pens instance in Zangarmarsh.  Keep any unidentified plant parts you find, and hand them into the npc at the Cenarion Expedition camp in east Zangarmarsh - just across the border from Hellfire.<br />
<br />
Once you reach honored, you can't hand them in for rep anymore.  At this point, do all the CE quests in Zangarmarsh, and also make sure you also do the Sporregar quest for the Underspore Frond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28111).<br />
<br />
The idea is to try to get as good a rep as possible with the Cenarion Expedition - this is important because the CE quartermaster sells a lot of extremely nice druid items, such as Earthwarden (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29171), which needs Exalted.<br />
<br />
If you only focus on one faction while levelling, make sure it's the Cenarion Expedition.  :&gt;<br />

I didn't give my Reputation any regard until it was too late.  Now I find myself back-tracking because I am only Honored with certain factions when I should be well into Revered or Exhalted by now.  <br />
<br />
Sticking around one area a little longer is also worth its weight in gold - literally.  Gold in Outlands will practically fall into your lap if you know how to get it.  Just run dungeons all you can, whenever you can.  Try not to ignore the dailies available to you.<br />
<br />
If you are running your main, you are gonna want (and need) your Flying and Epic Mount.  Of course being a Druid, you are a flying mount, but your Epic flight form takes gold.  Lot's of it. <br />
 <br />
Somebody graciously posted this site on the Grove for me in the past, and I am now posting it for you.  <br />
<br />
http://www.wowreputationcalculator.com/<br />
<br />
I recommend you use it.  It's very helpful.<br />
<br />
And, welcome back to the game.  Outlands is great isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Do every quest in the first 2 zones.  They give you quite a nice base of gear.  Especially the group[2] and group[3] quests.<br />
2.  Buy, or farm, 360 unidentified plants and turn them in at the CE town in Zangarmarsh.  This will get you to honored with CE.<br />
3.  Do all CE quests in HFP, Zang, Terrok Forest, BEM and the 3 in Netherstorm.<br />
4. Run SV a few times 'till you are exalted.<br />
5. Buy Earthwarden for tanking<br />
6. Get a group of 5+ lvl 65+ and run the Ring of Blood quest for a great Kitty staff.</div></div><hr />

I'm a full Resto Druid but will be picking up some of the Feral pieces because sometimes I like to go all wild and hairy like.</div></div><hr />
