I got bored of raiding when I had reached 60 and quit until quite a bit after TBC came out. I've  done a little leather working &amp; skinning but stopped somewhere before I quit the game. So unless I'm wrong, I won't need Scryer or Aldor or even Ceneron reputation.<br />
<br />
There are keys I assume I need for certain instances and for Kara. I suppose I'll work on them. <br />
<br />
What are the daily quests for? I keep hearing they are good for quick farming of gold.<br />
<br />
What else do people do at 70?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Level alts<br />
- Dailies for gold<br />
- Get your epic flying mount ( and epic flight form )<br />
- max out rep with factions ( depending on spec Cenarion Exp. will get you one of the best pve tanking items period ).<br />
- Kara key, Arc key, Shadow Lab key, Shattered Halls Key ( and heroic keys ).<br />
- max out professions<br />
- pvp ( arena and or bgs )<br />
- raid<br />
<br />
The new raids are quite different than pre bc, maybe you want to give it another shot.  <br />
<br />
Arenas can be fun if you are part of a group of some friends and have fun going *schwoot* around a corner to LOS some noob ( points to whoever gets the reference ).</div></div><hr />

Leveling alts is not my thing unfortunately. <br />
<br />
I'll probably end up raiding for now, working on my Kara key. PVP might be fun, tried it before but no arenas of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-28-2008, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heroics are fun.  Something to work towards, you probably shouldn't try to run them until you're properly geared and spec'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-28-2008, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP is a blast because you can jump on and play for a few games and have a sense of accomplishment (edit: accomplishment = welfare epics which will make life a LOT easier with anything else you do in WoW.)<br />
<br />
Other than that, epic flyer is something huge to work towards, and dailies are the best way to do that.  <br />
<br />
Professions are helpful to level to make money for your epic flight form.  <br />
<br />
Scryer / Aldor is mainly for the shoulder enchants.  You will want to pick up one (look at the enchants to decide which will be best for you) so that you can add on those extra stats to ur gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i also quit raiding at 60 Pre BC when a raid guild i was in fell apart and i decided there might actually be life outside of Wow ! (sorry if i have shocked those of you with a nervous disposition :rolling: )<br />
<br />
took a 6 month break last year after levelling to 70 but not having much to do nor anyone to do it with.<br />
<br />
came back last Dec and now i basically fill my time with :<br />
<br />
Daily's - never ever had so much money !<br />
Rep - building up my rep with various factions for the epic flying mounts or nice items from the quartermaster.<br />
5 mans - they are fun and they are different to the ones pre BC. doing them heroic adds a new incentive as you can save up the badges the bosses drop for nice new items. (means you dont have to pvp :))<br />
<br />
<br />
I can quite happily fill my time allowed doing this without even contemplating 10 or 25 man raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be fair, 10 / 25 man raiding is a LOT different and more fun than the 40 man raids ever were.  Still a time investment, but the instances are far more fun, and its much quicker to move from boss to boss.<br />
<br />
I swore after a ridiculous amount of time spent in MC and BWL that I'd not raid in TBC, but I got back into it slowly and am enjoying seeing all the content and stuff.<br />
<br />
But yeah, if you're not into that, do dailies, run 5 mans if you have some hours to kill, and PVP A LOT with a warrior rogue warlock buddy :P  You could also attempt to finish every quest in all the Outland zones (massive gold and rep), and if you are really hard up for something to do, level fishing and cooking.  Oh, and head up to Ogri'la in BEM and grind mobs up there (or get a group to kill the 4 large dragons) for the Depleted Badge drop (turns into the badge of tenacity which is the best druid tanking trinket in the game).  There are a lot of nice epic crafted items (leatherworking) for druids that other ppl on your server can make, so you could grind out the mats for those.  <br />
<br />
Too much stuff to do at 70 IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">05-01-2008, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i really enjoyed the 40 mans but cannot comment on how fun in comparison the 10 and 25's are.  and i never got bored tbh in mc / bwl. the time seemed to flow through a raid.<br />
<br />
if i had the time i'd certainly like to try kara but with a new baby etc its not possible to commit to the sort of stuff a raid guild wants or requires.<br />
<br />
and i play wow for fun, its not a job and i dont want some 15 yr old giving me a hard time cos i was a bit late to a raid cos of work or the baby.<br />
<br />
yeah there is a lot to do at 70 without raiding.<br />
<br />
and i've yet to even level cooking :p  will never level fishing, i'd slit my wrists b4 i got to skill 100 !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">05-01-2008, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I leveled fishing to close to 200 in the pond in Org while waiting for arenas back when 2 man queues were like 10 minutes.  Couldn't really think of anything else to do during that time (as I have no gathering profession, otherwise I'd be flying around terrokar).<br />
<br />
Kara is fun.  Shouldn't be hard to find a pug for it that lasts 3-4 hours for a full clear.  Very well geared ppl (t5 / t6 equivalent) are always LF1M as they go on guild badge runs.  We ended up taking some fresh 70 shadow priest in greens the other day cause we needed 1 more (and his buffs), and he got like 4 pieces of gear and 20 somethign badges :P</div></div><hr />

Couple of hours each night and your done.  I actually think more groups do it over 2-3 days just so they have time to do other things (dailies, bg, arena, etc.).</div></div><hr />

from my experience people who can and do raid will just run it in one evening cos they are doing 'proper' raids 3 or more other nights ?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I've been 70 for over 6 months now, and never run a heroic intance. Hell, I have not seen half or more of the regular instances. No one ever wants to group. LFG channel is always dead. I have enough to do with work and my baby to keep me occupied.</div></div><hr />

Hell, there are pug karas, za, mags, gruuls etcnon stop.  <br />
<br />
I've had friends transfer off and come back  (*cough* Trixtaa *cough*) cause other newer / low pop servers suck.<br />
<br />
And yeah, you can do kara in 2 nights if you want.  or you can just join a group and do a part of it.  No one says that you have to stay the whole time.  I just ran a FULL clear this weekend in 2.5 hours with a pug.  <br />
<br />
But, aside from raiding, there is still TONS of stuff to do:  Make crafted gear, rep grind, level professions, do dailies, lvl alts, etc :P</div></div><hr />

I transferred from a high pop PvP server (Archimonde) to get away from the &quot;733T L2P /spit&quot; type players and it has mostly worked!!  I'm now on a medium pop RPPvE server (Steamwheedle Cartel) and LFG is &quot;OK&quot;.  It could be better (need more healers), but it keeps me happy when I don't have guild work to do.  I'm also part of a large (200+ accounts, 300+ toons) casual guild so I can always help someone out on a group quest, low-level 5-man, etc. if I can't find &quot;real&quot; work (lvl 70 5-mans, heroics or the occasional Kara run).</div></div><hr />

The realm you are on and what faction you play makes a huge difference.  Research your desired server type (PVP or normal, RP or not), look at their populations, and look at the alliance/horde breakdown.  Aim for a medium-high population server ... these servers have the population to support PUGs without having insane wait times to get online.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I have tried some of that. Hell, I dinged 70 not even trying. I was just grinding mats for my Frozen Shadoweave set. Both my professions are 375, Alchemy and Tailoring.  I just get too bored. I don't want to play a MMO by myself, period. And I have a ton of alts. Just got my Hunter, Mage and Warrior to 40. My druid is still 24. Just can't seem to level him. All the other classes have an easier time.<br />

I don't want to play a MMO by myself, period.I was the same way for some time.  Eventually I found a casual guild that, while not perfect, seems to provide what I need.  You have to look as no one is looking for you.  Post a message in the Realm's forum stating what sort of guild you would like to be a part of.  Someone will respond.  It worked for me!My druid is still 24. Just can't seem to level him. All the other classes have an easier time.Other classes have an easier time leveling or obtaining groups?<br />
<br />
Assuming you are leveling feral, I will be the first to admit that leveling a Druid is a bit tedious until lvl 36.  0-10 are easy, 10-20 are painful (bear sucks for dps and root-n-nuke I just couldn't get), 20-24 aren't too bad as you finally have some good dps.  24-36 are annoying because you don't have enough dps to kill something fast enough before it does a bit of damage which means you will find yourself shifting out to heal every 2-3 mobs which is more often than I liked (though with the instant shift added a couple patches ago it isn't near as bad as it use to be).<br />
<br />
However, once you get pounce at lvl 36, the leveling woes are over.  Prowl--&gt;pounce--&gt;shred--&gt;FFF--&gt;shred--&gt;claw--&gt;Rip rocks!  Eventually (say lvl 62+) you can just do FFF--&gt;mangle*4--&gt;rip which is even faster.  But the prowl method isn't too bad with the right macro and learning not to prowl until you are on the edge of the mob's agro radius.<br />
<br />
All classes have dead spots in their leveling, for feral Durids it seems to be a bit too long (24-36).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all about having a good guild really.  The best way to find one is to run pugs (/shudder), and talk to people in there if they seem cool.  Check out the wow realm forums, and look at each guilds website to see when they raid (if you want to raid at all, need to be able to make the times), etc.<br />
<br />
Or, convince a RL friend or two to play WoW, and level one of your alts with him / her and boom, problem solved :P</div></div><hr />

Even if you have a few RL playing, they all seem to level at different rates, etc. so you will spend the first 2-6 months solo.  Then you are expected to find a group to have &quot;fun&quot;, unless you are into BG PvP (or noob ganking).<br />
<br />
WoW really needs to make pug match up easier (the LFM/G UI is a joke) and more of a &quot;requirement&quot; to level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">05-07-2008, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I find the LFG tool to be OK. It was better than what they had before which was nothing really. Ironically the one in EQ was somewhat better but it took them too long to put one into the game. I have had pretty good experiences with PUG's in regular instances.<br />
<br />
More of a requirement to group after 45 would be good or even 50 these days might be good.</div></div><hr />
