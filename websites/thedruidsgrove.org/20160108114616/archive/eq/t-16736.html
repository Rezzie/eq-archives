ive been playing EQ since it first cme out on and off rather sporadically. I now have a 61 druid and since I havent been keeping up with everything i think im &quot;druiding&quot; incorrectly. I always seem to run out of mana and am not real familiar with the  other strats( did pretty well quadding drakes in cobalt scar).<br />
<br />
Please, can anyone tell me the best strategies (as in-depth as possible) and where some good spots are. also, any advice on gear and AAs would be appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

The druid's mana regen utility blows completely, so the best way for u do keep is to ration it and use it wisely. For soloing I would try charming it is faster xp just snare the mob before u do charm it or when it breaks it will come and eat ya. For gear look into TSS, TBS, and SoF eras for gear and I would even go as far as culture armor if u got the cash. For AAs stick to Healing AAs and then defensives. Afterwards, do as u please.</div></div><hr />

Really hadnt ever considered the possibility. Is there anything that helps charm? Also, what EXACTLY is root/rot? anything more specific on gear? im completely clueless to &quot;era&quot;-d gear.<br />
Finally, which spots would you recommend?</div></div><hr />
