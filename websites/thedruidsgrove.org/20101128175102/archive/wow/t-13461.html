<br />
DK and myself from guild, then 3 friends from 3 other different guilds.<br />
<br />
I was hoping our in training and in gearing warrior guild tank would arrive but alas it turned out he had RL issues.<br />
<br />
So we blitzed HoS, not been there for a while tbh and really enjoyed it.  That Bran even is still a bit of a challenge even with a good grp.....a couple of us thought Blizz had added in an extra 2 waves of mobs as the event seemed to go on longer than we remembered.<br />
<br />
Still the pally with us got the nice epic plate wrists and the mage the blue Ember trinket so  a good run.<br />
<br />
Then we blew through Gun - i do like that place. Its fun...although we never have the right group makeup for doing the achievement on Moorabi - we stop 2 or 3 transformations but never enough.  more rogues i guess !<br />
<br />
I ended up tanking Eck for a while...DK tank said his cooldowns were still cooling down ;)  I kept thinking he'd grab it so kept casting ! lol.<br />
<br />
Finally Drak - i said at the start can we now please finally do the damn Dinosaur achievement as we had a good grp. i was doing 2.6k dps and the others were 2 to 2.2k so we were killing things nicely.<br />
<br />
Then the healer says can i bring my rogue and the mage says ok i'll bring my healer...../gulp.  Will they be upto doing the achievement.<br />
<br />
Previously the DK tank has never wanted to try it but this time i just said we have to pull Dred and then kill all 6 of the minions before Dred.<br />
<br />
And it was no problem - even through the fears we were ok.<br />
<br />
So we all got the achievement.<br />
<br />
All in all a good evening.</div></div><hr />

That achievement is pretty fun, imo.  Kind of like &quot;Lightning Struck&quot; on General...Bjarngrm or whatever his name is in HoL. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-30-2009, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Des. It was nice to finally do it.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are a few achievements that I dont even know exist as they are not something i am really interested in.<br />
<br />
But it was nice to it.  And i would like to do the Gun one but we never have enough interrupt ability.</div></div><hr />
