Yes, there are mobs in fire, a  young obsidian spider...but they are at zone in and really no way to get it to the second castle area where all the groups/exp are.<br />
<br />
It still is usefull for farming in low level zones, but as i don't do that...in my<br />
opinion, it is a waste.  Possibly some mobs in Dranik's scar, so possibly help<br />
if you wanted to do faction or fight for the two ukun camps but nothing else in OOW, Gates (aside from Natimbi by beach), don, nor most likely the new<br />
expansion.<br />
<br />
If you disagree with me...let me know, so i can possibly rethink my waste of 9 aa.</div></div><hr />

So it's at least potentially minimally useful past HoH.  Not very useful, and not worth 9 AA nowadays...  but it was useful enough when I was grouping there a lot.<br />
<br />
Like some other skills, it doesn't scale well as levels go higher and we fight nastier mobs.  Some skills scale pretty well (exodus and innate camo still seem like GREAT AA to me, even though some mobs do see invis and all).  But Dire Charm, because it's tied to a max mob level and because we don't see many animals/mobs that low in the zones we hunt at level 70, simply doesn't scale well.</div></div><hr />

Most of them are undead, there's 1 type of DC bait raven that's druid charmable though.  It's just a rarer spawn.</div></div><hr />

I can charm the other with my chanter, I usually play my monk/druid/chanter, the extra dps with 2 dc pets is nice. And those birds also cast silence wich is nice for killing mobs that heal or gate :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am one of those that is doing aa's before leveling because if gives me more places to hunt and i enjoy the older zones -- level 59 druid with almost 60 aas.<br />
<br />
I mistakenly took the advice of what seemed the consensus of threads I read that said dire charm was a 'parlor trick' and only marginally useful -- I guess in the higher level zones thats probably true.  However, I just bought dire charm and regret not getting it much earlier.  For example, in the grey which is currently a hot zone, I am getting 4 percent aaxp a kill at the sun revenants. Prior to getting dire charm, I could only root/rot 4 of the six before the first respawned.  But with one of the worms charmed and tanking, I can do all six -- that's 24 percent aaxp in 17 minutes in a very safe low risk camp (albeit a bit boring after a while).<br />
<br />
Conclusion?  Think out of the box when it comes to dire charm and you may find it is more useful than you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-PoP era exp mobs hit for maybe 150ish max, once pop came out they were hitting for 300s to start with, and quickly 600, even 900, and over 1000 once you got to elementals;  these are exp mobs, not bosses.  Then come GoD, everything runs like a cheetah on crystal meth, procs massive pain and death, and almost nothing is low enough to DC.</div></div><hr />

I didn't think mobs really had a say in the matter with DC. Either they were DC-able or they were not. So what does point c) have to do with anything?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">09-06-2005, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dire Charm only works on mobs up to level ?46?  They stopped putting wimpy level 46 mobs in the zones after PoP to try and limit the DC use.  They went through a while back and changed the way many GoD/OoW/DoN charmed mobs worked.  I remember back when GoD and OoW were still new that a Vxed or Tipt run would rely on a chanter charmed pet to do most of the dps for the group.  If you snare, charm, haste a pet that was equivalent to say a mob in MPG, then it would be able to quite easily rip through the zone.<br />
 <br />
DC was an AA from the original sets given out.  I did not get it when I was leveling up and as mentioned, now that I am level 70 I do not forsee me getting it for quite a while because it does not have as much use in the content I constantly encounter.<br />
 <br />
It really depends on your style of play and level and why you play.</div></div><hr />
