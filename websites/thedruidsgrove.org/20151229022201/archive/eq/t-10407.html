It cannot be used to activate any skills like forage or fishing, and is only currently on Test.</div></div><hr />

If your talkin about the Program from the rangers boards yes, it can be modified for foraging.<br />
 <br />
WARNING: On Xegony you can be banned for this, or at least suspended.<br />
 <br />
The autofire from hunters.com (Rangers board) is a client only program, meaning that it runs solely on your computer.  This means that it will be very difficult for a GM to &quot;catch&quot; you using it since all it does is flood your input stream with a command, (only on your computer).  They (GM Admins) CAN see what is in your inventory and even trace how often a server side skill is used.  By Macroing forage / fishing you are sending a request to the loot(s) server and consulting the loot table for that zone.</div></div><hr />

Unless you use a gamepad, Macroquest, or the Hunter Autofire, then you will not be able to boost forage.</div></div><hr />

I believe the official word on gamepads is as long as you are at your keyboard it is fine. They did once try to put a ban on using gamepads, but there was too much backlash from people who use the gamepads more from necessity than just desire.</div></div><hr />
