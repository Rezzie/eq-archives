It shows a command center, which they've faked up somehow.</div></div><hr />

Every photographer today uses Photoshop, whether to do simple things like adjusting levels and cleaning up the image or replacing backgrounds, people, or items.<br />
<br />
Sometimes they get into trouble for it -- for example, a year ago on one of its web sites Microsoft took out that black guy (one is always there for political correctness purposes) and replaced him with a white guy for their site in Poland, where they apparently don't care about political correctness.<br />
<br />
But since virtually all marketing photographs are &quot;faked&quot; it's not surprising that BP would do it too.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that they hired such an amateur, since the average 12 year old kid playing on his computer can do a better job.  Seriously, just click the wand tool and you'll get a better selection automatically.</div></div><hr />

I'm just telling you, this is common practice in marketing.<br />
<br />
The stuff you see in the picture is rarely the same stuff that's on the raw camera data.  The stuff you see pictured may even be something else designed to look like what's pictured (food ads are a great example).<br />
<br />
This is even becoming alarmingly common in news media, where at least they pretend to tell the truth.  Remember those pictures where they added the extra missiles, or smoke, or whatever it was?</div></div><hr />
