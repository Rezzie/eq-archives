<br />
I don't know what you're build is so far, but I would focus on getting to feline swiftness and Sharpened Claws.  I would go Ferocity first, then max brutal impact and 3 points in Feral Instinct.  It's much easier for me to sneak up on mobs for the ravage now that I have the improved stealth that Feral Instinct gives.  <br />
Now you have Access to Sharpened claws, Feline swiftness and feral charge, all 3 awesome talents.  For Pvp, I would max them all.  If you play on a PvE server, you probably wont need feral charge.  From there its blood frenzy and predatory strikes, then faerie fire and whatever else you want up to HotW, which is awesome.  I don't know if LotP also buffs your crit% or if its just the group you're in, so can't tell ya about that.  That's the build I am using for my druid, mainly focused on cat form, but I am in no way a druid expert.  Just my 2c.  Hope it helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
first 5 points were easy to spend but the 2nd 5 i couldnt really think of anything that felt worth it at the level im at</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrigar</div><div class="date">12-27-2005, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO Brutal Impact is still worth it, but its mainly for pvp reasons.  I too am a big fan of cat form, but there are times when you pull an add, so you go to bear form and by the time the first one is dead, you may need to heal and the extra second you have after bash to get the heal off helps.  but it's not required in any way, so you may want to put all 5 points in feral instinct.  It is a great talent, affecting both cat and bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-28-2005, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brutal impact is definitley worth it the more you progress.  Even though you may just want to focus on cat, which is understandable, do not neglect bear form.  I love running in cat - almost all my feral gear is +agi +str, and I have just started seeing 1.2k plus crits, which is great fun.  However, as a druid, our bread and butter is bear.  <br />
<br />
When you start running instances and fighting elite mobs that dont go down so quick, cat form for the whole fight just wont cut it.  If you are in the position of soloing a same level elite mob with tons of armor and hp, cat is good for the quick dps, but eventually you will have to heal.  You have two options here:  Switch to bear, bash, heal, mf then back to cat to finish it off, or put points into natures focus so that you have a relativley uninterrupted heal (which I would recommend.  After furor in resto, this is a must have talent imo).  This is especially necessary when fighting mobs with high attack speed.  And the benefits of the extra second of stun in pvp are pretty obvious.  I have 3/5 in feral instinct, which allows me to prowl fine and hold aggro well.  I may eventually finish this talent, but 3/5 is fine imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xbjim</div><div class="date">12-29-2005, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the replies guys, another question on feral instinct.. the tooltip says it increases bear by % but doesnt say anything about the cat reduction, theres no % or will be greater the more points you put into it.<br />
<br />
is it like rogue MOD where each point 1 like being 1 level above yourself (i think thats what it does) or could i just put 1 point in there and get the full benifet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-29-2005, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats another reason that I didn't max out the talent.  I like the +9% threat that I get as a bear, but have no idea how much better the stealth is.  I rarely, if ever, get detected when in stealth.  <br />
<br />
Based on the fact that the bear threat scales, I would assume that the stealth scales as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrigar</div><div class="date">01-02-2006, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I understand it is, each level your stealth is improved by this talent, it's basically like you were 1 lvl higher.<br />
For example, if you didn't have the talents invested and were lvl 25 trying to sneak around a lvl 25 mob, it would be equal to sneaking around a lvl 30 mob with all 5 talents.<br />
Or for pvp reasons, it makes it much easier for you to sneak up on a higher lvl person for a ravage without them seeing you.</div></div><hr />
