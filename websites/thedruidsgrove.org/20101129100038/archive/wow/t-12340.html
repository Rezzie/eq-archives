<br />
Just started healing in Arena, and I have no arena gear.  I am healing in my Kara set right now.  Which gear should I aim for first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you have already started arenas, I would strongly recommend that you go straight for 4 piece season 3.<br />
<br />
That will account for the following slots:<br />
Hat<br />
Gloves<br />
Legs<br />
Chest<br />
<br />
You can also get a large amount of good pvp healing gear from normal pvp.  This trinket (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28235) is particularly important to get - bind it to a key that will be easy to press quickly, to get you out of a stun or fear.  This can be an absolute lifesaver, and is easily more important for pvp than any other trinket could be.  The 20 resilience will help as well :&gt;<br />
<br />
Fill up your other slots with pvp gear from normal battlegrounds while you wait for the arena points to start flooding in.  The first piece you will be able to afford is the gloves I believe.<br />

<br />
I'm not 100% positive on the exact stat values on all the gear pieces but I can assure you that S3 Kodohide (Healing) gear has substantially greater +healing and stam than the previous season's sets. <br />
<br />
Definitely work towards your PvP pieces (Neck, Bracers, Belt, Boots, Rings (both current season and previous seasons) and of course the PvP trinket (2min CD one)).<br />
<br />
As for gear, I'd recommend going for pieces that give the most resilience and stam upgrades first as those 2 stats are what really separate (in my mind) a PvE healer and a PvP one.<br />
<br />
Good luck and happy arena'ing</div></div><hr />

<br />
if u want to be good in arena u will need the pvp items.<br />
<br />
for the S3 items just get them through arena.<br />
the more annoying part are the non-set items (feet, belt, bracer, neck, rings, trinkets).<br />
u will have to do a ****-load of BG's to get them.<br />
u will need about 110k honor for all the non-set items.<br />
and this is REALLY much to farm^^<br />
especially if you are an active raider like me.<br />
it takes sooo much time.<br />
<br />
but it will be worth it for the arena. trust me.<br />
with my normal healing gear i survive about 1 min max vs 2 hitting on me.<br />
in my gear right now i can survive about 5 mins if i want to. (except vs 2 rogues and permastun^^)<br />
<br />
what arena are u playing? 2vs2, 3vs, 5vs5??</div></div><hr />

1. Are u really in a 2vs2 team with a holy pala? why? ^^ (best 2vs2 combo = druid/warri)<br />
<br />
2. <br />
If u are serious about arena-PvP then you should change your spec to a more valueable one.<br />
<br />
if especially in 2on2 your spec can change the outcome of a fight completely.<br />
<br />
i think u want to PvE and PvP at the same time.<br />
had the same problem. so i messed around and tried to get a spec which u can use in both.(cause i didnt want to effort the money of respecing all the time for pvp/pve)<br />
<br />
Take a look at my char &quot;Druidserg&quot; (link is in SIG) and think about the spec.<br />
<br />
i took all the things out of the resto-tree which push HT cause u never need those in raid-healing.<br />
i heal 25er np with my spec and if u have to cast a HT then its the instant one. <br />
and the aggro-reduce on tranquility...well... when u have to use that spell, aggro playes no role cause u never use it at the beginning of a fight; so its wasted points.<br />
<br />
your strengh in arena lies in CC.<br />
so in my spec i maxed out the possibilities.<br />
<br />
imagine the scenario in a 2vs2:<br />
u can take out a healer for about 15-20 sec from the fight.<br />
how??<br />
cyclone (6sec)-&gt; cyclone(3sec)-&gt; cyclone(1,5sec) -&gt; when he starts casting &quot;feral charge&quot; (2sec)-&gt; bash(4sec) -&gt; kittieform;1 claw; when starts casting &quot;maim&quot;(2sec) -&gt; cyclone -&gt; feral charge ..........<br />
<br />
and have time for HoTs in between.<br />
<br />
omg, so much writing. i could loose myself in such a thread! :D <br />
<br />
hope this helps u!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I had no plans on running arena at all.  I joined the team to sub for somebody one night, and now I'm a team regular.  I rather enjoy it.<br />
<br />
S3Rgio, I will check out that spec.  When I went Resto, I simply threw everything I had into that tree...not even considering PvP at the time.  Being a new healer, I simply wanted ALL that the Resto tree could give me.<br />
<br />
I've been slowly but surely accumulating my arena points.  So I can begin shopping soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the Insect Swarm/Resto combo, but I'm concerned about losing my ToL.  I've never healed without it.  <br />
<br />
Whereas PvP comes second to my raid healing, I think I'll stick with 8/11/42.  Looking forward to it actually.  <br />
<br />
I'll let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />
