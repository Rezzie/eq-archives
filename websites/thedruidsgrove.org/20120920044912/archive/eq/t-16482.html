I do alright on the gators in LP lately, and can clear most of the beach before I need to med (9.3kish unbuffed mana), but there are a decent number of immediate charm breaks still.  Is this worth trying to get a group together for?</div></div><hr />

Supposedly the gators there drop it (according to Alla's at least), hopefully I'll manage to get one.  I'm looking to get probably another hundred AAs at least before I level to 77, so I should have a decent shot at it :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found it to be the same when charming Icefall mammoths with the last charm - the rank II was much better.</div></div><hr />

Wow...it's like night and day, seriously.  I managed to pick up 6AAs on a lesson burn just now, and never dropped below 74 mana, from far far fewer charm breaks.  Probably 25% the breaks as rank 1.</div></div><hr />

Is there any other place to get this spell rkII or is it just bad RNG?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can say that mr debuff makes a huge diff.  When I box my 66 chanter, and tash the gators ( -45mr vs -20mr from glamour of tunare ), then my charms very rarely break, and i can clear 2/3 of the beach at 90 mana continuously ( I do have VoQ, Ironwood rk2, and shadowcat as my only mana regen buffs ).<br />
<br />
I am eager to get an additional -15mr off this new spell, it should help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am curious, how do you box with your 66 enchanter at the crocs? Where do you position him? Bears, frogs, and gators are KOS to anyone but druid/rangers there afaik. Maybe near the sea shore?<br />
<br />
When I PL a friends character I usually just invis them and do my thing. If I could utilize them it would sure be nice...</div></div><hr />

Or maybe one of the illusions like scaled wolf will allow them non-agro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annabella</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alliance / Collaboration (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1687&amp;source=Live) is a wonderful thing.  I used it a few times on my bard in TBS so as to not get random snake/basilisk/etc. aggro in the middle of a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fuinniuil</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I put soe and air elemental illusion ( its a very long lasting lev, essentially ), park the chanter off over the water,  and i also use collaboration.  Collaboration gets my chanter from threateningly to dubious with the gators. <br />
I pull a croc with entrap2, my chanter darts in and tashes, then darts out back to the water, and my druid does the rest.  sometimes if my chanter pulls aggro from tash, I autorun her out over the water, and have my druid sit, when the chanter is far enough away, which happens fast since she has soe and mob is always snared, then gator comes back to my druid.  <br />
<br />
Just keep all non druids away from the green grass where the frogs and bears path, and all is good.</div></div><hr />
