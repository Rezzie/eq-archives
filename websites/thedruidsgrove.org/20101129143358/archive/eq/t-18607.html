Newsweek: Extreme Motherhood (http://www.newsweek.com/id/189763/page/1)<br />
Understanding Quiverfull, the antifeminist, conservative Christian movement that motivates popular reality-TV families like the Duggars.<br />

If there is a wholesome counterpoint to the gossip-rich travails of single-mom Nadya Suleman and her 14 children, it might be Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who had their 18th child just weeks before the arrival of Suleman's octuplets in January. The Duggar birth was televised on the Arkansas couple's popular TLC reality show, &quot;17 Kids and Counting&quot; (now &quot;18 Kids and Counting&quot;). Unlike Suleman, who was vilified as the freakish, government-assistance-dependent &quot;Octomom,&quot; the Duggars' abundant progeny often attract admiration. Their children play violin, their palatial home is immaculate and the family matriarch is a soft-spoken multitasker who gently keeps order in her immense household.<br />

Ordinarily, I would not care one way or another, but, the womens' sufferage part kinda got me allittle bit. Here is an old ideology, let us start trading women for 3 oxen again, if, she is a good working woman with good birthing hips. No offense and all that, but, I believe births at hospitals are around $20k a pop nowadays........<br />
<br />
Honestly though, she maybe thinking twice in a few years when her uterus drops out, which is quite common among women in later stages of life, particularly those with excessive amounts of children(usually 4 is more than suffienct, although it is rare at 2 children). What happens from my understanding is the abdomenal wall gets weakened which helps keep certain organs in place.</div></div><hr />

The birth (assuming it's not abnormal) is just the tip of the iceberg that the taxpayers have to subsidize.<br />
<br />
We (primarily the rich taxpayers of San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, and the like) pay a small fortune per child in the hope that the investment will pay off when they mature.<br />
<br />
In the case of Arkansas, our investment appears about as valuable right now as GM stock.</div></div><hr />

You should try to get your punishments straight Tudamorf,<br />
<br />
For being photographed in a tee shirt she gets flogged (after spending an undetermined amount of time in a police cell possibly to be gangraped if the cops feel like it).<br />
AFTER that she gets stoned for being alone with a male unsupervised by her owner. And she is lucky to live in a civilised country because here at least it does take more than the word of somebody who 'thinks he has seen her alone with a male'. Instead proof is required before the stoning to death can commence (or the testimony of four men I suppose since that trumps everything, including evidence to the contrary).<br />
