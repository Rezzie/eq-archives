 <br />
My wife's tauren druid is level 7 at the moment. We always have double XP going since we don't play very often. I loaded her yesterday to see if I could catch up the 20% XP or so to be even with my warrior at level 8.<br />
 <br />
The thing is... I couldn't solo anything near bloodhoof village. Level 7 and 8 mobs tore the holy crap out of me. I would pull with the DoT, then cast DD and auto attack. I would even warstomp then heal myself, but always died. I said screw it and logged off. What am I doing wrong?</div></div><hr />

Do you cast Mark of the Wild before fights? Do you fully heal up before the next pull? ... we can go on and on. Please give a bit more info but I would suggest to grind to level 8 (get help if you have to) and get entangling roots. The rest is easy root mob cast spell rinse and repeat.At level 60 im a feral druid and still use that combo to hunt devilsaur.</div></div><hr />

I think I tried to keep the distance at those levels: Wrath/Starfire -&gt; Entangling Roots -&gt; Wrath/Starfire again -&gt; Moonfire and then finish off in melee. Pretty stable and safe, but costsome in mana; as often as I could (depended on opponent), I skipped the 2nd Wrath/Starfire in order to keep up the pace.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">12-14-2006, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, my warrior can kill those things no problem. I was just like WTF??? Do low level druids just suck that much?<br />
 <br />
I just wanted to solo a few mobs to catch up on XP. I'm OCD like that, want to have our XP relatively equal.<br />
 <br />
For pulling, yes I keep MotW on at all times. Armor does suck tho, you don't get much this early in the game. And I am always FH/FM before pulls.<br />
 <br />
My main for playing solo is a 21 troll rogue. That dude can tear the crap out of mobs 2-3 levels above him. It just struck me as odd that the druid couldn't hold her own.<br />
 <br />
My wife and I play as a team. Tauren druid and warrior. I am liking that combo so far. But since I do most of the killing, it seems the warrior gets just a bit more XP. Hence why her druid was behind.</div></div><hr />

Took me a bit to change my way of thinking, but now I am killing relatively easy.<br />
 <br />
Wrath, wrath, moonfire, autoattack.... Weird how just tweaking your play style can change the whole outcome of a fight. I am really liking how to play the different characters in WoW.</div></div><hr />

ya my druid is lvl 28 now and i try that in ashenvale and i almost keep dieing.. i have to go into cat form and sprint out so i dont get killed.... what am i doing wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tobeka</div><div class="date">01-05-2007, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 28 you shouldn't have much of a hard time soloing in Ashenvale.  If I were you, I would spend the majority of your time in Cat form.  I only switch out of cat form when I need to heal or when I need to pull with moon fire.<br />
<br />
You should be able to rip through the mobs in cat form. <br />
<br />
Another thing I like about staying in cat form when I solo is I can quickly stealth if I see a Horde coming my way, and then get the jump on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiskrens</div><div class="date">01-05-2007, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, maybe I should have added that the tacts I mentioned were for really low-levels: as soon as I got bear form I used Wrath-&gt;Moonfire-&gt;Bear to speed things up/increase survivability. Replace with Cat form when you get that, only after getting Ravage I think its worth staying in Cat most of the time.<br />
<br />
And some mobs (high armor/damage) are worth using Bear form all the time on, so you don't have to shift all the time for healing.</div></div><hr />
