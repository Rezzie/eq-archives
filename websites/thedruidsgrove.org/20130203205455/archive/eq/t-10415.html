Th erest would be one groupable. <br />

Is this true, or were they crazy?</div></div><hr />

I did my epic at 60. The parts where I needed help is are the dark elf event in east karana, Venril Sathir, Faydedar, corrupted cyclops and Ulump. <br />
<br />
I doubt most of Epic 1.5 or 2.0 can be soloed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firemynd</div><div class="date">12-13-2004, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which epic .. 1.0 or 1.5? Almost all of the 1.0 can be soloed by a 63 driud. Grab a tank partner for dark elves in EK and black reaver in CoM, and a single group of 65+ folks for Faydedar (or less than a group, really just depends on their gear and classes).  <br />
<br />
For the 1.5 druid epic, you have to be at least 65th level to equip the final item. As for the mobs themselves, at least six of the encounters would be practically impossible for a 63rd level (of any class) to solo. At minimum I'd suggest a tank partner for ulthork raider in EW, swamp terror in Feerrott, piranhas in CT .. and tank+slower for the NPCs in Harbingers and the ritual conduit / juggernaut in Natimbi. You'll need at least a few well-equipped groups for earthshaker in RCoD and the final fights (blackened treant, branches, and blackened dryad) in Kith.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the speak/hail NPCs will respond to a pre-65 with the proper quest dialogue for the 1.5... maybe someone else here knows.<br />

<br />
I have never had or started an epic for any of my characters. I am thinking that I should go ahead and give it a try. <br />

Thanks all.</div></div><hr />

As mentioned, EK, VS, Fay, and Ulump you will probably need more then just you to kill.</div></div><hr />

At 63 you and a 61+ tank should be enough to complete any of the events.</div></div><hr />

Uulump too, he just has so many HP.  Buying a Jade Reaver (I did, 9k at the time) will make soloing it a lot easier.<br />
<br />
I did my epic at 52.  I duo'd Uulump with one of the best 60 Paladin's of the time, and then got a cleric and some wizards for the dark elves.  I dropped like a sack of bricks against the inkies :P  But it was fun.  I needed 8 - 10 people or so for Faydedar at the time.  Back when you didn't have 15k+ tanks.  I miss that :P</div></div><hr />

I'm probably going to make a go at Fay with more dps and a cleric.  I'm thinking I should be able to grab a rogue x2, wiz, cleric and Fay will drop np.</div></div><hr />

with that group, he will most likely drop like a rock.  Get your resists up, and good luck :)</div></div><hr />

We grabbed a 67 paladin (elemental equiped) to tank. The druid triggered Fay, and then both druids stood around and looked cute while the paladin stomped Fay.  The paladin was never low enough health for us to cast a heal. Fight lasted less than a minute.  Don't spend too much time trying to get lots of healing and high DPS for this fight.</div></div><hr />

You on MT? :)<br />

Can I kill VS without help? It does not seem as if I would be able to. I have only fought him once, and that was about 3 years ago or so. It took a bunch of us back then.</div></div><hr />

Live VS? No, don't waste your time.<br />
VSR? Maybe, but unless you are bored, get a necro or paladin (VSR is undead) to help you.</div></div><hr />

I did try the live VS last week, and yep Cedre is right, a waste of time.  I tanked, healed, and dotted for about 6 minutes.  I ran out of mana before he did.  /blarg</div></div><hr />

So you were able to solo Ulump (sp)?<br />
<br />
Do you have any strats or ideas for taking him out? <br />
Is there anything worth using DC on to help? <br />
<br />
Thanks everyone. <br />
<br />
I have VS, Ulump, Fay, &amp; corrupted gorilla left. <br />
<br />
I hope to have it finished soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since your lvl 60, I assume your not prolly high end geared or have many friends who are, so heres my best recommendations to your needs-<br />
 <br />
Ulump is cake, just that hes 100% resistant to magic.  He has the hp of a PoS mob and less dps.  You should be able to take him with a tank and a melee dps (2 melee dps preferibally.)<br />
 <br />
 <br />
For VS, bring a tank, cleric, a dps class (or more), and a slower.  Even when I did it , with mostly people wielding epic 1's =p, i was able to do it with a enc / ranger / war / rog.  I believe VS no longer LT's , or runes wont stop, tho i cant confirm.<br />
 <br />
Fay is a very overhyped mob, imo.  Hes not very hard at all, bring a similar Setup as i recommended for VS and you should have it.  Just keep in mind you have to be within melee range to land spells, and fay casts an AEdispell.<br />
 <br />
Corrupted gorilla spawns from a certain PH in a corner of the zone, i believe its NW corner - was an easy camp for me once i found the right PH.  Perhaps if you ask your server boardsfor a MQ you could get one.</div></div><hr />

VS does not run oom, its a proc not a spell that uses mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagrin</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kam, thanks for that advice. I was in the wrong place for awhile for the gorillas. I figured it out when I could no longer find any. I had the dead tainted spawn twice. That really stunk. <br />
I am very surprised that I can stand in and take shots from these guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tagrin</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question about the resists needed for Fay. I know I need to get my magic and fire resists up there. With self buffs, I am at 181 Fire, and 196 Fire. SHould I try to get those over 200? I think I can easily go over 200 for a few thousand plat. I do give up some stats, but would rather resist than to have better stats. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Remember this is an old world mob we are talking about. 100+ resists were already considered rather 'insane&quot; back then.</div></div><hr />
