<br />
Here are the two and only ones viable for tanking as a druid<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Defender (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29186)<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Gladiator (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29193)<br />
<br />
I've been using the defense/dodge one for a while, but just hit revered with SSO and can now get the stamina/resilence one.<br />
<br />
I know that the resilence will make up for lost defense of the other for crit immunity, so I guess my question comes down to, whats better... the extra stamina or dodge?<br />
<br />
Ive heard people say &quot;Oh, Stamina, got to survive longer and need more in higher raids&quot;<br />
<br />
and Ive heard people say &quot;Oh, dodge, its your only mitigation&quot; <br />
<br />
My dodge is currently at 32.00% and HP with only Mark of the Wild on is 14883. I am logged out in bear form, with tank gear on, but WoWArmory isnt the best for accuracy, they tend to over do it on the stats.<br />
<br />
If I lose the dodge, I'll get it back with other peices of gear that I upgrade, for example, at the end of this week I will be getting Belt of Natural Power (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30042). Currently my guild is in Karazhan, cleared, and working on Gruuls.</div></div><hr />

The sta would be nice, but once you get above 16K health self-buff'd in bear form, you don't any more sta.  Once you do, you gear will come with more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">09-05-2008, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd also stay with the defender one.  You've got plenty of stam at the moment so I wouldn't worry too much about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-07-2008, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your stats are pretty balanced at the moment already.  I don't see any particular need to spend more money to buy a new head enchant.<br />
<br />
Ive heard people say &quot;Oh, Stamina, got to survive longer and need more in higher raids&quot;<br />
<br />
and Ive heard people say &quot;Oh, dodge, its your only mitigation&quot; <br />
<br />
To take each point in turn.<br />
<br />
1.  You do need stamina for raids.  However, many things contribute to the equation of &quot;how much damage does it take to kill me&quot;.  Stamina is only one of them; for physical damage you also have to factor in armor, and for spells your resistances come into play.<br />
<br />
A bear druid who only stacks stamina will end up with more health than another druid who goes for a more balanced approach.  However, they will be a lot squishier without an appropriate level of defense skill/resilience, dodge, and armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  This is just plain incorrect, bear druids also rely heavily on armor for mitigation.  Dodge is great but there's no point in dodging 9 blows and then getting 1-shotted by the 10th.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best approach is to go with a balanced mix of tanking stats.  Use your own judgement or ask questions here to get a feel for that balance.<br />
