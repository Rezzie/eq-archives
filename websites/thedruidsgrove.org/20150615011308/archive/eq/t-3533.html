<br />
I am not sure if anything was posted before - about PKT, anyways here are my 2 copper.<br />
<br />
This one is looted off Bilge Farfathom in Dagnor's Cauldron. Some people say he spawns once a week, or every 10 hours...<br />
some people say - he spawns randomly.<br />
<br />
I spent about 4 hours in Dagnor's Cauldron tracking him - no luck. So I binded myself there and just went back to DL to hunt. Every 2nd kill I gated to see if Bilge is up. He wasn't. SO i finaly got bored and begin to kill goblins. Since Bilge is a shaman I killed almost all shamans in the zone (looted 3 bone totems).<br />
After a while Dwigus Lowater pop on track... Killed Dwigus, waited, killed couple of skellys in the water... waited ... in about 1 hour I had Bilge on track (was wondering by Orc's camp)<br />
<br />
Now taking Bilge down is pretty easy if you are 44. Rooted, Dotted, Celefecation, Firestricked ... dead.<br />
For a lvl 30 shammy Bilge is INCREDIBLY stupid. All he done - was shooting me from his hunting bow and giving me about 10-15 damage ... Only once he attempted Tainted Breath and only once he tried to heal himself. <br />

I spent forever trying to get him pre kunark but to no avail.  I honestly feel you could improve your gear better spending time elsewhere.  IMO cauldron is possibly one of the most useless zones in EQ.</div></div><hr />

Over the period of 12 hours no Bilge, Dwygus however spawns about every 2-3 hours...<br />
<br />
Better idea - do a guild watch. Schedule a small watch raid for DC like:<br />
 Druid buddy 1pm-3pm<br />
 Ranger Buddy 3pm-5pm<br />
 Another Ranger buddy 5pm-6pm<br />
 Another Druid buddy 6pm-8pm<br />
 Yourself                 8pm-12am<br />
 Druid buddy            12am-2am<br />
 etc.<br />
 <br />
It looks good in theory - will try to do it in game. +18WIS is too good to miss...</div></div><hr />

Do you really want to hold an item with -9 str and no AC?<br />
<br />
The PKT is crap as far as I'm concerned, and definitely not worth all the effort it takes to get one.<br />

seriously guys, life sucks without wisdom. I need this so much.</div></div><hr />

My suggestion would be, if there is blue stuff to hunt, go for it, just get XP while you check track.  If there is no good supply of blue mobs, just skip it and keep levelling.  When you get to the 50's, you can drag 2 groups of friends to WW and get the Kromzek captain for the Talisman of Benevolence quest.  7AC, 15WIS, 12MR/CR, and not too tough with 2 well balanced groups (in the 50s).<br />
<br />
For casters in EQ, level &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; gear, even gear with lots of WIS or mana.  The only exception is gear with clickies.  At 46, you could now use a Lumi staff.  THAT could help you level quickly =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavick</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought, but has anyone ever tried doing an AoE duo in this zone in order to get Bilge up?  Have you, the druid (assuming a level greater than 51), run around and hit every mob you can, and pull to a certain spot where your friendly enchanter is waiting.   The enchanter AOE stuns and you AOE nuke.  You could probably hunt very efficiently that way.<br />
<br />
Whether Bilge and the PKT are worth the effort only you can decide.</div></div><hr />

Have 248 wis nowdays but money is nice from the totems. Over the last year i've sold 3 of them. What i'd do is just run arround and epic dot each gobbie and keep on going. There is no goblin in the zone (well besides the named) that doesn't die from the dot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
once you're over 200wis, a CC shield (20ac 9wis 40mana) will only give you ~5 less total mana and you gain the 20 AC (more like 35 w/ max def)<br />
<br />
still people try and sell this for 10k+ when its a lame item</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so,then (mana wise) <br />
18 Wisdom &gt;&gt;&gt; 9Wisdom + 40 mana<br />

<br />
They did raise the cap, but at half the rate.<br />
<br />
So at level 60, 1 WIS = 6 mana for WIS over 200, compared to 1 WIS = 12 mana for WIS up to 200.<br />
<br />
So, assuming level 60, and assuming all WIS added by items is between 201 and 255 (in other words, equipping items doesn't put you over 255, unequipping doesn't put you below 201):<br />
<br />
18 WIS = 108 mana<br />
<br />
9 WIS + 40 mana = 94 mana<br />
<br />
The differnce at level 60 is 14 mana, less than that at lower levels (only 5 mana difference at level 50).  14 mana is pretty much meaningless, at higher levels, mana regen is MUCH more important than total mana.<br />

You are correct then.<br />
(and 14 mana IS meaningless :))<br />
<br />
And thanks for clearing that up :)<br />

Can clear a lot of greens that way.  I personally hunted for bilge off and on for months without ever seeing him once.  Then I said forget it and bought a reed belt.  A few days later I traded that and some plat for a mucilagenous girdle which I had never seen before then.  With the PKT being the rare drop, I am not sure I would waste the time.  Buy a high wis shield and bone handled scimitar or something.  If you cna, just hunt the grey for the time you will spend there, and you will eventually get the scimitar and maybe the bone braced shield as well...you will get some nice experience to boot. CC shield, paw of opolla, charred guardian shield, the +wis 1hb from the orc fort in EW with 6 or 8 wis, bone handled scimitar, etc can result in decent +wis bonus from your primary/secondary combo and you will find it more useful even if it is 10 or so less on wisdom.</div></div><hr />

Helm- Othmir fur cap will net you another 6 wis. <br />
Bracer- Chipped Bone Bracer will get you another 5 wis<br />
Sleeves- Nathsar vambraces or Withered Leather sleeves will get you another 4 or so<br />
Gloves- Coldain Skin for another six, I think</div></div><hr />
