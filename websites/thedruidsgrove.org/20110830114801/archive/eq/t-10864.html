<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doonerk</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey I quit EQ about 8 months ago, but I got sick of other games and decided dust off good old EQ. I have all expansions except for Dragons, my magelo is linked below.<br />

Im looking for some gear upgrades that I can SOLO for, because my guild is usually too busy to help worthless little me, :P and I have like no DKP so getting Vex Thal gear on raids is difficult for me to do.<br />
 <br />
I dont have money to spend, but I heard of getting some Ornate Leather stuff from Tactics if I solo boars, I just got flagged for Tactics so I wanna try that, is it harder than charming frogs? Any strats? Thanks much in advance.<br />
 <br />
P.S.<br />
 <br />
Ive had the MM LDON leggings for quite a while, any suggestions on 3 augs I should put in? I have 1000 ldon points available atm but I can get more.  I'd prefer to augment some mana regen or focus effects that I am missing, but any good aug suggestions will help, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veresz</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never saw leather ornate drop in tactics in many many hours of xp there. Tactics for soloing is to charm a diaku or decorous boar from inside the downstairs tunnel, haste it etc and then send it in. Its considerably weaker than the other mobs so is quite mana expensive on heals. Alternatively upstairs there is a room you can use to kite Diakus in (turn left at top of hall from zone in).<br />
<br />
As for gear, OOW is your friend....Nobles Causeway has decent soloable drops and the tier 1 quest armour is nice and easy to get (apart from raising faction which is a royal pain). As an idea, shield in my magelo is random from NC, range slot is from RCOD 1 grpable named if I remember rightly, my head slot and 1 bracer are examples of the quest armour (Greenvale).<br />
<br />
With DoN expansion, Ive seen a spell haste 5 aug that I think was 250 points or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doonerk</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for the tip, Im not sure if I can solo in NC due to constant PKing, but do you have any tips for where to go and what to do? like what mobs to kill and stuff, i've only been to NC once on a raid.<br />
 <br />
I'd like to try soloing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ornate patterns drop off of the named mobs in tactics, Bot and SolRo, or rarely from the sentries in SolRo.  All of these mobs can be single grouped.  Unlikely that you could solo any of them.  I agree with Veresz, OOW zones are your best upgrade path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doonerk</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i was soloing some Murk's in OOW, they drop anything i could upgrade with? I really cant get a grp to come anywhere do to my play times, anywhere else i can solo for upgrades?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veresz</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think my shield drops off random in NC, so could get lucky with murks. There's also a quest for a cloak (see my back slot) with all 4 drops being from Murks (again faction is the hard part).<br />
<br />
Mobs in NC also rarely drop augment t/s items such as trean flies that all sell well (some parts fetch 50k depending on server), so don't get hasty with vendors on what looks like vendor trash, without checking Allakazam first.<br />
<br />
As a non raider, OOW was the best expansion for me :)<br />
<br />
I assume you are on Zek....which I am also (I play euro hours). So as long as you're not not kos to me..drop me a tell and I can help out (verex in game due to stupid soe naming rules on merge)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The zone rare drop for NC is http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30592<br />
any mob (including murkgliders) in the zone can drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doonerk</div><div class="date">02-25-2005, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for all the help guys, been root rotting in NC, it seems pretty empty on Zek as a plus.  I already got a wrist upgrade from some named thing that I duo'd with a necro so it's working out already.  Im in a Euro guild called Xanadu, so I dunno if you're KoS to them but ill look u up Vere, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">02-27-2005, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The murks in NC also drop 4 pieces for a quest cloak that would be a huge upgrade for you.  Its several pieces of a broken sword....you will have to get good facton with the dragorn loyalists but you need that for tier one armor as well.<br />
<br />
There is a rare zone wide belt that can drop from any mob in NC thats well worthwhile, and also a zone wide secondary item. Both are great druid items.  There is a third zone wide item, a melee cloak.  But two out of three isnt bad ; ).<br />
<br />
<br />
The named in NC often drop runes for 66-68 spells as well, they all summon but some arent too hard even so.  The easiest of the lot is the ukun packleader who spawns at the xroads camp near the center of the zone.  Running straight from DS to WOS you will pass a large gorge leading to your right, there is one roamer who spawns and paths through this girge...an ukun.  He will either be the name or a pher.  The name is the only thing here that will see invis.  If you can solo him he will drop all your 66-68 runes, a soso mask and an ok bracer.  He only melees and has no procs.  <br />

Been curious about it for quite some time, but couldnt find anyone who has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks exactly like the icon.  Same as a Shield of the Green Dragon.</div></div><hr />
