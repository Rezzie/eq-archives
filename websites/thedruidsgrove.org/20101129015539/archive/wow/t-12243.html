Does anyone know the song &quot;Chop Suey&quot; by System of a Down?  And if so, do you have any theories on what the song is about?<br />

<br />
This part is sung extremely fast, so much so that it's difficult to make out what the guy is saying:<br />
<br />

This part is sung slowly, with greater emphasis:<br />
<br />
I don't think you trust<br />
In my self righteous suicide<br />
I cry when angels deserve to die<br />
<br />
<br />
And the climactic ending to the song places the most emphasis on these lyrics:<br />
<br />
Father! Father! Father! Father!<br />
Father into your hands, I commend my spirit<br />
Father into your hands<br />
Why have you forsaken me<br />

I've come up with a number of theories, including self-abuse, domestic abuse, terrorism (from the perspective of the terrorist) and even suicide bombing.  I can't find one that fits with everything, though..<br />

A musical? Can't picture it in my head, personally. :whistle: <br />
Perhaps similar to the end of 'The life of Brian' by Monty Python?<br />
<br />
Anyhow... Biblical paraphrases according to my (faulty) memory, FWIW:<br />
During the scourging or crucifixion, said something along the lines of &quot;My Father, why have you forsaken me?&quot;<br />
And then at the moment of death, &quot;into your hands, I commend my spirit.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The next remark one of you will think to make is one about being weak minded or something like that.  Even Evolution requires faith,  no one alive today was there when it happened.  Where one places there faith is what defines who they are.</div></div><hr />

I am atheist, and although I do not agree with your views, I defend your right to believe them.<br />
<br />
Being religious in this day and age would be impossible for someone who is weak-minded, given the level of prejudice and general hostility towards religion.  A weak-minded person would follow the crowd.  Now without further ado, tell me what the damn song means :P<br />

When I was in school I hated lit/history class in which had to &quot;figure out&quot; what the author was saying.  Why the hell do authors do that?  Why not just say it outright?  So, just maybe, these authors are enlightened enough to write down what they mean.  Which in this case it is just babble?<br />
