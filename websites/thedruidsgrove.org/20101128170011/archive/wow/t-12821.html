I was wondering what yalls healing rotations were and what stats are good for t5 content. Im at 1503+ to heals buffed at the moment, and normally get on raid heals as the priests take care of our tanks.  <br />
<br />
thoughts? Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're not healing tanks then just pop a lifebloom or rejuvenation on each raid member that needs healing, make sure your bars are nice and big and easy to click on.  If someone is in danger of dying using NS or swiftmend on them, otherwise just rely on lifebloom to heal them for small amounts of damage and rejuvenation on larger amounts.<br />
<br />
You can't really get a regular rotation on raid healing due to the as-needed nature of it.<br />
