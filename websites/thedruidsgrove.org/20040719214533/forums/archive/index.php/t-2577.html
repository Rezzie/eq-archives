<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poitez</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will stack with most anything except other illusion buffs.  The only exception is avatar in all it's forms.  As long as your tanks don't mind being in wolf form it's nice spell to use compared to having your shaman casting Avatar as soon as it pops everytime.<br />
<br />
Complete List of things that will not stack with it: lucy.fnord.net/stacking.h...ource=Live (http://lucy.fnord.net/stacking.html?id=4058&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />

I dont know anyone who can stand the wolf attack animation.   Either remove the illusion or remove the attack animation for the wolf.   <br />
<br />
Also, whats the deal with it being only 30% movement?   Casters might actually want it if it was 40% movement like the ranger spell.   Why is it that the hybrid class gets a faster movement spell?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people with avatar have it because of ST weapons.  Basically, if you have ST weapons in the group, the druid buffs are useless.  If you don't, they probably still won't take wf cuz most meleeds don't like the change in perspective.  I also think they lose kick and slam, to whatever degree they still use them.</div></div><hr />

Spell: Primal Avatar does not, but the spell scroll itself is NO DROP and only drops inside sleepers tomb.<br />
Spell: Ferine Avatar is better than either of the other two (or the proc), and takes no emerald, but is a higher level spell (65? vs 60 for the other two) so the shaman may not have it.</div></div><hr />

Feral Pack adds atk... but does it stack with other classes' atk buffs?  In other words, is it worth it to buy? <br />
It won't stack with speed buffs (SoW, SoE, etc.), ranger ATK buffs, or illusions.  I don't see ranger ATK buffs in that Lucy listing but they definitely don't stack.  I'm not sure about Avatar but I haven't heard any complaints thus far.<br />
<br />
Feral Pack is a nice +ATK buff if a) your tanks don't mind the wolf animation/noise and b) you don't have ranger buffs.  It also adds Ultravision and See Invis, which is helpful for some.  The speed aspect of it is a total joke, however, as most everyone has Run Speed 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same deal with Shrew.  It's indoor run3 at a level when run3 isn't available.</div></div><hr />
