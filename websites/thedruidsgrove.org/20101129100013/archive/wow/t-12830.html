<br />
Right now i am around 500 healing or so and am probly sure that sucks :)<br />

<br />
500 healing is about half what you need to even think about stepping foot in Kara.<br />
<br />
For about 40 gold you can pick up a +227 healing mace on the AH, it's mentioned in other threads here and I naturally cannot think for the life of me what it's called, No other stats to sing about, but it will give you a decent boost until you can get a better drop.<br />
<br />
depending on where you are right now I'd go grind the instances. Either stick Feral and hit the heroics and start collecting healing gear or take the plunge and respec Resto and try the normals, 500 healing should be just enough to get started. http://www.wow-loot.com has a handy list of all the various bits of loot and the moonglade blue set from 5 man instances is a nice one to start out for the 2 set +35 dodge bonus that it gives your Rejuve.<br />
<br />
Don't ignore cloth gear just because it's cloth either, preistly healing gear is often just fine and dandy for Druids too.<br />
<br />
Look to stack +healing in the first instance (a green +120 healing cloth chest item drops in ramparts for example) and also look for +int and +spirit.  I don't tend to worry too much about Spell crit, rolling HoTs all the time makes it less important to Druid healing.<br />
<br />
In terms of helpful rep items there's a glyph from Honour Hold (need revered) that enchants your hat and the lower city prayerbook trinkets (again needs revered) area decent set to start with, you can kit two, but the use bonus doesn't stack and isn't that great to begin with.<br />
<br />
PvP resto (kodohide) gear is ok at a pinch to begin with if you're sat on a big pile of honour/tokens for purples or even the blue set from the quartermasters can be ok to give you a decent amount of +healing to get you going.<br />
<br />
In terms of mods etc everyone's got their own preferences, I like Lifebloomer for 5-10 man runs in conjuction with Mouseover macros that let you apply the heal without having to select the character in question.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, definitely bear (sorry) in mind that once you spec resto you no longer kill mobs so much as bore them to death especially if you persue Tree healing. While I don't regret going Tree resto for a second running Dailies, for example, will be a lot more of a chore than you're used to.</div></div><hr />

Given that I'm still grinding rep on mine I've opted for a 16/0/45 balance/Resto mix. I get all the benefits of Tree healing with some ability to squish mobs from Balance.  in short I've omitted all the talents from Resto that boost Healing Touch and Tranquility which I only ever use in emergencies (though the reduced threat from Traniquility has got me mulling over a slight tweak of the talents).  Gear wise I just stay in my healing kit and swap my healing mace for the Kara Balance casting Staff for that little bit extra Mana and Damage dishing.<br />
<br />
At a risk of preaching to the choir, Healing Touch drops you out of tree form so I only ever cast it linked to Nature's Swiftness to convert it to an instant cast in case of emergencies so spending talent points reducing its cast time aren't much use.<br />
<br />
[edit]  Just noticed that the impending patch is going to give everyone a free talent respec  so if you're looking to experiment a little now might be the chance to give it a go, two respecs for the price of one!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I regularly see :<br />
<br />
Gloves of the Living Touch<br />
Pants of Living Growth<br />
Hood of Primal Life<br />
<br />
on the AH or grind the mats and get someone to make them.<br />
<br />
also if you're a LW look out for any nice recipes going cheapish on the AH (including this way any items that are BoP). I picked up the one for Shoulderpads of Renewed Life (although they need Hearts of Darkness which are still not cheap on my server...)<br />
<br />
Get the appropriate spellthread on your legs - Golden/Mystic ?<br />
<br />
There is a nice +81 healing enchant for a weapon and a nice mace with +299 healing if u are exalted with the Sha'tar.<br />
<br />
The Shattered Sun Pendant is quite a nice item if you get to exatled with them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">09-15-2008, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad going for a week's work you want 1000+ healing to start considering Kara or Heroic runs, all things being equal.<br />
<br />
At the risk of stating the obvious when it comes to enchants, I tend not to bother on anything blue or lower. It's expensive for an item that I intend to replace very soon. Glyphs from the various faction QMs are a slightly different matter, 80-100g is relative easy to get nowadays, shards, primals and so on might be more expensive in time and/or gold to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-16-2008, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely disagree with needing 1000+healing for Kara.  That might be true for heroics though since they are very much spike damages... it can get pretty ugly for druid healing in heroics.  As a tree druid I got away with about 800+ healing and topped the healing charts in Kara over people who were over 1600+healing.  Tree druids have a bit more slack given the nature of their healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">09-16-2008, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience mirrors that of Allahanastar - 1000+heal is a good place to start for Kara, but with a good group, you can do well with a bit less.  IIRC I was sitting around 900 or so and it went fine.<br />
<br />
Heroics are different though - I'm still uncomfortable with all but the easiest heroics at 1300+heal.  It really depends on how well geared the rest of your party is - the better geared they are, the less +heal you need to perform well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">09-17-2008, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Group makeup obviously makes a big difference.  If you've got a well geared group and at least one other well geared (ie already kara+ equipped) healer then yes, you can get away with lesser +healing.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day I do think it's a reasonable benchmark figure to aim for especially if you're in a raid group that is all/mainly characters starting out in Kara.<br />
<br />
Heroics are different though - I'm still uncomfortable with all but the easiest heroics at 1300+heal. It really depends on how well geared the rest of your party is - the better geared they are, the less +heal you need to perform well.<br />
I'm tempted to revise the figure upwards as well, at 1600 healing now some of the later normal runs such as Magister's terrace still present problems let alone heroics.<br />
<br />
Again group makeup makes a huge difference on runs where there's significant AOE damage or you've got a heavy emphasis on Melee, especially where you've got party members using them to actively gear up rather than grind rep or collect badges.<br />
<br />
As a tree druid I got away with about 800+ healing and topped the healing charts in Kara over people who were over 1600+healing.<br />
Well healing charts are handy but I'd expect a Tree to top them over a better geared priest/pally if the Tree is covering Tank healing. You're rolling constant healing on the 2-3 party members taking constant damage while freeing up the others to give you cover/top you up and heal the raid.<br />
<br />
It's nice to sit there looking at recount and think &quot;wooo! I r uber healer because I spanked our much better geared priest off the healing meters&quot; (I know I did in a similar position) but it doesn't give you the whole picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-17-2008, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, but my point is that even at lower gear levels you can put out a huge amount of raw healing that the other classes can then fill in the blanks more easily.  At this close to the expansion I'd encourage anyone if they are close to give a shot at Kara before it goes the way of the dodo or becomes that retro run you slot into.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And just to be contrary I totally disagree with you about Kara, it's not one of the best instances Blizz have ever done by a country mile. So if you get a chance to run it and haven't before definitely don't scamper off to the bank, take your fish sticks and Healing elixirs out and get there Stat, because you won't enjoy it. :D</div></div><hr />

I gave up on that and went for pvp gear instead...then once I got Kara geared for healing the d3 stuff started dropping like candy...</div></div><hr />
