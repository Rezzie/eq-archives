 <br />
I solo more than anything else (just no time to raid and even groups take too long sometimes).  I am wondering which will help a soloing druid (Mainly VXED, Murks in NC) the most in racking up more AA points quickly...  I have Destructive Fury 2 and can get DF3 for 9 AA points.  I have Critical Affliction 1 and can get 2 for 6 AA points.  I will complete both eventually, but am wondering which will be most beneficial in soloing in the short term.  <br />
 <br />
Thanks for any shared experience on this!  <br />
Thanks!<br />

In NC sometimes you can pick off rares and sell them for plat which might help you get better gear. In Vxed you are alone and could be slightly more experience per. I can suggest other places, but it might be easier if you give us your hp/mana so we know what to suggest.<br />

Assuming you don't have fire flag?</div></div><hr />

I'm not flagged for Plane of Fire yet, so that's just an opinion of mine.<br />
<br />
If you are doing more root / dotting in Vxed, NC, or other places, then I would max out the Crittical Affliction line.  Personally I noticed a significant difference when I got CA2 (working on 3rd rank myself atm).<br />
<br />
I just leveled up to 68 with 129 AA atm.  I'm personally more excited since recently acquiring the lvl 67 spell Immolation of the Sun and lvl 68 spell Wasp Swarm.  The extra dot and higher damage is allowing me to kill mobs quicker.  Now I just have to find enough courage to zone into Vxed for the first time.  That or maybe try dotting the Murks in WoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinner</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks folks!  As for if I nuke of DoT more.. I do a combination of both, and am just wondering the two AA's compare.  It might be better to ask how Crit Affliction 3 compares to Destructive Fury 3 for a soloing druid who will nuke and DoT.  Not a big deal, since I plan to max out both eventually. <br />
 <br />
As for the nerve to do VXED... VXED has been a solo druids dream for me.<br />
XP is very good and I only die there if I don't pay attention.  You just have to be attentive and smart enough to zone when called for.  I have leveled in VXED almost entirely since lvl 66 or so.  <br />
 <br />
Thanks again all!<br />

When soloing, I always tend to lay down several dots and mix in some nukes here and there, so I tend to do more damage with dots (and use more mana). I saw a huge increase in DPS maxing out dot crits. Watching big (for us) nuke crits is cool and helps too, but you will get more bang for your buck going with the Critical Affliction line.</div></div><hr />

It's impressionistic, but well worth it I would say.  I root-rot alot and can't wait to max out the whole line!</div></div><hr />

I must say, it's very nice, since when I solo, it's usually root rotting with 5 DOTs.  I'm now up to ICA1, and the extra 12% crits on DoTs is very nice.  And since DoTs are more efficient that nukes to begin with, even better.  I also have AE4 and BA3, and with the whole package, my top DoT has a damage to mana ratio in the neighborhood of 10, which is awesome!<br />
