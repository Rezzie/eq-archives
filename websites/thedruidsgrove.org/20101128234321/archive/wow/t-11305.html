<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the nerf to Nurturing Instinct I had decided to include that in my build and go with a 0/42/19 build.  Now that it is 50% I'm debating going back to a sort of 0/41/20 build with Improved Regen in it.  Having just the 2 talent points to spend which would you get?  <br />
<br />
I use rejuv most of the time currently as a heal just to top people off being mostly feral in raids, but I'm thinking with the stacking of other HoT's a regrowth might better suit me at times or even a healing touch. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping to have around 350 str in the expansion so that would put me around +175 heal from NI.  The last rank of Rejuv does around 1060 healing.  So Improved Rejuv Rank 2  would give me +106.  Is my math correct in assuming I'd gain more out of NI across all healing including rejuv instead of just getting IR to help rejuv only?  <br />
<br />
I know blizzard had talked about upping how +Heal worked on HoT's for druids so that's where my confusion really starts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO, NI is only useful for Feral/Resto hybrid builds, and ONLY if you wear hybrid gear. Hybrid gear, as in the Genesis set, or anything that gives you str/int/+healing/+spelldmg, etc etc. Without that kinda gear, it might be better to skip NI, and drop those 2 points elsewhere in the feral tree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll probably be wearing T4 gear in BC and the rest arena set with a mix of hybrid type off spot pieces.  Currently I use the PvP set as it's the best all around gear I've found.  So knowing that would you still suggest no NI or Imp. Rejuv?  <br />
<br />
Although I spec deeply in feral I always considered myself a bit of a hybrid between dps, tanking, and back up healing.  I originally was 30/21 but decided to go more into the feral after PvPing alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if the math you did isn't quite accurate(although it should be) and you assume that the amount of healing you get from NI is equal to Imp Rejuv, then consider that NI is universal. It's going to apply to every heal you cast, whereas Imp Rejuv is only one spell.<br />
<br />
Based on the numbers you came up with, I'd take NI over Imp Rejuv 100% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE<br />
If I'm healing, I'll be wearing healing gear and probably won't have much strength. With my current healing set, it would be 2 talent points for ~+40 heal. Might be useful while leveling in feral gear. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
A lot of the new gear is designed for Feral/Resto and has quite a bit of +heal already. Useful until the new gear is acquired. May still be useful after that.<br />
<br />
I'll probably spec it for leveling to 70 and then see how much benefit it actually provides as I acquire the new gear from the Arena and 25 man instances.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">11-29-2006, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a while though it was passive and 100% , which made me drool over it :)  Passive and 50% is ok, but I don't know... <br />
<br />
In PvE I often wear my PvP set and a mix of hybrid gear.  This allows me to DPS fairly decent and still drop back and heal for a few minutes if someone dies.  I can generally reach the top 10 in DPS but usually not the top 3.  I'm fine with that.  Looking at the Tier 4 set though each piece seems to have 30-40 str.  That's 15-20 +heal with this talent.  Not great, but around what I'm used to from the PvP set.  I havn't seen the Arena set in a while for feral but I know for a while all the +heal was removed from it , is it back?  I think the rational was with NI and the +heal it was too powerful.  I must find the current set and see for myself now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartidiot</div><div class="date">11-29-2006, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So any chance that the +450% armor and +40% stamina in bear form will be given to us next week with the patch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, just because the arena set has +healing doesn't mean some more isn't worth it. With feral mana pools being what they are sometimes, I'll take all the +healing I can get. The estimate of 350 strength seems a very realistic one as well, +175 healing as a passive talent is nothing to sneeze at.</div></div><hr />

Well i tried my balance skill but they still did the same dmg as before (500 dmg) and gear cant make a differnce of 3.5 k dmg can it? <br />
So my question is what om doing wrong which talent i rlly should have to get my starfire atleast above 1 k dmg... :texla: <br />
<br />
Well i hope i get an answer and ty anyway <br />

<br />
...in PvP. The question is whether the +int and +heal already on the TBC gear is enough that your two points might be better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The only reason to take this for PvE (aside from leveling) is if you think you don't need to carry a separate set of healing gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">11-29-2006, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">was the video old or new? if it's old, they prolly used both the ephemeral power and zandalar charm to super charge their starfire dmg, for a massive attack. they prolly had a good amount of spelldmg too. if it's a new video from bc, u can do about 3.5k crit starfires with about 500-600spelldmg. hmm, not sure if u need to trinket to get that dmg tho.</div></div><hr />

Or a true hybrid type of druid that could dps and heal....which in itself might be imbalanced but it's something I've been trying to pull off since I started playing :)  I've never really found the need for +900 heal to be a back up healer, I run around with about +250 and it works just fine for me so around +400 with str and some +heal gear would be perfect for me :)</div></div><hr />

If I'm not the main healer and I have to shift out to heal, an extra +200 isn't going to amount to much, especially given the hp increases and downranking changes in TBC.<br />
<br />
The only time you are going to be backup healer in feral gear is if you already have a warrior and a priest but not a paladin or shaman. If the priest can't handle all the healing themself, and you need to pop out and heal someone once in a while, +400 heal on top of that HT11 might be worth 2 points. A +200 heal that is very situational just doesn't seem like a good use of those points.</div></div><hr />
