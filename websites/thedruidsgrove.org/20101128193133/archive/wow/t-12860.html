I come from a heavy rogue background (played a raiding rogue for the past 2 years).  I have one question.  Does the Agility Equivalence Points system work for feral druids? <br />
<br />
I am used to using the following point system as a rogue, does it still apply?<br />
<br />
AEP (PvE)<br />
<br />
Agility 1<br />
Stamina 0.5<br />
CritRating 1<br />
HitRating 1<br />
Ap 0.5<br />
Strength 0.5<br />
RedSocket 8<br />
YellowSocket 8<br />
BlueSocket 8<br />
<br />
<br />
AEP (PvP)<br />
<br />
Agility 1<br />
Stamina 1<br />
Resilience 1<br />
CritRating 1<br />
HitRating 1<br />
Ap 0.5<br />
Strength 0.5<br />
RedSocket 8<br />
YellowSocket 8<br />
BlueSocket 8 <br />
<br />
Will make for a easy transition for me if it does, if not let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
For druids its not exactly that.  I'm sure Annik will be along shortly with the equivalency numbers today, but in the expansion we'll want more rogue stats than we do today.  Today a lot of times we stack more strength to get a lot of AP.  Our base damage isn't that high so unlike Rogues who can up their damage by getting a higher DPS weapon we have to hit raw AP bonuses to up our DPS.<br />
<br />
There are two schools of thought here.  One is balance the stats and stack some decent Agility and Stength.  We'll get more AP point for point out of Strength than agility, but arguably we lose a decent amount of crit as well.  The second would involve stacking rogue gear for all of the extra Agility, but their AP would probably be a waste for us point for point... so its kind of a wash.  We'll get more crit and in some cases damage out of the higher AGI on rogue gear, but we won't necessarily have the extra stamina and strength and armor that the feral druid gear has.<br />
<br />
The good news is that our itemization closely aligns with rogues in the expansion so.. this may be an academic exercise at best right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's tricky when it comes to us ferals, because we need different stats for bear, cat, and pvp.<br />
I would be loathe to assign fixed values to the stats to be honest, because so much of druiding is dependent on being properly balanced.<br />
Simply put, for cat druids, agility tends to be the &quot;best&quot; stat, however stacking ONLY agility isn't a good idea.<br />
<br />
I made a list for another druid a while back of the different stats, and their rough order of importance for different things at different level/gear ranges.  Perhaps it will help :&gt;<br />

Now to learn the feral skills, I have been a heal bot till now, I need to try all those neat skills out.  <br />
<br />
One other follow-up question.<br />
<br />
General logistical forum rules question.  I am an old fart so forums are kinda foreign to me.  If I have a specific question and there is a related post on it that is old/inactive (i.e. the last post on it was a long time ago) is it ok to post in it with my related question and bring it back up from the depths of obscurity?  Or is it better to create a new post with my specific question?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, yus... forum necromancy is allowed :&gt;  Although most people would just post a new question, perhaps linking to the previous thread.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter too much on a relatively quiet and well-moderated forum like the druid's grove :&gt;  We are all pretty easy going around here..<br />

In the post you link to above you state, &quot;Enough Defense Rating and/or Resilience to reach the crit cap&quot; under bear at 70.  What is the crit cap?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-30-2008, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">415 is the defense cap right now... its completely not needed after the patch in a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
I think its like 2.5% or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-01-2008, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome Daz.<br />
<br />
415 assumes you have the appropriate feral talent.<br />
<br />
From memory you need 2.6% crit reduction from a combination of +defence and +resilience to be crit immume.<br />
<br />
But as Alla says its going to change when they roll out the next big patch ahead of Wrath....well again assuming you take the appropriate feral talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-01-2008, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Kheldar says, provided you have all 3 points in the Survival of the Fittest talent, you need a further 2.6% crit reduction to become uncrittable even by bosses.<br />
<br />
You can get that 2.6% from Defense Skill and Resilience.  Just mouse over these stats and look at the tooltip - it directly tells you how much percent your resilience (or defense) is currently doing.<br />
Just add the two numbers together - if they add up to more than 2.6%, you're sorted :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-01-2008, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would add that it is ridiculously easy to get crit capped with resilience.  103 resil and 0 defense on gear (so 350 def and 103 resil on your character tab) will get you crit capped.  Buy the blue rep gear (level 70 pvp epic in wowhead), total cost w/o gems or enchants &lt;100g, and you will be uncrittable with the Survival of the Fittest talent.  As mentioned above, when the new talents come out in the next patch, fully talented SotF will make us uncrittable with 0 resil and 0 def on gear.</div></div><hr />
