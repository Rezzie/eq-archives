Still on day 4 of the trial and at level 14. THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN!!!!! I'm literally levelling by doing quests and nothing more than quests, and it feels great! Now to find a way to break it to my wife I'm gonna buy the game and pay monthly to play ... Uh oh, I think I'll prefer to solo a level 60 Mob :P<br />
Aaaanyway, I just wanted to get reaquainted with TDG personnel and hope someone here remembers me from the EQ days. I unfortunately found out too late about the reactivation of all old EQ accounts (I read it ends in 9 days) so don't think I'll be returning there, or who knows... I've always had the urge, after more than 4 years away from the game, to run through my favorite zones and bash an orc or two ;)<br />
Still, I might be claiming victory too soon. Still have to get the &quot;OH OK!!!&quot; from my wife before getting WOW as she had such a hard time when I was hooked on EQ she vowed never to go through all that again!!!<br />
<br />
Will see how it goes. Stay tuned for updates... Or not :)<br />

<br />
WoW druiding is a great deal of fun :D  The progression through the levels I remember as being absolutely thrilling.  Getting things like cat form, and hurricane, for the first time..  was just so awesome :&gt;<br />
<br />
One tip for breaking the news to the wife..  you can take the angle that WoW is a lot more of a casual game that Everquest is/was.  That might help to persuade her that she isn't about to become a widow. =P  Although to be fair it does still take at least 30 minutes to do anything fun in WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do let us know how you get on :&gt;  With druiding, as well as news-breaking..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Araxx Darkroot</div><div class="date">07-16-2008, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Annikk, thx for the response. I've seen a lot of your posts. Been browsing to get a feel for the place again.<br />
One thing I've noticed is the different paths a druid can take in WOW, unlike EQ until the AA points came into effect, and one could become a Damage Dealer or a Healer, unless you got all the AAs and became both :P In WOW I see three different career paths - Feral, Reno and Balance - (correct me if I'm wrong) but I'm not sure right now how my decisions at this point will play out further along the line. I'll have to become more of a soloing type of Druid due to me having to be on my toes at home with the Missus and 2 year old boy and most probably have about a 1 or 2 minute notice before having to shut down the game :P So, if anyone can give me a quick and general run through the Pros and Cons of each of these paths I'd be greatly thankful :)<br />
At the moment I've put a few points into Balance and a few into Feral (after discovering the tabs at the bottom of the Talents window!!). I generally root, wrath wrath moonfire then rejuvenate myself as the mob comes in for the melee, when I turn into a Bear and Tank it to death. Not sure whether this is a good technique but so far it's working and the only reasons I've died so far is due to adds or blundering into an area full of higher level critters... Not the place to start posting stories right now :P<br />
<br />
So, as I've said, any advice as to how my skills will play out at a later stage will be very welcome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">07-16-2008, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the routes a druid can take.<br />
<br />
You are mostly correct; feral, resto, and balance are all very distinct paths a budding druid can take.  However there is a 4th option - you can go as Hybrid.<br />
<br />
Hybrid druids are the rarest kind.  Rather than specialising in one talent tree, hybrid druids go for a bit of everything.<br />
Most druids feel that hybrid is a very challenging way to play, and that you miss out on a lot of the really cool talents by spreading your points out across the board.<br />
I do not know any genuine hybrid druids, either in game or on these forums.  However, they do exist :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The order you are casting spells and abilities during combat is fine.  It's a good idea to try lots of different ways of fighting, because that way you will get a good general overview of the druid class and it can help you to decide how you would like to specialise in the long run.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll try to give you a brief overview of what your game experience will be like with each of the different talent trees:<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral.<br />
You will spend most of your time in either cat or bear form.  These are really the defining things about feral druids, the forms.  Signature moves include Feral Charge, which is loads of fun.  Being feral feels very empowering - you can be really tough (as a bear) or do very good instant damage (as a cat), the speed and the inevitable RP'ing aspect of playing as an animal are some of my reasons for preferring Feral to the other trees.<br />
<br />
Feral druids are usually asked to tank or dps in most group situations.<br />
<br />
Putting all of your points into the feral tree is generally considered the fastest way to level up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Resto.<br />
<br />
Restoration Druids can turn into trees!  Tree druids move slowly, but have very powerful heals.  Restoration Druids are all about healing.  The big attraction of resto over other types of healers, such as paladins and priests, is that Resto druids are highly mobile - they can continue healing even while on the move.<br />
<br />
You can see this yourself from a spell you already have - Rejuvenation.  You can cast it on yourself or a friend, even while running.  Most (but not all) resto druid healing can be done on the move.<br />
<br />
Also the tree has a special dance - it does The Twist.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
Most groups will naturally assume a resto druid will be healing, as resto druids are relatively poor at fulfilling the other types of roles.<br />
<br />
If you enjoy healing, Resto is worth a shot.  However, Restoration is generally considered the worst tree for levelling up, so many druids respec* to Restoration once they have reached level 70.<br />
<br />
* coming from everquest, respeccing may be a new idea to you; basically it allows you to &quot;unlearn&quot; all the skills you have learned with your Talent Points, enabling you to put the points back in differently.  So respeccing could allow a resto druid to become a feral druid, for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance.<br />
<br />
This type of druid can turn into a strange looking creature called a Moonkin.  It's a big, fat, feathery affair and being in this form allows the druid to become a (far more) deadly spellcaster.<br />
<br />
You will find yourself nuking most enemies from far away, and if you are just questing they will quite frequently die before they even get to you.<br />
<br />
Moonkin druids are considered by the WoW population at large to be the least-useful type of druid for groups and raids (with the possible exception of hybrid druids).  However, if you do find yourself in a raid, the chances are high that you will be placed in a group with other spellcasters, as the Moonkin has an aura that has a beneficial effect on other casters in the same group.<br />
<br />
The coolest spell exclusively available to balance druids is, in my humble opinion, Force of Nature.  This summons 3 treants - walking trees like you saw in Lord of the Rings - to fight for the druid.  You can pick the spot they appear, allowing the Moonkin to instantly surround an enemy with treants without giving away their position.  Moonkins in pvp tend to be snipers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To summarise, lets look at the pros and cons of each:<br />
<br />
Feral Pros: Empowering, sought after for groups, capable of soloing very effectively, very fast movement speed<br />
Feral Cons: Can't heal all that well, and your ranged spells don't do much damage.<br />
<br />
Resto Pros: Sought after for groups, excellent at healing on the move, notoriously slippery and difficult to kill in pvp<br />
Resto Cons: Poor at soloing, tree form reduces movement speed, reliant on groups to achieve things at a decent pace<br />
<br />
Balance Pros: Good ranged damage, fun sniper-style pvp, feathery<br />
Balance Cons: Least-sought after type of druid for groups, poor survivability in pvp if spotted/chased<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So yea hopefully I have not biased you too much in any particular direction.  :&gt;  All of the talent trees are fun in their own way, and the usual advice given to new druids is to give them all a try.<br />
<br />

I'd forgotten about respeccing (did know about it though) so that puts my mind at ease with respect to the path I choose, as I can always change later depending on my style of play, which I can forsee now is going to be a bit of grouping but a lot of soloing. Sounds boring, especially playing a MMORPG, and I can't but agree, but that's the way it's gonna have to go. /shrug<br />
Right now I like the Tanking capabilities of my Bear so think I'm going to go a bit in that direction. I'll take a good hard long look at the trees and their skills because I might actually put a bit of everything, then you can say you KNOW a Hybrid :P<br />
<br />
THX again, and if anyone esle wants to offer some advice, as in interesting zones, mobs, quests, places to get some Gold, etc. Please don't refrain from posting :)<br />
<br />
Silly question: Does sitting accelerate mana regen like in EQ? Not seen it does, but then I might be wrong (as usual) :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">07-16-2008, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sitting doesn't inherently do anything to your mana regen in World of Warcraft.  However, not casting any spell for a period of 5 seconds allows you to start regenerating mana from your Spirit.  This happens regardless of whether you are sitting or standing, and this idea is known as the &quot;5 second rule&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also just because you are going to be spending a lot of time solo'ing doesn't necessarily mean it will be boring.  You are in a persistent 3D world with other players, after all.. :&gt;<br />
Here's an example.<br />
Sometimes when I'm not doing anything else, I fly around Hellfire Peninsula, which is the lowest zone you can fly in.  I hover around popular questing spots and look for druids that are in trouble.  When I spot a druid who is about to be killed by the mobs they are fighting, I swoop in, heal them, and kill their attackers.  It's great fun and the little druids are always so happy and surprised :&gt;<br />

The li'l ones then ran away super excited and left a wake of mob corpses everywhere they went :P I love helping out low levels. Heck, I buff and help everyone I come across now, and I'm only level 14 :P<br />
<br />
So, if I've got it right, Mana starts regening after 5 seconds? It isn't constant? How weird.</div></div><hr />

It isn't constant? How weird.Yes.  5 seconds after the last time you cast something.  For some folks, like healers and casting DPS classes (mages), they are always within the &quot;5 second rule&quot; when performing group PvE (5-mans, raids, etc.).  So, there are talents and gear that provides mana regen while within the 5SR.  This mana regen is called MP5 (mana per 5 seconds).  Druids have a talent called Intensity in the Resto tree that gives you 30% of your spirit (out of 5SR) regen while within the 5SR.</div></div><hr />

The fix was to do a re-install, which I did, but nada, still the same. Don't have any addons (wish I knew what THEY were :P).<br />
As I said I tried installing at work and I got the same crap, so I'm DLing the no-streaming 3.89 GB client to see if this one patches properly...

It may be the patch didn't have the right permissions to run -- make sure it's running as Administrator (right click it and select Properties... it's under the Compatibility tab, I think).<br />

If that doesn't work, open Windows Explorer and go to WoW's folder, but don't go INTO the folder.  Right click the WoW folder, select Properties, then go to the Security tab.  Click Advanced, Owner, Edit... change the owner of the folder to yourself, check &quot;Replace owner on subcontainers and objects&quot;, then click OK twice to close out both property windows.  Then, re-open the property window, go to Security again, and click Edit.

The zones were all EMPTY! I couldn't find any of the peeps whose names I remembered, and I got lost a half dozen times!!<br />
Went to Kelethin: NOT A SINGLE NEWBIE! Not even in Crushbone!! After this I don't think I'm EVER going back. WoW looks a million times better and the learning curve smaller compared to having to re-learn everything again in EQ.<br />
Was very disappointing.<br />
At least I got that out of my system :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">07-19-2008, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, EQ is mostly a ghost town at the lower levels.  I made a monk when TSS came out, and no one was leveling in groups.  If you wanted to level you pretty much needed a high level char to PL you.  No one in any of the old leveling spots (not even many at the new leveling spots).  Pretty sad compared to how it used to be.</div></div><hr />

I think that was probably the best experience for new players or players returning to the game.  It was impossible to find a mob to kill in lower guk there were so many people in it and when Kunark unlocked there were always 60+ people in CoM 24/7.<br />
Problem I had though was that I was playing 50+ hours per week and just barely staying at the bottom end of my guild's level requirements for raiding.  The progression went a bit too fast early on.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to return to EQ and not multibox they really need to find a reroll/nostalgia type guild so that there will be people to play with while leveling up.  If you do manage to find a group of people to play with imagine how much fun it would be since you can pretty much go wherever you want without camp competition.</div></div><hr />

Have a look at Kunark and Velious, maybe a Plane or two... I dunno, the Commonlands and other assorted beginner zones did not do it for me despite the memories.<br />
Can anyone tell me if there's a switch somewhere to turn the graphics on to better quality? :P<br />
Anyway, for the moment WoW &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EQ. It's so much more fun and properly thought out, at least what I've seen of it so far.</div></div><hr />
