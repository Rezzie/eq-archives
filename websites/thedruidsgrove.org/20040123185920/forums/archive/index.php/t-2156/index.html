<br />
I know in PoE there are the little dillos you can DC, but what about PoA, PoW and PoFire. Are there Druid - DC able mobs also? And if yes, which ones?<br />
<br />
Tubby</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dalien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">pofire - there's green horses/spiders you can DC<br />
<br />
powater - ditto, there's some green mobs occasionaly that can be DC'd near zonein.<br />
<br />
poair - nada.  this zone is worthless for exp groups though.  go there if you don't believe me, i guarantee your group wont stay there for more then an hour ;) <br />
<br />
note: all the DC'able mobs are basically &quot;group only&quot;, dont bother trying to solo with them.. there's no way they can tank the regular mobs in the zone, even if you fully buff and chain CH them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tubben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Would you say, you find DC useable, and worth the 9aa? I have now several AA banked, and still not sure wich AA to buy next. =)<br />

<br />
yes. if you're in elemental planes, it's VERY good for groups (ie holy trinity groups).  if you keep savage spirit on the pets they do like 120 DPS by themselves, not to mention you can nuke, buff, debuff, heal, etc also.  i get begged by my guild to come join PoE groups all the time because of it;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Plane of Fire - You can only dire charm the green con spiders the horses arnt animals.<br />
<br />
Plane of Water - Theres a small turtle I forget the name which is DCable its green con obiously.<br />
<br />
Plane of Air - The scorchlets (split from bigger birds) are DC able<br />
<br />
Plane of Earth - The mini armadilios are DCable they split from the bigger dillos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats the druid DC pets in Elementals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tenidina Wyndrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And it is dam fun to have a DC Phoenix as your pet, I look forward to it every raid, since POA is the 2nd most boring zone in the game (next to VT)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SilleyEskimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I love DC.  I use it all the time.  It's free DPS in any situation that a pet is available, leaving me free do all the nuking/healing/DoTing I want.  It's also good to hunt quest items with in old world zones.  I still use it all the time in Chardok.  A fully buffed DC pet can eat 3-4 MoBs before even needing a heal.  I took my GF and her Necro there and the DC pet basically PLed her on his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fayne Dethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DC is pretty much worthless in ele planes other than poearth groups, but quite nice for earth single group xp.   No one XPs off the entrance mobs in PoFire unless its to farm tradeskill components - the good xp is further in and no DC pets there or much of a viable way to get a pet there, Air - the only way you getting a phoenix pet is on a raid and then pets often cause more trouble than they are worth with the horrible pathing (thats why we need summon companion to work on DC pets), water - never really had the opportunity in a raid or xp group to get one as they are not around in useful areas.</div></div><hr />
