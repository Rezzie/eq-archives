I am an Alliance Druid.  lvl 22.<br />
I snuck all the way down to Wailing caverns, only getting killed once, to get the pattern for the Deviate scale belt and chest.  One of them is a quest and one is bought from the vendor there.  So I sneak in past all the Horde and deviate raptor things and by God I cant find the vendor.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me the location?  I really want to make the belt lol..  <br />

There will be a grey stone area.  If you change your camera view to where you're looking at the mouth of the entrance, it looks like a face.  From that view, the eye on the left is where the vendor is.  I dont know if allies can buy it there, but its worth a shot.  Anyways, you have to drop down on the nose part of the stone, then drop into the eye part.  It may take you a couple of tries, sometimes its not that easy.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
