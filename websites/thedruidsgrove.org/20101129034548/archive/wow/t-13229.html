Talent Dual Spec Q&amp;A with Ghostcrawler<br />
With the next content patch, we will be introducing a number of additions and changes to the game. One new feature in the works is the ability to set up two separate sets of talents, or &quot;dual spec&quot;. While the complete feature may not be immediately available in the Public Test Realms (PTR) and specifics are still liable to change, we wanted to go over some questions with Senior Game Designer Greg &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; Street to find out more.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: What is dual speccing?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Dual speccing is the ability to save two separate talent specs, glyphs, and action bars.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Why are we allowing players to dual spec after all this time?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We really felt like this was a great way to increase the flexibility available to players and encourage them to take part in more aspects of the game. To use just one example, some players like to participate in both raids and Arenas, which is awesome behavior that we want to promote. But, there are some talents which are more useful in one part of the game than another. Currently, players have to pay respec costs and go through the process of setting up the desired talent spec and action bars whenever they switch.<br />
<br />
The new system makes this a much more logical process, saving on time and cost and allowing players to easily move from one aspect of the game to another.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Who will be able to use it?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players who have reached the maximum level will be able to set up dual specs.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Why do players need to be max level in order to do this?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We didn’t want to burden lower-level players with extra complexity as they’re working to level up and learn their class. But if the feature proves popular we might consider expanding it.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: How will you be able to set up a dual spec?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players will be able to visit their trainer and pay a one-time fee to be able to use it.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: How do you switch between specs?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players will be able to switch between their talent specs by visiting any Lexicon of Power provided they’ve paid for the ability to have a secondary spec. Lexicons of Power will be available in major cities, and inscribers will also be able to create a new item that summons one. Anyone can purchase this item, but it requires a ritual of several players to summon it for use by the party. It’s similar to a repair bot in that it will exist in the world for a short duration. It’s important to keep in mind that you will not be able to switch specs while in combat or Arenas. While you won’t be able to switch your spec without the Lexicon, you will still be able to look at your secondary spec whenever you want to.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will solo players have the ability to switch their specs outside of the cities or will they still need to visit a Lexicon of Power?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Solo players will still need to go into the city to visit the Lexicon of Power to switch their talent spec or will need to get together with other players to summon one in.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Is the item that allows you to summon a Lexicon of Power reusable, or is it used up?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We haven’t made a final decision on that yet, and will be evaluating how it works on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Can I respec only one of my talent sets, or will I need to respec them both if I reset one?<br />
Ghostcrawler: When you reset your talents, it will look at the spec you currently have in use as the talent set you want to change.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will you be able to switch gear easily to match your spec?<br />
Ghostcrawler: At the same time we implement dual specs, we will also be setting up a gear system. The feature is called “Gear Manager.” It can also be used to just swap weapons or trinkets or put on that tuxedo to strut around town. It will not automatically switch your gear when you change your talent spec, but it will allow for an easy gear change between them. The feature may not be fully functional immediately in the PTR, but we’ll have more information to share about it before too much longer.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: What about hunters? Often their pet talents are set up to match the talents of the hunter. Will they be able to switch their pet specs as well?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We will wipe the pet talents. However we are going to remove the respec cost for pet talents so that players won’t feel like they need to jump through an additional hoop to respec their pet. In addition, we are going to provide hunters a new core ability to let them remotely access their stable on a long cooldown. This way if their exotic pet heads off to the stable, they will be able to get a different pet. We hope to be able to discuss this new spell in more detail when we get a little further along.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will you be able to change your Glyphs as well?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Glyphs will be tied to each talent spec so that if you switch between them, so too will the Glyphs. You’ll notice the UI will have changed a little bit so that the Glyph panes show up alongside the Talent panes now that they are associated.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: What about hotbars? Will players be able to save them for the talent spec they’re running?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Yes, you will be able to save hotbars and use them with your talent specs. It just saves your bars at the same time as it saves the glyphs and talents. If you want to switch to your other action bar, you will need to change specs.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Is there a way for players to choose their talents without them being saved? Currently, once you spend your talent point, it’s spent unless you pay the respec cost again.<br />
Ghostcrawler: With the dual spec feature, we are going to allow players who respec to configure all their talents before they get saved. They will be able to allocate the points, then choose if they want to use that as their spec, rather than needing to carefully diagram out their talents ahead of time. This will allow players a little more freedom when deciding on the talents they want to pick and avoid costly mistakes.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will players be confined to only setting up two specs?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We will be launching the feature with just two specs, but depending on how we feel it works out, we might consider additional specs in the future.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: When can players expect to try out dual specs?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players will be able to try out the dual spec system on the Public Test Realms when they are made available. This has been a pretty big project with a lot of people working toward making it a reality in the game. We’ll definitely be watching the feedback and looking for ways of making sure the system works the way we all envisioned it to.</div></div><hr />

i also like they are saying its coming with the next content patch - although ofc this could mean the next content patch is 6 months or more away ! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
its long overdue tbh - or why not just junk respec costs !</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah. 10g Respecc would be enough.<br />
And the whole respeccing would be no problem.<br />
Then maybe ulduar would be out by now. :smile: <br />
<br />
My theorie is that blizzard is using the whole dual-spec thing,<br />
to have an excuse to implement outfitter into the game. :tut:  <br />
<br />
And i find the posts of the blizzard people so funny when they are explaining what this new feature can do.<br />
Why dont they just say: &quot;It will work like Outfitter or ItemRack&quot;. :lmao:</div></div><hr />

something like outfitter is way way overdue to in the game tbh.<br />

thye cant say that s3R cos addons are bad / naughty and not allowed so no one in Blizz has ever actually seen Outfitter or Itemrack :eek: :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The big advantage of dual-specs over free-respecs is automatic  hotbar and glyph configuration.  If you have ever respec'd you know what a PITA it is to setup your bars again.</div></div><hr />

Well, stock up on your tranqs to sooth your rage!  When's the last time Blizzard removed a gold a sink????  (answer: never)<br />
<br />
Depending if the &quot;Summoning Lexicon&quot; is reusable or not will probably significantly impact the cost of inital setup.  I would expect the initial ability to be in the 1k-5k range and then have the mats for a Reusable Lexicon to be in the 1k range as well (thinking 5-10 abyss crystals).  If the Lexicon is a consumable I would expect more in the &quot;Elixir&quot; price/mats range or 20g-30g a shot.</div></div><hr />

When's the last time Blizzard removed a gold a sink????  (answer: never)I'm sure we'll get some idea of the number once it gets on the PTR.  Maybe I should drop Inscription (my failed 5K-8Kg experiment) now for mining and spend a week leveling mining (for the 3rd time).  Damn that will suck.<br />
<br />
I doubt the summonable LoP will cost all that much as I thought Blizzard said in a blue post a couple months back that &quot;there would be a nominal cost (think reagent level) to respec outside of a the city.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope you are right!  I fear that when all is said and done, it will cost approximatley the same as a respec now, but will keep action bars saved and glyphs saved.  <br />
<br />
No doubt that would be an upgrade from where it is now, but I hope its just a reagent!  My thoughts are that Scribes desperatley need a profitable trade, and this would seem to offer just that.</div></div><hr />

I like the fact that i can respecc without any cost in the cities but i dont like the fact that u can do it in a raid.<br />
U go in a raid with a talent-spec for purpose.</div></div><hr />

    From reading the interview about Dual Specs, it seems Blizzard wants the majority of their player base to have the system open to them. Keep in mind that 80% of their current player base are casuals who don't have 5k, 10k or 15k lying around, especially if they just bought or are planning to buy their epic flying skill.<br />
<br />
    1. A high cost cost doesn't cater to casuals. Blizzard is excited about this feature and wants it open to the majority of their player base.<br />
<br />
    2. In the interview, GC mentioned something about: if Dual Specs are popular we're considering opening it up to players less than level 80. 5k is ridiculous if you're less than 80, LOL.<br />
<br />
    3. A high initial cost totally defeats the purpose of having dual specs. For the hardcode player that respecs twice a day it would help in the long run, but for 80% of their players it would be useless.<br />
<br />
    I'm predicting it to be 50-100g, 500g tops.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue's Response....<br />
Awesome post. I really couldn't have said it better. And we do want to inform our players about what the final cost will be, but that is still under discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">exactly.<br />
<br />
if its more than 500g to get the ability and then more than 10g a time to respec its a pointless exercise and they should put effort into something more worthwhile.<br />
<br />
tbh all they should do is remove ALL respec costs for Lvl 80's.<br />
<br />
its stoopid to even have a respec cost at 80 as it restricts/curtails the ability to properly enjoy the varying aspects of the game they have introduced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm expecting 1000g just like cold weather flying.  I don't expect the summonable Lexicon to be all that expensive over the lifetime of the use ( ie like repairbots with # of charges maybe? ).  So, while the initial investment might be like 100g or so...with 5 or 10 charges it drops it to 10 - 20g per use.  Not all that expensive.<br />
<br />
Kheldar,<br />
<br />
I have to respectfully disagree with removing respec costs.  50g is FAR from much of a barrier in terms of preventing people from respec'ing...what prevents people more than anything: lack of gear, not wanting to replace glyphs all the time, not wanting to redo their action bars and keybindings.  As per Blizzard and Mods, you'd be surprised how much they enjoy the mod development community.  It is actively encouraged and they actively look for mods that are deemed &quot;required&quot; to play the game to integrate into WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well in the past before glyphs it caused some problems for us as a small guild and i see no point in making people pay to respec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-15-2009, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Respec costs were a barrier for me when I was running with a small family guild.  (~8 people).  That was back in the late vanilla WoW, early TBC era...so 50g was a lot more money back then.  <br />
<br />
I wasn't the one respecing at that time, but others in my guild (GL was a pally) were and they were often limited on what we could run based on the costs.  <br />
<br />
Today a single respec costs 100g-175g once figure in the cost of glyphs, and that is easily managable if you want it to be.  Regular respec's aren't affordable for casual questing type folks, but I don't think they are intended for those folks either.  You have to be raiding pretty regularily to round up gear for multiple specs.  I suppose the PvP folks are punished the worst, being that there is not much gold in PvP, and quite high expenses.  (Maybe repecs for honor instead of gold would help that).</div></div><hr />

Check out the new glyphs!!!<br />
<br />
From http://teethandclaws.blogspot.com/2009/02/patch-310-first-look.html<br />

Finally something for bears.  And now the new cat glyphs make pure-cat even more &quot;different&quot; than a bear/cat hybrid.</div></div><hr />

While I know &quot;everyone has gold&quot;, I find it a bit high given that though that they might make it available pre-80.  Who has 1000g at lvl 40?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, 1000g is a bad week of respec's for me.  I am happy to pay it!  :)<br />
<br />
And what level 40 needs to jump between multiple specs?  Usually you pick a leveling spec and go with it until you cap.  Respec'ing is a raid/pvp thing.  If you are PvPing at levels below cap, its likely that you are a twink (read:have more than enough gold) <br />
<br />
Plus how would dual spec work &lt;cap???  You have to change both &quot;Spec Trees&quot; each time you ding?  That would be a mess.  Just keep it at 80 and 1k gold isn't really that bad if the reagents are truely a minimal cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if you do, you don't respec for it!!!  <br />
<br />
Heck a feral can heal a level appropriate dungeon (in caster gear) up until ~lvl 55 ish instance.<br />
<br />
More importantly, who has multiple sets of gear while leveling?  I am leveling my hunter again, and all of the sudden realize I have a piece of gear that is like 6-8 levels below me equipped.  And he is only one spec, I can't imagine anyone really has a &quot;need&quot; to respec before level cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />

indeed in the old original days when i did raid i healed ZG/AQ20/AQ40/MC and BWL as feral specced using my healing set.<br />
<br />
well when i was levelling i did have 2 sets - my feral one and a heal one - mainly cos in them days most of the set drops were for healing....wildheart anyone.... :wink: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i thought they had already said that dual specs will only be for lvl 80 characters, but maybe amended at a later date ?<br />
<br />
i guess a 1000g is not bad for a one off cost. a few days of dailys to recoup it !</div></div><hr />
