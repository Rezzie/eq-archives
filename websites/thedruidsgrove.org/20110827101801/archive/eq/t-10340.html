 <br />
For instance im using http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5620 it has slot type 7. <br />
This http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23263 has slot type 4. <br />
I dont have enough augs or see to many atm in the bazaar to know whats best.<br />
 <br />
alla says the orb is better but i disagree from raw stats. hmm I will look some more and update as i find more info :)</div></div><hr />

None the less, the different aug-types are based on what kind of item it is.<br />
<br />
Type1-3 = LDoN bought-items<br />
Type4 = Weapons<br />
Type 5-6 = I'm not really sure if they exists. Never seen one and too lazy to search the net.<br />
Type7 = EP-gear and below. Some GoD. Some OoW. Some DoN (lower lvl of gear).<br />
Type8 = PoTime and equally (or better) gear.<br />
<br />
The more slots the better (in that regard), but to determin if an item with many slots is better than an item with only one slot you need to add what augments you can reasonably add to the items in a near future.</div></div><hr />

There arent many type one slot augs that are any good,so its nice to be able to stick an any type there.<br />

<br />
Not really usefull for us, but wars were making themselves 17/19 weapons out of LDoN.  Now even those are overprices given the ease of getting oow weapons.</div></div><hr />
