I've read most of the the reviews years ago, and a couple points have me stumped.<br />
<br />
'Mystery' Sub-quest: Platinum Speckled Powder<br />
 Chat with Merdan (SFG), he wants to give Niera ... something.<br />
 Forage a &quot;Rose of Firiona&quot; (FV, not No Trade)<br />
 Give the Rose to Merdan, receive a &quot;Wood Painting&quot;<br />
 Give the Painting to A Human Skeleton (FM), receive a &quot;Silver Chained Locket&quot;<br />
 Give the Locket to Niera, receive her Platinum Speckled Powder.Was anybody else as lost as I was?<br />
<br />
Re: #3. Back in the day when Velious was new and my main character was bound in the Firiona Vie outpost it was not uncommon role playing for guys to give girls a &quot;Lady's Mantle&quot; as a gift.  So maybe Merdan could give Niera a flower, that much I can understand.<br />
<br />
Re: #4. Wood Painting, uh, okay. I seem to be missing the point here and I can not get wimpy Merdan to respond to any other questions regarding the painting. It identifies as &quot;Painting for Niera&quot; but she returns it to me. As to how the painting is supposed to get to the skelly? In Frontier Mountains??  Who figured out that tidbit?<br />
<br />
Re: #5. Chatting with Niera ends with &quot;Even if my life were in the balance, I would have a hard time giving it up.&quot; It being the small bag of speckled, flecked powder. This bit of reasoning I can understand, the locket identifies as &quot;Niera's Locket&quot; so giving it to her is not a stretch of the imagination.<br />
<br />
No words spoken. Not about the painting, not about the locket.  Hindsight helps put the pieces of the story into place, but steps like #4 make me wonder if something is missing or has been lost.<br />
<br />
Any insight or clarification on this part of an old quest would be appreciated. Thank you!</div></div><hr />

It's been a very long time, but I believe it was something similar to that.  A NPC in SFG hints to such, I think (may have been FV, was 5 or 6 years sine I last looked at that.).<br />
