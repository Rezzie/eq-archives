<br />
Was helping a group with the Lost Gnomes mission for DSK.  The Cleric gets lost and dies while running the Hive.  No big deal, I can call her and use Shared Camo when she appears.<br />
<br />
So I tell her I am going to call her, but not to accept until the roamer paths.  She doesn't see it, clicks anyway, roamer aggros - kills her, chain aggros, entire room charges me at the door to the instance.<br />
<br />
Now, I turn around, and zone.<br />
<br />
Zoning taking forever, and I am thinking, those 5 spiders just killed me.<br />
<br />
To my surpirse....<br />
<br />
I zone into the Living Larder with negative 600 hitpoints (out of negative 760 max) and proceed to lay there uncouncious for the next minue and a half while my regen slowly brings me back to 1 percent health, at which point I stand up, and patch myself.<br />
<br />
I doubt I'll ever top that zone.  Thought I'd share the AAs are a good investment =p<br />

I rely on delay death more than second life since they had nerfed the proc rate on it. Tho, during a group in AG the other night, we had gotten trained somehow near the eggtenders, and my second life had proc'd for me 3 times in a row, so I had enough time to move all the mobs away from the shaman that did not get aggro so he could call the cleric, and position myself to die close enough for a drag and away from other mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, it's really nice to have delay death. If you fall unconscious and second life does not proc, and you get a chance and stand back up, it gives you another chance for second life to proc.</div></div><hr />

I have no clue what that &quot;changed unknown&quot; things are lol.<br />
<br />
But from when it was first released, it would proc like mad, but a bit afterwards, it didn't want to proc if my life had depended on it (which it does!). But some other druids had said the proc rate was nerfed. So...I have no clue, but it does seem like it had been nerfed alot.<br />

It has two verisons one of GoD and one of Anguish, the two endzones we've unlocked so far.  Hitting refresh changes it.  My girlfriend &lt;3s me lots.</div></div><hr />

I was playing with one of the named in Buried Sea zone, maybe it was Shellara or Pythos ... anyway it was one of those mobs that stuck a HUGE DoT on me.   I wasn't expecting the damage, so I hit Convergence of Spirits as reflex and it countered the effect (mostly).   Druid fall down purple club, stand up, fall down, stand up, fall down.   I cycled through it several times.  Finally ended up on the ground stable at neg500some HPs and eventually regen'd enough to stand up just as root broke and I got creamed anyway  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Second Life and the RNG is kind to me somedays, and others its just mean.  Being a tradeskiller, I'm used to the notion of getting screwed by the machine.  Tuesday night in Solteris I had 2ndLife fire for me on six consecutive beatdowns,  with one of those being a three shot.  So actually it fired on 8 of 8 chances.   Wednesday night, however, I was clicking the respawn box all night, it never saved me not once!   Much H8!</div></div><hr />

Some days it fires loads, once I was the last one standing in a Doasheen raid and it kept proccing lol. Chain procced on OMM once too when I hailed him for a laugh after the rest of the raid TL'd out.<br />
 <br />
Then other times I dont get a single proc :(</div></div><hr />

Second life lasts just long enough to do a short move/ run and then camp.  I have even been summoned while camping out and still managed to camp.  This gives your group a second chance at recovery, for just in case the nonagro shammy actually does have agro perhaps.<br />

The top level apparently costs 100 trib/10 min. Anyone have this? Or have further information as to its effectiveness?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">08-09-2007, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you referring to Second Chance?  That tribute option is more like Second Life than Delay Death.  It appears to provide 2%, 4%, and 6% chances of Touch of the Divine firing at ranks 1, 2, and 3 respectively:<br />

<br />
(Second Life gives you a 25% and 29% chance at rank 1 and 2.)<br />
<br />
As for whether it stacks with Second Life, in theory it should since tribute effects are treated as worn effects, and worn effects generally stack with spells.  Setting up a test to confirm this would be very difficult, though.</div></div><hr />

I have had the 2ndChance tribute work only twice, its not a very high chance to fire, but since tribute is so very easy to amass, I keep it running when the occassion calls.</div></div><hr />
