Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) -- my guest on Salon Radio today -- yesterday pointed out that the bill passed by both the Senate and House to de-fund ACORN is written so broadly that it literally compels the de-funding not only of that group, but also the de-funding of, and denial of all government contracts to, any corporation that &quot;has filed a fraudulent form with any Federal or State regulatory agency.&quot;  By definition, that includes virtually every large defense contractor, which -- unlike ACORN -- has actually been found guilty of fraud.  As The Huffington Post's Ryan Grim put it:  &quot;the bill could plausibly defund the entire military-industrial complex.  Whoops.&quot; (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/22/whoops-anti-acorn-bill-ro_n_294949.html)<br />

ACORN should be defunded of any taxpayer funds and grants, and have its tax exempt status revoked.<br />
<br />
And then audited and investigated just like ENRON.<br />
<br />
If it is a red herring, which implies that there is some ulterior motive, what is the ulterior motive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it is a red herring, which implies that there is some ulterior motive, what is the ulterior motive.Let's assume ACORN is guilty of every single accusation made against it.<br />
<br />
How much money are we talking about here?  How does it compare to the money we're still throwing down the toilet in Iraq, or to hospitals to treat fat people in their ERs?<br />
<br />
In terms of priorities, ACORN is like #5,884,382, but Congress is treating it like it's some sort of emergency, because they're too busy scoring political points instead of dealing with real issues.  They're even willing to screw up the country, and break more important things, just to fix one stupid little thing.<br />
<br />
It's not because ACORN is important, but rather because the &quot;Republicans&quot; want to show how conservative they are by punishing any group that looks remotely liberal, and the Democrats are embarrassed and want to sever any possible ties with liberal groups that behave badly.<br />

Stupid politicians, wasting our money doing stupid things.  That's America.</div></div><hr />

The barracks for Iraqi soldiers, done so poorly that the piping in the floor above was leaking feces and piss down in the chow hall amongst, many of the light fixtures, also causing an electrical fire that burnt that mambajamba to the ground.  The hospital with all the modern amenities, except sewage and power, built with the nearest city, or town for that matter was 50 miles away. Sank a good 100 million in that one before they cut funding when the contractors asked for another 32 million. Other fun stuff in Iraq, building something for current and future use, in five years they had to rebuild stuff that was supposed to last about 30-40 years.<br />
<br />
I always enjoyed the things like the FMTV's the government bought us to use to replace the older model trucks.  I loved the fact that driving at 45 miles per hour could cause your drive train to fall out, happened regularly. The braces bending and breaking were fun.  The fan in that vehicle was fun as well, I won't get technical on that end, but, needless to say, replacing all of them were very expensive. Plus, some other fun things with those models.  Sometimes, I think many suppliers would just rush out what they have, for the additional when stuff screws after a week of service, contracts.<br />
<br />
Since ,I was a guardsman, fun things like the berets. That was a 100 million dollar contract to outfit everyone in the army with 2 of them. Of course compound the fact that was a pretty hefty portion of the Army budget at the time, but, what the hell, Spetember 11th just happened so, we needed to look the part of the hero, plus we were going to get an even bigger budget. Great just what I needed as a guardsman, a stupid hat I could wear only for morning formation and dismissal, or the occasional miltiary funeral. Nevermind, the fact we sent soldiers into combat in Iraq later with rubber doors on their humvees(they were cheap to train with), then, wondered why IED's were killing them.<br />
<br />
Civilian world funnies, things like FFel that could be a self suffienct government program, instead used to subisidize private industry with no profit loss opportunities for them.  Fun stuff, them getting 97% paid by the government, if, the college loan is unpaid, then get to collect another 38 % on top of that as well.  Plus, consolidation of your car payment into a larger interest drawer, so, if you don't pay, the government pays the 97%, they keep the car and resell it, then collect the 38%, win win.</div></div><hr />
