<br />
i have hit lvl 53 now (feral spec) and was thinking of respecing balance once i hit 58 for outlands i seen so many moonkins battle grounds that just dont die and seems like a good way to go <br />
<br />
what i would like to know is what is it like leveling with balance spec?<br />
<br />
(sorry if this has been posted before)<br />
<br />
i will eventually respec once 70 to try all the different aspecs of the druid.<br />
<br />

<br />

I've heard from others that feral is the way to go for faster leveling, but I've found that balance has been good for me. I solo about 50% of the time. Balance gives me a little boost for soloing and groups...besides, gotta love the moonkin. &lt;g&gt; Very nice effect in a group.</div></div><hr />

I was in the same boat as you and specced moonkin (sometime in the mid 40's).  It was really really fun but I could not kill as fast as feral (I was basically wearing any casters gear I could find mixed in with feral gear because I had no other alternatives).  I know it is because of my gear that made life miserable as a moonkin but I am waiting till outland and get good moonkin gear there then respec.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even enter outlands until i made it to 60, as I didn't want to run out of quests too soon, most of my friends told me to hold on that.  Anyhow... i found that waiting for HF quests allows you to build up a pretty decent set of &quot;starter&quot; casting based leathers for a moonkin.  I was quite happy with the change.</div></div><hr />

The play style of root/dot/dps blasting is much different that pounce/dot/dps in cat form.... hey wait a sec....</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I found it to generally be more fun (and I don't like getting hit) it's definitely not as fast to level as going Feral imo.  For variety it's well worth giving it a go for a while just to try it out if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Once advantage that it does have is that it is a lot easier to collect resto kit (if you're intended to explore that option later) as Balance than it is Feral for obvious reasons</div></div><hr />

<br />
Faster than resto, slower than feral.<br />
Sorry I can't be more detailed than that, I have no experience levelling up as a Moonkin.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i will eventually respec once 70 to try all the different aspecs of the druid.<br />
<br />
This is always the best plan.  Even if you try them all and decide to just go back to your original spec, it will have a great impact on your understanding of the druid class overall, and will make you into a better druid.<br />
