Does it matter which mount I buy? I know more expensive ones are faster but do they give better mana regen also or is the advantage in mana regen strictly the fact taht you are sittign on the horse adn get sitting regen rate?</div></div><hr />

The only difference between the 9k and 120k mounts is their speed, and doesn't affect your mana regen.</div></div><hr />

For a druid I can't really see any reason to get anything but the lowest priced mount (since I am of the belief that you either get the 100k (speed and med) or the 9k (just med) mounts, and anything inbetween is a complete waste of money).<br />
<br />
My main is a Nec, so I got the fastest mount for aggro kiting (before the acceleration nerf) and general travel, but for my druid I plan on just getting a 9k mount.<br />
<br />
The benefits are: medding without sitting aggro; medding while casting, right-clicking proc items, and also while looting I think; and also memming spells without sitting aggro.</div></div><hr />

You don't get med mana while casting, moving or attacking.  If you're not doing anything, then you get the meditate benefits.<br />

The only advantage to having a horse is sit aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the increased mana regen. The only advantage is NOT avoiding sit aggro. I knwo you gain mana regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You DO get med mana while casting.  Not while moving or attacking, true, but when casting, yes you do gain the med benefit.<br />
<br />
Test it.  Go to toilers in ME, pull a single, and root/rot it without the horse.  Now do another, and root/rot with the horse.  If all your DoTs are applied and you have nothing else to do, keep casting a clickie DoT.  Basically, just always be casting something.<br />
<br />
You will see you have more mana doing it with the horse than compared to without.<br />

<br />
Innate Metabolism helps with that a great deal.<br />
<br />
Your horse doesn't eat anything though. It just makes you consume food/drink at twice the rate(?) you normally do, so if you're the type who force feeds yourself or whatever, then just doing that keeps it from eating it up.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm this... what did he say about clicking proc items?  I hadn't heard anything about this...</div></div><hr />

Proccing items only go off in combat. But yes, since we're already unfortunently discussing this, you do regen mana well using a right click item, such as using epic on a mob, it's not only mana free, but you can regen like normal too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rest of the benefits I listed I know to be true.<br />
<br />
I said &quot;right-click proc item&quot; since I still run into people who do not know what a &quot;right-clicky&quot; is. I meant items like mana robes, elder spiritist's vambraces, and so forth.</div></div><hr />

What are the differences between Horse and Drogmar? from what I've heard,<br />
<br />
Horse:<br />
annoying head in the middle of the screen<br />
<br />
Drogmar:<br />
bounces up and down while moving, makes people sick in first person view. :p<br />
<br />
I've also heard a probably-false rumor that drogmars are slightly slower than horses.<br />
<br />
Also... <br />
<br />
 does spirit of eagle stack with the horse buff? ie can you have both up, then just click off the horse/drogmar when you want to move around? <br />
 If you have the slowest drogmar and soe up, will you run at soe speed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They stack so that you can click it off and run at SoE speed. You will move at run3/jboot speed if you have the slowest horse/drogmar up.<br />
<br />
There is no difference beyond visual between horse and drogmar.</div></div><hr />

Then when i wanted to move fast i just clicked off the drog icon. It worked fine. But the sow did not work on the drog.  It only worked on me after I clicked off the drog icon. <br />

<br />
If you're on a horse and plinking away on a bow, do you still get the benefits of the mana regen?<br />
<br />
Thanks all in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome, thanks for the extremelly quick reply. It's appreciated.<br />
<br />
Ok, another quick question for ya then. Last one I promise. <br />
<br />
Why do you get the benefit when bowing but not meleeing? Does it detect auto attack being pressed and therefore cancels the effect out somehow?<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have no clue - but its the same as throwing from my understanding and they still gain mana also.<br />
 <br />
 As for verification though.. I would of course ask a ranger running around riding a horse.. but from my understanding from other rangers this was the case back when I asked. - the Understanding was that Melee was direct combat &quot;you push a button to activate it, and it continues to hit&quot; and Archery was not .. IE: its not automelee.. there is a pause which allows the mana regen to work inbetween the actual &quot;plunk&quot; of the bow.<br />
 <br />
 But then you always have to watch out for the stealth nerfs etc... so just log on do a /who all 65 ranger .. find a friendly name and pop the question.. they would know best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xskwizit</div><div class="date">05-26-2004, 02:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, will do. Also, if that's the case, I hope it doesn't matter that I use an auto archery program to do the shootin'. Heh. <br />
<br />
Take care, Sobe. Thanks for your help and advice.</div></div><hr />
