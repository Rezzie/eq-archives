<br />
The purpose of this guide is to help dispel the myth that GoD has nothing to offer non-elemental/time guilds.  Discord is a challenging expansion, but, it is well worth the risk for players of all styles.  It won’t make casual players uber overnight, but it will allow you to get some very decent upgrades and set you on the path.<br />
<br />
Traveling in GoD:<br />
Getting around in GoD is more difficult than getting around in PoP.  It’s old style EQ travel.  You need to pass through zones full of stuff that want you dead to get to anything.  Do not be discouraged.  It is no more difficult getting around here as it was in Kunark, Velious, or Luclin when they first came out.  They key to successful travel is not fixed duration invisibility, though that helps, or taking the direct route.  The secret is to be prepared.  If you are not an invisibility caster, keep a supply of invisibility potions on you.  Keep them in your bank as well incase you need them to do a corpse recovery.  I recommend making periodic visits to Abysmal Sea for them.  The general supplies vendors across the hall from the bank sells them for under 4 plat.  <br />
<br />
Here are tips to getting around in GoD:<br />
1.  Direct routes will usually get you killed.  If you zone in, cast invisibility and then proceed to make a “b-line” to the zone, you will die, possibly taking other players with you.  Simply don’t do it.  Take a cautious approach to your route.  Stick to zone walls.  In Qinimi, for example.  The safest route is to follow the right zone wall.<br />
2.  Assume all Mobs between you and your goal see invis.  If there is a mob dangerously close to your path, consider them.  If they con anything but indifferent wait for them to path away, pacify them or carefully go around them.<br />
3.  Pay attention to “You are about to appear” messages.  You will die of you don’t pay attention to it.  If you do not have a fixed duration invis and you see this message, take action fast.  You need to move away from any mobs.  You can usually find a nearby corner that is just out of agro range and safe enough to recast invis.  Better yet.  Have a potion ready to click.  You can cast instant invis potions while standing next to mobs without ever being seen.  <br />
4.  Do not hesitate to take a detour if your path is too risky.  Sometimes, there are see invis mobs up in the long Corridor leading from Qinimi in Barindu.  What do you do then?  You take the long way around.  Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi all have connections with each other.  All of these zones are relatively small.  You can fit all of these zones into one the size of the Dreadlands.  If your way is blocked in Barindu, Zone out, go to Riwwi, cross that zone and zone in to Barindu from there.  Taking the time to travel through Riwwi is a lot faster than doing a corpse recovery because you wanted to try to sneak by that wandering See invis mob.<br />
5.  Hate them or love them, Download maps.  Use them.  They will help you plan your routes and show you where zone lines are.  Sure, some feel it’s cheating, but,  They are invaluable.<br />
<br />
But the mobs hit too damn hard!<br />
There is one thing that can’t be denied about Gates of Discord.  The mobs hit like freight trains.  SOE decided to take a different approach this time.  The mobs in this expansion hit much harder than anywhere else, but, they have far fewer hitpoints.  It is common to hear terrifying tails of trash mobs hitting for 1200.  This combined with the challenges to travel and no graveyards keeps non-ubers away from these zones.  In reality, not all zones are stacked with mobs quadding for 1k plus.<br />
<br />
Single groups should avoid Ferubi, Vxed, Tpit and the Purifying Plant.  It is pretty easy to get overwhelmed in these zones if you are not equipped with at least Vex-Thal quality gear.  On the other hand Qinimi, Riwwi, and some of the Sewer zones like The Crematory are decent spots.  Experience is on par with LDoN runs but the real reason to go to these places is to get better gear.   It’s not a fast process, but, it is definitely worthwhile.  In all of these zones very nice items can rarely drop from trash mobs.  Most of these items are BoT quality or better.  Items from the sewers are easily Vex-Thal quality.<br />
<br />
But aren’t the sewers trial zones?<br />
Yes they are.  Gates of Discord has 6 zones designed for trials to get access to Kod’Taz.  The High Priest in Barindu starts you off on your way.  You do not, however, need to use these zones as a trial.  There is a NPC named Gamesh standing behind the pyramid in Barindu.  He will gladly spawn any of the four sewer zones.  They are identical to the trial zones but will not get you a flag.  The Crematory is a good starting point.  Mobs are moderately harder than LDoN normal mobs and eventually ramp up to hard mode strength deep inside.  If you can handle Bastion of Thunder, you can handle the Crematory.  Loot can drop from rare named spawn (the zone does respawn) or rarely from any mob.  Two examples of Sewer loot are:<br />
<br />

<br />
Casual guilds can raid too!<br />
Uber guilds are uber for one reason.  They raid.  The traditional problem that smaller guilds have had is that they can’t commit the kind of time it takes to get keyed and flagged for places like the Elemental Planes and Vex-Thal.  This has caused massive disparities between gear between ubers and non-ubers.  Believe it or not, GoD can help remedy some of that.  Barindu and Ferubi are two excellent zones that non-uber guilds can raid in.  Both of these zones have named mobs that a decent raid force of non-ubers can handle.  Ferubi is particularly good for this since it has a very fast respawn.  If it cons yellow in Ferubi, your raid can kill it.  If it cons yellow and you kill it, you will be rewarded.  These mobs drop everything from AC15 and 25hp/mana/endurance augmentations to loot that is Vex-Thal quality or better.<br />
<br />
Barindu is also a good choice.  Named drop very good gear and random unnamed can drop outstanding loot as well, such as:<br />
<br />
Fractured Obsidian Band<br />

Conclusion<br />
After reading many boards it has become apparent that people have been shying away from awesome potential.  There seems to be a general “this expansion is for the smallest portion of players.” sentiment.  This is just not true.  GoD is much more challenging than what most are used to, but, it also holds greater potential for advancement than any other expansion to date.  This is the first time non-uber players will be able to significantly increase their power in the form of gear.  If used properly, GoD can allow players to gear up to the point where they have a much better chance at the rest of EQ.<br />
<br />
If you are satisfied with grinding in Bastion of Thunder and Halls of honor and aren’t interested in actually advancing your character, then GoD isn’t for you.  If you are tired of the same old grind and are looking for adventure, challenge and very decent reward, then push forward.</div></div><hr />

From the lack of interest i'm seeing I fully expect GoD to end up being about as popular as LoY once the newness wears off. It's not just that the mobs are brutal, the zones unfriendly and the need for good gear high (although all these are true) it's that it takes a significant time commitment from a well balanced group of skilled and well geared players. Something that the LFG crowd can *not* assume they're going to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 01:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lack of interest?  Where do you get that idea?  There's a lot to do for people that are up for a challenge, and some pretty good rewards to make up for the high risk.  If you're talking about the 3 hour expeditions and such, many times you can swap people in partway through.  We've brought some random lfg people too and done just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireiina</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get that idea from the people I talk to in EQ, the guild i'm in and the class boards I read. PoP had a lot more buzz than GoD seems to have been able to manage. <br />
<br />
I'm happy to be wrong of course, but we'll see how it develops. The mass of the EQ population naturally flows to what it perceives as the best balance of &quot;risk vs. return&quot; and &quot;fun&quot; and we'll see how well GoD fares over time. I will certainly risk stating that historically the &quot;non-uber&quot; population has been negative towards having to traverse &quot;hot&quot; zones and doing CR's but we'll see how well this balances up against the positives GoD offers. We'll also have to see if SoE can resist their urge to nerf drops into non-existence.<br />
<br />
However the *real* proof is that the first post sounds eerily like propoganda. It strikes me as very odd that people are using such emotive language and denigrating alternatives. That sounds like a reaction to the suspicion that many people are giving GoD a miss. Let me guess, BoT is still full of people and you can't guess why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teaenea</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can call it propoganda, though it is not.  You can chose to disbelieve the information and advice I have given.  If someone choses to do that it's their loss. This was a sincere attempt to give non-ubers information that I have seen lacking on may boards.  GoD is a very good expansion for non-ubers to get a bit closer to ubers on gear so they can move beyond what they have done so far.  It's not a walk in the park like PoP currently is, but, if you are not in Vex-Thal or Elemental planes, you will not get anything close to what GoD has to offer.  I just think people are needlessly intimidated by it at the moment.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the kind words Princess.  :)<br />
<br />
Interesting, the elemental players taking over from SoE on handling the advertising? From the lack of interest i'm seeing I fully expect GoD to end up being about as popular as LoY once the newness wears off.

<br />
And Yes, I am currently an Elemental player.  But this hasn't always been the case.  I've only been in an elemental guild for about 8 months now.  Previously I was in a small guild that finally disbanded after 3 years.  I've seen both sides of the Uber/non-uber debates.  I have many friends that are not in elemental guilds.  I base my information on what they can handle.  I'm not posting this information becuase I'm Elemental.  I'm posting it because I'm a fan of MMORPGs and EverQuest and I see something people are unclear on.<br />
<br />
I will admit that if you are in pickup group crowd GoD will be much harder.  But to small guilds that like to hunt and play together, this information is more than valid.</div></div><hr />

YES GoD drops are nice, there is one in Natimbi that drops off a low level named that sells for 15k on the low end on saryn Server Painted Tribal Warmask.  However, getting a group going in GoD or getting picked for one is a nightmare.  The mobs definitely hit way too hard and can guad for 1800 easily very few non elemental players have the gear to withstand that and those that do im happy for u but right now it needs to be seriously repatched and rethought out.  Especialy since most of the items are NO DROP this includes our spells which means they wont be bought if more than one drops and cant be used it rots thats useless.</div></div><hr />

Way too many people who don't know how to play their class well are going there expecting POP like easy zones. Thats not the case They are challengeing but doable by non elemental people.<br />
<br />
The guide matches exactly my experiences with hunting there. Ya I have died several times there but I am learning the zones and those deaths will decrease over time.<br />

Gonna post a copy of the orginal on TNZ board as I think it would do well there.<br />

I know its easy to be cynical and expect this off of Sony.. But... In the first weekend my group had 5 nice items from trash mobs (including the larva cape and FT2 ring listed above), but since then we've had nothing, and have killed atleast 3-4x as many mobs as we did that first weekend.<br />
<br />
Just wondered if my group has been unlucky (or was v lucky that first weekend) or if anyone else is experiencing this...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems to be standard for every expansion though - they have to drop a few times to get the word out about what is there then once people know they get made rare.<br />
<br />
Really nice guide!  I'm enjoying the expansion.  The downside is that it isn't something you want to do if you only have 2-3 hours.  Travel time is a real factor so you only go when you have a group that you think will stick together for several hours.  I agree though that it has some nice content for small guilds.</div></div><hr />

The few times I have gone though, I have really enjoyed it.  Its like the EQ I remember enjoying from old.  I think its great.  WIsh they would add a couple of port spots though.  Not everyone has extended time to play, and its great that you can add people into your groups, but not so great if they can't get to you!<br />

No exp mob quad for 1800 in zones I mentioned in my original post.  The first one group mobs I've seen that do that are in Vxed and are yellow conned.  In fact I specifically suggest zones like Cremetory where mobs hit less than BoT mobs and have fewer hp in BoT as well.  And I specifically said &quot;Single groups should avoid Ferubi, Vxed, Tpit and the Purifying Plant. It is pretty easy to get overwhelmed in these zones if you are not equipped with at least Vex-Thal quality gear.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tried to put together a pick-up group (my time-flagged guild provided 4 people including the tank) to farm the 30hp/mana augs from Tipt and I was amazed by how many people I talked to said they didn't buy GoD cause they weren't in an elemental flagged guild.   It's  not just for us.<br />
<br />
Another time I took a non-elemental, non-VT flagged warrior as the MT in Tipt.  We struggled, but we eventually beat the first boss and got him an aug.  It can happen, it's just not easy.<br />
<br />
We had a guild on our server who has yet to do ANY Tier 3 mobs farming elites in Ferubi for 25hp/mana augs.  Any 25 people could do it, as long as you had a few of the essential classes.<br />
<br />
I am loving this expansion.  I am being challenged again.  There IS a steep power curve, but that's only a reason to rise to the challenge, IMO.</div></div><hr />

punctiation is your friend.... well obviously its not yours.<br />
From what you say in your post, i get the impression that all you care about is selling things in the bazaar? the stuff is no drop obviously so that you gear up people IN YOUR GROUP. not to some rich fool who bought 100k pp from yantis. i for one like that they make htings no dop, it doesnt **** with the economy and you actually have to work for your own items.</div></div><hr />

God, why do people have to take a post and twist it to what they think it says.  This is stupidity at its finest and now yeah im slightly annoyed.  I stated in my posting that it was an opinion and only an opinion and no i dont sell everything i get half the time i yelling something rotting at such and such a place come and loot, HOWEVER, if i have something on  and i upgrade to something else doesnt it make sense to give it to someone else who can use it if i can anylonger rather than destroy it.</div></div><hr />

This was said in my original guide and mentioned again.  Ferubi is not for single groups of non-elemental people.  It is, however, good for Raids of Non-Elemental people.  In Addition, The EXP mobs in Ferubi do not quad for 1800+ It is the named that do.</div></div><hr />

Raid wise so far we have found so many broken high end raids its getting ridiculous and I am hoping its fixed soon. As for Trials - OMG even the toughess players are having a Hard time.. thats all good.   <br />

I don't care if mobs hit for 1800 or 2700, if we can push thru and learn the best way to over come the obstacles then I am for it. If you can't stand the pain - go back to the other expansions until you have the gear and stamina to take on Gates</div></div><hr />

Thanks Sobe.  I'm like you, I like to push what I can do as much as possible.  Vxed named, for example, are challenging to Elemental geared players.  Tpit is also very challenging.  This hasn't stopped me from pushing through the trials or from grabbing 5 guildies and doing a fast kill of a Vxed named or two after a raid.  We have all died alot, but mostly have been enjoying the challenge.  I do think that they could have made the trials a bit shorter, but, they aren't that bad really.</div></div><hr />

Its very well written.  I really appreciate your time and effort and willingness to share this with everyone.  Don't let the naysayers get you down !</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a shame, but a lot of people, really don't read the posts.  Especially long ones.  They just skip and skim and take what they want from it.  Your guide has motivated me somewhat to work on my gear and find a regular group to go to GoD with.  I can take the punishment a hard LDoN puts out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quinalla</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you very much for the guide!  I am one who has avoided going to the new GoD zones because I am not geared up and from what folks were saying the mobs hit really hard.  It was nice to have a comparison between PoP zones and GoD zones so we have an idea of how hard they hit.  I agree with you there are a lot of people who don't think they can handle GoD zones and are sticking to what they know, PoP and LDoN.  Anyway, much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

We are thinking about trying to get through without crashing in Natimbi and see what the rest holds.<br />
<br />
Again a great guide, don't let the people who criticize without even bothering to read what you said get you down.  First few weeks LDoN was out we had constant posts that it was almost impossible for Bazaar/Casual players to win even normal destroy missions.   Although they have not changed in difficulty as far as I know, Normal/Destroy missions are about a 25 minute or less affair for casual players now and many are having good luck with hard missions.<br />
<br />
There are many people who are not willing to try and experiment if they can not sit in their no risk xp spot without risk of dieing, they don't want to hear about it.  That is fine for them.  They do need to stop attacking others for encouraging people to explore.</div></div><hr />

I know its easy to be cynical and expect this off of Sony.. But... In the first weekend my group had 5 nice items from trash mobs (including the larva cape and FT2 ring listed above), but since then we've had nothing, and have killed atleast 3-4x as many mobs as we did that first weekend.<br />
<br />
Just wondered if my group has been unlucky (or was v lucky that first weekend) or if anyone else is experiencing this... Hi there.<br />
<br />
The drop rates haven't changed in any of the zones post-release. I'm guessing you just got a little lucky that first day or two there compared to the rest of the days.<br />
<br />
Nice write-up, by the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wont make me buy GoD since im to sick of SoEs lamer con-artist sales tactics. Leaving bugs like the tribute system in at release when they know theyre going to nerf it a few days later is simply unethical and im not going to buy any more SoE products for a long while.<br />
<br />
Still a good guide though so thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karanthal</div><div class="date">03-01-2004, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried the purifying plant with a group from my current guild (elemental+ gear) and a group from my old guild (HoT-Low end PoP gear).  <br />
<br />
It is obviously far easier with an elemental group, but even with a tank mostly equipped with HoT drops, we managed to make slow prgress.  While we didnt complete the adventure, I think it would have been possible with enough time.<br />
<br />
With an ele group its constant pulling, it was quite simple to offtank an add for a while because GoD mobs atk is low in comparison to a ele tanks AC.  A HoT tank on the other hand really gets whacked so debuffing before pull, or stunning mobs on inc helped a lot.<br />
<br />
It needs far more thinking about to get a lesser equipped group through, but thats what makes it more interesting and being as we tried the Purifying Plant we were doing pretty well.</div></div><hr />

I found that to be the hardest of the first four trials.  People in your old guild should be in pretty good shape then, at least until they reach trial 5. :)</div></div><hr />

Either the random drops were nerfed, or a whole bunch of us have had extremely lopsided luck.  I remember getting a bunch of the to-good-to-be-true random drops in the first week and a half, then absolutely nothing, despite spending a lot of time in the same zones.  Smells like usual loot bait and switch to me, the same one we have seen in almost every expansion.  Can anyone say, for example, that they've gotten a Chanting Stone Mask in the past week?  Or any other one of the good random loots?</div></div><hr />

I hadn't gone into any GoD zones because the perception was that unless you were elementally geared, you were pretty much out of luck. I basically bought GoD for the tribute system, which I love btw. <br />

Now, If I can only convince my small guild to get a group and head out there.<br />

Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellzii</div><div class="date">06-15-2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Teaenea tends to be the optomist, I tend to be quite a bit more cynical. I agree with certain points in Tea's posts though. <br />
<br />
Nice items are dropping off Random Mob_0045:<br />
Traveling in GoD can be done if you are paitient and willing to watch pathing.<br />
PAY ATTENTION! PAY ATTENTION! PAY ATTENTION! This cannot be stressed enough. <br />
Mobs hit like freight trains.<br />
<br />
Things I feel Tea failed to mention in the post:<br />
Drops are not like candy. They may have been in the first couple days, but you can expect standard random drop rates now.<br />
If you don't know, expect something to hit for 1K, they can.<br />
If you were around for the Kunark Expansion, running through the zones in GoD reminded me alot of running through Trak's Teeth at level 40. The mobs can be killed but it takes a group/raid who can work tight together. Someone mentioned to me Maidens Eye at level 40 would be a good comparison as well.<br />
God was set up with a level 70 cap in mind. It has been retuned, but it's still high level.<br />
If you are level 65 with the best of Bizarre bought gear you should be able to survive it. It is really still geared too high for most non raiding guilds however. (I distinguish a difference between Casual/Non Casual, and Raiding/Non Raiding).<br />
<br />
As far as Tea goes, I can assure you Teaenea is neither an apologist nor a Sony employee. While we disagree on some of the finer points for the most part the expansion is not as bad as it could have been.<br />

i thought you had to be 65 to get sewers, tipt, vxed?<br />
<br />
maybe i'm thinkign something else.. <br />
otherwise 60 - 62 stuck in zones &lt; KT</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grendul3164</div><div class="date">08-12-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">60 is the minimum level for sewers/vxed/tipt. I know because when I was trying to level my zerker, I couldnt use Vxed like I was planning until then. <br />
<br />
If you really want to attempt the sewers, I would try the Pools. Mobs generally hit lighter and compare to a hard ldon.<br />
<br />
Id imagine the named mobs there hit the same as in the Lair expedition - 900+. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, for GoD hunting you could probably maintain steady killing in Natimbi (easy), Qinimi (pretty easy), Barindu (pulling singles), and Riwwi (colliseum camp). <br />
<br />
Riwwi has some great loot too...</div></div><hr />
