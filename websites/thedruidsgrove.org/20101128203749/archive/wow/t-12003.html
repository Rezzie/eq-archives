Finally got to know my Guild mates outside of typing.  Turns out most of them are pretty much like myself - Married w/kids.  THAT pretty much rocks.<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that I do find it a little distracting from the game.  Although, I think that will pass the more I get used to it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for those of you using Vent, what did you choose as your bind key for speaking?  I've used the left control button (my 4th choice), and I'm still not certain I like it.</div></div><hr />

The only time it gets dicey is when I'm trying on RP clothes (dressing room is also bound to the control key) while singing along with iTunes. Oops.<br />
<br />
I've heard the ` key (the one left of the number 1) is commonly used, but I didn't like it myself. Too much reaching when I'm doing other things, but I use the keyboard for turning/strafing a lot while I'm playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, you'll get used to being on Vent (or TS) as you do more of it. It seems that talking to people on Vent and developing relationships with your guildmates does a lot to enhance enjoyment of the game. I think it's one of the best burnout preventers around (see thread re: burned out). It's no wonder Blizz is incorporating it in a patch soon. I've made several RL friends within my guild; we even had a guild beach weekend in May. What a blast. A dozen of us in a beach cabin learning how to kite Grand Master Vorpil while drinking beer and eating pizza. Good times.</div></div><hr />

I use Left Alt ( Left Control for a whisper channel to a select few people ) and it works out pretty well.</div></div><hr />

Apparently, it's quite disorienting :ohwell: <br />
<br />
I've been tinkering around with it, and it's improved a little, but still happening.<br />
<br />
Can't seem to pinpoint this problem under the troubleshooting section of vent.  Does this sound familiar to any of you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had it happen an few times with guildies who use speakers rather than headphones while on TS.  And Vent.  and Skype.  and...<br />
<br />
The headphones direct the sound to your ears where the mic can't pick it up for feedback to the players.<br />
<br />
And if you've got a 5 button mouse (or even 3 button) I'd recc setting one to the speak button.  Unless of course you don't use the mouse much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I do. It's easier for me as it's right there next to my hotkeys, so I can do whatever needs doing, while talking.</div></div><hr />

Here's how: <br />
Go to Setup <br />

Enable Direct Sound <br />
Select the SFX Button <br />
Select Compressor and click Add. <br />

Under Compressor Properties use the following settings <br />
Gain = Adjust for how loud you want people to be. (I use 9) <br />
Attack = 0.01 <br />
Release = Around 500 <br />
Threshold = Around -30 <br />

What I've found amusing is that...<br />
<br />
Half my guild picked up vent normalization 1-2 months ago, due to a few guildies saying how great it was. However, around the same time, I started &quot;dissolving into static&quot; on vent when I talked, according to a good portion of the guild--which was odd, as my mic had worked fine the day before and some people could still hear me. Weeks later (no one noticed the parallel changes; and now, I was needed to talk on Vashj for Tainted Cores, so they couldn't have me without a mic [I had resigned myself to typing in raid chat]), they figured out that if they turned it off, they could hear me.<br />
<br />
Really strange.</div></div><hr />

Thanks!  Gonna give that a try.  Hopefully it will work.   And if what happened to Veriden happens to me, I will just undo it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to unbind auto-run to the right thumb button.<br />
<br />
Although my on-board soundcard is hooped right now so I can't talk...it's really getting annoying.<br />
<br />
Luckily I type very quickly.</div></div><hr />

Ventrilo might seem a bit of a distraction at first but pretty soon you'll come to appreciate the advantages it has over typing...especially in many PvE encounters and group/organized PvP.</div></div><hr />
