I heard a nasty rumor that blizz stealth nerfed expertise. Meaning bosses who parry you, will no longer retaliate 40% faster on their next hit. I know this isn't a nerf in regards to game difficulty, but it seems to nerf the utility of one of my favorite indirect tanking stats. :(</div></div><hr />

I'm not a hundred percent sure.  I got into a huge debate with someone a while ago pre 3.1 and there were still some parry thrashing.  <br />

Either way, it's not really nerfed in that expertise -&gt; less parries/dodgies -&gt; more threat.   <br />
<br />
It's still a good tanking stat because you will always be in front of the boss.</div></div><hr />
