<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aracnoid</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little help here.  I realize that FT1 is a very important effect.  However, I find it too much that an FT1 item would cost 35k++++ !<br />
<br />
I mean, there are other mana-saving stuff out there which costs less, e.g. mana preservation IV.<br />
<br />
Also, FT1 only gives 1 mana per tick, so 10 mana per minute.  If one were to relate that to a, let's say, 250mana nuke (for illustration purposes only), then you can visualize the benefit of the additional 1 mana per tick this way -- said additional benefit will allow you to regain the 250 mana you used after 25 minutes!  (I am simplying, but it illustrates the marginal benefit nonetheless.)<br />
<br />
Am I missing something or is FT1 just way too over rated?  Anyone else feels this way about FT1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grundular</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing about FT is that it is stackable. With FT15 it's like walking around with permanent KEI that you can put KEI on top of!<br />
<br />
But I agree with you, mana preservation 4 is better than FT1, 2, or 3 because the times that the proverbial crap hits the fan is when you'll need to toss lots of spells at once and FT won't do much for you during those few intense moments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's all relative, people charge what the market will bear and all, but with FT, you REALLY have to talk about specific items, rather than generic FT1, etc, since there are relatively few droppable FT items, and they have varying rarities which affect the price.  Then there are various MQable items which also have FT.  And then for items which also have other stats besided FT, those have to be taking into account as well.<br />
<br />
The cheapest FT in the game is definitely a horse or drogmor.  If you use it to the fullest (i.e. never move), it equivalent to FT20 below level 63 (FT19 at 63, FT18 at 65), and the cheapest model costs 8k, so that's 400pp per FT, not too shabbyy =)<br />
<br />
The PotC earring quest can be done for about 5kpp, and that's FT1.<br />
<br />
7th/8th shawls are FT1/3, and they are relatively cheap, considering the level your tradeskills need to be at are not too outrageous.<br />
<br />
Ornate wrists are FT2 and 40kpp on my server, so now we are talking about more per FT.  Spiritmaster war beads, FT2, 50kpp, Boots of Flowing Slime, 80kpp for FT3.<br />
<br />
So pick off the cheaper ones first, they are actually a pretty good deal.<br />
<br />
And if the choice is either MP or FT, definitely go with the MP, unless the FT is a horse and you don't already have one.  If MP saves you 5.5% base mana, you have to cast 3000 base mana per minute (which is almost impossible to do) to save 165 mana.  You can gain more than that much mana back having the horse.  Of course, if you don't fight outdoors much, that changes the decision a bit.<br />
<br />
So in general, horse, then MP, then other FT.<br />

That's pretty cheap, and always on (even when you die - unlike gear).</div></div><hr />
