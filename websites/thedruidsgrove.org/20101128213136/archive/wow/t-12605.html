<br />
That makes it an insta-cast regrowth, not sure if you are able to make a macro to shift out, regrowth and shift back. I would think not, since casting regrowth would initiate the global cooldown. But still it's only 1 second, so maybe you lagged or just missed it.</div></div><hr />

But it's very, very fast.</div></div><hr />
