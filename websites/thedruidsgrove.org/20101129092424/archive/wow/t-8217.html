<br />
Also a good fishing spot for Firefins.  Ive tried Menthil Harbor, but usually takes about 1+ hours to get a stack of em with 180 fishing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Menethil is the only place I've run into Firefins so far, and I agree with the ratio, but it seems to be hit and miss.  I got five in a row, but then nothing for twenty minutes.<br />
<br />
For stranglekelp, the most consistant place I've found it is usually in the waters of Darkshore, near Auberdine and the various dead sea creatures north of there.  Even then, it's only about one or two stranglekelp per football field's worth of water.  The area near the two ships for the &quot;Deep Sea&quot; quest seemed to be pretty good if you don't mind murlocs.</div></div><hr />

As for firefins, again, only place i found them was menethil.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">12-14-2004, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Menethil to be the best place to get firefin at the moment until they turn high level fishing back on.  I think Booty Bay was where I typically got it in beta.<br />
<br />
As for Stranglekelp, the tips above are all fine, and one thing also to bear in mind is that herbs always reappear in the same general areas.  There are limited nodes that they can spawn at.  So best possible advice is to swim along a coast and note all the positions of stranglekelp you pull, and then just revisit those specific areas of water.  Check on places like Thottbott for a good idea of where to start your search(Darkshore, SV, Ashenvale, Wetlands, Westfall, etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a few sets of murlocs that wander, but they're easily killed/evaded depending on yer mood... I generally start right north of the GY (which is just north of Menethil) and swim all the way north till I zone... I go in a zig-zag pattern so that I catch anything on my radar<br />
<br />
Once I get all the way up north, I get on the shore, travel form, and run back south to Menethil.  I pick up usually 5-6 Liferoot along the way (sometimes more, sometimes less).  Once I get back at the GY, I hop in the water and start my way north again... usually most everything has respawned in different locations but I can still get about 9-10 per pass (south to north)</div></div><hr />

There seems to be perhaps 10 or 11 Stranglekelp Nodes in that one channel, allthough you swim the whole length of Hillsbrad.</div></div><hr />

Just use the horde flight path that is right there, jump into water form and swim around.  There a few monster but with water form most can be avoided or run away from.  Normally I end up with 25 kelp in an hour or less.</div></div><hr />

If no one has emptied them, and they are all up, you can get three or four per node and there are 3-4 nodes. Just cast your line into the whirlpool. If it randomly lands someplace else just recast until its inside. I've only cought one thing inside the whirlpool that wasn't a firefin, and that was a bloated fish that gave up an aquamarine. Ocasionally one of the whirlpools changes type to an oily blackmouth school, but that is fine with me :)<br />

Tons of stranglekelp there.  All up and down the coast for that matter.  Wetlands is great for herbs in general, actually.</div></div><hr />
