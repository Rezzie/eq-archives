So,  I'm not going to be around much.  Never have time to do these forums from home.  I will check in from time to time, especially after XMAS when I get WoW back.<br />

Let me tell you how much better life got after I graduated college, where I could sleep in till noon, party till 3, surf all day, hang out with beautiful girls and occasionally go to class:  Now, I wake up at 6, work 9 hours, sit in 45 min of rush hour traffic both ways, never have time to surf, barely have time to play wow (I sacrafice sleeping for this simple vice - 6 hours a night is now the standard, half of what I would like) hang out with a bunch of 45-50 year olds that have worked for the same company for 25 years and have no ambition nor desire in life to become anything other than what they have always been.<br />
<br />
... Ah Life is Good.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Merry Christmas.</div></div><hr />

Just because you graduate doesn't mean WoW life is over....haha!  I just got my master's a year ago....and I still play WoW.  Since I'm not very busy at work I read the forums then....and play at home some.  What's great is I have friends over some weekends....and we just play WoW together.  We have some great times....and it looks like our group will be growing....haha!</div></div><hr />
