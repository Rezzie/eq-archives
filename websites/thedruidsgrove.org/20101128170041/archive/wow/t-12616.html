Berserk!!! (51 point Feral Talent)  -- Instant -- Remove stun, fear, etc. for 20s --  5 min cooldown.  Nice!<br />
<br />
Move Feral Charge down you can't pick it up with 11 points.  Move FFF up.  Also looks like there may be more separation between Cat and Bear specs.</div></div><hr />

Now fixed.  I assume this was done to nerf Resto's in arena's.  I also read that Feral Charge will now work in Cat form as well.  Which makes it a bit too powerful as a 11-point talent.</div></div><hr />

Unlike today's Feral tree in which you can take just about every &quot;good&quot; talent, the new tree requires that you make some choices.  And/or give up points in other trees.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see how this plays out...</div></div><hr />

Taking all the good talents is going to be a bit rougher.</div></div><hr />

I did read somewhere that Tiger Fury will cost 0 energy but have a cooldown (might have to add it to my bar if that happens).  And that resilience no longer &quot;works' in instances.

Maybe I'm blind but I'm not seeing anything like that :(<br />
<br />
- Reinforced Hide: reduce spell dmg by 10% &amp; additional 10% increase to armor contribution by items<br />
<br />
- Primal Precision: Increases your expertise by 10, and you are refunded -60% of the energy cost of a finishing move if it fails to land.<br />
<br />
- Berserk: Removes all Stun, Fear, Snare and Movement Impairing Effects and increases your energy regeneration rate by 100% while in Cat form, and increases your total health by 20% while in Bear form. After the effect ends, the health is lost. Effect lasts 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
- Improved Mangle: Reduces the cooldown of your Mangle (Bear) ability by -20%, and reduces the energy cost of your Mangle (Cat) ability by -6.<br />
<br />
- Infected Wounds: Your Shred, Maul and Mangle attacks have a 100% chance to cause an Infected Wound in the target. The Infected Wound reduces the movement speed and casting speed of the target by 10%. Stacks up to 5 times. Lasts 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
- Primal Aggression: Increases the critical strike chance of your Maul and Shred abilities by 5%.<br />
<br />
Nothing there about defense unfortunately.  Assuming the math for crit chance from bosses stays the same, we're going to have to stack about the same amount of defense ( beyond the level cap ) that we do now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FWIW, the talent tree has not been removed at Blizzard's request.  Obviously, the above is subject to change.  Some of the changes seem a bit to IMBA (especially the Balance and Resto changes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vencoris</div><div class="date">05-22-2008, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both parts were boosted<br />
<br />
Spell 33856<br />
Name: Survival of the Fittest<br />
Description: Increases all attributes by 6% and reduces the chance you'll be critically hit by melee attacks by -6%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also Mark of the Wild and Thorns saw very large gains<br />
<br />
Spell 48469<br />
Name: Mark of the Wild<br />
Description: Increases the friendly target's armor by 750, all attributes by 37 and all resistances by 54 for $d.<br />
Description2: Increases armor by $s1, all attributes by $s2 and all resistances by $s3.<br />
<br />
Talented it would be 1050 armor, 52 to all attributes and 75 all resists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell 46766<br />
Name: Thorns<br />
Description: Thorns sprout from the friendly target causing 140 Nature damage to attackers when hit. Lasts $d.<br />
Description2: Causes $s1 Nature damage to attackers.<br />
<br />
Talented (with brambles) it would be 245 damage per hit (and have a 15% chance to daze the attacker), that is a huge boost to the viability of thorns.</div></div><hr />

All in all it really feels too powerful to be honest. Of course all the other classes will probably get beefed up as well. Just don't plan on seeing all this at release.</div></div><hr />
