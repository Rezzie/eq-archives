It actually is really annoying. (Did solo the crimson oracle when Allies accidently ran into the group. I call it perfect timing as I was disguised as a crusader at that time.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can be helpful, but it really cheapens the experience IMO.  I always preferred an appropriate level group when going through an instance to make it more exciting than bringing a ringer or two and just picking up loot.  I also feel guilty when I am the one being helped because my friend could be advancing his own character and goals instead of helping me.<br />

Now once or twice while leveling I offered tips to high level players if they would help me take out an elite quest objective I was stuck on or something, but that was a rarity.</div></div><hr />

Since taking up a Night Elf Druid I have completed quests in far flung places that have taken me hours to find , aquatic quest took over 7 hours real time, and it has revitalised WoW for me.</div></div><hr />

Hehe.... hey gwmort, when I read this initially I thought you meant 'tips' as in advice.  It conjoured up a surreal image for a moment or two until I regained my senses!</div></div><hr />
