Some of them do-able and others well, shall we say have taken a toll on my experience bar.  I'm curious to see what others have been able to do or what mobs we could possibly do.<br />
<br />
It feels great when your guild kills one of the big mobs for the first time.  The next best thing to this is probably taking on a mob that many say you can't take on by yourself, sure its not good experience, but its the challenge =)<br />
<br />
Here are the rules:<br />
<br />
No outside assistance from other classes during the fight!  <br />
<br />
This means you can obtain buffs such as symbol, focus, kodiacs, brells and rune prior too the fight and pull.<br />
<br />
This does not mean you can have a shaman/enchanter slow/tash/malo the mob before you engage it.<br />
<br />
You can use zoning/egress to help you single the mob but not zone/root/dot.<br />
<br />
You may not use npc mob assistance rules to help.  (I.E. training giants in GD to the dwarven guards by Thurgadin type of thing)<br />
<br />
Dire Charm is not allowed. Though regular charming is allowed.<br />
<br />
Almost all clickables allowed.<br />
<br />

Think the hardest battle so far has been Doom which was the closest with barely surviving at 234 hp.<br />
<br />
I encourage any druid who is looking for a challenge to give these a shot.  <br />

And if you have any other suggestions for mobs to test your mettle against, please include them =)  Include whether they summon or not, and level!!!<br />

Greater Saphro almost doesnt qualify though he is really too easy.<br />

PoM - if it was worth going to - had some good summoning mobs to play with. The first two sets of halflings in Alice. Second set summoned, first didnt if I recall correclty. Its been a while.<br />

I was so close to dying, but after it was all said and done and I looted that splintered club, it was all worth it...  The feelings I felt then were nothing short of amazing… To bad a second later a wasp to put a damper on it all killed me while I was cheering…</div></div><hr />

I thought that named giant in East Karana was tough to solo because of his regen rate.  I wasnt fully prepared for him since he aggrod on me, but he was still a long, long kill.  Actually, hes not hard, he just takes a long time.<br />
<br />
I tried to solo the corrupted elysian just the other day, had to eggress like 3 times because of add's trying to pull him to a safe spot.  Got him down about 25%(his health at 75%) before he finally killed me.  I never did get him to a safe spot although i have to admit no adds came when he finally killed me.  On a side note, when i had a small train of disturbed elysians on me, i eggressed but didnt go anywhere.  The cool thing was the mobs all started to walk away like it worked.  Only wish i knew how to do it again )<br />
<br />
I've been thinking about trying to solo the Spire Lord in Mons Letalis(?), by just running him around the edges and either nuking or Doting.  Hes an easy solo pull but cant root or snare him.  <br />
<br />
I'd be alot more willing to try this stuff if i had a pocket cleric for resses, but i dont.  Sucks having to find a ress in a dead zone.</div></div><hr />

Will head back there once they fix some stuff =)<br />
<br />
As for SolB, a level 56+ druid should be able to break the room.  Mainly you need to root/dot 2-4 imps at a time so your ahead of respawn or if you have a fairly large mana pool frost nuke away.<br />
<br />
Magus Rokyl however, would be pretty hard getting him.  I just happened to be the only one in Naggy's lair waiting for Ragefire a while back.  It was a close fight too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malivolta</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Spire Lord in Mons Letalis was quite a challenge.  Pulling him can be difficult first off, since he has quite a few guards (although most green/lb).  Second, he is a SK so you gotta take the initial HT.  He flurries for 170ish, is unsnarable, and CAN snare you (although he doesn't cast that often.<br />
<br />
   To defeat him you must charm mature rockhoppers, while avoiding adds from spire spirits, thousands of stonegrabbers, and those annoying hatchling things.<br />
<br />
    Letalis is really a worthless zone for anything else than just having fun tryin to get this guy.</div></div><hr />

Still ain't easy.   Soon as ya get back in casting range he starts summoning ya.  I can't imagine how I'd do it without zoning for a breather.<br />
<br />
I never would have thought to solo 1/2 of those things... Warlord in FG?  Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abru</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the things I've solod:<br />
<br />
Ice Burrower in WW<br />
Captain Bvellos in Kael<br />
Bjorak Stonefist (60) in Kael<br />
Bridge Keeper camp in Chardok (survived Iksar Betrayer with two adds, not counting the dog I charmed)<br />
<br />
The first three things are mostly just about throwing the dice, though.  I've had a back-door escape for Bjorak, in the form of my 56 mage twink which can summon me if the pet breaks at he wrong time.  That's a much faster recovery option than drag/rez/rebuff.<br />
<br />
There's a more complete list in my Magelo Bio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abru</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Spire Lord is pretty easy once you get him down.  Load up your 3 second MR nuke, pull to north wall, kite back and forth.  No need to deal with any guards -- they won't assist if they don't see you.  Just lev off the platform after targetting The Spire Lord, nuke him once, and hang out down below until he's run down the stairs.<br />
<br />
Dire charm on a Mature Rockhopper or regular charm on an Ancient Rockhopper also works, and can involve less running around.  Also, if you clear out the lord's adjacent guards, you can agro kite him while your pet tears him up -- this is a good option if all you have is a Mature Rockhopper who may or may not survive.  There are some pathing issues, but it's not too bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My attempt that got him to 25% without zoning was mostly due to my 84 point damage shield (druid ds, coldain ring, shaman potion, bladecoat, lava diamond) and 65 hp regen a tick, and few lucky crits on Chloroblast.<br />
<br />
Most of these I did pre-focus items.  I imagine the speed-cast and increased dd focus items would help a lot.<br />

As for the Warlord, I was bored, had enough xp to keep 60 with a few deaths,  and no raids planned that night, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Figuring out the fight and how to pull is a large part of the fun.  Takes some creativity some times but can be as simple as summoning/charming a pet and letting it hack away while you aggro kite it.<br />
<br />
I'd like to say that most of these things can be done by a standard level 60 druid.  Though I would be lying if I said my equipment didn't make a difference, though of course I wish I had a lot better equipment (/dreams for the equipment Abru's wearing :P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can do it now. <br />
<br />
Best to do it solo anyway as they just charm you and stand there and when charm breaks you nuke.<br />
<br />
Load up on MR gear, start with Winged Death, nuke nuke loot.<br />
<br />
Charm is an absolute joke if you are solo as all it does is make their death take longer. At 60 with 180+ mr they still charm me 30% of the time but who cares. The mr is more for the nukes to be resisted.</div></div><hr />

But I'm sure any others that might happen by would feel otherwise. It's not often PCs in Cobalt Scar are prepared for a level 60 druid to start nuking them out of the blue. ;-P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abru</div><div class="date">03-29-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Though I did get snare to stick once, you generally can't snare an ice burrower, at least not without some debuffing help.<br />
<br />
They can stun you and proc a single dispell, though you can get two of them in one round since they double hit.  Keep two insta-click buffs on top, if not three.<br />
<br />
Kite it along the edge of the zone.  North side works well for me, as does west side.  Try to avoid dogs, as that's just more junk you'll have to kite around, and they run faster than the ice burrower, so you have to snare them.<br />
<br />
Bring your fungi and ring 10 if you can, so you don't have to use mana to heal yourself.  Get fresh c3.  It'll be a long kite, even with that.<br />
<br />
Load up scoriae.  Longer casting nukes won't work unless you want him hitting you for a couple bubbles of health in the middle of your cast.<br />
<br />
Using pets on ice burrowers just seemed like an excercise in futility, though I did get one pet to stay on the ice burrower even after he dispelled charm.  I'm assuming that requires a double attack with a dispell on both attacks, so that the pet gets hit once while not charmed.  Even so, anything you can charm doesn't have nearly the hps that an ice burrower has.  You'd have to line up a lot of pets to make that work.<br />
<br />
I also duod an ice burrower with a necromancer, which was a lot more fun than solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no time for epic, no times for dots, the only thing you could really do is DS yourself toss a heal and get ready for more beating. I dont recommand this unless you have a good AC.<br />
<br />
My root last 30 sec max or sometimes 1 min and it surprise me, its not a level question, im 60. And for AC I got a little over 1000 AC and I still get good beatings from these mobs, they sure not hit max everytime but it hurts on the long run.</div></div><hr />

Dont even have to worry about charm since our dots have a longer cast range than her nukes.  <br />
<br />
In SG, is harder, no room to run really.  havent tried it solo, might do that.<br />
<br />
I almost took out the last guy for the Shield of Bane warding quest-he is unsnareable/unrootable, summons, heals, gates.  had him down to 10%ish, he gated and healed back to 50%, got him back down and repeated this twice and just didnt have the mana to finish him off before he finished me.  i did have a 50 shaman helping but his spells didnt stick, besides the first slow, that wore off long before the first gate.  btw wouldnt recommend trying this w/o backup waitng to finish the quest so you dont have to restart with no reward =)<br />
<br />
I did the grimling fight of that quest solo too-possessed grimling is unsnareable/unrootable with three dinky skeletons.  just took awhile.  pretty dull.<br />
<br />
I have done the efreeti run, but never actually gotten to the efreeti before i chickened out.  also have done the rest of the level 1 mobs w/ exception of sirens IN SG.<br />
<br />
Killed some Xi Vius in Maidens eye, those buggers are a pain.  level 56ish but dont summon, healers suck =)<br />
<br />
i tried a lotus plant in FG once (those summon) got it down to 30% and decided i couldnt finish so gated out.  anyone else had luck with these?<br />

btw would be interested in knowing what the hardest thing scirocco has done is =)  he always comes up with interesting tactics its seems.</div></div><hr />

I ran around and kited him for the better side of an hour while I root-n-rotted while medding.  Nothing like casting Winged Death and not seeing his health visably move after it's worn off.<br />

I was determined to solo the rings to 7 and had this one 100%MR unsnareable giant to kill. It took me about 30mins running around EW throwing charmed mammoths and rhinos at him, I have no idea how many he munched through but it was at least 5 and prolly closer to 10. Snare aggro was only working for so long on each pet, eventually he would turn and rip em up no matter how close I got.</div></div><hr />

Charming a mammoth then just running him around, nuking when mammoth got aggro and so on.<br />
When charm broke I just rooted mammoth, ran a bit and then recharmed and ran Warden in rings around the mammoth.<br />
So fun. ;)  <br />

Warden Bruke was easy for me...

<br />
   Corrupted/Tainted Seahorse: I think this could be done with charm, and I know that the swirlspines are charmable if you can get one with you.  These don't hit that hard either, but do CHeal of course.  And of course this isn't the best of zones to die in =)<br />
<br />
   Cazel: Seems doable, although I think the massive regen on him might pose a problem.<br />
<br />
   Faydedar: I'm sure everyone knows the old exploit to kill him solo (which I won't mention so people don't get try it and get banned), but I wonder the feasibility of aggro kiting him using raptors as pets.  The major problem here is his AE dispell/nuke, etc. would pose a problem.  I don't think this could be done legit.  <br />
<br />
  I'll add more later as I think of 'em.  <br />
<br />
 P.S. - Revisited my old epic friends and can now add corrupted/tainted brownie to list, as well as corrupted seafury.  Was really bored =p.  The corrupted brownie wasn't as tough as I thought he might be solo.  I loaded up burst of flame in case he rooted me, although he never did.  Moonfire took him out in short fashion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   I had a level 1 gnome friend pull him to the zone after I buffed him up.  The King is either a wizard or a mage, I can't really determine.  He casts mage spells im pretty sure, he just doesn't have a pet.<br />
<br />
   He hardly resists any spells.  Snare landed easily, and so did root.  My nukes did full damage, no need for Ro's.  I'd estimate his HP at around 32k, since after 3 nukes I could see his hp move a fairly significant amount for a level 60 mob.  At level 60 (me) the only thing that would assist him is his clockwork guard, who will usually go back to camp first since the King casts his DS on everything in the train.<br />
<br />
    The way he got me was due to not being prepared mainly.  He dispelled me early in the fight, and I lost SoE and PotG.  He then got off a lucky nuke for 550ish, after landing mainly weak 100s or less previously.  When I tried to egress he summoned me before I got it off, and I had to run to recast, but accidentally ran under a low ceiling making me duck, causing me to get summoned once again to my death. =p<br />
<br />
   I'll try him again today, with KEI and some HP buffs to be safer.</div></div><hr />

   King Akanon taken down solo... sorta.  Had my bard friend there just for a safety net and he sang Nivs + Mana.  Guess that doesn't count as solo, but he didnt do any damage otherwise.  Loot was sprocket, rune of astral, and some other worthless thing.  Minor faction hit, stayed dubious with him (respawn is fast).<br />
<br />
  Mayor Gubbin taken out completely by myself.  He is extremely easy, only level 50 ranger I believe.  The tricky part was pulling him, as his building has 3 warrior guild leaders in it.  Once I pulled him, he died extremely fast.  <br />
   I definetly don't suggest killing him though, took me from ally to dubious with almost every single halfling faction there!  Went to amiable with goblins.  He dropped some rune and Goblin warbeads. ;/<br />
<br />
   Just gonna stay on the safe side and not wipe out the dwarf king, in case he gives a major hit.  Next plan is to take out the DE King... that should be a true challenge.</div></div><hr />

Dire charm a bronto and park it somewhere, go get an IB and cast ensnare on it lots.  It usually takes a half dozen tries to get it to stick, even after Glamour.  Then snare it a bunch more times on the way back to pet, and run in circles just outside the burrower's reach chain casting snare or flame lick or whatever you like.<br />
<br />
You can dummy buff the pet a bit too add a safety, but it shouldn't swing at the pet unless you get too far away.  Takes forever to kill one tho, even with a hasted 146 hitting bronto, heh.  BTW, Tantor doesn't seem to be aggro-kitable, he'll turn and kill your pet unless you are also in melee range, and you don't want to be there too much.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Not really.  You just need to watch an enchanter, shaman or necro in action... or see the hassle a druid goes through to fight phinny then realize that a wizard can wipe him with one manaburn, 4 wizards can waste a kunark dragon, and a shaman can solo Lodi and could probably take a chunk out of Innorouk.  Let me know when a druid solos Lodizal.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Though I did get snare to stick once, you generally can't snare an ice burrower, at least not without some debuffing help.&quot;<br />
 <br />
  I haven't fought IBs in a while but when I did snaring them had absolutly no effect on movement.  Did this get changed when they fixed phase spiders and vellium hounds?<br />
 <br />
&quot;The hardest mob I've ever soloed was Vluudeen in the Great Divide. Nasty wurm smacked me upside the head as I was medding and at 40% mana. He was blue to me at level 58, so I said, &quot;why not?&quot;. Little did I know that he had like 32k hp :/&quot;<br />
 <br />
  16khp, just killed it today.  Was at half from 3 minutes of drones/winged/epic before I got bored and nuked it.<br />
 <br />
  Interesting thread, but for the original message... anything that doesn't summon that you have room to play with and you can keep rooted long enough to have a net gain of mana you can kill.  And every caster class gets root but magicians (who have an earring or ring from CT) and the hybrids except SKs.  Root is the defining spell for druids, what we can root we can probably kill, that which we can't, we probably can't.  The only class to really break that is shamans because their slow (Turgur's) beats ours (Ensnare) shamelessly and enchanters for the same reason + charm lets them beat even most summoning mobs given some luck.<br />
 <br />
  So only the summoning or unrootable (and high hp) mobs are really interesting kills, everything else just takes time.</div></div><hr />

Not every druid is going to be able to do it, nor crazy enough to try most of these things.<br />
<br />
Oh sure, I can solo Ydelma, it'll take me an hour or two of prepping, getting the pull right, whereas I can group with a 60 shaman and get it killed in less then 10 minutes and 5 minutes later go take another nest dragon on.  There's a difference.<br />
<br />
A warrior can't solo a nest dragon but team up with a 60 cleric, wow, they'll have that mob dead in less then 10 minutes as well.  Team the warrior up with a 60 shaman with Torpor and malo, that dragon is dead in less then 5. <br />
<br />
It's called EFFICIENCY.  By far group efficiency outpars anything a druid can do solo with far less risk.<br />
<br />
Just like your standard uber mob raids.  Wow, you can kill Vindicator with 18! How long did it take you? Nearly 30 minutes.  Whereas you take 45ish people and Vindicator is dead in 5 minutes.  Plus quicker to clear to too.<br />

<br />
Umm, maybe.  I see no irony.  EQ was designed to be a social game, organized around big raids in the end game.  Druids are plainly broke in this area.  The fact that they CAN solo some top end mobs has nothing to do with it.  The petition didn't ask for any help in soloing, or even XP groups, just in the area of raids.  And, as has also been pointed out, Druids aren't even close to being the top soloers at level 60.<br />
<br />
OK, so broken for raiding at level 60.  Can solo some tough mobs, but not even as well as some other classes, and those classes also aren't broke for top end raids.<br />
<br />

<br />
Of course the real irony is the dramatic irony going on, where the events unfolding are understood at a different level by the audience (non druids) than the characters (the druids).<br />
<br />
But what the hell do I know I only played a paladin and a druid to 45; my opinion doesn't count.</div></div><hr />

Also willing to warn for the mobs list: <br />
- yvolcan is snare/ root immune and no longer summons<br />
- Bulthar heardleader no longer summons neither, and couldnt land snare or root on it (tried like 20 times :p ) no immune message though.<br />
- Efreeti is piece of cake himself, clearing the way to the room is another game. Imps hit for up to 125 and got very high RM, wasting tons of mana and making the fight dangerous.<br />

I'd be curious to see a druid soloing Phinni with no external help at all, that means none to kill his guards.<br />

Strictly druid only buffs, start with zero buffs on you and FM, and go from there; all clickable items are allowed regardless of if they cast spells that are not druid castable. Potions are allowed - this includes the Wisdom buff potion as well as the clarity potion. Zoning during the fight is discouraged, but if you use zoning as part of your tactic please note that as well as any potions you used in your kill list.<br />
<br />
So, with those restrictions in mind, what are suggestions for mobs? As Allis noted, Yvolcarn no longer summons, though he is still in the unsnareable/unrootable category, so deserves a spot on the list.<br />

Lvl 60 dwarf for kromrif military leggins quest. Low resists, open area, summons, not many adds.. nice training. Didnt use other buffs than mines, started with 40% mana and been a like 40mn fight.<br />
<br />
I definately have to try FGs in solB :)</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that he does not summon.  Since I'm kos to CoV, I pulled him over to the south shore where there are very few wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
He's MR as hell, but I managed to get ensnare to stick after about ten tries... after that I just charmed and hasted a mammoth and agro kited Stronghorn...  Took about 20 minutes, think I had to recharm mammoth twice.<br />
<br />
Hardest part was getting Stronghorn to the south shore without adds... Actually did get a couple of Wyvern adds during the fight, but a mammoth with 77% haste &gt; Wyvern Hunters... =)<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks for suggesting that Tantor and Stronghorn might not summon.  If I hadn't seen that I might never have tried it, and that was one of the most fun fights I've had outside a raid in a LONG time =)<br />
<br />
Made a guild warrior pretty happy too... dropped the horn =)<br />

<br />
I can also confirm that Tantor doesn't summon, but it would take me forever to kill him, as I couldn't land anything on him, and it would have to all be pet work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i personally never got him snared, chose to go high speed charming, but i saw a druid get him snared after about 6-7 tries once he tashed.<br />
<br />
that would make the whole i way i did it trivial haha.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Luclin time sink key shard/bane/emperor/seru/shissar/acrylia camps!.   I am thinking of doing some crazy pulling though once I get my chardok faction up to ally with the help with the help of a rogue or two.<br />

Something along the lines of pulling the Overking or Queen in Chardok to zone in type of thing</div></div><hr />

Okay, not sure if you've seen him before, but in WW there is a wolf named Icehackle. Very comparable to Tantor - same hp, hits just as hard, rampages. Difference is that Tantor is non aggro and runs a little slower than sow, whereas Icehackle is aggro and runs as fast as soe.<br />
<br />
Total kite time: 49min<br />
Spells Cast: 40-45 Casts of Wildfyre, 5-8 casts of Scorae, 5-7 casts of Ro's Fiery Sundering, 3-7 casts of Nature's Recovery, 3 casts of Regrowth, 2 casts of Chloroblast, and whatever buffs I had on at the time.<br />
<br />
His MR is higher than Tantor's I think. Even with our MR debuff I failed on about 15 snare tries and ended up kiting him with my horse (stuns HURT when you are on a horse, see the pics).<br />
<br />
As stated above, I used the druid only buff rule, and used no potions. The only castable item I used was the ToV bp for free casts of Regrowth.<br />

As usual, no buffs other than mine, didn't use any potions either. Tried to snare him but even with Glamour on him he resisted over 60 casts of snare (I spent 40min trying to snare him).<br />
<br />
Fight duration: 4 hours 40min<br />
Wildfire's cast: 117, 9 of them resisted. Ro 1 on him at all times, with avg dmg per cast of 570.76 and a total damage dealt of 66769.<br />
<br />
Was my first time trying him (never even tried him with KEI before), so made a few bad mistakes that cost me lots of time. First time I got him to &quot;Tan&quot; and he warped and jumped up to 50% life again, which is why the total damage is much higher than just his normal hp + regen.<br />
<br />
Very fun fight without chanter buffs; hoping to take another pass at it sometime next week to improve my time.</div></div><hr />

Worked for me - bit of a shame to spoil the tactics for it though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kahlus</div><div class="date">05-26-2002, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't use pets actually. Two reasons why:<br />
1) Never any up now that people slaughter animals to try to get hound furs for 8th shawl.<br />
2) Check safehouse - _supposedly_ the changes to WW to stop the dragon sploiting are gonna cause charmed pets to immediately taunt, thereby preventing aggro kiting with a pet.<br />
<br />
Go play with it. It's an absolute blast trying to figure out how to solo some of these guys. I spent an hour and a half &quot;learning&quot; Tantor before I found something that worked for me. And gear doesn't matter - I have no FT, my wis is under 255. AA doesn't matter either - I have mc1 and that's it. Heck my spec in evocation is only a 140 (which is one reason it took me so long to regen mana)<br />
<br />
My strat is probably very different than some of the others here since I don't use charm and I don't have KEI or clarity. Don't want to give it away since learning how to do it is half the fun.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Hmm, I've kited him before and he was definety much slower than SoE since I was able to go in circles and he couldn't even catch me.  Never saw him rampage.  Maybe there is a level 61 and a level 62 version.<br />
 <br />
  With the right peice of terrain to run him over (and WW certainly doesn't lack that) you should be able to get wildfires off without too much trouble.</div></div><hr />

Umm Stormy, I know I solo'd Vluudeen before you did with half your gear and no epic at level 56. 16K sounds about right.<br />

I saw Giladriel with a whip I wanted so I took and got it. :)  Nice dmg delay pre epic.<br />
