The closest flight path to there is in the blasted lands. The only way to do is stay on the road going east from duskwood it is a bit of a run you have to go through a pass can't remember the name, but stay on the northern part of that road as the souther part fork will take you to some mobs that will turn you into a snack :)</div></div><hr />

If you are an herbalist that swamp is a gold mine.</div></div><hr />
