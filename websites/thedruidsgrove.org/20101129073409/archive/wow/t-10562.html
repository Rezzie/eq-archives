I think 4 healers are more then enough tho'  (I think everything in this game other then farming is best done with a 2 healer per group ratio).<br />
<br />
When I lead UBRS runs (somone always needs an Ony key) I prefer the old school, straight up fight, take down the adds then kill the boss.  Usually have the main tank and 2 healers take Drak to the far side of the room and kill the adds at the spawn spot.  I prefer to have warlock(s) fear one add while we kill the second.  Failing having locks, then off tanking... if no off tank is aviable then hibernate.  Goblin Rocket helm works on these guys if you have an engineer with one.<br />
<br />
I don't like the hunter kiting technique... it just seems rather unessacry and if your hunter fails your raid is gonna prob wipe as your healers are gonna be who Drak comes running for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never actually wiped with the hunter kite method, probably cause I have been with a really good hunter almost every time.  Last time there was 1 priest and 4 druids (3 resto 1 moonkin), so while the hunter kited, I offtanked one of the adds, while everyone dps'd the hell out of my target.  As soon as that was down, I popped out and got to healing / nuking the other add, which we got to about 10% just as Drakk came back.  Killed him then took down Drak with only one death.  That was fun - healing, nuking and tanking in one fight.  <br />
<br />
The warlock double fear method is solid... I like that one too.  If you have an MC experienced group, its no big deal to pull drakk to the back corner, then kill the other two while drakk is being tanked by the MT with 2 healers.  Kind of like the Shazz fight.  Or a watered down Domo.<br />
<br />
You shouldnt need FR pots, though they will help for sure. Stick with it, you'll get him down soon :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was only my 2nd time to the General and 3rd run of UBRS total, so I don't feel too bad, but I really want to down this SOB.<br />
<br />
I got the dagger off The Beast last night which was pretty cool, but lost a roll on The Eye of Rend to a rogue /sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can do drakk many different ways.<br />
<br />
1. Hunter kite drakk, with the MT + DPS killing one guard while a lock fears the other or a druid sleeps.(A druid CAN sleep the guards if they are the level 59 ones). I've done this just today.<br />
<br />
2. Old school way, rush them all. You can kill in any order you want. I've done it where the guards died first or Drakk has. It all works. FR will not save you from 1k hits or 2.5k crits. If you get full aggro your as good as dead in most cases.<br />
<br />
3. With two group locks fear both guards and burn down drakk.<br />
<br />
4. With two tanks, have one OT Drakk while the group kills one guard and the lock fears the other. Druid can sleep if the guard is level 59.  <br />
<br />
Group make up wise i've always be one of the main healers. Normally it's just me, another druid or priest. Once in awhile we'll have a pally. But really two healers will work just fine, and the rest is DPS.<br />
<br />
FR is not needed for this encounter by everyone. Only the tank really needs FR. <br />
<br />
Something to note about this zone - The Beasts hide. If you skin and get the +10 skinning dagger only skin The Beast if your with your own guild. Do not skin it in a PUG. Why? If you do skin the beasts hide, the raid will bitch and moan on who gets it. It's better to just advoid the drama.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was joking ( sort of ) about sneaking in the additional 5 players through my backpack.  <br />
<br />
On our first attempt the hunter had never kited Drakk before and was nailed with conflag and died while the 2 guards were still up and...well...bad.  <br />
<br />
The 2nd attempt the hunter kited him well, but died just as we told him to let Drakk go.  So, we started a man down and then I think the healers didn't manage their mana well and went OOM too quickly.<br />
<br />
Looking back I probably should have slept the first guard while they took down the first, and helped heal and keep up dots on Drakk once the guards were down. <br />
<br />
Well, hopefully on my next run.... 0/2 on UBRS runs so far /sigh<br />
<br />
Been on 30+ runs of UBRS. I've failed on Drakk only about 6 times. And I have to note this...In my 30+ runs I've never seen a WH chest drop. <br />

That's just depressing....<br />

I got the dagger on the last run and have no problem skinning it and letting people roll.  I look at it like a disenchant and everyone gets a shot.  I'm pretty drama free ( at least in game ) ;).:clap:</div></div><hr />

I thought that all the Dragonkin after Ren were immune to sleep?  Did they change this in one of the patches? (Haven't been to UBRS in a while)</div></div><hr />

Which is exactly I gave up on the Wildheart set.  I have been on countless UBRS and LBRS runs, and never seen either the chest or shoulders.  Oh well, DireMaul gear straight to Cenarion ftw.</div></div><hr />

I've only run UD Strat like 2x and not gotten to the Barron yet, so I've only seen the kilt on other people ;)  The chest, well...I just want to down Drakk first, then I&quot;ll worry about the drop rate on the chest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You maybe...You can't say that about the other 9 people in your raid. It will cause drama in a pug.<br />
<br />
As for the Baron...He can go to hell as well. In 15-20ish runs on him never seen WH legs drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oddly enough, I was main healer for my group ( feral spec'd ) with a priest healing the other group.<br />
<br />
We lost someone just as we pulled to a disconnect, then the hunter died just before the 2nd guard was downed ( but Drakk had a decent run back so we were ok ).  I had about 200 mana at the end of the fight, but I am now BWL attuned ( not that I can run it though ) and got my Mark.  Brok 10k AC with this and the ring from the Battle of Darrowshire.  :D</div></div><hr />

I remembered Jimmay's post about sleeping a lvl 59. I told the group that I would CC the dragon. We pulled and I tried sleeping. Sure enough....he was completely immune. I ended up tanking him and healing myself lol. <br />
<br />
We still pwnt Drakk with the kite method since we only had 2 warriors. You need to get 2 warriors on Drakk asap because he has a conflag ability that sends the warrior running around for 5-10 seconds uncontrollably.</div></div><hr />

This is too hilarious!  On my 5+ runs and also the runs that my boyfriend did with some other groups....I have seen the WH chest  piece drop about 3 times....and no Devout!  Oh the irony!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basicly it works just like hunter kite but more effective least my what I have seen as our hunters always died.  Get Max range from drak.  Moonfire/Starfire Drak.  Turn and run to beast room do look back dont stop.  Drop to cat form ASAP and sprint.  You will easily out run drak to the beast room.  By the time you reach the beast's room drak will be just bit out of visual range turn and watch for him.  Soon as he appears move to your right to the far corner of the beasts room.  Drak will unagro off you just as he enters the beast room.  If he does not you should have time to kite him around the room by staying close to the wall and running him around the room.  Once you get back to the entrace to the beasts room return to draks room they should be ready for you by now.  The Second guard should be down by the time drak returns and I've only died doing this by being stupid and turning around to look or run back for him.   The nice thing about this is when you return the healer is ussually about ready for your innervate and you can DPS or heal at this point as well or even off tank drak.  Was quite fun doing as well.</div></div><hr />

Did a quick run LBRS to see good ol' Mother there, she owed me some spider silk ;-) (for my herb bag which I never bothered to make before) could easely swipe the packs of spiders. <br />
The orcs was almost doable with thorns only, imped LotP heal for more then the dmg they do lol<br />
