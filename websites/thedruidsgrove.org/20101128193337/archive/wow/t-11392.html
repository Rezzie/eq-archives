ME, i went all AGI on my ferral druid with all Cat ferral abilities.  I like the crits.  but is it hurting my overall dmg?  I need help lol.<br />
<br />
If i have to go str then i have wasted ALOT of time and money, but if its better, then so be it.<br />
<br />
please someone explain which is better, and not just with the answer &quot;str&quot; or &quot;agi&quot;</div></div><hr />

Basically it states that before 1200AP, STR will give you more AP (and more damage per point). At 1200AP, AGI will become equivalent and better as your AP rises.</div></div><hr />

I find that crits do much more for my dps at that point than increased attack power.  So much so, in fact, that I have started dumping strength gear/enchants in favor of more 'rogue-esque' pieces of gear.  Needless to say, my rogue compatriots are not thrilled, but they will survive!</div></div><hr />

The &quot;1200 AP Rule&quot; is rubbish that gets repeated so often that people come to accept it for fact. <br />
<br />
&quot;As your current crit% increases, the required amount of AP for Agility to become better than Strength becomes higher.&quot;<br />

<br />
Tangedyn has a DPS calculator here:<br />
<br />
http://tangedyn.9tribes.net/cat-dps/catdps-calc/<br />
<br />
Using that is the best way to determine, based on your current spec and equipment stats, what adding more AGI or STR will do for your overall DPS. Unfortunately the calculator hasn't been updated to include the 2.0 changes, but it's still valid for this purpose.</div></div><hr />
