Crypt of decay alternate access bypass of whatever that lifetap guy was that spawns adds on deaths, Bertoxx.  Rallos/tallon/vallon alternate access bypass.  Sol Ro bypass for plane of fire.

<br />
Khati Shi the Twisted - looks like there have been others working on this recently. But it's  a possibility.<br />
<br />
GBS - Just went through that - I think it's for Pally or Necro.<br />
<br />
remains of Vah Kerrath - doesn't seem too interesting and looks like it might be solved? Just lame?<br />
<br />
The quests for alt access to the planes, hmmm. I thought they were solved. I think I even did a couple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">01-28-2010, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doing the elysian skull quest, a whisperling would spawn, but, I could never target it, there are quite a few whisperlings running around luclin with the same issues.  After turning in a few elysian skulls, the whisperling would say something, if it was not just broken, which is a possibility, Cloak of Jaggedpine prompts would lead in a circle as well. <br />
<br />
Alot of the alternate access quests in Pop like the justice trial bypass, either were not put in, or were never found.  Most alternate acess quests to the elemental planes or bypassing flags were never found. Besides the kill Fennin Ro collect shield bypass, when piggied.  Like I do not mention Sol Ro Tower, because the efreeti quest, and the bypass quest to sol ro's chamber, those were found, the sol ro and rallos bypass for fire weren't.<br />
<br />
Ya, the Glowing black stone quest I am disappointed about.  The ties of ridossan's spirit to najena.  The various ridossan's armor quests in paineel seemed to fit.  Unless one of the high level heretics, well for the zone anyways are usuable outside of the Loy quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the ancient whisperling is just there to inform you of your faction. If when you get the message from the remains of Vah Kerrath to &quot;ask&quot; the ancient whisperling, just have no target and ask 'Am I worthy of Vah Kerrath's knowledge?'. If your faction is good enough the ancient whisperling will say &quot;. . . ask the bone man to tell you of Vex Thal.&quot; <br />
<br />
Then you can ask the remains of Vah Kerrath 'Tell me of Vex Thal.' Which is the start for the Medallion of Akelha Ra quest for Talisman of Vah Kerrath which requires the Soul Essence of Aten Ha Ra from Aten Ha Ra in VT.</div></div><hr />

Khati Shi the Twisted is a possability but I'm just a druid. I might look into it. But like I mentioned others have worked it in 2009 with no luck. <br />
<br />
Now the Tome of ages quest - sounds like many quests depending on the class. I did the Phylactery Will Get You Nowhere quest for Grand Tunic of the Oracle (one of my proud moments). Which sounds similar at first glance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">02-01-2010, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, Tome of ages is just a part of the Phylactery Will Get You Nowhere quest (for druids).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The raid even is listed on alla's, with rewards even. It may no longer function but it looks to have worked at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">02-01-2010, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khati Shi has been pretty sporatic the day Luclin shipped.  Something in his script almost always bugs out.  There is a quest related to Vah Shir that hints towards Khati Shi, it starts at low level, and gradually works up like the cudgel quests for Iksar in Kunark.  I don't believe it was ever finished do to the nature of Khati.<br />
<br />
Tome of ages hints, probably broken on purpose, later with the Phylactry quest I also completed, screw the mana crystals and sanguine tome by the way....... with the other books of turmoil and so on that the oracle says he is not looking for at this time.  People wonder if it was the old fiery avenger quest, but, the books were never found.  McQuaid always insisted that it was in the game.<br />
<br />
quote&quot;So not sure I want to get into the alt plane access quests if nobody has even found the starting point at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you know how long it took to find the ranger epic 1.5 bypass quest?<br />
I pretty much gave up on the justice trial bypass. Talked to all the prisoners, well the ones that were not Kos, didn't get to much in the way of go here collect 10 bear asses. Or in everquest terms go kill 1800 mobs or so, collect the drops on an ultra rare mob with an rare drop......<br />
<br />
I mispoke on the behemoth bypass quest, unfortunately no bypass the factory key, that quest is in if you did the tactics exp only quest, but killed rallos/vallon/tallon.  But, that kinda goes back to the justice trials bypass quests for storms and valor. And I forgot about the charm bangle quest for crypt access.<br />
<br />
Hmm, been awhile on Remains of Kerrath, he used to say stuff about the collecting silver chains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">02-03-2010, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the Khati Shi event in AC just aint working. I'm not too familiar with it and am still learning the exact script but I see that others have been trying it even as of this year 2010 and it just doesn't function. Sad.</div></div><hr />
