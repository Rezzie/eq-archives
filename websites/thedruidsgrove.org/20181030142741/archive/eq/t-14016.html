Grove was 10 regen and 4 disease counters, Life was 30 regen and 2 disease counters; per tick.  Following a farming of AMV in CoA, and most of the group died because we relied on Aura of the Grove, I looked into this further because prior to last night we were getting the Mark of Death cures accomplished with the level 55 Grove.  <br />
<br />
Well, there was a ninja swap unannounced in the 6/13 patch. Now, grove has 2 disease counters and life has 4 disease counters - per tick - and the regens have not changed.  It takes 14 disease counters to cure the AMV's Mark of Death.  Therefore, use Aura of Life on the AMV encounter.  Oh, and the group members that didn't die to the Mark last night were cautious enough to use counteract disease potions.<br />

Yes, I did just check the patch message; no meantion. Nice this was done, finally working as intended I guess, no thanks for no indication of the switch.<br />

According to Lucy, it was done on 3 15 2006, as seen in the effect Aura of Life Cure History:<br />

To assume that all druids check Lucy for spell changes after every patch or to require that they do so in order to be &quot;informed&quot; about spell changes is dumping that responsiblity elsewhere. SoE made the spell changes and SoE should have informed the player population of such in their patch message.</div></div><hr />

Tried to use the forums search function before the above meantioned AMV fight that evening with no dice, however.  &quot;Grove&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Aura of the Grove&quot;, and &quot;Aura of Life&quot; didn't work in the search.</div></div><hr />

Should have searched just &quot;aura&quot;.<br />
<br />
I posted quite a bit about this and also told everyone when it was 'fixed'.  Never got Sony to talk to me about it, they refused to confirm that it was fixed.<br />
<br />
I guess they just hate me because I asked Absor directly here and all Sony devs on the Sony board and was ignored by them both times.<br />
<br />
They are getting better with communication then they used to be but they still don't understand what it really means.<br />
<br />
Yup, the players are to be treated like mushrooms, kept in the dark and fed crap.</div></div><hr />

Sorry - no matches. Please try some different terms. <br />
<br />
The following words are either very common, too long, or too short and were not included in your search : aura</div></div><hr />

Sorry, guess some things are hard to search for.  Or maybe the search function here isn't the best.<br />
<br />
In any case, I hope the issue is clear now.</div></div><hr />

Just wouldn't want to rely on it and watch my group all die.  Thanks.<br />

Also, and this might not be the proper forum for it, but does anyone know the range on Auras?  100' 200' ?<br />

Thanks /huggles</div></div><hr />

Aura of Life does indeed cure the AMV death touch.  However, you must make sure that no other effect is above it.  Use resplendent cure to clear them if they are.<br />
<br />
Aura of Life will work first on whatever is the top most detrimental buff on you, so you will die if the death touch isn't the top most one.<br />
<br />
The range on auras sucks.  It is really bad.  However, it is fine for the AMV fight, assuming you have your raid force all together at the entrance, as my guild does it.</div></div><hr />
