<br />
I haven’t been doing this quest, and I’ve only read the last fourteen pages, but it seems to me as if the clues are pointing you back to the Rathe Mountains to do the combines.<br />
<br />
Geadin said that you must use the Soul Stone in the &quot;area where the owner of that head was killed.&quot;  Bouncer Flerb said &quot;Me find him coming out of da mountains so me bounce him into da river.&quot;  Flerb's bit doesn't necessarily mean that the man was walking out of the Rathe Mountains; it could mean that Flerb was walking back to the Feerott from Rathe and found the man, already dead, on the way back home.  Flerb also said that the &quot;Greenbloods eat him already,&quot; meaning most likely the Tae Ew, which are also present in Rathe.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://eqatlas.com/rathemtnsmap.html&quot;&gt;Areas 9, 21, and 22&lt;/a&gt; seem like a good place to start sniffing again to me, just using the clues.</div></div><hr />

P.S. I get the feeling that the Healing Notes may be used to start Epic 2.0. After finding out who is responsible for this new disease (epic 1.5), perhaps kill it (assuming the head belongs to his agent), I'm thinking epic 2.0 will be about curing it. Pure speculation of course ;)</div></div><hr />

I could not verify this as I couldn't find it on my server to test this mob out. It also despawns after it has been hailed according to the person I talked to. This might be worth checking into since this is in a zone we would not die in and fits with the unkempt druid stuff so far. Also I did not see a listing on Ala's for this mob as of yet.  <br />
Perhaps this spirit will appear now, if you have everything up to this point? <br />

&quot;guys our epic isn't bugged. I am like 5-6 turn ins past the mangled head&quot; to which Aerious of Quellious replied...&quot;Are you past the coven&quot;? <br />
 <br />
Hastfully I looked up the word &quot;coven&quot; on the dictionary.com. And i got this. Coven--noun-- an assembly of witches; usually 13 witches.<br />
 <br />
then i replied &quot;I am past the witches&quot; He told me that he spawned them. and that after killing just one of them the depopped. Hence the phrase &quot;our epic is bugged&quot; We need to use this to our advantage.<br />
 <br />
Sometime after the head is identified, there will be an event SPAWNED. Known as the coven. A coven is an assembly of witches. Usually 13 witches. Its possibly bugged. but lets move ! solve our epic!Would make sense, I guess, for witches to have a soul? A couple zones were said to have &quot;coven spawner&quot; on track through &quot;special tracking&quot;. Might be something to look for. ;)</div></div><hr />

this is the way they done the programming for him to go from will-not-attack to will-attack. the first version of him is non-kos in wolf form, the respawned version (after he hand you the item) is slightly higher level, LB to 66, and is KOS. got mad hp i tried kill him with no success<br />

<br />
Remember, the madman does NOT identify the head.  He simply gives us the soul gem.  We still need to identify the head.  And we need to do that by conversing with it.  That appears to require binding a soul of some sort in or with the gem in the head, then conversing with the head (i.e., getting text after a combine).<br />
<br />
And I'm not sure what you meant by repeating Niera's statement.  That's her response when you hand her the Healing Book that you get from the Gravelady.  She gives you back the healing notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Niera gives you the notes and then tells you to return them when you identify the head, so the notes seem to be for the use of ID'ing the head.  Has anyone tried linking/giving the notes to various npc's, perhaps those closest to the Gaedin link?<br />
<br />
2. The rune fragments, have people tried combining them using various tradeskills, Research skill, or linking/giving them to someone near the point of the quest we are at now?  If they are for us they seem to be needed to be combined.<br />
<br />
Maybe since the notes are not for the combine they are for another healer npc that can use themto help with ID'ing the head, either by creating or imbuing a second item to use for the combine with the item that the madman gives us.</div></div><hr />

I decided to read the Ranger walk-through and noticed a few things.<br />
<br />
When the Rangers get the mind crystal they go back and spam the Halfling standing next to Athele and obtain 2 gems.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we need to do the same with the soul item on us.<br />
<br />
The Rangers obtain a &quot;mind crystal&quot; which they give to Corun in Surefall.<br />
<br />
Corun keeps the mind crystal and gives the Ranger a &quot;Red Dogwood Seed&quot; which was brought to him by a &quot;Druid of great skill&quot;<br />
<br />
So perhaps we get the seed on behalf of the rangers and they get the mind crystal for us?<br />
<br />
It looks like the Ranger Epic has them planting the Red Dogwood seed -perhaps we will need to plant a diseased seed next to it?<br />
<br />
The three  Volumes we received involve the Hunters and Teachers going back and forth with information and dialogue. I think we need to work hand in hand with the rangers. The Rangers being the hunters.<br />
<br />
Also The &quot;mind crystal&quot; is obtained from an Enchanter. Perhaps we need a chanter's help also. Help in freeing a tormented warped mind.<br />

Secondly, when I zoned into North ro for the Gaedin script, there were no madmen up what-so-ever, lots of snakes and skeletons but no madmen.  Then I started killing mobs until &quot;a madman&quot; came up on track, went through about 4-5 of those until the indifferent &quot;a madman&quot; spawned.  My guess is even when the 100 minute timer is reached you still have to spawn him by killing random mobs.  All of the tormentors trapped in his head were dark blue to 67 (so guessing they are lvl 65/66).  I brought a guildie ranger for fun (because we were going to CT for his mosquito afterwards).  They all were cake, I was worried about them a little bit but the max hit on me was 300, mostly hit for 100ish or less.<br />

Anyway, my hats off to you folks that can uncover these steps, I don't think I ever would have been able to guess to go into northern ro and hail indifferent green cons, lol.   :thumbup:   And good luck to anyone that is doing the Ulthork Raider, that spawn bites no matter which way you look at it.  :banghead:</div></div><hr />

Can someone try Soulstone + Lost Soul (necro spell) in both Rathe Mts and Feeroot?<br />
<br />
i've not tried this combine, but except from the name of the spell, what indicates this would be a solution?<br />

You eat meat, I bet. Not plants. Nobody eat plants.' The ogre breaks into a frightful laughter. 'Sorry, but I just remember dat guy I bounce little while ago wit da grass in his pants! Funny. Me find him coming out of da mountains so me bounce him into da river. Greenbloods eat him already, prolly, so you no get to.' More grotesque giggling from the monstrosity.

this is not atom science here, but while you (you = anyone) camp this spot. ae the greenies for fun, madmens will spawn, they are on same spawn as various bugs roaming the desert. some say it spawns on a constant time, some say no luck. i say if you sit 2 hours there, have fun. ae the **** out of the place, madmens _will_ spawn. because i know for sure the normal 'a madmen' are on same spawn list as some mobs in the zone, however i have no clue if that applies to the indiff-con one, but hey, its a boring camp.</div></div><hr />

Each person that posts duplicate or incorrect information just makes this thread that much longer. Some simple facts that you should be aware of...<br />
<br />
1. Maiden's Hair is a PLANT! We're not talking about the fallen locks of some damsel in distress.<br />
2. Flerb threw the man in the river where he died, IN FEEROTT! Not RM, not CT...He was thrown into the river in Feerott and we fished him outta the Terror in Feerott.<br />
3. The man had &quot;grass&quot; in his pants, but it DOESN'T make him a scarecrow. I imagine that Niera, mute as she may be, would know A SCARECROW HEAD vs. a HUMANOID HEAD...<br />
4. Geadin IS NOT the man who's head we fished out of the Terror. I think we're past that misconception now, but just thought I should repeat.<br />
5. Unless Sony is completely around the bend, the man's soul can't possibly be in teh Soulstone we get from Geadin, unless of course he ran from SG -&gt; FM -&gt; RM and Feerott with NO SOUL. (granted not a complete impossibility here, but highly implausible).<br />
6. Again unless Sony is just not reading these quests at all, it isn't possible for us to get the Mind Crystal from Corun assuming we are the ones who give him the seed. That would create a paradox such that all of Norrath would be sucked into a huge black hole. (We give seed to Corun who gives us crystal. Corun then gives the seed we just gave him to the ranger that brings him the crystal that he's already given to us.) Now if we aren't the ones who give him the seed then it's still entirely possible. Just pointing out that many people seem to think we can give him the seed and also get the crystal.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be harsh here, but I'm pulling my hair out here re-reading the same mistaken assumptions page after page. It's bad enough to re-read them on each page, but then there's the replies to wade through as well, both the civil and the not-so. Participation is key for us to solve this, but a little reading and comprehension will make it easier for all of us to focus on the key parts instead of getting bogged down with mistaken details.</div></div><hr />

With this in mind I thought I would kill every Greenblood Zombie in Feerrott. But I found one that is stationary at -326, +684 that would not let me cast on it. It would not respond to hails, but maybe it will help identify the man it would suppose to have killed.<br />
<br />
Not sure how yet...<br />
<br />
I have come across the same thing in Feerrott ... a zombie that does not respond to hails, or any links of the stuff that we possess (mangled head, notes or stone) .. can't attack him, get msg saying &quot;You target is too far away&quot; .. and I can't cast anything that will land on him ... it's like he's there .. but not there .. and he cons KoS .... not sure if this is anything but just thought I'd share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Caskin Marsheart says 'Geadin Gyths was, in many ways, a pioneer of soul binding. His research helped to allow the Soulbinders to operate, but he went too far. He was expelled from the Soulbinders for using some of those that came to him for a simple binding as experiment victims, sometimes pulling their souls from their bodies (on accident, he claims) and binding them to a series of gems that he kept on hand.<br />
<br />
a madman says 'Very well. Here it is. Only use it in the area where the owner of that head was killed.<br />
<br />
Maybe... just maybe... the soul stone is one of the gems used to trap souls.  And the reason we need to do the combine where the poisoner dies is so it can do it's work and trap his soul (presumably lingering near where he died).  So while I agree there is currently no soul in the soul stone, I do believe it is a waste of time looking for the James Brown of Norrath.</div></div><hr />

 Druids don't get the crystal for the seed.  The seed flags you to fo 1.5 if you don't have 1.0.  There is no paradox, given this fact...<br />
 <br />
 1.) Druids turn in Seed<br />
 2.) Rangers turn in Crystal, and recieve Seed<br />
 3.) Druids do ??? (turn-in?  key phrase?) and recieve Crystal<br />
 <br />
 It's not a straight swap, just a staggered crossover.  Yay no black holes.  I still strongly believe (as stated a few pages back) that Corun's text from the ranger epic means he'll give the Crystal to a druid.<br />

We have the head of this guy.... and a soulstone, which is used to trap a soul. Assumedly to trap the soul back IN the head so it can talk to us from beyond the grave and whatnot.<br />
This guy died in Feerrott.... if his soul isn't there.... it may well be where he first CAME from. <br />
The first time he was spotted was CS (if he was the one the othmir saw, I know we haven't traced routes quite right yet) so where was he/they coming from? SG, WW, DN, or ToV. ToV is a long shot... I kinda doubt the Claws of Veeshan are interested in spreading decay via plants for Bertox. So let's look around in the far reaches of Velious.<br />

He gave us a stone he used to bind souls to, we now need the soul.<br />
I think we have to look for lost souls/wandering souls etc..<br />
<br />
The help he gave us was to give us a tool to capture the soul of the owner of the head, like he used to do when he was a soulbinder.<br />
And probably the lost soul is still wandering where the guy died. Maybe some rare spawn in Feerrot on nearby.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) Druids turn in Seed<br />
2.) Rangers turn in Crystal, and recieve Seed<br />
3.) Druids do ??? (turn-in? key phrase?) and recieve Crystal<br />
<br />
It's not a straight swap, just a staggered crossover. Yay no black holes. I still strongly believe (as stated a few pages back) that Corun's text from the ranger epic means he'll give the Crystal to a druid.<br />
<br />
Let the search continue!<br />
<br />
The seed that rangers get for the crystal is not the seed of wrath, it's most likely a seed we need to find or create that attacks the disease we're fighting(as listed in Healing Notes).  Since we haven't seen that seed yet, to get the crystal now would indeed be a paradox.<br />
<br />
As for the head, I also think that the guy's soul is in the Feerrott where he died and will be bound by the crystal just by doing the combine where he died.  Problem is either what else needs to be in the head, or if the combine has to be done in a specific place inside the zone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A quick recap of the logic behind getting this far in finding the owner of the head might help.<br />
<br />
After being told by a bouncer that he tossed someone with grass in his pants into the river, we recover a mangled head (and some soggy grass) from the stomach of a monster in Feerrott.  <br />
<br />
We take the head to our main contact in SFG, Niera, who tells us to go find out who it is.  Naturally, we go around showing it to people, asking if they recognize the mangled head (i.e., &quot;Do you recognize this mangled head?&quot;)<br />
<br />
At some point, we get a response from a soulbinder somewhere.   All they tell us is that they don't do that sort of foul magic anymore and that they purged it from their ranks long ago (say &quot;mangled head&quot; to any soulbinder and you'll see what I mean).   <br />
<br />
This leads us to check with other soulbinders, until we run across Soulbinder Grunson, who has a little additional information, and tells us to check with Caskin about his friend, if we want to know more.   A check of the same city turns up Caskin, who tells us about Geadin Gyths, who helped form the soulbinders.   Geadin ripped souls from people and put them in gems.  The soulbinders stopped him, and Geadin went mad. <br />
<br />
This leads us to check for insane people or madmen.   In a zone adjoining the city, one madman responds to his name.  When asked about soul binding, we get a little more information about how he was cursed by the soulbinders.   We help him get free of the spirits driving him insane.<br />
<br />
He conjures a soul stone when asked for it, then gates off.  His final words are:<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you have a skull that you need to converse with. This I know because your soul is open to me. I can conjure something that will help you with this, if you [still desire it].&quot;<br />
<br />
'Very well. Here it is. Only use it in the area where the owner of that head was killed.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW, I assume that Soulbender is a derivation of Soulbinder, not a typo.

Wouldn't the soul be released from the corpse where and when it died unless bound by a geas to remain?  I have been assuming that the plaguebringer (whose mangled head we carry around with us) was on a mission for Bertoloxxus who might place a geas on his followers soul to prevent its release.<br />
<br />
I worry that we might have to wander around Feeroot and Rathe Mountains (or the actual place of death since we have not yet determined where that is) and find a way to channel the soul into the soulstone.  The question is what action we take to find the soul (ground spawn seems unlikley) or raise the dead.<br />
<br />
In terms of location, I would suggest that folks with the Soul Stone (I am not one of them yet) try the temple in the Rathe Mountains that got dropped in there during the Lanys events.  Maybe we have to perform some kind of ritual.<br />

Soul Net<br />

I like this idea.  I will try it the next time I get online (may not be until tomorrow though =/ )</div></div><hr />

Its a very decent item on its own accord, however I really doubt that SoE would force us to start this quest just to use the items for it in our epic.<br />
<br />
I've been following the quest for quite a while now, and I have the head, note, and soul stone myself. I've been trying to figure it out from here just like the rest of you, and I would have posted sooner, but had some registration issues with my email server eating the confirmation letter. Anyways I have hailed almost all the npcs in Feerrott the last couple nights, as well as killing random mobs to see if anything of importance dropped. I even AE'ed the lizard men with my Shiver Spell, to the pleasantness of watching oh .. 30 lizards drop dead instantly. Nothing I can find in the Feerrott that sends us on the next part of the quest.<br />
<br />
Personally I say we forget about the &quot;Coven&quot; until our current search for the head leads us there on our own. Rather than following some random leads, even though the &quot;Soul&quot; hint was correct (as in Soul Binder), I'm sure we'll run into the Coven later, just lets focus on whats at hand.<br />
<br />
BTW: Before you hand your soul stone over to any more mobs people... HAND THE MOB SOMETHING RANDOM.. like a piece of foraged fruit, if the mob returns it, then you can assume its safe that you will get your item back if its not the right npc. If it doesnt hand fruit back to you, might be a good idea not to try your soul stone or you might have to /petition. Just a small hint of advice.<br />

Since he gated off and if they know more of him in that area I would think he may have been practicing this &quot;black art&quot; somewhere down in the tunnels.  The necro guild and rogues are down there.  Perhaps he gated there and will have the other piece in his lab?  So sorry if this was mentioned earlier and I somehow missed the reference reading through the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geranon Morrowind</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think it's slightly obvious that we are no longer looking for Geadin (The mad man) at this point. He gave us what we needed to awaken the soul of the head, and he told us that we needed to use it where the man died (Ie. HE DIED IN THE FEERROTT)<br />
<br />
So currently we are looking for, in my opinion, the second object that we combine inside the mangled head. The quest is what is that object? And the answer to that might be one of the following:<br />
<br />
- It might be a ground spawn.<br />
- It might be another mini-quest item. (Ie. Hand in, or key phase to an npc)<br />
- It might drop off of a random mob.<br />
- It might be a foraged item.<br />
- It might be a store bought item.<br />
- It might be a random item from another quest (doubtful).<br />
<br />
We should not assume that the item will only be found in feerrott, just that the final combine *must* be made in the *area* of where the man died. (which we have concluded to be Feerrott). <br />
<br />
I think Plane of Fear might be a decent place to look for the next clues, or more wandering aimlessly around the feerrott.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank Scirocco  for his list of possible key phrases, hadn't thought of using some of those.<br />
<br />
Great work so far guys, Too bad there are the chumps that have gotten farther than us so far, but they'll be remembered with distain instead of fondness so &lt;shrug&gt;<br />

We killed it and it dropped the mirrored gem.  I looked this up and the only thing that I could find was someone had mentioned an iksar shaman in FoB named Hierophant Liyx who requested ( when spoken to...I had to be in iksar form for him to talk to me, othewise he asked for more faction ) &quot;the stone, two celestial essences, and a mirrored gem.&quot;  I tested him first with a piece of foraged fruit and he gave it back to me so I felt safe in handing in my items.  He ate the celestial essences and the mirrored gem ( because obviously he was looking for those items ) but handed my soul stone back to me.  So, I think that the mirrored gem is definitely out. Just to clarify in case others are curious if this is part of the epic. I don't believe it is.<br />

Found a Soulstone shard that was no drop and Lore. In Nobles Causeway that was a groundspawn in the 1st valley of Murkgliders near DC ZL. Was torwards the end of the valley and looked Blue and kinda roundish and pretty small. Looked like a beak in Inventory. Is on a corpse I plopped out to save it. <br />

Posted at EQdruids on their Epic 1.5 thread, page 47 about halfway down sounds like a very good lead.<br />
<br />
Also post  #849 in this thread contains text from talking to an npc about the unkempt warders who are associated with the unkempt druids in the books from PoK. He mentions fear of speaking of them more and the fact that we shouldnt go near them. These were meantioned as the tribes of the sun and moon in the books. This leads me to believe they have a part to play and are somewhere in JPF. I can not check these out myself as i have just started the quest.  However if someone else wants to investigate these please do, i will be checkin em out as soon as i catch up to the rest of you. Good luck in your hunting.</div></div><hr />

I haven't found any place where anyone has said they tryed to combine the &quot;soul stone&quot; with the Necro EE spell it's self in Ferrott.

We've tried combining the Soul Stone (in Feerrott - at bridge) with bind spell scrolls, rez spell scrolls, EEs, identify spell scrolls and it does not combine. So far theories circulate about capturing his soul somehow, or summoning his soul with the head.</div></div><hr />

This REALLY should have been necro thing I think, but oh well, fun anyway.   :cry: <br />
<br />
It was posted (and hell no I'm not looking for it) that upon combining the head, one of the components will disappear if it is not done in the right place.  I don't think that this would be the Soul Stone, though possible I suppose.  It sounds as though the second piece should be a consumable item that tries to pull the soul of the &quot;unknown spreader of disease&quot; to the head.  Perhaps we are looking for a potion, spell or essence.  More likely, it requires a sub-quest which we haven't found yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, back to the point, they are for the Shakeys Head Quest, which is the Rogue Bypass for epic 1.0.  So unless we have to do the exact same quest they do, we dont need those.  You have to be pretty far into the quest to get the tears from the ghosts.  IF you just go up to them and say &quot;I remember&quot;  You get yellow text saying &quot;You dont know why you are here&quot; or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
So I imagine we can discount those tears, and most likely, that NPC, at least for now.</div></div><hr />

Its right smack dab in the middle of their 1.5.  We should try every item that we can including the tears of the forgotten because the text that the Dark Elf says seems very much on point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zalazar</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the ghosts who kept Geadin at bay were paladins, I went to the paladin guild in North Freeport. Here is what I found ....<br />
  <br />
  (Your Location is 235.87, -178.99, 6.31)<br />
  <br />
  You say, 'Hail, Valeron Dushire'<br />
 Valeron Dushire says 'I am Sir Valeron Dushire, leader of the order of the Knights of Truth. If your soul shines with purity and strength, I urge you to join our order. The might of Mithaniel Marr stands behind all who join. Soon that might will help us free this city from the tyranny of the [Freeport Militia].'<br />
  <br />
  You say, 'who is Geadin?'<br />
  Valeron Dushire says 'According to this crest on the tunic, you have recovered one of the bones of a lost paladin [hero].'<br />
  <br />
  You say, 'what hero?'<br />
 Valeron Dushire says 'His name has been long lost but his legend lives on in every young knight who aspires to continue his fight. He attempted to quell an evil that resided within Kithicor, perverting nature itself. Much to his relief, it was an earthly foe he fought against and not a denizen summoned from the planes of evil. Then, suddenly, he was surrounded by dozens of dark elves. He was captured and taken to the Dead to be experimented upon and had his soul twisted by vile necromantic magics. Then the Teir'Dal cast his remains to the winds. Where they landed, no one knew, until now. You have found one of his bones. I hereby charge you with a holy quest to bring this hero's bones back for a burial with honors. Do you [accept], knight?'<br />
  <br />
  You say, 'I accept'<br />
 Valeron Dushire says 'Good! I knew you would. It is one of the highest honors one can receive. Your quest will not be easy for I know not where his other bones lie. A spy of ours within Neriak was able to surmise that six of his bones, along with his sword and shield, were scattered throughout Norrath. You must search far and wide to find the remaining pieces, as you already have one. Do not give up. It is now your sacred duty. Once you have retrieved all eight pieces, come back to me and inform me that you [have all the bones].'<br />
  <br />
  You say, 'I have all the bones'<br />
 Valeron Dushire says 'Excellent! You are indeed worthy to bear the title of Holy Knight! Now, about the coffin.. I have spoken with Ping Fuzzlecutter, outside the western gates. Ask him about the coffin and once it is made, take it to Simon Aldicott of Marr. I shall have Simon meet you by the lake in the commonlands after Ping gives you the coffin.'<br />
  <br />
  Obviously I dont have all the bones and have no clue if its even relevant to our quest. But I have searched various boards and havent found any other quests relating to this text.<br />
  Maybe it has to do with epic 2.0?!<br />

<br />
Apparently good old Valeron doesn't hear so well. He should give that text as an answer to the question 'Who is Diggs Duggun?' Seems that the oh so good coding makes him give you this quest if you ask him 'Who is &lt;anything&gt;?' *sighs*<br />
<br />
But nope, he is not for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hints that we got from the people who CLAIM to have solved the head portion are:<br />
<br />
A dead NPC will help us, he is a &quot;soul&quot; of some type, and he is found in a place where we wont die. (ie: not in a tough zone)<br />
At first I though the hinter might've referred to &quot;soulbinder&quot;, but Geadin was alive and <br />
<br />
This &quot;soul&quot; does not need a special phrase to get him to talk to us, just hail him.<br />
<br />
doesn't mesh with the &quot;curse dialogue&quot;, so I bet having the soul stone on us to spawn the undead NPC will work just like having the gator charm equipped to spawn the terror. Maybe the stone has to physically be in the head container...?<br />
<br />
Also, the combine inside the head must be zone in the right zone or else you will lose one of the 2 items, and you will have to get the item back.<br />
<br />
This matches what Gaelin said, so I am inclined to believe the hint. Then again it is easier to believe a lie if you sprinkle some truth in it!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I hailed him earlier and used many of the phrases sugested and got no special replys but I am still lacking my Soul Stone.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garowen</div><div class="date">09-29-2004, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion once we get the proper combine item, the combine will work anywhere, but the trick will be having the combined head, when we go to a certain location, like with the Alligator Charm.  once we have a combined head in inventory, just move to the location of the person's death, and bingo, emote text and here spawns his soul, or something.</div></div><hr />

On Torv, I know of 3 times where folks have killed the guy while the folks are killing the ghosts. Yes they are doing it on purpose. An officer of a guild (Wizzy guy) sat there and watched the druid solo'ing the ghosts and then when I ran off the wizzy stood up and nuked the madman. When he was confronted he said nothing about it. So be careful from KS'ers and folks that don't want you to succeed in your quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the undead soulbinder in the Arena may be the key. <br />
<br />
I wonder if something different will happen if you try [bind my soul] with both the soul stone and head container in your possession . The soul stone might interfere with the binding process and bring the soul back to you -- kinda an anti-CoH.<br />
<br />
You talk to the soul who gives you the secondary item.. hot foot it over to feerrott and combine for the ID'd head.</div></div><hr />

 This happened to my group as well, it's a Z-axis bug.  How we worked it:<br />
 <br />
 Our 65th necro could sic his pet on them without the pet getting hurt.   Using an exploit to counter a bug, I guess :lol:<br />

They had said to check SG, WW, DN, ToV. I checked SG track, nothing new. Checked all of DN, nothing new, all of WW, nothing new, Checked places I could walk in ToV and nothing. Was going to take my Rogue with SoS to explore Ntov, but then I looked at the quote from otter in CS<br />
<br />
You say, 'what rumors'<br />
Blumblum Swigwater says 'I hate to repeat such rudeness, but as you insist. Some of my people witnessed a hairless-one swimming from the grotto just before the first sickness was seen. Of course many of your people come swimming out of the grotto, so I would give it little thought. Some of my people have decided that it must have been that hairless swimmer that cause the illness. They say, and forgive me for repeating this, that the skin of your people is poison in the water, that you expose it because it defends you in such ways. Obvious foolishness, I apologize for repeating it.' <br />
<br />
From what it reads the guy came from the grotto, not went to it. So I am in WL now checking there and then SS to see if any new mobs. In WL I found two new mobs, though I think they may be for Bard epic, but upon checking bard epic, they don't seem to be used in it.<br />

Mobs so far in WL: a giant messenger, a giant herald.<br />

Perhaps we need to cast &quot;Bind Affinity&quot; on a soul-something or other while we have the soulstone in our posession to trap the soul in the soulstone. Just need to find the right soul.</div></div><hr />

Seems like just the sort of thing SoE might get you to do as an added timesink.<br />
<br />
There is a quest out of Stonebrunt mountains from the Kejekan village to make a hammer that can free souls from fading shadow and crystallized shadow weapons that drop in ToFS. When you combine the &quot;soulforge hammer&quot; and a crystallized shadow weapon you receive a purified weapon and a soul orb. If you hand the soul orb to Saemey Wirewhiskergrinds with some Kejekan spirit powder he performs a ritual which frees the spirit (a green mob spawns and floats off) as well as receiving a shattered soul orb. Perhaps this NPC and/or one of the items involved in this may be relevant. Relevant quest with NPC text is linked from Allakhazam below.<br />

Perhaps this is the area where the missing person died, and was eaten by alligators (not zombies, as the Bouncer surmised).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, your pet will accept your Soul Stone (/cry) but if that's part of the script, I failed to figure out how to get it to bind (time to redo NRO event) and did not receive it back.<br />
<br />
Edit: at the end of the path leading towards Rathe Mountains, the alligator pet says Food hurt me here once. Leave now. This was at (514, 2786) a few feet before the end of the path.<br />
<br />
At he fork in the river, the alligator says, Much food stop here and wait for me to eat. <br />

<br />
Also, I think we shouldn't give up on Great Bear in Plane of Justice.  He sounds like he might be a Gihjna spirit - that is, Tribe of the Dawn.  Maybe he speaks Elder Elvish or something like Faerie.  I think if we figure out what he did to wind up in Plane of Justice it might move things forward (I am guessing he intefered with human affairs after making an oath not to.)<br />
<br />
There is also another new NPC in Justice: Al'Corisalm   <br />
this was posted in Illia's regarding him:<br />
He responds to you if you talk in Old Erudian.  Talks about how he was the advisor to Erud, and help him build a great city, but he needed the help of 'Geomancers' or 'Druids' to the low man, to construct the great city's transportation/water filtration system that used the power of earth. He was tricked by his best friend into thinking that the geomancer he was using for information was truthful, but in fact the druid he was talking to was tricking him so he would bring down Erud to the level of a common man. After the great disaster that followed from the use of the information that was given to him by the false druid, he was tried by the courts of the 'low man' and his body taked away and his spirit sent to Justice to await try by &quot;The Judges That Have Always Been&quot;.<br />
<br />
The false druid part just caught my eye, might be nothing at all.</div></div><hr />

Geadin was said to store the souls of his victimes in gems. Therefore I feel that we have the soul already (in the soulstone) and should be looking to free it.<br />

And how would Geadin have gotten possession of that soul? He is/was mad, cast out, remember? Why would he know of the person we are trying to ID? It's a nonsense...<br />

Nowhere in the storyline are we told to make the head talk.  The only one that said this was the 'hinter.'  We need to question NCPs about the mangled head and how to identify the remains just as the soulbinder was questioned.  Moreover, I believe the Soul Stone is the end of the Madman trail and that there is another NCP (an examiner, mortician, spiritualist) that will say something to the effect that they cannot identify the remains but that maybe the remains can tell you who they once were...using the soul stone to focus the spirits energy into the head (the madmans egms were used to bind souls in them).</div></div><hr />

So at this point it's a random drop until it's reflagged as a common drop, which my not happen. <br />
 <br />
I suggest helping your fellow druids on your server and they may return the favor when it's your turn. I talk to those camping the spots and tell them my intentions and offer to help if they want it. Bottom line in 2 months from now alot of folks will have there epics and nobody will care how they got it, but they will remember those who helped them get thiers, so share the information and don't try and make it a race to see who got it first.</div></div><hr />

This sounds promising, just need to find the right NPC.  I would add all variations of &quot;Animating Heads&quot; too.  Make a couple hotkeys with different versions and spam em to all NPCs.<br />
<br />
Purely guessing, saying the right key phrase to the right NPC might yield &quot;Animating Heads&quot; (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62828).  ID'd as &quot;The spell inscribed is incomprehensible to you&quot; so probably need to turn it in to sombody to decipher, maybe Gravelady Beddia in PoK or Neira again.<br />
<br />
Disease Rune ID is &quot;Made entirely of ghostly essence.&quot;  Sounds to me like Soul Stone + Disease Rune in Mangled Head = Runed Skull.  Runed Skull to Neira maybe yields &quot;Neira's Research Notes&quot; (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62843)as ID is &quot;Niera's notes about the disease and its effects&quot;<br />
<br />
We're also missing a big raid-worthy battle.  If we're close, it's probably what drops the Disease Rune, and that's what we need to find.<br />

ID'd as &quot;The spell inscribed is incomprehensible to you&quot; so probably need to turn it in to sombody to decipher, maybe Gravelady Beddia in PoK or Neira again.<br />

Theres a female NPC in Abysmal Sea named Cryptosomething.<br />
When hailed she asks if you got something that you need translated.<br />
Sounds to me like she might be the correct turn in NPC.</div></div><hr />

The madman in NRO.<br />
i had finally found the indifferent madman in NRO after 3 days sporadic camping...  i hailed him and went thru the script.  first haunt popped.  no problem.. i notice a noob watching me.  no biggie, even thinking in my head cool maybe he'll just in and start whacking the haunt... haunt died and POP the spirit.. IN jumps the noob.. BUT not on the spirit but on my madman!!  &gt;&lt;<br />
i stop and scream and yell at him, run away, let it be, don't touch. get away.. DON'T!!!!  finally after whacking the madman down to 18% the noob runs away.. well of course the madman is RUNNING after the noob &gt;&lt;   so what do i do?  i SNARE the madman.. BIG NO NO.. after snaring the madman he becomes THREATENING to you.. i finish off the 2nd ghost  and the third pops.. i finish off the 3rd mob.. and NO last ghost &gt;&lt;..<br />
<br />
so i decide to bring the madman to the EC zone... <br />
he follows me there i snare him and then zone.. <br />
zone back in and POP the last ghost is there.. <br />
i kill him , thinking PHEW i may have saved my epic piece.. woo hoo<br />
finish the script up .. <br />
I STILL DESIRE IT!!!<br />
<br />
madman makes the sound and motion of casting ... <br />
AND....<br />
<br />
i get NOTHING :(<br />

currently a petition is in, waiting for results.</div></div><hr />
