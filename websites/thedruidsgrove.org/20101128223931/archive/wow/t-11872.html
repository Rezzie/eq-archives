I continue to maintain my full feral setup, but I keep a full set of healing gear.  I even pull it out in KZ for some raiding occassionally.  You won't be as good as other people, but honestly a decent amount of +healing gear, int and spi go a long way.</div></div><hr />

Now, folks that SUCK at it can make up for it a little bit with spec, but I'll take a GOOD balance or feral spec healer over a BAD resto healer any day.<br />

Definitely put together the best healing set you can and practice your healing whenever you can. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't heal because you're not resto.  Bull honkey.</div></div><hr />

I have healed as a balance druid though at 70 it was similar to pre BC healing, only thing to watch for is Healing touch takes forever to cast and in some of the 70 instances with crap geared tanks you just won't have the time to cast it.</div></div><hr />
