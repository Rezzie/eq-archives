<br />
Right now I am using Vindicators Dragonhide (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30042), Is the other a big enough upgrade to justify the use of 2 nether vortexes?<br />
<br />
Also as far as gems go, looking at 8 agility and 4 agility 6 stamina, this will give 6 more stamina and 3 more agility, at the cost of 1 strength and some intellect. I'll also gain 676 armor in bear.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

However if you aren't, then it might be worth it.  In my view, Agility is king at this gear level.</div></div><hr />

From rawr, it's rated as the best tanking belt in the game - but the resilience is nice to have to be able to reach uncrittable. I personally think it's worth it, especially considering that nether vortexes aren't all that expensive. But I wouldn't go out of your way to upgrade it if you have other things to upgrade, and I wouldn't spend badges on the vortexes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however since i got my Tree-Menders Belt earlier in the week i'll save up my badges to upgrade a heavy clefthoof item or mabye a Ring of Unyielding Force.<br />
<br />
dropped on the 2nd run their so might be worth running this a few times rather than the outlay for the Belt of Natural Power....</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This is one of the biggest drawbacks to the WoW AH system imo. There is a market for this belt but it is rather small. You have to have a seller and buyer meet w/in a 48 hr period. I would love to see a separate system like they have in EQ where you can list items you would like to buy and for what price. Even if someone's buy price is lower than what you would like to sell for, you at least know someone is looking and can touch base with them. I started emailing people who have items I would be interested in buying but who are wanting to sell for more than I would like to pay. More often then not I don't hear back from them but it has resulted in 3 purchases to include a badge of tenacity for less than the &quot;going rate.&quot; I think it also helps if you mention the item is something you are wanting to use vs resell.</div></div><hr />

The Nether Vortexes are the expensive component, the rest of the mats are cheap and/or easy to farm.<br />
<br />
I would make sure you know of someone that can make the belt before you start collecting the mats.  The pattern drops in some high-end raid, so only guilds that run them could possibly have it.  I just asked around on the trade channel for a couple of days.  Eventually someone referred me to another player (a Feral Tank).  He had the pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalbear</div><div class="date">05-14-2008, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked on my realm forum. That worked well. It's not that hard to find either; while it is a T5 drop it's not uncommon to have, and most LWs are fine doing it. I ended up tipping 50g. <br />
<br />
Try offering 300g in trade channel for nether vortexes. <br />
<br />
my personal view (http://wowthinktank.blogspot.com/2008/05/druid-value-of-resilience-for-tanking.html) is that the belt is the worst spot to sacrifice BoNP for resilience. The BoNP is the best tanking belt in the game currently, and it's quite a bit better than the vindicator's belt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was very interested in a pattern for some shoulders last week but had never seen the Hearts for sale.<br />
<br />
given the Heart price i'm glad i did not bid over 500g for a BoP pattern that needs 2 Hearts !<br />
<br />
nethers seem to have stabilised around 300-350g atm.<br />
<br />
and i've never seen a BoNP on our AH and had to ask around players i know in high end guilds to find a crafter.</div></div><hr />

I didn't have the G for it, even *if* i was willing to spend that much on a belt... I think i'll start checking the AH more often though...<br />
<br />
1300G was probably a fair enough price, because he also said that he would craft one with my mats for a 50g &quot;tip&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you can at least grind all the primals and just buy the vortexes you will save yourself a packet.<br />
<br />
this i what i did....2 vortexes for 520g.</div></div><hr />
