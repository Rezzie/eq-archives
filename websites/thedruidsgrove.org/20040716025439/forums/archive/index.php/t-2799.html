[Mon Feb 10 23:49:31 2003] You gained raid experience!<br />
 <br />
  Where did the other waves go?!  I see 1 wave off 1 Blizzard, 2 total off 2 Winter's Storms.  I didn't have logging on when I had a real good bug happen, Winter's Storm hit the mob and 3 people in the raid!  Yeah, you heard that, 3 people who were feared (not charmed) got hit by Winter's Storm on my screen using up the entire Winter's Storm so the mob was only hit once, when I asked the people it said it hit, they said they didn't take any non-melee damage when they scrolled back up.<br />
 <br />
  WTF is going on?!  Seems like a couple nice new bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But two questions, and sorry that they are basic.<br />
<br />
Sure you know that if you duck around a corner subsquent hits of a rain spell get canceled, so if your mob was aoe and you went and hid, only the rains that were falling while you were in LOS will land and the others will poof.<br />
<br />
Second, I would retest this, but I always thought that if you had one rain going, and then cast another, the new one would cancel subsequent hits of the first.  That is, I don't think you can interleave a Winter's STorm and a Blizzard.  <br />
<br />
It has been about a million years since I tried the latter...will give it a shot tonight, but that is what I always thought would happen.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Nope, I was chain casting, didn't have time to move.<br />

 <br />
  I think waves are 3 seconds apart, a second should have landed before I even got the 2nd rain spell of, but it didn't.  Rains have interleaved fine in the past, I just checked my log against Lady N on the weekend and rains were interleaving fine there too.<br />
 <br />
  Someone mentioned that feared people count as NPCs so can be hit by rain.  *shrug* first I heard of that, but it explains that instance anyway.  Doesn't explain why Ulthor was only taking single waves and no other wave was registering on anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My rains are working too well.<br />
<br />
Last night after all these months of no triple crits, I got two triple crits within 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I have not had issues with the waves disappearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NallowinDawnfeather</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the issue of the players getting hit.. this has always been the case.. <br />
<br />
However the players getting hit will not decrease the number of waves since it is ae and all in the area get hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lekrith</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually our rain spells are not true AoE spells<br />
<br />
There are 4 waves that get distributed between mobs in the area<br />
<br />
1 mob will get hit 3 times, and 1 wave is wasted<br />
2 mobs will get hit 2 times each<br />
3 mobs will each get hit once, one wave is either wasted or hits one of the 3..  not sure<br />
<br />
4 mobs will each get hit once.<br />
<br />
keep in mind that the x or y axis position of the mob must not change at all (I.E. rooted)   even melee pushing will cause a rain  to lose its final waves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;keep in mind that the x or y axis position of the mob must not change at all (I.E. rooted) even melee pushing will cause a rain to lose its final waves.[/quote] <br />
<br />
Err...huh?<br />
<br />
Mobs can move slightly and as long as they are within the small range of the AE affect of this spell, the waves will hit.  No, you can't drag them across the hall, but they do not have to be &quot;rooted&quot;.  At least not when I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZairaVhalkerie</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard if you cast on Main Assit it helps also so that what he is on is getting hit by this...has anyone tried this yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocalypse Criterion</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, casting on the MT can have the bonus of simply being easier to target sometimes.  I have casted a wave on 2 mobs before and it hit both mobs 3 times so I dont believe the above info to be correct.  Rain spells do have a small AE coverage so a little movement is allowed but not much.<br />
<br />
Rain's should interweave fine, I often chain rain, while nuking. - no problems there.<br />
<br />
People feared/charmed/with LD symbol are acting as NPC's and hence can be hurt as such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">02-22-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I managed to kill someone's horse with a crit from winter's storm. :)  I'll have to dig up the screenshot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suretass</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As said above, if someone is feared then they are an NPC and will take AoE damage, this will use waves just like any other NPC. Also, looking through there logs they will probably see nothing of this anyway from experience.<br />
I know about this because in Seb once when I was pulling by the Crypt I got a Charmed 62 druid add on me, was actually damn funny but after trying to dispell him and giving him a chance to break charm we just kicked his @#%$ to death.<br />
Of course when we rezzed him he had no idea what had happened and thanked us, I am sure he wouldn't have been so greatful if he had seen who had actually killed him ;-)</div></div><hr />
