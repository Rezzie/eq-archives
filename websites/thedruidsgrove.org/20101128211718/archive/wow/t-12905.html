have you guys noticed an improvement with our range bug?<br />
<br />
i was in Arena last night, my team mate (rogue) died, along with our opposing team's rogue... it was me vs a resto druid... there were a FEW times where i had five combo points stacked, but couldn't land a finishing move, even when i was right on top him...<br />
<br />
the fight lasted about 15 minutes, with me not being able to out-dps my opponents heals... knowing that he couldnt do any real damage do me, (nothing that a a heal from one of my crits couldnt handle) i knew i was never in any danger, but i couldn't down him... he ended up leaving arena and forfeiting the match (for a 17 point rating loss)<br />
<br />
one on one vs a resto druid = :banghead:</div></div><hr />

Seriously, that was the answer.</div></div><hr />

Check out Andridge's replacement skins, they solve the hitbox problem.  Not to mention they're very attractive.  You can link through to them from www.resto4life.com.<br />
<br />
Just make sure to scan your comp immediately after downloading these days; I know literally a dozen people that have been hacked in the last month.   Most of the addon sites seem to get hacked pretty frequently these days by people that insert trojans into the downloads, so anytime I download a mod or a mod update I rescan.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, dps vs. any healing class with good resil numbers 1 v 1 = pain.<br />

Skwid, have you noticed a major difference in our pvp viability on the ptr?  I did a couple bg's on the ptr and it was nice not to be quite so easy an HK anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Berserk is nice, but I took OoC on the PTR so I didn't have it when I tried a few BGs as a kitty.</div></div><hr />
