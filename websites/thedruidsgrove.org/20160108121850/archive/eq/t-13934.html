<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaysa</div><div class="date">05-30-2006, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main is a level 70 Necro, but I recently made a Druid so I could add a little yin to my yang, and... well... port myself : )  My main toon is the only class I've ever played, so I'm not really up on where all the hot Druid spots are.  I've done a few searches, but most of the &quot;level from 1-50 in 3 days, guaranteed!&quot; posts are pretty old and I know that some of the xp bonus zones have changed recently, so I was wondering if anyone could recommend a few current places for me for the earlier levels.  Here's a link to her magelo so you have an idea of where she is gear-wise, and please, feel free to offer up any advice on that as well.  I know she's missing a few slots, but I wanted to try and level her up some before upgrading much more so I wasn't tripping over level requirements so much : ( http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1308012<br />
<br />
Also, I've been collecting a few of the 1.0 epic drops... I know you have to be level 50 to use the clicky, but is there a required level to do the quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still a baby, though somewhat twinked I guess.  Level 13, 1299 hps, 1622 mana.</div></div><hr />

8-14 Crushbone<br />
15-25 Paludal caverns ( To solo, snare yelloweyes and use him as a pet.)<br />
26-30 HHK or dawnshroud peaks (HHK is deserted, but DSP is easy to get a group in usually.)<br />
31-39 Dawnshroudpeaks or Echo caverns ( Both good for practicing root rot while exp'ing)<br />
40-46 Echo caverns big side. (Prolly need a group, unless your hardcore root rotter.)<br />
46-54 Plane of innovation (Will need a group, as some summon and not much room, if you want to solo, kite draniks scar)<br />
55-62 Plane of valor, it will be slow :-(  (Not much for a soloer at these levels, but you could try kiting the phlarg models in PoV while lfg.)<br />
62-65 Bastion of Thunder or WoS. ( Soloing is kind of hard, but PoV should be okay.)<br />
65-70 - ANYWHERE with decent exp. Muramite Proving Ground, Nobles Causeway, or soloing while LFG, any exp to help you get levels. Monster missions were nice for these levels.<br />
 <br />
Also, is the necro on a different account, at 46 take him kiting in nobles causeway and kill alot, levels will be fast.<br />
 <br />
PS: I just made this list off the list of where i leveled my last toon up, i'm sure there are better places to level, but those are okay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can also quad kite human models in the HoH basement, the corner rooms work best.<br />
<br />
My advise - hold at L65 until you get some AA, they are easy to obtain at this level hunting in PoP.</div></div><hr />

I'm still level 13!  Thanks for the tips though, I appreciate it.  Hopefully I'll get there soon!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marpedod</div><div class="date">06-02-2006, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unrest is a great place to PL as a druid (since wolfy is non-KOS) but I'm not sure how well BEING PLed there would work. Iceclad ocean would be good. Throw a dot on a mob, hit it with the druid and FD...rinse and repeat. You get a nice XP bonus there, but I wouldn't head that way until you have your level 14 stinging swarm...the -100 magic resist should make it stick on most mobs. <br />
 <br />
Just make sure you get the FD off before the mob turns, or the necro will stay on the agro table (a well-timed root can solve this, but those mobs will be resisting that for quite a while)<br />
 <br />
Also, avoid the Eastern Waste side of the zone until you are a bit higher.  The cougars near the tower of frozen shadow are easily pulled without all the wanderers that plague the EW side of the zone</div></div><hr />

The druid is on Firiona Vie. Not going to see many people with VP gear at level 13 otherwise.</div></div><hr />
