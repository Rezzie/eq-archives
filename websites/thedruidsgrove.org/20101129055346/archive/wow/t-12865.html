I'm looking at enchants and stuff to put on, I've started to do some PVE now so I've been considering enchanting for Spirit because it's nearly non-existent on PVP gear. My Spirit sits at a depressing 173 but in most Heroics I don't know that I really need it. I'm at a tossup between enchanting Spirit or +Spell Damage like the spell power enchants.<br />
<br />
I've been considering collecting a set of Restore PVP gear to help me when I'm healing. It's a toss up on that though cause I'd have my daughter do it while I'm at work LOL.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think? Yes I am going to do some PVE in my PVP gear cause I don't have time to collect much other gear.</div></div><hr />

No, the stats are not optimal for pve, but that does not mean you can't do your job if you have a reasonable amount of skill.<br />
<br />
Do you mostly heal or do damage in dungeons or raids?  Spirit is good if you mostly heal, if you mostly do damage get spell damage.</div></div><hr />

I will take a regular instance run and heal in it though I have a mostly blue/green set of healing gear for that.<br />
<br />
I remember we used to stack spirit when I was a Resto spec but don't really do it as a Balance spec.</div></div><hr />

You will eventually find pve gear that is better for pve anyway :&gt;<br />
