<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For everyone's consumption - Which focus effect(s) do you currently use and which focus effects do you think are essential for a 61+ druid?<br />
<br />
It may be helpful to readers if you state whether you're a casual or hardcore EQ player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tham Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mana Pres. 4<br />
Imp. Heal 4<br />
Ext. Range 4<br />
Ext. Duration 4<br />
Burning Affliction 4 (if you root/rot)<br />
Imp. Damage 4<br />
Spell Haste 4<br />
<br />
Those are the 7 that I could think of.<br />
Mana Pres and Spell haste are the most useful to me.<br />
Next would be improved healing and improved damage.<br />
After that Ext. Duration, for buffs.<br />
I'd rate Range and Burning Affliction the worst, but that's because I never use a dot other than epic and I'm rarly if ever in a situation where I need to have longer range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Improved Damage IV<br />
Summer's Anger<br />
Spell Haste IV<br />
Improved Healing IV<br />
<br />
Those are the ones I use.  I'd like to get Extended Enhancement IV but as a casual player I can't find an item that is both decent and has that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ER 4<br />
MP 4<br />
IH 4<br />
Summer's Anger<br />
BA4<br />
AE4<br />
8th shawl (extended buffs)<br />
<br />
My guild raids 6 out of 7 days for couple hours each evening.  I do solo and group otherwise.<br />
<br />
Improved Healing, 8th shawl, and Mana preservation for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
Extended Range to avoid nasty AE and keep someone healed or get in the nukes during raids.<br />
<br />
I like to root/dot so I use Burning Affliction and Affliction Efficiency in those situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Effects I currently have/use:<br />
<br />
Improved Healing IV<br />
Zephyr of Brell<br />
Mana Preservation IV<br />
Anger of E`ci<br />
Conservation of Solusek<br />
<br />
What I don't have yet, but will hopefully get soon:<br />
<br />
Improved Dmg IV<br />
Spell Haste 4<br />
Extended Range 4<br />
<br />
In order of importance for me would be IH4, Mana Pres, ID4 and spell haste. Everything after that is a bonus.<br />
<br />
My guild raids prob 4 times per week, sometimes more.<br />
<br />
Tuda, not interested in doing the shawl quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stormfront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Uh, I'm a raider, I'd guess I'm probably a hardcore gamer too.<br />
<br />
Mana Pres4 (hopefully upgraded to Preservation of Xegony soon)<br />
Speeding Thought (18% spell haste to all)<br />
Chill of the Umbra (Cold nuke focus, 26% I believe)<br />
Marr's Gift (IH4 25% instead of 20%)<br />
Summer's Vengeance (25% cheaper mana cost for Summer's Flame)<br />
Enhancement Haste3 (freebee with Emp ring)<br />
Zephyr of Brell (8th Shawl, 20% Buff Duration)<br />
Imp Damage4 (20% to all nukes)<br />
<br />
And I trade out:<br />
Ext Range4 <br />
<br />
In order of importance:<br />
Mana Pres<br />
Spell Haste<br />
Imp Healing<br />
Ext Range (for certain fights)<br />
Imp Damage<br />
Buff Duration<br />
Imp Damage on specific type of nuke<br />
Mana Pres on specific spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I raid lots ...<br />
<br />
Fury of E'ci (30% cold nuke focus)<br />
Fury of Ro (30% Fire nuke focus)<br />
Druzzil's Distance (20% range)<br />
Speed of Solusek (18% detrimental haste)<br />
Quickening of Mithaniel (30% beneficial haste)<br />
Summer's Vengance (25% Summer's Flame mana conservation)<br />
Preservation of Xegony (15% mana preservation)<br />
Improved Healing IV (20% heal focus)<br />
<br />
Of these, I love the Fury of Ro + Speed of Solusek + Summer's Vengance focuses.  I can nuke hard, I can nuke fast and I can nuke pretty much forever.<br />
<br />
Getting summoned and squished on raids is always a problem, but soloing in PoV with a DC pet and KEI ... With these three focuses, I can pretty much clear inner and outer caves before I need to med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have<br />
<br />
Fury of E'ci (30% cold nuke focus)<br />
Druzzil's Distance (20% range)<br />
Contemplative alacrity (15% spell haste)<br />
Summer's Vengance (25% Summer's Flame mana conservation)<br />
Preservation of Xegony (15% mana preservation)<br />
Marr's Gift (26% heal focus)<br />
Focus of Mediocrity (15% longer duration to everything lasting 24 seconds or more)<br />
Pernicious focus (30% mana preservation on detrimental spells lasting more than one tic)<br />
<br />
<br />
The most important I think are improved healing and spell haste on beneficial spells.. These are the ones who will save your butt, the others are just for convenience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am still missing a few of the ones I consider very important but...<br />
<br />
ATM I have:<br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement III (item i got for stats for cheap in ST)<br />
Zephyr of Brell (20% buff extension)<br />
Mana Preservation IV (2 of em, cuz the ornate boots came my way cheap)<br />
Wind of the Nightcrawler (30% beneficial haste...LOVE this focus)<br />
Starfall Symbol (15% range on all spells)<br />
<br />
The things I am most acutely missing that I  think are important for all druids over 61 are:<br />
<br />
Heal 4 type focus<br />
Damage focus (preferably cold and fire)<br />
<br />
The foci I should be getting soonish (in no particular order) are:<br />
<br />
Gift of Marr (my heal focus natch)<br />
Focus of Mediocrity (really want this one)  Hehe - check!<br />
Fury of Ro (or perhaps the VT Flamewarding one)<br />
Fury of Ec'i (or perhaps that VT earing cold dmg focus)<br />
Summer's Vengeance<br />
<br />
The one I really want but don't expect any time soon:<br />
<br />
Burning Afflication 4 (we are done with Torment pretty much)<br />
<br />
/shrug.  Sometimes i think I should just go buy cheap versions to have the effects but I get by fine without em and will just look forward  to having the items I really want rather than earning up some plat to buy stop gaps).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AzariahTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am a 250 potterer, so have made most of the focus items that don't come on armor for myself and switch out as needed (since only fit primary/secondary/range slots).  I am also typically a nuking druid - specialization is evocation and I'm maxed on nuke haste and fury of magic.  I have the following focus effects.  My favorite two are improved damage and mana preservation, followed by spell casting haste.<br />
<br />
Anger of E'ci - may switch out for ID4 in future<br />
Mana Pres. 4 - ornate boots<br />
Imp. Heal 4 - ornate sleeves <br />
Ext. Range 4 - ceramic pottery item, only use on raids<br />
Ext. Duration 4 - shawl <br />
Spell Haste 4 - ceramic pottery item<br />
The mana reduction item on Summer's Flame</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AzariahTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tuda:<br />
<br />
You should at least get a ceramic shield of valor.  At pottery cost if I buy parts in bazaar, its about 5-6k depending upon price of metallic liquid.  Stats aren't uber, but could at least put it on when you do your Po9 buff.  <br />
<br />
They are fairly popular - I sell 1-2 a day on Tunare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Quaras Shadowscythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The focus items that I use are as follows.  FYI -- I am a pre-Elemental druid relatively balanced between nukes and heals (although tipping toward nukes lately with LDON).<br />
<br />
Range:<br />
Anger of Eci (Ceramic Rod of Storms) LDON as fake wizard<br />
Spell Haste IV (Ceramic Totem of Xegony) general use<br />
Extended Range IV (Ceramic Sword of War) raids<br />
Affliction Efficiency IV (Ceramic Gavel of Justice) -- root/dot<br />
<br />
Shoulder:<br />
Zephyr of Brell<br />
<br />
Gloves:<br />
Summer's Anger<br />
<br />
Boots:<br />
Mana Preservation IV (Wanderer's Sylvan Boots)<br />
<br />
Arms:<br />
Improved Healing IV (Wanderer's Sylvan Arms)<br />
<br />
The question becomes whether or not to invest the time and effort into shifting the Extended Range IV and Spell Haste IV items to a new LDON item (mask, ring, etc...) or even to replace my epic with the Ritual Claws of Scion (Imp Damage IV + one type 3 slot).<br />
<br />
In the future, I would love to get a burning aflliction IV item, but that seems unlikely given how buggy the stomach event is.  1/2 of my raid was trapped in the tummy last time while the rest were ported out to fight....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>AzariahTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldn't replace your epic - there is a belt with ID4 that  apparently drops pretty commonly in the same trials as you need for GRC.  2 in one night for my guild.  That way, you don't give up the epic stats.  <br />
<br />
I don't personally see a lot of use for Burning Affliction at the post 60 levels.  I dot so rarely, and killing fast is so important in LDoN.  Haste much better IMO.</div></div><hr />
