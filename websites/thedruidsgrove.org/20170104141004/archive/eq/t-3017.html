BooBoo is about 300hps ish and hits max 30 ish.<br />
<br />
All the &quot;Ahh,,,he's so cute&quot; is about what you will actually get out of him.<br />

<br />
Dunno, not on Bertox, but I paid 2k for it, and got Tunare's Request with it (both spells for 2k).  However I see it for 4k in bazaar regularly.<br />
<br />
Scale from 1 to 10 where does it stand?<br />
<br />
2  ; It owns Wake of Karana and Tunare's Request and pre-fix Allure of the Wild.<br />
<br />
Are you 55+ and have it? Or no? <br />
<br />
56, have it.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't i get it?<br />
<br />
You don't care; you're poor; you hope he gets removed from game and everyone who paid 5k for it gets a copy of Tangling Weeds in their spellbook instead.<br />
<br />
Why would i get it?<br />
<br />
You have money to burn; you need to slaughter level 10 or under things for tradeskills or faction; bragging rights; it dropped for your guild in PoG and they gave it to you.<br />
<br />
Tactics on using Lynx <br />
<br />
(it's a bear not a cat :mad: )  /pet attack, stand back, watch him get eaten.<br />
Seriously though, play a necro or mage to about level 12 or 16 and you'll pretty much understand most pet mechanics.  (SPAM THAT /PET BACK OFF!)<br />
Alternatively go charm solo for a while. :) <br />
<br />
Stats(ie, hp, str, max dam etc unbuffed)<br />
<br />
About 300 hp, max hit double 28 + bash  (the bash is the only redeeming quality really; makes him worth having out for an easy exp camp to interrupt casters)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/covers jababer's ears<br />
Ok:<br />
<br />
I'm on bertox.  It usually sells for around 2k.  I got mine for 500.  I would feel ripped off if I had paid more then 1k for it, though back when I really wanted it I would have paid 3k.  Now that I have it, well he's cute and he's very druidy, and he's good for farming lvl 15 mobs.  That's about it.   Gets killed by 2 ripostes, or an aoe, basically. Ridiculous mana cost also, which makes it undesirable to buff him (unless you want to be oom with your lvl 25 pet all nice and shiny and useless)<br />
<br />
Have seen a few in the baz for around 2k.  I currently have seen a crackhead in the bazzar trying to sell for 9k.   What a maroon, but he thinks its worth that much.  <br />
<br />
Try and get it for 1k, its really not worth more then that I think.  Try Phantom Raiders, Prophecy, Healers of Norrath, Dragon Council.   Ask a member ***nicely*** if someone responsible for their guild vault is on, or if they have one.   You might get lucky and be able to buy a copy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, in reference to Wake of Karana and Tunares Request above.<br />
<br />
Wake now stops the snow. Value just skyrocketed as far as usability depending on your hunting grounds. I used it twice this weekend already.<br />
<br />
If you do tradeskills, mainly tailoring, a fully buffed griffawn in EK vs Crag Spiders is a blast and very helpful. SoWed he runs right along with me and kills everything.<br />
<br />
I still cant decide on DCs value, I use Call of Karana so often that I am not sure a nonbreaking lower level is a bonus, the current hunting grounds DC wouldnt work.</div></div><hr />

Because you stop the chance of it snowing again for a certian period of time.  I belive a half hour or so it will not start raining/snowing, thus guarenteeing you time for your raid to do it's thing with decent visibility.</div></div><hr />

It still doesn't start the rain either.</div></div><hr />

On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give it a 1.<br />
<br />
I'm 60, have it... Until recently, never cast it.<br />
<br />
My Booboo has lived through our last 3 Sontalak kills and the last 2 CT kills. No idea on his dps but I buffed him up... Initially when the raid leader said &quot;all pet classes MUST have pet up&quot; for Sont, I didn't consider Booboo inclusive. He was. And not a charmed Rhino because charm can and will fall. They wanted Booboo up. I laughed and said he'd be dead within 3 secs. I was wrong. :)</div></div><hr />

With the best pet buff we get, he is like an added DoT.  I use him when 2-boxing with my monk.  Attack with the monk, get aggro, send in BooBoo with /taunt off.  He adds a few hundred manafree damage while I can med :) <br />
<br />
Only problem is when I accidentally feign on the monk.  BooBoo takes about 1 hit and poofs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SexyPortal</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the little guy.<br />
<br />
I've used him quite a lot for all sorts of reasons.  To freak out newbies, to farm silks, or bonechips, etc.  For faction quests, or just to hunt for some lower level items.  He can also be handy for pet kiting.  I gain aggro with Dots and go for a run around, letting the pet hit the mob from behind.  <br />
<br />
I think he even saved my @#%$ once, when I got a train somewhere and he stepped in.  The few seconds he kept stuff busy was enough for me to escape.<br />
<br />
He's a funny little guy, and amusing to have around.  Sow him and he's funny as hell to chase after something.<br />
<br />
He's quite useful if you fully buff and haste him.  He'll drop spiders in EQ non-stop, and give most other things a good go. <br />
<br />
I'd buy the spell if you find it cheap, play with him.</div></div><hr />

I think i paid 4k for it, it doesnt get sold very often, and i usually see it auctioned for 6-10k  for some bizarre reason. <br />
Dont bother with the pet spell unless you have the cash to burn, the only use ive really found for it at all (and not even that practical really) is to have him as a little mana battery just sitting around waiting to be reclaimed</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not very good for soloing or against aoe mobs but in groups or on raids he kicks a little behind. You just have to remember to turn taunt off the second you cast him it's 600 mana wasted. My pet has survived Hate and kept Vindi occupied for the half a second more needed for the cleric to camp hehe. He's also good if you have an agro kite group in UP farming armor, 6 little bears chasing an elysian that is having free snare chain casted on him kills them pretty fast when stacked with 6 WD's and 6 free drones. Also done UP with booboo, mage pet, cleric pet and wizzy pet, also very mana efficient for elysians. He also ads DPS killing other things as long as taunt is off. Remember /taunt off.<br />
<br />
At the very least on raids he is comic relief and a chick magnet. Booboo's real power is sniffing out any ACTUAL females that play the game :p <br />
<br />

  Does green con pet taunt do anything to a blue con mob?  I end up shutting it off so I dont' get spammed, but I've never actually seen him successfully taunt anything before.  If it's the same as warriors he won't be able to taunt anything over his level, like 30 or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vowelumos</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted something not to long ago.  On level 45ish mobs boo boo did decent damage.  i will have to dig up the numbers, they are on ehre somewhere.  He was a very  (It was over 4 to 1 ratio, including the cost of keeping the pet buff on him) mana efficient damage spell (if you can keep agro off him for 10-15 minutes in a good fast pulling xp group.)  Obviously AE or cases where there will bot be PCs on top of the mob, you will not get good results.  <br />
<br />
He will always take aggro from any pet cast by a person the same level as you (I have tried with Shamans, Necros and Magicians).  I believe this is because he is a very low level and our pet haste gets him noticed.<br />
<br />
He bashes a lot, and can be quite succesful on higher level mobs, making him a usefull addition when fighting non-ae casters.  I will try him next time we our hanging out in Kael and parse the results (since those tend to be 50-57 mobs).  There are not really enough HP in any HP buffs to make it worth putting on him (He always takes full damage from every mob swing cause he is so low).<br />
<br />
  Pet buff only and try to keep him from getting hit.  I am not sure if the feature (bug) allowing us to get him to dual wield and use weapons (like gnoll hide lariat, etc) is still working(broken), but that just increases his useullness, while somewhat increasing the cost.<br />
<br />
As a little aside he also helps you get a chance to move over by the enchanters AE stun when your getting beat on.  Although he will die.  Aggro=Death for boo boo (Except in the warrens, where he is a faction machine).</div></div><hr />
