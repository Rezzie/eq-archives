<br />
It's a MR check snare which lasts 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
I am looking for feedback on this as a AA line.  Do you like it? Hate it? Want to see more of it? Want to see it different? Tell us how you feel ;p<br />

It doesn't really replace serpent vines, but I get another spell slot while dot kiting for another dot or a nuke.  And I can sneak it in during the recycle rather than having to wait for the recycle, cast ensnare, then wait for another recycle before continuing to dps.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about continuing that line though.  The only real continuation would be to make an AA that replaces Serpent Vines with an equally low resist snare.  I'd certainly be in favor of that, but that might be more of a fight with SOE than it's worth.  Or maybe an AA of Entrapping roots.  /shrug.  I still want a defensive proc low resist knockback root and a longer range on spore spiral /nod.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I am tempted to take down Serpents for a night and see how it goes.....I cast it if resisted....root mob recast.....about 30% resist ratio so far but in exp grp is nice and wizard friend asks me to single snare alot anyways well pop this and go!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dislike that it gets resisted too much. I haven't played with it too much yet, but I bounced it 3 times in a row on gray con mobs in Seb, which sorta pissed me off. <br />
<br />
If it will overwrite Serpent Vines, thus allowing me to use Serpent, then Entrap for the longer snare, I will be moderately happy with it. Otherwise, it's just another button that forced me to rearrange my hotkey banks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we are to get an AA version of Serpent Vines, it should be a separate AA (so that we can use both AA snares, instead of &quot;upgrading&quot; one to the other).  There are times when Ensnare/Entrap is preferred over Serpent Vines, even though Serpent Vines is better in the majority of situations.<br />
<br />
The one thing that I think needs to change in the meantime is that it should be flagged as a DRU/RNG spell.  That way focus effects can apply to it, in the same way that focus effects apply to Ensnare.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
played with itn fc the other nite and lands every cast <br />
 <br />
my self i liek it its what i call my opps dam i shoudl of had snare loded but dint aa i use to use the clikcy shiled for thsi but now that i got ths aa i can always be rdy is no time flat for a snare.<br />
 <br />
i dont think its relayable to call it a replacement snare for are cast line of snares but its a good aa to have for that tiem your out mucking around and unloaded snare for like a paccy line or annaule line for its place</div></div><hr />

I used it on the Icefall mammoths and didn't notice any difference in fail rate over ensnare.</div></div><hr />

     Its really great in groups or on raids to use in groups or on raids to cast between spells.  Debuff, hit the aa button and then ready to cast something useful.  Or on those occasions that serpent vines is resisted, at least once the aa then stuck.<br />
     Also, I still keep serpent vines memmed, but use the aa to extend the snare when im kiting and get more than one mob while soloing.<br />
     <br />
     As far as an upgrade ...... I suppose a resist modifier would be the natural idea, but if it involved shortening the length of the snare down to SV level, lets just leave well enough alone.<br />

But it is nice to have an aa snare to overwrite Serpent's for times I need a longer lasting snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">09-10-2007, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heck, I'll post it over here too !<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
In scenarios where I need to have a snare memmed, more often than not I need the snare for pulling/splitting, and in those instances, its Serpent Vines all the way for the chromo resist check. In a group, mobs die fast enough even if they do run its only a few steps and splat dead anyway. The days of needing to snare for a group are fast fading. Snaring to prevent low life run when soloing, now thats a different matter.<br />
<br />
I will likely continue to mem Serpent Vines for soloing, although Entrap has enabled me to delete the bandolier for Tanglewood Shield (much h8 to mem ensnare).</div></div><hr />

I would still use Serpent Vines all the time and basically forget I even have the AA.  If it had a resist check adjustment (of any kind), I'd find it more usefull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible that they gave this to us to prepare for upper ranks of the AA in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
I noticed this on lucy just now:<br />

<br />
The movement decrease is 65% whereas regular entrap is 56%, as is ensnare.  <br />
<br />
Its all just speculation of course.  However, even a slight increase like this would be very helpful.  There are plenty of mobs that are still booking after you after they are ensnared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanoliene</div><div class="date">09-13-2007, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's great for using after serpent vines to get that long snare and we've been using it on raids where mobs needs long term snare. <br />
 <br />
In general I don't snare enough to love it. I'd rather nuke them one more time since most of the mobs I kill while grouping don't last that long anyway. It gets resisted far too much on the mobs that I kill to use as my primary snare if I had to though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">09-17-2007, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked it on my ranger. Was extremely useful. Although, most druids would not use it for snap aggro like I did on my ranger occassionally.  It is quite useful like say a shadow knight and/or necro has been using darkness, and it went the full duration, and the mob starts to run. Also, for  multiple snare resists, entrap at last second, mob dispelled snare at last minute it was quite useful in case of a quick getaway or near to a quick get away from a mob. Useful in almost every situtation. <br />
<br />
I know when kiting Agnarr(and similar events) I would have liked it alot to get some space between snare resists without getting smacked around getting him snared on my druid. Should be a good addition to the druid class.</div></div><hr />

Don't sweat it, the druid community is probably happy with that decision too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice to have (about time, damn SoE gave to Rangers and not us:).<br />
Almost free snare. (a few AAs are nothing)<br />
Resisted too often.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
Since it was free, I can't complain too much.  Only drawback is resist rate.  Still hoping for an upgrade someday so I can use my snare spell gem for something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiritis</div><div class="date">09-23-2007, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like it, I use it all the time while soloing.  There are a bunch of mobs I kill that outlast serpent vines.  I had been needing to remember to recast serpent vines or keep ensnare memmed and using both.  Now I cast serpent vines and click the hotkey while my gems are refreshing.  Works great.  It is resisted a lot, but since it's basically an AA version of ensnare, I was expecting that.  <br />
<br />
If there were AA's that would help it be resisted less often, I'd buy them in a heartbeat.  However, the strength of the aa is in the duration so I wouldn't want to sacrifice that.</div></div><hr />

Makes pulling groups of mobs much easier, hit snare gem, slap the Entrap hotkey, by the time it's done casting your spell gem should be refreshed. Also usefull on high resist mobs i.e CoA for a spamfest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xarra</div><div class="date">10-07-2007, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely love it.  Stuck it on my hotbar as 1 so i can use it durring recast delay.  I love the short reuse timer, who cares if theres resists ive used this in raid content and had it land on mobs on first cast so atleast its more useful then our stun nuke.  It seems that the way it works is that each time ya cast it it will work down their resist check a little, if thats not how its working its how it should be working imo, just stick a second spell on it that will decrease the resist only to the snare by 10% with each cast or sumthing.  On resistant mobs it seems that max it takes me 4 casts of it to get it to land.  I've yet to see 5 resists in a row which i have seen useing our nonchromatic snares.  Used when kiting or root rotting, it lets you use snare as many times as needed alternating either a dot or root untill it lands.  Long enough duration to make me happy even if it isnt effected by item foci.  And if your tanking or need agro for some reason it adds a little durring recast delay.<br />
<br />
Yes it could be better but then it would overpower all casted snares rendering them useless.  I didnt think that was the intent of them giving us the AA but if it is then yes they need to fix the inital resist check, if not i think some form of one that works the mob down based on number of casts would be fair enough to request.</div></div><hr />
