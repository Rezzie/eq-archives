My girlfriend and I enjoyed it but I hear that hardcore Star Wars fans didnt care much for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only point where I blinked and thought, now that didn't make sense was the scene where Palpatine had his face changed.  It just seemed like a half-baked explanation for it. :P</div></div><hr />

The pacing was awful, the dialogue stilted, and the characters were flat and emotionless. <br />
<br />
While no one could ever call Ep. 4-6 &quot;High Cinema&quot; in a conventional sense, they are when compared to the overbloated prequels. What Lucas has forgetten is that special effects in no way can compensate for weak storytelling and, sadly, the gensis of Luke, Leia, and Han is just that. <br />
<br />
I had high hopes for Sith; that somehow it would be strong enough to wash away the bad taste of Ep. 1-2. Now I'm just doing everything in my power to forget those films exist except as examples of what happens when a director becomes a bit too full of himself. Perhaps he was too close to the project and needed to step back and let someone else take the reigns. In any case, Lucas has not done a service to his original films, which could have easily stood alone.</div></div><hr />

If anyone is interested here is a Slightly edited Episode III script (http://ter.air0day.com/?script=revengeofthesith)  Not entirely safe for work but funny as hell.</div></div><hr />
