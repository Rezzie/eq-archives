The druid is fire flagged, the beast isn't. <br />

The druid has DoD, the beast doesn't.</div></div><hr />

(Doable with 2 groups pretty easily nowadays). Besides that; maybe Nobles Causeway, SolRo Temple...etc.</div></div><hr />

I can duo diving for lavarocks DoN in about 50 minutes as well, all the pulls are single with no adds (just need to kill 15 and find 6 rocks) plus you get 35 radiants each :)</div></div><hr />

tell me more stumps.<br />

I was actually gonna ask a similar question at some point, in fact I saw the title of the post and wondered if I'd posted it drunk already.<br />
 <br />
have a time + geared bl and want to get him xp.  druid is maxed aas and will heal from outta group.  both are fire flagged (did exactly as netura was suggesting to get the bl flagged last year). sol ro's ok for xp, but not much fun with all the add mgt you have to do trying to keep aggro on one toon.<br />
 <br />
what's the name of said mission and do you need 3 peeps to get it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stumps_Bertox</div><div class="date">12-06-2005, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, diving for lava rocks, from the dwarf on keepers faction. <br />
 Park BL at zone , have egress memmed, there are some see invis, just follow the lava and look for purple blobs sticking out of the lava, wack it once or so and get your rock. Be warned, some of the rocks have drakes in them, but they dont hit hard, and you can egress.<br />
  I can usually burn through the 15 drakes in 30 minutes (for lesson), takes 45min to 75 minutes in total, usually about an hour to do.<br />
Ive noticed the lava rocks spawn in the same areas most of the time, so this is an easy, relatively safe way to get some crystals and exp. <br />
 You need 3 to get it, and having a dps in group really speeds the drake killing up at least, but its very doable with 2 people.<br />
With a BL tanking hand of ro and suns corona are your friend..i cast both on every mob, every time (unless its light blue or green hehe).<br />
Fire lands great on the drakes in lavaspinners, go figure :)</div></div><hr />
