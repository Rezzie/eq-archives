Not that i'm against giving ferals tips but I just wanted to start a thread for my moonkin brothers and sisters to learn and spread the knowledge.<br />
<br />
I'll just put a few general strategies that i use to start the ball rolling:<br />
<br />
vs any caster: Stay in caster form because you will most likely need to heal. Keep rejuv and 3 lifeblooms up if possible. Keep in mind that the warlocks' felhunter and mages can steal you HoT's and shamans can purge them. Put moonfire and insect swarm on them and then cast wrath if they stop moving otherwise try to LoS them and refresh moonfire/IS when it is out. Treants work ok vs most clothies because of their damage but any good player will know how to get rid of them :(<br />
<br />
vs any melee: Stay in moonkin if you are in danger of being hit, use instants to cause damage. Once you get in melee range control the player using NG, roots and cyclone. If you get a cyclone off, ALWAYS use that oppurtunity to get a heal off. Then switch to moonkin again for the pew pew. don't forget to Fairy fire rogues and druids. Also treants pwn rogues almost every time for me. <br />
<br />
in a group: keep your distance and nuke using wrath or starfire if you feel reasonably safe. Heal your teammates, escpecially if they are doing some damage because they keep the flack from coming your way. If you get some agro then switch to travel form and run. Stealth your way back and continue from the first step. <br />
<br />
These are fairly general but I usually start with this kind of strategy and then play it by ear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one of the most under rated trinkets for the same thing<br />

works great for keeping rogue types from disappearing and sticking a blade in the back, and great from interupting casters spells</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just this past week I swear I've seen that trinket being used more and more. Maybe it's just coincidence but it seems like people are cluing in to the real value of that trinket.<br />
<br />
Mine will always be for cleaning my house.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weaselking1973</div><div class="date">08-03-2007, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh i use it just in BG/PvP<br />
<br />
but its honestly only any good for rogues that like to fade, and mages.<br />
<br />
locks just toss a fear and they all run around untill they despawn.  its more of a fast click outta trouble type thing cause the cool down takes to long for it to be truely effective in BG.<br />
<br />
I have yet to do arena so couldn't say on that, but in world PvP and horde hunting its great... pounce. attack attack maim attack then click... on casters they wont survvie if you get at least 1/2 your attacks as crist and with the poped guys from the trinket keeps them from casting before you get the kill ****.<br />
<br />
one day i will try it in the arena just cause... well if i ever get to the arena</div></div><hr />

<br />
I faced a hunter a few times and found great success with hibernating their pet and then moonfiring them until they drop.  Just constant moonfire.  I would throw an insect swarm on as well and I'm sure the DoT from moonfire was still ticking while hitting them with moonfire but that took them down nicely.<br />
<br />
I faced a warrior and after several attempts I took him down with root and treants, plus starfire and wrath.  He was very tough though because he could charge and stun, plus he hit hard.</div></div><hr />

IOW, you position yourself such that the opposing player (or mob) is unable to obtain LoS to you so they can cast.<br />
<br />
In PvE LoS'ing is often used to &quot;pull&quot; casting mobs (or bowmen) away from their starting position.</div></div><hr />
