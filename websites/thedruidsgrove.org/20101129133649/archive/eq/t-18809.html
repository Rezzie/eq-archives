ISTANBUL (Reuters) - What happens when you put a Muslim imam, a Christian priest, a rabbi and a Buddhist monk in a room with 10 atheists?<br />
<br />
Turkish television station Kanal T hopes the answer is a ratings success as it prepares to launch a gameshow where spiritual guides from the four faiths will seek to convert a group of non-believers.<br />
<br />
The prize for converts will be a pilgrimage to a holy site of their chosen religion -- Mecca for Muslims, the Vatican for Christians, Jerusalem for Jews and Tibet for Buddhists.<br />

Wave their magic holy wands and see if a red &quot;A&quot; appears on my forehead?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">07-04-2009, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or it could just be government propaganda, where viewers get to watch all these &quot;atheists&quot; suddenly profess their love for Islam, the best religion (of course).<br />
<br />
In any case, what's the prize for not converting?  A free trip to Norway or Japan?</div></div><hr />

I would be curious to see if some atheists are converted from the panel itself, and not the contestents. Either way, I don't see things going all that well.  I see it going like that talk show host Jenny, i think it was, that invited a guy to her show to reveal his crush, then it turned out to be a guy with the crush, who then, a couple weeks later was murdered so.....</div></div><hr />
