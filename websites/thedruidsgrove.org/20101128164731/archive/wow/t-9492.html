<br />
Turak will send you to speak with Dendrite Starblaze in Nighthaven, Moonglade.  This is the same quest giver for all the Druid Quests.  <br />
<br />
Dendrite will give you the Quest &quot;The Principle Source&quot;  he will give you an Empty Dreadmist Peak Sampler and ask that you fill it from the pool on top of Dreadmist Peak in the Barrens.  Dreadmist Peak is NorthWest of the Crossroads on top of a mountain.  The peak is guarded by members of the Burning Blade.  You will need to fight your way to the pool.  Once you have filled your Sampler at the pool take it to Tonga Runetotem at the Crossroads.<br />
<br />
Tonga wants to cure the gazelles but he needs more than just the water he will ask that you collect 5 Earthroot and 5 Kodo Horns.  The Earthroot can be gathered off rocks in the Barrens if you are a Herbalist or gotten from other player Herbalists.  The Kodo Horns drop from Lost Barrens Kodo's that wander the Northern part of The Barrens.  Once you have 5 of each return them to Tonga.<br />
<br />
Tonga will mix up a batch of Curative Animal Salve from the items you have gathered for him.  He then asks that you use the Salve to cure 10 of the Sickly Gazelles that wander the northen end of The Barrens.  You will need to get fairly close to the gazelles and use the salve while targeting them.  Once you have cured 10 return to Moonglade and speak with Dendrite Starblaze again.<br />
<br />
Dendrite will reward you with A Velidust Medicine Bag (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=15866) and advise you to speak again with Turak Runetotem in Thunder Bluff. <br />
<br />
Return to the Druid Trainers in Thunder Bluff and speak with Turak.  He will teach you the spell Cure Poison.</div></div><hr />

Also, regardless of whether you're Alliance or Horde, LEFTCLICK the gazelles/deer. If you rightclick and go in to apply the salve, you'll melee and kill them... which will delay you getting Cure Poison.</div></div><hr />
