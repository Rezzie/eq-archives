<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cassea</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me preface this by saying that I know things on test do not always go live and can change on an hour by hour basis.<br />
<br />
I would ask my fellow Druids to respond to this with an &quot;at-a-boy&quot; or thanks for the continuing effort to address Druid concerns.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank Verant for the &quot;effort&quot; they have put in thus far in an attempt to balance all classes and make the game fun for all.<br />
<br />
In regard to Druids the following has been done on test or already live:<br />
<br />
1. 10% healing penalty removed. (live)<br />
2. Snare removed from epic. (test)<br />
3. DOT's made to stack (test)<br />
4. NPC's had effect slots upped from 15 to 30 (test)<br />
5. Percentage Heal added (test)<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that some of these changes required some serious code changes/additions and were not just a few numbers in a database. These are the most positive changes &quot;ever&quot; for the Druid Class and it clearly shows that while the &quot;new&quot; Verant does not like to converse as much as the &quot;old&quot; they let their actions speak for them.<br />
<br />
Verant is going to take alot of heat from some narrow minded people about any &quot;real&quot; changes to the Druid Class and we need to express our thanks and encourage Verant to do what is right and not just popular.<br />
<br />
For sure we can list our personal &quot;tweeks&quot; to this proposal or that but I am now confident that Verant is doing some real testing and will come out with some significant changes that will alter the face of the game like Melee Balancing did for the Melee Classes.<br />
<br />
A hardy THANK YOU VERANT and THREE CHEERS....<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

It all snowballed into more and more negativity which in turn led to more druid distain by some other classes...<br />
<br />
By your own admission and many others, healing was the most complicated to resolve and wouldnt have been fixed even in a month or 2. So here we are only 5-6 months later and we are seeing dramatic changes... changes that hardly anyone saw coming (assuming it goes live).<br />
<br />
I think the real lesson here is that as you point out in bold.. &quot;Rome wasnt built in a day&quot; and many druids need to realize that neither was EQ... many have had valid points over the last 5 months but nobody seemed willing to step back and give Verant the benefit of the doubt and show a bit of patience... a truely deep lesson for many around here if they are willing to step back and take an honest look in the mirror and reflect on thier actions of the last few months.  Granted, Verant added fuel to the fire with a lack of updates, but they did say they were working on it.. they just didnt provide details that many druids wanted.<br />
<br />
In the end, kudos to Verant for listening and kudos to many druids around here for presenting many creative ideas to resolve shortcomings... both contributed equally to what appears to be a an approaching happy ending, either through test changes or similar ones yet to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Whatever the outcome and whatever the delay the simple fact is that Verant is pushing hard now to return the fun to the game for many people.<br />
<br />
Verant needs to be encouraged and if anything we need to help Verant weather the oncoming storm that oft occurs when major change takes place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cornering a Lion.. has always been bad .. for your health.<br />

Lets just say, we spoke as a class, as a forum and they listened, many concerns from many different sources, even the Clerics.. and this team Understands and Plays the Game, they are open to new concepts and ideas. <br />
<br />
They are not mindless robots like I have seen in the past.<br />
<br />
I would just say thank you.. and leave it at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, a lot of the heart ache, animosity and bile on the message boards and in game towards and amongst druids could have been avoided or at least reduced if someone from VI had simply given some idea of what they were working on to the general public.  They remind me of that relative who comes over on christmas eve with a wrapped present, gives it to you saying &quot;look at that!  you're gonna like that!  but you cant have it yet!  oh you can guess whats in it, I gave your brothers and sisters some too, but they're not all the same!  But you've gotta wait until I wake up on christmas morning, and I dono when that will be!&quot;  Flip side their botched focus item announcement and implementation... /shrug.  Hard to win I suppose.<br />
<br />
So anyway, should be interesting enough to keep the raiding druid at least semi viable.  I'll give a cheer at least if they go live with the changes.  :cool: <br />

I don't play a druid in EQ. Only got one to lvl 2 before I went back to my cleric (lvl 60/epic) and necro (lvl 55).<br />
<br />
Reading through this topic just made me realize how egoistic some druids can be...you totally ignore the impact of your whining and requests on other classes.<br />
<br />
You see something you're not as good as another class is and then immediately start to whine about it completely disregarding what other skills your class already has. I always hear druids whine that they can't buff as well as clerics do (HP buffs) - when will you whine for a druid version of Aegolism? I heard so many druids whine about the bonus clerics got to healing spells. Clerics are the PRIME HEALERS by Verant's definition, your pathetic whining resulted in the clerics losing one of their most class defining abilities, being able to heal more efficiently than any other healing class - sure, we still have CH but from there to go CH a caster...ok, we have our Heal over Time spells...well shammies get Torpor, too...<br />
<br />
Next thing you'll beg for are rezzes so you don't have to try and order clerics to come rez you...<br />
<br />
If you need more skills or skills adjusted then you most definately can't play your character because the druids are very powerfull and very well-balanced if only you take the time to play the class well. I have met some damn good druids - they were so good because they didn't spend all their energy in whining.<br />
<br />
No wonder so many people call druids whiners...I might also start after reading through what you requested.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suggest that the continued expression of disgruntledness by the Druid players on this board played a large role in getting many of these changes.<br />
<br />
Had we sat quietly waiting for changes to come...we'd still be waiting.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake about that.<br />
<br />
As for druid distain by some other classes.  To be blunt, @#%$ them.  They've distained the Druid class for years already.  The players who have a clue, realized that Druids were broken and our complaints well founded.<br />
<br />
Don't you think its about time you started thanking all those bitter druids out there who spent the time researching and arguing for the changes you have/are about to benefit from?  Instead of continuing to berate them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Highsoul</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only bitter druids I know of are the whiners, the happy druids are those who enjoy the class and those who can play the class through offsetting weaknessed with skill (this doesn't just apply for druids, every class is great if the player focusses on getting more skilled rather than to whine for improvements).<br />
<br />
Oh sorry, you druids are so weak...I mean you only get...<br />
<br />
...track<br />
...snare<br />
...SoW<br />
...heals<br />
...buffs/debuffs<br />
...ports<br />
...evac/zone evac<br />
...nukes<br />
...DoTs<br />
...animal specific spells/skills (non-Kos to most animals; animal charm/DC, animal fear etc)<br />
<br />
You're right, your class is definately lacking...<br />
<br />
...nukes like wizards<br />
...heals like clerics<br />
...melee buffs like shammies/chanters<br />
...melee skills like monks<br />
...DoT capabilities of the necro<br />
...debuffs like chanters and shamans<br />
...rezzes<br />
<br />
Whine for these things and you'll be able to raid with just druids.<br />
<br />
Or stop whining and start learning to use the existing druid skills effectively. Or do you think quadding, training others, stealing named mobs or constant whining is using your class' skills?<br />

Very true.  The voices of other druids who disagreed were &quot;moderated&quot;.</div></div><hr />

However, I do have a concern for maintaing class specific balance.<br />
<br />
If the 75% druid cheal goes through it will significantly be detramental to the cleric class.<br />
<br />
How?<br />
<br />
Why have a cleric in the group when you can get a druid who can c-heal, sow, and evac (to name a few).<br />

<br />
I may well be the biggest critic of a lot of the whining that goes on here, but at least I try to be honest.  You just made that up, or got it from 1 freak post over on EQ Druids.  The only thing Druids have asked for regarding HP Buffs/Aego is that Aego stop Overwriting PoTG.  They want the spells to not stop on each other, that is all.</div></div><hr />

I guess all the negativity about &quot;druids are broken&quot; and &quot;druids are useless&quot; made me defensive.<br />
<br />
None the less there have been some great changes and while I may not believe them to be  essential to my class, I am certainly happy about anything that helps me fill my role better and be even more of asset.<br />
<br />
So I just want to throw my thanks in as well - especially if you remove the snare off my epic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broomhilda</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll say thanks for at least listening, since we're not sure yet if we're even receiving anything as of right now.  I think what you came up(Druid CH) with is a better fix to our class, and the high end game overall than any idea that i read.  My guild is constantly short Clerics(short mages, rogues, wizzies, basically all the classes the uber guilds recruit), in fact we had a few leave to join Uber guilds when they were recruiting that class.  There were a number of times where we couldnt raid what we wanted to due to lack of Clerics.<br />
<br />
One thing we do have are Druids, hopefully the changes will go live and we'll be able to keep a raid from breaking up :) <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
