<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiatek2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">THis may sound like a stupid question, but does this spell actually exist?  I have had friends and myself turn in an excess of 20 parchments and have never seen this spell.  I have also been watching the bazaar for months and months and never seen it for sale.  Something special about this spell that I never see it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

This spell is wonderful.  I use it a LOT, and it doesn't suffer at all from Breath of Ro's excess fizzling and resists.  And since it's evocation, it's my DoT of choice now.<br />
<br />
Of course, as soon as I ding 63, and actually get swarming death, that may change =)<br />

Other than the scroll has a different name than the spell?  The scroll you're looking for is named &quot;Fury of Ro&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, they forgot to change the name of the scroll?<br />
<br />
Yeah, that would explain it too.  I see 7 copies of it for sale in the bazaar on my server, at prices ranging from 45pp to 200pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, the scroll is still called 'fury of ro', which is dumb if you ask me. I believe that there is a bard song that has the same problem.</div></div><hr />
