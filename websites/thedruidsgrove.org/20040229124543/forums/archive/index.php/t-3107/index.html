<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure a lot of people already know about this but there's a head slot item with IH4 that is pretty easy to get and is a semi-common drop. For druids in high end PoP guilds or VT, this is trivial but for the casual player this item is awesome:<br />
<br />
 <br />
Polished Smoothmetal Torque <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: HEAD<br />
AC: 12<br />
STA: +8 WIS: +8 HP: +65 MANA: +65<br />
SV MAGIC: +10 SV POISON: +10<br />
Recommended level of 50.<br />
Focus: Improved Healing IV<br />
WT: 1.0 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: CLR DRU SHM<br />
Race: ALL<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Drops off PoI Manaetic Prototypes, which take about 18 so so equipped people (give or take) to kill. I *think* they are a 3 day spawn (although could be 5), banish and rampage but are otherwise very easy. <br />
<br />
They have 2 ae's: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1076&amp;source=Live&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Oil Spray&lt;/a&gt; (ae snare - unresistable) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1074&amp;source=Live&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Steam Blast&lt;/a&gt; (ae 800 dd - fire check). <br />
<br />
They are slowable and have relatively low resist checks (fire and cold both land with debuffs)<br />
<br />
The biggest issue is that they banish the person on the top of their hate list to the other prototype rooms so healers need to do some /assist healing. It helps to have a SOS rogue along to CR those that get banished.<br />
<br />
We get 1-2 of the helms per clearing along with other minor loot which usually rots. But for the effort, you really can't go wrong. IH4 makes our already great spell Nature's Infusion basically equal to TR without the 10s casting time. <br />
<br />
Anyway, like I said, this is trivial for high end druids but thought I'd get the word out for those casual druids that want to improve their healing.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, I'm not going to see the ceramic totem anytime soon.  I've already been given liquefied earth, but last I've heard earth mephit blood is still extremely rare.  My server's two elemental planes enabled guilds still have a ways to go before they're done using earth mephit blood for themselves, I think.  I have no idea about the shattered crystal.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Ornate basically doesn't exist.  BPs are somewhat gettable, legs somewhat less gettable, and the other peices are just so rare as to be non-existant.<br />
 <br />
  Got 4 AA points in the pit in tactics today, 2 ethereal, 1 named spawned the entire time (was 2 groups there too.)  At this rate I'd break 100AA points just to get my ethreal spells in tactics.  It's such a putrid drop rate it needs fixed.  We've gotten a bunch of legs and BPs off minis, but having killed hundreds and hundreds of blue named in BoT and seeing a total of 1 pattern I just don't give a @#%$ if named spawn.  Hell people often completely ignore them and just pull other stuff if they're camping a wing anymore.  It's really really stupid.  There is probably several times the elemental armor on servers as there is ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sglanton33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you are close to elemental zones, it would be best to wait.<br />
Leather elemental is such a common drop its unreal. (save leggings and BP of course)<br />
The stats of the elemental armor is just mind boggling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quaras Shadowscythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lindara -- check BOT -- the drop rates are much better on ornate leather patterns.  I was in shock when mine dropped for the sleeves...and it has been a huge boost.  I have seen a lot more patterns coming out of BOT mini-named (not Tower Named) than any other zone.  Since I do not have recourse to the elemental stuff...it was the best option for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sglanton33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my post was only for those that do have the Elemental zone option. <br />
I do understand 95% of the druids dont have access.<br />
There is nothing wrong with the Wanderers Sylvain armor, provided you can get it to drop.<br />
To pay for it, I have seen the BP for 200k and the legs for 90k..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A friend of mine told me this is a triggered event. Is that the case? Also, does killing IV spawn V, or are they all up at the same time?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Teaa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nope, not triggered. They spawn every few days and they all have the same name. There's no progression. Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After months of pushing this, I finally got a raid down there this evening and it dropped!  Only two of three were up and we got one of each item from loot table (lucky us!).<br />
<br />
I am much happier wiht my new cap , thanks again for this thread.  :D</div></div><hr />
