<br />
What are good food/flasks/potions etc to take on a raid as  feral tank?<br />
<br />
A few of the best for each would be nice but the best possible is good enough as well.  Just trying to farm/stock up in my down time so that come raid time I am good to go and not running around trying to gather stuff at the last min.</div></div><hr />

I gear towards Agi and Armor, while getting as much stam as possible. So, I rely on raid buffs to bring up my stamina, and a flask to hit the crit reduction cap. Thus, I use a flask and 20 or 30 stam food. However, when I get my last piece of T5 and reach the armor cap (almost there--will need some BT loot to make it), I'll start swapping some gems for stamina, and then I'll use an Agi Elixir and 30 Resilience Elixir.<br />
<br />
Need Stam:<br />
Flask of Fortification (500 Health, 10 Defense Rating, Flask)<br />
Elixir of Major Fortitude (250 Health, 10 HP/5, Guardian)<br />

There's a -lot- of different Stam foods. You can either get a 30 Stam food (Fisherman's Feast, Spicy Crawdad) or 20 Stam food (Mok'Nathol Shortribs, Feltail Delight, Talbuk Steak, Clam bar, etc.)<br />
<br />
Need Dodge:<br />
Elixir of Major Agility (35 Agi, Battle)<br />
Elixir of Mastery (15 All stats, Battle)<br />
Warp Burger (20 Agi, Food)<br />

Elixir of Major Defense (550 Armor, Guardian)<br />
Earthen Elixir (Reduces all damage by 20, Guardian) [I've only heard of it, and I don't know how many, if any, actually use it]<br />
<br />
Reaching Crit Reduction Cap:<br />
Flask of Fortification (500 Health, 10 Defense Rating, Flask)<br />
