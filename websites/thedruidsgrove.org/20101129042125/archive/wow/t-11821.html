<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azreell</div><div class="date">06-07-2007, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure everyone is already aware of the new trinket change which will allow pretty much anymore to trinket out of cyclone once every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Now 1v1 - I will be frank. This isn't a big deal to us at all. World pvp (if any exists anymore) we are still as viable as ever.<br />
<br />
But, My issue and the issue of many druids is arenas. Even before this patch if you look at the armory and arena stats - the druid populus has the absolute lowest presence in top rated teams of any class.<br />
<br />
The druid populus also has the lowest presence of any class in arena games in general.<br />
<br />
Druid pvp in terms of grouping has always been weak. I will admitt we for quite some time now have been a solo class. But, The problem in TBC is blatant as blizzard has based all pvp around group - gamplay. They have also stated that balance is centered around group gameplay as well (which I'm not so sure I'd agree with this atm ).<br />
<br />
Currently druids are the weakest link in any area. I love my class but I am realistic. We do fairly well in 2v2 and 3v3's atm due to the utility of cyclone. With that spell now diminished I really can see us hurting in those brackets real soon also.<br />
<br />
5v5 There is no place for us. In the top 10 5v5 teams there was 1 druid - that is it. Simply we have no group synergy.<br />
<br />
Another issue arises with the pvp system - Imo wow has dumbed down pvp and strategy. Some classes were designed around the idea of CC. It took actual though process to time move cycles and some skill to win. With the current paladin/warrior problem and now the new trinkets - wow pvp will be heavily based on how many plate classes you can bring.<br />
<br />
I will go into how IMO this implements each spec:<br />
<br />
1)Resto - Hots are great but lets face it. Druids were never burst damage healers. Hots smooth out the burst damage allowing other faster type healers to be able to heal. It's rediculously easy to nullify a resto druids healing ability. You do not even have to kill the resto druid. Sick one dps class on him make him go into bear and all healing for himself and his groupmates stops. Cyclone gave us some breathing room were we could still be somewhat viable.<br />
<br />
2)Balance - You guys have had it tough for awhile. The whole battle mage thing was a complete failure. You do great dps but have low survivability and little to no spell interrupts minus cyclone if it's used that way.<br />
<br />
3)Feral - Well were do I begin. Druids of all specs have the slowest primary heal in game. Healing touch even talented is 3seconds. Cyclone gave us room in groups to do minimal CC since root has bordered on usefull for some time now and do some dmg/heal.  Why not just bring a MS warrior for the debuff or a rogue with more utility now vs us?<br />
<br />
This is not a QQ post by any means. But, As I said we had one saving grace in arenas and that was cyclone.<br />
<br />
If this trinket change goes live I would really expect wow to give druids of all specs some group pvp buffs since quite frankly there is not a single reason to bring one even now without the cyclone change and after it will be worse.<br />
<br />
Now I know some people will argue it's only used once every 2 minutes etc etc. But keep in mind - feral druids in groups have little room for error. I don't know how many matches I've won with a clinch cyclone being cast at the last second.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind - Paladins now are back to the same rediculous state they were in prior. THe warrior/paladin combo just got the biggest buff in existance for the arena. THis I don't undertand as arena stats has shown they are already a top set-up team and wins in that bracket while druids , rogues and hunters to a lesser extent are at the bottom.<br />
<br />
I really just don't understand blizzard logic. As I stated alot of classes were designed around certain CC ideals. This change will basically mean rebalancing every class for pvp as the arena stats will show how detrimental this change will be.<br />
<br />
In closing my cocern for our class is quite honestly there is now no reason to bring a druid to a 5v5,3v3, or 2v2 vs another class.<br />
<br />

It's quite obvious that druids are pretty weak in group PvP just because we are more suited to PvE (imo). The new trinket will increase the frequency when our CC spell is nullified so as a result it hurts our arena viability even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some high-end PvE-ers on my realm claims skilled restos are the best healers in the game. I don't have enough flesh on my bones to do a comparison myself though. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">06-08-2007, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm, can someone actually explain the trinket change<br />
to me, i havent read anywhere about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduan</div><div class="date">06-08-2007, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically it comes down to this with the trinket change.<br />
<br />
If it goes live as it is written in the beta patch notes....<br />
<br />
ANYTHING that slows, hinders, stops or takes control of your toon and you can not dispell it the trinket will.  This includes, snares, traps, sap, blind, Deathcoil, cyclone, gouge, hamstring etc etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I disagree with this to an extent.<br />
<br />
Resto are good healers but they are the furthest thing from burst dmg healing.<br />
<br />
Healing touch talented still takes 3 seconds to cast.<br />
<br />
NS is on a 3 minute cooldown<br />
<br />
Swiftmend is nice but 15 second cooldown and even if it crits its only a cpl k heal.<br />
<br />
Druids lack a 1.5 second heal which puts them behind on burst healing ability vs other classes.<br />
<br />
As far as the trinket change - It eliminates all CC including cyclone if used.  Look at the paladin/warrior combo issue now.<br />
<br />
Paladin can break first cyclone our next one is only 3 seconds and last one is only 1.5 seconds. <br />
<br />
Then he can even bubble.<br />
<br />
What happened is they just gave the plate train classes in 2v2 even more of an advantage and thus my concern since 2v2 and 3v3 is where most druids play since as I said 5v5 we offer little to nothing in terms of group synergy.<br />
<br />
As I said 1v1 this doesn't impact us at all but really how much 1v1 pvp is there left? Everything is bgs and arenas which is where we are the weakest.<br />
<br />
Imo a simple fix if they change this would be to increase cyclones duration to 12, 6 , 3.....<br />
<br />
Cyclone suffers the most harsh DR of any cc spell and is very limited in duration - this trinket change really cripples it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduan</div><div class="date">06-08-2007, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will be curious to see how it plays out to be honest.  Yes I agree it will hurt but perhaps maybe not as bad as it seems.<br />
<br />
Someone made a good point on the board..now what it will do is force them(the target of the cyclone) to think when to use their trinket.  If you can force them to use it, say if you with a rogue with blind/sap etc then they are open to be cycloned just like before.  With a lock fear them to burn it..look at yoru partner and see if you can use his best(meaning little to no DR CC that can be reapplied with ease) first to get teh target to trinket.<br />
<br />
Granted this all sounds easier when writing it then it does when trying to actually pull it off.  Plus I am still new to druid and pvp so I am not an expert by far but just some things a friend and I talked about last night as we are thinking of teaming up for 2 vs 2 teams for fun.  Me a druid him a lock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with this to an even further extent.<br />
<br />
I guess we define burst healing different you and me.</div></div><hr />

Bursthealing2 = 2.5 sec cast for 7K crit? Thats a Pally with Holy light..<br />

OH... and the druid wins.</div></div><hr />

On the whole, I feel that the warrior/druid combination will probably be a bit better than it was before the trinket change. The only thing that worries me is warstomp + cyclone against melee. Not really sure I will be able to stop them from killing me after the change.<br />
<br />
In 5v5, I agree -- we suck now and post-trinket, you might as well replace us with a stuffed bunny decoy, which would at least confuse the enemy.</div></div><hr />
