At point point I die and rez at the gold mine.<br />
<br />
I go down the hill and see a tauren hunter defending the flag against an NE hunter.  Each has a pet attacking the other on the Tauren hunter is at half health.<br />
<br />
Being the dutiful druid that I am, I put two HoTs on my hunter, root the pet so she/he can step away, then drop into Bear and Feral Charge the NE hunter and the battle proceeds from there.<br />
<br />
I don't remember what happened next (I think the NE hunter had 3 friends show up) but the next thing I see in raid chat the Tauren hunter:<br />
<br />
Hunter:  wtf drood...heal!<br />
<br />
Thinking this person might be one of those who thinks the only good druid is a resto druid, I reply:<br />
<br />
Me: &lt;-- not ur personal healer<br />
Hunter: so attack then, but don't just stand there.<br />
Me: I did attack.  Pay attention.<br />
<br />
Maybe I can equip this next time in my off hand:  :iamwithst <br />
<br />
It made me mad yesterday, but now it makes me giggle.  Ah, the joys of being a PvP druid.  :)</div></div><hr />

If you only had 1 hunter guarding the flag then he was just pissed that it was overrun by a lack of team effort. You just happened to be there (whether you did your job or not). I know I get frustrated when the BG leader calls for all defend and I see all those dots on the map start moving towards an opposing force held flag..leaving 1-2 guys to defend and I hear myself going %^$-&amp;^$*($ you ^%*&amp;*# little ^%&amp;*$^#*@&amp;. <br />
So don't let it bother you. If what you said was true, then the only thing I would have done different was sleep the pet and root/mf the hunter and gone Kitty on his ass.</div></div><hr />

I have a level 14 hunter so I don't know - are certain pets immune to Hibernate?  Is there a way to know in advance if it won't work or do you just cast it and see?</div></div><hr />

If you see a hunter pet get bigger and turn red, yea, don't bother trying to CC him in any way, that's the 31 pt hunter talent in BM.<br />
<br />
But any hunter can train his pet with 120 Nature Resists, it just requires like 1/3 of the total training points available to get it up that high.<br />
<br />
I'm an engineer, and if I really need to shut down a hunter pet, and hibernate is resisted, I'll throw a scare beast bomb. I've only done that a few times, but for you engineers it's another option if the hunter trained up his pet's nature resists.<br />
<br />
To the OP, I don't let it bother me when people complain that I didn't heal them. I'd either say what you said, or say I'm a feral druid and I never learned the healing spells, or that maybe if you would get some stamina gear you wouldn't die before my heal could finish, or something like that. But in the same vein that it's annoying when peeps complain you didn't heal them, it sure feels good when people compliment and thank you when your heals make a difference and someone notices. I and another were healing a lv 51 rogue through midfield the other day, and I think he may have had an accident he was so elated as he ran through a heavy assault unscathed.</div></div><hr />
