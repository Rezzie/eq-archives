I respect Resto druids more than ever with them demolishing a few of my &quot;decked&quot; characters and my druid is now 61 and I am starting to decide on whether to go full Resto.<br />
<br />
My question if you would:<br />
<br />
If you are full Resto and good at pvp- what skills/abilities are you using to kill me exactly? I know my mage unleashes like 6k dmg up front and the Resto druid absorbed it and then took me out fast (I have 10400 hps) but didn't get to look at the combat log to figure out how he was able to do that. Are Resto Druids pretty powerful spell-wise? <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for enlightening me!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stealth in Cat Form.<br />
Watch your partner get targetted.<br />
HoT up your partner.<br />
Paint a big bulls-eye on yourself.<br />
HoT yourself.<br />
Go Bear.<br />
Take a sh!t-ton of damage while in Bear Form.<br />
Watch your partner take out the opposing healer.<br />
Heal your partner when the last opponent focuses on him/her.<br />
Collect S3 Epix.<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
It's a pretty simple description, but it's pretty much the basis of Resto Arena. Everyone else adds in their own play-style but that's how it usually works.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a hard time, as I have some decent PVE (and one PVP) epic gear, and am completely feral.  Since almost all of my gear is feral-related, its tough to respec to resto, but some part of me wants to since druids are such insanely great healers in BGs and arenas.<br />
<br />
Much to ponder...</div></div><hr />

I 1v1ed a hunter when my warlock buddy killed a mage, but he died as well. So this hunter was down to 40% and i moon fired and insected him to death.</div></div><hr />

Took him about 30 min, but he ended up winning with moonfire and hitting him with his staff =/<br />
<br />
We were playing a frost mage and mace combat HARP rogue, and my druid lagged, so the mage and rogue were able to burn me down.  I took out the rogue, and got my full dots on the mage.  When my druid un-lagged, I was dead, and the mage was eating / drinking through my dots.  Druid would MF then run while the mage chased him.  Eventually the mage would go to drink, and my Druid would come back and moonfire him again then run away.  Mage went through three evocates, three invis drink to fulls, and my druid drank to full twice and innervated two times.  <br />
<br />
It was a ridculous slow death, but we ended up winning.  All of 11 points.  Then we queued and waited 10 minutes to start a new match while laughing at the mage.  Best part was he was from our server and got out of the arena in shatt right next to us and promptly sat down and logged off :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
despite a couple of people telling me its easy points / epix.<br />
<br />
but am interested reading this in the abilities of a resto talent specced druid in pvp/arena....<br />
<br />
how many HP / Mana self MOTW buffed would a reasonable geared resto have for running team arena?<br />
<br />
combination of blues and some epix - ie not one whose raided everywhere and fully epix T4+ decked out....<br />
<br />
my healing gear is somewhat cr4p and outdated given i'm fuilly feral and have not really bothered to improve since i started playing wow again in late Nov.<br />
<br />
so if i put on my healing gear i have about 6600HP and 9500 mana.  and about 0 resilience which i understand you need a lot of for doing arena/bg's ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your best bet is to get in a BG of the week Premade on the weekends as feral and farm honor to buy the S1 Healing gear.  Should only take you a few weeks.  With the S1 stuff gemmd and enchanted your survivabiligy will be way up - higher sta, heal and resil - and arenas will start being a lot of fun.  <br />
<br />
Don't get discouraged if you get blown up early on by players in full S3.  It happens.  Eventually, you'll be decked in epics that are on par more or less with T4 stuff, and having a good time.</div></div><hr />
