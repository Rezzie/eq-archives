There are two paths to go, L60+. It doesnt matter which one you go first, you can always do the second one later (or concurrently).<br />
<br />
Druids have ports to Blightfire, Direwind and The Steepes. Druids also get Translocates for these three zones as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanre</div><div class="date">09-16-2006, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are merchants at the three druid rings that sell the spells for those rings.<br />
<br />
Start off in PoK and use the Crescent Reach Stone. This drops you off in Blightfire Moors not far from the Bixies. Follow the road west to the Crossroads Camp (note: All 9 Wizard port spells are sold at the camp by Kulvinia Brighflame at -140, 580) then Northwest to the Druid Ring.<br />
<br />
Grey Peacebloom sells the 3 Blightfire port spells for ~210 each. <br />
His loc is (360, 1360)<br />
<br />
From Grey Peacebloom, head Northeast till you hit a road, follow that North past the dead dragon being eaten by Sporali till you hit Goru'kar Mesa.<br />
<br />
In Goru'kar Mesa follow the river West then North untill you approach the third bridge. Strike off Northwest overland through the Giants till you see a chasm with spooky looking skull things to either side. Enter the chasm to get to The Steppes.<br />
<br />
In The Steppes strike off overland along the Eastern edge of the zone until you get to the Druid Ring.<br />
<br />
Emilia Daeren sells the 3 Steppes port spells for ~210 each.<br />
Her loc is (500, -1300)<br />
<br />
Head back South to Goru'kar Mesa<br />
<br />
Follow the northern edge of Goru'Kar Mesa going East untill you see 2 Serpentine Pillars. Pass between them to get to Sunderock Springs.<br />
<br />
In Sunderock Springs head West until you get to the river then follow it North along the Eastern bank. Just as you approach the second waterfall, strike off overland to the Northeast. You will pass under a natural looking bridge and might see Randalph the Wise roaming the area.<br />
<br />
As you pass under the bridge, hook to the Northwest to enter Direwind Cliffs. Be careful around here as there is a roaming raid dragon named Mistwalker. Does not see invis so keep camo up.<br />
<br />
As you zone in to Direwind Cliffs, the Druid Ring is almost within sight to the Northwest<br />
Tienen the Wanderer sells the 3 Direwind port spells for ~210 each.<br />
His loc is (-1260, -20)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Only suggestion would make is add a line to find Direwind Cliffs, and that is to go UP the first waterfull until get to the second one.   I made a right at first waterfall trying to get around and ended up back at zoneline since thought the waterfall was a boundary and couldn't go up - whoops!<br />
 <br />
There are a lot of spots in these zones that would appear to be a zone boundary but in fact are just a large wall, waterfall, etc that you can climb over.</div></div><hr />

It is showing 60-70 and I would suggest calling it 65-75 (or maybe even 70+)</div></div><hr />

The Steppes teleportation spells cost 26p 2g 4s, 9c each.<br />
The Blightfire Moors teleporation spells cost 52p 4g 9s 9c each.<br />
<br />
That gives a grand total of 269p 3g 1s 6c.<br />
<br />
You must have a really poor charisma if they cost you that much, or they lowered the prices between the time of your post and mine :) My charisma is 270.</div></div><hr />
