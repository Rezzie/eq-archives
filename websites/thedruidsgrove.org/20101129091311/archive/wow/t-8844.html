Just wondering where you get trained for Enchanting?<br />
And is it a good way to make money?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amerylla</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can train enchanting at any of the major cities, just speak with the guards.  They will put a note on your map, as they will for many NPC's.<br />
<br />
As far as making money, I'm far from someone to ask about that, I never seem to have much coin at all but I suppose it would be much like any profession.. put some time and effort into it and yes you could make some coin.  I suspect some of the uber enchants could net you some cash too should you find yourself in possession of one of those recipies.  Take a look at some of the prices on AH for dust, essence etc.  There seems to be a pretty penny selling those.<br />
<br />
I was told when I first took Enchanting as a profession I would go broke working up the skills, but it is possible to farm for the items to DE.  Also, find someone who is skilling up in Tailoring, you can pass off cloth (linen, wool, silk, etc) and a bit of spare coin for mats and have them pass you back items that will DE.  I've not found a place yet where there was not a recipie using only dust that would skill me up.  Granted, I'm only to 218 yet, but I'm really enjoying the profession.<br />
<br />
Good Luck with it!</div></div><hr />

Can someone buy enchanting formulas for you? For example, if someone is exalted (or revered, i forget) with Thorium Brotherhood, can that person buy the +22int enchant for another enchanter?</div></div><hr />

Faction-based enchants are BoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Send her some stacks of linen cloth in the mail.  Put it COD for 30s.  Worst case scenario is you get your linen back 3 days later.  Best case scenario, you get 30s back instead.  :)<br />

<br />
I enchant their items, and in doing so, raise my skill but run out of  mats. So the next time we go to a dungeon, I simply ask them if I can greed all the uncommons for enchanting supplies. I usually walk away with 30+ Strange Dust, and tons more.</div></div><hr />
