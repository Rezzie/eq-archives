This is task one:<br />
<br />
Upon entering the zone You pick up the sphere. Proceed to work way to the Named mob that drops the alpha meat and turn it in to the named mechanical mob (excuse me for not listing npc's name) who then hands you a gem.<br />
<br />
You get the message that your task is completed.<br />
<br />
Head back to Bellfast and hand him the gem and sphere. He than thanks you for helping.<br />
<br />
I looked at my quest journal and it says completed 0/1 of this part.<br />
<br />
Any clue what I have done wrong? I petitioned of course no help there. They suggested I send a /bug which I have but who knows if that will ever be fixed. No one in my party got credit which leaves me to believe that I am doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Nimchip you said &quot;loot&quot; did  you loot the gem from the named or hand in meat to get gem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nimchip you said &quot;loot&quot; did  you loot the gem from the named or hand in meat to get gem?<br />
???<br />
<br />
There are 2 stones, 1 is on the ground right when you zone in. Pick it up and you get a checkmark or whatever... Then go and kill Big Robognome and loot the other. Anyone can loot them. <br />
<br />
Hand in meat??  We didn't have to do anything with a meat, and i did this like 3 times already for guildies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First time I did it the way you did (alpha meat is a no drop item btw) thought maybe that's why I didnt get credit. Next time I did it they way its written on Alla and still no luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drithius</div><div class="date">11-13-2005, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way you're supposed to do this mission is 1) zone in, pick up ground spawn 2) kill Alpha Larva, loot meat 3) Hail Clicktok for final gem<br />
<br />
Handin to Belfast is completely optional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">11-13-2005, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once again, all we did was... pick up ground spawn, kill giant robognome, loot... mission done.</div></div><hr />
