<br />
I'm currently trying to come up with some minimum stat requirements for starting into T5 content as a druid.  I'm good on the resto side of things.  But I haven't been feral since we cleared Karazhan, so if you guys could weigh in it'd really help me out.<br />
<br />
My assumptions are that no gear is needed from any T4 instance, and that any pre-2.4 badge loot or reputation rewards that are upgrades have been purchased.  I'm also assuming that all gear has been properly gemmed and enchanted.<br />
<br />
That having been said, is it unreasonable to expect the druid to have 15k hit points and 35-40% dodge in bear form?<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone has any armour numbers for this level of gear, that'd really help me out.  I know that when Pookies was just 2/5 T4 he was already at almost 30k.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, druids!</div></div><hr />

Thanks a lot!  Any input as far as the unbuffed HP and dodge go?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For most of the T5 content I was sitting on around 17k-18k health raidbuffed, crit capped, about 28k armor and 40% dodge.  Looking back, I could easily have done it with less gear if I'd needed to.  With that said, I was rarely asked to main-tank anything (I am pretty much a career cat druid).<br />
<br />
Speaking of T5, have you decided what to do in terms of your 2pc tier 4 bonus for cat dps?<br />
I'd recommend deciding that earlier than later, so you can plan your item purchases.<br />
<br />
I went for T4 hat and chest.  Hat I can turn off, and I wear the lower city tabard to cover the chest (hate the look of T4).  I'm going to try to end up with T5 shoulders and legs (the most visual parts - I love the look of T5), and finally Vengeful Gladiator's Gloves, for the bonus to maim.<br />
<br />
You need to keep 2pc Tier 4 bonus for cat dps to remain viable.  Black Temple cat druids wear 2pc T4 too.<br />

That carries even into/through Sunwell.<br />

Only reason to divert from that is for asthetic reasons, which seems kinda silly.</div></div><hr />

All shiny and plasticky baubly and fake crappy looking like some cheapy garden lamp.  It's like a pair of giant glowing nipple-less boobs growing out my shoulders.  Thank god for cat form.  Need to kill Void Reaver again...<br />

<br />
T6 &gt; T4 = T3 &gt; T5<br />
<br />
Of course, they'd probably grow on me ... at first I also hated the shoulders I'm wearing now (the 60 badge ones), but I don't mind 'em so much anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the animation on the T5 shoulders, and the whole colour scheme and just everything about the look of Nordrassil.  The Malorne shoulders by contrast I think look like a pair of garden lamps.  Totally non-druidy and boob-like.  :p<br />

The only boss that requires a really well-geared bear tank is morogrim, but for that you should likely be looking at 4pT4 because of the +1400 armor bonus it provides along with the extra rage. For hydross base stats aren't important; armor doesn't matter and resistance is more important than anything other than uncrittability. For lurker you could be in Kara-level gear and be fine. For Leo it's mostly about threat, not about gear. <br />
<br />
Hmm. Depends on what you're doing for FLK. If you're not well-geared and try and tank the shaman, you're in for a world of hurt. You could likely do okay with the hunter though. <br />
<br />
I seriously doubt you'll be anywhere near armor-capped unless you've done something very squirrelly with your gear. 30k is a good benchmark to aim for. After that, it's as much stam as possible.</div></div><hr />

Wow, thanks a lot kalbear, your response was very much appreciated!  :)</div></div><hr />
