I've never done UP or Oculus, but CoS is really easy even on heroic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CoS - Get yourself a couple of AoE dps and CoS is way fun<br />
Oculus - first part is not too bad, last boss is different - dragon vehicle based combat<br />
UP - not terribly difficult except for the gauntlet.  can be rough<br />
HoL - last boss is a beyotch to heal.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm. then again, I think I've only done HoL on heroic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we're going to try to run a few normals now we've done a couple finally getting my Elders !<br />
<br />
want to try to do the lvl 80 ones so we all at least get rep before we start some heroics.<br />
<br />
i'm really rusty on tanking 5 mans tbh. so a bit more normal practice will help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-06-2009, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well finally managed to do a 5 man last nite !  :clap: <br />
<br />
be trying all week but something always happened.<br />
<br />
decided to try a normal HoL as one of my guildies knew it well where as myself and the other guildie had never been ! 'discovered halls of lightning' !<br />
<br />
so 3 of us lvl 80s - me feral, dps DK and a Holy Pally.<br />
<br />
we found 2 more in LFG. a 77 DK and a 78 hunter. no i had absolutely no idea if these 2 were of an ok level for HoL ?  nor a clue at their gear.<br />
<br />
but what the heck - i had baby free time for a 5 man and was after some rep mainly not even loot tbh - lthough i did win 3 BoE greens for d/e and got a new blue staff which was a slight upgrade over my one (from some quest ages back). just gotta chuck the titanium chain thing onto it now.<br />
<br />
seemed a smooth run to start. i was not having issues on keeping aggro on 3 or so mobs. swipe being king !  we even maanged to pull the (first?) boss too early - the one where other mobs are charging him with lightning  - yet still took him down fine.<br />
<br />
unfortunately as happens in pugs suddenly the hunter pipes up i have to go soon to Mt Hyjal !  so just as we get to a boss i'm told is 'tricky' he leaves us.  so we're down to 4 and not a lot of chance of getting someone into a normal at the 3rd boss !<br />
<br />
we decided to have a go with the 4 of us. no 2 of us (healer and tank) had never been here so did not have a clue.  first attempt we got the damn ba&amp;*&amp;rd down to having 7.6k HP - yes 7600hp !!, remaining before we all died cos the healer had got d/c during the fight and i was not getting heals :(<br />
<br />
also we were a bit slow running away from them little lightning things, plus the 77 DK died early so it was a 3 man fight that became 2 man when the healer d/c !<br />
<br />
2nd time we took him down easily....i threw a few heals onto the Pally healer whilst running away from the lightning things plus an innervate.<br />
<br />
we finally get to the last boss - whom i realised was a quest i had ;) and was being told this could be tricky but lets just go for it.  meanwhile a raiding mage i know who helped me do the Elder achievement was offering to give me the tactics. i said wait til we die then tell me :p<br />
<br />
but we took him down 1st time with little trouble as a grp of 4. :)  <br />
<br />
It was a really fun little run and reminded me why i enjoy the game. did not get as much rep as i was expecting but only 50 for a boss and 5 on most trash.<br />
<br />
hoping to go to a heroic tonite with the raiding mage.<br />
<br />
i need to look back through my 'which heroic' thread later. hoping we can give VH a shot for a helm and the staff ofc :)<br />
<br />
i'd like to do CoS due to those nice gloves (the ones which got a nerf?) which are I believe from a quest ?<br />
<br />
as you can see i'm easily pleased......compared to you lot running multi heroics and 10 and 25 man Naax etc each week :tongue:</div></div><hr />

U want to put WHAT on your tanking weapon? <br />
That makes me :cry: <br />
Just use another enchant PLZ PLZ PLZ :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
its another blue staff rather than something worth one of the top enchants which i'm saving for the staff of trickery.<br />
<br />
so i see it as an ok enchant for now.</div></div><hr />

I think the quest actually starts inside the instance.</div></div><hr />
