5% per level over cap, instead of 10%. Nice.</div></div><hr />

Say you have a level 70 ice focus that raises ice nuke damage by 30%. 10% degradation would mean it is a 15% focus at level 75, 5% means it is a 22% or 23% (not sure if they round up or down). At level 80 with 10% that focus would be 0, 5% degradation would give you a 15% focus. <br />
 <br />
At 10% degradation any focus will be half it's strength 5 levels above cap and 0 at 10 levels, at 5% 5 levels above cap gives you 75% of your original focus and at 10 levels your focus would be half it's strength.</div></div><hr />

The single group armor exceed what is available in demi, and the focii while being less power, will work full force.</div></div><hr />
