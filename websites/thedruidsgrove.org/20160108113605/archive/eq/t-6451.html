However, in EQ, I do not find enjoyment in screwing over my fellow players or being screwed over by them.  I feel that EQ has fostered just this type of environment.  Some of the behaviour I see people exhibit in this game would get them flattened if not outright shot or driven out of town if they behaved that way in real life.<br />
<br />
*Edit: Bleah, can't change vote.  I was going to say other because I enjoy the competition of figuring out a quest or organizing a group of individuals toward a common goal but NOT to the detriment of others and not to do something before everyone else can or to have the best loot.  However, I don't think that's the sort of thing you meant here.</div></div><hr />

Although, I suppose being the first to find a quest is sort of PvP but maybe via the message forums. <br />
<br />
My hypothesis was competition in EQ really isn't appealing to most people and it looks like the numbers are bearing that out.  I think the people who love it would probably be better off on a PvP server.  And those of us who dislike it don't enjoy having it thrust on us by those that want it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Romidar</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In EQ, the only person I want to compete with is myself. I want to be able to tell that I am more powerful now than I was a month ago -that is it. I actually played the first Diablo to 50th level (that took a HUGE amount of time, actually); further, I did it solo - there was NO competition with other players.<br />
<br />
I play EQ to relax and unwind and as a &quot;together&quot; activity with my wife. We love LDoN, in large part, because we don't have to deal with competing for hunting grounds, spawns, etc. I absolutely hate that element of the game.<br />
<br />
I do like other competitive games, but only ones in which there is a level playing field. Everyone who plays chess plays with the same set of rules - the only thing that determines the winner is the skill of the players. I enjoyed playing Quake deathmatch immensely, for example - some players were just BETTER than me (watching a real expert play was amazing, and I was pretty good myself).<br />
<br />
In EQ there is, I'm sorry to say, very little skill involved - which makes competition meaningless to me. The fact that I have better equipment than someone who plays half the time I do means... what, exactly? Should I feel somehow &quot;better&quot; because I can spend more time playing?<br />
<br />
I will never be as good as Gary Kasparov no matter how much time I spend playing chess. I will never play violin as well as, uh, insert some famous violin player. Those people have skill and talent, which makes them worthy of admiration - they can do something that I cannot. I can't imagine looking up to (or wanting to be) the person who has more leisure time or is more willing to play with people they don't like in order to reach some goal. (At the same time, I don't mind their getting more rewards for it - their equipment just doesn't mean anything to me.)<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm a person who plays RPG's for the RP element of it. I try to play a good paladin in EQ even though there's very little RP value to the game. I get more pleasure from helping someone do a CR and rezzing them than I do from any of the equipment on my back.<br />
<br />
I don't envy the designers of EQ. It's a broad enough game that many different people who enjoy different things can get some fun out of it. My only problem is when the game starts to be tailored to one particular style of play (as PoP was). LDoN did balance PoP out nicely, IMHO, except for the droppable loot (where the quality of the dropped item is far, far below what anyone who could win the items would want).</div></div><hr />

Yup, these are the kinds I like and friendly competitions on who can level faster or get a certain skill up faster.  I have never had the experience of racing to get enough people to get to a spawn, so can't speak to that.  Dueling can be fun, but usually only with friends.  Competing for equipment?  I guess in a little friendly competition, but that's all for me anyway.</div></div><hr />

Fighting another class is like oranges to apples, and fighting another anguish geared druid is freakin ridiculous at this level.<br />
 <br />
i'm all about better gear, though I've slipped in my brief 6 month retirement (brief in eq = light years, the kind that aren't a measure of distance).  I left numero uno druid on my server before the merges, so I'll always have that.  :smile:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">05-29-2007, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see... Have a long day at work, come home to unwind a little, kill some mobs in that camp out in the boonies to get your drop for your +1 Flame Tongue and... camps taken already... by uber raiders who need the drop for one of their alts as an upgrade, because they've got the uber gear already to camp here without any danger.<br />
<br />
Guess we're not gonna get that drop today.  Maybe we can go and build some faction in another zone then.<br />
<br />
How about you go and check raid targets and Ragewind is up, and you get your pitiful little raid force together, and head out to Devastation with 20+ non-uber peeps, fully raid buffed and rearing to go, and watch a group of Anguish geared 75's manaburn Ragewind down as you enter the zone, because they time the spawn and farm him like level 20 Necros farm skellies for bones chips.<br />
<br />
Competition for resources is what makes EQ suck, and why people play WoW.  Thank Karana for instant zones and common drops of decent gear for casual players.</div></div><hr />
