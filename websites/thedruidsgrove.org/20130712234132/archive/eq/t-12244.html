I know about the staple ones.  You know, the one your favorite shammie buddy is always whipping up.  DS, Haste, Shrink, SoW, all those.  But I've heard about a lot of other ones that I just haven't seen.  Like healing potions as well as a few others that I haven't seen yet.  There's the exp potion quest too, I still have mine, waiting on a goooood aa grind group to put that into use :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, what are some of the newer potions and where do you get em?</div></div><hr />

PoK, Crothus Creep.  Top of the line potions run near 40 plat each.</div></div><hr />

Clarity X is great when you have no chanter in your group and need that extra bit of mana regen.</div></div><hr />

I'll have to look at that one =D  Probably great for solo kiting too.  I hate being in the middle of a good grind and losing brain candy.  Downtime is the devil ;P<br />
<br />
But thanks for the info, I'll go take a look at those in a few minutes.  I'm eager to take a peek :)</div></div><hr />

These are vendor sold and alchemy made. If a Shaman is using them to skill up, you can find them cheaper on a Trader than in PoK.</div></div><hr />
