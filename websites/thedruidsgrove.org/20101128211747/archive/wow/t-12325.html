If so, are there any hunters in particular that you would allow this privelage?<br />
<br />
Would you let them tame you as cat, or bear, or whichever they liked? :&gt;<br />

A) only if it were of obvious advantage to both of us, and I could break out of the hunter's control as needed.<br />
B) Umm, not that I've grouped with personally. :-/<br />
C) Aquatic form FTW! No preference, really.<br />

From the Hunter's perspective, I once tamed a (badlands cat with travel form skin) and named it Illhorn after my druid character in the same guild.  I got a few good laughs when they realized what I'd done.  For some reason the healer was annoyed though. -shrug-</div></div><hr />

I'd be comfortable with a game mechanic that allowed AFK druids to be tamed by hunters.<br />
<br />
Or! Or: you get all the buffs a hunter's pet would get. Look in the hunter's BM-spec tree and tell me that would not be awesome. I dunno, make it a short duration/long cooldown thing. For some reason the healer was annoyed though. -shrug- Healer probably has Illhorn-specific healing macros. Makes sense if your feral druid was a MT. I know I'd be pissed if I made macros specifically for the guild MT and suddenly there was another character in the guild with the same name.</div></div><hr />

I know two very good hunters that I would gladly lend my cat or bear form to.  <br />
<br />
They are both especially talented in arenas, and whereas I am always healing, I'd like to watch myself actually pwn something for once.  :thumbup:</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I'd let them tame me in Bear form because I AM STRONG BARE and would protect them forevers.</div></div><hr />
