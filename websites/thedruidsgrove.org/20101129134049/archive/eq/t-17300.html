<br />
PARIS (AFP) - Internet auction house eBay has temporarily renamed the yellow stars it uses to evaluate sellers on its French site after a complaint that the symbol had anti-semitic connotations.<br />
<br />
The move came after French eBay user Dominique Bellamy wrote to the company earlier this month to point out that during World War II the Nazis made Jews wear a yellow star on their clothes as a discriminatory mark.<br />
<br />
His wife Francoise Bellamy told AFP Thursday that her husband &quot;refused to be be given a yellow star, even a virtual one.<br />
<br />
&quot;It brought back bad memories of the occupation&quot; of France by Germany during World War II, she said.<br />
<br />
eBay's star system is used to show how many positive ratings a buyer or seller has received from the site's users. The yellow star is the lowest of the 12-point scale, and a silver shooting star is the top score.<br />
<br />
On the company's French site the lowest rating was shown Thursday as a yellow star, but was listed as a &quot;first star&quot; (in French, &quot;premiere etoile&quot;).<br />
<br />
But on English language versions the lowest rank was still called the yellow star.<br />
<br />
eBay said in an email to AFP that &quot;the yellow star is part of a series of achievement stars that eBay users get. This system is used worldwide on all eBay sites.&quot;<br />
<br />
It said that &quot;no definitive change has been decided yet&quot; on future use in France of the yeollow star, and that &quot;there have been no such complaints in other countries.&quot;...and France surrenders (of course).<br />
<br />
It seems this plague is no longer contained within U.S. borders.  I wonder when German will be outlawed, because the Nazis spoke it, and people desperately want to prove to other people that they're not Nazis.</div></div><hr />

Political, almost sounds like polite.  Don't it?<br />
<br />
I'm sure the etymology is similar even.<br />
<br />
But even words that are the same as the same word, have different meanings.<br />
<br />
For example the word, mean.<br />
<br />
It could mean an average.  The mean house price is X.<br />
It could mean intention.  I meant to say that.<br />
It could mean demeanor.  I was mean.<br />
It could mean definition.  Mean means mean.<br />
<br />
To me, political means, that I do things, or you do things, that make people LIKE you, or at least support you.  So, in this regard it is like being polite, I suppose.  But not really.<br />
<br />
For example, if I am being political...I could say, &quot;I hate George Bush&quot;.  So that people who like to hate George Bush will like me.  But there is nothing polite about that.  I am just being political.<br />
<br />
Or I could say, &quot;I love African Americans&quot;.  Instead of saying, &quot;I love Negros&quot;.  Because we have been taught that people, especially Negros, will not like us if we use the word Negro.  Even though an African American is a Negro.  One is politically correct(meaning that people will like me), and one is not(people will think that I lynch Negros and burn Jews).  Even though they are just words that describe the same thing.</div></div><hr />
