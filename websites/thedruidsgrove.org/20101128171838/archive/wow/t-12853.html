In the end it wasn't impossible, this won't be either.  Mobs will be dropping a lot more money, remember.. :&gt;<br />

Yup.  Small chain bombing quest, I believe.  No panic necessary.   ;)</div></div><hr />

15K for grand caravan mammoth!  Wow.  Is that the one that can carry other people?  How fast is it?</div></div><hr />

I just read up on the mammoth yesterday: Giant Caravan Mammoth (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=44235)<br />
From the tooltip:<br />
Reins of the Grand Caravan Mammoth<br />
Binds when picked up<br />
Races: Human, Dwarf, Night Elf, Gnome, Draenei<br />
Requires Level 60<br />
Requires Riding (150)<br />
Use: Teaches you how to summon this mount.  This is a very fast three-person mount that carries vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd guess that the 'very fast' part means it will be standard epic mount speed, and yes, there is a separate Horde version for some reason.</div></div><hr />

We'll charge you 1000g to use a mount you already bought months ago because it was too hard for people to find the quest giver?  WTF?<br />
<br />
Haven't they heard of wowhead?  Or maybe guild mates?  Or general chat?  LFG? trade?  I think if you wanted your flying mount back you'd find quest chain.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it....it wasn't exactly easy to find the flying mount trainer in BC?  Especially since most (all??) players were lvl 70 well before they ever stepped foot in SMV.  How did we ever do it?  Though, later they did add a &quot;I don't talk to anyone and have no friends&quot; quest giver in Shat to direct you to SMV for your mount.</div></div><hr />

Other classes aren't like Druids.  If a warrior doesn't know something, rather than ask another warrior or be seen looking it up, they'll damn well pretend they do know!  in order to look Manly.  :p<br />
