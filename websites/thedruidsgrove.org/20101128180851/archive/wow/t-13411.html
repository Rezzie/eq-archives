<br />
ok so the mother in law is staying with us atm so i get a bit more time for wow....<br />
<br />
last nite I managed to get online at 6pm as she had Marshall and 6pm is the start of childrens bedtime hour on a satellite channel with a program called In the Night Garden.<br />
<br />
so i log on happily thinking i can get 3 heroics done tonite easily.....new tank we use was busy buy guildie DK will do that rather than his more recent dps role.....usual healer in OS25...but another healer i know well whose just changed from her old hunter main to healer priest will come. Although to be fair she is not an experienced healer, only having been 80 a matter of weeks but we we've done a few herocis with her before.<br />
<br />
Leaves us needing 2 pug people.....never good imho to need pure pug people you get too many numpties and heroic wannabees.....but i digress and get ahead of myself.....<br />
<br />
Now the daily is AN - piece of cake thinks I......we usually do that in under 30 mins.  then we can run a CoS or maybe Drak/Gun for a couple loot items people do actually still need.<br />
<br />
There just happen to to be 2 dps in LFM, a mage (always good for water and int ! we dont usually run with a mage these days as all raid to much) and a lock (do good dps, got pet/s buffs and have some aoe).<br />
<br />
These days i always try to check out pug dps on wow heroes before we invite. i dont always get the chance as i am not always inviting - hence the other worst thread below :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
look at the mage - full set of epics, good spellpower and HP/Mana. No problem alt-tab back to the game quick to inv him !<br />
<br />
check out the lock - not to bad...a few epics but mainly blues. about 1200 spellpower. could be worse could be better and i have to admit to knowing nothing about locks so I am thinking he can probably do good damage and still brings the pet to the group - given that DK's in gear no better who tank can still do almost as much dps as me :(<br />
<br />
We start and it goes wrong very early at the 2nd of the packs infront of the first boss....healer webbed....tank suddenly on death's door.....tank through death's door with the door locked behind him.......wipe No 1 !<br />
<br />
Same thing happens again.....wipe No 2.<br />
<br />
and again.....No 3.<br />
<br />
Finally we get to the boss and wipe No 4.  Adds going to healer, healer dying...i'm trying to help heal and res the healer......wipe No 5.<br />
<br />
Oh and in the middle of all of this the plumber turns up to fix the kitchen sink leak!<br />
<br />
Then to cap it all the Lock says 'soz - dinner' :bonk:   So we need another dps....<br />
<br />
Ok a spriest joins us. we go to summon etc etc and....<br />
<br />
Somehow, finally we get the boss down...cue much backslapping and jocularity from all :flipbg: <br />
<br />
If memory serves, we actually downed the 2nd boss without a wipe.....yes amazing i know.....although it could be that by now i'm in denial and cannot rememeber a wipe or 2 :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
so onward.....i think by now we've probably been in here an hour or more !<br />
<br />
down through the hole......run to the top of the big stairs in front of the last boss....mage carries on running and is promptly splattered by the 2 mobs in front of him......much laughing as he admits to forgetting they were there.<br />
<br />
Now at this point we entered the Twilight Zone, or the Laurel and Hardy heroic.....<br />
<br />
The spriest who joined decides he would like to bring his warrior alt for some belt off this boss.....we all say ok we dont mind.  he logouts and we start to say he'll need a summon and start to run back....<br />
<br />
then it suddenly hits us.....how the heck do you get back up through the instance to the entrance after falling through the hole ? You can't, I imagine is the answer that all of your are silently mouthing to yourselves along with other non-repeatable things on a family forum !<br />
<br />
So now we are having to wait for him....mage starts saying lets go and help and he tells us to move back and he pulls the boss and dies.......but how does that help when is at the start alone ?<br />
<br />
By this time the 3 of us are not sure whether to laugh or cry.  much chat in /g with myself and the tank and /w with the healer.  she is getting fed up with this run....spriest winding her up about poor healing. constant mage chatter doing the same.<br />
<br />
so we waste like 15 mins, :sleep:  on this spriest bringing his warrior only to find that it cannot enter the instance !!!!!!  I still dont know why, i did not ask ! So after all this he logs the spriest again and we're good to go...<br />
<br />
To be upfront about it I reckon we wiped 5-7 times on this boss....<br />
<br />
I dont know why but we had major issues with the adds....they went everywhere.....especially to the healer...so dead healer a number of times.....with me ressing once, then trying to do some healing.<br />
<br />
Mage keeps saying he could alter spec to fire as per his raid one but he'll pull everything over the tank.  he died a lot and even before the healer.<br />
<br />
People were not moving quick enough to avoid spikes......incl the healer. I did it as well, although i began to wonder if the range of the spikes had been increased as 2 times in a row i was waiting for the spikes and as soon as it appeared i moved forward and yet both times when I would have sworn i was easily clear i got thrown into the air. it does not help ofc if you are slowed in anyway when the spike is below u......<br />
<br />
Now to properly illustrate how long we had been, there we respawns in the entrance tunnel. I ran back in after a wipe and never saw them not expecting them and died.  Mage did the same....<br />
<br />
finally the mage says got to go to a guild thing.<br />
<br />
so by now we have been here 2 hrs. done 2 bosses and got 2 badges.<br />
<br />
luckily a great rogue i know was on so i begged him to come and help us for 10 mins....1 or 2 tries max on this boss.<br />
<br />
So we killed the respawns and got back to the boss, rebuffed and were set.....<br />
<br />
Cue fanfare of trumpets, cue many scantily clad dancing girls<br />
<br />
<br />
The BOSS is dead !<br />
<br />
It was messy and i used my rebirth again. But we finally got him.  over 2 hrs after starting.<br />
<br />
I'd used 12 GotW reagents. and a similar number of battle and guardian elixirs, plus food.<br />
<br />
Then we come to the recount figures.......I make it a point not to check them during the heroic. I would not look to kick someone for low dps once we had started...so why look.<br />
<br />
My dps was a bit low, although i think perhaps due to some healing i tried at times or just the fact i was getting frustrated as time went on......at only 1900dps, 2.8 million damage total.  The mage missed the last boss fight but did 2000dps and 2.6 million damage.<br />
<br />
The shadow priest........742 dps / 834000 total damage !:newburn: <br />
<br />
The rogue i asked who was with us for the few respawns and the last boss fight.....2100 dps / 655000 damage<br />
<br />
Then to top it all the spriest says anyone for AK or anywhere. I just laughed and said maybe when you can do dps.<br />
<br />
His reply...'wtf dude, i really holy geared'.  i just laughed. when i looked on wow heroes he was shadow specced and full epic....sure a few were more healing bias with MP5 and spirit over crit...but he had good stam and mana plus 1763 spellpower.<br />
<br />
Why come to a heroic as dps and then after being so cr4p say that ?<br />
<br />
Anyways that was my fun last nite....if you're still here reading i thankyou.....you can remove the matchsticks from your eyes now !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">06-10-2009, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wow... what's wrong with your server?<br />
<br />
i don't really pay that much attention to recount (usually just o check and make sure that im at the top slot :P ) but i may have to start checking other pugs' dps. I usually run through a 5 man like VH or DTK or GD for the leather, and 19 times out of 20, im top dps and top damage done. (Cue breaking my arm patting myself on the back) and sometimes I'm as much as 10% above the next person in total damage done. I should pay more attention to their numbers.<br />
<br />
I must say that you have the patience of a saint (or else you're a hardcore masochist) to finish off with that group. I'm one of the LAST people to leave a group once im saved in a heroic, but im sure i wouldn't have lasted that long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">06-10-2009, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just out of curiousity Khel, what kind of server are you on?  (PvP, RP, Normal)<br />
<br />
I am on a RP server which is code for Normal with wierd naming rules.  But our LFG is a good split between qualified intellegent people and .....not so much.<br />
<br />
I guess I haven't PUG'd for Heroics in a long time though...the only time I run them these days is when a guildy needs somthing out of there.  <br />
<br />
I PUG in folks for Ulduar25 everyweek though and I'd say 8/10 are qualified to be there.  I usually do the Wowarmory/Wow-heroes check first though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">06-11-2009, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Talon ! i'll be sure to post more soon and rival Des and her new blog :elfbiggri   (j/k Des, no one could rival your n00by stories :flowers2: )<br />
<br />
hehe cheers skw.....i dont get much wow time and it has to agreed so after we had been there a while it was more a case of lets finish this and get the badges (incl the extra ones as it was the daily!)<br />
<br />
also ofc, you keep thinking its gotta get better ! we cant keep having stupid problems and wipes like this.<br />
<br />
having said that by the time we'd finished and i was then checking recount and getting that priest asking for more heroics i was ready to fly off the handle....<br />
<br />
believe me the healer and my guildie tank were /w me or in /g at times and saying about giving up or finding others instead.  but the mage we had was a nice guy and said he would stick around til we finished although he may have something guilld coming up soon....none of us expected to be in there so long !<br />
<br />
NB : it was v good of him to say this and stay so long. My pet hate and the fastest way to my ignore list is to come along to something and then halfway through say something along the lines of :<br />
<br />
* sorry, i have to go to bed now<br />
* sorry, mum says i have to go eat<br />
* sorry, i have to do my homework<br />
* sorry, the guild want me to go to a heroic<br />
* sorry, i have to go to my guild raid now<br />
<br />
when they dont utter a word at the start that they are on a timelimit. :curse: :curse: :curse: <br />
<br />
oh and skw - i have no idea whats wrong with my server...maybe i should transfer back to the one i left!<br />
<br />
<br />
Solar, i'm on a nornal server. i detest and hate pvp - although ofc there was no pvp in the old days /sigh and i dont think i could cope with RP ! I love my sci-fantasy authors etc but RP a game....not for me.<br />
<br />
We seem to have an over abundance of idiots, trade is full of 12 yr old chat where they use scary 4 letter words they've looked up on the internet. i only go to a city when i really need to....there are still parts of Dalaran i've never seen, and if you put me blindfolded into Silvermoon and then removed it i'd need a month of sundays to find anything incl the way out !<br />
<br />
We try not to pug heroics....i'd basically prefer to go back to RL than to have to pug a heroic. luckily there is usually myself and a guildie and this great healer we know.  then a combination of others who are in much bigger guilds and tend to raid so only come with on off days.<br />
<br />
obviously you do find some good people in pugs....afterall its where most of the people on my friends list are from that we now do heroics with.....but the n00bs outnumber them too much !<br />
<br />
its the fault of the game....no one cares about levelling and learning anymore.  its all get the best loot, go raiding asap so just hit 80 and your're good to go !</div></div><hr />

When I first joined the server (just a month or so after it was created), you could find it here and there, but now 3 years later, it has all but dried up.  I'm sure it still happens in small circles here and there, but it is very, very, very rare that you stumble across it unless you are looking for it.<br />
<br />
The most obvious means to &quot;find&quot; RP is to look for folks walking (not running) in town and/or actually sitting in chairs in bars, parks, etc.</div></div><hr />

Your pet hates parallel my own.  <br />

Or, after the first wipe or two you get this from a healer:  &quot;Oh...LOLZ!  I've been in the wrong spec this ENTIRE time!  No wonder I couldn't cast &lt;insert healing spell here&gt; LOLOL!&quot;<br />

Oh hardee har har...*insta-boots the noob*<br />

It was a pretty entertaining story though- I was giggling a bit- and also had a tear in my eye because that's just a tragic, tragic mess.  I'm tellin ya...we should join a server together.  We'd own.  Period. =D</div></div><hr />

i'm surprised tlb - i thought the RP servers were all populated by the RP fraternity and you would be viewed with disdain if you did not adher to RP principles.<br />

<br />
yeah it was one of them runs wherre at times do you laugh or cry....esp the bit where he wants to bring his warrior for some belt....and then top it all it never dropped in the end anyways !<br />
<br />
Indeed Des, i think they should create a server in our honour ! and we get to police it :dance:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried to survive runs like that... after the 3rd wipe before the first boss, I would have graciously bowed out and tried my luck with another group perhaps.  You're a tougher druid than I, love. <br />
<br />
In a way, runs like that (which yes, I'm STILL finding myself trapped in) make me resent Dual Spec.  Take me, for example.  I have a good healing set...decent spec and my healing glyphs.  The skill of healing, however, I lack for the most part.  It seems that dual spec has cursed us in this way- being stuck with folks that have the gear and the spec...but that just lack the skill to play the role they insist they can play.  Oi...</div></div><hr />

But they were easy to avoid.  In fact, most of the RP actually occurred in the WoW server forum (though I haven't checked that forum in years).  That's where the RP thugs would come down hard on you for OOC (out-of-character) talk.<br />
<br />
Even when RP was more common, most of the public chat channels were a mix of RP and non-RP talk (ex. &quot;Battle ready warrior looking for a chance to take on the denizens of Ulduar.&quot;  --&gt; &quot;tank LFG&quot;).  And party/raid chat it was assumed to be OOC due to the technical nature of the conversation.  Guild chat varied by guild.  Some wanted in character, others tolerated OOC.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen RP in a public chat channel in 2+ years.<br />
<br />
There use to be an addon (might still exists) that many used for RP as well.  It provided others with your bio/history/etc when they clicked on your toon (if they had the addon as well).  From what I recall, you could easily identify those with and without the addon if you had the addon installed.  So, you could avoid non-RPrs easily.</div></div><hr />

While leveling as a young druid...I used to run around with my hunter friend.  He was (and still is) VERY heavy into RP.  Used to drive me absolutely batty (we're on a normal server).  <br />
<br />
He'd want to RP while the mobs were tearing my face off.  &quot;Avast demon!  Hurt not my young druid friend!&quot;  Etc etc...and I'd usually say something along the lines of, &quot;Kill it or I kill YOU.&quot;  And this is where my love of sacrificing the hunter began...He'd get chin deep into some RP about how my druid and his hunter were meant to be...so I'd ask him to help me farm purple lotus in Azshara.  The elites would destroy him, I'd prowl around and pick the flowers...he'd get angry and log out.  Then I'd return to questing.  Nice?  No.  Effective...yes.</div></div><hr />

beginning to wish i was on a RP server tlb !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">06-15-2009, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">beginning to wish i was on a RP server tlb !I was on a PvP server and I hated it.  Too much time wasted corpse walking while leveling.  It was damn annoying.  Once Blizzard opened up realm-to-realm transfers, I started doing some R&amp;D.  From what little information I could find, the &quot;RP&quot; server type seemed to fit my needs.  Less kids, more mature, no PvP.<br />
<br />
My only real compliant is there seems to be a high number of &quot;social&quot; players.  You learn to identify them quickly though.<br />
<br />
They just play to have fun, not necessarily to become a more skilled player or to improved their toon.  These are the types that 4+ alts at the level cap and are working on a 5th, have world explorer on 3 of the 4, 50 pets on 2 of the 4, max'd fishing and cooking, etc.  Yet their DPS is sub-par and their gear only &quot;looks good&quot;, but doesn't have the stats they need for their class/spec.  They are also the players that never want to run a 5-man, but yet they complain if they don't get a spot on a Naxx run (they want to &quot;see the new content&quot;).  If they do go on a 5-man or Naxx run they never roll on gear they desperately need, because they have no clue that they need it.<br />
<br />
My first guild had quite a few of them, but my newer guild seems to have fewer of them.<br />
<br />
I do wish I had not picked a low-pop (now medium) server when I Xfer'd.  The alliance side was huge when I Xfer'd, but the horde side was quite thin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i want guilds to progress so i can see some nice BOE's on the AH and there are not enough Horde guilds making any sort of proper Uldaur progression :(<br />
<br />
we appear to have 1/2 Horde guild that has really done any 25 man Uldaur. i am hoping its just a bit of a summer blip as i know one of these guilds has suffered from a lack of healers recently due to RL/ holidays.</div></div><hr />

I think we have 2-4 guilds that are actively progressing in Ulduar 25.<br />
<br />
In the early years, my server was stupid lopsided toward alliance (I think Alliance toons lend themselves to more traditional RP roles???).  It had to be 4-1 if not worst.  I think now it is the normal 60/40 split you see on most severs.<br />

Is there a good site to track a server's &quot;progression&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
www.warcrafter.net is a pretty good site for something like that. It tracks (and ranks) guilds by progression and average ilvl gear. From there, you can get a picture of how your server is progressing compared to other servers by browsing around.<br />
<br />
one thing to note: if characters haven't been updated from the armory lately, it can make a huge difference in guild rankings and so on... for instance, when i first checked it out, my guild was ranked number 3 on the server. as i checked out other guilds and their characters, my guild fell further and further until we were 16th or so on the server, so it may take some time and a LOT of clicking on characters to get an accurate depiction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the other 2 (raiders with some ilvl 219 and even 226 gear) did 2.5 and 2.6k dps.<br />
<br />
stuff died so damn quickly !<br />
<br />
plus we often use one of the OP DK's to tank.  he does not far off 2k dps which to me just seems way OP for a tank ?  (do the other tanking classes manage 1800 dps+ ?)</div></div><hr />

On a single target in 25man i do around 2k-2.4k dps.<br />
On trash it can go up to 2.8k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am usually up around 2k for overall DPS when a run is done aswell.  I know a lot of that is AoE stuff, but I also have several fights where my DPS is nerfed for pretty badly due to stam sets or boss gimic's.  (Ulduar content, haven't done naxx since 3.1 came out...tanking anyways.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
even back then he was way OP compared to the dps - given he is tanking.<br />
<br />
s3R / Solar - are you talking dps figures when you tank with a DK ?<br />
<br />
The figures I quote are for a DK in tank gear/talents etc tanking a 5 man.<br />
<br />
I can understand if you quote figures for Uldaur level tanks, as the dps on the dps from similar geared players will be way above my 2k-2.2k !<br />
<br />
DK's just seem ridiculously OP for their gear and I hope they get a serious dps nerf when set up as a tank.  I do not know his exact talent build.<br />
<br />
He's called Haibane on Bronze Dragonflight EU if anyone has a few spare minutes or is interested in a quick look.  I know he gets a lot of damage from AOE - Howling Blast he says is amazing (even OP!).  And he's so easy to dps with.....at my gear level i basically dont need to wait more than a second after his pull to open up with Hurricane.<br />
<br />
But i still feel that as a class he should not finish a 5 man 1st or 2nd on the DPS charts ??? Should he ? He is there to take damage, not to out dps good dps.<br />
<br />
Maybe i need to go back to feral tanking and see how my gear does for dps etc in a heroic with the changes that have taken place over the past few months.<br />
<br />
Or I need to see him come to a heroic with us as a dps - he talks of 2.7k when he does dps in a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, no nice way to say, but that is a case of player fail, not the class.<br />
<br />
A DK in i200+ gear could maintain 1k DPS just auto attacking.  I find most DK's have no idea about half of their abilities.  They are definatley a complicated class to get the hang of, but have some exceptional abilities, particularily when they are accompanied by a compitent rotation.</div></div><hr />

I've seen a few DK tanks absolutely ROCK regarding threat and dps, but since it's still a new class, i automatically assume that the player isn't going to be able to hold threat when i start pulling the pin on dps, whether on a 5 man instance, or a 10 or 25 man raid.<br />
<br />
I'm also skeptical of a DK's ability to take the big hits when they've used their CD's up. From what i understand, they're just as squishy as a Fury warrior when they're waiting for their CD's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-01-2009, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skwid, It seems to depend on their gear as to how well they take these big hits after CD's are blown.  I've had the privilege of healing on a few different DK tanks over the past little while.  It's hard to keep some of them up after CD's.  We have a &quot;graduate&quot; from our guild that still, after CD's is ezmode to heal.  LOVE running with him.  He's a hardcore raider, so it's a rare occasion that we get together.  But always a pleasure to heal for him.  (He makes me look good as a healer, which is REALLY hard to do hehe)<br />
<br />
Think it depends a lot on their avoidance...Dodge and parry and all that.  Some have a ludicrous amount of avoidance, which makes them amazing to heal for.  Others...eh...not so much...so once they blow their CD's you're frantically searching for ways to keep the plated squishy from dyin'.</div></div><hr />

A DK not using his CDs takes almost the same damage a Druid does. But the DK has more avoidance than a Druid. (same level of gear).<br />
The &quot;big hits&quot; as u call it, hurt a DK not more than any other tank. A DK has even more low-CD abilities to reduce those big hits than any other tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-02-2009, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what CD abilities are we talking about ?<br />
<br />
my guildie usually brings his DK - he tanks if this other OP DK is not about or does DPS if the other guild DK is around.<br />
<br />
now i'm not the most competent of healer nor do i heal that often but i find it soooo much easier to heal the non guildie OP DK.<br />
<br />
Last night we ran 4 heroics and my guildie did all the tanking. I healed only one of them but he seemed to be taking much bigger hits...spike damage....than the other one.<br />
<br />
I dont know the specifics to their talent differences.  Gear is on a par tbh.<br />
<br />
I also have to be a bit more careful of pulling early aggro with my guildie DK than the other one when opening up with hurricane.  I never pull mobs from the OP DK.<br />
<br />
I'm told the OP one uses a lot of marcos - so does that make such a big difference to the amount of dps etc he can put out ?  ie does it make his rotation that much more efficient than someone doing it manually ?<br />
<br />
Sadly I basically never run with any tank but these 2 DK's so cant comment on other tanking classes now.<br />
<br />
Oh and yes in one of the 4 heroics last nite we had another numpty dps !<br />
<br />
The last one we did.... VH !!  I had to go afk a bit to sort food and the oven so left them to find a 5th as we lost a good spriest.<br />
<br />
Came back to find we had an unguilded kitty druid. no time to really inspect him as they had been waiting for me and it was getting late.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say we did rock....we got the VW :o  but we managed to blitz him...not had him in like 10 VH runs.  The last dragon boss always seems a bit of a non even in VH, esp if you've had one of the harder bosses like VW or Xevozz (??).<br />
<br />
But she actually dropped the War Mace ! Never seen it....pity our healer thought it was a bit better than what she was using so I passed for her. It would have been a nice upgrade for my resto set.<br />
<br />
So after we kicked butt i look at my recount to find the druid had done 934 dps !! a little over 500k damage iirc.  The mage and myself had done 2.5k ish and 2.6k ish...with the mage beating me in damage done by 0.3%. Tank i think was on circa 1450 dps.<br />
<br />
Funny thing was when i saw the kitty he had 23k HP so i guess i sorta assumed reasonable gear.  But when i got time to look at him at the end i noticed a polar item or 2 plus a green or 2.  Is it me or is someone wearing polar items a numpty n00b for 5 man heroics ? esp if they are not a low hp tank ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">07-02-2009, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if a kitty is wearing Polar anything, then he is either a really dumb cat, or maybe he forgot to click his outfitter... I myself am guilty of that about 30% of the time i start a heroic. I'll have my PvP set on, and then notice im not at the top of the damage meter after the 4th or so pull, then promptly kick myself, equip the kitty set, and pull the pin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was he spec'd as a kitty or a bear?  To me, it sort of sounds like a noobish bear that tried to pass himself off as DPS to get his lil paws on the Staff of Trickery (which isn't a bad tanking weapon to start off with)<br />
<br />
In bear form, that 23k HP would translate to something a bit bigger...Us poor bears.  We can't pass ourselves off as kitty dps no matter how hard we try =D<br />
<br />
I wouldn't necessarily say that wearing any of the polar items for 5-man heroics is a noobish thing...for a bear tank.  I still don my Polar pieces for some heroics where there's lots of magic damage- just to have a little buff against it.   In fact, it was my starter tanking set for heroics.  But to try and pass yourself off as a bear dressed up as a kitten...that's making me want to giggle...</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah i think he was just a n00b full stop Des and yeah he wants the Trickery....he was using a Titansteel Destroyer.<br />
<br />
i know my kitty dps was much better than that when i was bear specced a few months ago.</div></div><hr />

It &quot;sounds&quot; like he wants to be a bear.  That being the case, he shouldn't try and pass himself off as Kitty DPS.  If he wants to be a kitty, then he should respec as such.  Just sounds to me like he has an identity crisis going on right now lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think he does need to decide on 1 role and spec for it now though.<br />
<br />
not that we are going to invite him again !<br />
<br />
it was bad enough last night....our epic tank had laptop over heating issues and d/c for 20 mins in HOL, then came back for about 10 mins and then d/c again ! luckily we got it done with a guildie switching to his tank and another guildie coming to dps.<br />
<br />
it got worse for the 2nd heroic when the great dps rogue had to leave, the priest (now a new guildie) wanted to bring his newly 80 hunter (/shudder) leaving me to heal !<br />
<br />
unfortunately the time was moving on and the 5th person who actually said yes that i asked was another hunter (but someone i knew)<br />
<br />
we only went to UK for a fast run :o  stuff took so long so die !<br />
<br />
i dont know what it is with hunters - but regardless of gear they cant dps their way out of a paper bag !<br />
<br />
put it this way at the end of the run the tank was No 1 on damage and 2nd on dps.  both hunters just did 1k dps and the mage did just more dps than the tank but less overall damage.</div></div><hr />

It's strange that you say that about hunters though.  My former GM's main is a hunter with incredible dps.  Sickeningly good dps.  We also have another hunter who can rock the meters.  I've PuG'd with a few low dps hunters.  Maybe it depends on spec?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main used to be a Hunter and while it's an easy class to play to a mediocre level I would say that a combination of Spec, knowing how the class mechanics [dont] work and buffs play a big part in maximising Hunter DPS.<br />
<br />
You can still do reasonably well on the meters (if that's your thing) by faceplanting the keyboard with a BM spec let alone MM or Surv, both of which just require a different combination of &quot;button mashing&quot; to BM regardless of whether Blizzard reckons you need more &quot;skill&quot; to get the most out of them compared to BM.<br />
<br />
Hunters do seem to attract the casual, to a point that they wouldn't know a talent point if it mugged them, player to a much greater degree than other classes, although it's certainly not exclusive. It is good fun taking the hunter out of mothballs and into a raid if nothing else to be able to say &quot;dude, this is my alt, I haven't played it for months, it's got a grinding BM talent spec, I'm using a Spirit Beast, didn't notice for 2 bunches of mobs that blizzard STILL haven't fixed the pet bars so went in with no pet attacks active and I'm still blowing you out the water on DPS in equivalent gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
That there's a lot more flexibility now in terms of talents does seem to have confused a lot of the pretenders who cant just go to Wow-wiki, look up the cookie-cutter 41/20 BM spec, use  a macro to work round the broken mechanics and do top notch DPS.<br />
<br />
and us druid are skilled <br />
I maybe a tree, but part of my heart will always be a BM hunter, dont think there's much co-incidence in my character choices, but I still maintain that blowing the snot out of everyone on the damage meters as a hunter requires a lot more skill than people give credit for, certainly post TBC where anyone capable of using Google could rule the damage meters if they wanted to.</div></div><hr />

@Nellie: I've seen more mediocre hunters than I can even count.  My GM, though, is one of those folks that honestly puts her ALL into mastering and researching her classes, specs, gear, and everything in between.  She definitely does her homework, and her DPS shows this.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind having hunters with my groups.  I just don't put up with huntard antics- like a pet on aggressive, a pet that's taunting constantly, they Misdirect a mob onto a healer or DPS.  <br />
<br />
A friend of mine went into Naxx with a hunter that kept MDing shots onto the healers.  I would have torn his face off.  There's a 0% chance I would have kept him in group after the first warning.  And I guess he ended up being a ninja after all was said and done too.  /shrug I'm glad I wasn't in that group.  Healers control who lives and who dies.  &quot;Cute&quot; dps is expendable and easily replaced.  (And it's a LOT of fun to let those types of folks rack up a hefty repair bill...:ange:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh my it was not easy !<br />
<br />
with a great grp we had just run 2 heroics back to back in 60 mins...UK and Drak....my GotW has 2 mins left on it as we started the fight with Tharon'Ja.<br />
<br />
With a grp change we had me for dps, usual guild tank and a good healer I know.<br />
<br />
we usually blitz Gun as easily as we do anything else.....but with 2 poor dps we had a fair few wipes, esp that first boss where the adds kept getting through to myself and the healer who were standing on the other side of the doorway into the room where the boss is.<br />
<br />
the statue/ele boss also caused us a few problems with healer aggro on changover leading to dead dps.<br />
<br />
Galdarah to impaling the healer twice casued wipes as people went down so fast before i could get much in the way of heals off, let alone res the healer.<br />
<br />
Finally we killed Galdarah and i had one of them classic, its-great-to-be-a-druid-fight.<br />
<br />
Start of dpsing for all i'm worth.....impaled healer...switch to healing to keep tank alive.....healer dies....still healing keeping tank and dps alive.....throw healer a battle res......innervate her.....back to oomkin......boss dead :)<br />
<br />
over 90 mins in there !  kitty druids does 830 dps, dps warrior about 1.2k. i think i managed about 2.1k.<br />
<br />
40g repairs. used a lot of pots and food and reagents.<br />
<br />
But we still had fun tbh....no one got upset or threw toys out of pram. we all know each other....it was 4 guildies and a priest i know well.<br />
<br />
so for situations like that i could do with better gear from the upcoming badge changes to help 'carry' some dps :p</div></div><hr />

i must say i do not tend to change if i spot someone low on HP - i figure it aint my job in a 5 man and usually by the time i really notice i believe i would not save them time i switch out and start throwing non-ToL heals their way ?<br />

is this wrong ?  shouud i be more awake :p and look to switch out of oomkin to help the healer ?<br />

hehe thanks Des .....i'd had to do that a couple times recently as we  take more low dps to heroics. it makes such a difference to a grp if not everyone is on a par dps wise.<br />

yes Des, this made me post the warrior thread as one of the 2 guildies who needs gearing is a warrior. (also has 80 priest whcih he is bored of and a 80 hunter that does low dps and needs some gear to).</div></div><hr />

I see it less since DKs were introduced but it's still common. I ran eric OS on the hunter a week or so ago, hadn't realised they stopped Steady Shot from being macroed, shows how long it's been since I played it, and still out DPS'ed three other hunters in there on similar gear as a BM hunter with a Spirit beast pet (ie less than optimal DPS spec).<br />
<br />
Once I deleted the macro and reverted back to a manual weave on another run it was business as usual :D<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure why Blizzard seem to think that juggling 7 different abilities' CDs is fun, it's nice to see what is going on during the fight rather than playing whack-a-mole on the hunter as well as the druid but hey ho.<br />
<br />
Busy in guild at the moment, got two new Resto druids and a boomkin/tank that are all still learning the raid ropes. While I'm not claiming to be an expert, I knocked up a resto healing 101 which seems to have gone down well with our guys, even the kitty/resto guy who knows his stuff reckons it's helped his healing. I'll have to switch kitty for an hour or so to get that warm Fuzzy feeling :D</div></div><hr />

I adore him and don't mind running myself ragged trying to figure out how to put a guild together/keep it together- etc etc.</div></div><hr />

They're intensely OP.  Mine can solo most group quests and she's not amazingly geared or talented well.  Plus I have no idea what I'm doing.  I just hit whatever isn't on cooldown...haven't bothered to research the class much.  I suppose I could...but there are just SO many of them right now...we have guilds and raid groups on server flat out refusing to accept DK's.  It's a little funny.</div></div><hr />
