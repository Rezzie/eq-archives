<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaorin</div><div class="date">08-15-2003, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have been camping for Gynok for some time now.  I know that the spawn (whether it is gynok or a placeholder) is right at the zone and the mob will walk from there to the locked door on the left and back again.  At least that is what I have been told.  Anyway here is my question. How do I get that placeholder/gynok to start to spawn.  I have yet to see anything spawn right at the zone line and start walking.  Is there a trick to get it to start spawning.  Does the placeholder/gynok despawn after a while or something if no one kills it or does it walk off somewhere and just stand there after a while.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I found was that if he spawned in rat form, he'd go down the first hallway behind the locked door and get stuck there.  Look to see if there's a rat stuck in a doorway behind the first door (in that hall there) and kill it.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, just kill everything on level 3 and hope for the best :) <br />
<br />
If you see any mob shouting about his sleep being disturbed, that's the mob, so kill it.<br />
<br />
Usually the rat thing worked for me though.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad that I can remember this after nearly 4 years... but I can't remember what I did yesterday at work... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish you better luck than I had.  I got &quot;lucky&quot; when I camped him the first time, he popped in about 40 minutes... and dropped the copper ring =(<br />
<br />
Next time, he never popped after about 40 PHs, and I gave up.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaorin</div><div class="date">08-17-2003, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip.  I did find him stuck in a wall down at the door to the third floor that takes the smoked glass key.  I sat down to see if the skeleton there said the little sleep bit and out of the wall came a plague rat.  Well I finished em both quickly and went back up sat down and 17 minutes later pops a ghoul.  Thanks<br />
<br />
You know though the sad thing is I had petitioned. A GM came along and said that all the mobs were fine and she couldn't find any stuck in the geometry.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
Well now back to camping him.  Heres hoping he pops now<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the time you level to 45 you won't be using that thing anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For someone that expects to get hit on occasion, it's a pretty good primary item.  It has some AC, agi, and sta, in addition to the 9 wis.  I used one until I got my epic.</div></div><hr />

Me too, levels 42-60.  It's on an alt now, but still has Tat's fingerprints burned into it =)<br />

<br />
Level 30 until the late 50's or early 60's is a pretty long lifespan for an item...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course hers was cursed with the blood of the numerous Mitty's she had to kill to get it... I'll never give up that Paw.  Too much of my life invested in it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kobara</div><div class="date">08-26-2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the Paw was once an uber item to hold onto until well past the level you needed to quest it, but with the added expansions and added items available within those expansions for a druid, I think the one feeling the quest is a waste for the reward probably was thinking about all the other stuff out there now... those of us who used it up as high as those speaking its praises are those of us who started our druids before Kunark was even a rumor on the horizon... I got mine back in Oct 1999 and at that time, there were precious few quests for gear that a human Tunare druid could accomplish.<br />
<br />
Agree, today, it isnt worth the time you invest unless you enjoy the questing part of everQUEST. So, whether you use it til 60, or throw it in the bank or on an alt trader mule, by all means press on and be proud of the accomplishment once the final turn in is done.... also, this may be the only time you enter Kerra Ridge zone, so relish it while you can <br />
<br />
Sidebar: They should REALLY do something about Kerra Ridge... nice zone but soooo under-utilized with such great potential for more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OldManWillow</div><div class="date">10-02-2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I used to do this camp for people in my old, old, OLD guild. Gynok or his placeholders always spawn on teh bone at the zone line to West Commonlands. If you see any mob that is walking and has not been trained then that is a placeholder. Gynok ALWAYS spawns at least once ever 17 hours, I know this from over 27 camps of this mob, and at least 6 of those camps I was there for the full 17 hours. Each place holder spawns every 16 minutes (after the previous one is killed), will walk down to the third floor and back to zone line, stop for a minute then walk back to third floor, back up to zone line and de-spawn. the double walk takes about 26 minutes, so if you want a faster turn over in placeholders kill them.<br />
<br />
Gynok can drop either the copper, gold or platinum ring. He can drop more than one ring at a time as well, but this is rare. The only good thing is that the plat is his common drop.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

I was thinkin' about getting my epic for the clickie dot but Blade of the Tempest has about the same effect.  <br />
<br />
Gonna save my points for that and use the time I would've spent on epic to get aa's. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I get to wait until Blade of the Tempest (Mith Marr drop) or maybe I'll get lucky and another Dark Mace of Thought / Staff of Lost Rituals will drop for me.</div></div><hr />

I play on FV and had to do the entire quest when it was level appropriate to do so. (TLC don't ya know)  When done during level appropriate times you get decent experience and its a lot of fun to do. Now if your 50 something and looking to go back and solo it aye I would agree its prolly a waste of time. But for those who are on their first character its an excellent quest with an excellent reward. Again provided its done at a level appropriate time.<br />
<br />
I still managed to solo it although the mushroom in guk was a bit of a challenge.<br />

At that level it was really a pain but if you are still getting exp then not a total waste...   I must admit though.. too many skeletons, mittys and shrooms died for that paw..</div></div><hr />
