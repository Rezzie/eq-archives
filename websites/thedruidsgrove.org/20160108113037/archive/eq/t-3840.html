<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perk Ynipples</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally got Hand of Ro last night, and now have all the PoP debuffs with the exception of Eci's Frosty Breath. I decided to go find some nice green mobs and try some stacking tests. The results are interesting to say the least.<br />
<br />
First, Ro's Illumination stacks with RFS, and Fixation, but is overwritten by RSD. Second, Hand of Ro will not stack with anything but Ro's Illumination. Third, Fury of Ro and Breath of Ro do not stack. Finally you can still use RFS to allow various different stacks like you used to.<br />
<br />
With that said, follow this link www.clanimpact.org/files/stacking.htm<br />
<br />
I've identified three different stack types, though there are different variations (use breath instead of fury, or add in immolate etc).<br />
<br />
The first stack, maximises ATK debuffage, and is most usefull for high damage mobs. This stack is RFS, Fixation, Illumination, Hand, Fury. As usual Fury can be cast anytime, but the others need to be cast in order. This stack debuffs the mob's ATK by 242 at level 65.<br />
<br />
The second stack type, is very similar to the old stack, but adds in Ro's Illumination since it stacks with the old debuffs. This stack maximises AC debuffage, and is most usefull on annoying high AC mobs (stuff in Ssra etc). The cast order is RFS, Fixation, Illumination, RSD, Fury. Fury as always can be cast anytime. This stack debuffs the mob's AC by 67, but only drops ATK by 204 at level 65.<br />
<br />
The third stack type is what I call the quick and dirty stack. Very usefull when xping, when there are only one or two druids on the raid, or when you just wanna get the stack done fast so you can n00k =) Basically, its just Hand of Ro and Ro's Illumination. Add in Fury if you feel like it, and you get a nice rounded debuff of 37AC, 180ATK, and 107FR.<br />
<br />
There are other things to take into account as well like the mobs FR (if its high FR, you may have to use Hand of Ro at the start and go with the last stack anyway as Fixation and Illumination may not land even after RFS etc) but these are the basics of debuff stacking with the new spells. If anyone wants to donate a copy of Eci's Frosty Breath on the Innoruuk server, I'll test that out as well =P<br />

<br />
Yeah, they both have a -200 resist adjust according to Lucy: lucy.fnord.net/spell.html...ource=Live (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3435&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
In practice, Hand lands just as well as RFS did.  Stuck it on Tunare without a problem last night (though nothing else would land even with it in heh)</div></div><hr />

&gt; Hand with hand overwriting Sundering. Just like the ol'<br />
&gt; stacking things with disjunction trick.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's what I do with the first stack, but you can toss Ro's Illumination as well as Fixation in the middle.  Hand of Ro overwrites RFS, but leaves Fixation and Illumination on the mob, just like RSD does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casting in order:<br />
<br />
Ros firey sundry first &lt;em&gt; Lowers Fr to make things easier &lt;/em&gt; <br />
Fixation of ro's.<br />
Hand of ro's &lt;em&gt; This overwrites ros firey sundry &lt;/em&gt;<br />
Ro's illumination.<br />
<br />
Net result = <br />
Fixation of ro's, hand of ro's, ro's illumination.<br />
<br />
ac 18 (L60)<br />
atk 60 (L60)<br />
<br />
FR 72 (L61)<br />
AC 48 (L61)<br />
Atk 100 (L61)<br />
<br />
AC 15 (L62)<br />
Atk 80 ( L62 ) <br />
<br />
= AC 81, ATK 240, FR 72.<br />
<br />
Now I assume you can also get fury of ro's on there but none of us had it. ( didnt count breath of ro above btw ) <br />
<br />
So that would be <br />
1: Decrease Armor Class (AC) by 27 <br />
2: DoT for 1400 Hit Points (HP) in 10 ticks<br />
3: Decrease Fire Resist by 35 (L62)<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Total = AC 108, ATK 240, FR 107&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Thats all I tested so far, I assume the cold debuff one stacks with these which is a bit more ac and CR also but I dont have that one yet either :) <br />
<br />
Feal free to correct me if I wrong or maths are wrong.  Was a bit drunk when doing test so cant remember everything clearly ;) <br />
*cough*<br />
<br />
What I did notice was once you add disjunction to the equation it all goes pete tong and you cant land half the stuff u should be able to.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />
