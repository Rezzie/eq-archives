I am so glad that this site isn't blocked. I mean, I know I am working, and I shouldn't be looking at game info. But still, I am about ready to buy a freaking domain, and then just literally copy the entire allah's profile d-base so that I can check people's profiles at work. I like looking at that stuff and it drives me crazy not being able to. People mention spells/talents/equipment etc, and since I am new to the game, I don't have it all memorized yet so I have no idea what they are talking about. Once I get home, I'd rather just play.<br />

If anyone knows any other WoW sites that Websense hasn't filtered yet, please let me know.<br />

If you really want to, you can create a ssh tunnel to your home machine, and use it to browse the web. Its quite a bit more work, but possible :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you really wanna check out an item/talent/spell/whatever, but thott and alla are blocked, just google it and look at the cached version of the page that google has available.  you can get general info that way, and hopefully also learn from the comments how to obtain it.  i typically google &quot;whatever i am looking for&quot; and &quot;thott&quot; at the end of the search query; works like a charm.</div></div><hr />

Obviously this forum is not.  :cool: I would just luv it if I could browse quests on Alla's or Thott.  I guess ssh or remote term access to my home pc may be an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The remote access idea is good in theory, but it practice I would feel bad. I mean, its one thing to randomly try and look up game information by going to sites that haven't been filtered yet, but something completely different to activly try to defeat the protection. Maybe if I didn't like the place/people I work for, but it would feel like doing something I consider wrong, instead of just doing something the company and I don't agree on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Expensive software???? Depending on your router, it might have a ssh server on it. If not, some versions of Windows and almost all versions of Linux both have ssh servers installed by default, you just have to know how to configure it. And Putty is a free ssh client.<br />
<br />
So server = free, client = free. It's not expensive at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, afaik its 100% free, just well, not exactly ethical for me to use it just to get around the filtering. I mean, I actually had one set up, when I was in college, I had putty on my USB drive, and if ever I forgot some homework or whatever I could open it and print it from school.<br />
<br />
Maybe I could say I set it up to retrieve the documents I was working on at home (which don't exsist at this point) and a byproduct is that I could search the web. Maybe my concience would fell better then. :behindcom <br />

Yea....I do the accounting but they also call me up when they have computer problems....easy ones too.<br />

Guess I won't have to worry about getting sites blocked here.  Yay!  I'm so glad because I get bored at work when it's not tax time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was in college at a Christian college most of the web was blocked (for obvious reasons such as porn).<br />
<br />
Many times gamer type sites would be blocked as well for 'violence'.  I could access alot of it by searching for the term on google and clicking the 'cached' under the listing next to the destination page.<br />
<br />
This worked since google.com was not blocked and the cached page is stored on their server.</div></div><hr />
