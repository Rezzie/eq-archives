It has been nearly 6 months since I wrote the sticked post in this forum about Attack Reduction.  The result of that work became a 4+ pages of discussion across 3 or 4 differant forums.  <br />
<br />
Now, My night playtime has dropped a fair amount due to my recently aquiring a 3rd shift job.  This leaves most of my playtime in the morning (when very few people are awake).  So I am going to expand on my parsing a bit for completness sake over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
What I am asking you, fellow Forum readers, is for a list of points from this thread (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13107) in which you feel should be expanded upon, or added.  I was considering also trying to factor in what we know about AC debuffs (from my other sticked thread) Into a proper printable guide about our Ro line of spells.  I would like to address and clairfy any points which are not clear.<br />
<br />
I am also accepting parses of Before / After Debuffs for new parse results.  I ideally hope to redo all the existing graphs in Excel so they are clearer and the entire thing looks more professionally done.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time!<br />
