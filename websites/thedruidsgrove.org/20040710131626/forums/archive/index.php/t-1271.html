<br />
In fact the only 53+ OUTDOOR zone that I can think of right now is UP and it is so full of casters that picking your mobs, then rounding your quad, and not geting any casters after all that would be almost imposible.<br />
<br />
(would be fun tryin heheh)<br />
<br />
A Quaders most EXP benifitial (and FUN!!!) way of leveling is through quading and with PoP making us 65 all our current spots will be greenies.<br />
<br />
What are some spots that would still be good at 65?</div></div><hr />

Looking at this writeup, I would say soloing is going to be tough post 60.  The experience system is changed see the &quot;Other Items&quot; section of the above link.</div></div><hr />

I was planing on waiting to get PoP just because I'm tight on cash this month. Now after reading that I want to go break down Wal-Mart's doors to get my copy just to see and explore hehe. Ah well, Maybe I can borrow cash from someone ;)</div></div><hr />
