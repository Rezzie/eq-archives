<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mattgoth1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi,<br />
Think a 59 Druid and a 65 Mage could duo this guy? We tried him before but only got him to 20% before i went oom and pet died, this was using the pet cleric stratergy (heh all down to his dispells) :( <br />
If so what stratergy would you guys suggest I use, Mage and Me play pet cleric or let me heal while the mage nukes Fay to death.<br />
Thnx for any help</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did him couple days ago with 65 war, 65 dru, 65 sham. Unslowed. Was very trivial. most of our buffs got wiped, but we just kept warrior healed. <br />
<br />
triggered Fay is LB to 65, so lvl 50 right? <br />
<br />
Sounds like you could add either another healer, or another mage, maybe another pet class. Adding melee would not help since pet wouldnt hold agro. GL to you. Sounds like your very close.<br />
