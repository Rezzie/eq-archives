<br />
My account ended at the beginning of December, and even then #'s were very low.  Many Ikkinz raids with 25 people or less. and Time with 30ish.<br />
<br />
Also noticed that the bazaar was slowly dying, and i was told when i was still playing that our server didn't get nearly as effected by WoW etc. as other servers.<br />
<br />
Looking back at the guild websites, i noticed 3 out of our top 5 guilds on the server have died.  Rest in Peace, the guild i was in, is still there, alot of member play WoW, but they seemed to have survived, roster aint to big though.<br />
<br />
First i was a WoW sceptic, because it was killing EQ atm, but if you cant beat em, join em  :crazy: <br />
<br />
I noticed alot of people said that they still play EQ, was wondering how the things are going.</div></div><hr />

Lot of the top guilds are folding/merging. Bazaar is empty, PoK is empty (thank God). My guild is hurting, still able to progress but we need more numbers if we want to push through Time.</div></div><hr />

Once you start merging, it goes public and downhill from there. SOE's all about giving everybody a faulse appeal of their product.</div></div><hr />

We are aware that with the recent release of new MMO's that some of our fans have moved on and we wish them the best of luck. We have noted that this has had an impact on some server populations, most noticeably our PVP servers. The PvP community has asked that we further explore the idea of server mergers and to that end, we’ve put a poll for PvP players asking if servers were to be merged, which rule set they would most like to play under. More details for you on that soon. Although we are satisfied with the current population of most other servers, we will take a look at each after the release of EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath and identify whether any additional mergers will be needed.<br />

may be sooner than you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keeping PvP servers populated makes sense. And PvP has never been a big seller for EQ (always tons of balance issues with it). I wouldn't suprised at all if they phased it out totally (or kept it to a single server).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glyss</div><div class="date">02-03-2005, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pvp servers are being merged. I was on Tallon Zek before I came to WoW and the server had taken a huge hit. All guilds except my old one had fallen including all our rivals as most of their members quit. Basically all it was when I left was Qvic geared people raping everyone in range to 70. There were no more reilable high end guilds on the server except one. All the good players remaining immediately made amends with them (rivals or not) and tried to bottleneck into Pandemonium... the last remaining upper guild. I hear that everyone looks forward to the server merge as it will bring new drama, excitement, and of course pvp to the server. I honestly don't see EQ surviving another expansion tho and it might as well be circling the drain. Tallon Zek was a magnet for drama tho, i'd love to reactivate my account to just to watch all the new guilds fight, people whine, **** talk, and corpses get camped all over again. Oh the memories.<br />

The new Expansions for each EverQuest game look great, but it is in fact dying... in my opinion, it died after Luclin.</div></div><hr />
