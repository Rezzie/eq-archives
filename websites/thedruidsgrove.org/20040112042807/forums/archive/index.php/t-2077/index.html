<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alyn Cross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i want to hear of some group or groups having killed EVERY mob in a zone.  i'm not talking nothing in your druid track radius, i'm talking a ranger zones in and only sees PC's....<br />
<br />
anyone done it?<br />
<br />
i, myself had aspirations to do so in droga before the revamp, back when factioning for my ring that i no longer wear... but that's another story.<br />
<br />
some fun possiblities:  <br />
<br />
Sol B - i think 3 groups... one to do kobolds, one to do giants/ldc's and one to do imps/ldc's...<br />
<br />
Rivervale! - full blown raid... have your assassins kill off the guards and fight in and around in a massive melee... get revenge for that damnable music!<br />
<br />
Highkeep - leave nobody alive!  dunno how many groups, mebbie only one.  <br />
<br />
Nektulos forest - split up good and evil and kill off the halflings and inkies in 2 groups.<br />
<br />
Fear!  -  erm, this dun count... i think everyone's experienced an empty plane of fear.<br />
<br />
Dreadlands - 4 groups, one works over the far side of the tunnel, one works from the tunnel towards karnors, one from vie toward karnor's and one picks off the caves n anything else it finds, heading along the north wall.  &quot;shout 47 cleric lfg... erm... lfm (looking for mob!)&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaesora - Holy wow are there a lotta mobs packed tight in this joint.  work 2 groups and AE the hell outta 'em, one top down and the other start in the temple area.<br />
<br />
Freeport - GuildRaid:  split a few groups into each section of freeport and just systematically destroy the joint.  Corrupt?  Paladin?  Let their gods sort them out!<br />
<br />
Grey - Pity the groups assigned to the sun rev's and other 'once' tough mobs near letalis zone.  2 groups each section, handles local roamers, 2 groups working out from the temple, and 2 groups picking up from the scarlet zone.  Wait, wait, wait... TRAPS  EFF!  we almost had it till MoMo the bard ran over 12 traps =(  /cackle<br />
<br />
I figure AT BEST some of these zones probably have 20 mins to complete the task and screenshot the tracklists... be a hella fun challange.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hehe sounds something to do when you have no raid targets up and people are bored =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say you'd need alot of people to this, spawn times in zones is too fast.<br />
<br />
I have seen it happen once and once only.<br />
<br />
Skyfire the weekend Ragefire changed - 98 people in zone and not 1 thing on track in 4 laps of the zone.  It got to a point where everyone in the raid was pulling and when someone was lucky enough to find something it was quickly dispatched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember when Sullon Zek started.<br />
<br />
190 halflings in Misty Thicket.  Something spawned BAM it was dead.  But I guess all the guards were up so it didnt quite meet the requirements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macnbaish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Plane of Fear gets completely cleared all the time, my guild has done it.. It's pretty cool running around with nothing on track.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The ragefire change in skyfire was awesome.<br />
<br />
Sooo many mobs normally in that zone<br />
<br />
No mobs up that week.</div></div><hr />

You could do this pretty easily in a low level zone like Crushbone.  Run through the zone aggroing all of the mobs, drag them to a corner, and PBAoE them.  If you get a ranger to help, you should be able to find and clear all of the mobs in just a few minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's actually a lot of fun, and you mind end up with an uber shiny brass shield !!! =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tendalus Treepimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The key is to have your wizzard twink waiting for this whole train... as you aggro the mobs, take some hits and heal yourself to generate some definite aggro... do this a few times to assure that they really hate you... then bring them to your wizzie twink and blast off your lowest damage AE spell.  Do 1-2 dmg, then just SotW and DS with your druid and kill the mobs by chain sitting... Ding 5 levels for your twink =)</div></div><hr />
