<br />
Now I've been having a blast with my Feral druid alt in PvP since the patch, he's lvl 26 and full of piss 'n vinegar. This means that if I see a lvl 35 nearby I'll attack... and die.<br />
<br />
My complaint is I noticed that more and more players seem to have a lvl 60 stuck to their butts,either 2 boxing it or a uber leet friend of theirs. Its not enough that they already have a few levels on me but if it appears I'm giving them a run for their money their buddy instantly comes to life to &quot;even&quot; the odds... SAD. Not only that but after their &quot;triumph&quot; over the lil druid that could they spam laugh me as if I just got outplayed. <br />
<br />
Actually I feel better now, Thanks for listening. Next post will be why my GF drives me bonkers hehe. :crazy:</div></div><hr />

My rogue is now 60 but when I was levelling him up I did my best to leave people alone. When people attacked him, I promptly burnt them to ash. Perhaps you should try being a little less aggressive?</div></div><hr />

On my server, it's all about calling in the &quot;boys&quot; if you get beat, even by a lower level.  In Un'Goro I engage in a fight a with a Warrior (he actually Jumped me go figure) and when I got him down to red, his Rogue friend, who I guess had been watching the whole time, jumped in, stunned me, and of course backstabbed.  Now, there is no guessing if I went down or not, but right after they felt the need to spam /spit /laugh /dance /golfclap as if I was severely gimped and no clue of what I was doing =/.  I later found the two of them alone individually and proceeded to ram my Red Power Crystals up their one-way hole.  <br />
<br />
A second encounter was actually lastnight.  I again found myself fighting an even level horde.  After I won, he came back about 10 minutes later with an couple (about 4) level 58's and they not only killed me, and the people I happen to be grouped with, but tried to camp us.  Being the type of person I am, and switched on my PS2 and waited to see just how much of a loser these guys were =).  I think they lasted 30 minutes before leaving haha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or they are just immature and young. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lycann</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, seems this is getting worse and worse on Archimonde, now the horde (not biased to horde im sure alliance does it to) think its appropriate to run lower levels in alliance territory and when they get jumped by an alliance and their flag is enabled then the ?? ... usually rogue ... jumps out and get the kill he so obviously deserves. Picture me rolling my eyes here. <br />
<br />
This occured to me in Gnomer, I was hunting when i noticed an undead mage 4 levels above me, i figure wow brave lil guy wondering into enemy territory... I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN that wasn't the case, so I stupidly think, hey I wonder if i can take a 36 mage. I never found out. This was all a dupe to get me to initiate an attack set me for PvP in which a ?? rogue smacked me down. The mage didn't even try to beat me, he literally just waited for his friend. All i could manage to say to my guildies was &quot;GAY&quot;. I didnt even feel in the mood to explain my comment. <br />
<br />
So either I lvl to 60 right away before having fun in PvP or I go check out Guildwars. I like winning but if that means going into a fight im guaranteed to win? then no thanks.</div></div><hr />

There are only a handful of people in WoW that are truly looking for a challenge in their oppenents.  Everyone else just wants the easiest safest kill without any fear of death.  I was camped in Silithus, literally trapped a few days ago, Horde killed the Gryphon trainer there, then they killed everyone as they just landed.  it's funny because we died so fast that they got no honor for it.  Then we just waited them out =).</div></div><hr />

As a Lv 60 Druid, I was sitting there chatting with a lv 51 Mage who wanted to know about hunting zones.... when I was attacked by a lv 16 druid.  I stood there and laughed at him jumping around and healing himself from the damage my thorns were doing.  A lv 23 shaman came up to help him and heal him while he attacked..  The mage and I were in stiches...  Almost broke my heart when I finally Moonfired him and watched it rot his life away..   The mage cast an immolation at the Shaman who barely survived it then sheeped him while we danced with him..    When the Druid got back and rebuffed/healed he attacked the mage... He did not survive the immolate but at least stayed alive a while by ducking around trees.  <br />

I guess that's the downside of not being able to see what level the PC is that you are fighting.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol Starfire.  Do you actually buy the bottle of Booze in RL, :) or buy some dwarven stout or something?  <br />
<br />
I just got a friend into WoW, and have been helping him lvl, primarily in instances with my 50 druid.  I took him through VC and Blackfathom Deeps just me and him a couple times, either so that he could get all the loot, or when he couldn't find an appropriate PuG.  I eventually got bored doing this so I started a priest alt to run with him (which I have out lvld him since =/  hes now 33 and I'm 36 go figure).<br />
<br />
When I'd run instances with him as my druid, he was always getting jacked with, especially around BFD.  A couple times, we were waiting outside for maybe one other low lvl person to come with, and I was sitting stealthed in cat for fun.  One time, two horde, each 4 lvls above him (hes a pally) attacked him and I was tempted to just wreck them.  Instead, I pounced on one, then switched out into caster form and healed him repeatedly.  They both tripped out when they saw a ?? druid come out of stealth to assist his buddy.  But I let it be a fair fight.. well, as much as it could be as 2v1 .. by just healing and not attacking them.  They didnt even try to attack me, thinking that they'd get a HK on him before I killed them.  He was all jazzed when he ended up killing them both.<br />
<br />
I remember back when I was in my 20's, and running around in Astranaar, and I'd be in the middle of a fair fight with a horde, 1 on 1, and then out of nowhere a 'lock or mage or rogue on epic mount would come out of nowhere, sit and watch till the horde i was fighting would be at around 1/4 health, and kill me in one hit.  Always frustrating.:mad2:   Though I can understand helping your bretheren.<br />
<br />
My policy now is that I don't fight anyone more than 5 lvls below me.  Though it is tempting sometimes for revenge purposes...</div></div><hr />

The girls are dressed in white gowns and they hold candles in their hands. One of them is Lucia and she has a crown of candles on her head. The boys are &quot;Stj&#228;rngossar&quot; (star lads). They also wear white gowns and on their heads they wear a white paper cone with golden stars on it. In their hands they carry a stick with a big golden star on the top. They parade and sing special Lucia songs. The history of the &quot;Stj&#228;rngossar&quot; is much older than the history of Lucia, but about a hundred years ago those traditions were united and the modern Lucia celebration was born. The tradition started on the westcoast of Sweden and has spread over the country. As with most traditions in Sweden it`s an odd combination of Christian and pagan rituals.<br />
<br />
I belive it can translated as Lucia Train. Lucia refers to St. Lucia, who was martyrd in the 3rd or 4th century:).<br />

Haha.. ya swedes are pretty special. The viking never liked the christian belief so they made som alterations. ;)'<br />
I think it is a combination of &quot;midvinterblod&quot; and christian beliefs. &quot;Midvinterblot&quot; translates &quot;Mid winter blood&quot; (a viking pagan tradition to Oden or some other god from Valhalla.. I'm not a scholar). They sacrificed animals and ate pshycadelic mushrooms and sh*t..<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucia Train&quot; is the correct translation (if it exists one).. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The actual historical facts surrounding the birth of Christ are clouded in mystery. No one really knows when Jesus was born. Only certain facts can be deducted from the biblical account and from history. For one thing, Jesus was definitely born in B.C. (Before Christ!). This is known because Herod the Great died in 4 B.C., and Herod figures in the account of the Nativity given by St. Matthew. Jesus was definitely not born in winter. St. Luke mentions that the shepherds were staying out in the pasture land with their flocks, an event that does not take place in winter. We must look elsewhere for the origin of the late December celebration of the Nativity.<br />
 We find the origin of the winter feast of the Nativity not in the historical facts available concerning the birth of Christ, but in a curious astronomical phenomenon. In late December we reach the shortest day of the year with more hours of darkness than daylight. From this point the hours of daylight become gradually longer. This observable phenomenon was given a religious significance in the pagan Roman world. It became the feast of Sol Invictus (the Unconquerable Sun). It was popularly celebrated in Rome during the last two weeks of December as Saturnalia. What better time for the Christians to celebrate the coming of the true unconquered &quot;Sun&quot;? Thus the feast of Christmas was born; the celebration of the dawning on the world of the Sun of Righteousness.<br />
<br />
The feast was not originally called Christmas or Nativity, but Epiphany or &quot;Manifestation.&quot; It celebrated the idea of Christ's coming and manifesting Himself through several events of the New Testament and its timing was based on the feast of the Unconquered Sun. In the East this feast of &quot;coming&quot; was generally kept on January 6th and in the West on December 25th.<br />
<br />
Christmas is not literally the day of Christ's Birth, but the day of Christ's Mass. The celebration of his coming not his birth.<br />
<br />
Anyway, whether you belive in Christ, or you believe people are just deluding themselves, anything that causes people to be a little nicer, a little more giving, and a little more tolerant is a good thing.<br />

So I was doing the Duke Hyrdraxis quest in EPL (ya I'm way behind on getting my Tidal loops) and this horde Rogue and Warrior both 60 are killing the 56 mage and her companion who were there killing the Surges.  I help out as any would do when some of their faction comes under duress and a NE rogue just happened to be there as well.  We will the two hordies and go about our business.  Usually when something like this I tend to be cautious because I know PvP never ends unless the other side knows they cannot win.  The 2 horde return and wait until I am locked in deadly combat with a Discordant Surge and they strike, of course I died because I got a 56 Mob beating on me, a Rogue backstabbing, and a Warrior &quot;tanking&quot; me lol.  <br />
<br />
Usually I don't mind dieing but I know an act of insult when I see one.  And they meant to insult me when they ATE MY BODY.  Yeah Astrel is reaching into his bag for some more red power crystals now.  I come back, and find the Rogue still picking on the 56 mage.  W00t 1200 Ravage Crit, and 2 Claw Crits = One dead rogue.  I still had full health.  The Warriors shows up and I root him.  Then I did a /laugh at him. Waited a few seconds, dropped into bear and mauled his face.  He tried to run, at which point I played around with him.  I let him lead ahead and I just kept charging him.  Then I finally decided to end it and rooted him again.  While casting Starfire I did /bye to him, and then it hits him for a 900 crit. hahaha...<br />

Wait...I guess I was the sore loser that time &gt;.&lt; .  They left me alone though.  And I was done with my quest 10 minutes later.</div></div><hr />

I was hunting with my orc buddy in stonetalon shredding stuff up in my new kitty form, probably lvl 23-24 at this point.  A ?? NE Druid shows up and spends about 45 mins to an hour following us around, challenging to duels and walking all over the mobs we are attacking.  Well it happened, while in kitty form I fired off a shred just after the mob died, it targetted him and flagged me.  He basically killed me with a Moonfire and root.  I ran back, even though I knew he was stealthed and I was flagged I popped back, hit kitty form and insta stealthed.  He still found me and killed me again.  My ghost unflagged and I was all set from then on out but he followed us while we killed stuff working on quests for at least another 45 minutes.  I'll get him.  And everytime I see him I will attack him and if possible corpse or graveyard camp him.  He was a coward and disgrace to druids.<br />

Thanks for letting me vent even if no one reads this.</div></div><hr />

We've gotten in the habit of facing each other now when we group to prevent it.  Not that we are so much worried about being flaged but when we're questing we dont want have worry about some PvPer coming around and making a nussance to us.<br />

Though I do have a good story of revenge on those one that try to flag make you flag your self when you dont mean to.  My wife (mage30) and myself (druid29) were in STV killing trolls for the blood fangs quest.  Well along comes this warlock 36 and promtly jumps on top of the troll we were killing in hopes I might roar or mistarget and flag myself.  Well we saw him coming so had no worries.  Well after he figured out we were not going to fall for that trick he starts to fear the mobs we engage in hopes they will run to thier friends so that more come back.  We spend a good 30 mins to hour doing this moving around in hope he would just leave us alone.  Wife just really didnt want to mess with PVP.  So we got tired and desided to run to town.  And sure enough this warlock follows us to town as well the whole time taunting us.  Well as we ran into town we happen to see a 34 warrior with the guild name PvP Raiders...  So in passing we happen to mention there is a flagged warlock outside town.  Well he goes charging out to fight the lock.  I deside at this point I wanted to give him bit loving as well so strt to sneak out there as well.  Needless to say the warrior got feared right off and was about 1/2 dead by time I got out there.  As I was working into range to help/heal this 54 shaman Tauren lighten bolts that poor warlock that never saw him coming.  silly lock was dead in about two hits.</div></div><hr />
