I need a parser and can't find a link to a simple log based parser.  Yalp... no links work... EQCompanion... no links work.  Someone has to know where I can find a link that works.  <br />

Hook a brother up, will ya?</div></div><hr />

Yay!<br />
 <br />
Now the only problem is none of the older verions I have DL'd seem to work, because they are missing or I am missing some file.  Ah well, I guess I just need to not worry about DPS and keep healing.  Thanks anyway Tenielle.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why it wouldn't work just as well for a druid!</div></div><hr />
