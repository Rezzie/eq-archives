The problem is that there are no Resistance leather that can be crafted for Hydross the unstable.My current plan is making a resistance set based on some old epics <br />
I have basically enchanting it with all resists and adding void spheres.Now the main problem is that I hit a nice 140 all resistance with said gear but it is nowhere near enough to get my frost and nature ready for Hydross who we are taking down this weekend. Any tips on gear that might improve frost and nature resists in a short amount of time would be greatfull.</div></div><hr />

I'm currently rocking a full set of greens for Restist gear.<br />
<br />
I'm an OT for that fight though, so I've got 150 Frost and 150 Nature.<br />
<br />
Just hit the AH for green &quot;Of Frost Protection&quot; or &quot;Of Nature Protection&quot;. <br />
<br />
Just make sure you get as much Stamina as you can, usually from Cloth items.<br />
<br />
If you're going to MT, you want to max out at 295 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
**EDIT** Wrong resist for MT listed. I'm a newb.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty much all you can do, right there.<br />
<br />
My guild usually has warriors MT it, but last week only one Prot warrior was on, so I MTed Hydross with 296 Nature resist unbuffed (366 with hunter aura). This week, no prot warriors are on, so I just helped a druid gear up for Frost Resist last night... The method? The AH. Just get any gear you can use with enough resist on it. Cloth or leather; it doesn't matter. You may need to get the JC ring or necklace made, in which case you've got a little bit of farming, but you can probably get by in all greens and some resist enchants.<br />
<br />
As an OT, just shoot for, like Kaur said, 150 of each... but even then, you can probably do it in less. I've heard of druids doing it in their regular tank gear.</div></div><hr />

Also my T1 T2 and T3 compensates for the items im missing atm as well as my dungeon 2 so I have a nice all resistance value of 121. Replace a few of that gear with resistance and resistance armour kits and bobs your uncle. Just hope I make it in time since the AH is empty.</div></div><hr />

With a hunter in your group you can get +70 nature resist aura.  That should take you above 200 resistance in both schools.<br />
<br />
There is also something called the Flask of Chromatic Resistance available to alchemists with lots of Violet Eye rep, although I suspect this doesn't stack with the above auras.  Might still be handy though, in case your paladin or hunter dies.<br />

<br />
<br />
Elementals<br />
Elemental-based melee attacks (such as Hydross or most Fire Elementals) follow slightly different rules than normal melee attacks versus a player.<br />
- Elementals can crit the player but will never crush<br />
- Elemental melee damage is not mitigated by AC in any fashion<br />
- Cannot be blocked<br />
- Can be parried or dodged<br />
- Can be partially resisted through the appropriate resist stat<br />
- Attack power modification debuffs such as Demoralizing Shout will affect damage done<br />
