You get 1 vote at this so take some days / weeks to think about it before  voting.<br />
<br />
Pick whats closest, sure there could be more options but generally pick the best you can. <br />

<br />
It's a terrible expansion.  I cant figure out who they are trying to appeal this to, besides masochists...  the list of problems and bad design decisions goes on and on, i could type pages about it... it's *worse* than PoP was at release, and that was really bad.<br />
<br />
It's like the dev team decided to take ALL the worst ideas from each of the expansions, ignore EVERYTHING that they learned and had to change in Luclin and PoP, and throw eq back to the stone-age of both class balance and gameplay.<br />
<br />
I'll be happy to write that essay, soon  as someone from SOE shows up and seems to give a damn about making their product fun, or at least more about that than endless timesinks and bottlenecks to keep the peons feeding their credit card numbers in every month.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've about had it... this expansion was supposed to be the raid expansion, the continuation of PoP.  But it's not... you get dozens of these damned 6-person encounters that you *have* to do, not only that but you MUST have the holy trinity carry you along.  The primary raiding type seems, again, to be limited to about half of what became required in PoP!  That's not progression!  Why are you breaking up my guild that we took forever to baloon up to meet your rediculous PoP encounters?<br />
<br />
To paraphrase a GoD dev, &quot;We dont like large encounters.  Balancing for 72 people is too hard and we arent going to do it anymore.&quot;  WHAT?!  IT'S YOUR JOB!  LEARN TO DO IT, the people who designed PoP managed.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />

Sorry, some of that essay seems to have escaped!<br />

<br />
And to get anywhere decently in GoD, your need to have good gear.<br />
<br />
So elemental farming to continue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It turns out that, as I predicted, neither of us go there because, again as I predicted, it really isn't for us.  We are not elemental geared and there are many other things we want to do in the other expansions.<br />
<br />
So, I don't know abou the quality of the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is an ok expansion for alot of people. But, for me it just does not work for me. I like the fact that corpse runs are harder. the &quot;holy trinity&quot; is really pronounced here in this expansion. I like having misfit groups with a ranger tanking for pete's sake. The mobs just hit to hard. not really challenging me just like exping off vindi really. they need to bring back some older stuff like low hitting mobs... lots of mobs throw some unique abilities on em and voila! fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenidina</div><div class="date">03-05-2004, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't mind the corpse runs, the hard to get to zones, etc.  I do mind not being able to find groups because I am a druid.  I do mind that any trial after Tipt needs 2 clerics and that we just won't cut it as a secondary healer.  I love saying in GUild LFG when all the clerics are looking for a 2nd cleric for their group and all the druids get told to Solo or go to POP or Ldon.  While I like POP and Ldon I want to explore the new expansion just like everyone else, and by reading about what everyone else is writing about it is just making me more bitter about the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild are not raid machine :whistle:, if you raid a lot buy it, if you don't raid, don't bother, it will take for ever before you can really enjoy the expansion. They might as well have put GoD access after TIME access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still vote LoY for the absolute worst.  We should not have had to pay for the features the expansion introduced, and the content just sucked.  IMO the only worthwhile thing to come from LoY was pure blood/blood of nadox.<br />
 <br />
Best expansion is a toss up for me, PoP or Luclin.  Yeah Luclin had its probs, but it's content was incredibly vast.  The thing I disliked about GoD the most wasn't the departure from Norrath content, but that it was so dark.  It's more like a horror flick and has raids to match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lattrine</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When GoD came out, I was semi-retired. When I came back to EQ I leveled to 65 and started to spend a bit of time in places such as the sewers, and barindu. Now being in a high end guild, I find GoD to be a fun expansion. I did hate it at first, since it took me 7 attempts to win a Tipt trial to get KT flagged, but after spending a fair bit of time I have come to enjoy it. It is quite challenging the further in you go (can anyone say adds/ramp/flurry?), but the risk/reward ratio makes it worthwhile. The thing I don't like about GoD is the look of the same old temples and dreary colors of the mobs. I would say my favorite expansion by far is PoP, then SoV. I still remember fondly getting hit in the 130s by frost giant adds in GD, ah memories... :)</div></div><hr />
