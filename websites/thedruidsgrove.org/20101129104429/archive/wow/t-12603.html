What i am curious to know is what area's i could possibly improve my gear before heading into Heroic's/Kara or if i can infact jump right into those dungeons with what i've got.<br />
<br />
 http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Arygos&amp;n=Slaide &lt;---my armory page.<br />
<br />
two things i am working toward, a pair of these http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30841 from Lower City rep           and<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29189 from Honor Hold rep. <br />
<br />
With the addition of these upgrades do you think i would be ready for healing heroics/Kara?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't access Armory while I'm at work, but from your bonus healing number you're probably beyond ready to start Kara and lower heroics.  LC Prayerbook (which I'm still using, BTW :lmao:) and the head ench would just be icing on the cake.<br />

Oops, Zute posted while I was typing.  To answer your question, you CAN equip two LC Prayerbooks for the bonus healing, however, they share a cooldown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely go with the double Prayerbooks, which is one of the best resto druid trinket combos in 2.4, *IMHO*, until you get the alchemy trinket and Memento of Tyrande from Illidan.  (I'm currently using the alchemy trinket and one Prayerbook.)<br />
<br />
If you have more honour than you know what to do with, you could use one Prayerbook and the Battlemaster trinket, but the difference in bonus healing here is quite small.<br />
<br />
You may consider swapping out one Prayerbook for Bangle of Endless Blessings for less downtime on trash, but I find it usually isn't necessary (because we already have almost no downtime on trash).<br />
<br />
As for your legs, consider investing in the 2.3 or 2.4 badge legs, as either will far outshine the Opera legs and either pair will last you until T6.  As far as boot upgrades go, you're going to be relying on raids for those (Chess -&gt; Leo -&gt; Rage or Anetheron ... I forget which one).</div></div><hr />

For a druid healer +1100 is way better than +1100 for a priest or a pally.  Plus you'll gear up quick in Kara and you'll have access to tons of badges if your guild/group is clearing fairly far into Kara.  I earn 15-22 badges a week in Kara for very little time comitment.</div></div><hr />

This won't be such a big issue in Kara where almost everything is UD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so your saying Prot Pally is a viable MT for all of Kara? or will we need a Backpack OT (Bear/Warrior) to switch in for any specific boss encounter?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kara has some amazing healing drops with a decent drop rate.  Also, some decent T4 content.  In fact, there are items in Kara that will drop &quot;too often&quot; :rolleyes: .  <br />
<br />
So, if have you have patience, save your badges to use towards gear that you finally give in to buying to replace the gear that just will not drop for you.<br />
<br />
EG:  Maiden or Prince's Maces.</div></div><hr />

The undead, concecration thing makes their agro generation amazing.  Plus you'll find for them, its not always +spell damage.  There are lots of weird obscure talents that shoot their agro generation through the roof.  If you check Wolflord on Whisperwind, you can find an example of a very well geared pally tank (for Kara level).  His agro generation is off the hook.  I pretty much can't catch him.  I've pounded on the mob full bore and I've TRIED to pull agro off him.<br />

We have used Warriors and druids for specific fights, but really there isn't a fight in Kara any tank can't do, its just other specific support classes that you may need to bring to offset their negatives.</div></div><hr />

QFT.  When I first started running Kara it was with a paladin MT.  The only bosses I tanked were Maiden (b/c our RL thought that paladins couldn't tank it), and Prince (because Prince hits like a truck and my mitigation was FAR BEYOND where our paladin's was).</div></div><hr />

If you plan on MH'ing anything, the +healing weapon enchant is a must.  <br />
<br />
I don't pass on upgrades, but I certainly feel like it sometimes because of the various expense's (enchants, gems, etc.) that come with your new loot.  It's rather bittersweet. :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
I run all of my heroics with 2 hunters, a Rogue with a Pally tank.  Although, I can't offer much assistance on this Heroic Ramp fight (never done it actually), I can say that too much melee is rather tough on a healer.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
FR is not a must, but if your party's gear is kind of subpar for blowing through these heroics, then some FR on your tank will help by decreasing the healing he needs (therefore allowing you to spend more time healing the damage the party will take).<br />
<br />
Really, the fireballs and the fire patches they spawn shouldn't be a problem for anyone.  If one lands on you, just move.  While you're moving you can still keep the HoTs up on the tank and put a stack or two of Lifebloom on yourself to heal the damage.  Tell DPS to bandage, pot, or healthstone when they can so that you can keep your focus keeping yourself and the tank alive.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;too much melee&quot; concern, as long as your melee aren't idiots and stand in the fire (your tank has to be good at moving the boss around if a fireball gets shot at one of the melee players as well) then this shouldn't be a problem for you, either.</div></div><hr />

Nazrudans fireballs where DDing me for almsot 2.5K. the rest of the dungeon was not a problem in the slightest, it just seemed like we went from blowing through the dungeon to getting stomped at this specific fight. very disheartening.</div></div><hr />
