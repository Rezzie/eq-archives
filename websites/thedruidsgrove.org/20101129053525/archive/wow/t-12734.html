<br />
but what are the arathi basin reward boots that are mentioned?<br />
<br />
*2nd edit* that chart is a little confusing... it looks like with the PvP set and FS, if i dash, i should SMOKE someone that's mounted with a riding crop, but that's just not the case... i'm just a smidge faster than someone mounted when i dash... can someone explain this to me plzkthxbai</div></div><hr />

I have the PvP armor bonus and the talent. According to the chart I was sprinting at 195% speed. And when sprint faded I popped into travel form which should have given me 161% speed.<br />
<br />
The rogue caught up to me at the bottom of the ramp leading up to the Lumber Mill. I had run non-stop at top speed starting at the BS flag. It's mind boggling to me that a rogue could catch me unmounted. I thought it was only hunter pets I couldn't out run. I'm having an identity crisis. :crazy:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never paid much attention to the speed bonuses (stacking or multiplying, etc.), though I do miss them (whatever the values are) when I'm inside.</div></div><hr />

Rogues also have spring so it's possible he used that.  It's also possible he then used preparation to resprint as soon as it was up.  Though it strikes me as a rather desperate move just to kill someone in AB.  =x</div></div><hr />

I hadn't considered preparation. Good call.</div></div><hr />
