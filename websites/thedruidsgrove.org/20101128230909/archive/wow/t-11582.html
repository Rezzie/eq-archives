<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blueboy</div><div class="date">02-22-2007, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been looking around in our forum and have countless info on playing a moonkin and gearing up and stats to build on. So far I have 520 +spells, 14% crit, 7100 mana pool unbuffed. I have mostly leather gear with 3 other items of cloth gear.  I have heard of other Moonkins with +800 spell and 8000+ mana pool. So far, I have now leveled to 70 and notice leather/casting gear for moonkin has slowed down and see a lot of Healing gear now dropping in dungeons. Quest rewards now are mostly “cloth” type caster gear. I’m very happy with my gear but was wondering if other Moonkins could point me in the right direction on getting more out of my Moonkin with gear?  Maybe go all cloth?</div></div><hr />

I'm not at all hitting harder then most classes, but I hit close from what I hear. highest crit with starfire has been 29xx damage. (with a trinket but yeah..)<br />
<br />
I know that these items are on my shoping list of level 70 gear:<br />

With the next patch I'm hoping there will be some nicer weapons relesed, I would like to see a 2 handed mace ment for us moonkins. (one with a good solid +120 spell damage, and some crit, mana regen would be nice aswell)<br />

ive also seens a screen shot of an item I think all druids will adore.<br />

for PvP I highly recommend wearing leather +dmg armor but if PvE is your main focus, there is nothing wrong with wearing a couple cloth pieces here and there. My friend who's respec'ed moonkin when his guild said they didn't fully require him to be resto wears almost 80% cloth armor. It's fine because all he does is instances and raids and he shouldn't be getting hit anyways.</div></div><hr />

I have seen a few cloth-wearing Balance druids in the BGs.  They make toast of ppl pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

haven't heard anything, but I'm pretty sure auras can not stack.</div></div><hr />
