<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kreysan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody did this quest recently? <br />
<br />
I was camping a necro in Lesser Faydark on and off, for past 3 weeks, taking turns with my cleric friend in hopes that one of us will get lucky. Is this quest still working? Maybe just bad luck.<br />
<br />
We tried pretty much all suggested strategies but nothing worked so far. <br />
<br />
I know there is better gear out there but I would really really like to have this item =) Can anyone tell me how do I make that guy spawn ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have to get him to spawn at a specific time of day ... let me see if I can find the quest write-up I wrote about 2 years ago.... brb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Hi, okay- I'll just write it out step by step.  And then I'll tell you exactly how to do everything.  It might seem long, but that's because I'm a detail freak.  If you get bored at any time, skip to step 7 which can be done whenever and you'll get experience while you do it.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
1. Get 4 Bone Chips<br />
Easy enough.  Kill skeletons, decaying skeletons, etc.  They're everywhere.<br />
 <br />
2. Get 4 Ghast Hearts<br />
Go to Lesser Faydark.  Make sure you have Wolf Form on at ALL TIMES because you won't be KOS to the Brownies that way.  You will be using your tracking skill constantly.  If you see something on track named &quot;Equestrielle the Corrupted&quot; that is a very dangerours evil unicorn with a 400+ HP Harm Touch.  I wasn't ever killed by it, but a few times it managed to nearly kill me.  Basically know where the zones are at all times and watch your ass when it is around.<br />
What you will be Looking for is called &quot;a ravaorchous ghast&quot;.  (Spelling isn't 100% correct, but you'll see what I mean)  There are rumors that they only spawn at night, but I don't think that's true as I killed them day and night.  They are difficult to find, but I had great success by running around on the paths closest to the Greater Faydark zone.  Keep tracking, and look for them anywhere on the list.  Usually they will be in the 1st 5 or the bottom 5.  But check the whole list.  If you find one, you can press &quot;i&quot; (for inventory) &quot;i&quot; (push it again) to keep tracking a target while canceling the tracking window.  Once you find one, immediately snare it, and combust it.  A couple of swings of your sword/club and it'll fall.  (They're easy to kill).  Keep doing this until the stupid things give you 4 hearts.  You only need 4.<br />
 <br />
3. Get the Initiate Symbol of Tunare<br />
This is the first piece.  Go to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf in Falewithe (he's a cleric - that's the green hut that faces the lake, you have to do a 180 as soon as you see the lake).  Give him a 'hail' and give him the bone chips.  Then say what he says to say, i think it is 'i want to be an initiate of tunare'.  Give him the ghast hearts (all 4 at once).  You now have the Initate.  It is a crappy +1 WIS +something else with a weird effect.  It is just a Resist enancement self-only that lasts 30 seconds, but it doesn't matter because you will turn it in soon for something better.  Then say 'i will slay the necromancer'.<br />
 <br />
&lt;strong&gt; <br />
4. The heads.<br />
Bind yourself right where the path starts coming out of the GFay zone in Lesser Faydark.  Go to the undead spires, and prepare your camp.  At 2pm EQ time, kill the skeleton on the bottom step of the spires.  He is on a 15 minute spawn-timer.  Kill the others too after about 7 minutes.  Make sure you are full mana when the 15 minutes comes back.  You are trying to get a named necromancer to spawn in the skeleton on the bottom step's place.  At 7pm (15 minutes after 2pm) kill whatever is there.  And do the same again at 12am (another 15 minutes) and at 5 or 6 am (another 15 minutes).  The necro should spawn sometime during the night.  If not, you might need to try a 2nd night.  As soon as the necro is dead (he's easy, two combusts at most, be sure to snare) loot it fast (get the head) and GATE!  This should put you right on the trail.  There is a dark elf couriour right there.  (Track him if you have to).  Snare him (he has SoW) and blast the crap out of him too.  He is running to the dark elf camp, but try not to let him get there.  Loot his head and his crate.<br />
&lt;/strong&gt; <br />
5. Diciple Symbol of Tunare<br />
Go back to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf in Falewithe and give him the two heads, the crate, and your initiate symbol of tunare.  You should recieve the diciple symbol of tunare.  It is a slight improvement, but who cares, you are leaving.  Say what he wants you to say, I think it is 'I am ready to become a Warden of Tunare'.  He gives you a candle and long instructions.<br />
 <br />
6. Tilani in Erudin Palace<br />
Gate to Tox, go to Erudin, find the enchanter's guild.  (It has a yellow overhang, umm - make a left after going through the 2nd teleporter?  I can't remember exactly- that city is confusing).  Tilani is on the 2nd floor of the guild, near some beds and stuff.  Give her the candle, and she gives you a suspension and some instructions.  Bind yourself right in front of her (so you don't have to find this damn place again) and proceed to step...<br />
 <br />
7. Various items<br />
a. Red Dust can be found on the goblins in Lavastorm or in SolA.  It randomly drops on almost everything in SolA, and on the fire goblins that AREN'T near the druid ring or SolA in lavastorm.  I actually got it off the 1st gob I killed in lavastorm, at the goblin camp just to the east of Najena.<br />
b. White Hellebore can be found on gnolls inside Paw.  Either get in a group and enjoy some exp until you find it, or just SoW, invis, and sit next to a group that's killing things.  Eventually it'll drop.  I don't think it's NO DROP, but when you ask for some, everyone is always curious what it is for.  Now they'll know.  I believe it is failry common<br />
c. Caustic Fluid -(hardest part of entire quest)-  You need to go to Mistmore Castle and kill a Dark Offerer.  They spawn inside of the castle (only?  not sure about that) which can make it a bit harder.  Get a group and become a EXP vacuum.  Start in the jail, and work your way in.  I found one deep inside (while creeping around invised.. watch out, vampires can see thru invis) and got myself damn near killed jumping it (whole zone fell on me and my partner because of a bad pull, oops).  Just yell that you want some and you might get some help as it is NO DROP and useless to anyone else.<br />
 <br />
8. Brew-ha-ha<br />
Gate to Misty Thicket, go into Rivervale, go upstairs in Fool's Tavern, and go to the brewing barrel.  Put the 4 ingredients (red dust, white hellebore, caustic fluid, and suspension thing that Tilani gave you) and brew it.  You can't fail even w/ 0 brewing skill.<br />
 <br />
9. Tilani (again)<br />
Gate back to Tilani in Erudin.  Give her the thingie that's created (can't remember what it's called) and she gives you a unanimation powder.<br />
 <br />
10. Warden Symbol of Tunare<br />
Gate to Steamfont or Butcherblock and run to Falewithe.  Go back to Yeolarn Bronzeleaf and give him the powder and your Diciple Symbol of Tunare.  You will get the Warden Symbol of Tunare.<br />
 <br />

[/quote]I put the part you're probably looking for in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;.  Sorry if it makes no sense, I wrote it a long-ass time ago..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valorin Diamante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I followed that exact write up from Jigsaw and had the necro in one day.  <br />
<br />
It is worth completing and when fighting Elaysians it is soooo helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow - I just reread my own guide..<br />
<br />
..using I, I to cancel the tracking window without losing a target<br />
<br />
..joining groups in Paw and MM<br />
<br />
<br />
wow - that really was a long time ago<br />
<br />
best part was I was still wearing that thing at level 65 just because I had a lot of fun doing this quest, LoL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kreysan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for your guide Jigsaw. We are off to LF again , maybe finally we will get lucky. Hehe, he must show up one day.<br />
<br />
So we have to kill all spawns there, right? Someone told me to kill ONLY the skellie on the bottom step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its been a long time... but I killed them because when I did this I was low enough of a level that I risked pulling all of them on top of me making it way more difficult!  ;) <br />
<br />
Just follow my guide to the letter, and you'll get it.. unless they've changed the quest in the last 2 years..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kreysan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Two days later, not only I got necro's head, but I also have 2 backpacks of foraged food, 3 stacks of morning dew, and enough bone chips to start myself a necromancer. Hehe, so I am off to finish the third step :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sweet, best of luck and enjoy your clicky root<br />
<br />
pisses enchanters off, i love it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valorin Diamante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gratz!!!</div></div><hr />
