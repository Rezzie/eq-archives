<br />
The dps trinket has 24 crit (2% i think) and a 200 ap buff on a cooldown (2 min I think)<br />
<br />
The tank trinket has 24 or so defense and a 900 health buff on a cooldown (also 2 min I think)<br />
<br />
I'm leaning toward the dps trinket, as I already have about 10k health and 15.5k ac in my full tanking gear, fully buffed (imp, motw, fort).  Though I don't know how big a role defense will play in future dungeons, and the periodic 900 health buff sounds nice.<br />
<br />
Which should I grab?</div></div><hr />

I took the tanking one.  It is like a mini last stand.  The cooldown on both of the trinkets is 5 mins.  We do get our +25% health on this so in bear form you get 1125 hp.  I have found it very useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-24-2007, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I faced a similar decision, as did the other druids in my guild.<br />
<br />
The healing trinket was dismissed outright, as my healing lead even told me not to take it: I need to level, I need a trinket that supports that, and there should be better healing trinkets at 70.<br />
<br />
Then it came down to bear and cat. Well, crit and ap are nice, but defense and an emergency 900+ health would be useful as well. We tend to tank a fair bit in BC, so it seemed logical, but here's what I figured.<br />
<br />
With primal fury and iLotP, +2% crit is perfect for bear and cat. We get better rage and combo point generation, as well as a nice small burst of damage from 200 AP. I noticed, with swipe and that trinket, it was much easier to hold 3-4 mobs in an instance, and I was generating so much rage I never had less than 70 once I got going.<br />
<br />
Plus, if you're leveling in cat, that trinket is very nifty. It has more use for both forms, rather than just bear--though, I suppose it'd give Cat form an emergency button.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it comes down to what you want and see yourself needing, but I took the Blackhand's Breath myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-24-2007, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up taking the tanking one, after talking to a buddy of mine that is a lv 68 hunter.  He showed me 2 really good dps trinkets that I'll get in the next few levels.  And as Ndainye said, there aren't really any tanking trinkets until higher levels.<br />
<br />
Also, I thought back to the original dilemma when I had finished the UBRS quest line for Mark of Tyrany v. Blackhand's Breath, and had to assume that I'd be as happy with the tanking trinket as I am with the Mark of Tyrany.  Now I just have to decide whether to swap it out for the Mark of Tyrany or the Smoking Heart of the Mountain.</div></div><hr />

I didn't take the tanking trinket...Same with the Mark of Tyranny. I don't like tanking too much but bleh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah same goes for me, I also took the dps trinket, I also have mark of tyranny and smoking heart and deciced I need a dps cat trinket. But I often find myself now trying to activate the trinket  when I am tanking lol (I put it in the action bar). So from time to time I unequip the smoking heart and equip this trinket in instances in Outland ^^<br />
<br />
@ Claritondeus: I can't wait to see new dps trinkets, atm my cat almost has 1400AP, and as we now more is always better!<br />
<br />
BTW I got 2x Mok'Nathal Clan Ring (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24151) for tanking now, w00t ^^  That is +32 sta and 1620ac extra in bear.<br />
<br />
Also Ursol's Claw (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24155) hasn't dropped for me in Rampage (yet), but a friend saw someone selling Braxxis' Staff of Slumber (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31186) for a respectable price, he bought it for me and ofc I payed him back, can't wait to turn level 64!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apep</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Id say that Ursol's Claw still is better than Braxxis' Staff of Slumber. It gives slightly more attackpower, adds some crit and 270 health. The armor bonus of Braxxis is nice, but afaik druids dont need more armor in bear since many are swapping tankgear for dpsgear nowadays to be able to generate rage and hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Gz on the staff, but if I where u id still chase Ursol's Claw. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repelsteel</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thnx :D<br />
Yeah I want Ursol's Claw anyway, it just haven't dropped yet!!<br />
BTW I am already trying to collect the mats for 25 agi on the Braxxis staff just like I have it on the Warden Staff. And the good thing is that I can enchant it myself now ^^<br />
<br />
Oww and I have seen a lvl 68 druid which had an even better blue staff than the Ursol and Braxxis staff and it looked freaking cool! Can't remember the name though. The guy literally flew away O.o<br />
<br />
WRONG! It is the Dreamer's Dragonstaff, required level was 70 in beta, 68 now:<br />
http://wow.warcry.com/bcdb/view_item.php?id=28325:0:0/WRONG!<br />
<br />
Edit: I was wrong, this is the staff I meant, it's a quest reward:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartidiot</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say you want both.  Ursol's is great for trash mobs and dps, which Braxxis is much better versus the hard hitting mobs.  It is the 2nd or 3rd best tanking druid weapon for mititgation so I feel it is worth the price.  <br />
<br />
The best one is http://www.goblinworkshop.com/beta-items/earthwarden.html and will be available to everyone once you get exalted with Cenarion Expedition.  So wait to turn in those CE quests  :)  Grind Slave Pens and Underbog until you get max honored so your rep grind is easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the cooldown on the DPS trinket is imba.<br />
<br />
I took that (Hey! feral at heart). :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's another trinket later you get from a quest: http://thottbot.com/beta?i=418<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if they stack, but the cooldowns aren't like, connected, so you can activate one then the other while the other's cooling down, which is pretty awesome (and both have a cooldown of 2 mins I think, or around that).  That +hit is nice too, I've been finding that it helps a lot especially for kitty.  <br />
<br />
I ran ramparts sooo many times for that damn claw, and it never dropped (nor the rings), so I gave up and bought the braxxis one, but I actually love the braxxis one for tanking, since so much gear is sta-heavy now it makes it easy to equip more sta to conpensate for the lack of stats on the staff.  W/fort+mark I now easily have 20k armor plus 10k life and almost 1200 AP, which is great.  I still need an enchant for it too, there's a 35 agi 2hander enchant I hear.  :)  I plan on doing the same with earthwarden, stacking on the sta gear along with it, should make for a great tanking combo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/beta?i=2955<br />
<br />
Mark of Conquest<br />
Equip: Increases attack power by 54.<br />
Equip: Sometimes heals bearer of 90 to 120 damage when damaging an enemy in melee.<br />
<br />
Seems like it would be really nice stacking with ILotp.<br />
Been using Darkmoon Card: Heroism and it is great.  Almost never have downtime between mobs while grinding.</div></div><hr />

Braxis or staff of beasts ,?<br />
With Braxis I got 17K armor and with beasts 13k but some more ap and sta<br />
http://www.thottbot.com/?i=57705 staff of beasts<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31186 braxxis staff of slumber</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">02-09-2007, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the situation I'd say and what you're tanking.  I have both those staves atm, and I use the braxxis more for tanking, except when I'm in lower level dungeons like mana tombs/underbog etc., but I do have some sta gear to compensate for the braxxis' lack of sta.  In places like shattered halls etc. where things are beating on your pretty hard (unless you CC everything) you're going to want more armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repelsteel</div><div class="date">02-09-2007, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here, I also got both of them, both with +25agi on it, and use the braxxis only for hard instances when tanking, for the rest of the time I use the staff of beasts.</div></div><hr />
