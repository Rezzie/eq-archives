For those who've continued to play, where are some of the better solo spots now?  Mammoths in TSS seem decent but geez, lot 'o hps.<br />
<br />
74 atm, closing in on 75, 'bout 9k mana / 9k hps, 1200aa so have the pre-TSS stuff mostly done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mammoths in icefall are great xp as long as you are using charm.<br />
<br />
Roots in Direwind are also good xp and seem to drop a good deal of rank II spells for your pp pleasure</div></div><hr />

Level 70, 160 AA's, hodge podge of mostly Time gear with Tier 1 GoD stuff.  I quit just after DoDh came out and I can honestly say I'm enjoying being back.  There have been some very positive changes in game play.  <br />
 <br />
As far as exp goes, I'm doing quite well with the leopards in Icefall.  I'm averaging 12 to 14% AA per kill solo and about 8% of an AA when I duo with my wifes Cleric.<br />
 <br />
I have heard that AA exp drops off between 71 and 75 so I'm wondering if I should just AA exp for a while before pushing for the next 5 levels.....</div></div><hr />

Killing yellow cons is still quite easy, making aa exp flow at least as fast as at 70.<br />
<br />
Spells from TSS are quite easy to get as well, so levelling should be the way to go.  And...its much easier to find groups as a level 75 than as a 70, should you be interested in grouping at all.<br />

Spiders in icefall are great exp, but the camps are usually taken.<br />
The Buried Sea is full of mostly not summoners, so is also good exp there.<br />
WoS is a hotspot, so if you can solo there, it can be good exp. (Solo only.. Group exp kinda sucks)<br />
 <br />
Edit: Oh.. Spiders by Queen Sendaii's zone in are good exp too.. Don't summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">07-09-2007, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jewel of Atiiki is great exp, and you can get some new loot. Stuff hits very hard and fast here, so don't get near them. Your biggest problem will be warping. Any time you move above or below what you have aggroed you risk it warping on you. The best way to stay alive is to root rot and try to stay on even ground. Keep things rooted as much as possible. The exception to this is if you fight in between the pyramids in the north, or around the puzzle area to the west and kill efreeti. You can stay on flat ground and have plenty of room to kite. The enthrallers are the most annoying, they dispell you and themselves (so watch snare), tash, and buff others. Be careful about lords, they hit the hardest and fastest, espcially if an enthraller cast haste on them.<br />
 <br />
If you kill the dervishes, scorpions, and bugs around and just north of the cragbeast pit you can get a named called Rockstorm to spawn. He does not summon, is snareable, and drops a slot 7 and 8 aug with 90 mana, 10 int and wis, 15 cold and magic resist, and 3 mana regen called Right Eye of Ateleka (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=66609). This is his rare drop. Took me 10 kills to get him to drop the aug, but he spawns fairly frequently.<br />
 <br />
If you kill efreeti keep an eye out for Hand of (Insert sphinx name here). Also do not summon and are snareable. They can drop a decent belt called Sandy Worn Sash (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=66596). This is their rare drop. Took me about 5 kills to get the belt.<br />
 <br />
If you would like to do the quest for Efreeti Death Visage (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=67317) be sure to save a scorpion stinger from a scorpion, and any platinum efreeti gear that drops. You need 1 full set (you only need 1 wirst piece for a set). These do not go away when you finish the quest, and can give us a plate look. Also one of the annoying parts is the beginning when you have to hail all the sphinx in the top/bottoms of the pyramids. Easiest way to do this is to use a stalking probe or have a wiz/mage friend use their eye. You can sit at the entrance and use the eye to target the sphinx. You can hail from there. /Assist and hail also works if someone else has it targeted.<br />
 <br />
If you are careful you can go after Glutakan, a named holgresh in the plateau above the zone in, same place the gorilla are. He is a semi rare named, and the hard part about him is finding a place to kill. It's very easy to get adds. He drops Cursed Efreeti Bones (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=67560). It's his only real loot drop, so far he has it every time. He is a heavy caster, and he loves his dispells. Be ready to re-snare/root a lot, and try to keep junk buffs on yourself.<br />
 <br />
There is a 90 hp/end, 10 sta and str, 15 disease and poison resist, and 3 regen aug called Polished Fire Coral (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=56801) in Thallasius that is easy to get too. Drops from a regura named called Rockcrusher. Easiest way for him is to kill things around the towers in the corners of the zone until he spawns. Make sure you run around and check track before you start killing as he is often already up somewhere. Watch out for hraquis, they summon.</div></div><hr />
