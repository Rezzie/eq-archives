<br />
It only took about 30 of them to get to ally.<br />
<br />
The reason it is such a good quest to do is that you need to kill 4 different mobs and loot their corpses, but each drops 6 of the quest bits (one for each person, if grouped).  <br />
<br />
However, when done solo, you can finish the quest, request it again, go back to the 4 mobs (which respawn when you get close) and loot their OLD corpses for updates. <br />
<br />
If everything went perfect, I was able to do the quest once normally and then 2 more times without killing the mobs again, which made it go quite fast.<br />
<br />
Give it a try, it is really a quest designed for druids, especially since 3 of the mobs are one one side of the mountain range and one is on the other (we can egress to 3 and use the LP port for the 4th to save alot of running).<br />

<br />
Mine were split between the kill 20 goblins, loot/plant 3 insignia and Daring Rescue quests.<br />
<br />
They weren't amazingly fun - nothing new or innovative, although the planting of the insignia made for a challenge, in seeing if I could avoid agro completly on all 3 (only pulled it off once).  <br />
<br />
I did Daring Rescue a lot solo because the mob I was killing gave a Fangbreakers faction hit in addition to the quest reward faction - but it doesn't seem to have been a big hit at all.<br />
<br />
All up I spent about 15 hours solo to get to Kindly, sounds like I could have done it faster.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I found that Brom's head will appear on cursor simply when the proper skull is destroyed.  What this means is you can destroy skulls from a distance and get the update without aggroing the mobs standing nearby.  Just a lil trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annabella</div><div class="date">12-30-2007, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Supplementing Cloudia's posts:<br />
 <br />
The Lost Necklace task (killing vampires - any, not just reavers, in the 'crypt' tunnels near HoS zoneline in LP, and returning a necklace drop) is given by Mengryl, a high elf standing on the grass by the refugee camp / docks.<br />
 <br />
It is fairly easy other than for ridiculous pathing and mobs that warp to random parts of the zone as soon as you aggro them if they are in certain rooms (even though it should be pretty obvious to the mob there's only one way out, they just run at a wall and warp instead).<br />
 <br />
The faction hits seem lighter than for the Lost Elves task. I did Lost Elves 25x taking me from Dubious to Kindly and able to purchase SotF2. I then did 19x Lost Necklace and only just left Kindly and started to make progress on Warmly now at somewhere between tasks 15-19 (making it at least 15 tasks to get through Kindly, which rivals how many tasks it took me to get through Amiably, so that's not right unless the faction hit is a lot lower).<br />
 <br />
If you get lucky on necklace drops, it may still be the faster faction route if you're alone and can get the 6 task faction hits inside of 20-25 mins. Drop rate can seem to 'dry up' (RNG) for 10+ vampires sometimes though, which means with funky pulling/warping, you can sometimes end up going a couple of hours without a faction hit at all. If nothing else, it allows for some variation though.<br />
 <br />
Edit: Also worthy of note is the exp for Lost Necklace - each turn in yields 10% AA @ 80, so on a lucky streak you can get yourself some reasonably good exp on top of the kills by netting another 60% of an AA on the necklace turn-ins (if you're getting all 6 solo, obviously less if you're sharing/grouping).</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 Thanx,<br />
 <br />
 Philio <br />
  i would like to point out, saying we can succor to 3 mobs is incorrect. one mob is south of the druid rings by the minotaur cave, one mob is west of the fangbreaker camp near the shadowmanes, one is on the south part of the zone by the docks where the boat goes to dragonscale hills, and the final mob is close to the were-orc camp on the way to hills of shade, past the roaming worgs and near the cave.<br />
<br />
 it isnt as hard as it sounds tho, since we can use the loping port for one mob, bind at the docks for a second, run north to a third, and the last is close enough to the evac pt to just run. with practice u can :<br />
<br />
  run to the shadowmane corpse, gate to the docks corpse, run north to the were-orc camp corpse, then use loping plains port for the last. getting 3 complete tasks per each kill was easy if done right.<br />
<br />
<br />
  with absolutely no previous faction work, and following this table which is pretty much the accepted faction ranges, it took me exactly 40 tasks and 6 hours of my time to reach ally:<br />
<br />
-2000 to -751, scowls <br />
-750 to -501, threateningly <br />
-500 to -101, dubious <br />
-100 to -1, apprehensive <br />
0 to 99, indifferent <br />
100-499, amiably <br />
500-749, kindly <br />
750-1099, warmly <br />
1100+, allied <br />
<br />
  (pushes nerd glasses up nose) <br />
<br />
    i pretty much calculated each lost elf task is worth around 40  faction points. heres what i conned after certain tasks:<br />
<br />
  task 8 : dubious<br />
<br />
  task 9 : dubious<br />
<br />
  task 11 : apprehensive<br />
<br />
  task 15 : amiable<br />
<br />
  task 25 : kindly<br />
<br />
  task 30 : kindly<br />
 <br />
  task 32 : warmly<br />
<br />
  task 39 : warmly<br />
<br />
  task 40 : ally<br />
<br />
  so, if we start at max negative dubious with -500, and im pretty sure we do, since 9 tasks still left me at dubious and 15 put me at amiable. <br />
<br />
   10 tasks at 40 points per task would have put me at -100, apprehensive, which fits what i /con the merchant so far.<br />
<br />
   5 more tasks is worth 200 points, putting me at 100, which is the bare minimum for amiable (4 wouldnt have done it) and again fitting my faction progression.<br />
<br />
  10 more tasks put me at 25th time having done the task, puts me at 500, at kindly, and again fits what was said about 25 tasks needed for kindly and SoTf rk 2 ( 24 would not have been enough)<br />
<br />
  5 more tasks, putting me at task number 30 and 700 faction points, would still keep me at kindly, which it did, but task 32, put me at 780 points should have put me at warmly, and it did.<br />
<br />
  so by task 40 it reached 1100, and if the chart and my number is correct, or at least close, i should be ally now, and i was<br />
<br />
  (takes off nerd glasses)<br />
<br />
  my numbers may be a little off, as i dont recall having done any faction work, but i may have killed some mobs somewhere somehow for a small amount of fangbreaker faction. <br />
<br />
  in any case im pretty sure i have never done much previous fangbreaker faction, if any, so if absolutely no faction has been done for fangbreakers at all it should be within one task of 40 lost elf tasks (39 - 41) to get ally.<br />
<br />
 all in all, in return for 6 hours of my time, i gained one full aa point every 3 tasks done at lvl 78, plus some decent xp per kill, for a grand total of 14 aa's in 6 hours work, in addition to raising my fangbreaker faction to ally. worth a 6 hour investment in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mob resists root, charges me, I back off and try root again, resisted, try again, sticks, snare mob, chanter slows mob, root breaks, mob smacks me for 5 seconds, dead.<br />
<br />
Mob hits like a freight train, even when slowed, runs really fast, even when snared.  Ground around the mob has tons of little hills, so half the time, you get the can not cast on the mob message, mobs roam around and one walked up and killed the chanter after I died.<br />
<br />
I had 16k HP, 1000 AAs and am lvl 79 and I gave up.  Either this was nerfed or you guys live in a different universe than I do.  Or maybe I just really suck.<br />
<br />
All I know is that I'm not going back to try it again without a major tank.  From my viewpoint, this quest really sucks.  It looks like I'll have Survival of the Fittest about 2012, just in time for EQ to be shut down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had trouble with the one up near HoS zone though, hes surrounded by undead mobs and its hard to single pull him.<br />
<br />
That said I never did any lost elves tasks anyway, I factioned my way up doing the worg slaughter.</div></div><hr />

I always always snare first.  entrap 2 works fine, or serpant vines works too.  Root resists/breaks often.  Snare resists exceptionally rarely.  Just stand back, snare, then move it to where u want and root.  Or don't, i usually just let it follow me around and let my dots eat it away.  Plus that lets me use NBW and our new nuke AA without worrying about re-rooting after every cast.<br />
<br />
I did lost elves probably 20 times or so total.  I could go through 4 missions solo before the first corpse rotted, then still get the other 3 loots before restarting killing so long as I didn't do anything stupid.  Made the faction fly.  Never once had anything resist serpant vines.<br />
<br />
The hardest is Wendia.  I pulled her along the canyon wall there...the orcs don't assist her.  The worgs do tho, so u have to be careful.  But if one wandered by, I'd just snare it and let it follow me around too.  Once she died I was porting to the druid ring anyway so lost aggro.</div></div><hr />

Not much to see than what Sorkin covers way more succinctly above really, but you can see for yourself.<br />
 <br />
This isn't meant to be an impressive display of EQ playing! It's a pretty basic (and boring, even,) snare-pull / root-rot using my default fire soloing lineup, and I wasn't paying too much attention (hence forgetting my dodge mod familiar until the fight was over half way through and it taking 5 mins to do).<br />
 <br />
I've just been in the habit of doing vid recording and editing lately so I figured what the hell - it's a 65MB download though (go go overkill and no clipping/transitions) so I still have a lot to learn to maximise efficiency of clipping and frame dropping, the size shouldn't be prohibitive though for most any broadband connection these days.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Things worth noting in a mini post-analysis of the fight..<br />
 <br />
- It's easy enough to get the update whilst remaining safely invis, even if the mob (which sees invis) has already been up and triggered by someone else.  This applies to all of them except the one nearest druid rings (by mino caves) where you near enough have to be on top of the damn thing and I suggest getting that one by doing 'fly bys' without pausing to minimise damage taken.<br />
 <br />
- You should have no problem with solo pulls on all of them except the one nearest Hills of Shade, which is a bit of a pain to single out without adds if you want to create some room, so I suggest killing that one first, so that you can minimise the time required to kill all four (which means the corpses will be around for longer allowing you to sweep through the quest a 2nd and 3rd time without having to kill the mobs, just loot the old corpses again after getting the 'found elf' update).<br />
 <br />
- If you're having difficulties, it's probably not down to lack of gear/spells particularly (i.e. mana/hp/etc. shouldn't be much of an issue and it could be done with a lot less than I have at Solteris raiding level)..<br />
 <br />
- I would suggest (if you don't already have them) that the anti-break root AAs are beneficial, using either the 2nd rank clicky snare or Serpents to do the initial pulls with, and spell haste (worn / cleric) are going to help mostly.  I haven't gone over your profile so don't know if you already have these things in hand, it's just my observation of what probably helps make this fight easier/trivial on the safety scale than if you didn't have such things.<br />
 <br />
- I took a few &quot;flesh wounds&quot; in this fight but that was more out of laziness than anything else, they probably could have all been avoided, but primarily due to spell haste and root casting speed - maybe alternatively, you can keep Vineclash handy instead if you're finding it tight on casting time.<br />
 <br />
- The place I dragged the mob too is relatively safe from roamers along the edge there, and another 2 of the elves are safer still.  The tricky one is Wendia by the vamp caves / HoS zone, but I usually just put in a little extra pull/kite time on that one and steer it around the other side of the road leading to HoS where there's a mob-free area to play/practice in.<br />
 <br />
- I laboured a bit on using the mouse to demonstrate what spells I wanted to cast and when, though I'm a keyboard shortcut freak mostly, but just to emphasise that there's nothing really about this that relies on tricks or anything, I'm sure it's just because it's new to you and prone to mistakes you wouldn't make once you're familiar with the terrain.  Hope it encourages you to try again.  Good luck!<br />

This applies to all of them except the one nearest druid rings (by mino caves) where you near enough have to be on top of the damn thing and I suggest getting that one by doing 'fly bys' without pausing to minimise damage taken.<br />

Nice video anna. just a couple things id like to add tho :<br />
 <br />
Mobs don't actually see invis, they are undead mobs and are thus un-affected by a regular invis spell. you need Invis vs undead.<br />
 <br />
Its much safer to use philter of unlife awareness(commonly made by alchemists, and occasionally sold in bazaar) to breeze past the update spot next to the Duid rings to get the task update. especially if playing a non-raid geared druid. <br />
 <br />
these things hit pretty hard (they can quad hit up to 2k) and you will most likely draw agro getting the update without some form of invis vs undead active on you, and the last thing you want is an un-snared shade chasing you running at full bore.<br />
 <br />
none of the shades see invis vs undead, so if you have the philter of unlife awareness or can box a toon with invis vs undead spell you can stand on top of the druid rings mob update spot with absolutely no risk and get the update..then snare them at your Liesure.</div></div><hr />

Bards still don't get invis to undead so never bothered to check that.</div></div><hr />

Then, since he was the last one for me, I just egressed back to the camp.  If he wasn't up, then I was able to get the update and back away without aggro if I was really quick.  The IVU potion is a good idea though that I didn't think of.   The rest are very easy to get updates without aggro and without burning an IVU potion though.</div></div><hr />
