<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd been grouping and trying for a Tornado Stone for about a month in BoT.  Pain in the ass to get my hands on as no one on my server ever camps the &quot;North&quot; Giants.<br />
<br />
So one day I logged in pre-raid and said...  Let me go camp what I can and see what I can do, exodus is up!<br />
<br />
A Vind Vill - Druid mob - Easy pickins<br />
A Vind Prest - Didn't try one<br />
A Vind Militis - Hardest hitter so you need lots of hp and stay away from him.<br />
A Vind Geistlig - I got the one of these I tried to 16 percent before evacing after he CH'd himself.  Just don't have the manapool to burn him down twice.<br />
<br />
I was running about 6500hp 9+kazads and 6k mana when I attempted this.  It's not very efficient, fortunately I got a Tornado Sphere and have completed a BoT tower key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Err.. Mobs there don't summon? or you talking about soloing summoners?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Woodix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They summon )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CountessKrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone who solos summoners (especially ones that hit for 500+) is a complete and utter idiot. No real need to expand on that as everyone knows that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alyn Cross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but it's fun!<br />
<br />
my favorite at the moment, personally, is ocean giants in pos!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aenara Wyldhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's definitely insane... wish I had Iegil's HPs and Mana Pool!<br />
<br />
On Prexus, BoT is pretty campered. Can usually just beg groups to let you loot key parts since they lots of people tend to have them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh ... I'll respond with another quote:<br />
<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;<br />
Theodore Roosevelt, 1910<br />
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face in marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.<br />

<br />
Hmmm<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno i solo summoners ..including the ones in BoT all the time.   Im not an idiot ..im just better than you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are published guides to soloing summoners.  It's called slam kiting if anyone is interested enough to do a search.<br />
<br />
On another note, melee giants are the only ones who summon in BoT (Militas, named and some other one that I can't remember).  Caster mobs and elementals won't summon although if you're not experienced with dealing with caster mobs, they will gate on you then train you with their friends.</div></div><hr />
