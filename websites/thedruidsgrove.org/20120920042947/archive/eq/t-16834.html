<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swany</div><div class="date">09-27-2008, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so i've been leveling a druid for the past week to box with my Beastlord. This will be mainly for heals and added DPS and of course snares. I'm sure you all are better and knows what works well with a druid so i'm basically just looking for advice on what would be a good direction to go starting out with AA's. Just some suggestions maybe of what to get first or a list of the important ones that would better suit me for that type of situation.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

I run Hillary with a wide variety of other classes (SK, Monk, Ranger, Shaman, Cleric, Mage, Enc, Wiz, Bard, NEC) and if I had it to do over again, the path I would've taken would've been:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Metabolism 3<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3 (she's an Alteration spec)<br />
Mnemonic Retention 1<br />
Innate Camo<br />
Entrap<br />
Spirit of the Wood 1<br />
Enhanced Root (for obvious reasons)<br />
Healing Adept 3<br />
Healing Gift 3<br />
Call of the Wild (cheaper than EEs)<br />
Shared Camouflage<br />
<br />
...then I'd move into situational skills, depending on what's needed at the time. Usually, Hill's not counted on for DPS so her support and utility are of greater importance in my groups. I would suggest you go with the skills that best complement your beastlord.</div></div><hr />
