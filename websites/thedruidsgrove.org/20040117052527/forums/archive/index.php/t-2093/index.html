<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stewwy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well a simple all encompassing question really......<br />
<br />
Anyone have a good tactic for killing the Behemoth in the factory they would like to share?  Would greatly appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, I hate this fight. It's the biggest, ugliest, most annoying zerg fight that was ever invented in eq. On top of that, the factory is easily accessible by anyone that isn't on your raid. So, if your server is anything like mine, you'll get trained and begged and followed by all kinds of people looking to mooch a flag.  Stating that, here's some info on the fight itself posted on some other board:<br />
<br />
everquest.allakhazam.com/...1;t=017499 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ubbnew/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=1;t=017499)<br />
<br />
How we do it:<br />
<br />
We assign groups to each of the 4 corners prior to the fight. Nobody starts to kill spiders until we give the order. A SoS rogue stands in front of the behemoth room to call to the raid when he becomes targetable.<br />
<br />
Once your raid is ready to go, each corner kills all the spiders that come their way until MB is targetable. This could take about 5-10 minutes. From there, the raid finishes up with the current spider it's killing and enchanters mez and memblur everything else. Then we have a DA paly, WS ranger - whatever rush in to MB and move him to a corner. MT follows.  We've used both a warrior and a sk for this fight. I'm convinced the sk does better because they can hold agro better but not everyone that leads our raids agrees with me so we've switched back and forth and have won with both. <br />
<br />
Anyway, once your mt gets agro send everyone else in. We leave 1-2 enchanters in each corner, depending on how many enchanters there are. Caution your casters to hold out a bit so they don't cause ping pong but by 30% they should be unloading their mana pool.<br />
<br />
There's really no way to avoid the aoe gflux/knockback because it's an outdoor zone, but healers can stay out of the silence. If you're lucky, MB won't get that silence off at all.<br />
<br />
Once he's dead, have a fd class aggro the gnome and move him out into the hallway so the raid can hail. Have your enchanters memblur, die or camp to clear spider aggro. Set up cr with people calling out when spiders are about to enter the room and make sure everyone gets out before they do.<br />
<br />
And like I said, expect to be trained by unwanted guests on your raid. We've been trained, wiped out, plooted etc and even had the gnome killed on 1 occassion by some jerk who didn't take no for an answer. We've learned to have gm's physically remove unwanted tagalongs from the zone when we do this raid.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe Behemoth is kinda fun fight. Make  4 balanced groups (dsp, tank, slower, healer) and put them in each corner to block spiders from entering where Behemoth is.  Then have the rest of the raid waiting by Behemoth door and MT stay righr beisde  Behemoth. Keep kiling spiders till Behemoth becomes targetable then just zerg him down. Very fast fight and little healing is required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AE heal over time spells are helpful.  It also helps to have a bard ready to sing either AE fire/cold resists OR AE poison/disease resists...the third AE besides the magic-based knockback and the unresistable silence is one of four things.  It's a 900/tick for 3 ticks dot that can check fire, cold, poison, or disease, but stays consistent throughout the fight.  It's a proc so it goes off often and irregularly; it has a small range but does a lot of damage.  Since it has a -150 modifier, it's relatively easy to resist (compared to the -300 on the timed AE knockback).  A couple of them are slightly different; the fire one has a small knockback component to it, and the disease one is actually a targetted AE, so you need to base your distance from the tank rather than MB.</div></div><hr />
