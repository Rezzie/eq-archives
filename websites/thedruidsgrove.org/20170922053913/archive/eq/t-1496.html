<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broomhilda</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm curious if you think this is a fair comparison to gauge whether caster balancing has worked or not.  Obviously, a rogue is the best damage a melee can output, excluding maybe 60 monks from what people say, altho i swear it seems like rogues can still out dps anybody by a large margin from my experiences.  The improvement in how fast a mob goes down in experiences where my groups have added a rogue have always been much more noticeable than adding any other class by far.  I dont know what the numbers say, and again i know people say a 60 monk can match a rogues dps but i'm somewhat skeptical.  To me rogues are the Gods of dps by a large margin, i notice it everytime a rogue is in my group, more than adding any other class.<br />
<br />
Then we have Wizards.  The best damage a caster can output.  From my experiences with grouping with Wizards, they can in no way come close to the dps of the rogue on a consistent basis.  The reason being is unless a Wizard has the benefit of multiple mana regens, his mana limits his dps.  In exp groups, they generally have 1 mana regen like either kei or bard song or c2, excluding whatever self mana regen spells they have.  Rarely 2 of those in any given exp group situation.  I happen to think choosing a Wizard in exp groups is very similar to choosing a Druid.  Melee simply are better choices.  A rogue in my eyes is better than a wizard because hes not limited by his mana pull.  In a similar manner a Pally may be better than a Druid.  It doesnt take mana for a pally to maintain his dps for the most part.  Again, none of us are getting the benefit of multiple mana regens we may be getting at a raid, like mod rods, kei, etc.<br />
<br />
So lets say hypothetically if Verant said tomorrow Caster Balancing was finished and implemented.  Would it be fair to compare the damage of a wizzy vs the damage of a rogue and expect them to be similar in dps?  Does anybody know where their currently at in comparison?<br />
<br />
I dont have any facts or figures.  I can only talk about what i've seen, and what i believe to be true from personal experiences.  I may not like Wizards too much since they,out of any class seem to have things against Druids.  Outside of all that, i believe Wizards can use some general upgrades, and lack for desirability in exp groups in the same manner we do.  Mainly because when a group wants to fill that dps role, its usually not a wizzy but a rogue.  From my experiences, i've never seen a wizzy able to keep their damage on par with a rogue.  I've even see high lvl wizzies get out dps'd by mid 50's rogues.  How you may ask?  From what i've seen, its mainly due to mana.  A rogue can go non-stop, when a Wizzy with only lets say C2 has to sit quite abit.  I was recently in an exp groups with a 55 rogue and a 58 Wizard.  The Rogue was a way better dps class than the Wizzy.  The Wizard didnt even come close in terms of dps on a consistent basis.  After seeing this pretty often, i feel picking a rogue to fill out a dps role in exp groups is hands down better than taking any Wizzy everytime.<br />
<br />
I see that as a obvious imbalance in terms of caster vs melee.  The best melee dps class vs the best caster dps class.  Of course there are other factors involved, like their other abilities, but i'd even go so far as to say a rogue has more.  So my question is, is this a fair outlook?  Is it fair to gauge caster balance being successful or not, by comparing Rogues vs Wizards?  Thats my question.</div></div><hr />

That's not always the case, but in every fight we've parsed our rogues have outdamaged our monks by about 15dps.<br />
<br />
As far as upgrading wizards go...well this will piss a lot of wiz's off but I don't think they need anymore upgrades beyond their manaburn. (it's the same CH, port, sow, etc argument we've seen over and over) Mana isn't the only limiting factor for wizards.  With ft15, kei, self mana regen, potg and mental clarity, mana shouldn't be that big of a deal. They have to deal with agro management. They could far outdamage a rogue if they could chain nuke and drop agro with an evade skill like rogues.<br />
<br />
Anyway, is it fair to compare rogues to wizards for balancing? I'd say yeah, but would also say that they're pretty close dmg wise already. The problem is that once all this balancing is done, vi will have to upgrade mobs again as they'll all be to easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...that is the kind of thinking I worry about a little.  I worry Verant thinks about it this way too.<br />
<br />
There are broadly speaking two very different problems going on at the same time.  1) Casters don't get the same benefit from new gear and equipment that tanks do (this is the big raid guild problem).  This is what the Ancient spells and some of the higher, harder to get Focus Items are for. 2) Casters are not in balances with melee overall in the game (and not in balance with each other).  This second is a problem that affects most caster classes at most levels (certainly post 50).<br />
<br />
If we approach the second problem assuming that everyone has FT15, KEI, all levels of mental clarity, etc then we will not really be balancing casters.  We will be tuning the casters in about one or two guilds per server.  I think that perhaps 3 to 5 druids on my server have FT15.  I am certainly not one of them.<br />
<br />
Admitedly any changes made to balance casters must take into consideration the theoretical maximum benefits, but I really don't think that the appropriate platform for caster balancing should start with the maximum equipped character profiles.  They have to look more at Joe Average, but be careful not to improve things for casters in such a way that the best equipped casters in the game become overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But my problem with that Seriena is your comparing a very polished Wizzy to an average rogue.  Most Wizzy's dont have that type of mana regen in most situations, especially in your average groups.  Only on raids will 'average' Wizzies get that type of mana regen through the use of mod rods, kei, manasong, necro dumping, etc.   I'd say for most Wizzies, they only have 1 mana regen benefit(kei/c2 or manasong) in most groups.  Meanwhile, a rogue doesnt need that type of maintenance, all he needs is another class that can hold aggro for them to backstab which usually isnt too much of a problem.<br />
<br />
I agree, i think Manaburn is an extreme ability that makes them very special and wanted in the high end game.  My problem with this has to do with comparing them to say a cleric.  A cleric is extremely wanted for CH in the same manner, but clerics also have a much easier time getting exp groups in a general sense(despite what they say).  Again, i can factor in AoE groups to makeup for their lack of desirability in exp groups, but i just dont think AoE groups are as commonplace so i cant give it too much weight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broomhilda</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Oldoaktree, and your right its that same issue we have with the druids that have the same setup that are looked at as the 'norm'.  The thing that bothers me the most is the disparity is so large when it comes to having ft15, etc, etc. when the lvls can be identical.  <br />
<br />
Something that always rings in my mind everytime i get into this type of discussion between the 'uber' and the 'average', is reading the posts from ft15 Druids that talk about never having to sit to med.  I specifically remember posts from a few 'priveleged' druids talking about how they can quad endlessly on a horse without the need to sit.  I just find that amazing, compared to what i have to do while quading.  When you hear other druids say they have more mana than they know what to do with, it crosses your mind there is a BIG difference between that 60 Druid and myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a general matter, I believe it is appropriate for the best melee damage-dealer to be held up to the best magic damage-dealer.  In terms of SUSTAINED damage.   Comparable level, and comparable equipment at a number of different levels (of both).<br />
<br />
From each of those, the damage and abilities of the other classes in the appropriate category can be assessed.  Druids should be about 2/3 the damage dealers that wizards are, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you have a point there. Thinking about one of my wizzy friends...I don't consider him uber - pretty avg by standards, has coldain shawl, ft3 boots, solstice earring, mana burn. I imagine he has atleast mc1. When we're together he has kei and potg so that would be 2 (shawl) + 3(boots) + 1 (earring) + 1(mc1) + 14 (kei) + 6 (potg) = 27 mana / tick. That's pretty decent imo and obtainable by just about anyone (except maybe the boots for druids ;p ).<br />
<br />
When I was thinking of our rogues, they're pretty polished too with aa skills, but their weapons and buffs aren't exceptional so when you strip the 2 down (rogue and wiz) I'd still say they're fairly equal. I think the biggest factor is agro control. A dead wiz won't stack up to rogue dmg ;p<br />
<br />
Either way, I'd be interested in seeing some parsing on wiz vs rogue dmg. We parse our melee but not our casters so I have no idea where our casters should be sitting at.<br />
<br />
Btw, I think that times are changing for wizards in exp groups. The way I see it these days is a wizard is wanted in groups over all dmg casters (druids, mages, necros) and sometimes even over certain melee classes. Not to mention the lists of ae groups. We regularly replace group members for our wiz friends in ct, even when my druid is sitting outside of the group and could easily take the 6th spot for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverblade the Enchanter</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm, wizards are pretty poor at DPs, in standard xp groups, no matter their gear, as long as they are equal in status to their comrades.<br />
<br />
The prime purpose of a wizard originally was to blast mobs dead there and THEN. Which they did, Ice Comet on a LGuk frog is pretty damn severe.<br />
<br />
but take it a few eras on..a typical FG shroom has about 8,000 hp. Ice Comet..eh, that wil hurt but not maim...hm Garrisons! Thats a bit better..but it sucks for mana ratio and its rarer than hell.<br />
See the problem?<br />
When a wiz starts blasting mobs die fast, but not as fast as they should. Nukes really havent been seriously improved since Kunark, which is a joke when mobs hit points have rocketted. <br />
<br />
If you want high DPs in an xp group, get a mage.<br />
If you want fast kills of tough mobs on a raid, get a wizard.<br />
If you want mega damage over time on an uber mob, get a necro.<br />
<br />
Epic mage with boots of bladecalling does around 100+ DPs in an xp group continously, without using mana.<br />
Of course GETTING those 2 items is extremely hard. If you think that's unfair in comparison to druid DPs, ask around and see how many epic mages with BoB are on your server, I'd guess around 2-8.<br />
Mages have the highest DPs in non AoE groups of the caster classes, the time scale, and level of mobs is dieal for mages (spells resist more than wizards, pets levels are lower than players so best on lower lvl targets, the time factors make 30 second-type xp fights very good, pets are incredibly mana efficient DoTs)<br />
This is paid for by having very little crowd control or survival abilities.<br />
<br />
Wizards really shine on raids when you can have several all turn on one mob and vape it out of its boots. You need mobs dead as fast as possible on raids, they tend ot have extreme hit points and damage out put. 10 wizards can turn round and dumb 30k damage into that 50k hp mob pretty damn fast. there's a disaprity between wizard's damage in raids and xp settings that's a prime glitch in EQ :/<br />

An 'average' 60 wizard will pump out maybe 25 DPS of sustained damage. A wizard with everything you can have (FT, focus, buffs, AA etc) will get around 60 DPS, then add unlimited mana in the form of mod rods and it gets to somewhere around 80-90DPS.<br />
This is somewhere around Bard, SK, Pal sustained damage and nowhere near rogues.</div></div><hr />

  This brings out something that was missed previously.  Clicky nukes.  While wizards lack the free damage of pets magicians bring, they have better clicky nukes for manaless damage that they can suplament with ice spear which does about 33% more damage for the mana than mage nukes.  So wizards still lag far behind magicians for sustained DPS in groups with little to no downtime, they are head and shoulders above druids who lack clicky nukes other than the Vex Thal one and, lets admit it, as much as we love booboo, we really don't have a pet.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Mages have the highest DPs in non AoE groups of the caster classes, the time scale, and level of mobs is dieal for mages (spells resist more than wizards, pets levels are lower than players so best on lower lvl targets, the time factors make 30 second-type xp fights very good, pets are incredibly mana efficient DoTs)<br />

 <br />
  I'd be suspicous this is always true.  In groups without manaboost from KEI or bardsong necro's mana regen spells might give them an edge, particularly on non uber equipped magicians who lack FT too.  Necro pets do very nice damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wizards really shine on raids when you can have several all turn on one mob and vape it out of its boots. You need mobs dead as fast as possible on raids, they tend ot have extreme hit points and damage out put. 10 wizards can turn round and dumb 30k damage into that 50k hp mob pretty damn fast. there's a disaprity between wizard's damage in raids and xp settings that's a prime glitch in EQ :/&quot;<br />
 <br />
  On raids wizards (and druids) get KEI, and usually bardsong, and sometimes better canni than canni modrods.  Standing mana regen of 50 or 60/tick minimum + some med and the entirety of a 4500 mana pool to burn away to nothing really lets the damage fly.  For short fights wizard's huge nukes let them shine over druids, many a time I've cursed having efficient but small nukes as a mob gates away on me.  For long fights all nukers come somewhat closer to parity, druids have lower max DPS than wizards but our sustained DPS isnt too far off before factoring in clickys, same with other classes, even clerics aren't THAT far off if they're the weirdo that has specced in evocation.<br />
 <br />
  For groups though manabound classes, wizards, druids and clerics, truely suck.  Clerics though are focused on healing so no one cares if their sustained damage output sucks because they're choking on a lack of mana, don't have free damage from clicky or pet, and don't have KEI and bardsong and focus items which the class is balanced as having.  The amount of haste items in the game that are tradeable go a long way towards upping meleer damage, why there isn't more tradeable FT items like there are tradeable melee haste, and more KEI or even clarity casting items and the occasional cantata of replenishment item and druid clicky nuke I don't know, it would seem to close the gap between being pitiful for groups and killer on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broomhilda</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your last paragraph L1ndara summed up pretty much everything i was trying to say.  I completely agree, FT items should be treated similar to melee haste items.  They both have a profound effect on the users, more than anything.  Sure, the FT3 boots arent too difficult to get altho its permacamped, the potc earring pretty much takes either some money or some serious time, but this is far from what we should have available.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, i completely agree.  Casting classes dont match melee's in average groups, mainly due to the mana regen thats usually available.  People love to post how much damage a class does, but notice those are almost always taken from raids where those casters have all the mana regen they could want.  The dropoff from that to groups is very significant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is kinda like how everyone compares druid nukes using Moonfire.  I know very few druids on my server who have this spell.  It is not the norm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverblade the Enchanter</div><div class="date">07-26-2002, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as amage thats why I preffer, generally, FT items to go to wizards, druids and clerics, because you are directly reliant on PURE mana useage.<br />
<br />
A BIG mistake was caping medding that's SO unfair, it kicks in around lvl 53?? Em so you get bigger mana pools, bigger mana useage...but your natural regen of aman is CAPPED?! WTF silliness is that?<br />
<br />
FT1 or FT2 items should drop of mobs like Gorenaire, VS, Trak, NOT freakin mobs that would chew those monsters for breakfast *sigh*. Look at Trak BP drops, Int casters get the Mana Robe..eh? Why nto put decent stats on it and FT2?<br />
Orb of Tishan of Kunark Dragons...em..excuse me but apart from tashing some mob in desperation WHAT USE IS THAT TO A CASTER?!! *sigh* Give it FT1 instead and it becomes good, compare it to a Cloak of Flames...<br />
<br />
melee get General items (rings and such); weapons and armour.<br />
Casters dont really NEED weapons, look at all the caster wepons with procs ont hem..oh my gawd..CASTERS DONT MELEE! Casters also get general items, armour and spells. Armour is of less use to casters because they generally get hit less and the stats dotn do much for melee combat. So the actual use of armour to a caster is much less than to a melee. 100 hp Hit points on caster gear is much more useful than +20 AC +12 Dex and Str for example.<br />
Caster spelsl also, CANNOT BE TRADED ONCE SCRIBED! Therefore you cannot pass on spells like you can do with BP and haste items.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, there are 4 mage right click nukes in game: Boots of BLadecalling (from Velketor, very bloody rare); Sceptre from Rhaag2 (unsure of rarity); Burnt Wood Staff from chardok (I have never seen one of them drop in all my time playing, extremely freakin rare); Iceshatter from Itrear Vius (thats useable by all int casters and generally I'd rather it went to a chanter of necro even though mages dont have any cold nukes). Four items are not a lot, especially considering their rarity.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you what IS strange though about right clicks: Chardok, an evac staff drops for druids and wizards..EH?!?!?<br />
WTF is that not a right click nuke sceptre?!? Now THAT'S not fair.<br />
