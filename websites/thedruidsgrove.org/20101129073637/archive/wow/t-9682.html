You have to choose between two clans of centaurs to attack, the Gelkis or the Magram.<br />
Is their any diffenrence between the two? Which is the best to attack?<br />

If I remember right, some of the undead mobs in another part of the zone are on Magram faction and KOS, even if you're friendly to other Magram.<br />
<br />
Kind of a hassle to work the faction up and then lose it due to KOS mobs. :P</div></div><hr />

If you are into grinding a lot, then go for it.  I lvld up from 30-40 really quick with my priest alt by doing all the SS quests, all of the non-elite arathi quests, and all the desolace quests (except for the two you mentioned).  If you really want to grind something, I would recommend grinding in Scarlet Monestary.  There is good xp there, and you get lots more drops.  Only drawback is that you need a group.  At lv 33, there are still a lot of good quests to do in Southshore while waiting / looking for a PuG for SM.  <br />
<br />
But if you want to do the deso faction quests, I'd recommend killing Magram.</div></div><hr />

It can take some time to complete, so I prefer to be closer to my village in case of dirty alliance gankers.<br />
<br />
When I do the quest on Alliance, I will likely reverse the two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My logic at the time was that the Gelkis were close to a road or zone, and being friendly with made travelling around easier.<br />
<br />
Also, as someone else mentioned above, there are other mobs in the zone on Magram faction (and I seem to remember there being a quest to kill them), so there's more ways of getting that faction.<br />
