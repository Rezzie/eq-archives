Outland is very nice for Balance druids. There's some really nice stuff out there. Avoid cloth when you can. ;)</div></div><hr />

I noticed you didn't have one now. A staff is better than a one-hand weapon with no offhand. And the crystalfire staff is very nice; I used that one until I got the battlemage staff from Ring of Blood.</div></div><hr />
