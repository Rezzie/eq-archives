Hi, I am Senator Barack Obama and I am running for President, offer not available in stores, vote tuesday. In addition to voting  me as the president you will receive as a bonus...... lol. Not a bad idea though with his presidential marketing scheme, from video games like Madden, grand theft auto( I could almost picture that one now, a billboard in game threatening to cut down the crime rate), and primetime on major networks with analog television(going to miss that) still being used.</div></div><hr />

From what I saw it was vignettes of people who are having trouble &quot;getting by&quot; and then he steps in and narrates what he would do to help folks like them.  So it gives him an opportunity to talk about the stuff he's good at talking about, tax cuts to the middle class, health care, creating jobs with that calm, intelligent self-assured manner he has.<br />

I probably would've gotten misty eyed if I had watched more. :)  God, having someone educated and intelligent in office, gives me chills (the good kind).<br />

From what I saw, it was very well done.<br />
Once again, it doesn't pay to underestimate this man. Instead of boring us to tears, Obama has managed to bring us to tears with a combination of heartstring-plucking stories, presidential poise and a good old-fashioned pep rally. And he doesn't even have to mention McCain or Palin, or even Bush, let alone attack them. The tone here is inspirational, after all: Americans are hurting, yes, but they're coming together to decide that the time for change has come.</div></div><hr />
