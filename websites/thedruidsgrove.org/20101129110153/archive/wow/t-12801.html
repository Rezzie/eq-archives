I thought this might make a fun and also informative thread for resto druids of different raiding levels to compare stats and gear, as well as just a way of giving a druid of any level an idea of what to aim for. <br />
<br />
Feel free to discuss why you gear or gem a certain way.<br />
<br />
BTW The stats posted should be unbuffed.<br />

just started Kara, had a lucky drop of the mace from the prince taking me to a grand total of 1282+ Healing, plus purple shoulders and cloak from Red Riding hood, everything else still trash blues and, dare I say it, greens.</div></div><hr />

I have +1400 healing in my feral healing kit.  I have some nice healing purples from kara that no one ever seem to need.  The leftovers have been good to me.</div></div><hr />

Ya...what he said. :thumbsup:<br />

I'm running around as a Moonkin at the moment - doing dailies - in my healing set.  So, I'd post my stats if they weren't so ridiculous looking....*giggle*.  <br />
<br />
But hey, it cut's my daily time in half, so whadayado?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been busy since the last post, now just shy of 1400 healing unbuffed thanks to finally grinding the rep for my prayer books and a nice purple cloth kilt dropping last night in Steam Vaults.<br />
<br />
Happy tank healing in Kara but got dragged in as an emergency stop gap into ZA on saturday and I'm still a way off being ready for there.<br />
<br />
been very Jammy for loot in Kara so far.<br />
<br />

If you're tank healing I guess it's to be expected you're running HoTs on the guys guaranteed to be hit during the run :D<br />
We tried running Kara with 2 healers when my Mace dropped and I was only at around 1000 healing and the priest on 1700 and it was definitely a struggle when anything went wrong. With three healers though I think you've got more room to bring in a healer that is technically understrength.<br />
<br />
[edit]Armoury Link (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Hellscream&amp;n=Nothernellie) For those that want to critique. Still short of rep for the head enchant and I haven't had a chance to smile at the guild tailors for spellthread yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-08-2008, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i'm feral but in the healing gear i've collected i've got :<br />
<br />
+1484 healing<br />
7.95% crit<br />
418/159 mp5.<br />
359 spirit<br />
9410 mana<br />
6777 health<br />
<br />
so i guess my HP are the worst part of the set.<br />
<br />
having said that i think i'm currently down to only now using 2 of my 7 Stormrage set :p<br />
<br />
got some nice purples like Pants of Living Growth / Hood of Primal Life / Shoulderpads of Renewed Life.<br />
<br />
then blues like the prayerbook trinket, a moonglade robe, blue rings and boots.  plus the purple gavel of pure light and the windcaller's orb both from rep rewards.</div></div><hr />

When we started 3 was what we needed to get through.  These days we are doing it with just 2 and even then it seems like except for boss fights we are boring the piss out of the healers even while chain pulling.  Really over time your needs for Kara transform with gear and practice.  We only ever take two, but we keep one person who can off heal for the tight fights like Nightbane.  Beyond that, its pretty straight forward.</div></div><hr />

But nearly 1500 heals now.</div></div><hr />

Ya....and oddly enough, you actually need less healers the further you get into Kara.</div></div><hr />
