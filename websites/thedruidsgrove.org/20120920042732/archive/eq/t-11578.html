<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ruodrra</div><div class="date">06-22-2005, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay what am I missing?  seems to me the only difference is that Mask of Hunter is 50 less mana that can only be cast outdoors versus Mask of Stalker is 50 mana more and has no location restriction.<br />
<br />
Unless there is something I am missing -- why would they have two spells so similar at the same level? As I read in another thread someplace, the 3 hour length would cover most dungeon crawls just by using Hunter.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight into SOE's thinking?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Then you have to egress out to recast.</div></div><hr />

So, TPTB had to come up with something that would feel like an upgrade and be worth wanting, at least a little without making it overpowering or something.<br />
<br />
This is from the spell list on this very site. <br />
<br />
60 - Mask of the Hunter           - 100 - Kunark Drop  <br />
60 - Mask of the Stalker          - 150 - Luclin Drop<br />
<br />
I remember being REALLY glad to get Stalker because I could recast after I died on raids, all of which seem to be in indoor zones at that point.</div></div><hr />

Would have probably been much too hard for the developers to just upgrade the Hunter spell than introduce a second one lol</div></div><hr />

In Velious - after many petitions by druids - they introduced the Mask of the Stalker, which works everywhere.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">01-05-2006, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">correct, which made stalker up to 10x as expensive as hunter back in the day, so I just stuck with hunter until I was 65 and could get forest.</div></div><hr />
