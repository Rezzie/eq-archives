It doesn't seem like something that would bring back subscribers, past and future. They had some fairly limited options for the server choices. It shall be interesting to see how long it takes everyone post 70 with 500 alternate abilities to do that content. Especially with the lack of platinum available at the start of the server which will directly effect mercs and stuff. But, it seems if you just want to dink around, It would certainly help with that.</div></div><hr />

To me, it seems like a trial run -- see what people think and how it works out.  I think it's reasonable to offer it, as a new player starting up EQ has an extremely long road to get to 85.  From what I saw even a couple years ago, there just weren't many people playing at lower levels; if you wanted a group, you might try to find another person who had a PL... or have your own PL.<br />
<br />
But even so, it feels like there aren't a lot of new players starting up EQ these days.  I think most of them would be friends or family of current players.</div></div><hr />
