Spare me! Does anyone know if a shrouded rogue can move around freely in Ashengate and/or Frostcrypt CURRENTLY. I know I was able to explore all of Frostcrypt except the maze a while back in shroud rogue form but I seem to recall hearing they nerfed that in a recent patch. I also seem to recall that the shroud never worked adequately in Ashengate.<br />
<br />
Anyone got reliable current info?</div></div><hr />

Sneaking while shrouded to a rogue effectively gives you regular invis and invis to undead at the same time.  You'll be able to move around in areas that have mixed live and undead mobs, but you can't in places where mobs actually see invis.  Shroud of Stealth is required to not be seen by those mobs, and the rogue shroud does NOT give you Shroud of Stealth.<br />
<br />
Ashengate mobs see invis.<br />
<br />
Most of Frostcrypt is merely undead and will not see through IvU.  As a result, they will not see a shrouded rogue sneaking.  The maze area in the north part of the zone is a different story, though.</div></div><hr />
