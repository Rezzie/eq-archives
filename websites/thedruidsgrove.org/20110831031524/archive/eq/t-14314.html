The furthest I got was level 37, and I don't have access to that account anymore (gave my SWG-tied account to a friend.....won't do that again! LOL).<br />
<br />
So I started again.  Because my friends have characters on Seventh Hammer (we used to play on Lanys) I re-created there, but I am having trouble finding quests/walkthroughs/items for me at level 11.<br />
<br />
Everything is geared towards level 60+, which is fine, but could someone point me in the right direction?  I need to upgrade gear, and I don't want to be pl'd or donated to.  I just want to know what to do!<br />
<br />
Thanks :)<br />
