My problem is, I'm just getting bored with my character, I'm a level 20 Night Elf and, I'm really happy with my new spells (cat form ecspecially) but, all the quests are either: a little too hard for me to do, or just plain suck. I know I can do some better quests in a later level, but until then the only thing I can see to do is grind. Is there anything else I can do? What would be a good place to quest? I've asked my guild the same questions but, even with 25 active members at any moment, all they could come with is Westfall, or Dead Mines. And, I've done all but a few westfall quests, and I guess I'll try the Deadmines. Do you have any other ideas for me?:confused:  Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Run Deadmines at least once. Then, either go to Ashenvale, Wetlands, or Duskwood. Or you could do a combo of the three. There should be more than enough quests for those 3 areas. I don't remember what I did at levels 20-30... they went by pretty fast. I quested in Ashenvale myself, and did a little work in Duskwood.<br />
<br />
At around 23-26ish, try Black Fathom Depths (Deeps? I forget, but it's BFD), in Ashenvale. That'll give you something else to do.</div></div><hr />

Lots of quests to do at that level. Run all the instances that you can, DM, BFD and Gnomer, although Gnomer is a b*tch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snorfin</div><div class="date">11-06-2006, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, thank you both. I'm VERY happy that I can now stop grinding. I want to level up so I can better participate in the WG battles.  Its weird, at lvl 19 your pwning everyone, at 20 all you   can do is take insignias. But, once again, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did alot of instances and stoped being bored..<br />
<br />
i would do VC(Deadmines) untill 22 do a few quests in Wetlands or Ashenvale.. to get to lvl 24-25 the get in a ton of grps for BFD(Blackfathom Deeps) untill u feel u have done it enough... then around lvl 28 try to get into Gnomer... untill lvl 32-34 and try to get in SM(Scarlet Monestary) untill 40-42 maybe do some uldaman.. then go to questing...:)</div></div><hr />

What came before level 60? I now have 2 druids stuck at level 60 and they are both fun to play.I still prefer Kromas over Kelthis though, just because theres only one Flying Bear of Doom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meshugene</div><div class="date">03-20-2007, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deadmines is an awesome instance! Have you ran it before? I bring my horde characters thru it even with no quests because it's just so fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">03-21-2007, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like the others have said, instances like Deadmines can help break things up. Other than that if you rotate between Redridge, Wetlands, Duskwood, and Ashenvale you will be suprised at how fast you can get to lvl 30.<br />
<br />
 To me I think 30-35 is the worst bump in the road but still its not all that bad. I recently got my Draenai shaman to lvl 20 but it was all new content for me so I never got bored. I still have a couple quests to clean up but after that I will be hitting the zones that I mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">03-21-2007, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are 20 already done with Westfall and havent touched Redridge, then I can see why you are bored.  Go over there and there are tons of interesting quests to keep you busy then you move straight into Duskwood(my favorite zone of the game, the quests are great)<br />

And as for leveling..1-40 is a blast, 40-60 I cant stand, 60-70 is a blast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll second this.  I find the first forty to be a ton of fun.  Very easy and just lots of great stuff.  Once I crest forty, I just shudder to think of leveling to 60.  I can do it.  I can do it fairly quickly, but its still not quite as fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, my toons if I decide I don't like them get killed off between 10 and 15.  Leveling to 10 is beyond easy if I can't get a feel for a class between 10 and 15 I have to kill them off. <br />
<br />
Leveling to mid 30s and 40 is pretty easy, with some bumps along the ways.  From mid 40s to 58 I LOATHE.  60 - 70 is great though.<br />
<br />
My mage is currently 64, still hanging out in Terrokar Forest ( and I have a lot to do here still ) before heading out to Nagrand which I expect I won't hit till 65 or maybe 66 ( I spend a lot of time killing to skin =D to earn $ for my mounts ).  With all the skinning I'll be doing in Nagrand I fully expect to have my epic mount fund near complete.  <br />
<br />
My druid has pretty much been resigned to instance running, herb farming and fishing ( golden fish sticks for my druid poached blue fish for my mage =D ).</div></div><hr />

I have 2 alts at 44/45 now and I just... can't... seem... to... level... them, lol.  I dunno what it is at that level, but I always seem to get burned out.  I reaaally wish they'd add in some new quests for 30-60 or so.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">God I have one alt stuck at 47.  I know where to go and what to do, but with the change in BC, there is nobody running the instances any more.  So even though I found 50-60 fast the last time, I just don't want to go there... there's no easy way to get into BRD or UBRS or any of the others.  So it makes the prospects of doing the 50s that much more painful.....</div></div><hr />
