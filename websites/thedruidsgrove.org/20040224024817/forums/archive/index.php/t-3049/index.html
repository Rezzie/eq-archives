<br />
Post names or pics if you have them and only take into consideration the actual graphic-not stats. Druid useable of course.<br />
<br />
Wild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimphe Wildwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hammer of Hours (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=21886)<br />
Cool Ice Blue color with sparklies.<br />
<br />
Greatstaff of Power (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24793)<br />
Same graphic as what the Rathe Council wields.<br />
<br />
Xephyrus, Wand of the Flowing Wind (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26788)<br />
Which is dubbed the Fairy Princess Wand.<br />
<br />
Or you can click on the links and have a looksie instead.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Xephyrus has the same graphic as the Ceramic Rod of Storms, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
(Speaking of which, the Ceramic Rod of Storms has a pretty cool look for a tradeskill-made item that's relatively easy to come by...)<br />
<br />
Let's see, what else...is the offhand included?<br />
Tactician's Shield from time:<br />
lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28656 (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28656)<br />
(graphic looks just like the icon)<br />
I liked how the Tactician's Bulwark looked too before everyone got one. :P<br />
<br />
Skull Shaped Sacrificial Hammer, which looks like a skull on a short stick, just like the...Hategiver I think?<br />
lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=3381 (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=3381)<br />
<br />
Some of the weapons commonly dropped by yard trash in luclin and LoY look pretty good too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to think the rod of storms looked cool until friends of mine pointed out that it looked like a super charged sparkling dildo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope the images work =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crescent Heartwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">what's the look of Ritual Claws of the Scion from the Mistmoore adventure vendor? 1492 points and nice stats.. just very curious if it's the old Bladed Thulian Claw type look as the icon on it suggests =(<br />
<br />
Anyone buy it yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The claws have a unique graphics.  The look like (RL) brass knuckles with blades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the Split Blade of Distruction.<br />
and you really cant go wrong with the Primal Spear look.<br />
<br />
Vinecutter also looks great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SuburbanLife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;I used to think ceramic rod of storms looked like crap until someone pointed out it looked like a super charged sparkling dildo.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Thats cute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haro the Battlemaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As druid the only real choice for the look can be the Greatstaff of Power. Sure, a combo of Hammer of Hours and any shield from PoTime gives some more mana, hp and resists, but the look simply owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt; As druid the only real choice for the look can be the Greatstaff of Power.[/quote]<br />
<br />
I wish you would to that twirly twirly of godly smackdown that Rathe Councilmen do when you swing the grearstaff.  As far as looks, that staff is by far the most unique look that exists in the game.<br />
<br />
I'm still debating what to spend my dkp on.  The staff looks awesome but the hammer is all about fun with procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shield of Energy in my offhand, I'm going for the hammer myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Petrified Fiend Spine (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=55226) from Sol C is pretty neat looking.  It looks like the Greatstaff of the Four Winds (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24780), only it is a 1-hander or range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Suva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm still debating what to spend my dkp on. The staff looks awesome but the hammer is all about fun with procs.  <br />
<br />
I like the staff since I can melee with it and the high proc rate is much better than medding.  In ldon adventures when I'm not able to find a c3/c5, I can melee witht he staff and never sit to med unless all heck breaks loose with a pull.  Oh, and the graphic so owns.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sealody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I went and got the Hammer of hours and Quarm's shield.<br />
<br />
Nice anyway you look at it...  Kinda bum'd they used the same cornav graphic as the shield.  Not as unique when another guild ends up killing coirnav.  But for now... <br />
<br />
Little blue sparklies.... everywhere I run!<br />
<br />
Sea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Greggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">WE got a shield on an adventure that looked like a willsapper when you held it (was all/all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Avendesoral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pestilence Scythe &gt; all that sparkly junk =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Crescent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still have a pestilence scythe in the bank.. I stopped carrying it around awhile back when I realized I hadn't equipped it in over a year.. there's just not much more that screams druid to me than a scythe.<br />
<br />
As to a cool looking handheld graphic.. this ranks up there there in my opinion.  It's another druid on Solusek Ro in the pic if you couldn't tell =)<br />

Beacon of Loathing (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=52059) from Inny 3.0 in Hate.<br />
