Solteris access 4 - Counter Attack mission <br />
 <br />
The last named spawns a level 77 add every 30 seconds that hits pretty weak, and has about 10khp. I had a group last night that was able to offtank that named for a good 3-4 hours and the dps just killed the adds every 30s. using lotd for 30 minutes of it, I went from about 20% into 76 to just dinging 78 when we left. Not to mention the mission netted everyone 195 orum. It really only worked because the healing required wasnt enough to out pace the regen. Also, I think one of the group members said the boss was fully slowable. The warrior tank put on a shield and unequiped primary, and clicked off DS to make sure the named didnt die.</div></div><hr />

Date Posted: 11/14 4:43pm Subject: Already dozens of lvl 80's same day as expansion release <br />
 <br />
I checked my server there were dozens of lvl 79-80 chars already they used the shroud trick to store exp when they unshrouded they were lvl 79, if you ask me this is an exploit. <br />
 <br />
I checked other servers same thing there are 100's of players that used this....<br />
<br />
it seems there was some sort of shroud exploit and ppl could instantly gain lvl 79 and 80 after launch.<br />
 <br />
They simply stored up exp and when they un-shrouded they were insta-leveled.</div></div><hr />

I just don't understand the fun in that? There have been level cap increases to so many skills that they are going to be &quot;catching up&quot; forever. Also, what fun is it to shroud and not see all the new content and mobs and do the quests and get faction and all of that?<br />

It doesn't require cheats and it doesn't require chaining yourself to the computer.  It does require pinpointing places with good experience and being efficient.<br />
<br />
Thallasius missions in Katta yield excellent experience.  Go in, kill to the statue location, pop lesson, kill everything you can as fast as you can.  If you're exping the mission itself is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Druids can swarm charm kite - I got a third of a level in 1 1/2 hours at my favorite spot.  There are also numerous open zone camp sites in SoF.  Added up all total, I'd guess about 20 hours of effort to got from 75.99 to 80.</div></div><hr />

We did know about the silly experience exploit in solt 4 and chose not to use it.  That really did seem like cheating.  Chain killing Thal mobs, on the other hand, seems perfectly fair.</div></div><hr />
