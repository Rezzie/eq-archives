<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rishta</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all. This is my first post on this board and I thought I would ask for the advice of some of the folks who have high level druid characters (and thus have gone through most if not all of the growing pains I will at some point). My question is....what should I specialize in. <br />
<br />
The real debate in my head is entirely over Evocation or Conjuration. Right now most of the spells I cast (while soloing) are Conjuration based, but I have noticed that many if not all of the direct damage, AoE and some of the dot's at higher levels (I just dinged 30) are evocation. Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">03-22-2003, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most druids will say either evocation (nukes) or alteration (heals). It just depends on your play style. I haven't heard of to many conjuration spec druids but if you plan to root dot most of your way thru eq then I can see why you would spec in that. <br />
<br />
There's a poll in the poll forum on this topic...check it out when you get the chance.<br />

Also, you can always change your spec later if you don't like what you picked early on. It's a quest although I'm not sure of the details</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your into Quad Kiting (or normal blast kiting until you get lighting strike) go with Evoc. Not much you can quad past 60 (without some really nice gear), and if you want the fastest exp you shouldnt quad much past 54 or so. <br />
<br />
If your into grouping, go with Alteration. Heals and ports and manasucking buffs use Alteration. Also, charming is based on Alteration. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind you can change spec as many times as you want, simply by giving a ruby to an NPC in the Temple of Sol Ro. However, it takes a LONG LONG LONG LONG time to get your new spec maxed out. I have changed once on my current main char. <br />
<br />
If your looking for the fastest exp, I think evoc/quad till low 50's, then switch to alter and charm kite to 62+. If you want OK experiance that doesnt take complete consentration for hours on end, root dot (conjur) is a great choice. Also, if you like dungouns root dot will serve you well. <br />
<br />
GL in your choice,<br />

I can hold my own in pretty much any cheal chain and usually am in them right along with the clerics with KR. <br />
<br />
I can say that the specialization switch to alteration has still left me with plenty of nuking mana with SCM3 to boot.</div></div><hr />

If you have junk equipment and are building an untwinked charater then root dot might be your best choice.  You can med while the mob is rooted and the dots are fairly efficient.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that many of the lower level roots just sucked... back in the day... so many druids would dot kite which requires sow + snare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not quite right.  You're assuming that a grouping druid does a lot of healing.  That isn't always the case.  A grouping druid can do quite a bit of nuking, and in fact, my preferred grouping role is dotting and nuking.  I leave the bulk of the healing up to the cleric.  Even as an evoc druid, I can perform the healing role quite well when called upon to do so.<br />
<br />
If you are over 50, keep in mind that our fire-based DoTs are EVOC based spells, and that with evoc spec, Breath of Ro is more efficient than Winged Death.   At 65, I use Fury of Ro quite a bit along with WD or SD, so overall, I'd say my dotting is about 50/50 evoc/conjuration.<br />
<br />
If you like to DD nuke, choose evoc.<br />
<br />
If you like to AoE group, choose evoc.<br />
<br />
If you like to quad kite, choose evoc.<br />
<br />
If you like to heal or buff all the time, choose alteration.<br />
<br />
If you like to root dot, choose evoc or conjuration.<br />
<br />
If you like to use charm, choose evoc (Why?  Because I am going to be using a lot of evoc DDs or PBAEs to damage the mob quickly in order to get the best XP.  For every charm I cast, I cast 5 to 10 DDs.)</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I get the impression that you'd rather click a 10 point free DD 100 times than cast a single 1000+ point DD...:)  <br />
<br />
I like the target to go down faster, especially if it is a summoning mob (and many of my targets are).  Bigger nukes = faster kill = less chance of charm breaking while engaged.   I also have better things to put in that finger slot.<br />
<br />
I use DC basically only for tradeskill farming.   I use a DCed greenie to go and round up a  pack of 10 to 20 green mobs.  I then go in and cast Catastrophe (evoc spec) to kill them all in one swell foop.</div></div><hr />

At higher levels, the mobs hit for far too much to be healing yourself.<br />
<br />
Evocation however, will benefit when you solo, as well as when you group / raid.<br />
<br />
Alteration will benefit only when grouped / raiding.<br />
<br />
After all you cannot heal a mob to death.  (wish you could heal undead for dmg like most RPG's)</div></div><hr />

Just a point of information: white ceramic band can be clicked from inventory. It does not have to be equipped.<br />
<br />
I've found mine to be handy for sneaking that requisite &quot;point of damage&quot; to get full Exp using charmed (non-DC) pets while I'm letting the pet get low health and don't want to do too much damage ... and also for breaking roots without wasting mana.<br />

As for breaking roots, I have the AA root skills, so my roots hold up to my DDs.   I haven't found that I needed to break root all that often.</div></div><hr />

With the recent improvements to the druid heal line ive switched over to alteration.<br />

Since they were nerfed, it's trivial to swap them with a bag, click on the mod rod, then drop it back in the bag.  If you even want to bother with them anymore.<br />
