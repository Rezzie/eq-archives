I'm still playing. It seems that WoW has become a gear chase lately, although i think that's just a side-effect of having smooth transitions from tier content to tier content, and the raids being 10 or 25-man optional.<br />
<br />
What with buying a house and getting married, it sounds like you're definitely staying busy. Cangratulations!</div></div><hr />

I recall level 39 Druid Twinks being super flag runners and great all around. Now I hear that if you opt to not get XP in a BG, the que times to get in can be as long as 2 hours. So is the twinking system a dead one? It can be pretty boring waiting for one to two hours to get into a BG.<br />
I was considering dusting off my EQ level 69 Druid if WoW is gonna just be about grinding now.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why it kept getting changed either.  I had to update links in our guides and so on.  Hopefully it stays the same now. :p<br />

Starfire, have you tried contacting AOL support to see if they can change your password?</div></div><hr />
