It took a petition to do it.  But that was back when GM guides actually came into the zone and up to your character to interact.  I hate that every petition is answered through the web interface now.  My suggestion is to ask for a name change and look for a GM using /w GM all command to see if they can accomodate you.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Or they could say it was offensive to them.  In some obscure language it means !@#$%%.<br />

The name policy is stupid.</div></div><hr />
