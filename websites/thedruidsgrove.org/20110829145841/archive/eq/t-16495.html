Can anyone confirm this, because I've been passing up essences to other people cause I don't have any steam cores to use em with cause they are a pita to get.  But if you can go from scratched hide + cryst essences that would be excellent.  Some links from alla / confermation from people who have done it would be extremely helpful and appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You can not bypass the steam core step of the armor upgrade.<br />
 <br />
On a side note...SOE has since made a change to allow steam and gyro cores to be converted to the class of your choice. You will need to purchase a Steam Core Re-gearing Kit along with your class gear kit, Druadic Core Gear Kit for druids, from Automated Vending Unit II. He is in DSH near the cannon to FM. Roughly 50k total, and they added a banker to the tents there as well. <br />
 <br />
Good luck !</div></div><hr />

gyro cores are slot restricted. they are re-coreable (so you can change to druadic). You can use either the steel studded, ancient husk, or uncored template (from strikeforce vendor in DSH) to combine with the cores. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the crystallos raid piece, it is also slot restricted, however thats it. As since it is the equivalent of the prismatic for group armor, there is no &quot;class&quot; on it, since its all/all useable. <br />
<br />

hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
