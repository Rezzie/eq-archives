Any suggestions on a decent charm I should try and replace it with?  I'd hate to waste 5k on a charm to have it be utterly useless.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Otherwise the best thing to get would be Tainted Heartstone (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30486), and just train languages up in PoK.<br />

I hear you group with someone, for example who speaks Ogre while you are a Woodelf.........but how exactly does the language skill increase, what do you need to do?<br />
Must you be in a group to do this or just sit in area?<br />
How quick do the languages  go up?<br />
When a person is speaking the new language, what do they say? Do they just spam anything or what is there to talk about if the other person cannot even understand the new language?</div></div><hr />

Mine is something like:<br />
<br />
/g You love me<br />
/g You worship me<br />
/g You will send me money<br />
/g You will buy me presents<br />
/g You will be my slave<br />
<br />
Change your language to whichever you're trying to teach, and spam the heck out of your group. Takes about 10 minutes to max (100).<br />
<br />
If the person you're teaching also selects that language and spams back (ie trying to speak it) they'll skill up slightly faster.<br />
<br />
But they can also teach you, say, ogre, while you teach them...vah shir.<br />

I know many people on most servers are masters of all languages, (100 skill is max).  It is helpful but not usually a requirement for some people to want to get something out of teaching you a language, teach them a language, or some will offer languages for pp.<br />
 <br />
I used a hotkey from the song from when I did epic 1.5 and just made it spam in group chat. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, you can /ignore the person speaking and still gain the skill points.<br />
<br />
Go figure.</div></div><hr />

******Here is a curious  question..........I think Elder Dragon is a language if i recall, how did folks years ago on EQ start learning  Elder Dragon if no race is created with it? <br />
Even if you added points at your guild master, how did folks increase in it if the only means of getting higher in it was your guild master?<br />
I recall hearing about Elder Dragon as a language back in 2000 i think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if your elder dragon is at 10, you can teach someone up to 11. They can then teach you elder dragon up to 12, and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeyn Kaidyrsi</div><div class="date">09-04-2005, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way I found was to put one training point into all languages not already possessed, then had both my chars spam each other.  Tae already had mastered the dark elf languages and had a start on the vah shir and a few others.  It took several days, and by the time I was done, my wrists were a wee bit sore.  But both Tae (wood elf) and Taeka (gnome) mastered all languages.  At the time, I wasn't even aware of the Tainted Heartstone.  It was just something silly I was doing while my partner was not able to play because of work.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I noticed I gained skillups by speaking, not just hearing.  I also noticed it is no longer true that you can teach a language to someone only up to one skill point higher than your current skill.  Sometimes I spammed with only one char, instead of both.  The &quot;student&quot; often got at least two skillups past the level of the &quot;teacher.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I can teach you some if you like. Shoot me a tell if you want. Btw, I never see you on late and you're on my friends list. Where did you run off to? =)</div></div><hr />

Now wehn I'm running around doing nothing inparticular I'll just group with my Bazaar mule and spam my hot key. You don't have to be in the same zone and it takes about ten minutes tops to max one out. This is from me starting at a skill of one and her with zero. Very easy to do.</div></div><hr />
