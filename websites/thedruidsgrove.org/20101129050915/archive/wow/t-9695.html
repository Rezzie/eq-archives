I love the PvE angle of this game.. I just HATE when an &quot;all resto&quot;-druid start saying he's better at this game than me.<br />
<br />
Healing is a good thing. But WHY do you priorit to kill a MOB than a player.<br />
<br />
No, I'm sorry.. I dont care if you have downed Nefarian with your goild.. your a crappy player anyways. And you have warcraftmovies.com to prove it. :)<br />
<br />
Killing players &gt; Killing mobs<br />
<br />
And yes.. I have killed nefarian also.. so stop pressing that in my face. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">12-05-2005, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not everyone enjoys PvP, personally I've been there done that, it's no longer exciting.  Since I don't enjoy PvP there's no reason for me to spec for PvP.  PvP can be interesting, and I almost enjoy the BG way that PvP is in WoW; and yet it still comes down to whining and crying on message boards about lag, ganking, camping, ect..  In PvP no one is ever willing to say okay hey you beat me fair and square you are better than I am.  It's always you only beat me because . . .<br />
Whining and excuses about being killed in PvP got old 6 years ago.  When our guild kills Nef he doesn't post on the message boards telling us how much we suck because we actually heal our mages, in PvE we are competing soley against ourselves ~ we race against others but what they do has no effect on whether or not we can pull together a quality team and work together to achieve something that requires 40 people to be at peak performance.<br />
<br />
I spend 90% of my in game time healing, and believe me I'm no healbot (I hate that term  as much as I hate the term dR00d).  Since I am a healer and I enjoy healing I'm dang well gonna spec and equip myself in a fashion that makes me the best healer I can be.  <br />
<br />
The spec that I have and the way that I play this or any other game are based on what I enjoy and what I want out of it.  I don't believe that it necessarily makes me a better player than anyone else.  If someone else has a different prefered playstyle more power to them I hope they enjoy what they are doing.  <br />
<br />
But it absolutly goes both ways.  Every time a PvP player dishes PvE, everytime a Feral spec dishes on Restoration, evertime raid guilds are refered to as having no life, evertime the term healbot is tossed around my respect lowers for the person that is speaking.  Respect is earned it's not a given.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">12-07-2005, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IF we really wanted to get into a pissing match I could just as easily say HOTW &gt; Innervate for PVP since HOTW can't be purged and is really the only true hybrid talent we have (read as it is the only talent that 100% boosts all of our forms).  I guess if you are horde though this matter is moot.  <br />
<br />
However its not about this over that.  Restoration is a strong tree.  But for a long time any other druid took a lot of crap for going against the grain.  Not only from other classes but from other druids too.  How can anyone blame those long time feral or balance druids for some animosity?  Since for so long even our restoration counterparts in our druid family have out cast us.  Restoration druids now get angry at feral or balance druids because we (well feral at least) are finally having a day in the sun.  But really its nothing which we haven't had to endure from you (meaning resto druids).  Its karma.  So next time you want to get pissed at a feral druid for some comment look back at some of the things restoration druids have spewed out about us.  <br />
<br />
That being said, all trees have their strengths.  With HOTW its nothing for me to throw on my healer suit and keep up my pvp party.  Especially since I have more mana than you.  The difference is you have a faster HT which is kinda nice.  I don't miss natures swiftness at all.  Granted it might save someone here and there.  But against the organized teams I have to play against, nature's swiftness or not, chances are when they set their sights on somebody that person will die.  And when that person dies, or when they notice my green hands, they decide they want to kill me.  I can still go bear and I have a better chance at fighting my way out with my stronger feral.  But then my healing isn't going to help me now, maybe nature's swiftness would have let me at least escape.  <br />
<br />
Fact is druid is one of the last classes (due to our crappy itemization and benefit from weapons) that skill &gt; gear &gt; talents.<br />
<br />
My crit and attack power mean jack if I'm hibernated or beast feared.  Your healing means jack if I just unloaded an opener to 5 point kill move in less than 5 seconds.  A balance druids spell means jack if they don't position themselves to lay out their damage/crowd control or don't conserve mana.  <br />
<br />
Feral=Restoration=Balance in PVP.  Really PVE too if you can get the right set up.  <br />
<br />
For me personally and my playstyle I can do more with a feral druid than I will ever achieve with Balance or Restoration.  That might not be true for you.  If that's the case, be the best Restoration or Balance druid you can be and I salute you for being great at something I can't.  But don't come out here putting down your feral or balance brothers and sisters.  That's the reason why we have become alienated from all you resto folks.  <br />
<br />
Support us, afterall everything we do, everything we achieve in our own respective specs and styles.  It all furthers the same class you chose to play too.  The Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonbinder</div><div class="date">12-07-2005, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The druid is indeed an amazing class. I love how you can always stay busy contributing to the team. (I very rarely pvp, i'm all about instance running) In MC for example, I hated going in as my priest for the trash mobs, people take so little damage there you nearly fall asleep. On my druid, i'm in catform (along with the other 3 feral druids), in &quot;dps&quot; groups so that they benefit from our leader of the pack buff. (me, 2 rogues, a warrior, a hunter usually). 3 feral druids X 3% more crit per person , thats alot of dps across those 15 members under the effect of lotp. Generally i'm around 11 or 12 in damage until we get to bosses and I go into healing mode (with 8K mana from raid buffs), and +271 healing from mostly blue items. As a druid, you have the ability to contribute to the team what they need the most, and thats what makes us druids. On trash mobs, dps is needed whereas healing is needed little, on bosses some boosted healing power is needed and that is what is contributed then. We are overloaded on warriors, so in a raid situation I haven't had the opportunity to tank, but in 5 mans and UBRS i do it quite a bit. I'm sure as a resto druid you should be able to contribute dps when it is needed also. The only time your failing as a druid is if your standing around tossing a rejuv when its barely needed, if priests have the situation under control healing wise then your best bet is to put on your feral gear and do some damage. But then again I'm blessed being in a good guild that realizes the synergy between tanking, dps, and healing, and understands on which occassions you need more of one then the other. In my opinion, if you never use your feral forms in pve, either you are really hurting for healers, or you should have rolled a priest.</div></div><hr />

Unless your guild is severely lacking healers, Feral Druids &gt; Resto Druids in PVE.</div></div><hr />

Play as you enjoy, have fun (its a game).<br />

I love my druid, but the biggest problem I see is that groups and raids don't know what we are going to do.  You will never see the tell &quot;Looking for Druid for  ??? run&quot;.  They know when they get a mage or priest or warrior what they can expect that player to do and how to use them.  A druid player may be every bit as capable a player and a very good druid, but the leader of the group or raid might have been expecting very different play style than what they got and it throws off the team's strategy.</div></div><hr />

Don't let them get to you.  I am a former Restoration Spec ( I am 0/30/21 now) and I was offered the chance to be the healer for the MT with the priest.  As long as you know how to heal and manage your mana Feral Druids with the right gear can still keep pace with Restoration Druids.  They have Innervate, we have more Mana.</div></div><hr />
