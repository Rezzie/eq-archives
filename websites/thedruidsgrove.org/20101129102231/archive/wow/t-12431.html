<br />
Ashtongue Talisman of Equilibrium (http://thottbot.com/i32486)<br />
<br />
Now I dont know what trinkets to use. Im not good at the math so I dunno if anyone has any input. I really don't know what would be best at the end. Here are my other trinkets:<br />
<br />
Essence of the Martyr (http://thottbot.com/i29376)<br />
Living Root of the Wildheart (http://thottbot.com/i30664)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-27-2008, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would take the &quot;Ashtongue Talisman of Equilibrium&quot;<br />
and the &quot;Essence of the Martyr&quot;.<br />
As i experienced the &quot;Living Root of the Wildheart&quot; has very low proc rate. I think its 3%.<br />
I would prefer a steady 84 +heal and the extra one when needed.<br />

Evaluating the actual buff this trinket will give is not easy, especially when looking at the Rejuv buff. Even formulas like the one Firebug uses wont give an accurate representation because you will not cast a rejuvenation exactly every x seconds. In a fight you might cast 5 rejuvs after each other and then none for 20 seconds, which is hard to put into simple formulas.<br />
So thats when i remembered my course of Mathematical Simulation, which taught some techniques that you can use to simulate this kind of behavior. I will put a bit of the technical stuff below but this is my findings for the Rejuvenation part.<br />
<br />
I made up this table like this:<br />
Casting rejuv once every X seconds on average will mean the buff will be up Y% of the time, giving an actual buff of Z healing.<br />
<br />
Every 2 secs -&gt; 59.4% -&gt;125 healing. (might not be very accurate, see below)<br />
Every 2,5 secs -&gt; 53.0% -&gt; 111 healing.<br />
Every 3 secs -&gt; 47,7% -&gt;100 healing.<br />
Every 4 secs -&gt; 39,4% -&gt; 83 healing.<br />
Every 5 secs -&gt; 33,3% -&gt; 70 healing.<br />
Every 6 secs -&gt; 28,8% -&gt; 61 healing.<br />
Every 8 secs -&gt; 22,6% -&gt; 48 healing.<br />
Every 10 secs -&gt; 18,6% -&gt; 39 healing.<br />
Every 15 secs -&gt; 12,9% -&gt; 27 healing.<br />
<br />
What I did was use one of my old M/M/1 Matlab files and adjusted it to simulate rejuv casts. For each average number of casts I simulated 100.000 fights of 10 minutes. The only problem I ran into, was that because Im using a Poisson-process to simulate 'inter-cast-times', it would sometimes come up with 'inter-cast-times' of less than 1,5 secs, which of course isnt possible, so I simply rounded up low casttimes to 1,5. This has some effect on especially the simulations with lots of casts per minute. This means that the actual effectiveness of the trinket is probably a few +healing higher when casting rejuv once every 2-3 seconds, but for the rest this effect is negligible.<br />

That's only if you're in tree form, though.  If you're in a different form it gives you a different blessing.<br />

If you're forgetting to use your trinkets all the time, just macro them to one of your heals.  This way, you may not be using them as intelligently as you could be, but at least you aren't wasting the CD.</div></div><hr />
