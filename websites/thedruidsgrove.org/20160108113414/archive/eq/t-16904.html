Meanwhile let your warrior damage them a bit and he will get the exp.<br />
 <br />
Low level shroud form has penalty, so don't shroud for too low.  I think the best level is the highest one with mobs still con red. So let's say your druid can take 5 level 55 mobs at a time, then shroud the war to level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelfin</div><div class="date">11-18-2008, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i checked out the shroud idea. i have a baby 65 war that i am PLing. using the murkglider cave on the east side of WOS (just below port in) i get 24% AAXP. i normally pull 8/8/9 so it's 6 AA clearing the whole cave.<br />
<br />
i shrouded down to 60 and did the same thing. i get 30% AAXP doing this, or 7.5 AA for a full clear. 4 clears = 30AA. very nice.<br />
<br />
it seems if i shroud down to 55 i get less AA, so there is definitely a line that can be crossed that gives smaller returns.<br />
<br />
4.5 days played on the war and he's 65 with 562 AA atm. very easy to add 30-50 AA an evening. once i get GoD AAs knocked out i'll level him to 70 and stop again for more AA and see how well shrouds work.<br />
<br />
next all i have to do is get him some gear that isn't crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'll experiment and actually try a 65 shroud and see if it still gets more aaxp.</div></div><hr />

Good way to get her moving with out using too much time on her.<br />
War get 6 aa per lesson in LP using same strat, he lvl 77. When he was lvl 71 (like mage now) I got about 10 aa per lesson. If shroud could get me closer to that it would be cool.<br />
