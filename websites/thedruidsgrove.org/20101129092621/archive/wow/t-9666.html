<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-28-2005, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently hit 300 herbalism and 275 alch, made my philosophers stone and have the recipie for arcanite transmute.  I have been searching the AH to determine what to sell, and have made the most money selling herbs, though am looking forward to selling arcanite bars.  <br />
<br />
My question to everyone is, I know certain tailor / leatherworker recipies call for potions (minor agil, etc.), and that faction can be gained through trading herbs (or so I have heard) with some npc's.  Can anyone list out specific occasions that need herbs or pots?  Also, i realize that selling herbs is more profitable than selling pots.  Why is this?</div></div><hr />

Thott Alchemy List (http://www.thottbot.com/?t=Alchemy)<br />
If you follow the links on Thott for each potion it will tell you what quests and items need them.  The only herb turn in that I know currently is for Thorium Brotherhood and it needs kingsblood.<br />
<br />
There's several reasons why herbs sell better than potions;  there are some alchemists that aren't herbalists, herbing is the time consuming part of alchemy, bank and bag space, and that for flasks require very large amounts of herbs, flasks are rarely sold but are the potions most desired for raiding.  The primary one is the time consuming part our guild has about 10-15 fairly active herby/alchemists that spend a large amount of free time gathering just for raids but our banks will still buy stacks of herbs whenever they can from the AH to suppliment those we collect.</div></div><hr />

I haven't gotten to making flasks yet, though have read over some of them on thott.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">11-30-2005, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dreamfoil, icecap, gromsblood, Plaguebloom, Mountain Silversage, Golden Sansam and Black Lotus are the big ones but we do use Wild Steelbloom, Goldthorn, Khadgar's Whisker and Purple Lotus's as well.  <br />
<br />
Dreamfoil is our biggest want since it's used in almost everything, followed closely by Gromsblood for Flasks of Titans.  Black Lotus now that it is tradeable is probably the best money maker around it's just a matter of knowing the spawn points and how the cycle works (only one Lotus will spawn per continent at a time).  Black Lotus is used in every flask but you only need one per flask so don't try to gather stacks to sell just sell as you can in singles or small stacks (5ish).</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna thott it tonight when I get home to find spawn locations for Black Lotus and Dreamfoil.  I have been making mass +25 agil and +25 str pots for my guildies, but I need to make some cash for myself :rolleyes: <br />

I have been wanting to get the greater mana potion recipie ( I think that this is the one that restores 1200 - 1700 mana.. not sure of the name ).. Does anyone know if I can buy that from a vendor, if its a drop, etc?  Everytime I see it at AH its like 10-15g or something.  I'm sure that this is pretty easy to thott, though im at work.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure which mana potion you mean:<br />
<br />
Greater Mana Potion is 700-900 and is trainer purchased.<br />
<br />
Superior Mana Potion is 900-1500 is a limited supply recipe from alchemist supply in Darnassas or Undercity.  <br />
<br />
Major Mana Potion is 1300-2250 and is purchsed from the ghost vendor outside of Scholomance.  You can only see the vendor if you have the trinket from the quests.  Walkthrough for quest series is here (http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=8695)<br />
<br />
Superior is probably the one you mean you'll probably have to check the vendor quite often before you find it.  I think that I ended up sticking an alt in front of the vendor so I wouldn't have to keep hiking to UC ever few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again N!  You are just full of useful info :) <br />
<br />
What lvl should I be before I start running Scholo?  If I have to wait till late 50s, it might be worth it for me to buy the recipie for like 10g, then start making major mana pots to sell (they are in low supply in the AH on my server, at least every time I checked).  I could probably make the money back easily before I got to high 50's...<br />
<br />
Is there a major health pot as well?  If so, is that quest, or purchase?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say 56-57 min. for Scholo, so you have at least some chance of damaging the mobs (and not drawing as much aggro).  60 is best though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yrys is dead on about level and you can't buy the major mana potion recipe from another player it's no drop so you have to either do the quests in Scholo or do Scholo a ton and get lucky to get it as a drop from Raz(? haven't been to scholo in a while so drawing a blank on the final bosses name) recipe is an extremely rare drop from him.<br />
<br />
Major Healing potion is bought from goblin vendor in Wintersprings, it's a limited supply recipe I think but it is tradeable so you can get it from someone else, if you need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-02-2005, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nd yeah, you are right.  It was the major health pot that I saw on the AH.  I plan on doin the quests in scholo to get the recipie for major mana.  One of my friends just emailed me elixer of the mongoose :).  Haven't made any yet, but I'm guessing those will sell well.  Rogues / Hunters love those it seems.  <br />
<br />
Going to head up to wintersprings tonight to post up by the goblin vendor in hopes of getting the major health recipie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A method has been discovered to circumvent this requirement for Horde - it's posted at thottbot under the recipe.<br />
<br />
However, if you are level 60, the hardest thing about doing the quests are getting a group to 5-man Schololol.  While the zone is a lot easier (by leaps and bounds) that when the game was new, it's still the most challenging 5-man content in the game.  Perhaps for that reason, getting a (good) group to do it on an older server can be a challenge.<br />
<br />
While it's possible to complete the entire quest line in 1 run, expect it to take 2-3.</div></div><hr />
