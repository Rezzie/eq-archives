<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">POD I would say.  Unless you flagged for POV/POS. But then finding a group there at 57 is kinda hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Audo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been faced with the same problem. I have been boxing my druid/warrior combo (same levels interestingly enough).<br />
<br />
Duo'd AR and found the exp is slow there (it is nice having a whole zone to yourself though).<br />
<br />
Recently, I have been charming ravens in PoN and killing whatever with the druid and just let the warrior sit there and soak exp.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas on this I would be more than happy to listen as well. Sometimes you just don't want to group and enjoy the silence of boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ashikita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the fastest exp, druid charm kill is the way to go.  Sk can help with FD pulling, but watch the weird aggro in PoN.  This is before the charm exp nerf btw.<br />
<br />
For kiting, quadding in Grey was good exp for me, but that was before PoP came out.  Root/Dotting.... not sure.</div></div><hr />
