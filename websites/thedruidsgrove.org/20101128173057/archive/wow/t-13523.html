Blizz in adding something really useful shock !<br />
<br />
My DK hit 68 a week or so ago and i finally decided to try to thinkg about levelling her Alchemy.<br />
<br />
I needed new recipes as the ones i had were mainly green. So i thought i'd take a trip to HF or BT and have a look for the trainer and see the new recipes I could get.<br />
<br />
Of when i got there i suddenly remembered I was not going to be able to fly and commented in /g that i was not going to enjoy Northrend levelling as the flying i'd been able to do in Outland was ofc now not available to me until 77 !<br />
<br />
When someone suddenly said yes you can, go to the fcold weather flying trainer in Dal and you can buy a BoA Tome !<br />
<br />
Off i go and sure enough i'm now able to fly in Northrend at 68 :)<br />
<br />
Cost 1000g but soooo worth it :)<br />
Added in a recent patch i understand....its so easy to miss 'little' bits like this when reading patch notes....<br />

I've used two of the tomes so far, it makes the starting zones an entirely different experience for a character new to Northrend.  I just wish they were not single use only items, but I guess then they'd have to be insanely expensive to balance it out.<br />
<br />
Now if I can just get the 5k for epic flight on my second alt.. :eek: Back to the grind.</div></div><hr />
