The first half of the zone is mines and low con mobs.  The middle of the zone is medium con mobs and is an open area with the bridge in the middle.  The last half of the zone is the highest con mobs within the rooms and hallways.  You could clear an opening in the middle area and pull the high cons to there - there will be very few single pulls from the back.<br />
 <br />
Btw, a piece for necro epic 1.5 drops there randomly off of any mob (wish I knew that when I was PLing my necro through the 40s =(.)</div></div><hr />

With the 63 Charm Command of Tunare you can charm the exhausted bloodtusk who makes a mean pet in there, but first he needs to be up, thats once you get to 63 and get that spell of course. When you hit 62 goto HoH and kite there. Although its been awhile the xp there migh suck as well. Dire Charm is actually useful in HoH at that level. <br />
<br />
If you go charming in Nadox remember in tight quarters you will need to have enough space to recharm your pet if it breaks charm. Its ok to root your own pet then recharm it then drag mobs to it until root wears of.</div></div><hr />

The exp will however be fairly slow.  From zone in you go through a fake wall into an area of tunnels, the first room on the right the center mob is pher for named, the second opening on the left the pher is the mob in the far right rear.  Can easily snare-pull-zone these mobs solo.  <br />
<br />
     Nadox would give you better exp, and there is there is one area with a drop that might be worthwhile farming for you.  On the way to hates fury there is a large rectangular room full of undead, this is the first undead trolls above the dock area (next to the room where the broodmother spawns if that helps).  In this area an undead weaponsmith will spawn who can drop as rare a druid neck item that has a clickie pet buff.<br />
<br />
     Realistically tho I would go to POP or perhaps OOW zones instead, both loot and exp will be better.<br />

The exhausted bloodtusk is available a little over half the time in my experience.<br />
<br />
At L65 I would get an AA in about 2 hours, not counting vet reward, and cash was around 800pp to 1200pp an hour depending on luck with the gem drops. The pig kills in about a minute per victim. At L66 the zombies begin to go light blue.<br />
<br />
When the vehement and furious blackhands are still dark blue, in the 50s, they also make excellent targets using the lower level pigs.<br />
<br />
The zone is very forgiving if you need time to run around and recharm your pig, just keep it snared.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy and relaxing zone I always found.</div></div><hr />
