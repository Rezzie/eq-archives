Anywho...<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration still continues but at a slightly reduced rate. Mana reducing abilities such as Viper Sting and Mana Burn have no effect while in forms.  (click me for wowwiki source!) (http://www.wowwiki.com/druid )<br />
<br />
	 Spirit/5 + 15....Mana gained per tick per spirit-&gt;1/5 (http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Mana_Regen)<br />
<br />
Yeah...might be a waste of a new post, but is this all correct?  Mp5 is not included...is it unaffected?</div></div><hr />

Most likely MP5 does not get included because now, while in form, you technically do not have mana. That's why Viper Sting and Mana Burn does not affect your mana pool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So w/out a mana bar, the mp5 has no affect?  So if I'm want regen informs while defending (stealth FTW!) I should pursue &quot;of spirit&quot; greens only, and spirit enchantments on the greens?<br />
<br />
oof</div></div><hr />

Spirit does help mana regen in forms (90% sure) but I always assumed MP5 helped too but since technically our mana bar isn't there (thus like guice mentioned, Viper Sting and Mana Burns don't affect us) I'm curious if Mp5 does infact increase our mana regen while in feral forms.<br />

I'd always thought that your mana regen went by whatever it said on your Character Pane. =/</div></div><hr />

If it helps, there's an addon (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/129/) that'll tell you how much mana you have (give or take) in animal form. ^.^ IMHO very useful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, no money for another game card means I gotta satisfy addiction somehow...so expect more postings from me for awhile O.o</div></div><hr />

@ Annikk :: Thought so. I was talking about this with other druids and my guild and some people said (like you) only Spirit affected mana regen in forms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is fairly easy to confirm: blast some mobs with spells until almost oom, shift, kill a few mobs in fuzzy form for awhile, then shift out to heal. Suddenly, you have a full mana bar.<br />
<br />
Can't report the exact numbers, because I haven't concentrated on this issue that much.<br />
<br />
Wowwiki reports a reduced mana regeneration. Again I don't have exact numbers but I can confirm this too. Humanoid form regenerates mana faster than feral forms.<br />
<br />
I use Spartan, a bundle of ui add-ons. It has an add-on that helps druids in bear or kitty form see what their mana bar status is. Problem is, its VERY approximate, prone to not just small differences but wild divergences from reality. Barely useful, more annoying than anything else.<br />
<br />
But now that you mention it, I might sit down and squeeze some numbers out of it.</div></div><hr />
