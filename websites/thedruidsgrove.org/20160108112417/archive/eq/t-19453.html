<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigskyn</div><div class="date">08-13-2009, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Returning after hanging up the druid in 2004/OoW was just warming up and my old guild was trying to finish keying for Time.  Obviously a great deal has changed since and I've spent about 3 weeks trying to absorb what I can in small increments.<br />
<br />
I don't have a current magelo created, though I'll work on one if responders really think it will help, but my request is pretty generic.  I am current on spells through 65 that don't require faction/instancing work on expansions after OoW. I have otherwise replaced my old Planes gear with defiant and upgraded non-vis slot items with the best purchasable gear I could find for my budget.<br />
<br />
I have spent a lot of the last three weeks finishing getting my warrior box up to 65 and my intent now is to work on AA's for both characters for awhile before leveling up any more (druid @200 aa's/ Warrior only about 60). Much of this time was spent in the Eldar Longshadow instance hoping for a clicky lev cape for the warrior. Got him a totem of wurines, but nuttn else.<br />
<br />
In any case, outside of that instance, I'm looking at maybe moving to eldarr to quest/xp for a bit.  I am not in a guild and am not actively seeking one atm. <br />
<br />
Any other suggestions for good aa xp or necessary faction work given my warrior and 2 merc group? Quested/obtainable dropped gear with usefulness for either character that might improve the grind a bit (love the clickies and hard to farm items with purpose)? Opinions on DoN purchasable gear/augs/spells? Other things I should really have or maybe start working on for future leveling?<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated, especially to bridge the gap between 65 and 71. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I quit EQ during OOW and just recently returned a few months ago. I spent 65-70 and 400 AAs in The Steppes which is a great zone for charming. Many animals at entrance area that don't assist each other so you can pull to your heart's content. I was able to buy all my gear in the Bazaar and I am pleased with my current setup. Welcome back!</div></div><hr />

I had been beating up on the worgen at the druid circle there. I moved into Icefall when it became a hot zone. It takes a bit for my druid/warrior box to kill anything but the xp is pretty nice and I'm saving up on the tusks for Vald faction work.<br />
<br />
I had been looking forward to the 71 charm and reverse charming, I'll go check out how the xp is doing the same in the Steppes. :-)</div></div><hr />
