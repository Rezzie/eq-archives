<br />
The Start<br />
<br />
- Find Telin Darkforest (located in BW near Skyfire zone. Head a few seconds to the right when you enter BW from Skyfire and you get him into track)in Burning Woods and ask &quot;what action&quot; and you will get<br />
a note. if not, then your faction is too low. Faction can be<br />
built up fast by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport<br />
<br />
- Now go to Faelin<br />
Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark. She roams the northern part near and west of Crushbone entrance (spawnpoint is 1500, 500. Give her the note and you receivea ring. She is a rare spawn and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her the note she depops.<br />
<br />
- Giz X'Tin Kithikor roams the area near the path from West Commons to Highpass Hold. Give him the ring and you will get a dark metal coin. After you hand him the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks but you can run away with SoW. Don't help another druid or ranger with the Corruptor in East Karanas if you still have to do this part. Killing the Corrupter gives you bad Faction with Giz so that he won't give you back the coin for Telin.<br />
<br />
- Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will give it back to you as worn metal coin. He tells you to find Athele.<br />
<br />
- Athele in East Karanas can be found near the river just north of the barbarian fisher village. Give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. Give this amulet<br />
to Sionae (spawns -2300, -930), then to Nuien (spawns -3650, -300) and finaly to Teloa (spawns -3800, -2860). The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (I think all about lvl 48 to 50) to spawn on top of the hill east of the river(loc -1500, -1000). Don't start this part until you are ready to kill the DE Corruptor because all the druids except Athele are triggerd spawns. So don't start giving around the amulet and stop at the last stage. You need luck to meet the full druid gathering after another druid or ranger did that part successfully.<br />
<br />
- Find the Corruptor and kill him fast on the hill north of the river (loc -1500, -1000). He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You dont needto kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and loot the tome. The best way is to have one or two friends on the hill that can start fearkiting him. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele spawns again in about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring<br />
this to &quot;she who walks the land in service blabla...&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
- Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women<br />
that wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.<br />
<br />
The Hardened Mixture<br />
- You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl.<br />
<br />
- Chilled Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks<br />
<br />
- Sweetened Mudroots from Misty Thicket<br />
<br />
- Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp<br />
<br />
- Heartfruit from Greater Faydark<br />
<br />
- This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl and you get a Hardened -Mixture.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Runed Bowl<br />
<br />
- Go to the Chess Island (the lvl 52 Egress spell will take<br />
you there when you have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight &quot;how do you make an ancient bowl?&quot;. He gives you a crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe to talk to Farios Elianos. If Alrik wont respond to you, you have to raise Keepers of the Art faction.<br />
<br />
- Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. He can be found in the Library that is behind a door in the shop. If he dont respond to you then your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the batwing-quest in Felwithe south. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and you receive a grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him.<br />
<br />
- Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe north and she gives you in return a bag of Provisions.<br />
Bring it to Farios and he gives you the receipt for the ancient bowl. <br />
<br />
- Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the receipt. <br />
<br />
- The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece<br />
of echanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel. No skill in pottery required.<br />
<br />
- Platinum speckled poweder can be obtained through another<br />
subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. Head back with the silver chained locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall Galdes and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the platinum speckled pouder.<br />
<br />
- Enchanted clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him &quot;what mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; he will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get the enchanted clay. I am sure if you are kos to the dwarfs then you can do this part invisible. Just go to the Everhot Forge and hand Kinlo a Jade Reaver to get the clay.<br />
<br />
- Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl. No skill is required.<br />
<br />
The Stones<br />
<br />
- Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone from it.<br />
<br />
- Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie. <br />
<br />
- Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself? &quot;, &quot;what answers?&quot; and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot;. She tells you to bring her the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir. <br />
<br />
- Kill Venril Sathir (remains) in Karnor's Castle and loot the gem he<br />
drops. Venril is a lvl 55 Necromancer that can be beaten with a few groups. In order to get your gem you must give Venril Sathir's Remains a Resurrection spell scroll and a Firefly Globe that is summoned from our &quot;Dance of the Fireflies&quot; spell.<br />
<br />
- Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid and the Rangerpart. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.<br />
<br />
- The Druid's path leads back to Ella in Misty Thicket. <br />
Give her the stone and you will get the Elaborate Scimitar (10/30 9wis 10mana 5sv poison and disease, looks like the Runed Falchion)....now you have one of the four final pieces. She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with<br />
the scimitar to Xanuusus. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Cleansed Spirits<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cleansed Spirit of Antonica<br />
<br />
- The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find the corruption in the land. He means the Corrupted Mammoth (below lvl 30) in Everfrost Peaks (pops near Permafrost, Mammoth Calfs are PH), the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman (mid lvl 30) in Lake Rathe (PH are the sidespawns on top of the underwater-tower. Middle spawn is for Cleric Epic. Use wolfform to be non-aggro to the other goblins. They heal each other so kite him away. It can take several tainted to get the corrupted) and the Corrupted Hill Giant (mid lvl 30) in Rathe Mountains (HG area south of the hill with the Guard Tower).<br />
<br />
- Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to receive<br />
the treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas and give him the heart. You find him east of the bridge at the water. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer<br />
<br />
- You will meet a pained unicorn in lesser Faydark. Collect for him the items looted from the Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep (lvl 52, 1 or 2 groups needed. As far as I can remeber you have to pass the area where Estrella is and the named Seahorse Undertow), the Corrupted Cyclops (3-4 ppl, best tactic is fearkiting because he is lvl 52. PH are the Seafury Cyclops) in Ocean of Tears and from the Corrupted Brownie (Brownie Scouts are PH. They are green to 56/57 and give exp. Each can pop the tainted so it is possible that 2 or even 3 tainted roam the area. They are druids and the corrupted is a lvl 52 druid so you need help from 2 or 3 people. Fearkiting is the best tactic) in Lesser Faydark.<br />
<br />
- The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 3 items.<br />
This has to be handed to the gnome Silox Azrix in Ak'anon to get the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer. He is near the mines on the left side of the green river. There is another greeny gnome near him but you can do this part with super camou on you if you are kos or otherwise disliked there becaus you need no faction for Silox.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Cleansed Spirit of Kunark<br />
<br />
- Ulump Pujik, a named Froglok in Swamp of no Hope (north of the Froglok Village) tells you to give his own essence along with the 3 corrupted things to the gnome that hurts the land. Kill Ulump and loot his Essence. Ulump is a lvl 55 warrior that doubles for 250 and he has 32k hp. He can't be slowed or tashed. You should have 2 groups with 4-6  melee and 2-4 nukers (all as high lvl as possible) to kill him. Lure spells hit for full damage.<br />
<br />
- The 3 corrupted mobs of Kunark arethe Corrupted Gorilla (mid 40)in Emerald Jungle (root/dot him and stay far away. He has sow-speed and pops in the northern part of the plateau. Tottering Gorillas are PH of the tainted and only non-undead tainted will pop the corrupted), the Corrupted Barracuda (high 40,loc -900, -900) in Lake of ill Omen (only the blue tainted will pop the corrupted. Pull it on the land and kite him because root breaks fast. Would be much easier if you have a friend that helps you kill the corrupted) and the Dragon Faydedar that lives in the sea in Timorous Deep (easily soloable by a lvl 70 - used to need a full raid). <br />
<br />
- Hand the 4 items to the Gnome Nekexin Virulence in Overthere to get the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark. He can be found near the evil outpost at the water.<br />
<br />
<br />
The End<br />
<br />
- Hand the 3 Cleansed Spirits and the scimitar to Xanuusus the treant in North Karanas to receive the Nature Walker's Scimitar.<br />
<br />
All the parts that haven't mentioned how many poeple you need can be do solo.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

If you are in an Uberguild the only hard thing to get is Faydedar. The rest is cake and only a question of time if u have someone that can come fast to help you for a few parts.<br />

I killed the Corruptor once and made the most incredible mistake...was in DE form when I handed in last item to Ath. She basically said beat it.  So if what you're saying is correct then I cannot do this quest?  Or is it multiple times?  If so, is there a way to get faction back?<br />

I did the part with Faelin/Giz 5 times till I knew where the DE Corruptor spawns. After I killed the Corruptor I tried to do the part with Giz again because I still had a ring from Faelin (the 6th time that I found her). Giz ate my ring and told me that he has no business with me. So it seems that killing the DE Corruptor kills your faction with Giz.<br />
<br />
The other thing, giving Athele the coin DE form....u better should con her before. I bet she doesnt like you the same.<br />
<br />
to Felecia:<br />
<br />
You dont need faction with Uluump. Why should you? Just go and kick his ass to get the essence he drops.<br />
<br />
to Daveena:<br />
<br />
Just try and give him the pot. If you have enough faction with Alrik Farsight you should be ok with Farios too. They are both on Keepers of the Art faction. If he eats the pot it is no big loss. Just go to Chessboard island again and ask Alrik for a &quot;new&quot; one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feyn</div><div class="date">01-17-2001, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I write this summary in the hopes that it will aid you in your fight with<br />
Faydedar.  I do not claim that this is the only way to battle him.  I do<br />
hope that my advice will help improve your odds of being successful when he<br />
finally does spawn.  I would also like to thank those that have done such notable work in the initial research of our epic quest.<br />
<br />
I have been involved with four fights with the elusive Faydedar, and this is<br />
a compellation of what I have learned in those encounters.  If you have not<br />
yet printed yourself a map of Timorous Deep I strongly recommend you do<br />
before going any farther.  Next, I recommend that you have an &quot;assister&quot;<br />
available who can help you on short notice.  This person can be a fellow<br />
druid, a bard or a ranger.<br />
<br />
1) In every case the bait left at the spires at (approx) neg 12,200 pos<br />
4,200 (or the druid waiting) has been attacked.  It did not matter if the<br />
person was levitated at the top or sitting at the water line, or which arm<br />
of the spire s/he was sitting on.<br />
2) To successfully kite Faydedar you need to have as much resist magic and<br />
(secondary) resist fire gear on as you can muster.  Next you should have 6<br />
dummy buffs up, then RM, sow (or wolf form), and finally levitate.  If you<br />
are fortunate enough to have J-boots then put this buff up first and have it<br />
hot keyed.  Faydedar breathes an aoe debuff with fire and fear.  Make sure<br />
you are bound at the docks in Oasis.<br />
3) If you are sitting there with your druid go to step 6.<br />
4) Upon your bait dieing, pick up your assister and get to the succor in<br />
point (the chessboard).  Have the assister stand at the base of the hill<br />
that the Iksar master is on.  His job is to pick Faydedar up on tracking and<br />
intercept him if you are unable to find him.<br />
5) Look for Faydedar between the spires and the Raptor Islands.  He travels<br />
very slowly so if you start a grid pattern you should pick him up on track<br />
in short order.  If you fail to find him, no worries, your assister will<br />
pick him up on track eventually at the Iksar master.<br />
6) You now have Faydedar on track and in your sights.  There is no need to<br />
cast anything on him.  He will agro on you as soon as he is in range of you.<br />
Keep Faydedar on track at all times.  This will tell you if you have out ran<br />
him. (instead of being behind he'll start showing as behind left etc)  The<br />
chances are slim on this, but better to be safe then sorry.  Lead (kite :P )<br />
Faydedar to the elven island (neg 4,000, neg 6,000)  This is a bit of a run<br />
and takes a few minutes.  You want to kite him there as there are only elves<br />
on the island (non agro to you and Faydedar) and it has the largest open<br />
area for kiting.  Kite him only on the north-east side of the island in a<br />
nice oval loop.  At this point you only care about 2 of your buffs.  Keep up<br />
one dummy buff (something fast to cast like see invis) and either sow or<br />
wolf form.  If you are fortunate enough to have J-boots you don't need to<br />
keep any buffs up.  I have kited Faydedar in this manner for 7 hours with no<br />
trouble and no de-spawn.  (a fungi tunic also helps but is not necessary)<br />
7) While you are kiting your &quot;assister&quot; should be sitting at the elven<br />
docks.  His job is to sit there and cover incase you die, go LD, crash or<br />
what ever.  If for some reason you don't have an &quot;assister&quot; and die, you are<br />
bound at the docks in Oasis.  Zone back in and egress (succor).  I would<br />
recommend leaving a /dueled corpse at the egress point with 8 stacks of bat<br />
wings on it.  This allows you to loot one stack of bat wings, re-levitate,<br />
and go back to the spires - and back to step number four.  (Twice after<br />
dieing at the elven island (no comment about LD) Faydedar went back to the<br />
spires before resuming his normal journey)<br />
8) Fighting Faydedar:  Do NOT be mislead that Faydedar is easy to kill.  He<br />
is tougher then Nagafen.  Take at least five groups of people.  Make sure<br />
they are balanced and that you have some warriors 55 plus.  I have seen<br />
Faydedar wipe out 4 groups of people where half were lvl 55 plus and then<br />
poof.  I'm sure your guild is ub3r and l33t, but after spending X hundred<br />
hours camping him, do you want to have him wipe you out because the casters<br />
ping ponged him or something else stupid and poof?<br />
9) Get your friends, guildmates and whoever else you can to the succor<br />
point.  The fastest way into Timorous Deep is via the barge in Oasis.  Have<br />
your party meet at the chessboard, form groups and buff.  Their last buff<br />
should be levitate/dmf.  When they are fully buffed have them go due East to<br />
neg 6,000 neg 6,000 and meet at the large stone eagle.  It is easier for<br />
them to move to you then for you, or someone with levitate to try and kite<br />
him over to the chessboard.  As well, if you fight at the chessboard and<br />
loose he's 50 yards from the Iksar master L and you will have almost no<br />
chance of a second try.  If you do loose go back to step four.<br />
<br />
There it is.  I believe I've covered everything, though I'm sure someone<br />
will add to this.  I personally sat at the spires for 308 hours waiting for Faydedar.  In all, I spent 418 hours before I was finally able to complete the druid epic quest, and receive my epic weapon.  I have read others that completed it in a few days (cough), but would suggest that you can expect to spend some 'epic' time to complete this, probably<br />
around 200 hours.<br />
<br />
May Tunare guide you in your journey,<br />

I hadn't thought about doing my epic quest and I helped my best friend complete his ranger quest... we killed the DE corruptor of course. I cannot believe this would prevent me from doing my own epic. If so, I'm pretty disappointed. <br />
<br />
Guess the only thing I can do is attempt to do the quest up to that point. Is there anything that can be done to raise faction with Gix?</div></div><hr />

All you have to do is use wolfform.  I helped others do the corruptor part three times before taking the coin to Kithicor, and Giz X'Tin conned dubious to me in my normal wood elf form.  I wolfformed, and it took me up to indifferent, handed him the coin, and ran away from the reaver.  (many thanks to my guildmate Icestorm for telling me this)<br />

<br />
First, let me say thanks to Haro for this excellent post and to all those that have added their comments to it. :)<br />
<br />
I began my quest recently and would like to add a few comments about the DE Corrupter that may be of use to others.<br />
<br />
The night before I got the Corrupter, I was in EK while someone was doing him. The Corrupter and the two Reavers all /conned Yellow to me at level 44. So, they are not necessarily 48-50 as the summary suggests. The low end of the range could be as low as 45. In addition, the Reavers had Skeleton pets which makes them casters of some sorts (probably either SK or Necro). Shouldn't be a big deal since you don't have to kill them, just useful to know in case you were thinking about killing them. Also, the Corrupter is a caster. Not sure what class though as he wasn't casting anything on me when we took him down (the Paladin in the group took the brunt of all of the casting). One more thing to note when you get ready to do this. If Tarbul Earthstrider is up, his pathing takes him very near to the spawn point of the Corrupter. When I did it, it was Tarbul that forced us to zone after we killed the Corrupter.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps those who haven't done this part yet. :)<br />

Putting together my own groups not only got my epic done very quickly it also lessened the strain on all guild members.<br />
<br />
Here are the numbers I had for each part.   <br />
<br />
Cleansed Spirit of Antonica <br />
Corrupted Mammoth - Solo kill<br />
<br />
Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman - Solo Kill, use wolf form to solo pull the place holders out of the tower and on to land.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Hill Giant - Solo Kill<br />
<br />
Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer <br />
Corrupted Seahorse - 1 group minimum, I had 9 people including 2 clerics and an enchanter. I didn't have a &quot;heavy tank&quot; but I think a group consisting of a cleric, enchanter, warrior, monk, druid and another misc tank could do this one without a problem. The Sea Horse will complete heal itself so be prepared to stun him.  I had 2 clerics stunning him non stop and he still managed to complete heal himself about 3 times before going down.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Cyclops - 1 group, I was grouped with a wizzy, cleric, mage and druid between lvls 37 - 53. I think a group of 3 could handle this, a high level tank, cleric and of course druid.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Brownie - 3 people, 1 tank, cleric &amp; druid.<br />
<br />
Cleansed Spirit of Kunark <br />
Ulump Pujik  1 group if central tanking is done well, we did it by accident with 1 Warrior, 1 Ranger, 3 Clerics and myself. The second group didnt arrive until Ulump was almost running. Normally this is a 2 group kill as Wizzy Lures will land.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Gorilla  Can be soloed however its hard not to get a lot of adds with him.  It helps to have a second druid to root all the adds while you solo the corruptor.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Barracuda  Solo Kill, the most boring of them all. One place holder you kill over and over again on a 6 minute spawn.  Pull the tainted to land, if he won't follow you out of the water he won't spawn the corrupted version.<br />
<br />
Dragon Faydedar  4 6 groups usually for the spawned version of Fay.   Central tanking is critical to do it without a lot of deaths.  MR &amp; FR should be at least 90 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Elaborate scimitar<br />
Foraged Items - If your foraging skill isn't high then map it to a movement key so that you forage automatically to work on the skill. Even with a high foraging skill this may take you awhile. I tormented bats for 5 hours in Misty while foraging for that item.<br />
<br />
City of Mist  Reavers can be done with one good group. I have done one group with a warrior (lvl 60), ranger, druid, cleric, wizzy and rogue.  I took in 1 1/2 groups for the trip which resulted in my JR. <br />
<br />
Venril Sathir Remains  2 high level group kill.  <br />
<br />
I followed the guild on EQ druids almost the entire way, extremely easy to follow and very complete.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

Within about 5 hours, I had foraged all my rares, gotten my speckeled powder, and completed all the steps right up to the DE Corruptor.  Btw, foraging my rares was incredible.  I got 2 of them as my first forage, and the other 2 within 5 minutes each.  The FV flower took the longest, with 45 minutes of foraging.<br />
<br />
I was simply amazed that I had accomplished so much in such a short amount of time.  I only see the jade reaver holding me back.  I can camp the spirits at my leisure.<br />

All in all, I have no complaints, and the horror stories I have heard have not affected me at all.<br />

This is a one-group easy kill if you keep two things in mind -- or a big CR if you don't:<br />
<br />
If you don't have 100+ unbuffed MR/FR, don't even think about going along. You won't be a help, you'll be a hindrance.<br />
<br />
If you don't have an instant junk-buff clickie, don't go. You'll be feared and dispelled and if you don't die, you will take up healer time that could be better spent on the MT.<br />
<br />
If your entire group does have those things, Fay will die easily.  You'll barely know you were in a fight.  If not, you're going to be doing CR.  I would recommend that if you do this with a single group that no one be under level 56.  This will help on resists, especially resisting fear.  The smallest in our group was 57.  Classes: war, clr, enc, wiz, mnk, dru.<br />
<br />
My monk was all set for raiding with resists and clickies, but my druid was not. She did have 100 unbuffed MR/FR, but no clickie (oops!). She was dispelled and feared and ended up only contributing very slightly to the kill. She spent most of the time healing herself with only a couple token heals tossed to the wizzy who either wasn't resisting or had drawn a little agro (and really wasn't in all that much death danger). Everyone else had resists and clickies. Everyone else resisted all fears and nearly all AEs. Fay is AC soft-capped below 1200 AC; my monk drew agro for a while and the hits were all near-minimum -- so small I didn't notice for about 5-6 rounds.  I was watching HP bars on druid's screen to do healing and thought it was just a partial AE resist doing the damage. Only cold-based spells hit Fay -- 65 enc could not slow her or land any magic-based spells even after tash'ing.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that if I was more skilled at double boxing and had more base resists plus a clickie for the druid, I could have duo'd Fay with just the monk and the druid.  I don't think a druid could solo Fay with a DC'd pet and TR.  No clickie on the pet means all buffs will be dispelled.  Even if the pet was not feared, the AE and melee will likely hit for full damage -- that's likely more than 2800 hp/12s.  It would all depend on the druid and the pet resisting all fear and the druid resisting all the AEs.  Feared pet would mean dead druid.</div></div><hr />

Fortunately the GM gave me mine back, since I lost them right after we killed the Gobbie Shammie.<br />

What _is_ the appropriate level?  Is TWT supposed to respond to hails and such?  Would this be a leading indicator?</div></div><hr />

Well I did it with 185 Magic Resistance and 197 Fire resistance. His fire proc never hit me but he dispelled 6 of my buffs so apparently you need a lot more thatn 100 MR. Heck I did this with a 65 Pally and 65 Rogue. Both of them were over 440 MR and they both got debuffed at least once each.<br />
<br />
Oh and to show you just how easy this has become we killed him in about 45 seconds and I never cast a single spell. The two melees killed him by themselves. The Rogue was at 100% and the Pally was at 65% at the end of the fight. Fey ran away like a girl at 19% health. LOL</div></div><hr />

Magic Resistance helps you keep from being feared, but it will not help you with dispells/debuffs.  That is why most guides recommend that you fill your first 6 slots with junk buffs first like See Invis, Endure Disease, etc.<br />
Also, you do need to be in melee range of Fay for your spells to land.</div></div><hr />

Ulump went down easily with a 65 bard, 65 monk and 65 cleric. The corrupteds spawned very easily and relatively quickly when I used the information at http://www.eqdruids.com and Faydedar was taken out by a 65 bard, 65 rogue, and 65 druid. I've seen full guilds wipe with Faydedar, so imagine my absolute shock when I sat by watching 3 friends of mine take him out in under 2 minutes!!!<br />

1) CHing Seahorses in Kedge are charmable and fun to have<br />
2) Used a 65 ranger, 65 bard (for resist song only), and 55 cleric for faydedar<br />
3) There IS a turn-in to pop Faydedar, but I'm not sure who and what</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chubbexul Demonsbane</div><div class="date">05-05-2004, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK heres my 2cp, gonna give some info that I can remember.  JUSTGOT MY EPIC LAST NIGHT So here goes.  <br />
<br />
1. To spawn Fay you need to speak to the dwarf on the Island in TD all the way on the bottom of the map. To get to this island you need to swim throuh 2 underwater tunnels which are clearely marked on out maps by two lines on the border of the island.<br />
The first tunnel leads you within the fist layer and the 2nd Tunnel will lead u to the dwarf. (Trust me its confusing now, but once your there your like OH YA!!!)<br />
<br />
2. I did the faydedar first with me 63druid, and my brother 65sk, and 5 guildies, 65clr,sk,mag,ench, wiz.(No elem gear). Took about 50 seconds. NOTE: as per his AE debuff He did not debuff in order we were all getting debuffed but different buff slots at different times, For me i was debuffed in this order buff slot 1, 4.5, 7.9. I mainly casted Harmony on the SK, and Faydedar would debuff that buff only. (great Strategy)<br />
<br />
3. On the Seahorse. Did this with me63dru, 64.wiz and 61 wiz, had no problem. as matter of fact we found her in a cave with another seahorse and i was able to keep the add rooted throughout the 2 min fight. She was only able to CH once.<br />
<br />
4.On the Veniril sathir fight, after we spawned it we took it down very easy with 2 groups 1 mid lvl50's group and 1 lvl65's group. Just keep tank runed and drop those nukes.<br />
<br />
5. Corrupted Gorillas were no problem for me either. I had myself  63dru, 61rang,65sk,61druid, 61 wiz. what we did was set up camp on the coordinates that is in the guide. and we the 3 of us just tracked and brought all the tottering gorrillas we could find to camp at the same time. the sk along with the wiz took care of them all. at one point there was 4 back at camp and with wizzys ae and mine we tore them apart.<br />
<br />
6. Corrupted Baracuda. HERES SOME ADVICE. when you first set up camp. Track all the PH barracudas that are on track and when u find it mark on your map the spot. I found 4 ph spots. What i did was me and 65sk just ran in circles from spot to spot and killed them. He went one direction I went the other within 1 hour 2 tainted spawned one not being the one that spawned the corrupted and the other one did.<br />
<br />
7. oh the Ulump in Swamp of NO HOPE. i had 2 groups. mostely melee and 2 wizzys and 1 cleric and myself. All I can say about this fight is wow he has alot of HP. Took us forver but we got him. The only think to worry about here is the add I got. Dulak or something like that was his name. Though he was green to me at lvl63 I couldnt land one single spell on him or ulump. so i had to kite him a bit while  they killled ulump then they killed him.<br />
<br />
8. Corrupted hill Giant. This was a joke, just go into rathe mountains and set up shop on the hill that spawns Cylops.(track if anything) and just keep /ooc Looking for Tainted Hill Giant please send tell. and just wait around till he spawns. Had to do this twice do to the first time i destroyed the Ancient rock by accident. both times the tainted spawned within 15 mins. best to do this on a busy day when people are farming them, you will be surprised how helpful people are when u tell them its for your epic<br />
<br />
9. One last thing on Faydedar DO NOT SIT DOWN DURING FIGHT or USE ANY EMOTES. you will gain immediate aggro and die.<br />
<br />
thats it im no expert but this was my experience hope it helps</div></div><hr />

 <br />
- Athele in East Karanas can be found near the river just north of the barbarian fisher village. Give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. Give this amulet<br />
to Sionae (spawns -2300, -930), then to Nuien (spawns -3650, -300) and finaly to Teloa (spawns -3800, -2860). The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkelf Reavers (I think all about lvl 48 to 50) to spawn on top of the hill east of the river(loc -1500, -1000). Don't start this part until you are ready to kill the DE Corruptor because all the druids except Athele are triggerd spawns. So don't start giving around the amulet and stop at the last stage. You need luck to meet the full druid gathering after another druid or ranger did that part successfully.<br />
 <br />
- Find the Corruptor and kill him fast on the hill north of the river (loc -1500, -1000). He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You dont needto kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and loot the tome. The best way is to have one or two friends on the hill that can start fearkiting him. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele spawns again in about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring<br />
this to &quot;she who walks the land in service blabla...&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
I did a horrible thing.  I started the whole giving chain and when my friends were not available I stopped before I gave the Amulet to Teloa.  Teloa is the one that triggers the spawning of the corruptor.  Now I can not find Teloa.  <br />
 <br />
What must I do to get back on track for the epic??</div></div><hr />

Have another druid (who has their epic) restart the quest for you (assuming that's possible).<br />
<br />
I know I did the quest up to the EK part, then did the turnin, kicking off the script, for a friend to do.  Then I redid the early parts.  So it should be possible to restart.<br />
<br />
Let me clarify...  I had read that if you failed the EK part, you'd have to start over.  So many people were keeping two versions of the coin going, as long as you never tried to have them be the same version.  So you yourself should be able to restart the quest with the guy in BW.  Those early steps are cake anyway.<br />
