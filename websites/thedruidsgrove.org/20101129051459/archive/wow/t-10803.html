<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azurath</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering whats the best counter vs other classes in either straight up pvp duels and melee situations. I'm not sure if there is another topic about this but I cant seem to find one. Yet by lvl 30 here are my experiences.<br />
<br />
Warriors-Easy<br />
I beat with catform just shred through them...just stay behind their backs while attacking them. Warrior I dueled seemed like a nub so perhaps they aren't that bad. Another one I played bear, stunned him and healed and just meleed him , basically outlasting him<br />
<br />
Mage-Easy<br />
Continously rush em, dont let em breath and overwhelm them with melee. Beat a few mages, they dont seem to be solo pvpers...<br />
<br />
Rogue-Medium<br />
Fairie fire, and bear form are a must to offset their fast dps. Also Farie fire effects their stealth. I lost to a former rank 14 hunter a few times to figure this out and overcame him...just once but he was higher lvl ^_^<br />
<br />
Paladin-Hard<br />
I beat a paladin in a duel but barely. I think the key is to save your stun for that crucial moment before they can heal themselves. Paladins love to stun you when you heal as well..The key is to reverse this and stun them instead and dont let them outlast you. Also instead of backing off, put them on defensive by being crazy and rushing them...then stun that heal <br />
<br />
Warlock-Very Hard<br />
I dueled one at lvl 20 and he was 23 or 24 or so but I got beat up pretty bad...I was rooted and his succubus (rogue?) pet beat me up...No idea how to beat in 1 v 1 but I think he had bout 60-70% hp at the end...Not sure how to deal with them<br />
<br />
Hunter-Very Hard<br />
I dueled a 25 hunter around 23....I lost but i'm thinking as the spells to negate pets become more effective they are too...Just shapeshift out of movement impairments and it should be possible to rush em...<br />
<br />
Shaman-Hard??<br />
Never dueled a shaman but I hear they are difficult... <br />
<br />
Druid-Random<br />
Just as druids are random so are the duels hehe<br />
<br />
What i'd like to really know is which form against which classes are best? Does shapeshift remove root? I'm suprised I played so well without knowing that shapeshift removes movement impairments...I only got that much better as I figured it out (was kinda slow on that one o.o;) <br />
<br />
The people i've dueled so far have been higher lvl than me cept the paladin which was a lvl below me. Please dont put in an argument of player skill and ability. Speak as if I was a rank 14  pvper. Forgive me if I sound overconfident and arrogant-My excuse is i'm a nub and most nubs think they are pro's while they completely suck, but I'd like to improve myself at a rapid pace as well =)<br />
<br />
Btw-I've noticed that movement impairments are a pvp favorite, people love to kite you.<br />
<br />
Oh one more- When i'm rooted I like to moonfire and cast regen/heal on myself till it wears off but this doesnt seem very mana efficient against a nuking caster. What do you guys do to counter this<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading my post ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a second note, I wouldnt be worrying this early in the game. I think you said you were only lvl 23? At lvl 60, the game changes and gear makes the fights 10x harder. I can own another class in similar gear but when they have tier 2s almost any class can 2shot you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cobra13e</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple suggestions/ideas:<br />
<br />
Paladins - set a key with Rank 1 Healing Touch. If you think they will stun you, use this spell (saves mana) - pop the larger heal afterwards and watch him cry. (Also effective for other interrupt moves - shield bash, Kick, etc).<br />
<br />
Hunters - still have a dead zone as far as i know.  Sleep the pet, root the hunter, stand in the dead zone and Wraith,Moonfire to death.(Dead Zone is too far for melee, but too close for most ranged attacks - Hunter's Scatter Shot can work from 2yds +, so you can still get hit by this attack).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">07-09-2006, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lorath is right, things change alot at 60.  I'd agree, level'n up mages and warriors were cake... at 60, an elemental Mage with Imp Counter Spell and good +fire or ice gear is a beast.  Warriors with end-game two handers and a good anti-druid strat are also more troublesome for non-moonkins.<br />
<br />
One tip that'll help you beat rogues more reliably is feral charge... charge'm, get them in the 6 second root, keep moving through them and root them or heal.  I also do that to warriors.<br />
<br />
Oh one more- When i'm rooted I like to moonfire and cast regen/heal on myself till it wears off but this doesnt seem very mana efficient against a nuking caster. What do you guys do to counter this?<br />
<br />
Shifting form breaks roots... it's only an issue vs. Mages and Druids.  Basically I'll let the situation dictate what I do.  In general it's a matter mana conservation... sometimes I have mana to blow and shift without pause, other times I'll take the hit if I'm already in feral (particularly bear) and charge once root drops.  I've rooted druids before just to force a shift and make'm waste mana... it's a situational call like so many things.<br />
<br />
Just so you have something to look foward to.... Dire Bear destroys hunters.  In general I almost always beat hunters, I'd say at 60 they're the easiest kills for me... even if sometimes it takes awhile.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a mixxed bag depending on spec, as long as they don't significantly out gear me I generally win the duels.  Good resto shaman are a pain in the ass...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some tips. <br />
Equip your insignia-trinket (it's worth it - promise).<br />
Equip Shadow Reflector if you can (Skilled warlocks don't fall for it usually as you get a big graphic over your head, but its still a shadow-immunity for 5 secs).<br />
If you want to heal - stun the felhunter.<br />
If he tosses fear and you have everything on cooldown - go cheetahform (if you are lucky - you will run out of range from the shadowbolt that follows - its a longshot, but it CAN happen) =)<br />
<br />
All other classes are pretty much cake except shadow priests and skilled spellordins. =)<br />
<br />
Oh.. and hunters becomes more easy if you get the talent natures focus. They are not that hard w/o it also imo. But all hunters are tricky bastards and shouldnt be taken lightly. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shattershot is a real bane as Free Action doesn't block it and the Insignia of the Alliance doesn't get rid of it, so I end up wandering around in a daze for a good few seconds whilst they start to shoot (and crit) me. Their armour seems huge in that set and as for their pets, I don't know if it is the type of pet or a specific ability, but their pets are immune to hibernate (roots generally not an option as the hunters are usually left to guard and trap the flag).<br />
<br />
Geared warlocks also seem to toast me (I'm only in the blue PvP set) :( Most other classes I do well at.</div></div><hr />

Try this: Feral druid with insane armor and nature's grasp. 2+ spellordin running behind him tossing blessing of freedom and all that **** (they have to be pretty skilled, you cant just pick up some paladin and try he gets it as he's prolly a critadin/loladin).<br />
<br />
Our WSG team totally annihilated the horde equalent with this strategy. Really! Their pvp-leader acctually mailed us an said he liked our strat and he hoped we wouldnt tell it to other pvp teams (oops! :p).. WSG is a alli-friendlty Bg tbh.. we have paladins. Too bad paladins usually suck d!ck tho. :/<br />
<br />
Some tips as a runner in theese setups (i bet they've been told before, but it cant hurt to tell them again). =)<br />
<br />
1. Always communicate whatever you do. (click on the map when ever you can- where you are going/running. Really, it helps even your team enormously even if they have good info.. it doesnt hurt to click infront of where you are running to telling them &quot;I'm gonna be HERE in the next few seconds!&quot;. I've gotten many whispers from ppl telling me it helps that they dont have to look at the minimap all the time and just follow me clicks. =)<br />
<br />
2. If you are running with the flag tell what route you are taking BEFORE you start running. Like, &quot;GY = Gravyard&quot; &quot;R= ramp (opposite graveyard), &quot;T= tunnel&quot; or something like that. Ofc this doesnt work all the time as sometimes you have to improvise when people counter you.. but still.. it makes your team a rough point to rendezvous.<br />
<br />
3: Charge people in front of you. It happens all the time.. they demount and start casting some nasty spell just infront of you running path. Charge em! Not only do you get closer to your goal, you get to /lol at them. ;)<br />
<br />
4. Always work as a team. WSG is a total and undesputed TEAM effort. Going solo-killing ppl in the middle sucks tbh. =)<br />
<br />
This has prolly been told before, I just had to resay it. =)s</div></div><hr />

I always wondered if locks were tough if it's because they tend to be played by your more experienced players and the % of first time players tend to not choose warlock as their first toon......along with their equip, spells/talents, and that annoying blob which beats you senseless.</div></div><hr />

So that's not true.....the funny thing is the 'lock was the easiest class for me to play with starting out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lvl 60 any class has potential to beat you but the class that beats a druid 999 of 1000 times is a warlocks. Even crap geared at lvl60 is nearly impossible to beat coz of the fear, dots and reseting spells abilities.<br />
<br />
Easiest to kill is mage, they are no match. Same for rogues unless they get first strike then ur prolly die coz of their 50 stun abilities.</div></div><hr />

I sort of regret engineering alot of the time, and miss alchemy, but it does help vs. a warlock. If I get the jump on a Warlock, it's with a quick Ravage + 1-2 pt FB, and unleashing my Mithril Dragonling on him before the fear. Engineering pets that delay their casting and dish some damage while you're feared make a world of difference. Without a pet I'd expect to loose even getting the jump on a lock. Of course I'd try anyway... builds character (unless it was a long run from the GY).</div></div><hr />

Even tier 3 locks are at your mercy. :) (hey, they play an EZMODE class, they can seldom PvP well when someone interuppts their plan ;))</div></div><hr />
