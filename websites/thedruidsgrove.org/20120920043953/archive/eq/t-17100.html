I have used it on light blue mobs few times and it makes them pets, but the pets don't do anything. There is no pet window either. Is it just for fun or meant to be used as some kind of mezz? Is there cap to what level mobs it works on?</div></div><hr />

It has a time limit as well. Considering our normal charmed pets are far superior to these &quot;pets&quot;, then I have to agree with Wildeagle. It's useless for the most part.</div></div><hr />

Didn't buy it got it off a gnoll in BB a week or so ago. From what I read on it I probably will not use it though I am one of those that need to have every spell on me that is available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klath</div><div class="date">01-20-2009, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you cast Carve Whistle you get a whistle that you can click on to summon a pet that uses the same model as whatever animal you have targeted.   It does not charm the animal or even aggro it, it just makes a level 78(?) pet that looks like the animal (if you zone it will revert to the bear model).  The pet seems to last about 20 minutes or so before it disappears.  The pet will only attack something that attacks you and that's about the extent of the control you have over it.  You can buff it and arm it as you can with any summoned pet. <br />
<br />
  I haven't parsed its DPS but it's a small fraction of what a mob of the same level would dish out even with haste and buffs.  I'm just guessing but it's probably in the same DPS ballpark as a shaman pet.  Probably less.<br />
<br />
The spell that the whistle casts (Soothing Call (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=18544)) is outdoor only but you can summon the pet outdoors and then zone indoors with it.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, atleast nice to know pet lasts even when zoning, that's a plus, if I ever want to play with this :) Thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drood</div><div class="date">01-31-2009, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty much situational useage on this. Can confirm it lasts 20/30 mins. Max hit from what I've seen is 138, think it's either level 79/80 Carve Whistle II that is, fairly certain it's 80, so should dual weild, quad perhaps.<br />
 When I'm using this, I try to get hit at least once early in a fight then backup or whatever to loose agro. It would have been better if this pet would also attack on command, but it is what it is.. Merc's will buff them, haste and other spells will work on them just like any other pet. Will try to parse next time I use one. field of scale, I like to use the small blackbird model, but other than looks makes no real diff, except birds normally have a lev already. Had a skelly jump me when i went past a tree, was hiding behind it, pet lasted long enough for me to exodus outta danger, so was worth a few secs to get this summoned. Will also fit in potion belt, has 5 charges. Was also tanking an animal in Old Commonlands, and clicked whistle, and it did summon from the animal that was whooping on me, that was a bit of a suprise.</div></div><hr />

You can actually tell the carve whistle pet to attack.  I know this was not the case before,  you can also have it guard or sit,   so it won't follow you around. Unless you have been hit however,  it will not attack,  you do have to tell it to attack,  but at least that is a major change to the spell itself.  To me that makes this a bit more usefull spell.</div></div><hr />

I must have gotten it after the window change.  <br />

The tree snake pet is just too cute...it's so tiny I mostly see a name running around behind me.  :wink:</div></div><hr />
