Hi All,<br />
<br />
Any advice on equipment would be much appreciated.  I'm in a small family style guild and only very occasionally have the chance to raid.<br />
<br />
There are some pretty obvious areas for upgrading, such as the tunic and the leggings, suggestions?  Also I have been trying to get a handle on my augments and spell foci.  Limited funds (40k) here so the OOW tradeskilled augs are pretty much out of reach?  I have a few DON Crystals (350) and could buy more....<br />
<br />
Also, I am wondering if I should just wait things out until the new expansion and save up for upgrades then, especially once lvl 70+ augs are released into the market!?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your comments!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
In the long run if you want cheap upgrade go for grandmaster's tradeskill gears. My sense is that they won't become obselete because they have 3 aug slots. <br />
 <br />
Do tradeskill trophy quest in freeport -- easy at your skill level.<br />
 <br />
Raise tailoring to 250 -- check out http://mboards.eqtraders.com/eq/showthread.php?t=25961 . Need to farm some corathus tails from CC. Somewhat painful.<br />
 <br />
Have appropriate tradeskill AAs -- this is easy. <br />
 <br />
Farm for glossy drake hide -- painful. Rare drop in DON missions only.<br />
 <br />
Then you can make your own set of GM's gear+symbol, and even sell the products for profit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">07-25-2006, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM combines have intrinsic failure rate, hence at skill 250 with geerlok and the tailoring master AA, you are capped in success rate for making them. This is a good news since you don't need to train tailoring to 300. <br />
 <br />
Expect some vary upset moments when you fail a combine, but once you successfully make one piece, it sells for a lot of plats.<br />
 <br />
Forgot to mention that you need to get a GM tailoring mission in your hometown and kill/loot something in DON missions as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WiLdOnE786</div><div class="date">07-25-2006, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see you've done some of the relic/arcstone quests ( the cloak and the aug) You might want to consider doing http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3396 as a ring quest.<br />
And http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3412 for an earring.<br />
Also, doing spell missions is a great alternative for gear and getting the spells for it.<br />
Your 55 aura is a nice little spell to have also.. It's a quest in Takish Hiz.<br />
70 spell from laboratory and skins are easy-ish to obtain, not sure on how good druid spells are, as mines still 64, but they should be okay.<br />
 <br />
Spirit marks in arcstone: They provide decent gear, but if you get a group for them, you'll risk rolling on them and losing. I've been using these to twink out my alts.<br />
Bazaar: If you see something that might be an upgrade, buy it.. If you don't have enough, i just target out my gimpest slot, and hunted untill i had enough money to buy it.</div></div><hr />
