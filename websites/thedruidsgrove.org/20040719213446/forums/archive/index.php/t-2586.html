<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Bah, guess we need some pre-8/26 parses too, to verify.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Swarming has been 7 ticks worth since inception (although it was never proved until DoT text feedback)  and Nature Walker's is 3 minute duration = 30 ticks, to hit 31 times means the extra 1 is still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gael Stormracer</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the REAL change is that splurt-type spell damage only increases for as many ticks as they 'originally' did (that is to say, before the damage on moving mobs was reduced to 2/3 and an extra tick of duration was added). In these spells, the damage done by the spell starts off small but keeps increasing till it wears off. The Shaman Epic is this type - as is Splurt itself (necros). The parse on the Shaman thread shows that the damage on the last 2 ticks is the same. This probably meant that when we had Extended Affliction, the damage was even greater than that, but this probably only got spotted when DoT damage reporting went in.</div></div><hr />
