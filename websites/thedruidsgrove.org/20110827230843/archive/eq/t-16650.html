I can't say I'm too sad to see the bobbing done away with, but it does seem like it's going to be a bit difficult to tell when I'm levitating unless/until they implement some sort of visual cue that is a little more obvious than a buff icon (with so many buff icons it could get old looking for a buff icon to make sure I have lev on).  <br />
 <br />
How does everyone else feel about the &quot;bobless&quot; lev?</div></div><hr />

I do, however, think the change is long overdue.  Many players, particularly within a raid setting, should see monumental improvements with framerate and rendering.<br />
<br />
I remember PvP in Drunder back in 2002 with about 140 people in zone contesting the RZtWL event (and just about everyone levitating).  Omg, it was awful somethin fierce.</div></div><hr />

But, these changes should be interesting to see if they got rid of some of the exploits, like Amulet of Necropotence bug, as well as some of the &quot;climbing&quot; bugs. But alas, Shorties will be hit pretty hard with this change, it should be quite difficult to climb areas like kael steps, Rcod, Tower of Sol Ro, and areas like that. The camera bob is a good idea, not actually bobbing, but, the camera does. Another suggestion similar to how they added the zoning text, but, a small stationary text, as long as the effect it up, stating you are levitating would help as well.<br />
<br />
Some of the interesting things they should do on test is enable Lev in non Lev areas, like Siren's, Velk's(would keep it's non lev feature for fun factor anyways), Airplane, Potorment, and see what is possible to exploit, whether to decide if it would be possible to remove some of those restrictions, or you know for further changes.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of a player option to have it on or off.</div></div><hr />

I've found myself getting &quot;seasick&quot; on my warrior and rogue, if I can't find some levi somewhere. I would LOVE to see a feature that allowed player choice, even if it was just the camera bobbing, so it wouldn't lag other people.<br />
