<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">10-05-2006, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMFG!! That was so f'in funny. I imagined most of the people were exactly like they protrayed in last nights episode. They did a good job with the play style and how SOME people act.<br />
The monotone voices when getting their gear together and the battles had me rolling in the floor. My wife even asked if that was what people who play that game are like and I HAD to answer YES!!! I have little experience with groups but when I did get into one the leader talked just like Cartmen did. Man that was one of the funniest episodes...my fav part was when Cartmen got diarrhea and his mom just brought him a bed pan so he could keep playing (imagine a bigger, pimple faced, more disgusting Cartmen blowing ass all over his mom as he is giving raid instructions to Kenny, Kyle and Stan in the SAME room).<br />
Ya, I know I don't usually watch it but I heard what the topic was and I couldn't resist. Any comments you guys can share about it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">10-05-2006, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general I'm not a fan of southpark, but I do like a few episodes as well as the movie they made so I had to watch it last night.  It was very good.  The sword of 1,000 truths, held on this 1 gig flash drive... classic.  &quot;We can't trust the sword of 1,000 truths to a noob!&quot; Another good line.  It fits perfectly with the times.  &quot;A player has grown so strong that he can kill our admins&quot;  That actually happened in EQ once when a Admin let down his god mode guard.  Overall a good episode.  I'm going to try and find it for my i-pod in a few days.</div></div><hr />

I am not really a fan of Southpark but I will likely watch this episode.</div></div><hr />

I loved how they kept saying lines like, &quot;this is the end of the world!!... *pause*.... of warcraft!&quot;  Great little gems of humor like that is what I like about southpark, the stuff that's real easy to miss yet obviously put in for a reason.  Not sure what my favorite part was, it was all just great.</div></div><hr />
