<br />
Often we will create a thread looking for feedback from our community.<br />
<br />
It helps keeps us #1  (http://www.itallbeginshere.com/index.php)<br />
(Leave comments while your there)<br />
<br />
So what we are looking for is Feedback from you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 News being updated to your satisfaction?<br />
 Forums working Fast?<br />
 Errors being taken care? (use the bug section!)<br />
 Email responses from the staff quick?<br />
 Hows the Art.. does it represent both Horde and Alliance Druids?<br />
 Do we need a Seperate Talent Section or should we just merge it with the Spell Section (to many forums is a BAD thing).<br />
 Avatar's - How do they look? &quot;TDG Avatars&quot;<br />
We need Feedback so our community stays Number 1 in both your eyes and when someone ask you.. hey is there a Druid site out there? We want you to have Pride in telling them about The Druids Grove and your community - <br />
<br />
What you believe we can improve upon?<br />
<br />
What do you like about the site?<br />
<br />
VERY IMPORTANT!<br />
The key to bringing new people to our community is word of mouth and posting links in signatures. Blizzard Official Boards currently has a thread that we need feedback from &quot;you&quot; to those looking for a community. -  (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-druid&amp;t=147859)For some reason people believe that our board here is a combination (all mixed up in the same forum) of EQ, EQ2 and WoW mixed. As you know thats simply untrue; and that rumor needs to be dispelled. The software is seperate (purchased seperately) and under a Subdomain (as is all the others) and the only thing they do share is the UserName Database so you don't have to sign up on each board - that be a total hassle!<br />
<br />
Thank Rahj and guice for creating that monster.<br />
<br />
I am actual off for the next couple days from my real job because I just under went surgery so pain killers are my friends. But I want to consentrate on promoting our community to the large population of druids. Quite Frankly I need your Help! <br />
<br />
Suggestions:<br />
If you post on the WoW Official Forums:<br />
Add to your signature<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glyss</div><div class="date">04-22-2005, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for more freedom. It's great when discussions get hot, but its hard to say anything confrontational in a thread without at least 2-3 admins jumping in and saying to keep it civil. Debate should not always be civil and as long as it doesn't get out of hand with cussing and flaming, I see no reason why we SHOULD keep it civil. If a poster calls out another poster, the other poster should be responsible for defending himself. There is no reason to enforce people to stay on topic because the best conversation usually starts when people start going off topic. I don't think we need to sit around like English women sipping tea with our legs crossed dicussing a topic politely. If someone gets mad at someone else's post, they should be alowed to express it as long as they support it with evidence and it isn't just a rambling flame.<br />
<br />
On a different note, I love the Mods here and how they contribute to most of the dicussions. I have never seen Mods so interactive with the community as I have here. I love the atmosphere and I have nothing major to complain about, my statement above is really only an annoyance I have. Keep up the good work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">04-22-2005, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets review:<br />
<br />
1.) http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=8564&amp;page=1<br />
<br />
Was it because we didn't want you to talk about potion and duels or was it because of the name calling. - Name of thread: &quot;The &quot;overpowered&quot; druid&quot; <br />
<br />
Okay this thread I was actual going to respond to last night but wanted to see if it matured first; apparently it did not- Overall it was a good thread till the name calling which is a big no no.<br />
<br />
My Response (I saved it just incase) Duel Rules are set pre-fight - If someone just pops up a Duel then anything goes they can suck on my ro.. Staff if they have a problem with it. <br />
<br />
As for Gentleman or Lady duels.. those that are for fun.. Most will say No Pots.. if one breaks those rules.. Make the Statement - Rules have been broken! I deny you the right for a satisfactory Fight and will take my death in satisfaction that your Honor has been forfeited. Of course this doesn't help much in Honor Points. Wish there was an option/rule set where PoTs would not be clickable.<br />
<br />
PVP however there should be No rules since its using what ever you got either out of Inventory (your brain) or inventory (weapons, pots, trinkets, gear) etc. I went Alchemy and First Aid for a reason and this being one of them.<br />
<br />
A Duel between two people is to test each others wits and gear.. Pots are either bought or made and doesn't take a genius to click on them.<br />
<br />
PVP battles are just that Person(s) Vs. Person(s) IE: Horde Against &lt;st1 =&quot;&quot;&gt;:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:city w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Alliance&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1&gt;:place&gt; (or vice versa) and I seen some tactics including baiting (HEPL! &quot;You look and see an Alliance Member getting attacked.. so you turn to help them! - Suddenly the Alliance Member is &quot;Gone&quot; - and your left to deal with not only the One Horde Member but 3 of his buddies that were over the hill waiting for you to respond.) &quot;can you say GANKED!?&quot; <br />
<br />
As for this thread.. <br />
<br />
Its not PVP - so treat it accordingly and gentleman/ladylike rules do apply so if you can't draw a picture as suggested by one of the members and you can't explain it another way or Ask the question.. &quot;Do you understand what I am saying though you may not agree?&quot; -<br />
<br />
Thank you for your considerate posting and respect for your fellow community members! Without these rulesets.. you might find yourself getting GANKED!<br />
<br />
- Everyone is entitled to their opinions even if they don't agree with your own. Each person has different views on such matters and some are a bit more passionate about those views.. just don't get blinded by your own passion!<br />
<br />
--- As for ignoring the request by the Mods/Administrators.. or the actual owner of the site.. lets just not go there.. IE: don't test the lines.. I have the ultimate BFG and I try not to use it because its a bitch to clean. /sarcasm but trying for a bit of light humor instead of a stuffy Nazi type Admin Post!<br />
<br />
It might be best for Mods to post in Red to separate - Mod/Admin Duties vs joining the conversation, we are community members first. This may help the community members hear our plea's of hey.. Dont let this thread dwindle to whoever has the bigger .. Staff .. Its a good conversation other then the staff sizes. ;)2.) http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=8668<br />
<br />
<br />
  <br />
Went to the Ruins which means its still open(you have posted since). Name of thread &quot;Druids vs Shamans&quot;<br />
<br />
Overall it seemed to be an arguement between two people and well his brother? - Anyhow the community several times inserted comments including several mods that responded. Overall it seems to say.. I have a bigger... .. er STAFF then you! and the other guy responding &quot;No.. I do!&quot; Rants.. though I will tell you this much you actual tried to push the conversation back on target but unfortunately BAGMiester was resistant to your Druid Mind Tricks and brought in reinforcements namely his bro response .. which is okay just means he's a mouth piece. (your my hero!) Dude! - Ignore feature works well on this board btw!<br />
<br />
And Bag if your reading this.. I am just calling it like it is.. no direct insult here; if you feel your opinion counts thats okay but don't be name calling no matter how you feel.. just means you have nothing left to support your comments and quite frankly means you should leave it as is and let other people judge your statements. Name calling just means you have nothing left but to attack at a personal level which means you lose and unfortunately drag the post down with it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">04-25-2005, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ultimately, you have the benefit of me being the sort of bottom line on posts on the WoW Boards, those who know me from the EQ side over the years know I'm absolutely not opposed to heated debate.  <br />
<br />
But (you knew there was going to be a but ;)), keep the insults to a minimum.  A discussion which devolves to nothing more than salvos of &quot;Poopy-head&quot; &quot;Dillweed&quot; are pointless.  <br />
<br />
The Grove also is the kind of place that gives warnings before taking hard action.  If you see a Mod post something in the thread...thats a warning.  If one of the Admins shoot you a PM...thats a more serious warning (and please respond to the PM, we hate being ignored).<br />
<br />
And yes, threads which get rantish...will be relegated to the rants forum.  On the other hand...I encourage people to read the rant forum regularly.  I remember on the EQ side, for a good year and more, the best forum on the boards was the rant forum.  We had some good, highly technical, discussions there over the years, but discussions which produces some heated arguments.</div></div><hr />
