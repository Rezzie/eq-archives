Also, I understand this is coming out in July and some places are quoting an Aug/Sept date for EQ2. That seems to be pushing it quite a bit.<br />

<br />
I have heard that Omens is the second half of GoD.  I already paid for GoD.  If they are gonna start releasing parts of updates and charge $30 or more for each part... I have a nice little savings account that would better use the cash for my niece.</div></div><hr />

I'm not buying this until I hear there are places for soloing or for two players groups to go, unlike GoD. It is our own cricumstance, but my wife and I still largely just play together because it is fun. We are hoping for a Kunark type release for higher levels, but I know we are only dreaming.</div></div><hr />

I solo, 2 box and maybe group with a buddy now and then - obviously GOD was useless to me and I did not buy it.<br />
<br />
We'll see what happens with Omens - if they accomodate my play style then they've made a sale.  I have a feeling a lot of the problem with GOD sales is they do not accomodate people that fall within the play style I like.  <br />
<br />
I know the BIG GUILD, END GAME, UBER players are the vocal group and they thus get the most attention.  But there is an awful lot of us that don't fall in that group (probably more than fall within the UBER ME, ME, ME group); and guess what; our money is just as green.<br />
<br />
If you want to make sales ya gotta give the people what they want!  People that don't play the UBER style aren't going to buy UBER only expansions.</div></div><hr />

Also a level 70 cap will increse the ability of small groups and open up areas and mobs that they might not have been able to take before.<br />
<br />
Being in a casual guild myself, I have done my fair share of raiding, nothing high end mind you, but I see the level increase of this expansion as a blessing.  At level 70, one group of moderatley geared people should be able to take alot of older raid content that still drops gear that would be upgrades.  My guild never had more than 20 people on a night and we were able to do tons.  BoT towers, alot of ssra content, all of Velious, tier 1 pop gods.....<br />
<br />
I forsee people 1 grouping Terris and Grummus at level 70.</div></div><hr />
