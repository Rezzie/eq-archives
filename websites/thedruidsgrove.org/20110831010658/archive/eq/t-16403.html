I am currently 77 and on my way to 80 via soloing. I also plan to max my swimming and alcohol tolerance too with the new caps. One skill I have never really dealt with is &quot;Throwing&quot;. I would like to max that too while I root and rot things.<br />
 <br />
Can anyone recommend druid throwing items that can be vendor purchased that will give me skill ups in that catagory? Most of the throwing items I have seen are not for druids. I've been told that a pouch drops in the SSRA basement that will summon throwing items and they are druid useable, so if I have to go fight skellies (VT Shard Nightmare) then I will.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for the help, and onto 78!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a random drop from Dreadspire also.</div></div><hr />

You have to have good faction with Claws of Veeshan and Thurgadin.  If you do, it's really easy.  Summons 100 throwing hammers with 55 range.  Fine for practicing</div></div><hr />

i used Elite Dragorn Jekisia (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=16264) in blood fields. just summona pile of dagers and toss at him intell he is at 90% gate back to the gate in point run back repeat just as long as he stays over 90% if i rember he will not summon ya and he will not move or call his 2 little flunkys.<br />
and if your guild raid dreadspire i used it a lot on  Roley DeFarge (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=20031) seeign that sa long fight and not much a druid to do there ya can skill up fast on him.</div></div><hr />

There are raid mobs outside who don't see invis; inside each room is a &quot;chained bazu&quot;.<br />
<br />
They are literally chained, or leashed.  Stand just outside the room and throw away.  I actually dozed off at the keyboard there, waking up occasionally to summon more shissar fangs.</div></div><hr />

Hummm....time to dig out my Bracer of Hammerfel, I think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuiggi</div><div class="date">11-26-2007, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I completed the Bracer of Hammerfall quest. I went to Noble's Causeway and found the &quot;Chained Bazu&quot; mobs, they were light blue to me at 78. I had 400 summoned items and hit /autofire. I was throwing hammers but no skills ups and I tossed over 150 before I stopped. I have &quot;1&quot; in Throwing, so I did train in it years and YEARS ago, but I have never used it. What am I doing wrong? I cannot get a skill up to happen. Thanks in advance for any tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tanyenwoodelf</div><div class="date">12-02-2007, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recall that Bracer of Hammerfall summons hammers without the tag magic lore.  <br />
 <br />
- Hammers are not hitting the mob either: <br />
     too close<br />
     too far<br />
     not equipped properly<br />
     or mob is wearing some magic armor, then the hammers won't hit them.<br />
 <br />
I had to get the pouch of Ssra basement.   <br />
 <br />
Went to steppes, grabbed a gnoll, snared it, rooted it and /autofire away.   Rerooted it, every once in a while and resnared it.    Took almost 2 hr to skillup to max.</div></div><hr />
