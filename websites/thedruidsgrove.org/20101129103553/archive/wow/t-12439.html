My first toon was a pally just after WoW launch.  Played him till 60 and raided... but he kept getting nerfed.  Really bummed me out.<br />
<br />
I rerolled rogue.  Played him for a few months to 60 but he kept getting nerfed.  Really bummed me out.  I took a long break.<br />
<br />
Came back and rerolled druid.  Played him for a few months and really enjoy raid healing with him.  I never PvP with him - but people started to whine about druids being OP in arena and such.  Which I think is funny - we die -so- easily.  Anyway, now he's getting the PvE nerf bat in 2.4 with the coefficient reduction.  Which I totally don't get.<br />
<br />
Nerf after nerf after nerf!  :mad:  Must be my bad attitude.  =/</div></div><hr />
