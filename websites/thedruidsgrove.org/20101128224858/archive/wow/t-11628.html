<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oakmeister</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm level 63 and want to experiment with a Balance spec (I am currently Feral), however many posts have lead me to believe that if I respec w/o the proper gear, I will be hard pressed to experience the full range of Balance. I have very little INT/+spell damage gear. <br />
<br />
I would like to consider options for Balance gear which can be bought at the AH or from other players with Leather Crafting skills. So far, this set has caught my attention, and looks to be feasible (i.e. mats are not difficult to obtain at my level): <br />
Wild Draenish Armor<br />

<br />
At level 63 would this set be a good start for trying the Balance spec? I would prefer NOT to have too much cloth armor.<br />
<br />
What other pieces of armor would experienced Balance Druids recommend which are readily available through the AH?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any all suggestions.<br />

Its crazy good for new Balance Druids. Don't forget to also search Misc Rings and Misc Neck. If you want pure +spell damage instead of +dmg/heal, search under the Cloth armor section.</div></div><hr />

(a warr. friend of mine got these boots I would die for from a quest in outlands (cant recall name at the moment, sorry)<br />
