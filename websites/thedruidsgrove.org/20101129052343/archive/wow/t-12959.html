<br />

<br />
An example of what I just said is Omen of Clarity (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=16864). I wouldn't use it in BG's, just arenas to take that free heal that may actually save you<br />
<br />
Another thing that bugs me is how you would leave out of your first spec Vengeance (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=16913). You'll double your dmg with this ability per crit so assuming you'll have your percentage of crit the enough to crit quite some times, this is a must!<br />
<br />
Just my first two cents^^</div></div><hr />

didnt know vengeance would make that much difference (guess i didnt look at tooltip correctly :D) thanks <br />
i must say im still not sure if i wanna leave out starfall :/</div></div><hr />

Stuns are uber.  And starfall can stun per hit so it's pretty awesome.  For PvP you can drop balance of power and probably eclipse.  I don't know how often you're going to have to toss out starfalls to be honest.  Nature's Focus is also a really good PvP talent.   Possibly more useful than Master Shapeshifter or Improved MotW (which will get dispelled anyway half the time &lt;_&lt;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sauge</div><div class="date">11-14-2008, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well after rethinking i come up with this<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xGbhiIoIdhAzRuZMxcz<br />

Starfire takes 2.5 secs to cast..Isn't that more than viable to have an interrupt or something? Obviously I'm counting out haste, but it still takes too long imo and you'll be easily interrupted, although a stun is always welcome, if it can be quickly done^^</div></div><hr />
