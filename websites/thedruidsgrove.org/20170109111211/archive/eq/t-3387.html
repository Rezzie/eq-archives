I have full set of Woven Grass and want to know if it's worth getting Elysian.  I notice it's more AC and HPs, but it seems to be less mana.  Is less mana worth having more hps and ac?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerillea</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really depends.  Some pieces of Elysian armor blow away Woven grass, other pieces do not.<br />
<br />
Woven Grass bracers are a good example of WG being better then Elsyian for one.  9 wis 30 hp/mana on WG versus 3 wis 15 mana on Eylsian.<br />
<br />
Woven Grass BP has more hp/mana then the Elysian tunic, though the elysian tunic has better resists.  However, if your primarily raiding Luclin, resists are meaningless. 74 HP 80 mana on WG versus 30 hp 75 mana on Elysian.<br />
<br />
Woven Grass Legs vs Elysian leggings are the real harder decision.  35 hp and 90 mana on WG leggings vs 95 HP on Eylsian leggings<br />
<br />
Headpiece not worth it.<br />
<br />
Boots: 50 mana WG boots vs 30 hp 15 mana Elysian boots<br />
<br />
Arms: 30 hp/mana WG arms vs 43 hp and 25 mana.  Elysian more hp here.</div></div><hr />

Thats what I do with the BP.<br />
I love my Elysian tunic, but I do switch out when i need more hp, or at least when I need to regen the group.   = )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know why someone said that the headpiece isn't worth it, but the Elysian piece is better than WG if you can stand the graphics (more ac and sta and you only lose 2 wis).</div></div><hr />

elysian is better :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobben</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am wearing full Elysian armor save for the crown and gloves at the moment.  For me it is the only viable end gameish armor, I dont have time to  raid TOV with my guild due to my family committments.  So I went to UP every chance I could and managed to get all the pieces except the head and hands.  Statwise it is superior to Thurgadin and probably SS especially in the Sta/HP area.  The Wis is good, the mana is not so good.  Resists on the BP are nice (8 to all).  <br />
<br />
I did manage to get a Thurg BP MQ from a friend for the RoTG right click but I do not wear it except to use the effect and then put the Elysian back on.  Plus I like not looking like every other druid.  &quot;Sorry, I can't port you...im a.....paladin, yeah thats it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think Elysian looks like crap, other than that I am much more interested in mana than hitpoints, so woven grass wins on every account there for me.<br />
<br />
Sure I work on hitpoints too, but mana gets priority in my world. I just dont die that often and I have plenty of hps/sta gear as it is and when it becomes a big issue I just throw back on my fungi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, yes.  I know.  AC is not important against mobs like vindi/statue/rumble.  But I xp with a ranger, monk, wizard ALL the time.   Monk is the tank.  Ranger is archer and a damn good one too.  I get agro and I have to tank it, until it's rooted or monk gets it back.  <br />
<br />
My guild does xp a lot.  We are not a pure raiding guild yet.  So AC/HP is very important to me.  Besides, I don't have a mana problem.  80pp will get me C3. :) <br />

The way I look at this is what are you capable of getting?  Are you in a guild that farms ToV currently?  Or do you have a group of friends to help in Umbral?  Do you want to go through the hours of farming ToV for armor drops?  I dont know what other druids have had to encounter, but there is a reason I have Nature Walkers Chestguard and leggings (kael tunic/legs from WToV) instead of the Woven Grass.  We had 3 druids get leather tunics from HoT.  Our drop rates sucked big time when it came to the Leather tunic and were a tad better with the leggings, but still sucked.  So again, I think whatever you can get, get it.  The stats are very close in most respects.  Get what you can.  If I could I would go with the Quest armor personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loralin</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have both a full set of Woven Grass and Ely Armor.  <br />
<br />
At my current stage I am trying to maximize mana &amp; FT so I am wearing my Woven Grass armor and just swap in Ely as needed.<br />
<br />
I also agree with the statement that leather drops in HoT are very rare.   We did about 6 months of raids to get 4 druids in full SS gear minus one BP.  That's with almost all of the leather drops going to druids, the monks didn't really want much SS gear besides a bracer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But then, you chose to play a short druid with hairy feet, so we all know what that says about your taste....:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Item by item, Elysian is better for most slots except the BP.  The RoG effect on the SS BP makes it superior, IMO.  See the above URL for an analysis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chenier</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm so torn over this.<br />
<br />
I have Ely bp and legs and NW everything else. I'm dying to be all green (not that I don't like the Ely look - wood elven butts look huge in leather), but the 75 mana on the legs and clicky on the bp.../drool<br />
<br />
Then I look at the other druids in my guild who don't have either - and it'll break my heart to not put in the merit loot request for the next bp or legs that drop so that it can go to them because I want them so much for myself.<br />
<br />
But the Ely is good armor and the NW would be a far larger upgrade for them than me.<br />
<br />
Just frustrated...at myself, and at the uber rare drop rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Woven Grass head and there's really no competition to wear that over Elysian, though granted if the Elysian wasn't fugly it might be a closer fight.  (I wear tranix or froggy crown if I need saves)<br />
<br />
Elysian gloves aren't very hot, I wear Coldain Skin or Grey Flesh instead (CS everyday wear, GF if I need resists, until I sell them)<br />
<br />
Elysian bracer is garbage IMO, I wear a supple scale bracer and thurg bracer, I'd like to upgrade the thurg bracer to woven grass, but I really like the focus on the supple scale, there's not much that I'd wear over it unless I got a different range 3 item.<br />
<br />
I wear Elysian legs and wouldn't change them for either woven grass or nature walker's due to the hp/ac loss (the green color of WG or NW doesn't help their chances any either).<br />
<br />
I wear elysian boots, I could've gotten woven grass boot MQ really cheap and had the CFEs, but I wouldn't wear them and a friend of mine needed the CFEs anyways.<br />
<br />
I wear elysian tunic, I want a RotG bp for the click, but except for possibly woven grass I wouldn't wear them except long enough to click.<br />
<br />
I want elysian arms, last piece of elysian that I haven't had drop except for the craptastic bracers that I don't want.  Currently wearing gladiator chain arms, so I still look like a newbie ranger.</div></div><hr />

Elysian makes me feel like a ranger and well... I would rather be a human than a ranger. Nah, no I wouldnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Advantage of looking like a ranger is that no one asks me for ports until they /who me (I'm very rarely /anon or /role), and by the time they figure out that I can port I'm 3 zones away.</div></div><hr />

Its all a matter of what you feel is more important for your character hp's/ac or mana. I myself am going woven grass for the mana, although I do have a set of elysian in the bank minus the arms for corpse runs =P</div></div><hr />
