<br />
Im thinking at this point about working on a mudflow stone (sta isnt close to max without raid buffs) and getting it fixed up with pure dexterity to give it improved dodge.  The boost to dodge would be nice...if it really makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Has anyone actualy equipped anything with pure dexterity?  Would hate to make the thing and not have it be any better than the aug from ldon, the 8 percent one.<br />

PS Pure potency, quickening and virility are the other main options Im considering.</div></div><hr />
