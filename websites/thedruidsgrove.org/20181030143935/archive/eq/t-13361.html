(PoR L70 Auras, Caster Classes)<br />
By Fenier<br />
<br />
MISSION 1<br />
<br />
1. Talk to Tak'Valnakor @ 6880, -1350 in North Ro. Get task.<br />
<br />
2. Go into The Ruins of Takish-Hiz (static) there you will locate Krylin @ -410, -40 inside of a overturned tower. Hail him to open your instance in the Root of Ro.<br />
<br />
3. The Root of Ro Instance entrance is to the right of the zone in, along the wall.  It is a cave located at:  640, -600  It is HIGH on the wall. Once inside you must collect 5 different tablet items.<br />
-- The first 4 are random on your way to the boss.<br />
-- The Boss is melee, yellow to 70, max hit around 1300, drops the final tablet item.<br />
<br />
4. Return the Tablets to Tak'Valnakor in North Ro to recieve mission 2.<br />
<br />
NOTES: <br />
-- All other mobs than the ones mentioned above are Dark Blue / White<br />
-- Treants have a abilitiy called Bark Mulch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8581&amp;source=Live), this is moderate DoT with Snare.  MR-200.  <br />
-- Wind Models have an 1200 AE DD, which is FR-400 known as Fire Blast (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8614&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
<br />
MISSION 2<br />
<br />
1. Talk to Tak'Valnakor @ 6880, -1350 in North Ro. Get task.<br />
<br />
2. Go to to Queen Tal'Yaliz @ 5950, -2080 in North Ro. She is in a Tower near the Scarb platform. Talking to her ports your group into an instanced version of Ruins of Takish-Hiz.<br />
<br />
3. Hunt down 5 Priests.  They are yellow con and hit around 1500.  They have *alot* of hitpoints.  All other mobs are Green/Blue.<br />
-- Priest One:  Located at Building with enterance at 100, -960<br />
-- Priest Two:  Located at Building with enterance at 260, -460<br />
-- Priest Three:  Located at Building with enterance at 130, 100<br />
-- Priests Four and Five are inside the Palace located at: -13, 135<br />
<br />
To reach Priest 4:  Enter the Palace, clear left.  Go down that passage, there is a staircase on your left.  Go down the stairs, there is a room to the East.  Enter that room.  Fouth Priest is in a side room on the left hand side.<br />
<br />
To Reach Priest 5:  Exit the East room where you just in for Priest 4, ther eis a hallway ahead of you, and Archs on the Left and Right.  Priest 5 is on the second floor of the Right Arch.<br />
<br />
4. After slaying the 5 Priests the Prince will spawn in the Amptheater area.  Appox Loc is 20, -300. Prince hits 1850ish, but not that fast.<br />
<br />
He casts Death's Beckon (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=7046&amp;source=Live) every 60 seconds (single target high powered lifetap)  Tank reported it landing for 1800ish. DR - 200.<br />
<br />
He also has a AE Curse, which is Curse of Silir (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8957&amp;source=Live).  This is a MR -250 check DoT with a trigger.  After 30 seconds (and the spell wears off) it fires Curse of Ice Trigger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8543&amp;source=Live) and you take 8000 Damage unresistable.  I am not sur ethe number of curse counters as Lucy does not list the exact number - it says unknown calucation.<br />
<br />
Thus - it is very important to Resist or Cure (RGC!) the curse as it lands.  You can not let it run 30 seconds.  (For those Fimilar with Bloodeye and Arch-Magus, similar effect, just its not a DT).<br />
<br />
5. After slaying The Prince, talk to Queen Tal'Yaliz in North Ro. <br />
<br />
NOTES:<br />
-- Earth Elementals in this mission cast Stupefy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8613&amp;source=Live),  This effect is MR - 200, lowers Wisdom and Int by 150 (thus decreasing the amount of available mana you have) and lowers Endurance by 200 / tick.  The effect lasts 2 minutes.  It should be able to be removed with Radiant Cure or better.<br />
<br />
<br />
MISSION 3<br />
<br />
1. Talk to Tak'Valnakor @ 6880, -1350 in North Ro. Get task.<br />
<br />
2. Go to to Queen Tal'Yaliz @ 5950, -2080 in North Ro. She is in a Tower near the Scarb platform. The player who talks to her will receive the Queen's Crown. Talking to her ports your group into an instanced version of Ruins of Takish-Hiz.<br />
<br />
3. Loot 3 NO DROP items: The Scepter, The Wand and The Signet. <br />
All Trash mobs in this mission are blue unless otherwise noted.<br />
<br />
3a. THE SCEPTER<br />
The first chest is located in this building:  100, -960 The chest is on the second floor and guarded by 3 Yellow Con Elves. Loot Sceptre. <br />
<br />
3b. THE WAND<br />
The scepter is located in this building:  260, -460  This is in a chest also on the second floor - again guarded by 3 yellow con Elves. Loot: Wand<br />
<br />
3c. THE SIGNET<br />
The Priest is in the Temple.  Temple Enterance is located at -13, 135<br />
<br />
To reach the Final Priest clear inside the Temple to the left.  Go down that passage.  On your left you will see a staircase.  Take the Left Staircase.  There is a Archway on your Left - this is the one you want.  <br />
<br />
Inside the room there is a ramp to the second floor.  The Final Priest is up there.  He is guarded by 2 Yellow Con Sand Elf Clerics.<br />
<br />
Kill The adds and charge the Priest.<br />
<br />
During the Fight 80/40 percent He calls for help.  I noticed on track adds did spawn, but they did not spawn on us, nor did they charge us from this location.  This may be bugged.<br />
<br />
Kill the Priest and Loot the Signet.<br />
<br />
NOTE: You need need to make your way back to the zone in and zone into South Ro.<br />
<br />
4. Once in South Ro, zone into the non-instanced verison of Ruins of Takish-Hiz.  You need to make your way to the Portal to the Elddar Forest located at 103, -177.  It appears as a Sand Storm.  You need to enter the Elddar Forest.<br />
<br />
5. Once in Elddar Forest make your way to location:  116, -54 (First building on the Left when you zone in).<br />
<br />
Have the person who did the looting hand all 4 items to Maryin Tak'Yaliz.<br />
<br />
Recieve Spell:  Aura of Life!<br />
<br />
Chest will spawn beside Maryin with loot for completing the mission.<br />

Talk to quest giver<br />
<br />
Hail the queen in North Ro and recieve the crown.<br />
<br />
say prepared<br />
<br />
This zones you in to instanced zone (thank god no under world bug)<br />
 There is a tower to the northeast, and one to the southeast. ( the 2 closest towers to the ZI)  up top of these are 3 mob that can't be harmo'd and a chest. north chest has wand, south has sceptre. <br />
<br />
Now the high priest.<br />
High priest is in the building with the pit. clear to the tight. he is in the same room as one of the priests from last mission.  NW room/tower upper floor.  Kill all mobs in this area no matter what.  he will call for help, but if you left none alive, he has none. he's pretty gimp.. especially after the mission 2 fight. (mission 2 was the hardest of the 3 missions IMO)<br />
<br />
loot the symbol<br />
<br />
Evac your group and click out of zone.<br />
zone into non instance tak<br />
click on the cyclone/whirlwind and zone to eldar forrest.<br />
<br />
Turn in symbol, wand, sceptre, and crown to the Queen??? yeah she's not queen yet, her name is Maryn Tak'Yaliz, she's level 70, and she's in the first building to the left of the zone in, near the mission giver Shalown the Pure.<br />
<br />
All group members /cheer  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">02-23-2006, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finished these up last night also.  Figured I'd post a couple pointers and what might make this easier on your group.<br />
<br />
First off mission 2 has a bug that is frequently putting most members under the world upon zoning in to the instanced Tak'ish.  Suggest taking a druid or wiz for this mission so that you can evac most of your group.  Do not duck as soon as you zone in or you won't be able to stand back up to cast gate / evac etc.<br />
<br />
Next missions 2 and 3 both have quite a few mobs to clear to get to the Priests (mission 2) or to chests and High Priest (mission 3).  You can avoid killing all these mobs if you'd like.  What my group did was go to a building, sent in an eye of zomm to locate the position of a priest.  When we found a priest we'd all train in to the priest (usually up a spiral ramp) our enchanter would mez or AE stun and we'd just burn down the priest then I would evac.  We'd head to the next building and repeat, these missions can be done very fast like this.  They really aren't bad clearing mobs either, I was just in a rush so I had time to sleep before work QQ.<br />
Note: My group was entirely full of people who are Demiplane geared so this probably is not safe for everyone to go training around, but in general the mobs in these missions are weak for this mission arc.<br />
<br />
I heard that mission 3 was giving people their aura without doing the others also, but a few tried this at the end of the night and it didn't work apparently.  They had done mission 1 and mission 3 only I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a rezzer that zones in unstuck anyone stuck can just pull agro and die. Your corpse will pop at the zone in. (Only tested this once though, did anyone else have the same happen?)<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
If you have a mage unstuck they can just CotH everyone out.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
And getting stuck is weird.. ogre, woodelf and halfling didn't get stuck. Frog got stuck 3 times, erudite 8 times. 6th person in group was necro who got stuck but evaced himself.. so we did the mission with 4 of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">02-23-2006, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also forgot, make sure the same person loots all 3 pieces in the final mission.  If different people loot items Queen will not take them.  All 3 have to be handed in at the same time by 1 person.  We had to re-do this mission just so 1 person could loot all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mission 2 is the Hardest due to the Curse, but the average hit on mobs is 1k or less with named doing between 130- and 1800.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shruella</div><div class="date">02-24-2006, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another tip - the Priests do not assist the trash mobs (and vice versa) in the second mission. If you can get line of sight on a priest, you can pull it right out from a group of friends with zero adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RC6 cures that 8k nuke debuff, the two of us alternated and it only misfired once near the end. 0 deaths but cleric got to 1% life (from using AA then curse going off)<br />
<br />
Ranger tanked the whole thing<br />
<br />
Timer on the 8k nuke was 1:00 not 30 secs<br />
<br />
Also in mission 3:<br />
<br />
Everyone in group can get the crown before zoning in.  While only one person can do the turnin because it requires all 4 items, I suggest that the looter be chosen before entering, or have everyone get a crown and then decide who will loot.</div></div><hr />

Did mission with 3 Pallys, a Cleric, Wizard, and Druid (me).  We cleared a section, and when repops started due to our low dps and lack of slows, we invised and moved.  Locating the 4th tablet spawns the Yellow Con mob, he is not up until then.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: (ok, figured out what #3 is)<br />
... for mission #1 I think it is &quot;ancient city&quot;<br />
... for mission #2 its &quot;rest&quot;<br />
... for mission #3 its &quot;visit her&quot;<br />
<br />
(Note: the reason the keywords are important is that if you get bugged like I did and finished mssion #3 but didnt receive Aura spell - the NPC doesnt allow you to redo these missions easily, ie. he doesnt offer a text script chance to go back over the text lines needed. These words will let you get the exact mission you need)<br />

With the chests, once you figure out which building the chests are in, yes they do move around (if you have a enchanter cast site works great for this not sure what other classes may get that spell ). We have our tank train the mobs out of the building while someone leved in thru the top window and looted the chest then back out again. Like Kaidman already pointed out, same person has to loot all the pieces. Whoever gets the task will get the crown.<br />
<br />
If your shrunk your not going out the same way you came in, so your tank still needs to have them trained so you can float down and out of the tower.<br />
<br />
Your tank can either zone the train out or take one for the team.</div></div><hr />
