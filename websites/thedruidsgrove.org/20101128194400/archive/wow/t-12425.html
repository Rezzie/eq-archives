      I will be opening my first WoW account in the next couple of days. I am going to make an horde druid (friends are horde) and I am leaning towards feral. I was doing some research and it seems like the best tree balance for a feral druid would be Lvl 70 1/47/13. Does this seem right? Also could anyone suggest some tips about being a good druid I would appreciate it?<br />
      Another thing I was wondering was how important are macro's and UIs. I have done some looking into them and they seem to make things easier but dont really understand exactly what they do. If any one could explain how they work and if they are essential, good macros and UIs to use. <br />
     One last thing I was wondering was about professions. I heard the best way to make gold from the start was to go w/ skinning and mining. Does this seem right or is there a better combination for a druid.<br />
     Any imput and other info you think I should know would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank You, <br />
       Dan</div></div><hr />

Macros and custom UI addons are nice to have, but not essential for playing.  You can get by fine with the default UI.<br />
<br />
And welcome to TDG. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-25-2008, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello new druid :&gt;  Welcome to our druid grove ! ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
To address your questions in turn:<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;best&quot; spec.  There are some specs that are recognised as being effective in many situations, however it's really just up to you to find what spec suits the way you like to play.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
You posted a link to your intended spec in another thread. (http://thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/showthread.php?t=12427)  I'm afraid I didn't realise you were completely new to WoW so let me know if any of jargon I've used is alien to you, and I will endeavour to explain.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A macro is essentially a script, like a piece of programming code, that lets you cast abilities in a certain order, or based on some conditions.<br />
You really don't need macros at all, they make life easier when you are level 70 but honestly you should worry about levelling up first, and then when the time comes we will tell you all you need to know.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
When we talk about UI's, we mean modifications to the way the game looks.  You start out with the default UI, and this is perfectly fine to play with, however once you are levelled up a bit more perhaps you want your row of buttons to look different, or you want your minimap in a different place on the screen, and so on.  These things can be accomplished with Addons, which are little player-created programs that change the appearance of the User Interface, or UI.<br />
<br />
Some people go crazy and make beautiful, intricate designs for their UI's.  Others use the bare minimum to get by for their raiding or pvp needs, while still others use nothing at all.  Once again, this is something you should only worry about once you have levelled up a bit and learned the basics of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for professions, it used to be the case that professions were one of the key ways to make money, but that is no longer the case and Blizzard have made it very easy for anyone to make money by introducing something called Daily Quests.<br />
So the best way to decide what professions to go for is to figure out what activities you would find most fun :&gt;<br />
<br />
Personally, I went for alchemy and herbalism, the idea being that I can pick flowers with Herbalism, then mix them up into potions and elixirs with Alchemy.  Many professions (also sometimes known as Trade Skills) complement each other in this way, for example Mining and Blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
When choosing your trade skills, it's ok and in fact recommended to use roleplaying a bit to help you decide.  For example, a warrior might choose to build his own armor and weapons, as warriors have historically been apt to doing, and thus choose Mining and Blacksmithing.  A gnome mage might choose engineering, as both gnomes are perceived to be intelligent - engineering is seen as a skill that requires intelligence.<br />
<br />
Those aren't brilliant examples but hopefully you get my drift.  Also remember there are secondary trade skills - fishing, cooking, campfire-making, and first aid - and these can all be learned by everyone.  You can only learn two Primary trade skills, though.  They are Enchanting, Jewelcrafting, Mining, Blacksmithing, Engineering, Leatherworking, Skinning, Herbalism and Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Which you choose is up to you, however I would suggest that Blacksmithing is not a very suitable skill for druids, as we are unable to use most of the items created by that particular profession.  All the others can be useful, though :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that this helps.  I hope that you will continue to post here, and let us know how you get on :&gt;<br />

<br />
If you read many forums and such you will often see 90% of the topics related to level 70. Thats cause the game gets more complex at this lvl and most of the ppl are already lvl 70 or have characters there.<br />
<br />
But u shouldnt try to rush as fast as u can to level 70.<br />
Enjoy the time playing your druid and explore the mighty world of warcraft!<br />
There is so much to see out there and so many things to experience ;-)</div></div><hr />

At lvl 10 you get your BEAR. And he is awesome.<br />
But from 10 to 20 lvling is really slow. But dont give up.<br />
When u reach 20 you get catform and all the struggling through those 10 levels is rewarded with the OMG WTF IMBA KITTIE ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
dont forget to do your aquatic form quests at 16, at least i think it is at 16 (could any 1 confirm this) it does help alot plus it is needed from what i see of the vid for epic flight form (chasing some gezza throught the water) i dont think i need to say anymore as the post above explain very well what is needed.<br />
<br />
anyway good luck with your druid :)</div></div><hr />

They make questing so much easier.  No more Alt-Tab to look something up on wowhead (well at least there is less of that).</div></div><hr />

I absolutely agree with this.<br />

<br />
Yes, it is level 16, and overlord is right - it's important to get this out of the way.  You will be glad of it later on.<br />
<br />
There is a useful guide to doing the aquatic form quests here:<br />

<br />
This is the place for the addons, just extract/copy them in this folder and they are available in game.<br />
<br />
After you logged in (you are now in the screen where u see your characters) you have in the left-down corner a button &quot;AddOns&quot;. Click it! :-)<br />
<br />
Ingame there are for most addons buttons or symbols around your minimap where u can configure your addons.<br />
If there is no button or symbol for an addon, then u have to start it with a command (this is mostly explained on the site where u downloaded the addon).<br />
<br />
We cant explain all the addons here to you cause there are sooo much^^<br />
Just take some time and read the manuals to the addons.<br />
You'll get the hang of it in no time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eihcet0000</div><div class="date">03-04-2008, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I created a trial account 12 days ago and started playing.  I did this because I was an EQer years ago and I know a friend of mine has been playing WoW since beta.  Well I made it to 16 before my trial account ran out and the more and more forums I read I get the feeling that if i'm only going to play 8-15 hours a week and mostly at random times where i will be by myself i don't know if i want to buy the game and spend the money for the subscription.  Basically what i think my problem is that i'm a solo player.  With that said, can i get to 70 as a random solo player just picking up the help when i need it?  Is that possible?  When i first started this trial account I started on one server and played the druid to 11 and it was easy doing quests when tons of people were around doign them.  then when i found out what server my friend plays on and started another druid it was a little harder doing the same quests but i managed to just hook up with a few other players at the time.  This was all under lvl 10.  Is picking up up randomly going to be possible to 70?  <br />
thanks for you opinions everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">03-04-2008, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can easily solo your why to 70.  Probably 98% of the time I leveled both my characters I was solo.  Just skip the harder quests, as there is no real need to do them.  There is plenty of XP in the game.<br />
<br />
That said the real question is what will a solo player do once they reach 70?  Start a new character?  BG PvP is about your only &quot;real&quot; option.<br />
<br />
But I wouldn't worry about that now, by the time you reach lvl 70, you should know what you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninetoes</div><div class="date">04-13-2008, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello fellow newbie. If I might offer some sage advice, from someone who's been playing this game since the end of open beta, it would be this.<br />
<br />
Read the quest text.<br />
<br />
No, I'm serious. Most people have absolutely no idea what's going on in this game, as far as the storyline. The lore of wow, while originally stolen from Games Workshop (yeah, yeah, I'm one of THOSE guys), has developed so well that it's really worth your time to read the quests and understand what's behind why it is you're killing those @#$$ing murlocs :)<br />
<br />
That, and, well...really, get used to rotating your camera 360 degres while soloing or grouping. <br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Initially I did this for PvP reasons, but staying sharp while soloing will come in handy even if you're not worried about wankers comming up and ganking ya.</div></div><hr />
