Can someone please list info on Priest Bjek and Priest Grenmk (sp)?  Such as PH's, etc.  <br />
<br />
 I spent about 20 minutes looking for them but they were no shows.  I'm fairly sure they wander near Kael, but didn't see them on track.</div></div><hr />

Just been really lazy about levelling any twinks lately, tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tresjoli</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An excellent source for information on this quest maybe be on Allakhazam's Magical Realm at &lt;everquest.allakhazam.com/...quest=971&gt; (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=971&gt;)<br />
<br />
The locations for the giants are:<br />
Priest Grenk - roams near Kael to the northwest <br />
Priest Bjek - roams near the PoG tower to the south <br />
Priest Delar - roams near the Dragon Circle supposedly <br />
Derakor the Vindicator - Deep in Kael<br />
<br />
There aren't any placeholders, and most the time they're stomping about and not too terribly difficult to find.  I'm not sure what the exact respawn time is once they're killed, but I'm pretty certain it's 24 hours or less.<br />
<br />
The priests can be killed with one group heavy on melee and healing as they're resistant to spells.  It takes a very strong raiding party to kill Derakor.</div></div><hr />

They were all blue but I couldn't snare them until after they'd been tashed.  I definitely recommend having some melees take the abuse for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But its nice for mass buffing all the non essential tanks so if they get hit they have a smaller DS up.<br />

<br />
the priests are a 2-3 day spawn. just pull booboo out and pet track them from the druid circle.<br />
<br />
easy kills, they cast judgement and CH, but they spent most of their mana nuking me while i pulled them halfway across the zone (ouch btw)<br />
<br />
snared easily at 60, duoed them all with a monk.</div></div><hr />
