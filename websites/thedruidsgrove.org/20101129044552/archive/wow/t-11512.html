<br />
 Im at work right now (work for a grocery retailer) and just afew minutes ago I look up and what do I see but a big yellow question mark, so I walk over and start clicking on the guy.  hehe   no not really.<br />
<br />
 Guy came into the store wearing a black hat with a big yellow question mark on it and as he turned I see Blizzard on the back. Ended up talking to the guy for afew minutes about the game. What made it kinda funny is that he is about my age (which shall remain secret  :P  )</div></div><hr />

Day expansion came out, a whole 20ish of my school guys and girls are all heading to EB Games, turns out they all had preordered TBC...pretty fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At my current job, one guy mentioned WoW, but I didn't think to ask him if he played it.</div></div><hr />

A few of my friends were ranting about it, so i decided to check it out... it's kind of funny how sportbike discussions turn into WoW discussion now... lol<br />
<br />
i rolled my first character and a few other guys rolled alts on the same server. they've helped me out with instances a couple of times and gotten me hooked up with a guild...<br />
<br />
i must say that i was one of the older guys waiting in line at EB for BC the night it was released... that was the only place i've seen the hat that was mentioned earlier...<br />
<br />
NO ONE other than me at my job plays WoW :( they all laughed at the Leeroy Jenkins video though</div></div><hr />

<br />
But actually, the majority of people I know who played WoW and stopped tops the number of people I know who play WoW ;)<br />
(note: These people played for years, multi 60's and just got sick of the grind)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Staven</div><div class="date">02-22-2007, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got introduced to WOW by a friend, I then got one of my friends hooked (he is now a higher lvl than me, kinda embarrassing) and we were talking about it and walked past some more of my friends, me and a guy form the other group both said 'Arathi Basin' at the same time, kinda odd how I had known this guy for about 2 years, played on the same server as him and still didnt know he played.<br />
It went well after that, we made a guild etc. :)<br />
After that I discovered that about 20 people in the building played WOW :)</div></div><hr />

I started Halloween of 2006, and been leveling a few toons. I just found out quite a few people from my shop play. So, I started a new toon on their server and joined their guild. <br />
 <br />
Now I'm torn on what to play. I have a character that I really like and a nice guild on SWC, but RL friends and coworkers on the other server.</div></div><hr />

I hate playing 2 different servers which is why when I transferred my druid I raised new alts on this server...</div></div><hr />

My instinctive reaction is ofc to get on all fours and taunt the worthless fishman.. then I remember I'm on the subway and people would think I was mental.<br />
<br />
Erhm.. nvm.</div></div><hr />

Just yesterday night I was on the bus and these 2 people (a guy and a girl) were talking about WoW nonstop and pretty loudly. They were definite newbies as they were talking about like 'whoa im level 12 man...psychic scream is this...blah blah blah&quot;<br />
<br />
It was pretty funny because I remember when I was just starting and how incredible this game was...now its just meh.</div></div><hr />
