<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-12-2007, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So we were trying Maiden of Virtue in Kara last night, and couldn't get her below 50%.  <br />
<br />
We read all the wowwiki, thott, alla and other strat guides we could find, and the one that worked best is if someone from the group stood in front of each of the pillars, just outside of the concecration range.  A pally would put up blessing of sacrafice, and we had a tree druid, so 2 healers were able to heal through the repentance.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the stupid holy fire would kill people immediatley.   <br />
<br />
Anyone have any tips or suggestions?  Think the reason we couldn't down her is cause ppl weren't cleansing quick enough?  Or maybe some other flaw in our strat?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's how I last did it and it went well....though as I recall even in tree I got stunned.<br />
<br />
Spread out so everyone is between pillars with their backs to the wall.  <br />
<br />
I suggest putting the 2 healers to the left and right of the MT.  It seems that that holy fire is range based as well and if the healers were too close to the Maiden during the repentence, she'd 1 or 2 shot us :(<br />
<br />
The dot needs to get cleansed ASAP, and only having 1 or 2 melee in there helps considerably.  Do you have a shadow priest?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-12-2007, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to ask....who ends up dying first?  Is it the healers getting 1 &amp; 2 shot by the holy fire?  Is it DPS dying and just don't have enough to down her or maybe the tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-12-2007, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a shadow priest.  Also a resto druid, holy pally, enhancement shaman and myself (as we didn't need OT) healing.<br />
<br />
No matter what we did, we couldn't seem to get the holy fire off of us quick enough.  Also, we couldn't manage to figure out how she targets the holy fires.  I got holy fired the first time, and I was ALL the way back against the wall (trying out range / los to see if that made a difference).  Then the next try, someone who was super close got holy fired.  Then the time after that, it was someone else that was standing where they should be that got holy fired.  When a healer died early, we wiped.  When a hunter or warlock died early, we wiped eventually because of a lack of dps.<br />
<br />
We're going back to try again tonigh (assuming everyone shows up).  <br />
<br />
The more that I think about it, the reason that we weren't getting cleansed has to be because we weren't in range or out of los of the 2 classes that could cleanse.  Having decursive would really help here, as 2 seconds of the DoT is enough to kill someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">03-13-2007, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Previously, tree druids were immune to the holy attack, and she would automatically target the person closest to her who was not at the top of the aggro list. With the last big patch they fixed the treelol immunity and now her holy attack is random. Just need to dispel the effect as soon as possible. We use a priest and a pally and space them at 12 and 6 o'clock in the room so they will both be in range of anyone who needs cleansing. Also make sure everyone else is evenly spaced around the room to avoid the chain lightning attack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menellinde</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use basically the same approach with dispellers at 12 and 6, as well we have anyone who gets holy fired move close to the edge of the platform she's on to assure they're in Los of the dispellers.<br />
<br />
More often than not when someone dies to holy fire for us its because of Los issues with the priest.<br />
<br />
As well, using vent helps alot since the person with holy fire can just call it out as soon as it lands and get it cleansed quickly.</div></div><hr />
