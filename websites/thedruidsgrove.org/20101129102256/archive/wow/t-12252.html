Guess popin' trinkets at the beginning of a battle doesn't make much sense now.  Doesn't this also mean that you'll want to wait until right at the end of the 7s timer before casting a re-fresh otherwise you'd have wasted some of the +healing you may have had on earlier stacks?</div></div><hr />

Will we get the nice bump from say +500 HPS to +700 HPS consantly?  No, but we can also pop trinkets mid battle to up our healing for a good bit of time.  For me that's more valuable because when my bonus wears out in the middle of a fight (because stupid maiden stunned me...) then I have to decide wether to let it expire and pop trinkets again or wether to keep going.  At least now I can pop the trinkets whenever I need them to boost my healing for a time.  Either way we are extremely mana efficient with those heals.  Letting a Lifebloom stack expire wastes' a ton of mana efficiency.</div></div><hr />

Unless your refresh has more +healing than the existing stack.<br />
<br />
It is not real clear (though I assume it to be true), does the entire stack of 3 lifeblooms take on the new +healing value?  Or just the oldest one on the stack?</div></div><hr />

I'm not for it (because I play a resto druid =D ) but I'm definitely not against it. Basically use +heal could nearly become the same as +heal if you can keep lifeblooms up =/</div></div><hr />

Ideally the +healing of the entire 3 stacks will be whatever the +healing of the most recently cast lifebloom was.  That to me would be the most balanced and the most logical way for the mechanic to work.<br />
<br />
When this change hits I'm gonna find a friendly tank and get him to tank a fel reaver for 10 minutes while I experiment on him.  I'll report my findings back here.  :&gt;<br />

I totally expected them to make this fix. I'm just surprised its taken them this long.</div></div><hr />

Seems like only the one you replaced should be affected by the new +healing.</div></div><hr />

I'll be able to pop a trinket mid-fight, and I'll actually see the effect on my lifebloom casts without having to let my current stack expire first.   =)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure that's how the stack mechanics work. I'd be more than happy for it to affect the full stack. More power to the trinkets, imho. As Sey said, it'll be nice to pop-it mid fight and not have to worry about expiring Lifebloom out.</div></div><hr />
