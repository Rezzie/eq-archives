<br />
After looking at Imp. Leader of the Pack's description, I have to wonder if it is all that useful while solo leveling?  I was thinking of taking 3/3 Survival of the Fittest and 1/1 Feral Charge as my 4 &quot;backfill&quot; talent points after Leader of the Pack on my way toward Mangle at level 50.  I'd continue to fill-out the Restro tree until I get OOC (at level 61).  Then, with my remaining points fill in Imp LotP, Thick Hide and Intensity.<br />
<br />
Now that I look at it, maybe I'll put 1/2 in Imp LotP rather than taking Feral Charge.  FC seems like a great tanking ability, but I doubt it all that useful while leveling.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, switching out of cat form and throwing up a rejuvination every couple mobs does the trick.  ILotP allows me to maybe go one more mob without having to switch out and heal (which can be done while running to the next one anyways).<br />
<br />
In a group with melee players or even while tanking, I love the ability though.  But if you aren't tanking instances and aren't grouping with other physical damage dealers (i.e. solo questing), you could skip it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i found it to go alot faster when i can stay shifted and just let these keep me at full health, less time shifting to cast, lest time sitting waiting on mana, less time wasting mana/heal pots</div></div><hr />

I know one of my first missions once I reach the Outlands is to begin the daily PvP quest to get my Mark of Conquest (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27920).</div></div><hr />

I hate PVP, so I've avoided doing the Mark quests, but I may have to with that in mind.Most of the time there is rarely any PvP conflict while doing this quest as the other faction wants to complete it as badly as you do.  Before it was a daily quest, I earned the 30 marks with two  characters in about 2hrs each.  Now that it will take 10 days!:banghead: <br />
<br />
The only time I have issues with PvP is if the other faction has significantly more players (3-5 more) than your faction completing the quest.<br />
<br />
I know you also play a hunter.  This is the best questing trinket in the game for a hunter.  It results in something like 35-60 MP5 while questing.  Which means you almost never run out of mana, even if you go crazy and do the back-to-back-to-back-to-back pull thing.</div></div><hr />

I'll start a new thead for discussion of Mark of Conquest quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weaselking1973</div><div class="date">08-28-2007, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the easy way to build your marks is just get the quest from honor hold.  and wait till about 6-8 server time.<br />
<br />
thats when people show up and it turns to a chain event..<br />
<br />
1 mark per kill<br />
3 marks for finishing the quest...<br />
<br />
1 hour you can get 10-20 of them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">08-28-2007, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that's pretty much what I did - Got all 3 captures and a kill this morning when almost no one was on right before server shut down.<br />
<br />
Then tonight after work played for about a half hour as part of a group engaging a higher level but smaller in number group of allies.  6 kills there.<br />
<br />
10 marks in a day - I'll have that Mark of Conquest in no time at this rate.<br />
<br />
And I even had fun PVPing.  Who'da thunk it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
theres a few nifty spots you can hide on top and prowl (gotta fly to get to them)<br />
<br />
then pounce on them from above when they all alone and trying to take the area</div></div><hr />
