Unreal.<br />
Just thought i'd let anyone know that doesnt.</div></div><hr />

Everyone but Ferals are having that bonus removed with the next patch.<br />
<br />
And Ferals get it removed from Travel Form.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Birdbear</div><div class="date">02-20-2008, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah yeah thats fine, although i heard that ferals ARE getting it for travel form.  As i understood the latest patch notes the 4 piece bonus's in 2.4 will be as follows:<br />
feral = 15% speed (as it is now) for cat/bear/travel<br />
resto = -.2seconds off regrowth<br />
balance = wrath has a chance (20%?) to make your next starfire 1.5 seconds faster.<br />
<br />
I will gladly lose that &quot;fun&quot; buff i get for 1 second starfires!!</div></div><hr />

I think feral would be pretty gimped without the bonus on travel and bear form though. <br />
<br />
Last I heard they were going to increase the speed to 20% for cat but were removing travel and bear bonuses, but the origional set bonus is much better imo.</div></div><hr />

Resto get -.2 seconds off regrowth<br />
balance gives wrath a chance (~20%) to make your next starfire 1.5 seconds less (OP!?!?!?)</div></div><hr />

This sucks. I think druid healers will have a hard time now in arenas with this change. It will get really difficult to get away from a rogue now....</div></div><hr />
