Someone is paying an homage indeed!  Please note the references to Gosselin and Paldor.  The name of the books (which include six volumes) are &quot;Liber Brassica Felix&quot; which a kind fella on EQ Traders mentioned is Latin for &quot;Book of Lucky Cabbage.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I am updating this post with the full text of the recipe books in order as they become available.  We are missing volumes 5, 7 and 8.<br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 1<br />
<br />
I have not always run this Inn.<br />
In times a-passed, I was much more thin!<br />
In these works I shall recount my tale,<br />
On pages extant, lest my memory fail ...<br />
Once during every thousand years,<br />
Throughout the shards, across the spheres,<br />
The planets into alignment fall.<br />
Through unseen barriers, laws do stall:<br />
Upon each shard - a sacred Wood.<br />
The realities bend, and 'twixt them could<br />
A faithful spirit through them travel,<br />
Into neighbouring worlds; and space unravel. <br />
My tale is of one time now passed.<br />
When the Blessed Grove of each world touched last:<br />
Priests of Nature, from every sphere,<br />
For a brief time, met without slightest fear.<br />
Strangers all, they came as one,<br />
To praise their Gods, and tell of victories won ...<br />
A throng of Nature's priests did meet.<br />
In that Sacred Grove, and each other greet.<br />
As if they had known one another forever.<br />
Perhaps kindred spirits, apart but never<br />
Separate - united by their art,<br />
Each a single facet of Nature's part.<br />
<br />
After feasting, and much merriment,<br />
There came a silence, exuberance all spent.<br />
'Twas the ritual Sacrifice's time,<br />
And the purpose of this humble rhyme.<br />
Heed these words, for should ye follow<br />
In their wake, and not in tawdriness wallow,<br />
Thou shalt perhaps catch eye of higher powers,<br />
Whom look down upon our mortal hours,<br />
And in sacrificing, as did we that night,<br />
Blessings to ye,m impart they might.<br />
About ye thy sharpest wits do keep!<br />
'Til Sacrifice is made, restless be thy sleep!<br />
<br />
For now, ensure to pay closest heed,<br />
For upon these pages, the secret ye shall read,<br />
As to the Sacrifice's construction.<br />
And so, to work ye go, after some deduction.<br />
Keep handy ye store of scholarly wits,<br />
For in tongues quite foreign are these writs,<br />
So from the Heathern to safe-guard,<br />
The hidden knowledge - by study hard,<br />
Thou shalt the Naturewalker's Tale unfold,<br />
And to the eventual Sacrifice travel bold.<br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 2<br />
<br />
Nine offerings were made to the Powers,<br />
Each symbolizing toil of mortal hours,<br />
Three times three, created by mortals,<br />
Burned at once, in the Grove between portals,<br />
Three given by Elvenkind fair,<br />
Delicate offerings worked with care,<br />
<br />
Three from noble Humanity's kin,<br />
Each festive creation ushered in,<br />
And three from Karana's favored race,<br />
Fitting tribute to their Lord's smiling face,<br />
First came the priests from Elven lands,<br />
Their three gifts held in whitened hands...<br />
<br />
There came a tall elf named Sylvaned Tree,<br />
Carrying a bottle bigger even then me!<br />
Of workmanship it was most refined,<br />
the jewelled bottle well definied.<br />
The bottle itself was first created,<br />
from magical gold, with opal mated,<br />
<br />
With a glass bottle, by jeweller skilled,<br />
what gorgeous craft with drink to be filled.<br />
Once bottle crafted, now came this brew:<br />
Using the magnum, wine yeast, and double grapes too,<br />
With a little soda water mixed to taste,<br />
Not a drop of liquid gone to waste.<br />
<br />
With these fine ingrediants five,<br />
The result was a champagne for which to strive!<br />
In order to mix the soda water,<br />
Ye should seek out Mudhand's Daughter.<br />
Thus water and soda should ye simply mix,<br />
To produce more fizz than Fizzlepop's six!<br />
<br />
The elves do brewing in varying strengths,<br />
adding more or less grapes, such lengths!<br />
However this drink requires grapes just two,<br />
Though using one or three can taste fine too.<br />
With gift upon the fire overturned,<br />
Back to the throng Silvered Tree returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 3<br />
<br />
Then came the second Elven gift,<br />
A sacred sickle with poise and lift.<br />
A smiling elf stepping out from the band,<br />
Named Summer Sirocco, after warm wind's hand.<br />
From three main parts were made his Sickle,<br />
All forged together with hammer fickle.<br />
<br />
First I must tell you of captured essence,<br />
So that what follows makes more sense.<br />
Across the worlds there are scattered,<br />
Runes, words and other magicks mattered.<br />
Here in Fungus Caves can be found,<br />
A Celestial Solvent, from elf-girl bound.<br />
<br />
Place a vial of this within a mortar,<br />
And grind in rune, or word, without water.<br />
The result is purest magic's flavor,<br />
With many uses, ye shall savour.<br />
One such use is in powder blessing:<br />
Imbue the Elf-deity's gem with Tunarean tressing.<br />
<br />
With this gem, and acid, and magical essence,<br />
Fire in a kiln, to release the magical presence/<br />
For each of the Sickle's three main parts,<br />
The process is similar, say truest hearts:<br />
Each main part is made of Seven:<br />
Dust blessed from Tunare's Heaven.<br />
<br />
Your hammer, and a metal sheet,<br />
Celestial Essence and a temper meet,<br />
A gem - one from red, green or blue,<br />
And finally the correct Mold too.<br />
Whether making blade, hilt or pommel, choose thy Mold,<br />
And the correct product shall ye behold.<br />
<br />
The temper of which I have said,<br />
Is brewed from Elf-wine, coloured red,<br />
Mixed with Magical Essence but,<br />
Also add a sprig of the leaf that the Sickle shall cut.<br />
From these three can the temper be made,<br />
With which this Sickle's game is played.<br />
<br />
With the offering place upon the fire,<br />
So to the crowd did Summer Sirocco retire. <br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 4<br />
<br />
From the kilns of Kelethin came offering third,<br />
A prayer to the Goddess then was heard,<br />
From the lip of she name Fox's Fyre came,<br />
Hymns sung in the Elf-Queen's name.<br />
As the gathering sung in a single voice,<br />
Upon the fire was placed the Elf druid's choice: <br />
A shining Idol of Tunare, golden<br />
From potter's hands, this product molden.<br />
Eight constituents for this are needed,<br />
To my earlier words I trust ya heeded!<br />
Take magic's essence, and water flask,<br />
And a sizeable block of magical clay for this task,<br />
<br />
With a sketch of the idol, too,<br />
A lump of gold, and Emerald Imbue,<br />
With Distilled Mana and your sculpting tool,<br />
Place on thy Potter's Wheel, as normal rule.<br />
When ready to firm the clay at fiery heat,<br />
Use a Godly glaze, and adequate firing sheet.<br />
<br />
With practiced skill and some luck,<br />
From the kiln's flames the Idol might you pluck.<br />
Also made by the Potters of Kelethin precarious,<br />
Other Idols, for deities various.<br />
It is said that each uses a differing stone,<br />
Though this is knowledge that I do not own.<br />
<br />
And so it was that the Elf-gits Three,<br />
Were all upon the fire beneath the Great Tree.<br />
The sun that had lit the Grove so far,<br />
Sunk beneath the trees, and so we saw a Star,<br />
A sign that the Powers' now did glance,<br />
Down upon the Congregation's dance. <br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix v. 5<br />
<br />
Next came the three gifts from the druid of man,<br />
Fashioned according to their traditional plan.<br />
Wonders of strange metals are they,<br />
Some in the coldest land, velium workers, they say.<br />
In the manufacture of even the smallest bits,<br />
The creation of temper tested their wits.<br />
<br />
Though not solved, this course to thee I show,<br />
So that in the right direction might ye go.<br />
Brew together magical essences four, <br />
And into that mix a special drink they pour:<br />
Crated by human settlers in the Ice Land<br />
Explorers, brave adventurers, and<br />
<br />
Made from Allspice; water ye will also need<br />
With some brown form of native seaweed.<br />
Using a small glass, you Heater is created,<br />
Upon which the strongest tastebud can be sated!<br />
However, ye shall use it to mix, as I have said,<br />
with magical essences four, as you have read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here&quot;. said the first druid of Man.<br />
Here is your gift, but I won't like your plan!&quot;<br />
With fiery tempter and eyes alight,<br />
From the one named Gosselin many took fright.<br />
&quot;There are ways and means for druid life,<br />
My way is the right way, al else is strife!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unto the fire he placed an object strange.<br />
'Twas a fishing rod, with incredible range.<br />
The spool was smithed by the look,<br />
Two velium bits and sandalwood I think it took.<br />
Then, so strong and pliant the cord,<br />
What incredible fabric could this afford?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a cord made entirely of silk,<br />
and treated by tailor, maybe of that ilk.<br />
It would take the largest egg ye could find<br />
Then brewed into oil, if I used my mind.<br />
Use that egg's oil with silk cord to treat.<br />
That would be the line - it would be quite a feat.<br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix v.6.<br />
<br />
Place the line and the spool into a box of tackle,<br />
Then, and this is the part as cunning as the jackal,<br />
Add in a single magical essence vial,<br />
And a small blessed Karana-dust pile.<br />
The fifth and last item to place in there, <br />
Is the bracnh of a sacred tree - but from where? <br />
It looks otherworldy, as from a spot,<br />
That is of Norrath and mortal places not.<br />
From these components five, I think one could fashion,<br />
That magical rod, cast on the fire with passion.<br />
Unto the crowd, did Gosselin glare;<br />
He stepped back, raise to him none would dare.<br />
<br />
Second from Men came a curious Stein,<br />
It certainly looked like nothing of mine.<br />
It was as if a Potter had taken,<br />
Magical essence, and water if I'm not mistaken.<br />
Along with his tools, and a ceramic sketched,<br />
With some magical clay and then fetched,<br />
A lacquered star ruby, but what is this stone?<br />
Perhaps a jeweller could make that alone:<br />
A little lacquer, and the gem, in his kit;<br />
I'm sure that would be a suitable fit.<br />
Use all six on the Potter's Wheel,<br />
Then fire in the Kiln, however you feel.<br />
Carried by Paldor, a druid so tall,<br />
Steins made from other stones are within his thrall.<br />
In order to make the sacrifice ripe,<br />
Thou shouldst use the star ruby type.<br />
And so with a win Paldor retook his place,<br />
Amongst the singing crowd, a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Bassica Felix Vol. 7<br />
<br />
The came the third and final gift of Man,<br />
Brought by Running Wolf, but where had he ran?<br />
A strange name for a druid fine,<br />
He closely resembled a friend of mine.<br />
The gifst was a Robe, so well made and sewn,<br />
If I were a taller, I'd have one of my own!<br />
<br />
The neckpiece was silver, smithed with skill;<br />
Magical silver, metal bits and water to fill.<br />
Then, gems of the primary colours and that chain -<br />
A jeweller had clearly crafted one main.<br />
With pieces of Tunarean silk - perhaps three,<br />
A tailor had sewn the robe, I could see,<br />
<br />
Also using a pattern, and the gemmed chain,<br />
And a magical needle, or I am not sane!<br />
Those basic ingredients six went to form,<br />
The luxuriant robe, honourably worn.<br />
Upon the magical silk, I then did wonder,<br />
A process exact, one cannot blunder!<br />
<br />
Combing a swatch of silk, and magical essence,<br />
And a pinch of Tunarean dust would make sense.<br />
The magical needle, now there is a thought -<br />
I think from a mold and metal bits is it wrought;<br />
Magical essence and water don't forget to include,<br />
Then smith in the forge whenever is your mood!<br />
<br />
So mankind and elfkind their gifts are given,<br />
By love of their Gods to their arts driven.<br />
A second star appeared brightly in the sky,<br />
As if the opening of another deity's eye;<br />
And so, to those of Karan's humble folk,<br />
To the duty of sacrifice, passion awoke!<br />
<br />
Sorrun, brave halfling, he held high,<br />
What appeared to be a sumptuous pie!<br />
So fitting for the halfling kin,<br />
There is no doubt he is far from thin!<br />
The pie smelled divine, made from good dough,<br />
A good shaped pie tin; the filling though<br />
<br />
It seemed familiar, as if it were a paste,<br />
Created from vile plants in my Caverns, make haste!<br />
Stay them well, and mix them with flour,<br />
And cream and allspice, a taste to devour! <br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 8<br />
(reposted from EQ Traders, thank you Niami)<br />
<br />
Volume 8:<br />
<br />
Such a wonderful pie, all the halflings agreed,<br />
All eyes on the crust, so great was our need!<br />
That gift delivered, it was my wish,<br />
To give to Karana our customary dish;<br />
My eyes well up, tis how strongly I feel,<br />
When I contemplated this epic meal.<br />
<br />
Listen closely, and I shall teach you the making,<br />
Though it requires much study of baking!<br />
The Picnic is something that we all adore,<br />
One always desires to have just a little more!<br />
<br />
Eight components there are to this feast,<br />
The first, a cheese, is but the least.<br />
Add mints, salad and jumjum spiced beer,<br />
And two slices of jumjum cake, nothing to fear!<br />
And the eighth is a basket, bringing up the rear.<br />
<br />
The most widely known is the jumjum cake,<br />
From usual methods, add jumjum, to make!<br />
Mints are simple, and can be made by the sheaf,<br />
Just mix frosting with a eucalyptus leaf!<br />
<br />
Now listen closely for brewing of spiced beer - <br />
Barley, hops, spices and jumjum you shall need near!<br />
Mix in some water, and into a bottle pour;<br />
The salad requires ingrediants (sic) four:<br />
<br />
Lettuce, and fennel, vegetables and jumjum,<br />
Tasty on its own, sometimes nice with rum!<br />
Mix three frostings and a fruit portion,<br />
Creates a spread quite lovely, use caution!<br />
<br />
Mix it with bread and a sandwich you'll find.<br />
That's for the picnic, if you've been left behind!<br />
Weave two mandrake roots together, task it!<br />
Then sew in some boning: your picnic basket!<br />
<br />
A meal so good, a while it takes to eat,<br />
More than a food, a religious treat! <br />
<br />
<br />
Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 9 <br />
<br />
A final gift of Karana's kind.<br />
What other treat could I possibly find?<br />
Something worthy of his attention.<br />
What better symbol could I mention!<br />
From my backpack I then withdrew,<br />
My old talisman, that's seen me through,<br />
Adventures of all kinds, when I were young,<br />
And with the brave and foolish fought among.<br />
The Lucky Cabbage, my faithful friend,<br />
That's been with me until the end!<br />
And then to the Elder Gods I did proffer,<br />
The ninth of Nine, the final offer. <br />
A cabbage of your own you can enchant,<br />
Sprinkle dust upon the wild cabbage plant.<br />
Magical essence, acid, pebble from the plains,<br />
To place in the kiln is all that remains.<br />
Thus your blessed dust created,<br />
Your craving for Lucky Cabbage sated.<br />
<br />
The fire in the Grove roared high,<br />
Its flames touching the ebon sky,<br />
The Gods then did upon us shine,<br />
What they revealed I shall keep mine.<br />
<br />
However, you can perhaps try too,<br />
By making the Nine sacrificing true,<br />
In a fiery furnace of suitable heat,<br />
A smiths forge, perhaps, your needs will meet,<br />
<br />
Remember that the Gods are always looking,<br />
Make well thy sewing, and fair thy cooking!<br />
For those of you bold and adequately plucky,<br />
Come and try thy skills, if ye feelst lucky.<br />
<br />
Such endless talk will wear me thin.<br />
I shall sleep now, and return to my Inn.<br />

<br />
Then came the second Elven gift,<br />
A sacred sickle with poist and life.<br />
A smithing elf stepped out from the band<br />
Named Summer Sirocco after warm wind's hand.<br />
<br />
First I must tell you of celestial essence<br />
So that follows makes mores sense.<br />
Across the worlds there are scattered<br />
Runes, words and other magical mattered.<br />
Here in the Fungus Cave can be found<br />
A Celestial Solvent from elf-girl young.<br />
<br />
Place a vial of this within a mortar<br />
And grind in rune or word without water.<br />
The result is purest magical flavour<br />
with many uses we shall savour.<br />
One such use is in powder blessing<br />
Imbue the elf diety's gem with Tunarean's dressing.<br />
<br />
With the gem, add acid and magical essence.<br />
Fire in a kilm to release the magical presence.<br />
For each of the sickle's three main parts<br />
The process is similar, say trues hearts.<br />
Each main part is made of seven: <br />
Dust blessed from Tunare's Heaven,<br />
<br />
Your hammer and a metal sheet,<br />
Celestial essence and tempter meet,<br />
A gem - one from red, green or blue<br />
and finally the correct mold, too.<br />
Whether making blade, hilt or pommel choose the mold<br />
And the correct product ye shall behold.<br />
<br />
The temper of which I have said<br />
Is brewed from elf-wine, coloured red.<br />
Mixed with with celestial essence, but<br />
Also add a sprig of the leaf that the sickle shall cut.<br />
From these three can the temper be made<br />
with which the sickles game is played.<br />
<br />
With the offering placed upon the fire<br />
In to the crowd did Summer Sirocco retire.<br />
<br />
_________________________________________<br />
Possible Recipes:<br />
<br />
Celestial Essence - Solvent + any word/rune combined in mortar = Celestial Essence (?)<br />
<br />
'Powder blessing' - Essence + imbued Tunare gem (I worship Karana -- don't know if it will work with plains pebble) + Acid fired in kiln = [unknown]. <br />
<br />
Scythe - Dust blessed from Tunare's Heaven [above powder blessing?] + Hammer + Metal Sheet [unknown quality] + Celestial Essence + temper + 'A gem - one from red, green or blue' + mold [hilt, pommel, blade] combine in forge = [unknown hilt, pommel, blade]<br />
<br />
Doesn't really explain what you do with the three products, so I assume you but the three back inside the forge and try to combine<br />
<br />
Temper - Red Elf wine + 'a sprig of the leaf that the sickle shall cut' [cabbage?] + Celestial essence = [unknown temper]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am all for quests and puzzles, but to have to do a puzzle and then go sit in front of a forge for 8 hours does not require intelligence or ingenuity. Farming silk for tailoring so I can work on a shawl quest is not really questing either... it sitting in areas that lower level could be getting exps monopolizing spawns. No I dont do that, but we all know plenty of others do and VIs &quot;tradeskill quests&quot; that are of value to high level players - shawl, PotC (if smithing is required), etc - not only encourage that but require it.<br />
<br />
Pop into CC the next week and see how the level 30s feel about all the 7th shawl owners there farming the place so they can now do the 8th... the one that wasnt going to require any more tradeskills. lol<br />
<br />
Quests = good<br />
Tradeskill timesinks = bad<br />
<br />
Ok so 3 books and all various languages.. <br />
<br />
book 2 was the champagne one or was that book 1?<br />
book 3 was the one referencing smithing, I heard it was in orc?<br />
<br />
Blah I cant get online and work on this now /sigh</div></div><hr />

And <br />
<br />
<br />
With the offering placed upon the fire<br />

Each one ends with place the correct item - Karana: magical rod &amp; Tunare: magical sickle - as an offering in some type of fire.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you GET the spell after finishing the item and then offering it to an NPC.<br />
<br />
I am confused by the Karana one... it seems incomplete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The two from Men we know about appear to be a Rod and a Stein. One of the Elven gifts is a Sickle.  That means we're missing 6.<br />
<br />
The reference to a fire sounds like we turn in all gifts at the end.  Perhaps there is some &quot;fire&quot; NPC (like the NPC triggers or trap triggers) on PoG?</div></div><hr />

Translation of Liber Brassica Felix Vol. 2(Felwithe)<br />
<br />
&quot;Nine offerings were made to the Powers,<br />
Each symbolizing toil of mortal hours,<br />
Three times three, created by mortals,<br />
Burned at once, in the Grove between portals,<br />
Three given by Elvenkind fair,<br />
Delicate offerings worked with care,<br />
<br />
Three from noble Humanity's kin,<br />
Each festive creation ushered in,<br />
And three from Karana's favored race,<br />
Fitting tribute to their Lord's smiling face,<br />
First came the priests from Elven lands,<br />
Their three gifts held in whitened hands...<br />
<br />
There came a tall elf named Sylvaned Tree,<br />
Carrying a bottle bigger even then me!<br />
Of workmanship it was most refined,<br />
the jewelled bottle well definied.<br />
The bottle itself was first created,<br />
from magical gold, with opal mated,<br />
<br />
With a glass bottle, by jeweller skilled,<br />
what gorgeous craft with drink to be filled.<br />
Once bottle crafted, now came this brew:<br />
Using the magnum, wine yeast, and double grapes too,<br />
With a little soda water mixed to taste,<br />
Not a drop of liquid gone to waste.<br />
<br />
With these fine ingrediants five,<br />
The result was a champagne for which to strive!<br />
In order to mix the soda water,<br />
Ye should seek out Mudhand's Daughter.<br />
Thus water and soda should ye simply mix,<br />
To produce more fizz than Fizzlepop's six!<br />
<br />
The elves do brewing in varying strengths,<br />
adding more or less grapes, such lengths!<br />
However this drink requires grapes just two,<br />
Though using one or three can taste fine too.<br />
With gift upon the fire overturned,<br />
Back to the throng Silvered Tree returned.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not always run this Inn.<br />
In times a-passed, I was much more thin!<br />
In these works I shall recount my tale,<br />
On pages extant, lest my memory fail ...<br />
Once during every thousand years,<br />
Throughout the shards, across the spheres,<br />
The planets into alignment fall.<br />
Through unseen barriers, laws do stall:<br />
Upon each shard - a sacred Wood.<br />
The realities bend, and 'twixt them could<br />
A faithful spirit through them travel,<br />
Into neighbouring worlds; and space unravel.<br />
<br />
My tale is of one time now passed.<br />
When the Blessed Grove of each world touched last:<br />
Priests of Nature, from every sphere,<br />
For a brief time, met without slightest fear.<br />
Strangers all, they came as one,<br />
To praise their Gods, and tell of victories won ...<br />
A throng of Nature's priests did meet.<br />
In that Sacred Grove, and each other greet.<br />
As if they had known one another forever.<br />
Perhaps kindred spirits, apart but never<br />
Separate - united by their art,<br />
Each a single facet of Nature's part.<br />
<br />
After feasting, and much merriment,<br />
There came a silence, exuberance all spent.<br />
'Twas the ritual Sacrifice's time,<br />
And the purpose of this humble rhyme.<br />
Heed these words, for should ye follow<br />
In their wake, and not in tawdriness wallow,<br />
Thou shalt perhaps catch eye of higher powers,<br />
Whom look down upon our mortal hours,<br />
And in sacrificing, as did we that night,<br />
Blessings to ye,m impart they might.<br />
About ye thy sharpest wits do keep!<br />
'Til Sacrifice is made, restless be thy sleep!<br />
<br />
For now, ensure to pay closest heed,<br />
For upon these pages, the secret ye shall read,<br />
As to the Sacrifice's construction.<br />
And so, to work ye go, after some deduction.<br />
Keep handy ye store of scholarly wits,<br />
For in tongues quite foreign are these writs,<br />
So from the Heathern to safe-guard,<br />
The hidden knowledge - by study hard,<br />
Thou shalt the Naturewalker's Tale unfold,<br />
And to the eventual Sacrifice travel bold.</div></div><hr />

  Just wanted to drop you guys a quick note to say the Protection of the<br />
Cabbage quest went live this patch.  It's a quest with a heavy tradeskill<br />
portion, but all of the ingredients you need for the final combine are<br />
buyable and tradeable, so non-tradeskill inclined people can barter for the<br />
things they need instead of making them.  I'd hoped to get this into the<br />
patch message, but it slipped through with all of the other things going in<br />
this time.  Sorry bout that.<br />

Volume 5 - Rough translation<br />
<br />
Next came the three gifts from the druids of Man,<br />
Fashioned according to their traditional plan.<br />
Wonders of strange metals are they,<br />
Some in the coldest land, velium workers, they say.<br />
In the manufacture of even the smallest bits,<br />
The creation of temper tested their wits.<br />
<br />
Though not solved, this course to thee I show,<br />
So that in the right direction might ye go.<br />
Brew together magical essences four, <br />
And into that mix a special drink they pour:<br />
Crated by human settlers in the Ice Land<br />
Explorers, brave adventurers, and<br />
<br />
Made from Allspice; water ye will also need<br />
With some brown form of native seaweed.<br />
Using a small glass, you Heater is created,<br />
Upon which the strongest tastebud can be sated!<br />
However, ye shall use it to mix, as I have said,<br />
with magical essences four, as you have read.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen here&quot;. said the first druid of Man.<br />
Here is your gift, but I won't like your plan!&quot;<br />
With fiery tempter and eyes alight,<br />
From the one named Gosselin many took fright.<br />
&quot;There are ways and means for druid life,<br />
My way is the right way, al else is strife!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unto the fire he placed an object strange.<br />
'Twas a fishing rod, with incredible range.<br />
The spool was smithed by the look,<br />
Two velium bits and sandalwood I think it took.<br />
Then, so strong and pliant the cord,<br />
What incredible fabric could this afford?<br />
<br />
Perhaps a cord made entirely of silk,<br />
and treated by tailor, maybe of that ilk.<br />
It would take the larges egg ye could find<br />
Then brewed into oil, if I used my mind.<br />
Use that egg's oil with silk cord to treat.<br />
That would be the line - it would be quite a feat.<br />
<br />
Recipes-<br />
<br />
<br />
1 Water + 1 Allspice + 1 Brown Algae + Shotglass = Coldain Heater [Confirmed by EQTraders]<br />
<br />
1 Coldain Heater + 4 Celestial Essence = Coldain Velium Temper! [confirmed by EQTraders]<br />
<br />
Two velium bits + sandalwood = XXX spool [cannot remember exact name, but was NOT trivial at 81- got a skillup infact]<br />
<br />
Foraged dragon egg + water = Dragon egg oil [Confirmed]<br />
<br />
Silk cord + Dragon egg oil = Treated Silk Fibers [Confirmed - Trivial at 157]<br />
<br />
Smithed spool+ Treated Silk Fibers + Blessed Dust of Karana + Planar oak from PoG = Blessed Fishing Rod [confirmed by EQTraders]</div></div><hr />

EDIT: Add this in (found on eqtraders.com) and I'm not sure if you can just buy the temper to do this:<br />
<br />
Read the transcript of Book 5, and had a bit of a think. And the recipe works like this!<br />
<br />
1 Water + 1 Allspice + 1 Brown Algae + Shotglass = Coldain Heater<br />
<br />
1 Coldain Heater + 4 Celestial Essence = COLDAIN VELIUM TEMPER! WOOT!<br />
<br />
Both trivial at 200 skill or below. Can I get a WOOT?!<br />

Yes it's a whole pile of arsing around, but still...:) <br />

What we really needed was a single target equivalent of BAoTR that can stack with mass-group-buff aegolism (but not focus).  From the looks of it this grants 400+ hps or something so I doubt it stacks -- ideally everyone would get mass buff aegolism, then melees would stack focus and casters either their self-buff (mages and clerics) or PoTC on top.</div></div><hr />

VI did something very similar with the Vah'Shir mega-quest, which requires each Vah'Shir class to master a different tradeskill and then swap the items made. The differences with the PotC quest are (1) you don't have to master any tradeskill if you don't want to, and (2) the result is actually useful, unlike the crappy weapons from the other quest. So cheer up... it could be worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm beyond incoherent right now, as this quest is just one of many, many, many recipes that I'm trying to document right now, but I wanted to stop in and say hello.<br />
<br />
I've scrounged *some* information from here, but most of my data is going to come from my own message boards, just because of time constraints.<br />
<br />
If you want to see the result of all of my scrounging, feel free to stop by www.eqtraders.com/secrets..._liber.htm (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_may8_liber.htm)<br />
<br />
If someone can post over on the following thread when you decipher something new, I'll be glad to add it to the above compilation.  The more folks working on this from both the wonderful druid community here, and the tradeskill community I've got going, the faster we'll get all this sorted out for you folks (and for our own curiousity).<br />

Meanwhile, I do have one tidbit to contribute.  I managed to make the spool for the fishing pole (volumes 5 &amp; 6) ... however, it's no drop. (wah!) ... confirmed: 2 velium bits, 1 sandalwood (from an alchemy vendor)<br />

Well, some of the items as intermediary steps are things that us nondruid tradeskillers are going to adore. (speaking as all the me's other than my 55 druid who did the unding/reding dance while getting me a branch of planar oak for the cleric me to test the fishing pole)<br />

Well, sorry to barge in again, but there are a few things that constitute pretty good proof that this quest is for our POTC spell. <br />

In the high elf forge? And why would a spell scroll need to be made in a forge? I think an earlier poster was onto something. Maybe there is a super item that is the result of this quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such a wonderful pie, all the halflings agreed,<br />
All eyes on the crust, so great was our need!<br />
That gift delivered, it was my wish,<br />
To give to Karana our customary dish;<br />
My eyes well up, tis how strongly I feel,<br />
When I contemplated this epic meal.<br />
<br />
Listen closely, and I shall teach you the making,<br />
Though it requires much study of baking!<br />
The Picnic is something that we all adore,<br />
One always desires to have just a little more!<br />
<br />
Eight components there are to this feast,<br />
The first, a cheese, is but the least.<br />
Add mints, salad and jumjum spiced beer,<br />
And two slices of jumjum cake, nothing to fear!<br />
And the eighth is a basket, bringing up the rear.<br />
<br />
The most widely known is the jumjum cake,<br />
From usual methods, add jumjum, to make!<br />
Mints are simple, and can be made by the sheaf,<br />
Just mix frosting with a eucalyptus leaf!<br />
<br />
Now listen closely for brewing of spiced beer - <br />
Barley, hops, spices and jumjum you shall need near!<br />
Mix in some water, and into a bottle pour;<br />
The salad requires ingrediants (sic) four:<br />
<br />
Lettuce, and fennel, vegetables and jumjum,<br />
Tasty on its own, sometimes nice with rum!<br />
Mix three frostings and a fruit portion,<br />
Creates a spread quite lovely, use caution!<br />
<br />
Mix it with bread and a sandwich you'll find.<br />
That's for the picnic, if you've been left behind!<br />
Weave two mandrake roots together, task it!<br />
Then sew in some boning: your picnic basket!<br />
<br />
A meal so good, a while it takes to eat,<br />
More than a food, a religious treat!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, this must trivial rather low.  of 16 attempts so far, I have succeeded 7 times and I'm a Druid -- NOT a rogue.<br />
<br />
The Mortar &amp; Pestal are the POISON making type.  Not the mortar used with pottery.<br />
<br />
On the runs words and pages...  Sorry I didn't keep the list of attempts that worked and the DNC's (Did not Combine).<br />
<br />
Value wasn't the determining factor.  I had those words that look like the card (words of Binding or some such) combine and they were cheap vs some of the others.  Page 117 (I think) combined whereas 301 didn't.<br />
<br />
I'm building up to try the sythe.  I got a nice elf Druid to imbue 5 emeralds for me so far and I'll be stocking up on stuff to check it out...  <br />
<br />
As for those that whine about trade skill quests being nasty -- sorry but such things ARE fun when you are into them.  You figure that getting up 2 to 3 groups to go hunt and kill something to loot something else...  Enjoy your style of fun, I'll stick with one that I can get into.</div></div><hr />

After I got done translating book 8 and posting it, I looked at what was needed and rubbed my hands with glee.  A couple hours later, I was pulling out my hair as the first combine was a flop, but I'd fortunately snagged a couple extra groundspawns to re-make the ingredients I'd lost.<br />
<br />
Here's the breakdown:<br />
<br />
***NOTE: for the jumjum required here, only the jumjum stalk that is a ground spawn in Rivervale works. The vendor sold version of the same name &quot;jumjum stalk&quot; is returning a DNC**<br />
<br />
<br />
mature cheese: milk, rennet, dairy spoon (mix in mixing bowl) <br />
<br />
royal mints: frosting, eucalyptus leaf (in mixing bowl), trivial &lt;=99, yield 2<br />
<br />
jumjum spiced beer: barley, hops, spices, jumjum stalk, water, bottle (mix in brew barrel)<br />
<br />
apricot marmalade: 3 frosting, foraged fruit (combine in spit/oven, yield 6)<br />
<br />
marmalade sandwich: loaf of bread, apricot marmalade (combine in mixing bowl)<br />
<br />
jumjum salad: lettuce, fennel, jumjum stalk, vegetables (combine in mixing bowl), yield 4<br />
<br />
woven mandrake: 2 mandrake roots (combine in sewing kit), trivial &lt;=250<br />
<br />
picnic basket: woven mandrake, boning - item is a snack (combine in sewing kit), trivial &lt;=250<br />
<br />
jumjum cake: jumjum stalk, frosting, clump of dough, winter chocolate, cake round - yield 2<br />
<br />
slices of jumjum cake: jumjum cake (combine in spit or oven) - yield 10 slices<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket picnic: mature cheese, royal mints, jumjum salad, jumjum spiced beer, marmalade sandwich, picnic basket, 2 slices jumjum cake - yield 2, miraculous meal, STR 5, STA 5, WIS 5, INT 5<br />

Now THAT would definitely be worth all the tradeskilling effort, I think.  I am not so sure if a single target POTG at 500 mana is, though.  The Sickle, for example, is not trivial at 250 smithing. But I will wait to see how it works in practice...:)</div></div><hr />

Lotus has told us point blank PotC was coming in a &quot;novel&quot; approach.<br />

There are 9 maybe more &quot;novels&quot; involved in this quest and it is very creative and something I think Lotus would be giddy and excited about :) <br />

Lotus has never in my recollection either lied to us or misdirected us in anyway. Withhold info? Sure maybe, but lie or mislead never.<br />

<br />
demi-sec champagne &gt; 200 in brewing.<br />
Mistletoe cutting sickle &gt; 250 in smithing failed 4 trys at 181 skill at a cost of around 1000 pp. (didnt know       trivial at the time)<br />
Golden idol of Tunare &gt; 190 in pottery<br />
blessed fishing rod (no confermed triv) for fishing<br />
Gem studded chain &gt; 250 in Jewlery<br />
Ceremonial Solstice Robe (no confermed triv) in tailoring<br />
Misty Thicket Picnic (no confermed triv) for baking<br />
Lucky Cabbage (156&gt;=18:cool:  for baking<br />
<br />
those are mostly the final combines, many other could posable 200+ triv. Is this worth it..........<br />
<br />
Edit: The Hilt is trivial at (181), not the pommel. Lucky cabage was trivial at (18:cool:  Woot!<br />

Made all 3 pieces at 180 without any failures, but the final combine didn't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Locating the brownie parts for the cake is not fun. Them buggers are tuff. I've made all the pieces for the picnic basket with the exception of the cake. <br />

I did get a successful combine on the lucky cabbage with 120 baking.</div></div><hr />

I've failed I think 7 times at 191 tailoring on the robe so it's somewhere in the 210-220 ballpark. I'm just happy the necklace is returned on the failure, almost tanked my bank account trying to get it made by a 250 JC guildmate.<br />
<br />
EDIT: There is a message on eqtraders by someone that a 250 tailor did succeed and did not see a trivial message :(  well the least I can hope for then is skilling up while trying to make this /snicker<br />
<br />
Sheesh for a trade skilling druid, this quest plus working on the 8th shawl is gonna make me crazy ;)  <br />
