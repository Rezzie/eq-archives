<br />
I have reached level 40 and find that I am still wearing my Blackened Defias Armour as there is nothing else to date that has dropped or appears on the AH for me to try out, all the greens appear to be worse then this.<br />
<br />
Obviously a Wolffear Harness is not going to appear unless I am extremely lucky.<br />
<br />
So, being currently feral specced what armour should I now be looking to try and get?<br />
<br />
It is my long term intention to respec to resto/feral rather than complete feral.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
:clap:</div></div><hr />

Search your AH for your GWA, if its not being sold anymore spam around in the trade channel until you find someone who can make it.<br />

Come back when you are 50.</div></div><hr />

30mins of grinding with my alt and I had enough mats for two of them, luckily in my alts guild there is a leatherworker who has agreed to make me one, so I have sent him mats for two and he can AH the other one for his troubles.<br />
<br />
Many thanks indeed and looking forward to receiving my new top.</div></div><hr />

Last night at level 40 I actually killed a level 40 elite ogre all by myself - 980 XP!<br />
<br />
Damn it was good - my little old warrior could not do that at level 44.</div></div><hr />

I took on Arcanist Doan when he was only two levels below me (He was 36, I was 38) to get my bloody Illusionary Rod. True, some will still kill us with ease... like those damned Devilsaurs... Why do we get sent on a suicide quest?!</div></div><hr />

Are you talking about the lv 50 druid quest?  The one to stab a Devilsaur?  Cause if so, you can hibernate it, then go up and stab it, then cheeta away.</div></div><hr />

... I... I...<br />
Well, I fail as a druid... that -never- occured to me. See, I have a druid friend I talk to on WoW and all. He's one level ahead, but we mostly do the same quests at the same time (not always together, though). And he said that he just went up, stabbed it, and was slaughtered. So I just convicted myself to that without thinking about it, hoping that I -might- be able to run away... lasted 3 seconds, ow.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I did complete it. I just never thought of that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Admittedly at 52 I often had to chug a mana pot, but it was worth the fun)</div></div><hr />

Don't you think it would killed by someone else along the way?  How would you get it up the lift?</div></div><hr />
