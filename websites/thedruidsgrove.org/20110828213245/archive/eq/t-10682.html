I most likely will not be raiding for a few months. Pretty sure I have somewhere around 30k to spend. Here is my magelo. <br />

With the exception of my legs, pretty much everything is 1 groupable (or less) or buyable....prices depends on server I guess...<br />
<br />
Not amazing gear by any means..but some upgrades there for you.<br />
<br />
Also the OOW quest armour is nice if you have that expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres rare drops off of oow mobs that all very nice, 120-160 hp / mana.  RCoD - Earring, MPG - Range and ring, Rifts - mask and earring, and WoS - necklace.  Going out to &quot;farm&quot; these items would be highly uneffcient, but if ya xp there enough you can expect to snag one someday.  Theres also some nice one groupable no drop armor thats semi rare (~1 / 4 odds imo) drops from namers.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
Can check what drops from the different OOW zone there.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Outside of that, LDoN would prolly be nice for you.  Can get FT , hp , mana augs and charm stats.<br />
 <br />
The &quot;elite&quot; of one groupable armor is from proving grounds trials.  This stuff is an average of 200 / 200 hp mana.  To get it will you will need a group of generally want a group of qvic+ geared peeps.  From my experiance, as long as you have a high dps rogue, the group makeup can be varied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RS zonetrash drops that we can use are Veil of Frozen Flame and Icedrop Pearl<br />
MPG - Spellsheen Prism and Ring of the Maze Runner<br />
RCoD - Earring of ethical Uncertainty and Tome of Forceful Projection.<br />
WoS - Veil of the Windstrider and Shroud of the Nimble<br />
<br />
There's also a couple somewhat decent augments that drop in Dranik's Scars off of zone trash, Eye of the Dragorn (5 sv all in any aug slot), and Gem of the Chosen ones (15 hp/mana/end in any type 7/8 slot)  There's random zone trash drops in Bloodfields, Noble's causeway and Harbinger's spire as well, but they suck too much for me to remember what they are (iirc NC has a caster belt, and both BF and HS has a leather or priest bracer (wtf?))</div></div><hr />
