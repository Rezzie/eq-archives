I know I don't hang around here much (though you may see a little more of me for a bit, I'm boning up on my Feral Fu) but since you were kind enough to permit me to post a recruitment thread last year I hope you don't mind if I toss up a new one now. <br />
<br />
The tl;dr is this: Axiom (Horde) needs a Feral Druid (for DPS and Tanking) and a Balance Druid for 25-man progression raiding! Our raid times are 6pm-10pm (CST) on Wed, Thu &amp; Mon. (Though two days are shortened right now due to lack of content to fill them.) <br />
<br />
Our official recruitment thread can be found here (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=15234885444&amp;sid=1) but the current text (which includes instructions for applying) is copied below for your convenience.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.<br />
<br />
Ciao,<br />
Ziada (Qiani of &lt;Axiom&gt; on Scarlet Crusade)<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Horde guild Axiom of Scarlet Crusade (CST) is recruiting! We are seeking dedicated players to join us for WotLK raiding.<br />
<br />
About us: Axiom is a progression-focused PvE guild. We cleared Heroic Naxxramas, Heroic Obsidian Sanctum and Heroic Eye of Eternity in our first week of WotLK raiding. We've recently completed Heroic OS with all three drakes up and are now farming current raid content in anticipation of Ulduar. (We're also working on those tasty Heroic raid achievements.)<br />
<br />
We’re a weird bunch of guys and gals with a decidedly odd sense of humor. We get a kick out of dirty jokes and stupid one-liners, but when it's time to down a boss we are as focused as they come. We are not a PG guild -- we do swear on Vent and in chat. If you’re looking for a good home with off-beat players who have a pretty serious raiding focus, Axiom is the place for you.<br />
<br />
Recruiting:<br />
<br />
High Priority<br />
<br />
Tank x1: Feral Druid<br />
Caster DPS x1: Balance Druid<br />
<br />
Exceptional applications for all classes/specs will be considered.<br />
<br />
Raid Schedule:<br />
<br />
Heroic Naxx/OS/EoE: Wednesday, Thursday, Monday from 6-10 pm CST<br />
Normal Naxx/OS/EoE: Raid team members can post sign-ups for normal-mode content at any time. We often schedule normal-mode content for our short Heroic raid nights.<br />
<br />
What we are looking for:<br />
<br />
Please note that we're recruiting active raiders, not benchwarmers. Beyond that, here’s what we’re looking for in an applicant:<br />
<br />
Attitude: Axiom has a strong raiding core made up of players who are dedicated to the guild. We are seeking players with the same sense of dedication, players who want to find a home, to raid with us in WotLK. That doesn't we’re all dead serious over here -- we’re goofy as hell. For this reason applicants must have a sense of humor and enjoy all manner of shenanigans and general insanity. Finally, we are focused on raiding and progression, so applicants must have the maturity to know when to buckle down and focus.<br />
<br />
Gear and Experience: Gear and experience do not necessarily equate skill and we are, above all, seeking skilled players. We prefer applicants who have TBC raid experience and have run some WotLK Heroic dungeons. In terms of gear, some level 80 normal/Heroic dungeon gear/quest blues and some crafted gear are preferred. However, we will consider less geared and/or experienced applicants who submit strong applications.<br />
<br />
Availability and Raid Preparation: Applicants must be able to attend at least 75% of our raids per month -- we are not in the market for casual raiders. In addition, we take raid preparation seriously. Applicants must be motivated to gather consumables, gather gold for repairs, research raid strategies and research ways to improve their output. We do review our raiders on a monthly basis, so minimum-effort players need not apply.<br />
<br />
Finally, we are looking for people who have a strong desire to conquer endgame content and have fun doing it!<br />
<br />
Loot System:<br />
<br />
Players generate ranked lists (size of list determined by raid rank) of the items they need in order of priority. At the start of each month players update their lists and meet with their class leads to go over them. These lists are used to create a master list that determines loot distribution for each new month.<br />
<br />
This may sound unusual but it has worked very well for us. Loot distribution is efficient and drama free. Please feel free to contact us if you have specific questions about how this works.<br />
<br />
