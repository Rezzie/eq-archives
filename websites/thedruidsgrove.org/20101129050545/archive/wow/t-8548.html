<br />
That's right, shaman aren't supposed to rape us with that lame ass spell, we're supposed to shift and then continue on our merry way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you can break a mob's daze effect by shifting so why should you expect to break a frost effect.<br />
<br />
And yes I know I'm Tauren and don't have to really worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aitrus</div><div class="date">03-24-2005, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why are we immune to polymorph when in forms?<br />
why can we break hamstring and wing clip by shifting?<br />
<br />
Frost shock is not like a magical seizing energy, its a bolt of ice that hits you and chills you. You are slowed because your body is coated in ice. Shifting should remove that just like it removes hamstring and wing clip. The druids main attribute is superior control over his physical form. Movement is our #1 ability. We're still suceptible to stuns, but snares we are supposed to be able to break fairly easily as a class trait.<br />
<br />
Daze isnt even worth talking about. It is not a part of the game for any logical story-based reason, its just there because without it nobody would ever die and there would be 0 risk to charging through mobs too hard for you. The devs have basically said that while in theory yes druids should break daze by shifting, there is no way we are going to get that because daze is there purely as a balance issue for pve.</div></div><hr />

The fact that frostshock is an 8 second snare with a 5/6 second cooldown is another matter (*cough, BS).</div></div><hr />

<br />
  I play a shaman as well as a Druid and I will admit it is a kind of get out of jail free card.  its almost always ready when I need it, costs litle mana and is invaluable in both PVE and PVP(against rogues/warriors, not so much against casters or hunters).  I do hope it gets fixed a druid shouldnt have to be perma snared by 1 class.</div></div><hr />
