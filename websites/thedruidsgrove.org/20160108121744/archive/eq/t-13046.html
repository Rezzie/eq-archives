<br />
Returned to EQ recently (albeit to focus on playing a mage this time around) and while updating myself on all the patch messages I noticed they finally added in a new drop to fix the Jaggedpine tunic quest. I immediately logged on my druid and proceeded to clear the river in Jaggedpine Forest. After clearing the rive of potameids and then some I finally got the drop I was after - whisps of potameid hair. I went through the other combines and hand ins and hey presto, Tunic of the Pine. Stats are nothing to write home about obviously but I would rate this quest actually somewhat easier to complete that some of the other pieces like the pants or bracers. Don't think there's an official link in any database yet except Sony's new eqplayers site. I'll submit it to Allakhazam.</div></div><hr />

Last Fall, Sony started a thread about broken quests and I wrote up the bug that prevented anyone from finishing the Tunic. They made the fix, god bless 'em. I guess I should finally update that EQTraders writeup. :)</div></div><hr />

I spent many, many hours in Jaggedpine levelling, questing etc. I became intimately familiar with the gnolls, poachers andpotameids. Never did meet up with Lady Fianya though.<br />
