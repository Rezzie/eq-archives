His quest is he wants to set up shop where he’s sitting but is afraid Williamenia might take his spot so he wants you to go get supplies for him. After a conversation he gives you a six slot box to fill with his supplies and sends you on your way. You travel to FV, Qeynos, Thurgadin, Shadweaver, Freeport, and Bazaar to buy the supplies (cost around 6 plat a piece, wear CHA gear and price will go down a plat) and supplies are no drop. Combine in a box and bring it back to Trep. He gives you 65 plat as a reward and I got at level 61 2% alternate experience for about 20 minutes work.  Check Alakazam for in depth quest details.<br />

Somehow I doubt the devs would let that slip through though.<br />

Unless you don't have much time to play, then I could see how this would be a viable way to get aaxp and money.</div></div><hr />

Although, it would be interesting to see how much XP a lower level player would get.  THAT might be interesting!<br />

They are talking about ways to optimize the quest - like do the combine while at the last merchant, then pick up his item again for the next go round, etc.<br />
<br />
Not sure it would be a good xp farming quest.<br />
<br />
However, I wonder what the lowest level you can do this quest is?  2% AAXP would be a ton of xp for a level 20 :)</div></div><hr />

Meaning, you use your Druid to port and buy another set of items, thus doubling the xp rate.  Just a thought.<br />

I've also heard that if you do this grouped, everyone in the group shares the experience.  Wonder if you could do that with someone who was 35, grouped with a lower level, and get the lower level player some xp?</div></div><hr />

If your lower he tells you to go kill beetles or some stupid remark. It was funny to hear when a lvl 30 druid tried to start this quest, then asked me if there was a level cap.<br />

I think I was averaging around 11 minutes with my enchanter. (but I think the way is shorter to get stuff for the darks possibly).     It's a lot of exp for a 35 :-)   I think i used it to ding 39 when I didn't feel like grouping, only had an hour and a 1/2 before I had to go somewhere, etc.. :-)  I think I made 600p :-)  That was and IS a lot for me! :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree....everytime we post something that we find in the game that is even remotely helpful, it is nerfed.  Granted, this exp was &quot;safe&quot;, but it wan't by any means overpowering.  It still took a good deal of time to do.  A lot less exp than what I could get hunting with my friends, but at least it was something to do to pass the time now and then.<br />
<br />
And you know what?  I knew it was coming.  I check it after every patch.  Why???   Because we (the players) posted it here (Class msg board).  And we liked it.  <br />
<br />
SOE: Sorry, you are not allowed to enjoy the game in any way other than what is prescribed.  Nerf.<br />
<br />
By sharing what we find fun, we may simply be scr*wing ourselves in the end.  It's just sad.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what it is about this game that they are so scared of people advancing through quests.

WTG Social interaction Verant ! /kudos<br />
<br />
I just looked at the title.. 2% AAXP in 5? no. 10? no. 30. 3-0 minutes. How was this needing a nerf? Answer: it wasn't.<br />
<br />
I say we should have. . for lack of a more inspired title. . a Fight Club messageboard (you don't talk about fight club :p  ) and find some way to either keep The Nerf Happy from reading it, or get some sort of admittance program in place... don't ask me how to make sure people wouldn't just go running to Verant. &quot;Mommy, mommy!&quot;<br />
<br />
I find it ridiculous that we can't even post strategies, quests that actually are WORTH something, or anything else for the dreaded FEAR of the nerf bat. . ./sigh<br />
<br />
Someone please stop the nerf insanity!</div></div><hr />
