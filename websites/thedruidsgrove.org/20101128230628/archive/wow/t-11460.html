Didn't know much about the game at that point but much prefer the caster classes now.<br />
<br />
So here is my question. Where and when do Druid's get idols? is this something I have to wait for the higher levels or are there lower level idols out there?<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

<br />
There is the Idol of Ferocity (Now increases damage done by Claw and Rake by 20). It's dropped off of Lord Roccor and used to be one of the only Idols for a while. It is easily farmable @ level 60.<br />
<br />
There's also Idol of Brutality (Now increases Maul and Swipe dmg by 50). Magistrate Barthilas in Stratholme (I believe this guys on UD side). wowwiki also says its a random BoP world drop.<br />
<br />
There is also Idol of the Moon. This increases dmg done by Moonfire up to 33. It's a random world drop I believe and is definitely BoE. Costs range from about 30-60g (on my server anyways)<br />
<br />
The only blue healing related idol. Idol of Rejuvination increases healing done by rejuv by up to 50. Its dropped by Mor Grayhoof in LBRS. <br />
<br />
There is also Idol of Health. This increases Healing done by Healing Touch by 100 (think it used to decrease casttime by 0.35seconds...=?) This is a drop from Viscidus in AQ40.<br />
<br />
Finally. There is Idol of Longetivity. This one drops off of Razuvious in Naxx. You gain 25 mana each time you cast Healing Touch. Not too bad.<br />
<br />

The mana gain scales with your HT rank. So if you cast a rank 4 HT, you only get back like around 5mana per cast.</div></div><hr />
