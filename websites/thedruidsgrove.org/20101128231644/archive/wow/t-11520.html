I'm looking forward to the various applications of cyclone once I reach 70 (aside from fleeing from a fight) and wondered if anyone could answer this question.<br />
Does cyclone remove dots from the target?  <br />
Example, a warlock dots up a target and I drop a moonfire then cyclone.  The 6 seconds the target is in the cyclone, does he/she take damage from the dots?  Do the dots break the cyclone?  Does the cyclone remove the dots?<br />
<br />
Nowah</div></div><hr />

I am at work and can't investigate the answer.  While we wait for the answer, can you paste the cyclone description here?  What level do we get it?  Maim, Lifebloom, Cyclone...  :sumo: <br />

<br />
Cyclone <br />
8% of Base Mana 30 yd range <br />
1.5 sec cast <br />
Tosses the enemy target into the air, preventing all action but making them invulnerable for up to 6 sec. Only one target can be affected by your Cyclone at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhroam</div><div class="date">02-01-2007, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suspect it'll be like a short banish.  You can dot a target up, but when the dots tick, the target will take no damage.... they're invulnerable.<br />
<br />
I look at cyclone as our new favorite form of crowd control.  It's unfortunately expensive at 8% of your total mana.  At most you can CC them 12 times not counting mana regen.  That's 72 seconds.<br />
<br />
It can be used anywhere on any type of creature though... VERY useful.  As long as your raid doesn't mind you drinking after every fight =]<br />
<br />
I'm 2 bars from 69... I'll tell you in a couple of days =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has dimishing returns as well, second cast is only 3 sec long and 3rd cast the target is immune.<br />
<br />
I use it mainly for a stun, or to give me a 6 second head start on a 3 mob pull when soloing.</div></div><hr />

I was relatively unimpressed with that being our level 70 spell when I first heard about it... I at least came up with a use for it..<br />
<br />
It's usable once basically... 3s stun for 1.5s cast just isn't worthwhile.<br />
<br />
I guess I shouldn't be too upset... we did get the uber-coolness of all spells 2 levels before... flight form =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was totally disappointed :(<br />
<br />
I got it, quickly ran out to play with it, quickly took it off  my bar.  I guess it's better than roots not working indoors....I guess.....maybe.  Nah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">02-02-2007, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And before expansion many people predicted this to be one of the most overpowered new spells. =(<br />
<br />
I still don't understand why roots doesn't work indoors...I mean, wouldn't it make more sense in places like RFK?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiercy</div><div class="date">02-04-2007, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyone know the cooldown on it? :elfbiggri</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcapodiferro</div><div class="date">02-04-2007, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Diminished returns!!!  That's depressing.  I would like to see it either changed to no diminished returns or instant cast.  I don't believe there is a cool down, correct me if I'm wrong.  The only real value I see in my future is to remove a healer from pvp battle for 6 seconds.  After that, I would be primary target and wouldn't be able to get another shot off anyway.  I'm very excited about the druid class right now so I don't want to start whining...but it is still a very weak level 70 spell.  Who knows, maybe with a little practice, we might find it effective.  <br />
Here's another question regarding cyclone.  Can it be trinketed out of? or dispelled?  I imagine that is the case which makes it that much harder to accept as a decent level 70 spell.<br />
<br />
Peace be with Druids.</div></div><hr />

I remember reading a thread on the official forum boards about uses for Cyclone. I'll dig it up and repost it.</div></div><hr />

I've never casted a 4th time on the same mob yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">02-06-2007, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bug with cyclone as well??<br />
<br />
Tested on a paladin in a duel... It removes his aura! :)<br />
<br />
Anyone noticed anything? It didnt remove his buff in that matter, but his aura was gone after the cyclone was done..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blueboy</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kind of like cyclone even though it effect is for a short duration. I find it enough time to squeeze in a HT on myself or to give me a head start to run away. <br />
If I had to fix it a bit, how about cyclone &quot;wipe&quot; aggro from us or from other target, say a healer? Maybe have different effect depending on your talent build? Maybe longer duration in Balance and for healer wipe aggro? Wishful thinking guys.. About love our druids for what they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">one thing i noticed... cyclone is awesome for arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">02-23-2007, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea...I see cyclone being nerfed or changed somehow, even with the dimishing returns, it's brutal in the Arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">02-26-2007, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sucks? Lol.. not really. It interuppts spellcasting. Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jcapodiferro</div><div class="date">02-26-2007, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, lets break it down a bit.<br />
<br />
PVP.  Yes cyclone is very effective.  Any druid not utilizing it is gimping him/herself.  I see some people commenting (specially in the wow druid-slam forums) that cyclone needs to be nerfed.  I say no.<br />
Seriously, in PVE what do you use it for besides squeezing off a heal and/or running away.  Is that really effective cc?  In a 5 man instance with 4 mobs on your group, a 6sec cc is very very small.  Any nerf would destroy what little use it has in pve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">02-26-2007, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If its changed it would be only a pvp side of it, I would hope.<br />
<br />
Like you said its pretty much pointless in PvE, didnt even have it on a action bar till I started pvping again in the Arena.<br />
<br />
In the arena, it's insane though...I can almost see it being changed to a caster &quot;stun&quot;, no duration but just used to stun spell casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">02-27-2007, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, it's a PvP skill. What's the problem? Fighting real people instead of a made up programs should be encouraged as it requires more skill, anyway. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-27-2007, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agreed with goa<br />
<br />
edit:  Maybe if anything to make it PvE viable, they put a talent far down in the Balance tree to extend the duration of the stun for say 6 seconds for 3 talent points.  This would put it at a 12 second stun, on par with sheep, seduce, etc for PvP and useful in PvE as well.  Giving every druid a longer cyclone seems OP, especially for ferals who can already effectivley solo multiple mobs, but it seems like something that a Balance druid should / could get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">03-07-2007, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cyclone is the best PvP CC there is; the current metagame of War/Pal combinations make this especially true since the other forms of CC can be cleansed. <br />
<br />
In my experience, DoTs still tick and do damage under a Cyclone, but I imagine this is a bug.</div></div><hr />

I definitely need to test this!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">04-03-2007, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well dont do any PvP here but not sure about anyone else but cyclone seems to put a good deal of threat on the target as ny time I even attempt to use it on a run away mob it bee lines to me as soon as its though.  Though on a side note I find it quite useful for stopping runners (aka: feared) in thier tracks so that our tank can run to them and get ready for taunt as soon as the mob is freed up.</div></div><hr />
