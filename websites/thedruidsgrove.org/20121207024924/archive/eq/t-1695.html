I found it on USENET, but am unable to determine it's origin.<br />

O proud left foot, that ventures quick within<br />
Then soon upon a backward journey lithe.<br />
Anon, once more the gesture, then begin:<br />
Command sinistral pedestal to writhe.<br />
<br />
Commence thou then the fervid Hokey-Poke,<br />
A mad gyration, hips in wanton swirl.<br />
To spin! A wilde release from Heavens yoke.<br />
Blessed dervish! Surely canst go, girl.<br />
<br />
The Hoke, the poke -- banish now thy doubt<br />
Verily, I say, 'tis what it's all about.<br />

There's a radio station near hear that does dramatic readings by Sean Connery.  For some reason I can hear his voice reading this :) <br />
<br />
Oh, and as for the &quot;dramatic&quot; readings... they're not that dramatic.  Funniest one was him reading &quot;Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay&quot; in Sean Connery Scottish:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm schittin' in the mornin' sun,<br />
I'll be schittin' when the evenin's done,<br />
Watchin' the ships roooollll in,<br />
Just to watch them rooolllll away again...<br />
I'm just schittin'!&quot;<br />
<br />
You have to hear it to get the full effect :)</div></div><hr />
