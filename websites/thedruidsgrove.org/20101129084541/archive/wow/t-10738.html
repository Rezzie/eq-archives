Flora means plants, so any plants that you can kill, like Blood petals in Ungoro (where I did it), those walking trees in Felwood etc:wiggle:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">06-23-2006, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest has nothing to do with Tier 3 aside from name.  The quest is for the reward tokens.  Get enough tokens and you turn them in to the quartermaster at Light's Hope and you can choose from various rewards.  There are both blue and purple loot.  You may do the quests repeatedly to get multiple rewards.  The higher your rep with AD the less tokens you will need to get the rewards.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">06-24-2006, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I farmed them fronds in Felwood.. at the toxic pool with the water and tree -elementals. The trees drop fronds and the water guys drop core of element (some other thing you can turn in for the same effect).<br />
<br />
And that place is also swamped with whipper root tubers and night dragons so you can quickly pick up a couple of them when you're already in the neighbourhood. :)<br />
<br />
Bad news is tho, that it was pretty heavy farmed by others yesterday at our server.. seems they maybe thinking in same direction as me. And killing off every horde (or alliance) you see can be tricky as the GY is like a 5 sec walk away.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">06-26-2006, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fronds will drop without the quest in your log; however, the drop rate may be significantly higher with the quest. I do not, as yet, have enough samples to determine if the differences in drop rate were due to the streaky WoW RNG or due to having the quest in my log.</div></div><hr />

You've got tons of obnoxious plants all to your self. Usually in groups of 3 or 4, though, which might complicate things.</div></div><hr />
