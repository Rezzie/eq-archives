<br />
Its a good guide but not entirely accurate.  I'm working on the key now and its all fresh in my mind, so heres a few amendments you should note regarding shard droppers:<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove:  Shik'nar Warrior &amp; Shik'nar Royal Guard<br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins:  Rygan Anisher, A Shadow Reaver (triggered spawn from traps, but you have a chance of getting mind worms or trap dispell instead), Shaded Stones, A Rubble Rouser (might wanna stear clear of the rubble rousers tho, they have about a gazillion hp's)<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye: A Goranga Seer has Goranga Scout ph's (rather than a straight 3 hour respawn as stated in the walkthru.  Run straight accross zone from dsp zoneline till you see the ruins, on the nearest corner is a stone with 3 static scouts on a 25 min respawn.  I beleive there are several other places to camp for a shard in ME, but thats the one I stuck to - altho there are wanderers you can sit out of the way of the regular trains.)<br />
<br />
Acryllia Caverns:  After spending a total of about 4 hours killing every skullcracker I could find I double checked with my guild and discovered that theres only 1 skullcracker that actually drops the shard.  Thats the lightblue (to 65) one whereas the others are all green.  From Grimling zoneline, turn right, then left and you'll see an iron gate with 2 static spawns which can either be a skullcracker or a Smudged Grimling (both lightblue).  Set up camp just the other side of the gate as theres no roamers.  The smudged grimlings are very very MR so you might wanna take a tank type with you.<br />
<br />
You also need to do &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1999&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; quest to get to the emp room.<br />
<br />
You should also note that the rift from Emp Ssra is no longer summoned from the staff he drops, and so is no longer tradable.  It now drops from mobs that spawn after his death (apparantly, I havnt finished emp key yet so cant confirm :) )<br />
<br />
The quest is long and fairly tedious (I'm starting to see shards and snakes in my sleep) and you will hate Ssra long before you've finished either key, but I wish you very good luck :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks &gt; Hoppers + Sambata - both soloable or duoable no prob for your char. Not rare<br />
<br />
Grey &gt; The skells around the Lake to the north, soloable or duoable for you no prob. Not rare<br />
<br />
Seru &gt; Uper Ring .. Hand of seru good choice, but most of the mobs there can drop them, you can solo (or duo) these, some are pretty tough (some named ones unsnarable - rootable) and be careful of roamers. Not very rare but not common.<br />
<br />
Deep - Thought Horrors before and after bridge, you definetly need a group -some form of crowd control or a very good shaman for this shard. Frequency is much better past the invisible bridge. Would consider it a rare drop.<br />
<br />
Akheva - the stone creatures near the Va-Dyn area - would have a solid group for this, pretty common drops though.<br />
<br />
Ssra Temple . Mines skells - can drop off any skell, they have a large agro/add range, would get a solid group with good CC capabilities. Not very common drop.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye . Named Gorangas. your best bet is the stone with the 3 spawns near the Dawnshroud Zoneline. Harmo pull them and kill one by one either solo or duo. This shard can be a nightmare, most of the named one will drop shard though. (the named ones that spawn on the hill or around a stone I think near the hill tro the left (basically the lower level gorangas) wont drop shard.<br />
<br />
Acrylia - Only the 2 high level skullcrackers (if i remember correctly) which spawn at the gate near the entrance of the zone, can drop the shards, the respawn time is 20 mins, you may have trouble breaking the spawn, 1 shouldnt be a problem for you but 2 may take some effort, they are rootable though. Can be a fairly long camp.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Dessert - very easy - the reavers - revenants up on the plateu shouldnt give you much trouble. Quite common too.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - You need the royals (bugs) inside the cave deep in fungus. I dont think its possible for you to duo/solo these, they are quite tough, and the drop rate is quite rare, better have a solid group willing to stay there for a few hours.<br />

Maidens Eye - The goranga prophet that pops by AR will drop the shard as well, easy with charm action.</div></div><hr />

FG, AR, Grey, Seru, DSP, SD, ME is doable solo.<br />
Acrylia I havent tried to solo but Ive heard they are 100%MR<br />
The deep is another place I havent tried to solo but It might be doable.<br />
Ssra, the mobs summon so not soloable by a druid.</div></div><hr />

Longest camp so far has been the FG one. Took hours to get the 3 shards me and my other guildies were looking for. I haven't tried the ME one yet but will try it soon, but I also heard it is a biatch and the named doesn't always drop it.<br />
The Deep and Ssra are group hunts imo. I've done the Ssra camp on one occasion but after everyone got their shard (except me) we got a gater which brought a train and we had to evac and then group broke up - how convenient, grrrr.</div></div><hr />

Set up on the zone wall just west of the zone to akheva.  Charm a ravenous beast and give it a couple magic weapons.<br />
Pull the pair of gorangas in front of the akheva zone (goranga battlemaster can spawn there), the three gorangas just to the east of that (goranga prophet can spawn there), and if you have time, the three gorangas to the northwest (some other named goranga spawns there).  Pull a few mobs at once and root park them, to save time.<br />
Keep all three camps cleared and your shard camp time should be 1/3 of what it normally would be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grey - Soloable EZ<br />
<br />
Seru - Soloable EZ. Watch out for the barbarian dude, he summons :) <br />
<br />
Deep - Can be done with you and a melee if you're VERY good. Add a third that can slow and you're golden. Kill horrors before invis bridge, one will drop eventually.<br />
<br />
Akheva - Can be soloed if you know the right spot and are good.<br />
<br />
Ssra Temple - This camp sucks. Minimum of 3 to do decently. Crowd control, melee, and a healer. Best to do with a guild that is doing AE kills though.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye - Soloable, EZ. A few of the named like to heal and gate when low on HP though, make sure you kill them close to their spawn points.<br />
<br />
Acrylia - Soloable, but challenging due to small area to work in. Breaking will test your skills. With a melee its cake, root one, tank other, kill other, rinse repeat.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Dessert - simple but can take some time, reavers/revenants up on the plateu <br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - Soloable if you know the right spot. This will again stretch your skills and courage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bippwinno</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the Akheva camp, use invis to the room outside Va dyn.<br />
Camp in one of the corners(there is a mob in each corner who is static spawn but he is easy to kill).<br />
Pull a few mobs and root them in the corner with some space between them(Usually I root 3 but up to 5 is doable, but hard). Snare everyone. Dot everyone with manaless dots and one with your manadots. Try to rotate the root so everyone is rooted with 30 secs difference, this is cruical since they wont lose root at same time.<br />
<br />
Time the roots so, hopefully, a root will never let lose. Better to root to often then to few times. when the mob which you used manadots on dies continu on next. Remember always to keep your manaless dots on all the rooted mobs. If you use manadots on every rooted mob you will lose mana to fast. When doing this I rarely go below 70m(I got ok manaregen by default FT14+boon of recovery+spells so on a good day I dont even get below 90m). <br />
<br />
If something goes wrong evac or run to zone, better to escape and try again then to die and lose valuable time.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the FG camp, invis into the room where you have a few warriors and a priest. do close rooting(stand as close you can not to get aggro from others and cast a root) he may hit you some but if you cant take that you shouldnt try this alone.<br />
Use 61 root, the other wont keep them rooted long enough.<br />
Snare it and start to dot.<br />
Always keep it rooted, dont run around if he gets lose and starts hitting you, you will aggro the rest, just let him hit you and root him again. If you want you can use the tunnels but they have got roamers.<br />
<br />
Kill them of, and just wait for a repop and start again.<br />
Everyone should be killed where they spawn to prevent unnecessary aggro. if priest CH, has only happened on one of the mobs, move it some and the priest will stop.<br />
<br />
If you want extra action, try the royal guards, they use LoH so keep stun up. also they cant be pulled solo you have to keep both rooted. Pull these intio the tunnel to the royal area. <br />
<br />
Pull by rooting one at their spawn point, keep him rooted there while killing the other in the other end of the tunnel to prevent him from helping his friend. This will cost a lot of mana since the only root workin on the shiknars is the 61 version, the other just drops to fast. Also you need to stun the royal guards and that drans manapool fast.<br />
<br />
If something goes wrong evac or run to zone, better to escape and try again then to die and lose valuable time.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help some</div></div><hr />
