The World of Warcraft is ripe for eager young Christian evangelists to ply their trade. &quot;I'm studying to be a missionary at Liberty University (http://www.liberty.edu/), in Lynchburg, Virginia,&quot; says one gamer (who prefers to remain anonymous) and sharing the Good News of Jesus in Azeroth is a great way to practice soulwinning in Arkansas, where I'm from originally.  I think that when Jesus said in Mark 16:15, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, He knew that True Christians™ like me in the future, would be called into virtual worlds where we'd be witnessing to gnomes, trolls, night elves and all sorts of other creatures.  I also think that verse applies to Christian astronaut missionaries in the future who will encounter and evangelize unsaved alien life forms on other planets. I believe with my whole heart that Christian gamers are sincerely answering the Great Commission of Jesus and we are able to do it without getting out of our chairs or leaving our bedrooms. I bet the Apostle Paul is so jealous!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Unless you're talking about Libery University which I'm sure is either a false quote or taken out of context.<br />
<br />
I take this as a satire site, just like The Onion. I'm not religious in any way and I find their artical humerous.</div></div><hr />

It's a hoax site like The Onion.  They once did a similar article about Everquest.  It was hilarious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note - I feel bad that Christianity is basically become a joke in the minds of most people.  But I can understand the criticism because of the things that Christians have said and done to others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whatever people want to do is fine with me, people with like interests should play together, but I think anyone spamming rhetoric in general chat would probably cause trouble.</div></div><hr />
