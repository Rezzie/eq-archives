<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stronghoof</div><div class="date">09-08-2006, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always been intrigued by the Druid class in WoW.  I started one some time ago and took my time playing him and grew to love the class.  One of my favorite things to do in games in PvP, so I took the big guy to the WSG BG.  Now I realize this is only level 19 and perhaps this is part of my problem.  But boy I just got stomped.  I found myself only able to run around root people and pop off heals where I could but with both having such slow casting times I was toast fairly quickly a lot of the time.<br />
<br />
I check my server rankings and sure enough there are 2 level 60 druids in the top 5 for HK's.<br />
<br />
So here is the question part.  Am I missing something? Am I just too low level?  Is there a secret ingredient for druids in PvP? Balance? Feral? Resto?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any helpful responses even if they say go read so and so's post.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />

Chances are you were dealing with some serious twinks in the lvl 19 bracket.  At lvl 19 all you have is Bear &gt;.&lt; and unless you have some nice twink gear you're going to get stomped on.....a lot.<br />
<br />
I pvp'd heavily for a while and hit rank 12.  I was NEVER that high for HKs b/c I was busy running the flag, or stealth capping a node in AV or AB.  <br />
<br />
Since that time I have re-geared and re-spec'd to resto.  Now I play full time heal support ( and healing a fury warrior that just mows through people lends to a ton of HKs ).  In PUGs, if you heal you'll be loved and protected.  In performed groups you'll have decided roles ahead of time.  <br />
<br />
PvP for druids becomes much more viable in the 30 - 39 backet since we get our travel form and can outrun everyon =D.  Before that it is really rough.<br />
<br />
In the end though, HKs mean nothing.  It's the wins and how you play as a team that will get people respecting your abilities.  A good team player is 100x better than an amazing go it aloner.</div></div><hr />

I did WSG at level 15 once...and never set foot into a BG until level 49 (which I stayed for about 2-3weeks) doing mainly AB.</div></div><hr />
