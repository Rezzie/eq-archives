<br />
He said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was due to gas falling to $10 a barrel, but later he said he was corrected by a Soviet economist.  It was because before that gas had been $80 a barrel and the Soviets overextended themselves and they couldn't maintain that on $10 a barrel gas.  He says Iran is in the same position today, as are many regimes of gas-rich countries we don't much care for.<br />

Interesting interview.<br />

Good stuff!  I was in my teens and twenties when that all took place but I wasn't aware (was anyone?) that falling oil prices was the exact cause!  As I recall, everyone thought it was a combination of bad crop years and a ression, not deflation of oil pricess spurred on by Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi's brought down the Soviet Union!!!</div></div><hr />

&gt; GOOGLE  it or follow this link.  It will blow your mind.  <br />
&gt; _http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1911_ (http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1911_) <br />
&gt; (http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1911 (http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1911)) <br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; The  U.S. Geological Service issued a report in April<br />
&gt; ('08) that only <br />
&gt; scientists and  oilmen knew was coming, but man was it big.<br />
&gt; It was a revised report <br />
&gt; (hadn't been  updated since '95) on how much oil<br />
&gt; was in this area of the <br />
&gt; western 2/3 of North  Dakota; western South Dakota; and<br />
&gt; extreme eastern Montana ... <br />
&gt; check THIS  out:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; The Bakken is the largest domestic oil discovery since<br />
&gt; Alaska's  Prudhoe Bay, <br />
&gt; and has the potential to eliminate all American dependence<br />
&gt; on  foreign oil. <br />
&gt; The Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates it at<br />
&gt; 503  billion <br />
&gt; barrels. Even if just 10% of the oil is recoverable... at<br />
&gt; $107 a barrel,  we're <br />
&gt; looking at a resource base worth more than $5.3 trillion.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; 'When I  first briefed legislators on this, you could<br />
&gt; practically see their <br />
&gt; jaws hit the  floor. They had no idea.' says Terry<br />
&gt; Johnson, the Montana <br />
&gt; Legislature's  financial analyst.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; 'This sizable find is now the highest-producing <br />
&gt; onshore oil field found in <br />
&gt; the past 56 years,' reports The Pittsburgh Post <br />
&gt; Gazette. It's a formation <br />
&gt; known as the Williston Basin, but is more commonly <br />
&gt; referred to as the 'Bakken.' <br />
&gt; And it stretches from Northern Montana, through  North<br />
&gt; Dakota and into Canada. <br />
&gt; For years, U.S.oil exploration has been considered  a dead<br />
&gt; end. Even the 'Big <br />
&gt; Oil' companies gave up searching for major oil wells <br />
&gt; decades ago. However, a <br />
&gt; recent technological breakthrough ha s opened up the <br />
&gt; Bakken's massive <br />
&gt; reserves... and we now have access of up to 500 billion <br />
&gt; barrels. And because this is <br />
&gt; light, sweet oil, those billions of barrels will  cost<br />
&gt; Americans just $16 PER <br />
&gt; BARREL!<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; That's enough crude to fully fuel the  American economy<br />
&gt; for 41 years straight.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; 2. [And if THAT didn't throw you  on the floor, then<br />
&gt; this next one should - <br />
&gt; because it's from TWO YEARS AGO,  people!]<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; U.S.Oil Discovery- Largest Reserve in the World!<br />
&gt; Stansberry  Report Onli ne - 4/20/2006 Hidden 1,000 feet<br />
&gt; beneath the surface <br />
&gt; of the Rocky  Mountains lies the largest untapped oil<br />
&gt; reserve in the world is <br />
&gt; more than 2  TRILLION barrels. On August 8, 2005 President<br />
&gt; Bush mandated its  <br />
&gt; extraction.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; They reported this stunning news: We have more oil inside<br />
&gt; our  borders, than <br />
&gt; all the other proven reserves on earth. Here are the<br />
&gt; official  estimates:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; -8-times as much oil as Saudi Arabia<br />
&gt; -18-times as much oil  a s Iraq<br />
&gt; -21-times as much oil as Kuwait<br />
&gt; -22-times as much oil as  Iran<br />
&gt; -500-times as much oil as Yemen- and it's all right<br />
&gt; here in the Western  <br />
&gt; United States.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; HOW can this BE? HOW can we NOT BE extracting this!? <br />
&gt; Because the <br />
&gt; democrats,environmentalists and left wing republicans have <br />
&gt; blocked all efforts to help <br />
&gt; America become independent of foreign  oil.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; James Bartis, lead researcher with the study says we've<br />
&gt; got more oil  in this <br />
&gt; very compact area than the entire Middle East -more than 2<br />
&gt; TRILLION  barrels. <br />
&gt; Untapped. That's more than all the proven oil reserves<br />
&gt; of crude oil in  the <br />
&gt; world today, reports The Denver Post.<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; ----<br />
&gt; Don't think 'OPEC' will  drop its price - even<br />
&gt; with this find? Think again! <br />
&gt; It's all about the  competitive marketplace, - it has<br />
&gt; to.<br />
&gt; ----<br />
&gt; [Got your attention/ire up  yet?  Hope  so!  Now,  while<br />
&gt; you're thinking <br />
&gt; about it ... and hopefully P.O'd, do  this:<br />
&gt; <br />
&gt; 3. Forward this to=2 0all your thinking friends. If you<br />
&gt; don't  take a little <br />
&gt; time to do this, then you should stifle yourself the next<br />
&gt; time you  want to <br />
&gt; complain about gas prices .. because by doing NOTHING,<br />
&gt; you've forfeited  your <br />
&gt; right to complain.</div></div><hr />

Well I have attempted to add a link to a very funny Austrailian interview with a politician - however I cannot seem to figure out how to link the file. It is a winamp file. Anyway... sorry :)</div></div><hr />

Was it this interview: Front Fell Off (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcU4t6zRAKg)?  <br />
<br />
Even if it's not, that one is pretty good.  The same guys (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clarke_(satirist)) do some other funny interviews as well.  Search on Clarke and Dawe (http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Clarke+and+Dawe+&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f) on YouTube and you'll find plenty.</div></div><hr />
