<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">01-20-2006, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just looking for a little advice. I have 428 AA's and just finished Shared Cammo. Magelo should be mostly up to date, just before the patch. Which would be more worth it?<br />
 <br />
1. Finishing the DD line<br />
2. Finishing the DoT line<br />
3. Finishing Silent Casting<br />
 <br />
Those 3 I see as being the most beneficial. I group almost 100% because I despise soloing, when and where I can get one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">01-21-2006, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh man, tack on some defensive aa's bro! =D Lightening reflexes and whatnot are awesome. I also think that convergance of spirits is an AMAZING aa. The 2k insta heal+1k/tick really makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">01-21-2006, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I was gonna do defensives after the offenses. I rarely do anything dumb enough to get hit. But, I have the archtype def's maxed, just haven't went beyond.<br />
 <br />
As for convergance, I might look into that. I just hate it's on the same timer as SotG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Welas</div><div class="date">01-21-2006, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you play healer a good bit, I would for sure do Convergence of the Spirits. While it does suck that it is on the same timer as SOTG, I find CoS to be MUCH more useful and a lifesaver.<br />
 <br />
 As far as SC goes, I haven't trained this one yet, but I have heard that its not really worth it if you have better stuff to do first. Its pretty rare that I draw aggro anyway in a group (unless I am chain nuking in a low dps group) and almost never in a raid, so I just don't see the benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">01-21-2006, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silent casting has a cast time, which sucks. And it's a pretty long cast time.. so when you see 5 mobs incoming and need to throw a quick heal, you won't have time to do silent casting.<br />
 <br />
I would take Swift Journey first.<br />
Then Convergence of Spirits.<br />
Then finish DD stuff, then DoT stuff. If it gets boring, do Secondary Forte somewhere between.<br />
After that probably max avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">01-21-2006, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">suggest only avoidance AA's for now... I'm assuming netura included those in when he said &quot;defensive AAs&quot;. The mitigation AAs aren't that hot and should be left for later. But the avoidance and evasion AAs are good to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">01-21-2006, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really, really wish I could play this weekend. Hell, I'd even stoop so low to do what I hate and go solo some XP while LFG. That double XP is calling to me. I'd be soaking up AA's like there's no tomorrow. I might have even been able to catch up a little.<br />
 <br />
But, unfortunately I'm working an extended 32 hour shift. 4pm Friday to Midnight Saturday. Of all the lousy weekends to pull duty. =(<br />
 <br />
Thanks for all of your input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kagonis</div><div class="date">01-25-2006, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silent Casting is good on pulls where you are warned in advance.<br />
<br />
Monk_01 tells the raid, 'Oops, I think I got a few adds.'<br />
Pop SC and you are going 1 minute with barely any agro, and you can spam heal.<br />
<br />
Another scenario is initial healing on a mob that hits you to a pulp before you can blink if you get agro. Just before a boss pull, pop SC and you can spam heal the tank from the get go without worrying (much) about agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">01-25-2006, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, with what I could muster out of the double XP I got about 40 more AA's and put them all into the DD line. I now have 465 AA's with Destructive Fury 2. Since all I did for the XP was kite, the extra crits made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">01-26-2006, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you raid, I would recommend finishing off RC.  I would also recommend CoS, Persistant Casting, and Quickened Curing after RC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">01-26-2006, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does persistent casting work? If so, how good is it? I only got third level of it couple days ago, just before resist AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find PC very useful, esp in DoD missions where the Undead Stun you (if you don't resist).<br />
<br />
I have channeled KR through it even while being stunned 8 of the 10 seconds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think persistant casting is an utter waste of an AA. but thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galain</div><div class="date">02-03-2006, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I think Silent Casting is broken.  I can't tell you how many times I have used it when we had multiple mobs and I heal the MA and somehow get all the adds on me.  This is with the MA AE taunting too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorlab</div><div class="date">02-03-2006, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind AE taunt is a one time deal, if he AE taunts and you pull agro off him after that there's not much a warrior can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">02-03-2006, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your aa...go with lightning reflexes next.  Nothing is quite as nice as seeing the mob swing at you 5 times and miss 4 before the tank gets agro back under control.  It really does give us a lot more survivability, its made a big difference to me since I maxed out avoidance aa.<br />
