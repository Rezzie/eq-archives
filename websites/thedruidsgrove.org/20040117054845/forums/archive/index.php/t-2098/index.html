<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ccLothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Feel free to move this, but I wanted to get something going in general.  <br />
<br />
Background<br />
I spent several hours in ChardokB last night.  I was really excited because I used to hunt many nights in Chardok, one of my all-time favorite dungeons.  Compared to CoD it’s an easy crawl.  Nothing hit for more than 400’s that we saw.  Resists weren’t too bad and there wasn’t a lot of chain agro.  Usually you never pull more than two and prox agro works well for singling mobs.  There is almost always a named on track somewhere --- even if it’s a quest giver.  Remember to con :) .  The zone is a cross between LoY and old Chardok.  The mobs are all based on what you see deep in old Chardok and I’m pretty sure these mobs are KoS to everyone.  The pathways are wide and varation of elevation is classic Chardok.   <br />
<br />
I saw three Quests:<br />
1) Gather four staffs for a reward --- Priest Quest?<br />
2) Gather four pages – Int caster quest?<br />
3) Gather four blades – Melee Quest?<br />
<br />
We picked up in our group one of each type.<br />
<br />
The loot:<br />
Saw several items that drop in old Chardok here off random mobs.  Nothing special these days, but did include some level 60 spells.  There were two really nice items I saw links to.  One was was a pair of FT2, Imp Dam4 boots and a FT2 Neck with a few stats.  I believe both were no drop.  We killed a mob that dropped a high AC melee bracer and another mob dropped a haste mask for melees.  <br />
<br />
Getting there<br />
It’s really not that hard to get to if you know your way around old Charkok.  Take the lev tunnel back to the herbalist room.  Stay left of the room and cross the small stream of water.  Hug the bank on the other side and take it back around to the right.  There will be a lever on the wall that you pull down (click) to zone into ChardokB.  Its not more than a 20 second run from the herbalist shack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stewwy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What were the faction hits both + and -.  I heard that the &quot;live&quot; sarnaks were on Di'zok faction and if you kill them you will lose faction with the royal family.  Of course this makes no sense from a storyline point of view considering these are the betrayers of the royal family.<br />
<br />
But do you remember the faction hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ccLothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the factions I recall seeing are<br />
<br />
Korucust<br />
Di Zok<br />
Royal?<br />
<br />
Depending on if you kill live or dead mobs moved +-Di Zok.  I really didn't pay close attention.  Faction typically means little to me until I don't have it. :)   <br />
<br />
<br />
*edit*  Looks like they tuned Korucust.  No longer one groupable.  Has a nasty AE that DoTs and mana drains.  <br />
<br />
Kinda lame.  Guess the loot was just too good for the ease of the of mob.  But then again, why didn't they put him in there with the AE to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I dug out the rogue for this last night. :)    I always loved Chardok.  I'm not sure what &quot;pocket zone&quot; means.  It wasn't an instance.  Maybe pocket means temporary?  <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Loot?  What is that again?&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
Shame the zone is temporary.  This was a fun zone.  {irony}The real surprise was when you killed some mobs there were sometimes these trinkets on their corpses.  I heard others call it loot, or lewt (regional languange differences I think).  This is a very novel game concept!  Putting loot or lewt onto creatures that a group can kill!  I like this trend, hope SOE continues it.  It was like cracking open a pinata and finding it wasn't empty inside.  Very clever.  {/end irony}<br />
<br />
In general the loot was almost, but not quite, good enough to replace what my main character has from ST, NToV and a few PoP items.   They would have been nice upgrades for any of my legion of bots though.  I did snag the haste mask, though, but I don't see myself using it until I weapon that can clearly replace Ragebringer for me.<br />
<br />
There was loot there others found that would have been upgrades for my group-mates.  I think a few of us did get a slot upgraded.  But anyone heavily into PoP probably would've pooh-poohed the loot.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Faction&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
Going through my log I only see:<br />
<br />
Your faction standing with Betrayers of Di`Zok got better/worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Brood of Di`Zok got better/worse.<br />
Your faction standing with Followers of Korucust got better/worse.<br />
<br />
For the night:<br />

(I think EQWatcher needs a faction watching module... ;)  <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;On Death and Dying&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Well, there's some risk here just getting to the zone.  It's between the herbalist and bank area.  On the Herbalist side of the waterfall.  There's a lever you click and in you go.  Looks like lots of people tried to run down with invis, unfortunately lots of things in Chardok can see through.   <br />
<br />
Once inside, you really just don't want to have a TPW.  Getting a cleric back down to res you won't be a lot of fun unless someone has a better route to get there than I have.  <br />
<br />
I'd call the actual recovery from death:  High Risk<br />
<br />
But I'd rate the actual chance of dying, at level 65:  Low Risk<br />
<br />
We had one fatality, an enchanter.  I was a bit rusty on botting my cleric. :)  <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Experience&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Well, it was just very good!  Things died very quickly.  It seemed like mid-200's hits was the typical high for regular mobs.  Certain mobs hit higher, but nothing like PoP.  Was a nice place for a rusty, botted cleric.  Got about 1% per kill and the kills were fast.  <br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Mobs&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Nothing seemed to run, so unmem snare.<br />
<br />
Poisons seemed to work, although everything seemed immune to the stun component of my poisons.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  *cough* Actually Korocust used to be an easy solo during Luclin.  He was rootable and didn't summon.  With good sarnak faction you just pull him out to the dropdown under the bridge on the other side of the captain room, root him and burn him down.  His faction hit was even trivial.  Only problem was that he was a very rare spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gamilenka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tried to get a few people together to check it out this morning.  Naturally it was a no go! DOH!<br />
<br />
I was amazed when I actually con'd a group in to going to Veksar not long after it opened.  People seem afraid of dungeons, and that sucks.  So many open dungeons now, they are probably the best place to hunt because of it.  You might get better xp per kill in PoP, but there is competition for mobs.  Seems like 0 competition would even out the xp.  I know it has for some zones in luclin for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gamilenka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh and btw.  Alakazam had a few items on their front page from B.  Some of them really are pretty decent that I saw.  Nice all/all neck/waist piece that has regen on it.  Read what you are looking at though if you check it out. They got some pieces from PoTime mixed in too, so don't get excited till you read what zone it was from hehe.</div></div><hr />

I thought I was the only one who mounted my logs directory remotely from a Linux box :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There's a second way: install cygwin.  Most (but not all) of the useful tools are included.  Then you don't have to read the files remotely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SilleyEskimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the zone is great.  You can definately tell it was made by the LoY team.  It has a story, quests, diverse/interesting layout, and LOOT.  Yes, LOOT.  You know, the stuff that is virtually non-existant in PoP?  <br />
<br />
I was surprised at how empty the zone was.  There were maybe 20 people there total.  We explored it from one side to the other in about and hour, stopping to camp various interesting spots along the way.<br />
<br />
There certianly were plenty of corpses at the Chardok zone in of failed attempts to find Chardok B :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just fought the new and improved chadrok b boss couple of nights ago. He was tough!  Nasty AE! Iirc it was 250hp/150 mana per tick. Almost unresistsable. No wall to hide from it either. =( people were dying fast.  We finally got him with a raid of 40 people and left 3 people still standing. <br />
<br />
A guildie almost finished a quest in Chadrok b. The staff one. <br />
A guy inside the castle ask you for 4 staffs. you gave him 4 staffs and he give you back a bag and ask for 4 gems. She has only 3 gems now though. Wil let you know what the reward it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From what i hear when you finish the quest a mob spawns that you kill, loot an item, and hand the item in for the final reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Delowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have completed the Page quest, reward is <br />
<br />
Golem heart ring<br />
10AC,+20str,+15sta,+10wis,+70hp,+50mana<br />
all/all<br />
<br />
When you go to turn the pages in MAKE SURE you have a group with you. After you turn in pages a golem spawns that you must kill and loot his heart and give it to the quest NPC to receive ring. Golems opening hit on me was 1000dmg, he is rootable and snareable, and he is slowable. After I turned in my heart the golem spawned agian (this is a bug) so we got another ring for my group mate . So keep on your toes when you do your heart turn in another golem might spawn. Pages ARE Multi-questable too .<br />
<br />
<br />
I have also completed the quest where you have to return the staff to Baelin Xir`Rixoan. HE DID NOT give a reward for returning his staff, he gave me a bag to collect the gems that went on the staff and I have yet to collect all the gems:(  I currently have 3 outta the 4 gems will post what reward is when I finish it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DerbSowalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've been hunting entrance area for several hours, and I can't seem to get any gems to drop.  Where did you get your gems to drop Del?  Any suggestions would be helpful.  Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Delowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well there are other undead areas that they drop in, they dont drop around the entrance you have to move in deeper.</div></div><hr />
