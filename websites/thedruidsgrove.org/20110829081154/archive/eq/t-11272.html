I don't know enough about the mechanics of what they do exactly (other than stun resists will...help you resist stuns...and give you the 'you shake off the stun effect'. Is very helpfull).<br />
<br />
Avoidance I read to be kinda like Lightning Reflexes in that it's another number to roll vs the attack hitting you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thornsong</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stun Resist reduces your change of being stunned by x%, whether its from a mob hitting on you or from an AE.  For a caster who casts heals, any delay in timing can cause problems.  It maxxes at 35%.  Even if you are not a raider, this is something that you want to concentrate on.<br />
<br />
Avoidance, which caps at 100, works like lightning reflexes I am told.  It is good to get, but not essential.  A couple of more important ones in my eyes are DoT Shielding and Spell Shielding.<br />
<br />
Spell Shielding reduces the amount of damage you take via spells by x%.  It maxes at 35% so a person on a 1000-point nuke, a person with maximum spell shielding would only take 650 points of damage.  That’s the effect explained in the simplest method.  Avoiding damage is greater in my mind than hit points because hit points would have to be healed or replaced.  It is always better to avoid damage when you can.  I value this over hit points and mana because, in today’s Everquest, most encounters have some form of AE damage.  If you are not a raider, then this ability drops way low on my standings.<br />
<br />
Damage over Time Shielding is almost identical to spell shielding and is as valuable.  It reduces the amount of damage you take versus damage over time spells by x%.  It also maxes at 35%.  This is also greater than hit points or mana in my eyes if you are a raider.  Again, if you are not a raider, then this ability drops very low in priority.</div></div><hr />

Could someone confirm that? I've read that stun resist only gives you a chance to CONTINUE casting a spell if you get stunned mid-cast. It does nothing to avoid stuns and does not allow you to start casting spells while stunned. Like channeling works on moving / getting hit.<br />
<br />
As far as usefulness, I don't think DoT shielding is as important as spell shield. You can cure / heal the dot, but there's nothing you can do if you have 6K hp and get nuked for 6K other than resists / spell shield.</div></div><hr />

You may be thinking of the AA - Persistant Casting.</div></div><hr />

Stun resist works on spells and melee.  If you resist it the stun does not affect you at all.  Spells continue casting and you do not get stunned.  This mod is very helpful on 3 of the 6 anguish named, but outside of Anguish I can't recall any time this would be a mod you would really notice helping.<br />
 <br />
I agree with Thorn on Spellshielding / DoT shielding.  They are a great help in keeping you alive and I have always concentrated on getting them as close to max as possible while looking at stun resist, avoidance, and shielding after those 2 mods.</div></div><hr />

This is definitely true. The least important ones for us (in my opinion, of course) are shielding and avoidance. Those two deal directly with incoming melee attacks and therefore are better suited to tank types. That's not to say you should pass when an item drops that has shielding on it...just remember who the effects are most useful for when an aug drops that has x% shielding on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">medlin1</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a raiding druid Avoidance and shielding are both a great help.  They help keep you alive when the tanks are slow to pick up on adds and they come for us.  Stun resist is a godsend.  It raises the chances that you resist being stuned at all no matter if you are casting at the time or meleeing or just standing there.  When it is sucessfull you will get a message along the lines of &quot;you have shaken off the stun effects&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">05-11-2005, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shielding is useless. It works only on sustained melee attacks on you, that means it only works if you're tanking for a long time... which druids don't do at all.<br />
<br />
As a druid you want Spell shield and Dot Shielding more than anything. Avoidance is really awesome for us as well, but not a raid requirement. Stun resist is mucho important too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should not sacrifice Foci or FT to gain these.  These are only worth adding after you have your basics covered.</div></div><hr />
