<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">10-15-2006, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I am the only Druid in my guild that uses Sylvan Infusion--at least, this is what I can see through Spell Awareness. I am having trouble because in some content areas, SI does not seem to be doing as much. Things change, mobs hit for more, et cetera.<br />
<br />
I use debuffs regularly when I heal, I am missing healing AA but will address that after I am 75. I don't feel as though I have the mana pool to sustain chaining something like Pure Life or Chloro. I am (and this is being generous) 'middle endish' in terms of gear.<br />
<br />
Have very many of you found that SI isn't enough? At what point to did you transition, if you are using another spell? Or is this simply an AA problem, and I'll be able to get more mileage out of SI than I think?<br />
<br />
Danke,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">10-15-2006, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SI heals for 2441.  With Max Adept your looking at 28% iirc, which brings it upto a 3124 base heal.  With a 30% Heal focus (obtainable from Jailer, and on both PoR Armor sets) your looking at an average heal value of 3593, and a max heal value of 4061, with criticals at 7186 and 8122.<br />
<br />
Because the heal is dated, you would need to be killing things which do less then 3593 within SI's recycle time to make this a primary healing method on a tank.  Due to the fact those mobs are no longer that common you would realistically be better off using Karana's Renewal if you can work in a 10 second window, or swicthing to an upgraded heal.<br />
<br />
Chlorotrope heals for 2810, which is 3596 after adept.  Same healing focus and you get an average heal of 4136 and a max heal of 4674, with critals of 8272 and 9348.<br />
<br />
With an average heal of 4136, you should be fine to heal nearly all content, while still working fairly close to any mana pres and healing focuses you may have.<br />
<br />
I still use SI as a patch heal except in healing something like Frostcrypt.  You would want to use CT or Pure Life on a tank class however, since a 3.5k average heal is not apt to do much on them.  If the healing AAs your missing are Adept AAs, then these values would be lower then what I am showing and this would be where your issue is.<br />
<br />
Obviously, Gift AAs decrease the amount of heals you need since some of them would critical, making the using of a weaker heal easier on you.<br />
<br />
Finally, it depends on the content and how long you have to heal.  If its a short fight using a higher powered heal may not be a bad idea, but if the fight is more duration based, using a weaker one may be the way to go since it would allow you to get more spells in and use less mana on overhealing.</div></div><hr />

But now, raceing up to 75 to use ancient chloro and adrenaline surge is the way to go.  Once you get focii that work 100% with 71+ spells then switch topure life and adrenaline surge.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the numbers, it helps.</div></div><hr />

Now with TSS I have replaced SI with Adrenaline Surge because 3 single target heals is just too many to keep memmed.  I always liked SI because it was cheaper yet just high enough of a level to get GoM to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seeker</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also switched to Ancient Chloro / Adrenaline Surge / Moonshadow as my standard heal lineup although SI still makes the odd appearance on raids and when mana usage may be an issue.<br />
<br />
As for our (in)Complete Heals I've stopped using them completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you said is exactly the same course as I followed.<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion doesn't (unless it crits heals) really cover a good round from say a mob in Ashengate.</div></div><hr />

SI is high enough for GoM... doesn't overheal as much and is cheaper than the other spells (which are not that much more effective % wise when you factor in Overheals).  Raids I have: SI, Adren Surge, Moonshadow... That combination works well... I typically use Adren just to proc the mitigation for fun most of the time since SI lets me heal well enough.</div></div><hr />
