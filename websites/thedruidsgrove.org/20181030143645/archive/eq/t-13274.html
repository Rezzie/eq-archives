<br />
From The Runes:<br />
In the Ruins of Takish-Hiz to left of zone in Lilthill's Ghost gives tasks. One of them The Chalice of Life shows as a reward a belt. When I completed the task I got the belt and the above spell scroll to scribe (well aura scroll I guess). Task is to kill 4 golems one for each season.<br />
<br />
I recieved Spell: Aura of the Grove This Task is soloable.<br />
<br />
Im assuming the other task that Lilthill's Ghost gives could also be another spell, I tried it and got my ass handed to me, 6 yellow con Chancelors standing next to each other in The Elder Forest, definately need a group for that one and a damn good puller.<br />
<br />
Im thinking this guy more then likely is the Aura spells for possibly all classes that recieve them, Im also going to assume that given the difficulty of the task that the reward is going to be the lvl 70 Aura of Life.<br />
<br />
Just alot of assumptions but wtf It worked the first time around.</div></div><hr />

I completed a set of Takish Hiz missions. They started with a sand elf in North Ro and eventually the Takish Hiz queen started giving them out. Three missions took about four hours to complete and rewarded a level 70 Aura spell for my cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
So we've found both Aura's assuming the Druid Aura is from the same series (and it probly is).<br />

They must have changed it recently then cause we done it a couple of times and only one Summoned.  Also on the bottom of this thread says that Moonshadow spell is still unknown how to get it. Can we get that updated.  It is now won upon completion of the Skylance Quest 3.</div></div><hr />
