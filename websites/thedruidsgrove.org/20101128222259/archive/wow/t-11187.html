<br />
I'm thinking about the +55 to healing, but it's very expensive, so I need to be sure of sticking with Finkles in the long term to invest in that.<br />

But if you see yourself getting something else soon and relegating this to fights where you need the extra fire resist, then save your money and don't bother with an enchant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's definitely something to consider.  Sure, you lose +25 Healing; however, in the big picture of things +30 spell dmg might come in handy.<br />
<br />
I am in the process of changing my aurastone hammer from +55 heal to +30 dmg/heal.  On my priest I went from +22 int to the +30 spell/dmg, and on my shaman I went +30 spell<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that the +30 dmg/heal enchant is now the best overall enchant in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is spending several hundred gold on an enchant worth it now, or is it like putting an end-game enchant on leveling gear?</div></div><hr />

As druids, we have easy access to northern felwood.  You can get essences of water, and living essences from the irontree woods.  The toxic water elements give you essences of water and the treants give you living.<br />
<br />
A rightous orb will drop 100% of he time off the archivist.  They are easier to obtain than before.<br />
<br />
The rest can be DE'd.<br />
<br />
Mine took me about 2 weeks to farm/buy off the AH.  I'd log on and check for cheap essences on the AH and bid on them.  If I got them great, otherwise I'd farm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Great guide at this site.  Still active.  What I used to level my enchanting to 300.  Couldn't be happier about dropping herb for enchanting for my SHoTM.  <br />
<br />
Not too expensive to get to 265.  the trip from 245 - 265 is the hardest IMO, but if you are patient it will be cheap.  If you want to do it quickly, a hundred gold or so will get you there</div></div><hr />

JWK, ty for info, didnt know that, gives another perspective to it, I you are balance specced or thinking about becoming I sure would go for +30 spell.</div></div><hr />
