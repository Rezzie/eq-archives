<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">05-16-2005, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it all depends on your build. If your doing a lot of pvp with a balance or restoration build you want int/sta. For a lot of solo pve stuff with a caster build int/spi is a bit more important. If your playing a full feral build, I would stick with sta/str, for a partial feral build sta/int would probably work best. Most druids at lvl 60 have a build with 31 in restoration for innervate, 11 in feral for bear charge, and 10 in balance for roots. I personally have 35 points into feral and the rest into restoration at lvl 46, wearing nothing but sta/str with a few points into agi and int. I also have  a seperate set of gear that is all sta/int/spi for when I am running instances so I can play healer if I need to. I guess the most important thing IMHO is stamina, no matter what build your using, and the rest depends on how you play.</div></div><hr />

I'm just obsessed with stamina :P all the power in the world doesn't do a bit of good if you can't live long enough to use it. I would drop some of that monkey gear and swap it out for some whale gear, or even boar. Spirit is never a bad thing, it's more important than agi unless your relying on melee crits for damage. If your using a balance build and working off of a lot of nukes, the more int you have the better. A lot of int will give you not only a large mana pool, but a good chance for your spells to crit, while a restoration build is going to want survivabiltiy. lots of health and mana regen make it easier for you to do so.</div></div><hr />

My changes, reflecting my opinion, not to far out of line.  I also am a stamina freak, you have to have the hp to stay up in the upper levels, if you can't take 3-4 hits and have enough to keep doing you job, you won't be very effective.  My current build, with MOW only has 6300 mana and 3400 hp, I truly wish for more, but that seems the best I can muster right now, would love to trade out my owl staff for an eagle if one ever shows up before I can manage a trindlehaven.<br />
<br />
Spirit has never been a big issue with me, I have always strove to maintain a minimun tick of 50, with my current build holding 56, my full casting build (3050hp/6600mana) holding 67 per tick, has always been sufficient for innervate on myself to get through a tough spot.  The vast majority of the time your grouped, you will likely be innervating your priest, if not priest, again, your base innervate is enough to get you out of most issues.  You can get divine spirit perhaps from a holy priest, you can stock up on the +30 spirit crystals out of Ungoro, and you can stock up on the +50 spirit buffs out of the area outside nethergarde keep, all will help a solid amount if you choose an &quot;eagle&quot; type build over a more spirit oriented build.  I also make sure I have lots of conjured water, highest level available, and am dropping and juicing anytime I drop out of combat, even if it's just for a few moments before I have to pop up and heal.<br />
<br />
For PvP, I'm still striving for full wildheart as I want to see just how much all that spirit will help in a protracted battle.</div></div><hr />

I would, generally say, it's a build set that's more &quot;jack of all trades&quot; which is what the druid is.  If you had to have only one set, that would be the one to have.  I think most druids carry more than one set, as it's not very hard to put together individual sets that exceed wildheart in numerous areas more specific to the use the set you built is intended for. <br />

Amen to 2 armor sets.  You will find that some items are a nice balance between the 2 stats most of us consider important (e.g. Eagle gear).  Right now, I have 3-4 pieces of gear I swap in/out - Weapon (staff or dagger/OH), Shoulders, Back, and rarely Chest (that will change when I get a better INT chest item).<br />
<br />
If I know I'm going to do a PvP raid/group, I -always- equip full STA gear.  As leather wearers and healers, we are frequently targeted first for kill.  For me, a death purely because I was out of mana never happened.  Maybe had 1 or 2 people escape from me, but that's in the minority.  I only go with my full INT/caster set once I'm inside an instance and only then if I am main healer.</div></div><hr />
