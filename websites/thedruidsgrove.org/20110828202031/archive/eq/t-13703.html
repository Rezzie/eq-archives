That made me LOL.<br />
If anything, this makes you less use to your guild if you spend 6 seconds every minute to get on your uber 40 dps dot :) Sure there's some encounters where using it doesn't interrupt anything... <br />
 <br />
Honestly, I don't remember when was the last time I used it in a raid. For soloing I always use it of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">04-17-2006, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does 60+ dps for me, average. Average damage per cast is 3500+, rarely resists.<br />
 <br />
If you have AHV and BoD, dots cast in 1.7. So, with mem`d dots, you cast a spell, wait 2.25, cast for 1.7, wait another 2.25, than your able to cast another spell. Total = 6.2 second. Technically every cast with an orb is the same as a memable spell with a cast time of 1.5 (same cast time for dots with AHV and ang bp clicky), and on top of that it's manaless. If your a top end druid you should be savvy with features like cycle npc, bandolier, toggle target, and targeting mid cast via mouse on group members. So all in all, it's worthwhile in most situations.<br />
 <br />
if you spend 6 seconds every minute<br />
 <br />
Use common sense.  You don't need to keep it on religiously, take note of when it wears off and renew it when you get a chance.</div></div><hr />

Did you not look at the link I posted of what I replaced??? This has more mana/hp than my old range item. More hitpoints mean I can take another whack before I die and more mana = another heal or nuke I can get off.<br />
 <br />
You people who have no job and do nothing but eat twinkies in your parents basement while playing EQ 23 hours a day can just kiss my furry ass. My guild is just trying to break everyone into Qvic so that we can progress farther. If you can't handle people still trying to push through content they have never done before, just keep quiet.<br />

Orb is an awesome upgrade, and even if it's rarely used on raids* it's something that I use religiously whenever soloing. It will never get destroyed.<br />
<br />
On a side note, a druid in an old guild of mine once turned down bidding on an orb (she was the only druid without one) because she really liked the 2 hp regen on her Glowing Stone of Expulsion. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70179) Needless to say, it made me want to cry.<br />
<br />
*seeing as you're about to get into qvic, it's worth telling you that when you start fighting m'shas, your only real source of DPS will me magic-based spells. So that means anything with a Time Lapse proc, AE nukes (if you're feeling particularly brave), and magic DoTs. The orb really comes in handy at this point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">04-18-2006, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks you guys. Sorry about blowing up, but that post really rubbed me the wrong way. Sheesh, stupid game and message boards getting to me. And I've always been a complainer. (happy sailor = bitching sailor)<br />
 <br />
Anyway, I've been Qvic flagged since last November. But, either someone is already camping M`shas or no one wants to help. I have killed the trio two times now, but lost randoms on the gear (2ish groups). I did get the aug tho, very nice 90 mana put into my 1.5 clicky stick.<br />
 <br />
But, right now we are concentrating on winning Uqua again to flag the rest of the guild. Half of us either weren't on when we won, or had to log. And now we have a lot of new members that need it as well. Looking back, beating Uqua was pure luck. I can't wait to see the game beyond GoD.</div></div><hr />

Lucy is better because there's no pop ups, it loads 10x as fast, gives you more detailed stats, and is far more pleasing to the eyes.</div></div><hr />

Do yourself a favor and download firefox and the Adblock extension.<br />
<br />
While you're at it, load up google and do a search for &quot;HOSTS file&quot;<br />
<br />
Now you don't have to worry about popups or annyoing ads!<br />
<br />
But yeah, all the same... Lucy &gt; Firefox. It's just quicker loading and easier to look up raw stats and changes.</div></div><hr />

Pop ups aren't a problem for me, but they are for a lot of people.<br />
 <br />
On allas, it seems like most of the lag is caused by the popups.  Even when my popup blocker is on -- the site will lag for a bit, I see the popup blocked counter go up, than it'll load quickly.  I'm hardly a computer expert, but I guess the way they code their popups creates lags.<br />
 <br />
CLIFF NOTES: allas = n00b, lucy = good</div></div><hr />

<br />
kakaka, things that make you go hmm.  And yeah, the pop-ups lag the main Allakhazam site like a mo fo.  I got premium so I don't have to deal with lag much and a few features I miss when I let premium expire, so I renewed.</div></div><hr />
