<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know we have a thread on druid clickers, but I am interested in druid usable inta clickers for crap buffs to combat dispell.  Does anyone know of any low cost, unlimited charge insta clickers for this purpose.  <br />
<br />
I realize that server economy plays a part in this but any general ideas will help.  I am a casual player that spends one day a week raiding.  My bank account ususally only has 3 to 4 k in it.<br />
<br />
I don't mind saving for something but want the cheapest I can find.  Would be nice if it was usable from inventory.  Thanks for any help you can give.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Telescope is one. crafted and cost only a like 500 pp or so. You can also get the Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring off Lake of III omen , cost about 1 to 2 k on my server. Can also do the Coldain ring 8 quest, only take about 2 days. Result is Velium Coldain Insignia Ring with a instant click 8 point damage shield.  Hope it helps !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want a free one, find the Kromzek Surveyor in Wakening Lands.  He drops the Kromzek Surveyor Scope, usable from inventory:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=30221<br />
It's normally used for a long quest for a 10 wis ring.<br />
<br />
From my experience a spyglass (tinkered, not the one above) has been around 50-100pp in the bazaar on my server.<br />
<br />
I use a combination of the spyglass and the 8th coldain ring when I need instaclickies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MegaBuzzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its it possible to solo to the 8th ring or do you need a group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Easily soloable, from the low to mid 50's on I'd say.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a bracer of the hidden.  Cost me like 5kpp on Morell thule.  (Our economy is fubar though, should cost half that on other servers)  It has the added benefit of see invis being the clicky which is handy for people without it.<br />

Maybe he's not up.<br />

Trackable from Kael zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Galamar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try the Bangle of Disease Warding from the Plane of Disease.  It's a quest where you have to collect skins from several named mobs in the zone.  None of them summon and can be easily root/dotted.<br />
<br />
Of course, PoD is broken on Bristlebane with mobs disappearing and gathering underground.. so you track to one and 6 mobs appear to attack you.  Ugh.  However, if the plane is not broken on your server then I'd go for it.<br />
<br />
It's a instaclick of Resist Disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's broken like that on TM too, they're not getting stuck underground, they're getting stuck in rocks, hairs, or pusling hut walls,<br />
<br />
The &quot;Pathing Changes&quot; in the patch a few months ago we have to thank for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Malrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Are any of the above items self only buffs from inventory? I know the AoN is but that is a pain to get. I am currently using Bangle of Disease Warding but I hate to have to target myself to use it. Anything else that out there that you do not have to target yourself in order to use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Balise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Coldain ring 8-10 is a self only instant clicky, but the 10th ring effect doesnt stack with some regens (not sure if it has been changed sinceinitial) and I believe the ring has to be worn, but if you dont mind the sacrifice in stats (if you have a really good ring) then the ring is pretty decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nimchip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i got my Shrunken Goblin Earring from Warlik's Woods pretty fast.. very easy just get all the goblins go to a corner and Catastrophe lol you will get it in no time!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>TauTropfen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am using the Veracity Earring as an insta clicky, as Seru nowadays is a long, but rather easy fight... just involves some camping, but it doesn't cost you any money (well, the 200pp you need for the 2 drinks in the beginning)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Phylactery is instant and inventory clickable too!</div></div><hr />
