<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">12-24-2005, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see this as a huge topic for some people in reguards to things taken away from us.  Below is a history as best as I can manage - where exactly in this was it taken?<br />
<br />
Orignally, a Druid had to level to 19, and travel either with another druid, or more proable, by foot to the Druid Ring in West Commonlands and obtain thier first 4 Portal Spells.  (Which would take you to Faywder, Odus, and East and West Antionica)<br />
<br />
As a Druid gained power, additonal locations opened up, and Regional Succor spells became avaialble. Becoming accessable at the appoximate level of the area which you would in theory be hunting.  IE, Succor East was added in the 20s when you where apt to be expericing in High Hold Keep, or Split Paw.  This trend continued until 49, when Succor Lavastorm was added, allowing groups who fought in Nagafen's Lair quick safety.<br />
<br />
As time went on, and the game expanded, Kunark was rediscovered (it had been known previously to the Combine Empire), our spells where expanded to include the Combine Ring in the Dreadlands.  Since most people would at the time, not survive the Dreadlands, porting there wasnot somethign typically advised.<br />
<br />
Futhermore, our Kunark Only Spells - for those that remember, Teleported us to Skyfire (a death trap for lower levels), and The Emerlad Jungle (which would be useful as Sebilis was discovered and grouped wanted a Evac Caster for deeper exp camps).<br />
<br />
Post 50, the Druid and Wizard classes gained the power to Abscond and Egress as well as their respective group versions - allowing The Caster, or the Group, safety from combat situations without the run back to the location the lower Succor spells lacked.<br />
<br />
What alot of people do not remember, or in most cases, do not remember today, is the Timorus Deep was bindable orginally.  Within this Ocean was a chamber of fire pots which would allow free range of movement to most of the Cities of Norrath.  That chamber is still there, and last I checked - Still works.  Keep in mind, that using Boats, and thus travel through the Timorous Deep was far more common in this time frame, and people who wanted to chance it could travel all over.<br />
<br />
When Velious was located by Gnome Pirates, only the inital Portal to Iceclad was made available.  This was *not* a safe port for many of the level 34 Druids who tested it, much in the same way as Druid's who attempted to run the Dreadlands in Wolf Form, often met face to face with Gorenaire herself.<br />
<br />
Travel to deeper areas of Velious required a Fang from the Dragon Statue located with-in - for EACH person.  The Great Divide Fang was the most accessable and often druids where limited to there intinally.  Our Teleportion spells where dropped (at least at first) and only existed in group versions (again, at least at first).<br />
<br />
To obtain the Wakening Lands Fang, one had to either sneak<br />
past the Giants of Kael or fight their way into the city and beyond.  Once in Tunare's Blessed Forest, we had to either befriend, or sneak by the Guardian of that Portal, a Dragon known as Woushi (which is why alot of Teleporters with bad dragon factions flat out refused to use this location).<br />
<br />
Travel to Cobalt Scar required the above, but instead of Facing a single dragon, either slaying Dragon-kin in Skyshrine for the Key to access Cobalt Scar, or doing thier missions to earn their trust and be awarded the key.<br />
Once the key was obtained, a single click and a walk across a snow covered cliff was all that was required to obtain the Scar Fang.<br />
<br />
Clearly, upto this point, Teleportion required a great deal of work, and was in several cases, still fairly dangerous even to the Teleporter if the local they where going to was outside of the Old World.<br />
<br />
When Luclin came out, if you where not a wizard, there was only ONE way to the Shadow Maiden's Moon - you accessed a Greater Spire that Grieg had built for the Combine Empire before Seru's attack.<br />
<br />
Everyone had to travel by spire unless you could gate to the moon. Once on the moon, you had to walk - on foot to where-ever you where going. This lasted for Several months, and lead to alot of people being bound on the Moon to cut travel time.<br />
<br />
Directly Prior to the Planes of Power Release, Both Druids and Wizards where granted Access to 4 of Luclin's Regions.  But this change was differant for it was the first time ever Druids and Wizards had a direct Teleport to a Non Spire / Ring location (excluding the Wind of North / South Spells).  A Trend, which is seems is going to last - even tho I personally miss the Rings of Old.<br />
<br />
With Planes of Power release, Druids gained the ability to Teleport there, as well as Books becoming available for general use.  Druids and Wizards still retained free range of movement, but other classes could - with time, cross the same great spans of space we moved through an in instant.<br />
<br />
The limitations where similar to the Nexus Spires, but not as harsh.  Primarly the person had to travel to near an existing City, Cross into the Plane of Knowledge, then exit near another City.  However. at the time of release, I would venture most players hunted in Luclin or regions of  Velious as well as possiably the distant region of Sebilis.  This made Knowledge however, the defacto centeral hub of EQ.<br />
<br />
Basically, PoK is a two way firepot system which was released 3 years prior during Kunark.  The Primarly differance between the two systems - aside from being two way, is that PoK is more accesable.<br />
<br />
Yeska comes out and shortly after we are given a Portal to Stonebrunt Mountians, expanding our access to Odus and well as the newly found Gulf of Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Events continue to unfold in Norrath's History, and The Lost Dungeons are located.  The Wayfayer's bring their Farstone Magic to Norrath, which can send people between camps, and in certain cases, increase rate of movement, esp if a  Camp was near a book - as it is in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
Druids and Wizards could each teleport to two of these zones directly anyway, and landing in either one would speed the Druid/Wizard up nearly as much as anyone else seeking a way to any of the other 3 Camps.<br />
<br />
As an interesting Side Effect, the Magus's allowed easy acess to Permafrost Keep, around 2 years after it was common to see Lady Vox raids going on.<br />
<br />
The Gates of Discord Release saw Direct Teleportion to the Broken Shores, Although it was 3, and still remains 2, Magus Jumps currently for any non teleporting player.<br />
<br />
The Bardinu Portals where added later, and the location would later go on to be added to the Guild Hall's Teleporter System, but Natambi still reamins the Port of choice for most guilds who are advancing in the Gates of Discord, due to the closeness of the stone that sends you to Kod'Taz, or the Nilhi who helps you visit the Prayer Grounds of Calling.<br />
<br />
When Omens was released, a Priests of Discord could open a rift and send you to the world of Kuaa.  Quests for futher portals existed, and upon completing them you could travel across the planer barrier and Arrive either at the Bloodfields, or the Walls of Slaughter.<br />
<br />
These portals elimited the need for crossing of Dranik's Scar and the Nobles' Causeway, and provided fairly close access to both upper end areas of the Expansion - Ruined City, and MPG/RS/Anguish. I believe, for this reason more then anything, the Guild Teleporter can send you to Walls of Salughter - but not Bloodfields.  <br />
<br />
It is important to note however, that unlike previous systems or travel methods the Portals to Discord again place the Porter and Group they carry in a region which is hostile to them once they leave the portal area.<br />
<br />
Dragons of Norrath was released, and the existing Portals of Lavastorm and Nek forest however, once again became more active with the Lavastorm region seeing heavy traffic to The Broodlands.<br />
<br />
The Guild Hall Teleporter system was also added, with it would seem, a eye toward sending people to the more popular areas - at a cost.  The Slaughter stone for instance, requires a regeant of 200~ Platium to adjust the porter to that local.   <br />
<br />
The porter seems to focus mostly on raid areas, or areas which have group trial content for players.  It does leave out several portals, leaving them totally in the hands of Wizards and Druids (Wakening Lands, Bloodfields, Natimbi come to mind off hand).<br />
<br />
This system has several downsides, including being totally centeralized - as every public access system before it, as well as being a one way trip.  You are also required to be guilded to access the system - the first system to require guildstatus.<br />
<br />
When Depths hit the stores, a single new portal was added - that of Undershore, which while lacking in Lore reasoning, is fairly centeralized in terms of the expansion.  Typically, Undershore is with in any 2 zones of the expansion.<br />
<br />
--- My View follows<br />
<br />
Quite Personally, The Game has grown to immense scale, and Teleportion is considered a fairly required part of life now.  The extra systems took nothing away from the Druid's power to teleport to their full range of locals, as we as do so when they deem best.<br />
<br />
The Druid, or the Wizard, is not subject to having to use one of Grieg's Spires, rely on the Wayfayer's Farstone Magic, depend on the Guild Teleporter or even be forced to place their hand upon one of Knowledge's Books.  They can go anywhere - from anywhere, when they want without exception.<br />
<br />
The down sides are few.  <br />
<br />
One could say the loss of revinue for druids and wizards has hurt, but considering all the people I see offering to pay for portals to locations deemed to expensive or time consuming otherwise, I would consider this arguement subject to being weak.<br />
<br />
One could also say, that people are missing most of the game, bypassing zones without ever seeing them. On this, I agree.  I would have rather have left the fang requirement of old in Velious intact.  However, I believe the Developers are also doing a decent job of teleporting in reguards to landing in a place where you are probly best off in the company of a Druid or Wizard (for Invis, Lev, etc).<br />
<br />
I also think having a more centerlized area for players - such as Knowledge, was a good move as it allows players to interact with each other more now that the game has expended from a mere 3 Regions to 5, a Moonscape, and several alternate planes.  The game is huge, and I totally believe you require a centeralized system to preserve player community.<br />
<br />
Having played Games like Guild Wars - where every player can &quot;teleport&quot; to a City or Outpost they have been to, it makes the world feel very small.  While one could argue this was done to EQ, the world here is far more expansive - and dangerous, then Guild Wars has ever been.<br />
<br />
Stepping through the Rift as a Druid for the first timeis wonderful, and as our powers grow so does our range of movement.  This has only ever been added to our class, and not stripped.  <br />
<br />
People argue we lost this advantage over the other classes.  I do not see this as true.  We, as I have stated - Can move to Anywhere, from anywhere - at anytime.  While the use of teleportion spells has lost its mystisim to a great degree, it has not yet been replicated in any way shape or form to what we are able to do.<br />
<br />
So while other classes may not rely on us as much for travel, saying we have lost the ability to be special while traveling is a false statement, and until those other systems grant you levitate, fixed duration invisability, and speed increases to add in travel, we remain as always - One of the masters of rapid movement across Norrath.<br />

<br />
Back before Pok, before the nexus spires, the only way to get around at all quickly was by getting a druid (or to a lesser extent wiz, please consider them included in all the rest) to port.  It was one of the truly class defining abilities that we had and was one of the chief reasons we were in demand.  In many of the early discussions about class balance porting was raised as one of our big advantages.<br />
<br />
The spires, pok, the magi, the return aa and the guildhall have all worn away at usefulness of porting, rendering a once vital ability now little more than a trick.<br />
<br />
Before you reject that idea too strongly...try and think back a bit.  At one time the ooc about LF a port and the ooc about porting to all druid locations was everywhere.  It was by far the most common ooc that you would see.  Now take a moment to count the ooc, see how many calls for KEI or cleric buffs you get compared to the rare call for a port.  <br />
     This is a MAJOR change in the game over time.<br />
<br />
Having a porter in the group at one time meant huge time savings, for some areas it was pretty much required (porting to CS in the old days comes to mind.  Now a porter will speed things up by a couple zones in most cases, altho with the guild hall ports even that edge is often missing now. <br />
<br />
One less reason to need a druid in the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So this boils down to my point that over the years one of the druids original defining abilities has gradually been watered down to a minor convenience.<br />
<br />
      With nothing given to us as compensation.<br />
<br />
I say that because the issue really hasnt been addressed, it hasnt come up primarily because it has been a gradual process.  We never lost much at any step, so it wasnt a big deal.  Taken overall, it has certainly cut way down on the need for druids.<br />
<br />
Something to consider...it has changed a great deal with very little noise.<br />

<br />
Just a couple comments.<br />
You omitted the not overly relevent fact that during the Luclin days, the Nexus became a sort of central hub that PoK now is. Just seems worth mention because it was such a lively part of the game for it's short life.<br />
<br />
I would have rather have left the fang requirement of old in Velious intact. <br />
<br />
I think this would be awesome as long as they incorporated the key ring so we could lose the fangs after we get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">12-24-2005, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing which probly plays into this a large extent, is the ease of CRs now that the Guild Lobby is in place, and prior to that - the PoP graveyards.<br />
<br />
This makes teleporting back to point of death a minimum concern.<br />
<br />
Another issue is - as I mentioned, the Guild Hall is one way.  You thus see more asking for ports at a given destention, rather then getting there I think.<br />
<br />
It would see your primary arguement is that becuase we are not in demand as a taxi service - something I personally have always disliked - we have lost the  power to preform that service.<br />
<br />
That statement makes no sense.  We can port to far more places with greater ease then ever before - again, whenever we want.  And while that may seem a trick, or something unspecial - we are not limited in the amount of times we may do this, not by regant, or by AA timer.<br />
<br />
We have full range of movement totally.<br />
<br />
Much as asking for various buffs has become common place, c3 Nexus Chanters anyone?  The demand on getting there has lessened and the capability to survive once there increased.<br />
<br />
Quite personally, and I am probly in the minority, think that is a postive change for the game.  I do not think the game should rely or be centeric on Druids or Wizards for travel.  <br />
<br />
At this point, the game is simply to large.  People can and will no longer justify a 2 hour run from Ak'Anon to the Towers of Erudian to learn a rare spell which wasn't available in the underground libary of the gnomes.<br />
<br />
Sony seems intent on lowering downtime while raising what you do with the time you do play - making certain aspects of the game more common, or casual if you will.  This is a smart business move.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really believe however, if and only if, they remove our full range of movement, or give other classes the power to move anywhere as we do - at will, will we have lost something worth complaining about.<br />

 <br />
If everyone takes one step forward and your class does not then you can argue that nothing was taken away but your class was weakened by nature of all other classes becoming more powerful.<br />
 <br />
I'm glad the port system is in place but I wish Druids got something in return. <br />
 <br />
What? Well I feel Druids and Wizards should get a 2nd bind port that we can group port to. It would have the same bind restrictions but it would allow some flexability that would re-establish Druids and Wizards to be true masters of fast travel.<br />
 <br />
While we can currently have a second bind point it is self only. Being able to have a group bind would be enough compensation to make up for losing &quot;most&quot; of the advantages of ports.<br />

<br />
I was one of those that had to run to Wakening lands to get the tooth and remember how hard it was trying to get there. My first attempt was running thru Kael dying to Giants. I believe the portal spell was originally only available by the merchant (forget the name of the npc) near PoG zone in and trying to get there wasn't easy either.<br />
<br />
Trying to make the plat to afford all those port spells was a lot of work. I did a lot of farming to earn money just to buy those spells since I never asked for money to port people.<br />
<br />
Maybe sony could reimburse us for all the money we spent buying spells made available thru the use of stones. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway fun reading this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">12-25-2005, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps I didnt make a couple of my points clearly enough.<br />
<br />
We are no longer needed to ferry groups around, thereby lowering our usefulness to groups, thereby lowering our ability to get groups.<br />
<br />
We have full range of movement totally...yes.  Our ADVANTAGE in movement has been drastically reduced.  Not only in old zones with all of the ways people have to travel now, but also in new areas where we get one port to undershore-- and so does everyone else from the guildhall.<br />
<br />
Yes the game has grown in size and people no longer have to spend so much time running.  This is overall a good thing for the game, but it has definitely removed one of the big reasons for other people to want to group with druids.<br />
<br />
Yes we can cast speed buffs, so can rangers, shaman and bards.  Plus every higher level caster already has a mount, as do a big chunk of the melees now so once again our RELATIVE travel advantage is reduced.<br />
<br />
I am not argueing that our own speed is in any way not improved by the changes, but that the advantage that we brought to others has been gutted.  We lost one of our original core group attributes.<br />
<br />
Its great for every other class that they can now get around with ease, but its bad for druids group getting ability.  A huge factor?  No, but if Im losing out on 10, 20 percent of the groups I should be getting its not a minor factor either.<br />
<br />
Giving us a second (group) bind point would certainly be one way of addressing this long term problem. <br />
<br />
<br />
We have lost one of the core group abilities, the speed ADVANTAGE we used to bring to groups.  It has been whittled away.  How many characters with even a handfull of aa do not have run3 now?.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not that we cant get ourselves around faster now, its that groups dont need us anymore.<br />

PS adding this....I dont want to get too strident on this but this whole topic mirrors a conversation I have been having with a cleric friend.  He was commenting on how much the corpse summoning aspect of the guildhall had removed the requirement of having a cleric in groups, and how it had now given druids all the grouping chances since people no longer had to have a rezzer in the group.  Im probably just a little testy about how much all of these changes over time have &quot;helped&quot; the druid class, heh.</div></div><hr />

If everyone takes one step forward and your class does not then you can argue that nothing was taken away but your class was weakened by nature of all other classes becoming more powerful.<br />
 <br />
<br />
The same arguement could be made for the Guild Lobby, all sets of the new Exilir potions, or even that the Prismatic/Primal Weapons from ST make Shamans less valuable in groups.<br />
<br />
Fact is tho, its only an aspect of a class, and not the entire class, and that, I think - is the defining differance between the two.<br />

<br />
<br />
I would disagree - If being able to cross vast amounts of space was the main reason to get a group - I could see your point.<br />
<br />
However, esp now with the Guild Lobby, I do not see getting there as the main reason to invite anyone - as anyone should be able to get there.<br />
<br />
I have far far more been asked to a group becuase I could Heal, Nuke, or Snare, then I have ever ever been becuase I could cast a Circle of X spell.<br />
<br />
If your group invites you because you can Succor, then you have STILL lost nothing becuase none of the in game systems can evac your group.  Only Wizards and Druids possess that power.<br />
<br />
I am personally rather confused as to why you think travel to / from somewhere was a major drawing point, as opposed to anything else can do - since, basically speaking, if we are grouped ... then we are not needed to cross vast distances.<br />

<br />
I totally believe that Druids are the masters of unaided movement.  <br />
<br />
However, even in the Lore Verant and Sony has created for Everquest - Wizards have been the masters of Teleporting.  From their Gates, Portals, Translocations and spell such as Decession, they've owned that market for quite awhile.<br />
<br />
The Lore referancing dates back to the Shissar Wizards building the Pyrmids, such as those seen in the Northen and Southren Areas of Ro in order to assist Rallos's Army in conquring the other gods races.<br />
<br />
This was expanded upon when the Geomancer Greig created the Spire System for the Combine Empire, and futher referanced when Al'Kabor used the spires in the Dreadlands to reopen access to Luclin, just as Grieg used them to send the Combine to the Moon centuries before.<br />
<br />
Incase you where likewise wondering, the Realms of Norrath: Freeport hints that the Fier'Dal Druids of Takish-Hiz and the Elddar Forest created the first Druid Ring in what is now the Southren Desert of Ro, in order to assist them with scouting areas of the world in an attempt to find something to save thier homeland from the Wrath of Solusek Ro.<br />

Incase you where likewise wondering, the Realms of Norrath: Freeport hints that the Fier'Dal Druids of Takish-Hiz and the Elddar Forest created the first Druid Ring in what is now the Southren Desert of Ro, in order to assist them with scouting areas of the world in an attempt to find something to save thier homeland from the Wrath of Solusek Ro.<br />

I am all for lore but SOE has broken their own roleplay so many times it is no longer relavant IMHO. The mythology of the game can be twisted to allow SOE to do near anything and unless we want to go back to &quot;the vision&quot; (I thought that much of the vision was a good thing but it was a bit too ridgid) then restricting ideas based upon an ever changing myth is no longer valid.<br />
 <br />
Personally I think that Druids need a focal point for teleportation and as such we should only be able to port to rings....<br />
 <br />
 <br />
BUT<br />
 <br />
We should also have undisputed charm ability over &quot;all&quot; animals and not just the ones SOE feels is not overpowering. Treeform will work in &quot;all&quot; outdoot zones....<br />
 <br />
WHat I am getting at is you can't have it both ways.... you remain true to the game mythos or you do not. At one point in time SOE at least tried to keep things a bit more roleplay oriented but the blurring of the class lines over the years as well as &quot;gameplay&quot; taking undisputed #1 position over roleplay has tossed out any semblance of the mythology of EQ.<br />
 <br />
I agree with you... SOE does not *smiles*<br />

Treeform has issues in relation to the gobal model.  It is not that it should not work in differant places, but with the way the model is in their database, the spell only fuctions when that model is available.  Since the model has not been redeisgned, the spell sits non useful.  Or, at least thats my understand of it.<br />
<br />
as far as charming Animals.  Most Druid RPG templates, such as in D&amp;D - only allow you to charm natural animals - IE, things found on earth.  Clearly this is not viable for an online game, and they have expanded it somewhat - hence why we can Charm Ferans (dog like), but not Chimera's (3 headed thinger).<br />
<br />
Finally, while lore is important - in some cases it has to be somewhat suspended for playability.  Less you want all servers to be like FV, with ooc disabled, shout limited range, etc etc.<br />
<br />
I feel Sony makes a decent attempt at balancing lore in the creation of content, and Ifind this esp to be true in DoD, where several missions have you make contact with Bosses such as Emporer and Bloodeye prior to being sent to kill them in a raid encounter.<br />

<br />
I enjoyed the summary of the old days - I remember the joy of getting my first port spells, avoiding certain locations like DL and Iceclad because they were too deadly, and the trials and tribulations of getting keys to the velious portals.  <br />
<br />
One thing that disappointed me was when Sony got too lazy to put a portal graphic at the spot where people ported to. I can think of no other reason than laziness - I guess they're prioritising their resources, but surely it makes sense that as civilization gains the ability to port to a certain place it puts up some walls, a ring, something... at that location.<br />
<br />
In terms of whether druids lost value as a result of these porting changes, one thing I haven't seen mentioned is the origin aa, or gate devices like the PoP necklace or the Overthere hammer.  These were total nonos under Brad's Vision (I clearly remember repeated statements that melee would never have the ability to gate), but I don't dispute for a second that their introduction (or the introduction of PoK books etc) was very good for the game.<br />
<br />
To the question of whether or not these changes devalued druids... I'd have to agree with Sliggoth.  Yes, druids were devalued.  The question is, how much, and whether the extent of the devaluing was significant.<br />
<br />
In terms of personal value, the druid hasn't been watered down at all.  I am with Fenier on this - one of the things I love most about my druid is being able to have personal freedom of movement - go anywhere at any time.<br />
<br />
In terms of group value, and the fact that once melee classes were simply stuck without porters, I don't see the devaluation as significant.  The only thing I can see that has been lost is where druids (and wizards) used to get groups where porters were required to get out (dungeon explorations etc). With gate items, origin etc, this is no longer necessary.<br />
<br />
Druids got the occasional group because of their ability to port someone to the fight location, but more realistically all this meant was money for one of the &quot;ooc taxi&quot; druids as someone went on their merry way, rather than a group invite. <br />
<br />
Succor still works fine, and every now and then you'll get a group because they need an evaccer.<br />
<br />
If anyone's suffering from this evolution in the game, it's Wizards.  Sure, they nuke pretty big.  But if you take away the benefit of porting, what have they got left?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the hammer, I bet they never thought PoP books would someday actually make it useful! I know I didn't bother with it for my troll until those books hit town, and then it was a matter of getting braids by the ton until people realised...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started on Cazic-Thule prior to the first server-split I have played long enough to be around for the first server-merger as well.  The currently developers seem to think EQ will be around several more years, so - as long as I keep playing I am apt ot be around for the next split or merger.<br />
<br />
That said, I seriously doubt Brad expected a prototype game format to last the 7 years it has considering the typical average life expecancy of games.<br />
