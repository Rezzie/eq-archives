<br />
Also lvl 32 is the best for a feral druid. Check out the spells you get eg. ravage.  Im lvl 34 and i can crit above 650.<br />
<br />
Also druids are the best flag carriers in wsg at lvl 20-39 that i know of, because of dash and travel form and their ability to heal and transform to remove speed reductions etc.<br />
<br />
Also if you are a tauren druid. Warstomp then regrowth is a good tactic</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 13/31/3 right now ( hit lvl 56 this weekend ).  <br />
<br />
If you're in caster you have to keep your distance.  Roots are you best friend.  Make sure you keep moonfire and Faerie Fire on them and thorns on you.  Nature's Grasp is a great tool when you get into a bind, you get wacked, they get rooted ( LOVE IT! ).  I think though that someone can only be rooted 3x before they are immune.<br />
<br />
So are you doing more 1 on 1 or are we talking WSG PvP stuff here?</div></div><hr />

Soon you'll get the improved bash talent (brutal impact), and cat form and feline swiftness, and then you'll come into your own, right now your best use is probably as a healer for the people who can kill things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least on my server, we hordies play a more offensive game, so usually only about 3 stay behind with the flag. Root the flag stealer -- gives people time to get to the person, especially if they picked up a speed buff in the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Though wsg got a lot more fun in the 26-29 range. Mmm cat form.</div></div><hr />
