Love the idea of auras, kudos to Sony.<br />
<br />
The range needs to be increased.  Druids aren't supposed to be close to the mob and tanks can't get the aura if you are not close.  Also, on raids, most of the raid will be out of range.<br />
<br />
The Aura of Life needs to be fixed since it currently cures less than Aura of the Grove (level 70 vs. level 55 spell).<br />
<br />
The cure effect should work on all problems, like the Radiant Cure AA, rather than just disease.<br />
<br />
If they change those things I will be very, very happy with it.</div></div><hr />

I thought they were AE but I now know they only affect people you are grouped with.<br />

I havent really noticed a big diffrence using solo or group style, this is because I am currently spending AA's into Healthy Aura so my regen rate has been<br />
changing constantly.<br />
<br />
I havent actualy noticed it really cure anything as of yet, has anyone? 55 or 70? If you have what was it? Im not sure Ive been actualy hit with anything lately thats disease based.<br />
<br />
I dont like the idea of it being AE Im not a bard no offense. Maybe at some point later AA's to make it AE would be ok but I would much rather see AA's strengthen the regen and Cure. <br />
<br />
Now my Husbands enchanter has the 55 and 70 aura's and being the crack whore that I am I make sure I am constantly in range of his aura :texla:</div></div><hr />

They're a nice little boost overall and aren't intrusive (taking up normal buff slots).  If they get our aura fixed to be curing 4 or 6 disease per tick I'm perfectly fine with what we got.  We can have a total of 90 regen / tick with blessing of oak, also get a decent curing component.<br />
<br />
Auras weren't meant to be big game changers so I wouldn't have expected much more out of ours.  They are mostly just a small bonus that adds up over the 30 minutes you have it on.  The only one which I feel is a bit overpowered compared to the others is the enchanter aura, but no complaints because it helps everyone in the group anyways.  Toss an enchanter in a group of wizards/mages on raids $$.</div></div><hr />

Can turn off the spell effects of auras in Options display tab.  Spell effects, player effects.  Just change to self only or turn off completely.  I had to do this as all the spell efects were seriously lagging me. <br />

The auras on instanced raids:  had Phase 2 and 3 of Time not spawn at first for us.  Had everyone TL out, then got spam and phases spawned.  Hope they fix this soon as I am a slow zoner..LOL.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
RAIDWISE:<br />
 <br />
For me Tacvi/Coa/Dodh events (pre DPoB)<br />
 <br />
Most of my problems curing come on events like Jelvan, AMV and things like Bloodeye.  Granted all these fights are doable with/without Auras, but unless I'm missing something I'll stick with boxing a shaman and casting Blood of Nadox to cure the group.<br />
<br />
 <br />
The cure rate is really too low atm too do much in these types of events, regeneration over a long period of time is acceptable but curing over a long period of time isn't that affective considering the dot has already run its course by the time it builds up enough counters to cure.  <br />
 <br />
Please enlighten me if there is something in DPoB or high end PoR this is a great spell for.<br />
 <br />
GROUPWISE<br />
 <br />
It will cure tash and slow?  I can hit RC6 already and do this, although I can see how it would be useful for someone that doesn't have many aa yet to help them and that is acceptable.  For me though?<br />
 <br />
I hate to sound like I don't like anything we get but especially now that pallys have their own version of reptile, unless the group heal is worth a  ...... these spells/auras are just junk filler our class doesn't need.  <br />
I'm starting to feel like, instead of giving us real utility spells, they are instead avoiding class balance issues/problems by making these kinda spells that really don't do anything.<br />
 <br />
Maybe I'm not mad as much as unimpressed so far with our aura.  Perhaps it would be better if it removed any detrimental affect, then I would understand the lower cure counter since that would be a powerful tool.  Or give us 2-3 auras that cure different things that don't stack.</div></div><hr />

* The aura window disappears when Escape button is pressed. Suffice to say, I press Escape a lot, to close bags etc.. and I'm from the oldskool console generation where rapidly pressing a single button defined your virtual penis size.. so go figure :)<br />

* Our regen aura, while it certainly does something (just like boon of the forest), isn't really noticable. Now before you start moaning, I just said : it certainly does SOMETHING. But I can't really say I'm jumping out of my seat like that WoW kid that just hit level 60 and ran through his dorm corridor screaming .... Yes, our 70 aura cures disease a bit. Woopteedoo ! I wish it cured poison, so I wouldn't have to RC every single time someone fears sudden death just because he has tash on him. &quot;OMG I'm tashed OH NOO!&quot; /sigh. Fix it so that at least it's a weaker version of pureblood , kinda like aria of innocence and ascetism rolled into one (bard cure songs) .. and I may actually start liking our aura.<br />
<br />
* Auras don't have a buff duration timer. Sucks. Often it fades (and because the window is removed by pressing escape, I don't see it fade from the corner of my eye) and I feel like a slacker noticing it only an avg. estimated 15 minutes later !<br />
<br />
<br />
* (non druid) Bards get a 30 overhaste aura at L70 that's easily accessible, while it's exactly the same (correct me if I'm wrong) as the Ancient: Call of Power song which you can only obtain from the big nameds in RSS and CoAnguish. Yes I know that was OoW expansion and we've progressed a couple expansions. But why this particular song? Why not give the bards .. oh I don't know, mana/regen aura or a generic haste+ds aura for example (!). Something that was easily accessible in the first place and not from a (near) end zone of a given expansion, that's the key phrasing.<br />
<br />
In conclusion:<br />
<br />
* Most of the auras aren't worth it imo. They're marginal (imo), you can live without them (not literal meaning, but in metaphorically speaking) .. with the exception of the enchanter aura and cleric aura which are actually quite nice.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this.  It should at least do poison as well, if not all bad stuff like RC<br />

Agree strongly with this.  Plus it seems to last only 30 minutes or so.  Come on here, I'm level 70, it is pretty lame to force me to recast something that often.  Make it 60 minutes and put in a timer.<br />
<br />
Note how lamely it was implemented.  It appears in the bard buff window but you need a separate window to remove it, unlike normal buffs which you can right click.<br />
<br />
I think this is due to the fact that they had to push it out the door in time for the expansion.  I predict that it will gain a timer soon.  I also predict that it will always have its own window because of the difficulty in just letting you right click and remove it from the bard window because EQ is spaghetti code.<br />
* (non druid) Bards get a 30 overhaste aura at L70 that's easily accessible, <br />
I don't know enough to comment on other classes auras.<br />

I think auras are SUPPOSED to be &quot;lame&quot;.  They are just added fluff.  Don't expect them to be very good.  They are nice.  But they aren't going to be incredibly useful.<br />
<br />
AMV (in Anguish) has been changed to make the druid aura very useful for that encounter.  I would guess that one or two others have also been changed for this.  That's about the only times the aura will be incredibly useful.<br />
<br />
The rest of the time it will be nice but not very useful.  They will not give us anything useful.  Because that would be &quot;overpowering&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is Sony we are talking about here.  Anything that massively helps the player is fixed right away.  Anything that massively hurts the player is fixed sooner or later (mostly).  Anything the somewhat helps the player is either limited off the bat or soon nerfed.  Anything that somewhat hurts the player is ignored or said to be part of &quot;risk vs. reward&quot; or as I put it, &quot;grind vs. reward&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm saying this because this is the rant area, so there!<br />
<br />
That said, I like auras if they would just put in a few fixes (what I said above plus increase the range).  A nice little extra that didn't cost (in time and effort) much.</div></div><hr />
