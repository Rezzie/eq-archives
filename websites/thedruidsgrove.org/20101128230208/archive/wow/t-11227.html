<br />
I've passed on thick qiraji belt a couple times, I know its really good mitigation and maybe It's been the wrong choice but I'm trying to max out my ac as much as I can so I use a lava belt. I leveled as resto long ago and didn't get a mark of tyranny so I'm missing out on a lot of AC right there, I use a smoking heart and stormpike rank 5 for the 2% dodge atm. Can't think of a much better bear trinket to use instead. Any ideas? Right now im almost 15 k AC selfbuffed. I've got a heavy dark iron ring, waiting on a signet or emp ring later. I use a elementium threaded cloak so a guess a cryptfiend silk cloak would boost me a bit. But can't think of much more AC upgrades for myself currently in the game. What is the highest AC a ddruid can get self buffed?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I picked up Blackhand's Breadth instead of Mark of Tyranny, so for tanking I use the exact same combo as you. When I get Drake Fang Talisman, I'll probably swap out my Stormpike Insignia. I'll lose 1% to dodge but gain 2% to hit and 56 attack power, which I think is preferable. <br />
<br />
Another option is to petition a GM for the Mark of Tyranny and give up the other trinket you got for the quest reward. They will only do a limited number of these, but I know they will do it because they did it for me. Now if they'll just switch it back for me. again...</div></div><hr />

Is it like 2 attack power equals one strength and agility? What is important in bear/cat form? what are the equations? I just want to know if i should go for gear with high attack power, or strength, or what...? My teacher once tried to explain it to me, but he left befoe i could right it down. If anybody responds to this, can you tell me how stamina affects the forms as well? Thanks</div></div><hr />

Cat: 2AP per strength + 1pt per agility or 2.4pts per strength + 1 pt per agility with heart of the wild<br />
All other forms: 2 pts per strength<br />
<br />
20 points of agility = 1% to crit and 40 armor (I forget the amount to dodge)<br />
<br />
14AP = 1dps<br />
<br />
Windsaber: tenacity is the Libram of Tenacity which gives you a 125 armor enchant to head or leg<br />
<br />
So the best bear trinket pair is definitely mark of tyrnary and smoking heart of the mountain.  If  you chose another trinket than the mark, you can use the uldaman trinket from the last boss... 50armor is better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also Falloraan when you petitioned a GM about the item swap under what petition heading did you apply and what was your reason (if you have to give one) ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">11-01-2006, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are feral with HotW, most people prefer strength, especially if it is straight AP (rather than feral AP) since rogues will get just as much benefit from straight AP while HotW gives druids 2.4 AP per point of str.  Its a scaling thing, if you want to try to do competive dps against rogues, ferals need much more AP than them, and generally HotW is how they do it.<br />
<br />
One of the big concerns for itemization in the expansion is so far we have seen many upgrades to +AP weapons, but not many with significantly higher str.<br />
<br />
If you do not have HotW, I don't suppose it makes a difference.</div></div><hr />

Can't remember what category I used, I think it was &quot;Quests&quot;. My reason for the item reimbursement was that when I originally completed the quest (which was before the first druid review), feral druids were not a viable build at the time so getting Blackhand's Breadth wasn't even a consideration. But after the druid review (1.8?) feral became viable and I re-specced, and wanted to trade in the reward I had chosen for the feral item. A couple days later a GM contacted me in game and told me they could do that for me, but they would only do a limited number of equipment restores and was I sure I wanted to use one for this blah blah blah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can resto in bear/cat form do decent dmg?<br />
<br />
thanks falloraan, i will give it a shot when i log on next.<br />
<br />
and soz to unendlich for high jacking the thread</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghortje</div><div class="date">11-02-2006, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">vhailor, it depends what your attack rating already is.<br />
If you have +1000 then i would go with agi to boost your crit rate, unless you are already at 25%crit:)<br />
resto can do dmg whith correct gear, but it will never match a full feral<br />
try to get a nice balance between str and agi</div></div><hr />
