<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 02:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest is obtained from the same NPC as the bear form quest - Mathrengyl Bearwalker in Darnassus, and can be started at level 14.  I'm going off memory for a lot of this, so please post corrections if you see something wrong.<br />
<br />
Things to be sure to get before starting the quest: 5 earthroot.<br />
<br />
Mathrengyl will send you to Moonglade to talk to Dendrite Starblaze.  Dendrite will then send you to Darkshore, to fill a bottle with water from the cave mouth above Cliffspring Falls.  There are level 16-17ish naga guarding this cave; you'll probably have to kill a few of them.<br />
<br />
After filling the bottle, go talk to Alanndarian Nightsong in Auberdine (she's in the northernmost building).  She will ask you to collect 5 earthroot and 12 lunar fungus.  Earthroot you should already have, hopefully.  The fungus is inside the same caves as the bear form quest, east of Auberdine; you'll probably have to go through 4-5 caves before you get enough fungus.<br />
<br />
Returning to Alanndarian, she will want you to apply the cure to the sickly deer in Darkshore.  As mentioned in the quest description, these are pretty much all over the zone, south of the river.  Roam around until you find them all.<br />
<br />
After curing 10 deer, teleport back to Moonglade, talk to Dendrite, then return to Darnassus for your new spell and a decent offhand item (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=15866)!</div></div><hr />

The fungus is in the moonkin caves though, one of which is the bear form cave.  They start just slightly east of Auberdine, and range south of it a little bit.</div></div><hr />

Same cave plus additonal similar ones as for bear quest.  Mushroom cave is much farther north past Bashal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">12-01-2004, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the water came from in front of the mushroom cave and it had mushrooms inside I was wondering. I did this last night and just did the Bearform cave for 3 cycles to get 12.   Was able to clear about a half dozen mobs around it between respawns so it went fast and another druid that needed bearform came in while I had it cleared so I helped him with the bearform mob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need herbalism to get the earthroot, which is why I was suggesting getting it before starting the quest; though this was from the perspective of leveling up in human lands, and stopping by the Ironforge AH before porting to Moonglade -- you can probably find someone willing to sell you a few by asking in General or Trade.  You don't need herbalism for the fungus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did /shout looking for 5 eathroot, pst and I got a response in about 10 seconds from someone who gave them to me for free.  They are tradeable.<br />
<br />
As for the Lunar Fungus, there are 2 or 3 Moonkin Caves all pretty close to each other you can pilfer 3-4 Lunar Fungus in each cave.  Just look around on the ground, they are somewhat smaller than the other mushroom caps in the cave.  When you loot it , it will give 1-2 fungus.  They disappear after you loot them so you can't keep going back to the same ones trying to get all 12.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I second this -- I got 3 of these just by running around and killing timberlings up near the north lake/river combo of Elfland. Not hard at all :)</div></div><hr />

That is a great item for the level when you get it.  If it was useable from inventory I'd still be carrying it at 52.  I guess it's not flagged in such a manner as it would be overpowering at the level when you get it.</div></div><hr />
