 <br />
Anyways I am considering getting the aa seondary recall, but I am not sure how it works excatly.  I know it requires a stone of marking, to mark an additional bind point and that when used it will gate you to that bind point and does not gate the group just the druid. <br />
 <br />
What i dont know is , do you have to remark the bind point each time, and how long of a cast is it? could it be used as an additional egress/instant evac?  I belive its on a 10 minute recast also, is that right?<br />
 <br />
I'd like to hear from people who have actually bought this aa and used it.<br />
 <br />
If it's a once every 10 min self only instant evac I'd really consider getting it.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't remember the cast time exactly, since I no longer play, but it was fairly long.  Maybe about the same as a gate spell.</div></div><hr />

Seems to be the actual gate spell just pointed to a different bind. When it fails you even get the standard gate collapsed message but your screwed for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
I think it's a great AA</div></div><hr />

Good AA for getting around quickly, I use it quite a bit myself.</div></div><hr />

I wish /charinfo would show where one's secondary binding is though same as primary.</div></div><hr />

I have my primary zone in tranq, and my secondary bind in the GL.  And I personally think the dang your portal has collapsed message shouldnt count for AAs.  That is my only complaint about the AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soloun</div><div class="date">06-03-2006, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very handy to go check the farm so to speak. I agree about the unstable gate messages, pita, last time that happened my ability timer said cannot reuse for 10mins, as if I had just used it successfully. Good ability overall imo, worth the AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wanderinglefty</div><div class="date">06-15-2006, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Broke down an got this aa, and like it.  I've been using it to go to a farm zone while freeing my normal style bind point for whatever.<br />
 <br />
Also it casts at what seems to be just a hair over 5 seconds for me, I did max the exodus aa so that could be a factor there, dunno.  From the other posts sounds like the cast is longer for some so I'm guessing thats why.  It did save me once when instant evac was down and I didnt have a succor/egress loaded.  <br />
 <br />
There's alot of other aa I'd reccomend over this one, but its good to have.</div></div><hr />

Gate to a safe spot (guild lobby, pok, tranq) and let DT hit then secondary right back  to the Vish instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dari</div><div class="date">06-15-2006, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't imagine leaving my group for as long as it would take me to gate, wait, gate back. I'm usually CC healer and that just wouldn't work. I've never had a problem finding a spirit though /hugs track <br />
Our rangers call out spirit location directions and call out when one is down, so we pretty much know. Then again there was that one time my SK partner beat me to MY mournful spirit and I had to find another fast! /rude partners! :hit:<br />
<br />
I did finally get this AA, but have yet to use it.</div></div><hr />

Alot of times we will have periods where there just aren't any up at all.  We also don't have any problems with healing.  We regularly have melee TL out to avoid a DT also</div></div><hr />

I believe this is an intentional design of the event.  The ability to manage the adds upon their death is part of the strategy to winning.</div></div><hr />
