As for myself, I'm looking forward to the level cap increase... and the content that goes with it.  I'm curious if they plan on slowing the leveling speed down from 60-70 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">12-12-2005, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea but it will trivialize some of the pre-expansion content that lvl 70's will just farm day and night now, just like every other game that had a lvl cap increase. How many lvl 70 characters you think it will take to clear MC/BWL after all is said and done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrigar</div><div class="date">12-12-2005, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a way it will be pretty cool, because of new skills and abilities, though it would be nice if they could work that in without a lvl cap increase.  For those of us that don't have time to run MC/BWL all the time now, by the time the expansion comes out, we've put a lot of effort to get our gear up to par with the people that do have time to raid them.  And then it will all be for nothing because we will have to start all over again.  And I agree with Jimmay, MC is already on farm status for guilds now, I can't imagine what its going to be like once there are lvl 70's and such.  I love this game, but I really don't understand Blizzards thought process in how the game is progressing.</div></div><hr />

The last thing I want to do is grind again. And unfortunately since I all I do is PvP, I have no choice but to do it. It may very well be the end of WoW for me.  <br />
<br />
I wish these MMORPGs would come up with a more original way of allowing players to further develop their characters without it being the tired &quot;raising the level cap&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">12-24-2005, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, which is a big contributer to the problem of a lot of people at the end game. Though still something to help with leveling up secondary characters would be nice, it gets really dull slogging through the same crap again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrax</div><div class="date">01-19-2006, 10:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally feel that it is a mistake.  Oh and hello after a long absence.  My reasons for this are that they aren't even finished doing talent rebalancing yet and they are ready to add 10 more levels worth of talents.  Heck, I know I'm probably alone in this, but I didn't like the way they redid the resto tree... now they plan on mucking up the trees even more. <br />
<br />
/shrug Their game and all but I hate when a game makes drastic changes over what it was released as, all within a year or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykuro</div><div class="date">01-20-2006, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmmm anyone think they would make the mobs in instances higher lvl aswell?<br />
<br />
MC and all the other high lvl dungeons will be lot easier if they dont</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ittles</div><div class="date">02-03-2006, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i just got the game on 1/21/06 and I love it so far.  I was reading about the new expansion coming out, and I really think that Blizzard is not releasing it to focus on raising the level cap to 70.  From what I read, the purpose of the patch is to broaden the horizons of gameplay and open up new and exciting gameplay features. <br />
<br />
For example, part of the expansion is being able to go back in time and fight the major battles of Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3 from a certain perspective on the battlefield.  (Different situations for different races is definately cool)  They are also adding in new areas to quest in and new items to get your hands on.  New enemies in those areas, as well as new enemies in familiar areas. <br />
<br />
And the last thing...WHO DOESN'T WANNA BE A FREAKIN BLOOD ELF (the new race that will be available with the expansion)  I know many of the level 60's might not like the fact that they would have to start over in order to have a blood elf alt, as well as trying to get to level 70 on their main, but all blizzard is trying to get you to do is be able to spend even more countless hours playing this wonderfully created game.  <br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents :)<br />
<br />
Another edit:  I saw many of you wondering about the end-game raids.  As for them, the expansion will be making those end-game raids a little easier and so that they can be completed with a lesser amount of people, but at the same time still challenging.</div></div><hr />

Other than that, I'm not over concerned one way or the other.  I do think it is pretty much a natural progression of games though.  Have been expecting it all along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-14-2006, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see no level cap at all but a geometric rate of increase to make the next level.<br />
<br />
There would be no arbitrary ceiling, but a natural max would emerge through the sheer time it would take to advance further.</div></div><hr />

Looks good, I'm gonna try and get at least 2 60s before expansion so I can raise them both to 70 :)</div></div><hr />
