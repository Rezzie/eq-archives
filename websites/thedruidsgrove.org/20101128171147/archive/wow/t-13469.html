<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-12-2009, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok finally after talking about it and having got a couple or so new members recently we're going to try a 10 man OS tonite !<br />
<br />
we dont quite have 10 people to do this.....we have more than 10 80's but with people having multi char getting 10 individual people with the right class makeup is not quite within our grasp.<br />
<br />
So we've had to get in a tank and healer from people i know really well.<br />
<br />
We have 7 guildies signed up - 1 tank and no healers !!<br />
<br />
So this means i'm going to be forced to heal and i've never ever been to OS.<br />
<br />
We still need to find a healer before we start tonite as well.  Unfortunately the only guild healer is currently working away during the weeks :(<br />
<br />
Everyone wants to DPS !  <br />
<br />
Atm i thnk we are looking at going with<br />
<br />
3 shammies signed up and all are dps and wont/cant heal. <br />
DK MT<br />
Pally OT<br />
2 mages<br />
1 druid - healing against his will<br />
1 priest - healer<br />
<br />
<br />
We actually have more dps in the guild who would come but signed up too late and so we have no spaces.  If it was non guild dps guild then i'd be letting the guild people have priority but its not :(<br />
<br />
The only good thing about me healing is i wont be forced to admit that i have next to no hit rating ! as its not needed for heroics.<br />
<br />
What level is the OS 10 boss? (just the one?) 82 elite or a ?? raid boss ?<br />
<br />
If i ever dps i will need to put on some hit stuff even if loses me spellpower/crit etc. cos if i cant hit anything spell and crit dont really matter do they ! :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to say that OS10 and OS25 are probably my favorite raids to heal- quick and painless =)<br />
<br />
As long as your group has either been there before or watched some video on the fight- you should be golden.  Good luck Khel!  Please post and let us know how it goes =)</div></div><hr />

No :)  Significantly under hit cap it should be your number one stat to stack. <br />
<br />
OS is pretty straightforward but a good raid to get to grips with working together in a 10 man.  2 healers should be enough if you're reasonably well geared from heroics/badge gear as long as people behave and get out of the swirling things and dodge the flame wall :D</div></div><hr />

OS is a nice, gentle way of breaking into raiding. Once you see the little nuances firsthand, it will be an easy runthrough, week in and week out... have fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
first time 1 shotted everything :buttrock: :biggrin: <br />
<br />
we had one silly wipe cos on 1 of the mini bosses we were talking tactics and a pat sneaked up on us and somehow we pulled the boss lol !<br />
<br />
other than that it was txt book !<br />
<br />
i had no idea what i was doing never having been there !<br />
<br />
i really should have got an achievement for completing my first ever raid since Original WoW !!<br />
<br />
cant say i enjoyed healing and for some reason i had max 10 fps the whole time which did not help :(<br />
<br />
still no idea how i avoided flame walls...followed the RL mainly !<br />
<br />
more 10 mans to come i hope !<br />
<br />
Eye ok for us i wonder....<br />
<br />
I managed to get the oomkin EoC helm last nite with its +60 hit which will really help me plus i'll have to use that Mark of the War Prisoner trinket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now go kick Malygos' ass!<br />
<br />
seroiusly though, EoE should be no problems as long as your group can figure out phase 3. Phase 3 is the group killer.</div></div><hr />

EoE is a blast too - three very different phases.  Go for it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Mag, i'm glad i'm providing a service and keeping the Grove a happy place with Happy Druids :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers skw/Raging - will hope to do it soon.<br />

Forgive the really n00b question.....is VoA and Eye the same thing ?  as someone said we should try VoA 10 man but said you cant really plan as because you can only do it when you control WG ????<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit : best place to find a really good tactics / video / map etc of where to flippin run to in order to avoid the flame wall things ?  is there some secret to it ?  do they come in a pattern and you simply need to remember it ?<br />
<br />
The first time it came i followed the RL and was ok, the next time i came i started to run to the same spot and saw the RL was not - then i got hit by the wall but seemed to be ok and did not take too much damage....after that i stuck like glue to the RL...so was probably healing from a little close to the boss ! :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Eye of Eternity is the immediate follow on from Naxx and is above Nexus. As long as one of your group has Downed Sapphiron and has the key/quest from that boss you can do EoE.<br />
<br />
VoA is an instance in the Fort doodah in Wintergrasp so you can only do it when your factions is in control of WG. Not run it for ages, but think there's now three bosses in there.<br />
<br />

It's pretty straight forward once you realise that there's only two gaps in the wall and hence only two areas that you need to learn to run to. If the wall spawns to the right of the boss then you need to stand more or less where the boss is.  If it spawns to the left of the boss you need to run away from the boss towards the top end of the island.<br />
<br />
Having someone call &quot;Left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; when the wall spawns and maybe putting a flare or two down to mark where you need to run to can be helpful for the first couple of runs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">08-14-2009, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh, and btw, get used to that 10 fps in OS... the fire and lava effects wreak havoc on *my* graphics card, and it sounds like its doing the same to yours. you may want to go to your interface options menu and dial spell effects and all other visual options down. it didn't make that much difference for me visually, but i went from lagging out to the occasional 3 fps, depending on where we are, and the size of the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-14-2009, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheers Nellie.<br />
<br />
I will look for and remember the 2 gaps for next week :)<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm great skw - i may have to down some settings cos 10fps or less sucks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-17-2009, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still only two bosses in VoA- As I understand it the 3rd boss will come sometime after some change with Arena (as it's a raid that drops pvp gear).  I was disappointed to go in and not be able to whoop on the Flame guy this weekend =(.<br />
<br />
The Tankspot video is decent for seeing the flame walls.  Being a healer in that raid, I don't even have to be facing my target to heal them- so I generally just turn to the sides a lot to see where the walls are.<br />
<br />
With Deadly Boss Mods- a big blue warning pops up dead center in my screen that says &quot;FLAME WALL&quot;.  When I see that, I turn to the left or right to see where the walls are coming from, then run to the gap.  It's easy to see the gap doing that too =)  <br />
<br />
Nellie hit it dead on.  There are only two &quot;safe places&quot; to run to and once you've done it a few times it becomes almost second nature.  <br />
<br />
And most importantly of all- Grats Khel!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-18-2009, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all. I will look out for fire coming from the left or the right tomorrow nite!!<br />
<br />
its so small and quick its a real shame that you can only do it once per week.  seems a bit stoopid tbh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eridalafar</div><div class="date">08-24-2009, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For raiding progression I may suggest this:<br />
<br />
OS/Naxx/earth boss in Voa are more or less on the same power level. The electic boss in VoA  then Uldar/EoE. The new ToC 10 players instance I can say for now as we didn't have done it to the end for now.<br />
<br />
A special note about VoA, your side (alliance or horde) need to be in control of wintergraps to be able to go in. And it may rarely be during the time you have sceduled for raiding with your guild depanding of your server.<br />

<br />
We've done a Naax 10 run - update in another thread.<br />
<br />
We;'ve talked about VoA but it was pointed out to me last week about needing to control WG which i did not know having never been to either WG or VoA !<br />
<br />
I will look into 10 man Uldaur - although i expect we may lack the gearing across the board to do this....</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first boss in Ulduar is doable without needing excellent kit and is good fun, after that you do really need a group that is pretty much decked out in T7/Naxx epics to make much progress in the place.  A lot of the fights are also more technical than what's in Naxx but if you're breezing past fights like Thaddius, Heigan, Sapph and Kel that require everyone to be switched on and move around or switch targets then it's a pretty good instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-10-2009, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">tbh Nel we are basically all in gear thats at least naax level i believe.<br />
<br />
with the changes to the badge system everyone is adding ilvl 226 gear to their kit in the past month.<br />
<br />
no doubt people will still have some ilvl 200 epics but with ToC H as well giving 219 gear i would be surprised if anyone is not averaging 213 across the board....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">09-11-2009, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then you're geared for the place, in theory at least and doing better than me, I got my first piece of gear out of ToC5 last night after however many runs it is and after a month of Ulduar I still haven't seen a bit of leather, let alone lost a roll on it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-11-2009, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah we did really blitz 10 man naax, basically without wipes until we got to Sapph and Kel.<br />
<br />
i use wow heroes and it now shows how people are geared for the various instances with red/yellow/green and most of us are at least yellow for running the likes of uldaur 10 and even 25 on normal modes.<br />
<br />
I am hoping for Uldaur 10 next Wednesday.<br />
<br />
tbh there is now nothing left for me to get from EoC's or ToC H for either oomkin or resto.<br />
<br />
I need EoT's for upgrades.<br />
<br />
I still have some ilvl 200 items...ring/trinket but mainly i have all 219 and 226 gear.</div></div><hr />
