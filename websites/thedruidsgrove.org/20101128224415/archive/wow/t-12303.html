Best part, it's craftable and BoE (I have the vortexes on Blackhand server now, if someone wants to buy one, horde side). <br />
<br />
My question is, How do you gem it?<br />
<br />
Emmerald's website encourages doube +12 stam gems. I've been using 4 agi/6 stam gems to get the 4 stam socket bonus. I've seen one or two druids using the 8 agi gems to maximize their crit and dodge.<br />
<br />
Where do you weigh in? Max Dodge? Max Stamina? Split the difference (like me)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going straight Stamina. My Dodge/Armor/Crit are fine in my tank set.....but I can always use more HP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-07-2008, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first, I gemmed two Shifting Nightseyes (4 Agility/6 Stamina), as I needed more of a balance at the time. But later on, as I was using it for DPS, and it was easier, I put two Delicate Living Rubies (8 Agility) in the belt, and replaced all the Shifting Nightseyes in my Malorne Chest with Solid Star of Elune (12 Stamina).<br />
<br />
Granted, a few weeks later I got the Belt of Deep Shadow. But still. I'd say gem from whichever of the two stats you need, be it agility, stamina, or a mix. If you're armor capped I'd consider the Belt of the Great Beast, or whichever, due to the hit rating.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what are the stats on the belt and mats? (cannot access any wow type sites via a firewall ;))<br />
<br />
i'll have to see if anyone can craft it on my server if i can get the mats which are probably quite difficult / expensive if its as a good a belt as it seems to be.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they can, AppleJax. I am at 29k and a friend of mine is at 31k. The 5k she is missing are doable. <br />
<br />
I'd probably be able to do it myself with stuff from my bank and a few evenings of farming for high-AC items, but I would lose a lot sta and agi for it.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure a few of us here are at the armor cap. All you need are around 6.8 AC on your equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats:<br />
<br />
423 Armor<br />
20 Agility<br />
38 Stamina<br />
29 Strength<br />
12 Intellect<br />
Red Slot <br />
Red Slot<br />
(+4 stamina from socket bonus).<br />
<br />
The mats aren't too bad, just the vortex is expensive. With two purple gems (what I'm sticking with for right now), it's got 28 agility, 54 stamina (oh yah, baby) and 423 armor. <br />
<br />
That compares favorably to the belt of the great beast, which provides:<br />
367 armor<br />
28 agility<br />
30 stamina<br />
29 strength<br />
18 to-hit<br />
red slot (assume agi/stam)<br />
blue slot (assume stam)<br />
<br />
For a total of 367 armor (56 less), 32 agility (4 more), 48 stamina (6 less) and 18 to hit (as opposed to intellect). The Waistgaurd of the great beast (purchased with heroic badges) is very good, just not as good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put it this way. I believe I had 7.5kish armor in caster form and wasn't capped. I left off with 4/5 T5, two armor trinkets, 2 armor rings, Belt of Natural Power, Vambraces of Ending, 1 Piece of T4, Wildfury, and Boots of Natural Grace. Had I gotten the Bands of the Swift Paw and that last piece of T5, I still wouldn't have been armor capped. Close, but not exactly.<br />
<br />
You won't see an armor cap until you're in BT gear. Or get Ancestral Fortitude, etc. But I don't rely on that.</div></div><hr />

I am not ashamed to say I tank in BT/Hyjal in T4 still. It's not ideal, but my luck with getting T5 was, shall we say, limited. (yes, every time we kill anything, &quot;Champion&quot; drops)<br />
<br />
And even in Hyjal/BT, you have to remember that all the T6 is from the last bosses. The last 3 in Black temple in the last two in Hyjal.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, armor-wise, you won't want to put on T5 until you have many more pieces. Had I not received MT priority, I probably wouldn't have bothered as much with T5 myself, letting others get it first.<br />
<br />
But, that said, the stamina, agility, and, in the case of the pants, hit rating that you gain are all very good and add up.<br />
<br />
Soo. It's an upgrade. You just need more pieces for it to be worth it. Odd, but oh well.<br />
<br />
Funny how strong our T4 bonuses are, isn't it?</div></div><hr />
