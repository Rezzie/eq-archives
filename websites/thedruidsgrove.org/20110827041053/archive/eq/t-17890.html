I read that Cazic no longer exists. Do I automatically get put into another server? If not, what server did Cazic combine with?<br />
How many servers are left? I didn't realize how much the population was declining. It is scarry to see a lame game like WoW keep expanding.</div></div><hr />

If you have your old login/password, you should still see your characters on the selection screen and it'll tell you what server they are on now.<br />

If you find out, let me know - I used to be on Cazic too :)</div></div><hr />

The game was so fresh and new. The community on Cazic was just a lot of fun. I know it will never exist again, it is like bringing back the 1950's, 60's or 70's, etc.<br />
But we had so much fun exploring and just hanging out in game. I used to logon at 2pm on a saturday and log off 15 hours later. Me and my gf used to eat at our computers.<br />
RL dominates now.....but  &quot;Those were the days&quot; :)<br />
Remember &quot;Tumpy Tonics&quot;, that little secret quest where folks could get from level 1 to 30 without killing a creature. Rubicite armor, the original J-boots before they were quested...........the chills up your spine entering Befallen.<br />
One could go on and on.</div></div><hr />
