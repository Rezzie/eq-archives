<br />
Another suggestion is to go to thott, grab some easy quests in your area that yield good exp.  When questing, I typically leave thott up and running so I can pop back and forth if I have never doen that quest before.  2 me, it makes questing faster. Hopefully your rest exp will also make a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get more xp/kill because of rested, but also because you are lower level than the group.  A low level gets more xp for a particular mob than a high level, simple as that.<br />
<br />
You just have to get in range again.  Possibly ask them to take a short break or start up some alts while you catch up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of soloable quests there, so you'll get XP fast.  Try to do a suicide run to Booty Bay (or just ask a lvl 40 to escort you), so that you can get the Flight Path there.  Otherwise, you constantly have to fly to Duskwood and then run to STV. (When you get Travel Form, it's not a bad run from Darkshire, but still.)<br />
<br />
As a druid, you'll spend most of your time in Bear or Cat form, as you smack down those tigers, panthers and apes. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

Im just worried because i did just about all quests i can find, and Im running out, im only about half way to my lvl, and apparently only one or two friends are usually on doing a dungeon i ususally cant do, because im 2 low of lvl. GOD! I THINK THIS IS A WORST CASE SCENERIO! I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING!!!<br />

And there's a lot of quests there<br />
<br />
Also if you are not full feral spec. I would spec to full feral so you can go bear and take higher mobs downs. Also if you can have the best gear for your lvl so taking down higher lvl mobs is easy!<br />
Feral spec wants Strength and stam (bear), cat= agil.<br />
Also if you can get some enchants cheap or free that helps taking down higher lvl mobs.<br />
<br />
I loved STV way back when I was leveling, I know other people hated that place.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurg</div><div class="date">08-09-2006, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talk to your friends, since they seem to have quite a bit more play time then you ask them if they wouldnt mind working on other toons while you are not on and saving the ones you normally play for when you are, I have a couple alts parked at different levels for just that reason (friends who cant play much)<br />
<br />
Also remember that though you might be able to take down that mob who is 4 or so levels over you it takes alot longer then were you to take down mobs who are 1 over to 1 under and yeah he will give you more xp for that one kill it will work out that most times in the time it takes to kill that one big mob you could have killed 2 or 3 of the little ones with alot less time to recover from the kill and move on (healing, drinking or god forbid a CR) <br />
<br />
Dont stress about your gear.. use what falls untill you hit around 50 and then really start focusing your search for the type of gear you are needing (Feral/Balance/Healing) STAY AWAY FROM THE AH!! the temptation will be there to get your stats up young but remember that BP you just spent 1 gold on will be useless in 3-4 levels and you wont get nearly that from the vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not expand your horizons and do instances at your level with PuGs?  I know that it can be hit-and-miss getting a good group but you will no doubt find some good players that you work well with.  Add them to your friends list and, lo, you've got some more players at your level that you can quest with!<br />

<br />
<br />
Another added benefit, is that you get experience working in groups, so that you can learn the do's and don't's.  At level 50, I still find atrocious PuG's and it seems like some players just solo 'til 50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Up to level 30-35ish bear seems more reliable than cat, being as gimped as it is. Once you get some talents for cat, you should start leveling with cat.<br />
<br />
The great thing is feral druids have relatively little downtime. You buff yourself, go cat/bear, fight the mob, shift out heal, shift in and go again. The mana regen is enough to keep you healed while you fight.<br />
<br />
When I was leveling, I never got to play everyday unlike my mage and warrior friend, but once I got to about level 30ish, I literally blasted past them. I hit 60 1 and a half weeks before they did.</div></div><hr />

Both of the Razorfen Instances also have some good leather pieces.</div></div><hr />
