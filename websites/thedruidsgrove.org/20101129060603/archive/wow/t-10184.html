<br />
At first I thought I was seeing things, but again it came up &quot;Darnassus is under attack!&quot;<br />
<br />
I did a quick /who and found not too many high lvls in the area and mounted up and ran over the warrior terrace.  <br />
<br />
I see an ancient laying dead and about 15 - 20 horde ranging from high 40s to 60.<br />
<br />
There are the lvl 55 guards, but they were getting slaughtered as quickly as they were spawning.  Only being a lvl 52 I knew the 60s would kick my druid arse, but I figured I gotta help.  I was able to drop a 54 and 52 before 3 ganged up on me and took me out.  By that time more people had shown up the more and more guards were spawning.  <br />
<br />
We were able to drive them back out of Darnassus and eventually all the way back to the starting grounds and then finally the stopped coming.  <br />
<br />
It was great fun, but I NEVER expected to see a raid against Darnassus.  I guess my question is how the hell did they get there to begin with??</div></div><hr />

<br />
A zerg from the boat through the fishing village into the city would work, but would likely draw a lot of attention before you got there (just getting on the boat in Auberdine would pose its own challenges).<br />
<br />
I suppose if you could just sneak a few warlocks in to Teldrassil proper you could summon a force outside the city and attack from there.  Do they need a shard for each summon or just mana?<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

We don't know if the channels were going off.  They could have been.<br />

You can be quick.<br />

Even if you die you can rez on the boat when it comes assuming your corpse is close enough.<br />

<br />
The only way I can think of would be working at least one warlock in and some stealths to help with the summonings.  If it was planned well ahead of time they could have worked him in a day or two before the actual raid, even with multiple corpse walks.<br />
<br />
Maybe they were abusing invisibility pots or gnomish cloaking devices?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I saw the &quot;Darnassus is under attack&quot; the repeated message was very shortly after that.  Being at the auction house I wasn't far from Warriors Terrace.  <br />
<br />
Had they gone through Warriors Terrace they would have aggro'd the Sentinels there.  When I first came up the ones on the terrace had yet to be pulled into the fight until the pack pushed forward while battling Alliance members that came to defend Darnassus ( me included ).<br />
<br />
Also, I saw some horde riding up from that ( the non Rutheran Village ) side.  I can't say for sure that's where they initially came from or what, but based on what I saw, that's my best guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-13-2006, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an update. <br />
<br />
Seems there is a rock next to the dock in Auberdine that can be easily climbed ( to avoid guards ) and then jump onto the dock and take the boat.  <br />
<br />
From there I'm not sure how they all got to the other side of Darnassus.</div></div><hr />

Not many people would see you from Auberdine unless they were really looking. Once there, run to the central tree/bank, hang a left to the Cenarion Enclave, then a right through the crafter's quarters and you're behind the warriors terrace.</div></div><hr />

I figure if the damn alliance can sweep in and wreak havoc, then we (horde) should be able to do the same to one of their capitals!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its the slaughtering Auberdine that would generate the chatter.  Darkshore is a pretty busy place, somebody would alert darnassus.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking they snuck in a lock with a couple of stealth classes (maybe using potions), and once in Teldrassil he summoned the rest of the raid, including more locks to speed up the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadë</div><div class="date">03-16-2006, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But that's what I'm saying, you wouldn't have to slaughter Auberdine, just run across from one boat to the other, and there have been many a time that I've seen the docks at Auberdine empty. So, the most uproar that a raid would get in that zone is a &quot;The Dark Shore is under attack&quot; message as they cleared the dock guards before hitting Darnassus.<br />
The slaughtering at Menethil wouldn't generate a blip on the Darnassus folks radar unless they are listening to World Defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-16-2006, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I see what you're saying now.  I still think a big raid on an unusual town like that would generate a lot of chatter on the whole alliance side, especially with the linked chat in the cities now.  When you don't show up in Theramore they would know where you went/ were heading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonferal</div><div class="date">03-22-2006, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While playing my Orc Warlock, at approximately lvl 55 I got through Darnassus to the zone on the other side, wasn't much of a problem.  Forgot how I got to boat, think it was like the previous post said, there is a rock that allowed me up on dock without allerting any guards.  I got off the boat, mounted up and ran to the portal to Darnassus.  After that I just ran through the city to freedom on the other side, took alot of damage, certainly could have died but I made it.<br />
<br />
Later I came back through and I was able to walk around in an area on one side of the city without any problem, might have gotten some guard agro on the way in, but once I was far enough in he turned back.  Area I was in was sort of behind the druid tree area, but not directly behind it.<br />
<br />
So with some planning a warlock and some rogues could bring in a force not outside the gates but actually inside of the city.  From there it would be easy to plan on night elf burgers for dinner.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agonistes</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was bored and did this once with a level 7 orc rogue.<br />
<br />
I made the orc a rogue because I wanted to be able to stealth.  I never played a rogue before, and this is the only one I have ever tried.<br />
<br />
I got him to level 7 and made the best gear I could for him with my other characters using LW, blacksmithing and enchanting.  I loaded him down with food, potions and bandages and then started out.<br />
<br />
I ran all the way to the town the docks are in (I forgot the name), dying maybe a dozen times on the way.  Once I got there, I approached the town from the north side, where the hills are.  I lept down behind the buildings and ran for the docks.<br />
<br />
I made it into the dock building area before dying.  I then came back and ran down the docks as far as I could as a ghost and rezzed.  I kept up this leapfrog pattern until I got to the end of the docks.  <br />
<br />
Then, when the boat came in, I got on it as a ghost and made sure it was empty, then I rezzed on the upper deck by the wheel.  The boat took off.  I thought it was so kick ass that I had pulled it off.<br />
<br />
Until I found out I was on the wrong boat.<br />
<br />
So I had to wait it out and ride the boat back to the docks then do the dying leap-frog move to the other side of the docks.<br />
<br />
When I got to the island, I jumped off the boat and swam up the shore.  I ran around and made it into the teleporter before dying.<br />
<br />
It took me several more deaths to get through Darnassus and all the way to the NE starting point, but once I did, it was a blast.  I don't know what the elves were saying, but they seemed shocked out of their minds to see an orc running around that spider cave with them.</div></div><hr />

Darnassus is in alliance territory therefore you cannot be attacked unless you turn your flag on. So don't attack them they can't attack you.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but as soon as you enter any opposing faction's major city, you automatically get flagged...and even if you weren't flagged that doesn't stop the guards from attacking you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, it's pretty sad actually.  Horde have made it into Darnassus on 2 occasions I can recall.  They seem to really like taking out the guardian trees first.  I must say though, full kudos to the ones who make it in. It always shakes stuff up to see an opposite faction in a place you thought you were perfectly safe.  Even when they can't attack you.</div></div><hr />

Didn't go as well as planned, got knocked off my horse as soon as I entered the city, still I made it to right past the Warrior Terrace before they managed to take me down.<br />
<br />
The graveyard you go to  is near Dolanaar.<br />
<br />
Made my way back to my corpse and rezzed.  Had no problem running around in the city for about an hour, mostly back behind the craftmans terrace and cenarion enclave.  Took down a couple of the ancients and an occasional player who attacked me.<br />
<br />
I expected to be mobbed not long after I got there by alliance players but it never happened.  I was seem by many people at different times during my trip; on the docks trying to catch to boat to darnassus, on the dock after getting off the boat, many saw me run through town, couple saw me after I rezzed when I was wallking through tradesman terrace.  Nobody really ever came.  A lvl 60 dwarf, I'm guessing warrior, but could have been paladin, saw me close to the end of my fight with the ancient of war and decided (somewhat cowardly in my opinion) to attack me while I was at about 5% health and had a few npc's on me.  Guess he did save the ancients life but I really don't think he cared about that, just got himself some easy honor.<br />
<br />
Guess my point to all this is that it's not too hard to set up camp inside Darnassus and cause some mischeif.  It's not too difficult to get yourself there, if you arent' in the central part of the city the guards there don't ever bother you, and from what I can tell many alliance chars don't care that you are invading their city, I had many a night elf wave to me, a couple ladies even danced with me (woot!!).  About the only PC that attacked me did so when I was about dead (kudos to the lvl 20 who attacked me a couple times, he had no chance but had to like his commitment to defending his city)</div></div><hr />

We hopped the boat to NEland. Getting on the boat was an adventure because we tagged a guard and the elves came out of the woodwork but with some careful timing and all we were able to get on the boat and across to the other side. Once over to the other side it was a mad dash to the portal then another from the portal out of the city. 99% of our harrassment came from the guards while we were wandering around but once and a while a NE would pounce us (for like a second) then i set up camp outside one of the lowbie areas and thought it would be fun to raise a ruckus on the world defence so i started popin off guards, my mage friend stayed unflagged but would reflag if some action came our way. Never really happened though we did get one hunter who came and pestered us for a little bit. I couldnt help but laugh at the lvl 6 to 8s that kept on attacking me it was crazy now i was being nice and even if they flagged i wouldnt touch them unless they actually caused me damage and then one whap over the head with my tursty staff of elf bashin and it was curtans. This one druid i cant remember her name but she was a determined little elfer must have attacked me 20 or 30 times and got to the point where she made a new toon named Nurgsucks it was kinda cute. I cant wait untill my Moocow is old enough to survive the inital run threw Darnassis that was one of the most exciting days i have had in a long time. Never knew if over the next hill a group of alliance was going to come to the rescue of thier poor town<br />
