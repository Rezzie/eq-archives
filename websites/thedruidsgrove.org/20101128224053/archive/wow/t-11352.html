<br />
Also, being a 12 second DoT, does it only receive +80% spell damage? :physics:<br />
<br />
Edit: Doh, forgot to ask about Wrath - being a 2 second cast time, it only receives +57% spell damage right? (2/3.5)<br />
Moonfire, being an instant and DoT combo, how does the +spell damage spread out over it? 50% initial damage and 50% dot? Of +spell damage, it receives a small portion because it is instant, but how much?<br />
<br />
The reason why I ask is because I am thinking long and hard about a balance/resto build. Good nuke abilities with swiftmend = ownage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll tell you one thing...Survivability w/ the 0/41/10 build is terrible. I miss resto PvP (swiftmend and NS where are you~)</div></div><hr />

<br />
    *  The talent &quot;Swiftmend&quot; will now include bonus healing from the talents &quot;Improved Rejuvenation&quot; and &quot;Empowered Rejuvenation&quot;.<br />
    * &quot;Omen of Clarity's&quot; duration has been increased to 30 min.</div></div><hr />

It appears bugged, the bonus to stats dont apply when cast, yet the spell description notes the increase from the standard MoTW.<br />
<br />
Has this talent always been bugged, or is it only since the lastest patch? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arestavo</div><div class="date">12-10-2006, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vhailor, the easiest way to see if your Imp. MoTW is there is to check your resistances. Rank 7 (or GoTW rank 2) Imp. MoTW should give you +27 to each spell resistance category.<br />
<br />
This has been a known bug for the spell description since time before time, if I am not mistaken ;-)</div></div><hr />

Bloody WOW owes me a respec. grrr</div></div><hr />
