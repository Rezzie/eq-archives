I plan on playing on the test server because I don't have the time I once did and the double xp appeals to me.  I played an sk to 70, necro to 59, and a bst to 56.  I was thinking of rolling a druid, but wanted to know how well they solo.  I know druids are good in groups, but grouping won't always be possible for me.  I know that the necro is king of soloing single mobs, but how does a druid stack up against a necros soloing ability by kiting or charm killing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
my main is a 76 druid with 1200 AA. I also have an 68 necro with 100 AA.<br />
Here is how I see them:<br />
<br />
Druid: <br />
- versatile<br />
- ports are very nice (but not as necessary after POK, GH, potions)<br />
- FOE is nice, but modern mobs are often faster<br />
- OK at root/rotting<br />
- Quadding possible with good gear, but not very time efficient<br />
- Charming is the best exp out there solo, but restricted to animals<br />
- ok buffs, but mostly can be substituted by potions now<br />
- Great Powerlevelers<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Necroes:<br />
- pets are weak - ok<br />
- incredible dots<br />
- nice selfhealing<br />
- not equipment dependent at all (unless summoners)<br />
- best kiters<br />
- pretty good groupers<br />
- FD still great pulling tool<br />
- probably best exp/time of any class<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
Druid: <br />
Solo: Good to very good<br />
Group: Rarely wanted, ok sec. healer, lousy DPS<br />
Raid: 1 is enough for debuffs, low desirebility<br />
<br />
Necro:<br />
Solo: Gods<br />
Group: Always wanted<br />
Raids: Always wanted<br />
<br />
If you do nothing but solo, a charm killing druid can equal a necroes killing/exp rate. This is very situational however. Druids need to med more, necroes can kill constantly.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Enjoy EQ again - especially with the new AA exp system, which is in my mind the best change to happen to EQ for years:<br />
