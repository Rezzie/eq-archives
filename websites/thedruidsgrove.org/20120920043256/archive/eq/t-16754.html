Gotta say I'm a little dissapointed, I don't seem to crit my heals much. I have Fury of Magic 7 and I think I crit nukes WAY more, and by my math I should technically crit heal more... Granted I probably cast more nuke spells than heals but still.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, it isn't as though I regret getting them, they are important aa's and I will feel more of the full benefit the more of them I get. I was wondering though... Can our complete heal's crit?? I don't think I've seen mien crit even ONCE... Is it just me having bad luck or do they not crit?? I know Healing Adept affects our complete heals so I don't know why Healign Gift wouldn't...</div></div><hr />

Owell, still a nice spell til i get either a significantly better quick heal or just more healing gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drakrin</div><div class="date">06-27-2008, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes they can....  why I was upset and disappointed ours didn't.. even with gear up to such and such level doesn't make a difference in how much it heals for you still stuck in the around 5k range of that spell.  better to just use the fast heals then that spell for sure.  If your tank is taking a bit of damage.</div></div><hr />

Druid complete heal wasn't THAT far behind cleric's, this totally tips it out of balance though... Ours already takes more mana for less hp, and not letting us crit it? Maxed healing adept our cheal is only barely over 6k, if it COULD crit that would put it at 12k. I know clr cheal crits for nearly 20k.<br />
 <br />
I say if cleric complete heals can crit and ours cant, let item heal foci affect our complete heal.</div></div><hr />

Our CH doesn't &quot;crit&quot; because clerics would whine (And probally shammy).<br />
 <br />
Our nukes can't be improved because Mages would whine (And the developers).<br />
 <br />
Our DoT's wont be improved because Necro's would whine (Probally not but I couldn't help myself).<br />
 <br />
Well in all honesty the class was supposed to be a utility class that was 2nd at everything and best at nothing.  Thats both the blessing and curse of the class :banghead_ .<br />
 <br />
Although I don't know how helpful a CH crit would be in expansions where Tanks can die in less than 10 sec's.  Even the few cleric's I see who use CH often &quot;pad&quot; it with a HoT so the Tank can make it the full 10 Sec's.  Druid's really don't have that ability on a regular basis.  And with Tanks getting to be 20k + Buffed, I doubt a possible 12k heal every 10 sec's would make a huge difference.  You would probally be better off going 2-3 &quot;fast&quot; heals and not risking the tank taking a dirt nap.</div></div><hr />
