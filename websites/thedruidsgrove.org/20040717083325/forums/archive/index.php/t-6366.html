Think Talyena is right, you are talking about the ones that kept appearing, and then dissapearing, but eventually captured him and he later escaped via the wine casks?  Or am I thinking of the right book?</div></div><hr />

Yes, you have the correct book.</div></div><hr />

Bilbos party passed through Mirkwood.</div></div><hr />

And the wood elves call the forest they live in &quot;Greenwood&quot; I believe.  However, Greenwood and Mirkwood forest are one and the same.  It became known as Mirkwood when the 2nd of the Nazgul, &quot;The dragon Lord&quot; set up a stronghold in the southern portion of the forest in an age past.  The wood elves presence is primarily concentrated in the northern portion.  The portion closer to the lonely mountain. :)  It is this presence that has brought about the &quot;evilness&quot; in the forest in &quot;the hobbit&quot; as there are rumors of the dragon lord returning to his old stronghold.  I believe Gandalf refers obliquely to this fact when he says something about a dark shadow moving again in the forest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye.  No Dark Elves whatsover in any Tolkien work.<br />
<br />
I think R.A. Salvatore introduced what we have come to know as &quot;Dark Elves&quot; with the Drow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alyn cross</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">didn't the dragonlance novels by weis and hickman have 'dark elves' of a sort? perhaps they were not the original concievers, but i think their books contained dark elves before salvatore was writing... i could be wrong, though... god that was almost 20 years ago... =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoak</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tolkien does refer to Dark Elves in the Silmarillion.<br />
<br />
Can't remember the specifics, but the gist of it is that they didn't want to go into the light of the two trees since they were close to the stars.<br />
<br />
They were few in number, hard to find, and I think they were vaguelly sinister.<br />
<br />
May have been some hints that these were the elves that were corrupted to become the original orcs...but that is just speculation on my part...I haven't read the silmarillion in years and years...<br />
<br />
And they may have been called night elves or something.<br />
<br />
But yes, there were something dark-elf-like mentioned in the larger body of Tolkien's works, albeit not in the LOTR or Hobbit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dragonlance introduced two races that were pseudo-darkelvish (at least in looks):<br />
<br />
Dragonlance: The Dargonesti (The Lost Histories #3), Vol. 3<br />
Dragonlance: The Irda (Lost Histories #2), Vol. 2<br />
<br />
But both of these works were after Salvatore introduced us to the Drow... gads... a loooong time before.  I seem to recall an article not too long ago in which Salvatore was bestowed as the father of the Dark Elves  and was even asked how he felt about Verant using their likeness in EQ.  Damned if I can't remember what he replied.<br />
<br />
Ah, and Oldoak... yea, they were Night Elves.  They were sinister and did kept to the darkness but were in no way Dark Elf in appearance save the *presumed* pointed ears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alyn cross</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah, here we go.<br />
<br />
i knew i had heard of drow before i had read anything of salvatore, and here is the earliest mention of them i can find, withing the ad&amp;d realm (other works of fiction notwithstanding... i never read the dragonlance histories, but do remember some mention of dark elves in the books i did read as well...)<br />
<br />
so when you first went out and got the ad&amp;d players handbook and the dmg, and he picked up his copy of the monster manual, and whatnot, the old books.. i'm talking like old stuff... you might remember there was a series of modules you could buy that was referred to as the 'D' adventures or modules.  i think there were four in a row... might have been 3....  its been a long-assed time... anyway, they took place after the Giants modules.<br />
<br />
when you get to the end of the epic, your characters discover the drow, and in said module, at the back like they all had, was new monster manual pages for new critters appearing in said module... and there, in the last of the giants modules were the Drow...<br />
<br />
Valut of the Drow, the last of the adventures in the series was penned by Gary Gygax (originator of D&amp;D, iirc) in 1978.<br />
<br />
in researching this, i've found that i've forgotten why the hell i had even started researching it, as it has nothing to do with the wood elves in the Hobbit.<br />
<br />
So we are now There and Back Again, off track and back on.  wood elves.  drow born in 1978.  wood elves.<br />
<br />
it all makes sense, neh?<br />

<br />
In later days, Elwë became a king renowned. The Elves in his kingdom were the Eldar of Beleriand; the SINDAR they were named, the Grey-elves, the Elves of the Twilight. King Greymantle was he, Elu Thingol in the tongue of the Sindar. Melian was his Queen, wise and beautiful. They dwelt in hidden halls in MENEGROTH, the Thousand Caves, in Doriath. Great power Melian lent to Thingol, who was himself great among the Eldar; for he alone of all the Sindar had seen with his own eyes the Trees in the day of their flowering. Although Thingol was now King of the Úmanyar (the Dark Elves who have not seen the Two Trees), he was not considered one of the Moriquendi (Elves of Darkness), but he is numbered with the Elves of the Light and was mighty upon Middle-earth. From the love of Thingol and Melian came into the world the fairest of all the children of Ilúvatar that was, or shall ever be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think the guy might have digested it, but that is the reference I was remembering.  Again, not evil...just didn't see the trees...<br />
<br />
Still, I think there is one of their number in one of the later books who is portrayed in a sinister way...I just can't remember it well enough to find a reference to it/him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow... it's amazing but I just KNEW I had read about dark elves in Tolkien.  I did read part of the Similawhatchmacallit, but found it rather tough going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoak</div><div class="date">01-28-2004, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah but Alyn Cros is correct...the EQ vision of the Dark Elf (the one we know from many games) is really D&amp;D fare, and those drow games go back a long ways ; ).<br />
<br />
In Tolkien, the &quot;elves of darkness&quot; were, hmm, weaker elves if you will. They refused to go to Valinor...they clung to the lands of Middle Earth and stayed in the darkness...and they were not as powerful as a result.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">01-29-2004, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder why the hell Salvatore was dubbed the &quot;Father of the Dark Elves&quot; then.  Hmmm  Maybe because the bulk of his work pertains to them?  Oh well.<br />
<br />
Good work on digging up the quote Oldoak.  I stand corrected.  Those darn Dark Elves are just so much fun to discuss.   :vampire:</div></div><hr />
