<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-11-2009, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Small patches are nice in my opinion.  I would rather have 10 small patches than one big one....just seems to be less downtime and major errors/glitches when blizz only has to worry about a few changes at a time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
they always end up with servers needing rebooting, peolpe unable to login etc<br />

I think u can never test all possibilities on test-realms when dealing with software.<br />
The realtime servers are always a different story.<br />
I'm a software-developer myself, so i know with which problems blizzard deals (maybe not in the same size :wink: ).<br />
<br />
Even with the smallest patch, there can go million things wrong.</div></div><hr />
