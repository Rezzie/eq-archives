<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arkturus D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got Dire Charm last night and was wondering which zone (DSP, ML, or SD) was the best to hunt flawless rockhopper hides.  Any info much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunechantante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">heard that marus seru was great for it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Matafleur Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dawnshroud Peaks is a great place to farm hides. There is a set of caves which is home to some rockhoppers and a tribe of Gorangas. The Rockhoppers drop plenty of hides and there are a lot of mobs too.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the Tailoring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I found DSP to be the easiest place to hunt them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mares Seru only has greyhopper hides, no superb or flawless. Mons Letalis has superb and flawless, but it's not easy hunting. Most folks hunt them in DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arkturus D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are some real a-holes on my server that will despawn hoppers on purpose just to halt someones tailoring progress or force them to buy their hides in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sudawilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DSP,  i spent a lot of time farming there...   Its sad,  you cant DC the PH that will despawn the hoppers tho,  so i suggest camping the inner caves and working your way out,  its easier to control ppl trying to &quot;change&quot; to the sambata's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've dire charmed the placeholder before...it's the one on top of the mound, right?  I'm pretty sure that's where I've seen the age old rockhopper spawn.<br />
<br />
In any case, with dire charm and being non-kos to the shik`nar, I found mons letalis to be just as easy as dawnshroud.  The trick is to use sense animals, it'll always point you towards the nearest rockhopper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Apocalypse Criterion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally DSP, in the left cave at the bottom where the cheif goranaga spawns (who is an erudite wtf) - when hoppers are up there is often a very large hopper in there that cannot be snared but can be DC'd.  Charm it, Haste it, rest of the buffs, it will rip through everything in there, 4 hoppers on it at once and it will destroy them ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Mons Letalis is a decent option (Mature Rockhoppers) but is slightly slower due to loads of stonegrabber adds.  Make sure you give your DC pet SoE so it can keep up with you, although you'll still have to wait for it due to the terrain.<br />
