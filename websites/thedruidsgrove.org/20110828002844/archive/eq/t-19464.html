lots have changed!  I hunted with the mercenary<br />
and they seem to help alot.  Where would you<br />
recommend hunting now?   I am working on aa's now<br />
before leveling.  3 to4 a session now.  Crazy fast<br />
<br />
are there any others just coming back? <br />
At least there is little competition on zones now <br />

Also, 65-75 I would recommend splitpaw. Icefall Glacier should also be a good spot to charm solo.  Just for kicks take the warrior merc to nadox, charm an exhausted bloodtusk and just go crazy on a crazy massacre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigskyn</div><div class="date">09-03-2009, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome back!  I came back about a month ago after a 5 year hiatus.  The change in AA's xp is amazing. I remember having to spend a full night in serious grind groups to get one or two. Now I can get 5+ an hour. <br />
<br />
I dusted off my old warrior as well, transferred him to another account, got him to 65 (from 57) and have been plugging away at aa's on both while boxing with a tank and healer merc. Druid has gained almost 200 aa's and the warrior about 150.<br />
<br />
Coming back has been kind of overwhelming. So much new content and so much missed. I finally gave up trying to absorb it all and have decided to work on my Valdeholm faction while killing stuff in the Iceroot Falls (70 hot zone).  <br />
<br />
I'm going to make the leap to 71/72 here this xp bonus weekend (or collapse trying lol) to get to the new charm and new gear i've stocked up for the level. Then its another grind to get at least another few hundred AA.<br />
<br />
In any case, the zones (at least on AB) are fairly sparse. Not lots of competition like back in the day. Folks are still generally courteous and helpful.  I might also suggest that you pick up the 'gate' aa and bind yourself next to the emissary in PoK to get access to the plane of time/void stuff for when higher level groups announce that items are rotting.  At 65 (with innate camo aa) you can go a lot of places to pick up rotting augs and gear quickly to help you prep for the 80+ transition.<br />
<br />
Also, don't forget about the LoN (legends of norrath) game. You'll see it as a link on your 'eq' interface buttons. You can pick up a familiar that'll help you with your mana pool and/or regen. Lots of different choices there. It only makes me sad that you can't be in illusion form and on a mount at the same time :-(<br />
<br />
Anywho, enjoy the return. I smack myself for not keeping up with the game over the years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely agree with this... there's so much new stuff it's hard to even figure out how much new stuff there is :)<br />
<br />
I went to Firiona Vie the other night, and was surprised to find Cliff Golems guarding the bridge.  They ran the settlers off!?!  OMG!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I found them pretty quick - but it just surprised me to be running up to the bridge and see those 2 golems there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">09-04-2009, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, that was a fun event.  I got into a bit of trouble though when I exploit killed the hatesfury dracoliche, one of the horseman, almost got Lanys when she tied up with Al Kabor.  Basically, they scripted a war between Lanys and Al Kabor for a tie into depth of darkhollow I think? Or was it Dragons of Norrath?  Anyways, it was like the old tactics exploit in the pit.  They had mini bosses on both sides, but, eventually Lanys and crew won out and took over Firionia Vie.  What kind of sucked was I tried like hell to fight them off.  But, it didn't matter much. Besides, when you would screw up the script in the battle, you know by winning, the zones would crash and reset the script to the point it should have been at.<br />
<br />
Just in case, could you check into the glowing black stone quest? We know it is for a quest in stonebrunt mountains. I am thinking there was a shadowknight quest, with some spirits. During the quest, it should spawn as something the unliving.  The quest has never been completed, but, I am certain it will have something to do with it.  Glowing black stone identifies as Varsoon's black heart.  The dude will mention something about a more beloved dude, Varsoon can spawn as Varsoon the undying when Varsoon dies.</div></div><hr />

I was easily able to make 5-6 AA during the 30 minutes may lesson was up and could make 20 or so in an evening after work. I hated leaving that place but I eventually concentrated on actual leveling turning most of that stuff light blue and green.</div></div><hr />

I came back to EQ recently to find a whole new game. The Mercs make soloing possible for most classes. And now the new expansion will let you play as a level 50 in the old dungeons (Guk, Perm, Etc) for those of us who miss the good ole days.<br />
So when we pass Guk and feel that nostalgia, or miss raiding Naggy, we can now do those things.<br />
I think EQ has finally gotten with the times.<br />
WoW is still a cartoon game played by immature folks.<br />
EQ will always be supreme!!<br />
btw- Welcome Back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormspike</div><div class="date">11-21-2009, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  My old friends came back and the game is fun again.  Not the grinding it was.  I've gained 250aa and now at 67.  Just taking my time and actually enjoying new zones.  Some nights I spend just travelling around seeing old zones.   Anyway it's good to be back and good to catch up with friends after work and kids all to bed.</div></div><hr />
