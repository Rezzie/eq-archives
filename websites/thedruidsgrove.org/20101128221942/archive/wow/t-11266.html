My question for you guys is as follows, which skills would you recomend for a lvl 19 bg druid?  I was thinking balance as imp wrath and the imp roots could be very good in low lvl pvp, I am open to any and all suggestions though.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

But unless i'm mistaken wouldn't the mace make no difference if you're in bearform?  Only the stat buffs from weapons have any effect when in forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">11-13-2006, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Partially true but I remember my lower level bouts in PvP and a good mace can save your butt when your out of mana and still have some fight left in you...the same holds true for even 60 pvp.  I'd be tempted at 19 to put 5 in furor and 5 in Natures focus so that when I needed to heal I knew said heal was 70% likely to land.  I realize without Cat form Furor is kinda wasted but I feel it's better than IMOTW.</div></div><hr />
