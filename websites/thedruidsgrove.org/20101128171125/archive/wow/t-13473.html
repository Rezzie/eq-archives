<br />
the 2 I created earlier would not let me use the 'Invite Member' option ? Its greyed out ?<br />
<br />
Why ? What had i done differently to the one i created for our raid to OS last week that would let me invite members ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-17-2009, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so looking at it again it seems you can only use the invite members to actually invite people to the raid and confirm them once they've already signed up for it ?<br />
<br />
i was hoping/expecting to be able to send people an invite so they would see it flashing etc and then it would make them look at it and deicde if they wished to accept it or decline etc.....</div></div><hr />

I know sometimes when my husband sets them up the &quot;invite member&quot; option isn't available.  Other times he gives me invite privileges and I'm able to invite member.  I'm not really sure what to tell you w/o looking at it.  Unfortunately, I'm one of those who needs to see things to help =(  My guild hates this about me I think.<br />

I ask for screenshots a lot lol</div></div><hr />
