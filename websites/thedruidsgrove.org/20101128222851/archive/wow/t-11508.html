<br />
First off, thanks for all the excellent info on this boards.  This is one of the best WoW message board that I know of and its what made me make a druid.<br />
<br />
I finally found the materials for Green Whelp Armor (the chestpiece) and I had someone make it for me.  I know the effect rocks, but the stats are kind of lacking.  I was wondering what you guys would recommend for an enchant for it.  I was thinking +100 hp but I wanted to see what you guys thought.  I am still kind of a noob when it comes to being a druid so I wanted to get some recommendations from some of the more experienced druids.<br />
<br />
I have been getting jumped alot since I am leveling in the 30-40 zones and there seems to be a LOT of PvP.  I'm having a blast but it would nice to be able to put some of those annoying rogues to sleep every once and a while.<br />
<br />
Well thanks again for your help!  Take care and happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 stats&gt;100hps&gt;100mana&gt;3stats.  That's a generalization.  I think Resto Druids might favor 100mana since you can convert mana to hp's with heals... Feral might favor Stats since HoTW beefs up int/sta/str. etc etc... it's alot of variables ;)<br />
<br />
4stats is pricey/rare enchant so that might not be an option.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure all the new BC enchants have item level requirements.  So the 6 stats would be out of the question..</div></div><hr />
