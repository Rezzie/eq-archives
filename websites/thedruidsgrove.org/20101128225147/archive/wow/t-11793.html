So I've specced resto for my new guild... Tested out in kara last night and I was kinda impressed that it was that good.. I'm sitting at about 1250 +healing (i need more) , but im satisfied with this for now...<br />
<br />
What I could help with is that I would still like to do some arena pvp and bg pvp... I dont like the balance tree that much, and would like to use some points in feral... Guild is fine with me only having swiftmend, but I think 31 points in balance is abit to low for being a really good healer..<br />
<br />
Can any give me some advice of builds they tested ?? A feral/resto - leaning more towards resto of course..<br />
<br />
Thanks again dudes and dudettes..<br />

<br />
But. I've heard 34/0/28 is a good balance/resto build. There's a variation where it's more points in resto than balance, but I forget the exact.<br />
<br />
For resto PvP, 8/11/42 or whatever it is sounds pretty good.<br />
<br />
Best suggestions I can think of, and someone will probably be able to give you more specifics and the actual builds. Never tested them myself.</div></div><hr />

Here's my current build:<br />

I see now that 1 point in Sotf is just a waste... anything I should change here?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LieutenantKettch</div><div class="date">05-28-2007, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I enjoyed 27/0/34, although it didn't last long 'cause I don't have very good spell dmg gear and I MT for my guild so can't exactly stay that way. It's every healing talent I was interested in(swiftmend and NS), as well as alot of dmg output. Lunar Guidance and Moonglow are also excellent healing talents as well as balance..and Nature's Grace. I prefer that over full resto 'cause personally I think tree form is perfectly lame and crap but that's just me.<br />
<br />
0/30/31 would be interesting...get most of your healing power and can get down to HotW in feral...</div></div><hr />

I'm quite happy with it to be honest.. its abit &quot;wierd&quot; but it works quite well... Myself, 2 rogues and a warrior was practicly tearing it up in AB/EOS last night... unstoppable.. I really like resto for PVP these days.. .Lifeblook + rejuv basicly keeps everyone topped...<br />
<br />
Here's the build:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MzZxGMsZVEIteqM0o<br />
<br />
I know its &quot;different&quot; , but I like it :-) With my feral gear I can still actually do some dmg so.. And the survivability its just stupidly good...</div></div><hr />

Feral charge and an uninterruptable Cyclone are quite good.  You can play around with some of the Resto talents if you like though, I -very- rarely use Regrowth anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaeya</div><div class="date">06-28-2007, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all, sorry if I'm not supposed to dig older threads back up but I didN't see a rule against &quot;thread necromancy&quot;...<br />
at any rate, this thread addresses just something I was pondering...I was full feral spec'd with my druid, and enjoyed the wicked DPS, but didn't like the fact that in instances I usually ended up tanking (since there's plenty of DPS classes out there)...I hate tanking. I enjoy healing on my priest, so I respec'd resto...full resto. <br />
The fact that tree doesn't seem to be that great for anything other than dancing, combined with how horribly painful it is to grind/quest solo now, makes me think I should've gone for a feral/resto hybrid like people here are suggesting. <br />
More thoughts?<br />
In this thread, a 0/26/36 and a 1/16/44 build were suggested, Wowwiki suggests a 0/30/31 build for a fairly capable healer with still good damage and even off tanking capabilities. <br />
Questions:<br />
-How important is the Subtlety talent? The Wowwiki build, <br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zZxhGscbRxZVxIzcq0Lo,<br />
does not use it, and a fairly seasoned friend of mine said &quot;lol no one uses that&quot;, but both builds suggested in this thread do. Given druids don't have anything like priest fade (cat cower, but eh), pre-emptively lowering aggro would seem fairly important to me. Then again, that's 5 points that might be better spent elsewhere.<br />
- Nature's Focus or no? <br />
- I really like the idea of getting, in addition to feral charge, feral fairie fire, feral swiftness, and HotW back, plus nurturing instinct should help. How bad are the sacrifices made in Resto for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grubluv</div><div class="date">07-04-2007, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really like that build, personally. 2/2 nurturing instincts is a waste when shredding attacks and brutal impact are both such great talents.<br />
<br />
Not having full subtlety can be rather embarrassing because it means you'll always be the first healer to die in raids. You can certainly live without it, but it will have a large impact on your healing ability. Consider that tanking two or three monsters in a heroic is quite difficult even when the healer has all his threat reduction talents.<br />
<br />
&gt;fairly seasoned friend of mine said &quot;lol no one uses that&quot;<br />
<br />
Definitely surprised there. Every healer is expected to have their threat reduction talents in my experience. Tanked for a priest who didn't have them in heroic Stethekk once, and wow was he an agro magnet. I had great difficulty keeping the ravenguards off of him in particular -- it required a lot of taunting.<br />
<br />
&gt;The fact that tree doesn't seem to be that great for anything other<br />
&gt;than dancing<br />
<br />
Tree is pretty damn good now that they've changed lifebloom IMO. 600hps from a spell that costs 170 mana is almost overpowered.</div></div><hr />
