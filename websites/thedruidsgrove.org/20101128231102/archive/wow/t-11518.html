Druid Expansion Gear Lists<br />
AKA &quot;Is this an upgrade?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Player Emmerald has rated every piece of gear in the game for feral druids! <br />
<br />
<br />
Emmerald's BEAR TANK Equipment List (http://www.gurgleblaster.net/emmerald/Bear_Mitigation/Head.html)<br />
Emmerald's CAT BURST DPS Equipment List (http://www.gurgleblaster.net/emmerald/Cat_Burst_DPS/Head.html) <br />
Emmerald's CAT SUSTAINED DPS Equipment List (http://www.gurgleblaster.net/emmerald/Cat_Sustained_DPS/Head.html)<br />
For reference, the difference between the two cat lists:<br />
<br />
Burst = you start with 100 energy, from Stealth, and try to get to 5 CP's quickly and then Bite. Deal as much damage as you can as quickly as possible. &quot;Burst&quot; = &quot;use all your resources to go all-out for short time&quot;<br />
<br />
Sustained = you start with 0 energy, attack as efficiently as possible in the situation to 5 CP, then Rip, starting the sequence all over. Deal as much damage as you can over longer period of time. &quot;Sustained&quot; = &quot;something you can keep up for long period of time&quot;<br />
<br />
Burst damage is something you usually can do in soloing and PvP. Sustained damage is used against bosses in PvE raids and instances. Those are pretty much the archetypes you would have for Cat damage, with a lot of situations falling between the two.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some other gear guides found around the net:<br />
<br />
BEAR TANKING<br />
BC EQUIPMENT GUIDE FOR TANKING DRUIDS (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=62537221&amp;sid=1) - it is also a basic guide on Tanking 101.<br />
BC EQUIPMENT GUIDE FOR TANKING DRUIDS (WOW EUROPE VERS.) (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=104460564&amp;sid=1)- uses slightly different criteria. <br />
BC EQUIPMENT GUIDE FOR TANKING DRUIDS (TOP GEAR) (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=71584307&amp;sid=1) - lists the top gear and how it is aquired, instead of being a laundry list of everything available.<br />
<br />
BALANCE DRUIDS<br />
BC EQUIPMENT GUIDE FOR BALANCE DRUIDS (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=69639871&amp;sid=1) - Instead of just sorting by equipment slot, this guide lists equipment by zone and slot. The first post also has links to similar guides including a Scryers vs Aldor Faction link for Balance Druids.<br />
<br />
FERAL CATS<br />
BC EQUIPMENT GUIDE FOR FERAL CAT DRUIDS (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=104460524&amp;sid=1) - for sustained dps.<br />
<br />
RESTO DRUID<br />
BC EQUIPMENT GUIDE FOR HEALING DRUIDS (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=CEE34A018650A5F28F1F6BEA753  25D22?topicId=77554372&amp;sid=1)<br />
<br />
Check in on these lists when you have a quest reward or drop and want to know if it's an upgrade, or to plan what equipment you would like to aquire as you level.<br />
<br />
Also, check out the WowWiki Enchantment By Slot Guide (http://www.wowwiki.com/Enchanting_by_Item).<br />

You probably need a Google account to view it.  You can create one free:<br />
<br />
https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount<br />
<br />
Or if you have a Gmail account, you can use that too.  (Send me a PM if you want a Gmail account, I have a ton of invites.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The lazy staff ;) on the european forum decided they didnt want to work much more on the forum and unstickied most of the info threads there.<br />
<br />
some good druids made this druidwiki (http://druid.wikispaces.com/) - info and links (some same as here) to all guides etc</div></div><hr />

Bladefist's fury gets an extra 33 ap for 200 for 15 <br />
<br />
ancient dranie talisman does not even though it has the same use.<br />
<br />
Also<br />
the tsunami talisman has a chance on crit hit ap buff.  I thought that while in feral form that chance on hit buffs don't work for us.<br />
<br />
Who would I send the first correction too?<br />
<br />
and any explanation would be helpful on the procs<br />
