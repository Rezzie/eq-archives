The aggressive punch-throwing man whose finger was bitten off at a health reform rally in California last night now has a name: William J. Rice. And chances are, he won't be charged with a crime.<br />
<br />
That's according to Capt. Ross Bonfiglio, a public information officer with the Ventura County Sheriffs Department, who I just spoke to. Bonfiglio said Rice -- an anti-reform protester whose severed finger was reattached last night courtesy of Medicare -- is 65, lives in Newbury Park and has cooperated with sheriffs deputies.<br />

I think the discussion following the story on that site shows the depth of the confusion in the USA (especially the part where people refused to belief reports made by other than their favourite news channel).<br />
It also illustrates how talking violence in an attempt to rally support for your position is likelky to end in real violence.<br />
Finally, I wonder if somebody explained to him the irony of him having his medical expenses covered by the same system he was violently opposing.<br />

It seems to be getting more popular for people to start with a belief and then look for news to justify it rather than looking at the news and forming a belief.  News outlets are only to happy to cater to this and it makes it easier for them to market their product.<br />
<br />
This is exactly what happens when we pollute our science education with religion. &lt;gd&amp;r&gt;</div></div><hr />
