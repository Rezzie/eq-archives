<br />
One of which was CoS - it was the daily so everyone wanted to do it - i'd never been tbh so was keen to see.<br />
<br />
Have to say i loved it....the turning into a human, the way in, the architecture, thew re-living of running Strat a million times as a level 50+ for gear sets etc !<br />
<br />
Now, having never been there i was busy looking at the scenery although i had seen people in LFG asking for CoS Timed before - i just had no idea what 'timed' was for ?<br />
<br />
Even after we started i had no idea as i did not see any timer or anything counting down ?<br />
<br />
However at some point the tank says we are doing well for time ?<br />
<br />
Then we suddenly killed some ordinary looking mob and an epic mount droppped !!!<br />
<br />
(I did not win /sigh)<br />
<br />
So whats the story on this timed lark ? and does the mount always drop on timed ?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

If you don't make it in time, that boss isn't even in the instance. It isn't that easy as it only takes one wipe, or even a death to make it such that you are behind schedule (we always lose someone on trash just before we enter the town hall or during the gauntlet phase just before the extra boss).  You have to be fairy agressive pulling to make it.  I did it for the first time a week ago and we were moving like made men and only had 5 or 6 mins to spare.<br />

I love CoS.  Frankly, if you can do a timed run of CoS you have no excuses in VH.  As a timed run is far, far more stressful than anything VH throws at you.</div></div><hr />

The timer is Very RNG dependant though...I have cleared it with 7+ mins to spare and only seconds with the same group of people pulling at nearly the same pace! (had a group doing it everyday to get us all a mount)  The issue is where the next group spawns.  Sometimes you have to run the lenth of the city, other times its right next to you.  Chain pulling is key, and Resto druids make the run cake.  Its definatley beneficial to have instant casts and HOTs.  Nothing hits real hard, but many things hit soft and often.  A good tank/healer combo will make the timer almost everytime.  Bonus boss takes ~1 min to kill. (DPS depending)<br />
<br />
The gauntlet is the killer for most PUGs because your tant needs mean/mobile AoE threat (Pally/Bear FTW).  Also, DPS has to manage their aggro here, because the elite mobs are mixed in with the regular trash, and over excited AOE dps ends up dead quick.  Fun run imho.  Done it way too many times though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tbh it seemed very easy. i cant remember anyone dying the whole run......<br />
<br />
we had a DK tank it and a priest was healing.<br />
<br />
so does the mount always drop then ? seems like if so then i need to run it with the same grp so we all get one....</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the ticket right there... Running it with people you know have the mount asures 2 things: <br />
-These people know what it takes and HAVE DONE IT in time.<br />
-You don't have as much or any competition on rolling for the mount.<br />
<br />
If you roll with a few people that are Naxx10 or 25 geared, then getting the timed event is ezmode. I was never that concerned about getting through the timed event, thus i was VERY slow in even getting into a group. A couple weeks ago, a guildie asked for help with it so i said &quot;sure&quot;. He and I were the only 2 in the group without the mount, and when it dropped, he told me to go ahead and roll on it, too. I won the roll ^.^ ...<br />
<br />
strong AoE is the ticket. Having a feral dps helps, too... Kitty swipe is just SO sick these days, and switching to bear form for a couple of chain pulls just makes things go that much more smoothly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we ran HoL, CoS and daily Gun last night.<br />
<br />
Similar grp for CoS to past few days - ie 2 people had the mount so i knew i was in a 1 for 3 shot again.<br />
<br />
Great dps so as usual we blitzed it with zero problems.  meanwhile my guildie on his alt priest said he was not to bothered so would pass for now and get it later. then when it dropped we agreed to need it and then the other guy passed to !<br />
<br />
so i got it with a 34 roll ! lol<br />
<br />
so a couple more runs to get it for the others.<br />
<br />
We have never ever come close to losing a sinlge person. it really does seem a piece of cake. we've had 1 well geared person with us, ie a naax geared rogue who does around 3k dps.  but the rest of us are only geared from heroics/crafted.<br />
<br />
AoE does seem very strong for CoS...starfall and hurricane rock. although the good geared rogue with that fan of knives move he keeps doing is great to.</div></div><hr />

I've got to the Drake boss from 3-7 mins remaining ( 7 took me tanking jc i got the speed trinket and kitty dashing) That was with 2500 dps from each person.<br />
Ended up running it with 1700 dps ppl and had 3 mins left. <br />
( this is all single target not overall)<br />
Where the portals spawn and how far you have to run inbetween the &quot;portals flags&quot;  is key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but its nice to have it.....i dont have a chance for the mount/s that you can get to drop iirc in raids ? both flying and ground ones i believe.<br />
<br />
so it was nice to get the CoS one - especially as i'd never run CoS til about 5 days ago !<br />
<br />
i just went around collecting flying mounts in BC - ie i went out and got the rep for the Netherwing / Hippogryph and the Ray so when i found out the CoS mount was a guaranteed drop it made sense to add it to the collection even though i dnot use them much......ever :flipbg:</div></div><hr />
