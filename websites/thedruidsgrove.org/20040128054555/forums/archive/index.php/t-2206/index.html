<br />
I did notice that the pathing is smoother and they no longer Enrage.<br />
<br />
I have been told that there is some sort of exploit involving Enrage and Charm so Enrage was removed from these mobs.<br />
<br />
Edit added more kill info and comment about exploit</div></div><hr />

I've been there for many hours at a stretch without seeing a parchment drop.  Your friend probably just had a run of bad luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
noticed this on PoS giants (forest at least - was with the Imen Megirs not the shammy Fannask ones) too.  Wonder if that was intentional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eyeds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Damn near nothing enrages anymore nothing I have found in storms enrages atm trying named later too see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darmuth Daystar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Enrage is a bug, I would expect to see it fixed shortly.<br />
<br />
I don't know about there being a connection between enrage and Charm, I used to charm solo there alot and got 6% per kill, I still get 6% per kill without enrage, though it takes a bit more work to kill my former pet then before.<br />
<br />
They also do drop specs still, not sure of the rate if that has changed but on an average night of 4 hours I usually get 3-4 Eth and 2-3 Specs doing a basement, or 1-2 Eth and 1-2 Spec doing South Shrine.  <br />
<br />
I have found that Suits drop more specs then Humans though so that is probly why I get more in basements.<br />
