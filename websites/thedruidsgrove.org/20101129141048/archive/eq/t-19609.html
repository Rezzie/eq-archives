<br />
(08-12) 19:35 PDT LOS ANGELES, (AP) --<br />
<br />
Talk radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger has issued an apology for saying the N-word several times in an on-air conversation with a caller that she said was &quot;hypersensitive&quot; to racism.<br />
<br />
Schlessinger said on her website Wednesday that she was wrong in using the word for what she called an attempt to make a philosophical point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I articulated the N-word all the way out — more than one time,&quot; Schlessinger said in comments from the opening of her radio show that she posted on her site. &quot;And that was wrong. I'll say it again — that was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
She said she &quot;realized I had made a horrible mistake, and was so upset, I could not finish the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Schlessinger said she pulled herself off the air at the end of the hour.<br />
<br />
During the exchange on Tuesday's show, Schlessinger said the woman who called herself Jade was too sensitive for complaining that her husband's friends made racist comments about her in their home.<br />
<br />
When the woman asked if the N-word was offensive, Dr. Laura said &quot;black guys say it all the time,&quot; then went on to repeat it several times.<br />
<br />
Schlessinger did not direct the epithet at the woman, but said she used it to suggest how often she hears it, and that it should not automatically be cause for offense.<br />
<br />
When the caller objected, Schlessinger replied: &quot;Oh, then I guess you don't watch HBO or listen to any black comedians.&quot;<br />
<br />
Schlessinger also said that if the caller did not have a sense of humor about race, she shouldn't have entered into an interracial marriage.A perfectly valid point, censored by the political correctness police.<br />
<br />
You guilty white people ought to be ashamed of yourselves.</div></div><hr />

I don't like some of the names females call each other, or themselves, like bitch and chick.  However, IMHO that doesn't give anyone else the permission to use those either.  I'm going to call you out regardless of your gender.<br />
<br />
But, IMHO they should do what gays did, adopt the pejorative.  Queer was once upon a time a bad thing to be called, now they wear the label with pride.  Besides, it rhymes well in protest chants.</div></div><hr />

It's all how you use the word.  I mean, isn't that true of any word?<br />
<br />
Do I think that people over react to the use of words?  Yes.  And I include the words you can't say on TV.<br />
<br />
I mean who gets hurt if I say the F Word on TV?  No one.  Yet I can't even type it out here or it will get censored.<br />
<br />
The fact is that people get all bent out of shape over some silly words.   That's the way people are.  We all have to live with it.<br />
<br />
And if you are a national radio talk show host who's show gives out personal, marriage and family advice then you have to decide to either not go around offending people or deal with the fallout if you do.<br />
<br />
If you allow them to, words can hurt.  Of course we should all know that &quot;sticks and stones can break my bones but words can never hurt me&quot;, but it can be hard to follow though on that.   Humans are social creatures and we look to others for out self image and place in our milieu.<br />
<br />
Maybe one day we can move beyond this.  In the meantime, we have to just try to work toward that day and get along until then.</div></div><hr />

It's all how you use it.  I can use terms jokingly with my friends but if I use them as an insult to a stranger, it is different.  When Chris Rock is on stage, you know (or should know) he is making jokes.<br />
<br />
A good article about this is here:  http://www.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/08/13/martin.dr.laura.nword/index.html?hpt=C2<br />
<br />
You should read the whole thing, but this paragraph covers what you just said:<br />
<br />
But let's be honest, comedians of all ethnic groups do all kinds of crazy stuff on stage, dissing African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, whites, men, women, gays, Jews, the mentally challenged, you name it. So when the B-word, C-word, or F-word is used onstage, are we to say that is perfectly acceptable language offstage?</div></div><hr />

And if Chris Rock were white, what do you think would happen?</div></div><hr />

Have you seen Down to Earth?<br />
It's a remake of Heaven Can Wait.</div></div><hr />

Aye.  Hypersensitivity to a word only makes it more powerful for those who want to use it as a slur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amped</div><div class="date">08-18-2010, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slurs are interesting. Especially when adopted by the culture it was intended to offend. That is what largely happened with the word Queer and with the N word.<br />
<br />
But it is even more amazing that in this day and age the old saying sticks and stones doe NOT ring true and words (which have no power in and of themselves) can serve to stir up a whole lot of trouble, even when we are talking about largely educated, mature adults.</div></div><hr />

No?</div></div><hr />
