Whats not to love about Christmass?<br />
 <br />
Sit back, watch everyone overspend, Stress out, Drive crazy, and generally make a nuisense out of themselves and then...<br />
 <br />
Sit at the dinner table on Christmass while they talk about how great things are during the hollidays...<br />
 <br />

I try to avoid going but sometimes you just have to do it!  Long ago my family stopped buying gifts for the most part, at xmas.  So I haven't had to deal with that craziness for a looong time.</div></div><hr />
