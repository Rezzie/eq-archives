I am currently level 47 and was wondering what level do you need to be to start and finish the 1.0 epic quest. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Basically you can start now and get most of the stuff done. With some help of some 70's friends you can 1 group all of the &quot;bigger&quot; fights. Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Sinceyou are sub 50, you are looking at needing 2~ groups for VS and Faydedar if your friends are your level.<br />

If you have higher level friends, the amount of people is drastically reduced.</div></div><hr />

I thought you needed a L50+ (with correct factions) to MQ some of the pieces for you if you were 46-49, could be mistakened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Froglok Paladin did his epic at 48, and that was MQing the Bp from hate since it wasn't dropping at the time.<br />
<br />
This could vary by npc, and some npcs won't answer you when hailed, but typically the correct text trigger would give you what you needed reguardless.<br />
<br />
Its been 2 years since I did a 1.0 first hand however, so this may have changed.</div></div><hr />

My Druid, I was able to talk to the guy in Burning Woods and get the quest when I was 47 I think... You can get some of the items from the Corrupted and that sort of thing before you even get the quest if you know what you are looking for (obviously) :)... By level 50, I had everything because between that time I was messing around getting exp... I easily two boxxed a 70 Shaman and 70 Ranger for VS... My Druid was just there for the ride... Faydedar, took 1 group of 70s... The rest of it like in Karanas with the reapers or whatever they were, Duoed with a Beastlord friend of mine. :) Quest isn't difficult... Just find some nice 70s to help you out.</div></div><hr />
