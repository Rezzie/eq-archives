<br />
I am new the game... about a week.  I play casually about 1-2 hours a day &amp; I am currently level 12.  So far I have done most of the quests around Teldrassil &amp; Darnassus...  Also picked up some decent gear (for about 10s) through the AH.  <br />
<br />
Anyone have any quests that they recommend for about my level?  This game has so much new info in the early stages it is somewhat overwhelming...  I figure since most of you guys have been where I am you guys may have some good quest suggestions. Currently going through Allakhazams.. But so much stuff!<br />

Go to Darnassas and walk into the pink glowy behind the bank, this will teleport you down to Rutherian Village take the path down towards the docks, at the bottom of the hill will be a fishing supply vendor that should have a quest for you.  Take the quest she will give you a box and send you to the Hippogriff master who will teach you about flying and give you your first path to Auberdine.   You'll find alot of quests for your level there.</div></div><hr />

You can do well in Auburdine as Ndainye said, and you may even bumb into your first Horde!  Try not to go too farth south until you've gotten a few more levels under your belt.  Remember that you do not have to get all of your experience from quests.  Its great to find an area with monsters between your level and two levels below you and just kill them for a while.  You can also pick up some nice coin and random gear drops while grinding.<br />

I did go to auberdine to complete the bear quest.. at level 10.  I have been killing Moonkins since, pretty good cash.  I did take the griff without intiating the quest, I wonder if I can still get a quest out of it.. hmm. But will start questing in auberdine.<br />
<br />
Any specfic Item you guys remember that was questable that I must have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hertzsae</div><div class="date">04-05-2005, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't remember which quests give really good rewards around that level, but when you get 16, I'd go to get the sea form quest for Moonglade.  For that quest you'll have to find your way down to Westfall.  To get there you'll head through both Iron Forge and Stormwind which are good to find.  Down is westfall you'll want to pick up the quests for deadmines, especially starting with the defias brotherhood quest chain.  You'll find them listed by going to Allakhazam and looking up quests by zone and then deadmines.  You get a great staff for the killing Van Cleave quest in the deadmines, so do that as soon as you can find a good group and have a few hours to spend.  Doing all that and questing on the way should help you level up for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the lower levels instead of trying the old RPG mentality of &quot;grinding&quot; through levels, stick with the quests, they'll level you much quicker.  Plus, most of the lower level quests involve just killing multiple single mobs (instead of encounters with 2-3 at a time, like later on).  Most likely, you'll end up killing what you're already killing while grinding - you just get an extra 500XP on top of it :)  If I recall, the buzzbox quests in Auberdine result in a 10 or 12 slot backpack which is pretty nice at that level.  Just hang around the city, you should get golden !'s quick enough.<br />

...stay away from a quest from the dwarves named &quot;Large Ocean, Deep Sea&quot; (or something).  Unless they've made it &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; easier, or you have a full group of five, it's just not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milhouse</div><div class="date">04-06-2005, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually there is a way to complete the &quot;Deep Ocean, Vast Sea&quot; quest quite quickly and solo.  It's a cheap solution, but it works.<br />
Swim down into the ship and straight at the footlocker in the bottom hold, ignoring the attacking murlocs.  Use the hole in the side of the ship to get in.  When you die, and you will, make sure to die right next to the foot locker.  When you run back to your body you'll be able to open the box and get the loot without causing any aggro.<br />

I did it the hard way with idiotic pickup groups and death after death.  My 13 year old daughter figured out the 'cheap way' her first try.  Kids these days.</div></div><hr />

I just went back when I was level 60 and slaughtered all those freaking murlocs for revenge.  I also wanted to smack around that darn dwarf, but stupid faction wouldn't let me.  Bah.</div></div><hr />

At the risk of hijacking the thread....<br />
<br />
I HATE murlocs! I guess this is the reason they appear in virtually every area of the game! :mad2:   Thanks Blizz!<br />
<br />
Maybe we should have a most annoying mob thread....hhmmmm....</div></div><hr />
