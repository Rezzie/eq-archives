I think the highest I fought was +6. Beat him easy the first time, the second time he got two amazing crits and I was gone about 5 seconds after the duel started. I'm willing to bet that if you guys fought several times at +10 levels he will crit often enough to take you out within the first few seconds.<br />

One thing I've seen a good mage do is actually open up with a few nukes, then poly when you go to heal followed by an instant spell, then a big nuke. A crit on either and your likely dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homeslice</div><div class="date">03-22-2005, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm well... i had PW:F on, which strangely enough i just noticed then. I had just gotton out of Uldaman and was ready to log for the night when we dueled. So i guess i still had the buff from the priest on... allthough i doubt it makes that much difference really lol.<br />
<br />
We did fight a second time, once he was out of mana and he realised i had half mana left and i still had innervate he kinda stopped trying. Meh, i beat him that time too but it doesnt count IMO cause he simply wasnt trying the second time around. He was a ice mage if that makes any difference (i know some people say they are weaker than fire mages). But hes from &quot;Lords Of Death&quot; a leading guild on Blackrock server so i really wasnt expecting to even get close to beating him. <br />
<br />
The duel started by me &quot;tricking&quot; him i guess. I started the duel in caster, straight off he went for the polly, i shifted to travel, immuned his poly, went back to caster, moonfire + mellee. Throughout the fight he resisted about half my moonfires which resulted in me having to spam it 3-4 times just to get the DoT on him. When he nova'd i simply shifted to travel then back to caster to escape then ran in circles around him melleeing hoping he would get the &quot;target must be in front of you&quot; message which didnt work.<br />
<br />
Yes his nukes did hurt, 500 per icebolt on a non crit kinda chews through my 2.8k HP fast. True i was prolly lucky he didnt get a lucky crit, but that shouldnt factor in, if anything it would only show the mage won due to luck. Even with a moonfire crit i still only hit for 200-ish DD, and i dont crit much with moonfire being full res spec'd.</div></div><hr />
