Iirc, someone on these forums said they were in one a while ago. Should be fun and hopefully you'll get kitty druids, bare druids, moonkin druids, and healing druids in the mix :)</div></div><hr />

With the 4 pc champion set you could just relay the flag over.  Low on health?  Just pass it on to the next druid.  Game over.<br />

Something similarly as fun is a 10 man hunter group.  How would you like to be the other team with the concussion effect pretty much on the entire match. ROFL</div></div><hr />
