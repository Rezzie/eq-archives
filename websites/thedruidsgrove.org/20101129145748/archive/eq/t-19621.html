<br />
And this link popped up.<br />
<br />
http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/25/lindsay-lohan-released-from-jail-after-posting-bail/<br />
<br />
It is obviously important.<br />
<br />
And I am reading the so called story, and there is a link about her nails.  And a secret message(to somebody), and here is the link...<br />

I don't get it.<br />
<br />
And where did the link for uploading pics go to?</div></div><hr />

It's kinda cool watching the complete and total collapse of an industry or company while it's happening, during the process.  <br />
<br />
The topic of the thread was not about the subject of the Time articles, it was about Time. <br />
<br />
We can only imagine the desperate moves and gasps of buggy makers and buggy whip makers after cars were invented. This we can watch while it happens.</div></div><hr />

I suspect it might have been before I was born, because I never really &quot;got&quot; it--at best it was the magazine I read in the waiting room at doctors' offices because it was slightly more interesting than People or Entertainment Weekly or...whatever the alternatives usually were.<br />
<br />
I ask because &quot;washed up&quot; implies that it was a good read at some point.<br />
<br />
Then again, while growing up about the only magazine I'd have been eager to read (that was likely to show up in a waiting room) was Discover, or Scientific American, or maybe Popular Mechanics.  I suppose my tastes have broadened a little bit since then.</div></div><hr />

I never much liked it.</div></div><hr />

Please! This liberal thinks it's a piece of trash too. Find some other ideological group to assign it to.</div></div><hr />

It was common to hear the phrase, &quot;Time and Newsweek&quot; or &quot;Newsweek and Time&quot;, in the 70s.  Referring at the time to the two leading weekly news magazines.<br />
<br />
I am sure we could all argue on how far back we could go to the point when Time was first irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Time was the first weekly news magazine.  There were critics back in the twenties that called it fluff.<br />
<br />
I would point the finger at irrelevance, when you have three successive years of 30+% attrition in circulation.  1/3 gone, 1/3 gone, and 1/3 even still gone.<br />
<br />
And what is left is an online webblog that has articles about Lohan's nails.  It did not take a whole lot of dead trees to get that message out, at least.</div></div><hr />

Gratz on thinking Time is a piece of trash Panama, regardless it is still a liberal biased rag.<br />
 <br />
Will call Time a progressive rag if re-branding it makes you feel better.<br />
 <br />

I would nominate the jump the shark moment for Time when in 1974 they spun off thier 'people' section into a separate (and loathesome) magazine.<br />
