I went from over 3000 honor to less than 2000.<br />
<br />
Why does it do this?<br />
<br />
Where does the honor and the kills go?</div></div><hr />

It's your weekly and daily that reset to zero.  Do yourself a favor and screenshot your honor tab this week.  Then screenshot it next week.  Can better understand what your seeing that way maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">05-30-2006, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honor &amp; Hks are estimated each day until the update when it is actually calculated.  During day to day PvP you get honor and HKs for anyone you dot.  During the calculations, from what I have come to understand, certain things are sifted out to calculate your real honor and your standing.<br />
<br />
HKs really don't add up to honor though, turning in BG marks and winning BGs does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">05-30-2006, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly what I am talking about is the kills this week and honor this week tab.<br />
<br />
It will be higher during the week but after the update the numbers are significantly lower.  (kills this week become kills last week after the update).<br />
<br />
I guess I should take some screenshots but I'm not really sure how to actually get the problem fixed.<br />
<br />
I posted to the world of warcraft forums and people who trying to say that you automatically get hk's subtracted for not being a level 60.  I know that honor is reduced if not level 60, but I have never heard of losing 180 kills as a penalty for not being level 60.  If you kill 250, it should say 250.<br />
<br />
Right now my lifetime kills is less than 200 and I had 2 weeks of 200+ hks.  This could be an isolated incident as everyone I know on the server is getting their hk's and honor added incorrectly as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tuesday begins the new week.  Last weeks kills go up and this weeks kills go to zero.  Honor points are applied and you should see the red bar at the top has moved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last monday Blizzard messed up with the Honorable Kills and didn't add them into the week as they were supposed to.  I don't know if it was every server or just mine but it happened.<br />
<br />
That week I had 100 kills and 150 on that monday.  Instead of adding the 150 from that monday to the previous week they added it to last week.  All last week I got about 100 kills with the 150 from that monday which was messed up.<br />
<br />
So both weeks I ended up with over 250 kills but the 150 was all from the same day that they messed up on.<br />
<br />
It kind of stinks that I don't get any credit for those 150 but that's what happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit - 1st week they only counted tuesday through sunday.  Monday was messed up and they dropped it (that's where I got the 150).  Last week was still tuesday through monday although they were showing monday (150kill day) through monday on my last week stats.</div></div><hr />
