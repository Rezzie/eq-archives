<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Organtis</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of I love being a moonkin as it fits my playstyle well. I do alot of solo and some pvp once I hit 70. I like the ability to solo well as well as fit many roles in 2-3 man groups as well as some of the easier instances. I am currently lv 61 and have been wondering about how to spec, particularly the sublety talent. <br />
<br />
I have healed ramparts and BF a few times with alot of sucess but I am restricted to using Hots, because the first healing touch I cast i get pounced. Having said that I have been healer and dps without pulling aggro, with my hypnotists trinket. But, I am wondering if sublety is needed.<br />
<br />
Pros....<br />
<br />
I could open up dps more without pulling aggro<br />
I could use healing touch more, making healing more efficient<br />
I could add intensity, to boost my regen<br />
<br />
Cons....<br />
<br />
I assume I could no longer tank 2-3 man groups<br />
I assume I could no longer offtank to save a mage unless I cyclone<br />
I assume I would be sacrificing dps, by giving up a few balance talents like wrath of cenarius<br />
<br />
<br />
Having said that, I love to heal but cannot spec resto for solo play, I just can't <br />
<br />
I would like someone to help me decide if I should pick up some resto talents or stay 100% balance, please also tell me if any of my assumptions are wrong. <br />
<br />
Thanks.... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am Resto with Tree of Life in full bloom.  :wink:<br />
<br />
I used to have problems soloing, but then I worked my resto talent points around to allow for 16 points into my balance tree.  <br />
<br />
Now I can actually hold my own when soloing (it's a blast - I love balance spells) and I'm still healing at full potential.<br />
<br />
So, it is possible to convert to Resto and still accomplish daily WoW living.   :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing to realize is that as a healer you are going to take a few hits unless you are running with a good tank, and even then stuff happens.  If you do catch aggro while healing for a group, make it easy for the tank to pull the mob back off you.  I run to the tank so he knows I'm getting beat on right away and can taunt the mob off me.  Obviously there are situations where this would be a bad strategy, but at this level it's usually fine on non-boss fights.  If the tank fails at this and lets you die more than twice...time to find a different tank or a different group.<br />
<br />
I usually heal in groups, but the huge majority of my time is spent solo on a PvP server so my spec has evolved to 44/0/13 at 65.  By focusing on +heal and +dam gear, I so far have been able to heal and solo very effectively.  Self buffed my +heal is over 550 and +dam is over 350, can't remember exact numbers atm.<br />
<br />
I think all of your listed pros are accurate, although with Moonkin Aura pulling aggro seems to be a fact of life.  I also don't think any of your cons will actually be true.  I tank when I duo with my brother's shadow priest with quite a bit of cloth gear, and you won't see any change in your damage output with the points you take out of balance.<br />
<br />
For varieties sake here's a link to my armoy so you can see my spec.  It's a little different than what Serg offered, but it fits my playstyle.  I logged in my healing gear, I switch out a few pieces with Outfitter when I'm in Moonkin.<br />

I've resigned myself to respeccing back and forth between Resto and Balance once I start running Heroic instances.  I find soloing tedious in Resto spec and Dreamstate spec doesn't pack enough punch for my godawful PvP skills on a PvP server.  (After getting ganked for the fifth time in two hours by a different ally each time I had had enough and went to TB to respec.  I love my trees.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
I believe that Intensity, sublety, and naturalist will help me heal a little better in non-heroics without sacrificing too much dps.... I will probably sacrifice a few of the weaker balance tanlets..</div></div><hr />

Our HoT spells are far more efficient than HT is.  There's a reason that Trees don't cast HT...</div></div><hr />

You can still go bear form and save people with Growl... :&gt;  It's a taunt effect, you could have all the aggro-reduction in the world and it will still do what it says on the tin... :&gt;<br />
