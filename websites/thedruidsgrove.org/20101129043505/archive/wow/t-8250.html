<br />
They NEVER work.  I have not had these things work even once.  They give no message about failure and once, they simply vanished.<br />
<br />
I don't ask that they work all the time but at least 50%.  Even so, the ingredients to make them aren't exactly abundant.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't impressed. It took me days to work out that when I clicked they just had gone from my bags and into the trinket slot :). After that, they seemed to work just often enough to keep me happy.</div></div><hr />

Both times when we didn't really need it, of course ;-)</div></div><hr />
