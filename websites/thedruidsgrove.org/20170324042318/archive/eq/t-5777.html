<br />
-- why are they in ruins (and the one in PoG not)?<br />
<br />
-- why are there some that &quot;don't work&quot;? (Faydarks)<br />
<br />
-- what are the red markings on the stones?<br />
<br />
-- etc<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

About 3.5-4 years ago there was a loooong thread about this.  The thread was spawned by someone who claimed to be able to teleport at will between all the stones, including the inactive ones (WiseDruid for all you people who remember him :))<br />
<br />
The claim turned out to be false, but the thread that spawned contained a lot of lore about the rings and speculation about the markings, etc.  More than once I wish I'd have saved a copy of that thread :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids were probably sacrificing clerics.... ;)  Or visa versa.</div></div><hr />

Anyway archive.org wont help any as it doesnt seem to let you access the old posts. You can look at the titles all day long but no actually info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Rings were created by the first Elves, before the Wood Elves and High Elves became a seperate race.  They were abandoned after the Dark Elves were created and went to war with the &quot;good&quot; elves.  This was during the time the original Elven city (now under the Oasis of Mar) was destroyed.  Once the Elves relocated to the continent of Faydwer and began to rebuild, they rediscovered the art of teleportation to the Druid rings once again.<br />
<br />
The red markings were referred to once by Al'Kabor, but I forget what he remarked about them.<br />
<br />
No idea why some rings don't work.  I don't think it was ever mentioned.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it is correct. From what I remember reading the elves started out in Tunarea(now Antontica) until a group rebelled and started a war. The Rebel Elves then left Tunarea and went to Faydwer. This would imply that the Dark Elves were the original race and turned bitter and evil once the rebellion took place which formed the High and Wood Elves. Know anything about Druid Ring Lore though? That I don't. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravensign</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont actually port to the stone ring or spire.<br />
<br />
There are points of confluence in space-time in Norrath.  Through wise magic or science magic, people can use them for teleportation.<br />
<br />
The early druids used wise reflection to discover these principles, and built the rings to mark these locations and honor them as sacred. The early wizards, used arcane science to do the same thing, and built spires to mark them and sometimes magnify them.<br />
<br />
This is why you see druid and wizard spires near each other.<br />
<br />
This is also why, some places have stone rings, but dont work. The confluence of space-time is gone, but the rings remain. Conversely, places like SFG, that you can port to, without rings, are places with new rifts, that just don't have any localized structure built there yet.<br />
<br />
This is what al kabor is always up to --- seeking out these new points with arcane science. You can assume, from a lore standpoint, that the druids are trying to feel for new ones all the time too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Oryane, you're mistaken.  Dark Elves were created by Innoruuk by corrupting and twisting the High Elves King and Queen, which then gave birth to the entire Dark Elf race.  I think that's even printed in the original EQ booklet.<br />
<br />
[Edit]<br />
<br />
Just got this from the official site. It was the above mentioned Lore from the booklet:<br />
<br />
&quot;But is was on the surface of Norrath that Tunare's creation of the Elves, creatures whose limitless grace and beauty was only exceeded by their mastery of magic, drew the unwanted attention of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying alleys of the Plane over which he rules, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow gods for not including him in their pact and vowed to make them regret this disrespect. From the halls of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, The Prince of Hate snatched away the Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over the course of three thousand years. He then gathered the quivering pieces of these beings of light and rebuilt them in his own dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing The Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge were sown.&quot;</div></div><hr />

There is the link to the lore I was describing. It was released during the beta testing of the game. In it it states Inny was the original Elven god and other things. Basically, from my take, it implies that the Dark Elves were the original elves and that Wood Elves and High Elves were a group who rebelled and formed their own clans and beliefs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">12-05-2003, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye.  I remember that snippit from BETA.  But all the LORE in BETA did not make it's way to the final version of the Game.  I've sent an email to Allakhazam a few times to get them to remove that tidbit, but they want to keep it up as historic nostalgia.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Official&quot; LORE on the Elves is that Tunare created them.  Innoruuk corrupted them to create the Dark Elves and the High Elves and Wood Elves parted on thier own as decendants of the original Elves.  The original Elvish City was Takish'Hiz (now a LDoN Adventure Zone) and destroyed.  The Elves relocated thier empire from Antonica to Feydwer and rebuilt.<br />
<br />
I think there is still a bit of LORE about the Wood Elf/High Elf schism in some books either inside the Gnomish city of Ak'Anon or in the Planes.</div></div><hr />
