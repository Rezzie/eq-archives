<br />
I heard it from friends and thought &quot;I wonder what stupid thing they did to make that happen&quot;.<br />
Now it happened to me....<br />
My Account was hacked.<br />
I wanted to log in yesterday, couldn't -&gt; reseted my password -&gt; logged in and found my char completely empty.<br />
Only thing i now have is my kitty-gear.<br />
But i can do nothing with that, cause this stupid sh...-ass threw away my Journey's end...<br />
<br />
So the future days will show, how much of my things i will be getting back. :cry: <br />

See my thread in the offtopic subforum. Start a ticket ASAP. In my particular case, it was very easy for Blizz to investiagte and see that my account was hacked because i only ever log in from the same IP. I hope that's the case for you, as well. Read over some of the fine print in Blizz's security policy. I say that because it SEEMS to say that the first time your account is hacked, Blizzard does everything they reasonably can to restore all your items, but that doesn't necessarily mean that absolutely EVERYTHING will be restored. The second time it happens, however, Blizzard isn't obligated to put forth ANY effort to restore ANY items, since it appears that the victim isan't taking any measures to keep their account information &quot;secure&quot;.<br />
<br />
After getting my account hacked, I bought the authenticator, and I feel much more secure about my account.</div></div><hr />

No gold or consumables for about a week or so though... :(</div></div><hr />
