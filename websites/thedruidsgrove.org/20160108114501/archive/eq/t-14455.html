<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions for good spots/strategy for leveling up from 70+ while duoing with a Beastlord?  We're both PoP max flagged, KT flagged, and have all the expansions.  Here are our Magelo profiles to give you an idea of our gear:<br />

Druid (me) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=138478)<br />
Beastlord (friend) (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=316570)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated. <br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

A really good spot that my brother and I found (he's a beastlord) are the bear caves in Icefall. There are quite a few bears that spawn fairly quickly and just to give you an idea of how much experience they give, I was getting 19% AA per -solo- kill in level 74. I haven't been back to check how much they give since I got 75. It is a really good spot, though, for a group, for kiting, or for pet kiting (which is what you'd be doing most likely). They are not immune to snare and they do not summon. One round of DoTs plus a couple nukes would probably bring a bear to about 80% health. It's definitely doable. I could kill one with 50% of my mana, with barely over a 10k mana pool.</div></div><hr />

Choose your poison---  root/rotting, pet kiting, quad kiting if you have the mana-pool that allows it, charm kiting with a friendly wolf or bear... nothing seems to not work .<br />
<br />
Caution though: Bears and wolves will cross-assist... mammoths seems to be neutral and do not cross-agro any of the other animals. Spiders are supposed to be excellent experience in zone as well, although I have not tried them (just too many bears/wolves/mammoths to keep my exp bar moving to try the unknown and risks associated with the unknown)</div></div><hr />
