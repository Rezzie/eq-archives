<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">11-05-2007, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for a meta gem recommendation for my Tier 4 helm. Here are the three I'm looking at:<br />
<br />
Bracing Earthstorm Diamond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25897)<br />
Insightful Earthstorm Diamond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25901)<br />
Mystical Skyfire Diamond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25893)<br />
<br />
My least favorite of the three is the Mystical, because I cast so many instant cast spells that I'm not sure the casting time reduction will come up at the right time to get used. Of the other two, I think the Bracing is my favorite (I've been wanting the threat reduction enchant for my cloak too), but I'd have to re-gem a number of sockets to meet the requirements, and I just finally crested 100mp5 unbuffed. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts? Armory link in sig, if desired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-05-2007, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the Bracing gem myself: +healing is nice and us druids can sure use the -threat that gives.<br />
<br />
Definitely junk the Mystical one. It's useless. 90% of your heals are instant cast. You'll get absolutely no use out of any kind of spell haste abilities.<br />
<br />
I've never used the Insightful gem: I can't comment on its proc.<br />
<br />
I will tell you only ONE bane I have with the Bracing I have; keeping up with the gem requirements. A lot of my armor is Blue socket armor. Try keeping the above requirement when 4:6 sockets are blue, and you want the socket bonuses. ^_^</div></div><hr />

Probably not AS good, but it's what I went with on my shaman.  Then again,  my shaman has mana issues ( until next patch hopefully ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need more yellow than blue, and more red than yellow.<br />
<br />
So that means if you get 1 yellow gem and 2 red gems, you fulfill the requirements.<br />
<br />
Pick any yellow gem you like the look of and just fill the rest of your slots with the red +healing gems imho :P  Then you can point at people and go BOOOM insta-full health. =)<br />

The above still work out. The only problem I find is mp5 and +spirit are blue gems. ugh!<br />
<br />
I have a setup where I have 3 yellow, 4 red and 2 blue gems. I loose a socket bonus on one piece of armor (+4spirit), but I at least gain it on another (+7healing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 purple<br />
1 yellow<br />
1 blue<br />
1 orange<br />
2 green<br />
<br />
Mixed gem colors count as both, so... I effectively have 7 blue vs 2 yellow (the yellow/blue green cancels itself out) and 3 blue vs 1 red (the blue/red purple cancels itself out).<br />
<br />
As for the sockets themselves:<br />
<br />
2 red<br />
7 blue<br />
2 yellow<br />
<br />
Guess I need to look more closely and see which socket bonuses I might not care about.</div></div><hr />

How much mana does it return? That's the important question. And as for proc'ing on potions; I hear they are fixing that.</div></div><hr />

I am considering changing it though....uggg, decisions, decisions...<br />
<br />
Royal Nightseyes are fantastic gems and the way itemization works, alot stronger because the stats were 'rounded up'. I'm wearing Forestlord Striders with 2 blue slots and the pants from Opera. I had to do alot of manuvering to get the meta gem to work and I'm not certain its worth it. Hopefully some gear upgrades will eliminate some of those problems.</div></div><hr />

Royal Nightseyes are nice, but overly pricy.  The Jaggal's are a nice easy to find fill in which is all good for a resto druid.</div></div><hr />

I'd trade my T4 hat for something similar with more 'normal' sockets.</div></div><hr />
