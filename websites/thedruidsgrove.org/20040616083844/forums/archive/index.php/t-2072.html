There is the obvious Iz/Gy area you will see many druids aggro kiting with a DC pet (Young Wrulong) or just root/rotting.  I have since learned to move in and have found a few spots I can root/rot in peace without all the bickering over mobs and trains.<br />

You mean doomfire guardians/soldiers etc..? They don't give 30% aaxp per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Laniris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah to people making vague references to where they solo.<br />
<br />
I love the other thread on soloing frogs in PoS--it's nice to know about other options.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, I've pretty much lived the last month in the HoHa NW basement camp.  The first room has the spirit spawns (not what you want), but the back 2 rooms have 8 total guardian spawns (the humans).  The Guardians are snare/rootable (kinda MR at 63, but not too many problems at 65) and with 8, it'd take a hella druid to run out of spawns.  level 62, ~28k hp  Rare drop is specs, common drops are all the VT that usually drops in HoHa.  You won't get rich, but it sure does pay for KEI.<br />
<br />
(~5k mana and focuses is the best approx I've heard for quadding here--nowhere near that myself so I couldn't tell you).<br />
<br />
Only other thing to mention is the rare Sentry spawn. (not all that rare actually).  level 63, still ~28k hp, but unroot/snarable.  It's an excercise in running, but eminently doable--if anyone's having problems, I'd be happy to post a little guide with diagrams etc :)   They have a bit better chance to drop specs, as well as having an insanely rare chance of dropping a nice bard ring and a wristband.<br />
<br />
HTH.  I'd be super-interested in a list of other places in HoHa that allow for good soloing--the basement is getting old (~300 kills later).  If you don't want to post it for everyone, I'm pullusdemens at hotmail dot com.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TryonB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Is soloing still better EXP than a good full group chain pulling in HoH hero camp or Drunder pit since the solo-EXP nerf?  I know PoS frogs went from 8-10% per kill to 4-6%.  My ranger buddy got 12 AAs in 10 hours of chain pulling in HoH, can soloing beat that still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;I know PoS frogs went from 8-10% per kill to 4-6%&quot;<br />
<br />
They reduced the ZEMs from 145 to 119, so there's no way the XP should have dropped that much.  Did you gain levels in there somewhere?  As you level up, the XP bonus you get for relative level difference decreases, that may explain some of it, too.<br />
<br />
I went from about 5.5% AA per kill to about 4.5% on the gargoyles in PoN.  That's consistent with the drop in ZEM.<br />
<br />
(I do think you can get better XP grouping, or at least duo/trio-ing).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meperidine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pos had an artificially inflated zem to get people to go there... it was reduced to the same as other zones after nerf. thats why xp drops from frogs were so dramatic (but 6percent for cake mob beats pants off of hunting spiders in fire for saps and only 4percent)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tham Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoS frogs give a very constant 6% now at 65, and it was at 8% before, so a very noticable drop.<br />
At the moment I'd still put soloing efficiency above most groups. Anything that is only level restricted is a no-go zone for me, as people there tend to a) have leveled to 65 without any care for their gear and still wear what they have at 57 and b) tend to not know how to play their class well.<br />
Sol Ro is a very nice spot to group at. 2-3% aa off guardians and 1 or 2 ornate drops an hour, and pretty fast kills with a decent group.<br />
Tactics pits and HoH with a good group are also better xp, but I'd never attempt either with a random pickup group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Enkor Noblewind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In PoF near the fennin trigger is the best spot if your looking for solo exp. Each guardian/soldier gives about 13-15% per kill if your elemental flagged. Be warned tho, they are resistant and have tons of hps. I always team with a wiz and we quad it pretty regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bolodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The South Shrine in HoH is a nice spot to solo with the chance of 2 named spawning.  I root/rot everything but Sentries and the Named.  Those are more of a high speed dot/nuke type deal.<br />
<br />
When you zone in you just take all lefts until you get to the shrine then you take a right into the shrine.  This is not the Hero Shrine.  There are 2 rooms you can pull from with a chance to spawn named in each.  Each room has 2 guards at entrance and 3 in the actual room.  Facing this room past the 2 guards you will see a guard on the left and one on the right.  The one in the middle that you would be looking at is either the named or his PH.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ulnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With KEI, FT3, SCM2, evoc specialization and roughly 4k mana, i was able to solo Doomfire Soldiers/Guardians/Protectors in PoFire. They give me on average 14% AA but takes 10mins to kill one. If i crit a couple of times, i would have 20% to 30% mana left after fight. Its a bit better than doing HoH. <br />
<br />
Doomfire Soldiers/Guardians/Protectors see thru invis but they have short aggro range. They con red to my lvl 65 druid and are able to resist quite a few ensnares. I usually snare one and pull him up the ramp. Drop free dots and debuff with Eci and start nuking. At the end of the ramp is a big throne room which you can safely kite in there. No roamers are on the ramp nor in the room as far as i know. Root does stick but breaks fast too so kiting is a good way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Alyster Weedgrowwer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Right past the CoH spot in Plane of Fire where the two Birds spawn is a great xp spot as well. It's a SOLO Spot, not a bring a couple bots because there are Enchanter mobs there that will cast Dicate on you and charm you. If you're by yourself it's no biggie, just wait til charm is off then resume killing. If others are there you get sent on them. You can root/rot or if Birds are not up you can just kite and nuke. <br />
<br />
Also, if birds are not up and you're up for a good challenge you can solo the Magma Guardians (Big Lava guys). They dont' summon but take awhile to kill. I was getting 22-24% per kill for them. No cool drops off them that I've seen but great xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Feebbil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Btw those magma guardians drop Solidified magma, which is part of the Odylic vial (Plane of time key combination box) And also used in ceramic insense burner of ro (Imp damage 4 item). The drop rate is ultra rare though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaeerwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So does anything summon at all .. I noticed lots do not see invis but honestly haven't explored the zone a lot either. <br />
Was going to try and kite a few of the zone in mobs but my cleric toon was not flagged and all the other clerics were sleeping &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tendalus Treepimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's pretty safe to say that no lvl 65 druids effectively exp outside of PoP... am I right?  Any time I've tried to do this, it was rather lacking for the most part.<br />
<br />
So basically, assuming you're 65 and have achieved zero flags, your solo exp options are limited to frogs and Halls of Honor.  Somewhat depressing.<br />
<br />
I took a 3 month break from EQ just as my guild was starting to do Behemoth and A'Dar... and now their elemental and I'm just starting back up ~ sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Avendesoral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Deep water soloing Regrua and Feesh! was my favorite place to solo and get plenty of meat for making crab legs or BPPs as you prefer.  Easy enough to swim down and no one really goes there.  <br />
I forget exactly, it was something like 18%? a kill prepatch, I dont really pay attention now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Feebbil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I tryed to make it down in water to the Regrua area, since i need some claws of them.<br />
<br />
Well i wasent so succesfull. So have a few questions. I made it all the way down to the regrua area, only to be caught by a roaming regrua sentry (see invis)<br />
<br />
Which way are u taking down there ?<br />
I had to make it past the 4 a triluin champions which all see invis, but if timed corect can make it past them when they roam away, i gues u can take the oposide way true Wise room, if he is not up ?<br />
<br />
Also id like to know which regrua are u killing, as from what i saw before i got killed, they where all packed in rooms whith like 5 -6 mobs in each room. Is there a place where it is posibel to get only 1 or 2 of them pr. pull ?<br />
<br />
And finaly are they all snareable, not summoning ?<br />
<br />
I never really tryed this before because i always asumed they was summoning. But if not summoning id love to try kill a few of them, so if anyone can give some advice it would be much apriciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Avendesoral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually youre making it harder than it has to be ;)   You can go through the Wise room whether hes up or not, just make sure to hug the right hand wall and loop out when you get to the tunnel where the champ sometimes wanders.<br />
<br />
From there down that tunnel you have only the one champ to deal with, and if youre used to it, their reaction time isnt that great, and you can cut the corner if hes near the mouth of the intersection and swim right behind him.  Or wait the 10mins for him to path out of the way if you have lag problems or cant get the knack.<br />
<br />
Down the tube and left or right as a matter of your choosing to whichever drop off you prefer.  From there you stay on the ledge and you can pull the giant middle cave, with Offaasa in the far rear, up to the ledges.  From the ledge if the first snare doesnt land, and they are fairly MR, you run back through the cave tunnel and make loops (must have innate camo to avoid aggroing the cudda's and squids), at each sharp turn you should have time to cast a snare or root.  Once snared proceed to kite/root dot/nuke your happy way to thier demise.  Regrua tend to be less FR than feesh and on the whole easier but I kill them all as a matter of course.<br />
<br />
Nothing down there summons, aside from named, the sentry is not named, he will not summon.  Once you get used to it you can clear your way into the caves you spoke of and pull them all the way out to the loop if youre hunting for namers (Overlord or Protector).  You can kite down there without soe but I dont recommend it.  Some spots tend to warp them as well, youll just have to learn where to avoid.  When they warp you can take up to 4k when they slap you if youre stunned so depending on gear expect to die a bit before you learn. Regrua/Feesh and Squids/Cudda's are the two sets.  Regrua/Feesh will assist each other but not the other set, hence you can kite through the tunnels with no worries.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>pherrot69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I tried the regrua, and the feesh, was never able to land a snare or a root, which is all of 2 or 3 attempts before I had to exodus and wait another hour to go back.  <br />
<br />
Also, I was able to kite through the caves like described but no matter how many times i went round and round as soon as i stoped he was up my butt, i couldnt get any distance on him.  Any info appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, the 20 million plat question is ... How to you stop fast enough with the water drift to actually cast.  I haven't found any nice corners down there where I can wedge myself into so I can cast spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>pherrot69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">so how is it done? I soloed 2 or 3 yesterday but as soon as i get a snare resist on the pull im screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">/em looks in quizzically and ponders a new spot to kite.  mmmmm  lots of possible stupid druid tricks with hunting regrua  I like it.<br />
