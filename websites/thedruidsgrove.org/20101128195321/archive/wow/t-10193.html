All I've been hearing about in my guild chat is that druids are the best flag runners in the game.  My guild is really small (about 5 co-workers)and mainly focuses on battlegrounds capture the flag.<br />
<br />
What makes us the best flag runners? <br />
<br />
What talent tree is best for capture the flag?<br />
<br />
I'm level 14 right now and would really love some direction into becoming a great PvP'er.  Any advice or link to a similar topic would be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

In the 20-29 bracket, cat form with feline swiftness rules, and dash for getting out of the flag room is awesome.  In 30-39 nothing but a shaman in ghost wolf is gonna catch cheetah form.<br />
<br />
The next is that shifting forms breaks most forms of movement slowing effects, so while that frost nove might immobilize some other class, the druid cheetah shifts out and back and barely slows down.<br />
<br />
Of course stealth is great for getting into their flag room in the first place.<br />
<br />
Once you get the flag back to your base you can go bear for heavy defense and self healing with frenzied regen.<br />
<br />
So to sum up, stealth into their base, cat dash out of flag room, cheetah across the field, shift out of most cc, bear up if you have to wait for your team to recapture their flag, no class is better.</div></div><hr />

 ya...what he said. If you stick with pvp and rank to LT. Commander you will be able to get 4 peices of the pvp set that will add an additional 15% to movement speed in all forms. This will make your cheetah form as fast as a normal mount.</div></div><hr />

It will remain to be seen whether that means we can get even faster with items like nifty-stopwatch and swiftness potions.</div></div><hr />

Oh god the options are limitless, makes a alchemist druid awesome. Imagine the pots u can use catformed for attack speed, healing and dueling. same for bear as in tanking, and cheetah for escaping- heal pots for everyone!</div></div><hr />

From what I understand so far it is limited to trinkets and clickable worn items, so forget potions. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard don't really care too much about price spikes in my experience.  Remember what happened when they introduced the Thorium Brotherhood faction quests?  Kingsblood price shot through the roof, into the upper atmosphere and settled somewhere near the moon, and stayed there for several weeks.<br />
<br />
Also with each new major raid instance that comes out, different resistance gear becomes popular.  Right now it's nature resist that is in vogue..  (hurray for hunter aura!) ..and so all the NR gear is suddenly really expensive.  A 17 NR ring (no other stats at all) will cost you 80g on teh AH on my server right now, and the prices are still rising..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the OP... Druids are indeed amongst the best flag carriers, particularily in a 1 or 2 man flag cap team.  The best is really a defense spec'ed warrior who's supported by his team.  Lucky for us we're also excellent flag carrier support.<br />
<br />
More then any single talent, the secret to being an uber WSG flag carrying machine is Free Action Pots.  The mats for which are easily fished up (oily black mouths) or cheap enough on the AH usually.<br />
<br />
Talents are debatable.  Personally I love innervate... no need to worry about drinking up in situations where you either are being chased up the field, or need to swap forms alot.  Once inside the base, HoTW for the extra hp's would help for protecting the flag.  Nature's Grasp is good to have as is the Mana reducing shifting talent in Balance.  Feral Charge is great for getting up/down the tunnel and for stopping enemy flag carriers.<br />
<br />
To the off-topic people, I think the patch notes are reasonably clear that we'll be able to use equip'ed items... so no procs or consumables.... someone who's been on test should be able to clarify.<br />
<br />
I also think Blizzard very much cares about the economy.  Look at some of the Silthius quests... items like Powerful Mojo finally have some demand... I used to vendor stack's of them.  Nature resits rings are another example of some new flavor for old stale items.  FR rings have been going for good gold for awhile, while other resistance rings are DE bait... now there's more demand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stealth to flag room, drink free action pot, grab flag, sprint out, then cheetah across field.<br />
<br />
I have 4 pieces of the PVP gear = 15% run speed increase.  I have speed increase to boots = ?3%.   So, basically only people on a mount can catch me.<br />
<br />
When holding flag inside our flag room I change to bear.<br />
Armor 10300<br />
Fire Resist 110.<br />
Keeps me alive usually long enough.<br />
<br />
Bulldoser<br />
60 Druid from Spinebreaker<br />
Denizens of Defilement<br />
<br />
PS. I can't wait to get clickable trinkets in feral forms.  I will use my Blazing Emblem on those stupid warlocks and mages trying to blast me.</div></div><hr />
