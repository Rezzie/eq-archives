I am used to playing as a cat and am speced pure cat at the moment. <br />
<br />
Do these numbers look right for bear and kitty caps for hit rating and expertise? <br />
<br />
1% hit = 32.79 hit rating<br />
9% hit = 295 to cap hit rating<br />
<br />
1% expertise = 32.79 exp rating<br />
6.5% exp      = 213 exp rating soft cap (dodge)<br />
11% exp       = 361 exp rating hard cap (parry)<br />
<br />
       With primal precision;<br />
                soft cap = 131<br />
                hard cap = 279<br />
<br />
Also, what are the new stats to become uncrittable while taking at 80? Amount of health you would recomend? Amount of dodge? etc.<br />
<br />
Any imput is welcome thanks</div></div><hr />

I don't have any stats you can measure up against for any of the others at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I have to admit if i see an item with +def on it atm I do feel its a 'wasted' use of state points for an items ilevel.<br />
<br />
i also seem to remember that Blizz are still looking at druid tanks as there is a lot of discussion currently on the official tank forum.<br />
<br />
take a look here.... http://wowthinktank.blogspot.com/2008/12/druid-collected-ideas-on-how-to-fix.html<br />
<br />
i have to admit i've never bothered to much about hit/expertise but thats probably because i dont raid and saw little gear in BC that I could get with hit/expertise or gear that had it but lost me too much armour or stam of agi/dodge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">12-11-2008, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hit is also amazingly lacking on Rogue gear which shocks the hell out of me considering rogues need something stupid like 798 to be fully hit capped, but they typically only worry about the &quot;yellow hit cap&quot; which is the same as ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-11-2008, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Tanked Naxx for the first time last night.  We wiped a total of 3 times on the first two wings (Spider, plague).  I have just under 30k hp in bear unbuffed, and ~26k armor completely unbuffed.  Also my dodge is ~35%.  I have 3 epics and maybe 2 heroic blues, so my gear isn't crazy OP or anything.  And wipes were a result of fight mechanics, not gear or anything.<br />
<br />
My Expertise is ~8.5% and I was parried/blocked very very little.  (There seems to be a lot of expertise on the rogue gear I pickup which is odd since rogues attack from behind)<br />
<br />
I was able to eat the frenzy off the spider boss (Maexx I think) while all the healers were stunned, with sick ease.  Apparently you can still dodge while incappacited (which I thought was not possible).  <br />
<br />
If you are looking for other stats, let me know.  I am happy to help.<br />

Note:  This is for Naxx-10</div></div><hr />

Next week I'll be tanking in Obsidian Sanctum and probably Naxx.  I think unbuffed I'm only at about 27k HP, but fully buffed I jump to almost 35k which should be more than enough for Naxx to start.  I've only been 80 for about a week, but my god upgrades come fast and furious in the heroics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-11-2008, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too went to Naxx as the OT, but ended up tanking most the bosses because the fights simply suit Druids better.  (in the first two wings at least)<br />
<br />
...my god upgrades come fast and furious in the heroics. <br />
<br />
/cry, I now have 69 emblems now (run many heroics) and have only 1 heroic epic (its a DPS ring).  The Heroics seem to hate me for drops, but the experience is great and my regular runs are with a guild rogue who has fixed dice I swear!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">12-11-2008, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took my favorite pally tank with me on my heroic runs... druid gear drops all the time when he's there.  In fact for the last four days every time he went to an instance with a feral druid staff, it not only dropped, but he won the roll if there was no druid and vendored it.<br />
<br />
I only really have two of the heroic epics, but I'm not worried about it.  Purple = larger repair bill (not that I'm not oozing cash now that I'm doing quests at 80).</div></div><hr />

This has been updated to reflect new information (http://www.unbearably.net/2009/01/11/i-want-you-to-hit-me-as-hard-as-you-can-part-iii/). The gear list, however, it still very much up to date.</div></div><hr />
