<br />
then reason i ask is because i have a 33G hard drive on my laptop, with about 31G used after downloading the patch... i then get told that i need at least 6.5G of free space to implement the patch...<br />
<br />
i trimmed down my used disk space by deleting some unused programs, and it's pretty evident that i'm going to have to get a bigger hard drive and reload my computer with everything (ugh) when the expac is released, but im at least trying to get this patch...<br />
<br />
my wow folder takes up about 7.3G of space with addons... does that seem high? A friend that offered to help me out (when he gets back form vacation) says that once a patch is downloaded and implemented into the program, it's no longer needed, but i have no idea what to look for...<br />
<br />
help?</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't be surprised if that was a bit lower than the true amount it consumes given I have a copy of every patch since BC on my machine.  Can I delete the old patch files??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">10-16-2008, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's what im trying to figure out... it seems that even if i were to delete all the old files i could, i'd just be delaying the inevitability of buying a new hard drive... i priced out a couple hard drives from a reliable computer store in my area, and they're charging $80 for a 100 gig hard drive and $90 to copy my hard drive onto the new one... i have the go-ahead from my wife, but $170 smackers to keep playing WoW (which doesn't even include the price of the expansion) is a little difficult to swallow...<br />
<br />
now im weighing out the cost-effectiveness vs time spent reloading all my old crap onto the new hard drive (if i can even find the recovery disks from the original purchase). I have to admit that i'd rather shove bamboo shoots into the quicks of my fingers than spend hours downloading all the WoW patches from the start...</div></div><hr />

Personally, if you're going to have to spend money on computer equipment, I would say just go the whole way and buy a new computer.  33gig really is a very small amount these days, I don't think you can even buy hard drives that small anymore..  What are the other parts of your laptop like?<br />
<br />
How are you on computer hardware?  Ever assembled your own PC?  If you have and you feel confident to assemble one, I can help you pick out parts for it that will perform well without breaking the bank.  You can probably build a whole PC for about $600 - $700 these days..  Alternatively if you just wanted to get a pre-assembled one, I can help you to choose a good one :&gt;  I dunno, maybe spending that much isn't an option for you, but if you can possibly afford it then go for it imo - a computer is useful for a lot more than just playing games :&gt;<br />

If you routinely save your log files make sure you delete those.<br />
<br />
My WoW folder is 22 GB LOL!!!<br />
<br />
Ok, after cleaning up some backup folders it's a more reasonable 14GB &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
and yea, building a new computer is definitely in my future, but down the road a little ways, when we have space for a computer desk. I appreciate your input, annikk, and when the time comes to build or buy a desktop, you're input would be very appreciated.</div></div><hr />

When I get home I'll find the folder info for it... they can be in your WoW folder, but I think they changed patches to download somewhere inside your user profile not too long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">10-16-2008, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try looking in the following spots:<br />
<br />
XP: Your WoW folder<br />
Vista: Your WoW folder,<br />
C:\Users\(your username)\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\(your WoW folder),<br />
or C:\Users\Public\Documents\Blizzard Entertainment\World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
It's been a while since I've used XP, so I'm not sure if it could save in any other places for XP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, i deleted a lot of stuff from (username) folder, then WoW forced me to re-download everything that i deleted, and i wound up back at square one...<br />
<br />
it appears i'll just bite the bullet and shell out $170 to have my hard drive copied onto a brand spankin new 120G hard drive... if i even managed to shoe-horn the patch into my hard drive, come expansion i'll have the same problem all over again</div></div><hr />

If your comp is old enough to have a 33 gig hd, your video might be pretty marginal, too.  My framerate has dropped a ton since the patch, and from what I understand the xpac will be even more demanding on video hardware.  I'd hate to see you drop $170 on a new hd so you can play WoW only to be shut down in less than a month because your video card can't handle it...<br />
<br />
For reference, I'm running an Nvidia 8500GT in a desktop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
got home last night, downloaded the patches, checked stuff out, chose my spec, and proceeded to get pwnt in BG's...<br />
<br />
... but that's a whole 'nother thread...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it doesn't seem like the outlook for feral druids has improved in pvp at 70.  Maybe at 80 things will be better...</div></div><hr />
