Now at this point I'm almost 76, and was curious if the tank merc is actually capable as a duo partner. Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I did some charming with the merc tank, never had to heal much, just blew stuff up, that was in the 66-70 range. I tried some kiting stuff with the merc, that worked ok. But, that was beta. Sadly, besides the low leveling testing I was doing, from 1-85, I did not use the tank merc much. To busy playing mob chasers.</div></div><hr />

Grinding will always be quicker soloing than with a merc though.</div></div><hr />
