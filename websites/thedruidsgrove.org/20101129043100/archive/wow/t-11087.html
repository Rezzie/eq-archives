Blizz couldn't keep up with deleting all the threads on the official forums with the latest leaked talents datamined from Mondays Alpha update so they just pulled all of the forum servers off-line.<br />

<br />
when i first read the tree of life form, i thought it was pretty sad. however when you think about it, with tier3, rank11 rejuvs, improved rejuv + empowered rejuv, our rejuvs would hit for over 500hp per tick. in addition, we grant the other healers in our party additional +healing, we can cast lifebloom, and possibly regrowth? .. all for 20% less mana. not too bad.<br />
<br />
the saddest thing out of all of this? we still don't have an AOE Fade, gah!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
out of curiosity, what were u expecting from the bc talents? do u really hate the proposed talents that much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">09-20-2006, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sure liked the last set of leaked one smuch better too.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to get worked up over it anymore though til I see something from Bliz.  even the guy who posted these said they weren't implemented yet, they were data mined from the alpha server update.  I am sure they will be quite different by the time we get them.<br />
<br />
I think the heart is in the right place with these but the numbers need much adjusting and improved synergy.  For instance feral gets a bonus to dot and a cc that breaks on damage, doesn't make sense, but if they switched it from disorient to stun or something...it would be much more viable.<br />
<br />
I personally feel vindicated they are moving moonkin to a more melee role as I always envisioned.  Of course the biggest hurdle there is the swing timer and interrupt protection.  The swing timer we won't see fixed in talents or new spells, we'll need to see the patch notes for mechanic changes.  The above shows cyclone getting some interrupt protection like roots, and maybe we can combo that to buy us some time to cast a SF or something, we'll have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">09-20-2006, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for feral form, we just received 2 important skills we never had...<br />
<br />
Mangle: from wut i can tell, it will be a mortal strike for us. basically, an instant, single target attack for bear form. on top of that, it will bleed the target, AND be based on weapon damage. having a high dps/slow weapon for druids will finally be important. Hmm, mangle for catform... sounds like a higher power claw attack to me only, but we'll c.<br />
<br />
Lacerate: this will be our sunder armor with a bleed effect, to hold aggro like a warrior.<br />
<br />
hmm... as for maim, it'll be like a gouge. with only a 3 point maim, we have time to heal ourselves, or to set up for a shred. if it has no cooldown, we can do it over n over n over. that would be sick, so i'm gonna expect a cooldown on that. :) a kidney shot kinda attack would be nice, but oh well.<br />
<br />
as for moonkin, i'm gonna agree with u. i was expecting moonkin form to increase spell crit, as well as increase spell damage for party, instead of attack power? how odd. at least moonkins have decent mana regen now. cyclone makes the target immune for 6 seconds, so it might be used more for escape, or to shift out and heal.</div></div><hr />

These new talents offer nothing in the respect of letting us play as a hybrid. They just delve further into that respective tree. <br />
<br />
The idea of having stats have multiple affects according to forms like Int adding to AP is something a hybrid class should have. And seriously, more bleed effects for PvP doesnt help us. We need raw dmg and CC so the combo Maim isnt bad. Its a shame that it breaks on dmg meaning that if any idiot is around and hits the person or you put any of our new &quot;leet&quot; dots on him, the finisher is useless.<br />
<br />
And for Tree of Life....are you serious? There is no way in 25man, 10man, or 5man raids are you going to have room for a healer to be sitting in a tree form only casting hots.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">09-20-2006, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there is a certain amount of balance between us and the priests. the truly dangerous priest is the shadow priest. they deal enough dps to drop someone within a short amount of time. if they can't, they'll die.<br />
<br />
a holy spec priest is at a disadvantage also, like us in restoration spec. their fastest heal, flash heal, is 1.5sec, and isn't a &quot;large&quot; heal. they don't have an insta-heal, while we have NS. they have no root, so they can only rely on fear (which is on a timer) to heal themselves up with a big heal. shielding up doesn't prevent spell interrupts, and only absorbs damage received. so what happens when your shield is down, your fear is still counting down from its 30sec(28 with talent?) timer, yer wearing cloth gear, and u can't deal crap for dmg? gg.<br />
<br />
you really don't sound too happy about being a druid. mebbe u should try playing a priest as an alt, and see which one u enjoy more at the end. personally, i love this class for its versatility. we're definitely not known for being dps machines, but that's fine. :)</div></div><hr />

Well maybe you have the wrong idea of being a hybrid. You seem to want to be all things to all people all the time. Not gonna happen. You have to pick what you're going to do at that moment or fight. Need to tank? Go to bear. Need to heal? Stay caster and heal. Need Panzer? Go balance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-20-2006, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I donno about your last statement Lorath - the pallys in my guild have different gear that they use for healing tanking and dps.  Healing is heavy obv on +heal, while tanking is heavy on sta with +def, and dps has crit and stuff.  Also they have differnt weapons.  <br />
<br />
I would go as far as to say that a druid in 8/8 Feralheart can tank, heal and dps very well in just that one set of gear (weren't you just making that point yourself like a month ago?).  Not as well as they could if they had specalized gear...  Same is said for shammies and pallies.  They can do it all fairly well in one set of gear, but excel at individual aspects when they specialize their gear and spec to what they plan on doing.<br />
<br />
Your point is better taken that they (shammies and pallys) can do all things in one form - tank dps and heal - where as we have to shift around to do these things, then by bringing up gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">09-20-2006, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said gear shouldn't make a class... but without gear with the proper stats, the Shaman and Paladins will have to swap too. Actually, enhancement spec Shamans know they can't wear any tier set if they want to be a successful melee spec shaman. Well, mebbe tier 2.5, but that's about it. They swap gear all the time. I'm not just talking about trinkets, rings, neck, weapons, but they have to change every piece when they have to take on another role. eg. healing.<br />
<br />
Shapeshifting is part of our class. It is what makes our class stand apart from the rest. We are indeed a hybrid, but it takes more work to fully realize our potential. Strip us naked with no talent points, and we can still dps in cat, take more dmg in bear, and heal/nuke in caster form. When we specialize in one tree or another, we choose to focus on one aspect over the rest, that's all.<br />
<br />
Let's talk about druid hybrid gear. The type of gear that covers all of our abilities no matter what tree you specialize in. Tier 2.5, Unending Life set, End of Dreams, Tier 0.5, or the PVP set. You wanna be moderately powerful in all forms? That's the kinda gear that will make you. str+agi+sta+int+spi, spellcrit+spelldmg+spellhealing+critchance+atkpwr.   Now you have it all.<br />
<br />
It seems like Blizzard finally realized Druids needed gear with a wider range of stats than most of the other classes. A year after release, we are just starting to see Druid gear with a full range of stats. I'm sure we'll see more in the near future, in addition to gear focused on a specific role. eg. Tier3 = Healbot. :|<br />
<br />
Wrong Meshugene. Shamans and Paladins can tank, heal, and DPS with all the same gear quite well. Plus they can do it all in one form. Thats Hybrid. Hybrid is not having to be a certain spec wearing the certain gear to be 75% of a main class.</div></div><hr />

The spells are what is of interest to me, I think that they fill in some of the deficiencies that currently exist in the druid class. For example:<br />
<br />
Lacerate: obviously a tanking skill, which would make the bear a good tank and even better off tank, which 'may' make people think differently about pushing druids into a healing role.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom: heals on dispel? what was that mr felhunter? you want to dispel my HoT? please be my guest. <br />
<br />
Maim: finally a way to stun an opponent in cat form, allowing a quick heal or tranistion to bear/caster.<br />
<br />
These are really the three things that I feel might make up some the holes that currently exist in the druid class. An AOE stun or similar might be a good thing as well but you can't have everything. If these are the real talents then I for one would be satisfied. that's my 2 cents worth anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If these are real, I'll probably just extend my current 24/0/27 up to 27/0/34.  More +dmg/heal, less dmg from elemental effects, stronger HTs, and a heck of resistance to critical hits, and swiftmend - seems like a nice upgrade.<br />
<br />
edit-<br />
I was also comparing the priest shades to the force of nature treants.  We have a shorter cd (3 min instead of 5) and they last nearly twice as long (15 sec instead of 8).  I guess thats enough of a buff to make it a talent instead of a trainable, but i am not convinced.  [figure in a 15 min period we could use 5 times for a total of 75 seconds, and they could only cast 3 times for a total of 24 seconds.]</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the notes I saw had lifebloom at a 1.5 sec cast time, which would make it tough to stack three of them in 7 seconds unless you just spammed it for 4.5 secs straight, and by then you could have gotten of a HT and a couple rejuvs.  The efficiency will determine how much it gets used.<br />
<br />
Lacerate sounds nice, but maim isn't a stun its a disorient, which means it breaks on damage, like from bleed effects like lacerate, meaning it doesn't fit well with the new apparent emphasis on DoT in feral.<br />

I notice no one is talking about the supposed flight form mentioned.  Is that because you don't believe it?  If you don't believe that isn't the whole thing suspect?</div></div><hr />

I loved having a bunch of Druids of the Talon in Storm Crow form in WC3FT ff'ing everyone and mowing down whoever I was fighting's air units.  Seems like it would fit the history pretty well also.  KoTG was my favorite Hero too (which is why, I suppose I rolled a Druid in WoW), so I'm looking forward to at least trying out being able to summon treents (should it be true).  <br />
<br />
Storm Crow form could probably use the same model as an owl, or some of the other flying hunter's pets.  Seems like it wouldn't be that hard for Blizz to give us Flying form.  And they have to know that everyone wants it.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom seems very feasable as well.  Warlocks get a spell that damages the dispeller when it is dispel'd.  Seems natural that a druid could get a spell that healed whoever is dispel'd</div></div><hr />

and yes, that was what I liked about the idea, exclusivity...</div></div><hr />

The difficulty of the zone is an exclusivity in itself. Making it expensive to get there is going overboard.</div></div><hr />

If everybody and there brother will be popping through portals to see the same stuff it loses something.  I agree its fair and all, just not as cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">09-22-2006, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I figure it will be the same as Naxx. How many people you just see zoning into Naxx because they can? Very few because its a hard instance. Guilds wont be going there to just check it out and wipe over and over heh. Im just happy we get a flight form finally :D</div></div><hr />

My question is will we be able to reach the flying only zone with them.  If every other class has to wait until 70 to buy there mountd seems like druids could be the only sub-70s up there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna say no, because you can't cast anything with a cast time while falling right? So you could NS cyclone but then you couldn't shift back to flight form (has a cast time i think). But someone said that if you Feral Charge while falling you can avoid fall damage. So maybe you could NS cyclone, shift to bear, and pray you found a mob to click and charge before you also became a splatter...</div></div><hr />
