<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kikamafak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, great site.  Tons of info. I've been reading every scrap of info I can dig up, and so far it's really come through in my game play (if I say so myself).<br />
<br />
Couple of questions regarding Charm Kiting.  As I said, I've read pretty much everything I can find on this board and others about the methods, and people's results.  Mine seem to be a bit off.  <br />
<br />
I start off full mana, find target pet (in this case vicious raptor), ensnare, CoK, Savage Spirit.  Find target-mob (other raptors), ensnare, sick pet on it. Slam target-mob with Drones of Doom via ES Vambraces, sit, med, repeat.  Problem is after 2 or 3 raptors, and many heals on pet, I'm sitting around 20% mana, and pet's almost dead.  Currently this is at level 52 with 231 wisdom and KEI.  Now I could adjust my play style by not bothering to heal my pet, and just kill it off after 2 or 3 mobs, but the idea of keeping a single pet for many hours seems more challenging (and why else play the game if there's no challenge).  I've read posts of other players stating that they do this with little down time and a constantly around 70% mana.<br />
<br />
Any methods that could help out would be great.  I've attempted putting various other buffs on my pet (Chloro, SLN, Skin of Thorns, etc), but again it eats up my mana.<br />
<br />
The other possibility, at 52 is my mana pool still too small to keep a pet for hours on end, and wait till a higher level to attempt this when my mana pool is larger, and buffs are better/more mana efficient<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stormhaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Couple of possibilities - <br />
1 - Don't kite and just kill the pet.  <br />
2 - Get a horse.<br />
<br />
1 - For the best bang for your buck, snare and charm your potential pet.  Snare and DoT/Debuff/Root your potential target.  Send in the pet and make sure yours survives (this may mean nuking critter #2 or throwing small heals on your pet).  Once the other creature is dead, debuff charm (or wait for it to wear off) and kill off your low hp pet.<br />
<br />
2 - If your adamant about keeping your pet, get a horse (this makes sense for #1 too).  Remember that most NPCs at your level will probably have anywhere from 5-10khp.  That's a lot of HP to heal, and at your level, you don't have the multiple thousand hitpoint heals.  If you want to keep your pet, keep aggro on yourself by using a crappy spell like flame lick and stay on your horse medding the whole time.  If your pet gets aggro, you'll have to heal it, so make sure that the mob is chasing you.<br />
<br />
That's my suggestions, but my charm kiting experiences are limited.  I'm sure there's a lot more folks here with better advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jarilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could also try agro kiting the mob with the pet chasing after it and hitting it.  Use a low mana cost spell like ensnare and the level 1 fire dot - flame lick, in addition to any other dots you can manage to stack on it while it is chasing you.  You won't be able to sit and med at all while your pet is killing it but you also won't have to worry about healing your pet.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if both mobs are animals you could try using fear kiting, fear the mob and let your pet chase it while it runs away.<br />
<br />
Either way, good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>willain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For #1 - a successful hide breaks charm, as does invisibility or innate camo.  Very helpful for keeping the battle on your terms.<br />
<br />
For #2 - most people I've talked to only try this with the big heal at 58.  The earlier heals are just too small.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been working the same thing as you recently.. Some of the stuff I have learned through trial and error.<br />
<br />
1. Don't heal anything.  Just break charm on pet when he is too low and use the other mob (charm it) to kill your former pet.<br />
<br />
2. Savage spirit your pet.  ALWAYS!<br />
<br />
3. If you want to keep a particular raptor, or just try a diff strategy.  Try fearing the raptor your pet is beating on.  With this strategy, and a hasted pet, I can clear the whole big isle and have a pet at whatever hps I want in the end.  <br />
<br />
4. Try DS'ing your pet too for more damage.<br />
<br />
5.  With the fear method I actually like to pull 3 of 4 raptors over to the corner of the island that gives me the longest fear path and &quot;park&quot; them there in waiting.  I mean ensnare and dot and root them till my pet is ready for the next one. <br />
<br />
All of these strategies work realy well just remember to do some damage (bracers or ceramic ring) to each target.  I even went so far as to stop ensnaring my pet during the fear strategies because I wanted him coming back more quickly.  If he broke charm it wasn't much to ensnare and recharm but it made the fearing strategy work a little better.<br />
<br />
Just sharing my experience as I learn charming too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>VereSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Way I do it (for xp, not for the challenge if that is what you are after).<br />
<br />
In POS (or wherever), snare and charm your mob, then snare and root another mob. Stick your pet on mob without any buffs or ss.<br />
<br />
When both mobs are at about 10-15% health (assumes 2 mobs are about same level of course), cast invis on yourself to break charm and finish off the pair of them. <br />
<br />
This way pet takes no xp, and you kill 2 mobs with very little mana usage in next to no time. Pre patch the other day, I was getting 16% aa xp in under 3 minutes this way..shame there arent more pops :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kikamafak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the helpful responses.  Been playing around with some of the tips provided for the last two nights.  Don't know how charm experience was before Tuesday's patch, but in a little over 6 hours of play, I'm almost at 53.<br />
<br />
I've been killing the pet off until such time as I get my better heal spells, and so far have been able to get 3-4 kills before pet is really low on health.  Can't quite afford a horse, as I'm currently putting my high-elf brother through wizardry school.<br />
<br />
Been quite successful snaring mob, charming, savage spirit, skin like thorns.  Snare mob, pet attack, clicky vambrace target. Repeat till pet almost dead.  Them Camo, kill off both, or use higher health mob as new pet.  Played around with putting a few buffs on pet (chloro mainly).  Pet lived a little longer.<br />
<br />
Fearing raptors has been pretty successful, but it's a bit of a pain when they swim out into the ocean and charm breaks.  Rooting mobs was more successful, however mob keeps fighting till dead, so pet doesn't tend to last as long.  Anyone played around with casting Ro's Firey Sundering or FIxation of Ro on target mob?  Pet seemed to tear through it a little faster and take less damage using this method, though I haven't checked log to confirm.  <br />
<br />
In terms of mana efficiency, much better overall.  Can clear both islands twice before needing to med, and that's with no KEI.  With KEI it's pretty much non stop.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the help.  Looking forward to PoD next level, and getting some loot again.<br />

Additional:  When trying to charm-aggro kite, my pet was unable to significantly damage the target mob.  Seemed it was always lagging a bit behind and out of attack range.  Any thoughts as to why this may have been?<br />
<br />
Also, be VERY careful if using the tab-lock technique to target your pet once charm breaks.  Really sucks to root the wrong target (ie you).  Pretty sure I'm not the first or last to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jarilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just one last tip here.  If you prefer to use the &quot;root the mob&quot; method that you describe, you can avoid them fighting to the death by throwing a small nuke at the mob when you want the root to break.  If they are low enough they will go into flee mode when the root breaks and your pet will not take any additional damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nerma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye, on that tip.. I now call my ceramic band the &quot;lil' root breaker&quot;.  It works great for that.. about 3 clicks of the band is about all it takes to break most roots.  Odd that,  because the dots can go the full duration and not break a root.  But a good tip all the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">DoTs breaking root must be some weird red server thing.<br />
<br />
Never had a DoT ever break a root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Of course, if you have the root AA skills, you can cast a lot of nukes before root breaks.   And I prefer it that way, actually.<br />
<br />
With PoP frogs, follow the advice above.  No SS, no thorns.   If you have two relatively equal frogs, they'll go down in hp fairly evenly (you can do things to help if they're uneven).   Keep the target rooted so it doesn't try to flee at around 20%...you want to keep it attacking your pet.  Then invis when both are below 10%, one nuke each, on to the next pair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;be VERY careful if using the tab-lock technique to target your pet once charm breaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or don't use it at all.  F8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Instead of healing your pet, cast egress and run back to the island.  Recharm, continue.  Camping or invising out of pursuit range work nicely too.  Killing pets is probably the fastest overall xp, as you're taking the credit for mob damage and pet damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you're in it for the XP, kill your pet after each fight (without haste), or each second fight (With haste).<br />
<br />
If you have one of those shells that casts savage spirit (about 10k in the bazaar), you can haste all the time, but if mana is tight, you might be better off just setting your pet on another mob, and breaking charm when they're both below 10%.  Then killing them both off is just too easy.  You can do it with Drones from the bracer, or use the Luminescent staff to nuke them down.  (Drones is probably better, cause you can med while the damage is done)<br />
<br />
If you have the mana to haste, kill your pet after each second fight.  It should end up being near death by the time the second Raptor gets near death as well.<br />
<br />
By breaking charm when both are near death you maximise your XP.  I've been doing that almost exclusively since the charm nerfs.</div></div><hr />
