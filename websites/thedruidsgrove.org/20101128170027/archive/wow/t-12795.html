I suck at math but I am willing to read on how you come up with these #s and what you need to do and what tools to be able to understand it better.  Is there a thread that spits this out for those that seem stupid.   :grin: <br />

Theorycrafting 101 for dummies LOL  :nono:</div></div><hr />

My, what is going on!  I switch countries for a fortnight and poor druids have questions unanswered for a whole week!<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting is basically a way of maximising your effectiveness via maths.<br />
<br />
A very simple example is as follows.  Suppose we want to discover how much crit chance druids gain per point of agility.<br />
Look at your crit chance, then add/take away a certain amount of agility.  Then look at it again, and do Maths to figure out how much it changed :&gt;<br />
<br />
So, just as an example (these numbers are not necessarily 100% accurate), supposing you do this test, and you start out with 27% crit chance.<br />
You then remove an item that was giving you 25 agility, and check your crit chance again - it's dropped to 26%.<br />
Therefore we can see that 25 agility = 1% crit chance.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
So if we want to find out exactly how much crit chance we gain per 1 agility, all you need to do is divide 1 by 25.<br />
<br />
1 divided by 25, according to Microsoft Calculator, is 0.04.<br />
So that means we get 0.04% crit chance per 1 agility.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
(I'd like to take this opportunity to again point out that this is just an example and my numbers here are NOT based on the actual game or any tests I have done myself or indeed anything at all)<br />
<br />
<br />
Tada!  We has theorycrafted.<br />
There are plenty of other things to theorycraft, things like hit rating, expertise rating, armor values, and so on.<br />
There is a special website dedicated purely to theorycrafting called Elitist Jerks (http://elitistjerks.com) - if you're interested to find out more, or to just get the fruits of others work so you don't have to spend hours doing calculations, go take a peek :&gt;  Likewise if you have some other druid-specific questions please feel free to post them up here, and I'm sure we will all do our utmost to halp answer them :&gt;<br />

I have read EJ and they throw so many numbers at you it is crazy lol.  I wish I could read their site while at work but I will read some more when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">09-01-2008, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did try several times to answer and Annik has written what I was trying to say far more succinctly than I managed, but hey ho, why write a sentence when a paragraph will do? :D<br />
<br />
In terms of tools, Excel (or a.n. other spreadsheet) comes in very handy.  You can also find a lot of the maths behind Wow's mechanics on sites like WoWWiki, google is also your friend for this sort of thing. &quot;WoW Crit Formula&quot;  will not only get you a link to the formula itself but no-doubt countless pages of discussion on sites like EJ and others about whether its 1AG = .04 or .041 crit %<br />
<br />
I did the same as you and quickly scaled back my short term goals from &quot;I'll be Nellie, uber Druid and sage for all things game related&quot; to &quot;I'll be Nellie who'll try and not let you die in Slave Pens but at least have a good idea of what I'm doing and why&quot;.</div></div><hr />
