I do not have head enchant which I am almost revered to get, do not have my nightbane staff enchanted which should be tonite.  Bought the blue healing spellthread for my pants, and have not made my alchy ssc trinket yet so I think I can push out another 200+ healing when I put all those on.<br />

What were your toons +healing before you hit ssc/tk?<br />

When I entered SSC/TK on my shaman I had 1800+ healing, maybe closer to 1900, but that was also with a considerable amount of badge gear.  My druid was around 12-1300 I think come SSC.  <br />
<br />
If you can keep your lifebloom stacks up and a rejuv I think you'll do fine with your +heal level :)</div></div><hr />

You can click my link 9er fan posted and see my gear I logged out in it.<br />

BTW you like the idea of Alex smith being a back up lol.  Goes to show the huge gap between college and nfl.</div></div><hr />

You should be fine heading into SSC / TK (based on your belt you already have) at the moment, as long as there are a few other healers who are slighly more geared.<br />

Side note - my Chargers are gonna stomp the Niners this friday :D</div></div><hr />

I know this and have come to accept it.    No, I don't like the idea of Smith being a backup only b/c that's a huge paycheck for warming his nalgas on the bench &gt;_&lt;<br />

*Side side note:  I totally should have registered as a real character name, but I was new to WoW and MMORPGs, hell RPGs in general.....wonder if I can get one of the admins to change my name &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

I raided T5 content on my mage, skipped T5 and went straight to T6 on my drood, but I most likely would have gone into SSC/TK with around +1700ish.</div></div><hr />
