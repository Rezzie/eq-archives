I am trying to decide whether to go 40/0/21 for nature's swiftness or heavier into balance for Force of Nature.<br />

Is the damage output of the treants worth losing the instant heal?</div></div><hr />

ALSO sinse you put out that you would maybe use for instant heal, its still nice to have for that reason, but if you need to heal yourself in a raid your healers arent doing they're job correctly, you can jsut get the  Healing touch cast time reduce to help you  out a little which isnt so bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends .. if you find yourself dying to often and think u could have survived with NS, take it.. <br />
<br />
Seriously, try both out .. I'd love to hear what you think cuz its a difficult one..</div></div><hr />

<br />
with NS every 3 minutes i can survive a little longer in battle.<br />
with FoN every 3 minutes I get a am almost assured a kill. <br />
<br />
Hey, they have their problems but the trees bring a lot to a balance build imho. some classes are pretty much unbeatible without them in fact (warlocks spring to mind).</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF you only use NS for healing that is.<br />
<br />
If you do.. well.. more power to you.. erhm. :p</div></div><hr />

Trees do look fun, and are slightly annoying to me on my warlock, though I still melt through boomkins like butter.  Amazes me how many druids I fight in bg's / arenas that dont decurse...<br />
<br />
Elz, are you planning on doing a lot of PvP'ing, or mainly instancing?  If you plan on PvP'ing a bunch, are you goign to focus on the BG's themselves, or arenas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elziban</div><div class="date">08-14-2007, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stayed balance (roughly 43/0/18, without force of nature) for about 2 to 3 weeks.  Then I switched to 1/0/60 and haven't looked back.  I do a lot more to help my raid group as a heavy resto druid than I did as a balance druid.<br />
<br />
Having used both force of nature (I did have it for a little while) and nature's swiftness, I would definitely choose nature's swiftness.  Pulling out an instant root, hybernate, heal or whatever else is great utility.</div></div><hr />

It really isn't. If your guild brings you because you are balance (most notably Moonkin) Then they will definitely want you for that 5% crit, think of it as 5% more DPS for your party. <br />
<br />
Assuming you also went 40/0/21 You would have to make sacrifices to get NS. You could only max out one talent between Balance of Power, Wrath of Cenarius and Moonglow. All 3 of are very important for raiding moonkins, especially BoP (for me anyways) Helps getting to the hit cap, a lot easier.<br />
<br />
I have been thinking hard about respeccing to 43/0/18. I really only use my treants in PVP (although I do pvp a lot) and duels, since they tend to die fast in raids. I would like to max out subtlety AND Intensity. As a 44/0/17 I usually have to pick one, and I recently respeced to max out intensity instead of subtlety (only 4/5 now).<br />
<br />
In any case even if you don't go for treants (some moonkins just don't like them) I really don't recommend a 40/0/21 unless you maybe want to heal while DPSing in pvp/arena.</div></div><hr />
