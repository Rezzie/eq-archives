I debuffed him with Hand of Ro and Ro's Illumination. I <br />
took off my equips to make my ac lower. I guess the weird <br />
data in ac 1400 is just a peak value which happens <br />
sometimes, so let's ignore it. DPS doesn't means much in<br />
this case since ac is mitigation only, so we should look at <br />
the change in average hit.<br />
Apparantly the benefit from ac decreases significantly after <br />
it passes 1350~1400 mark. However, it may caused by the <br />
mob's lv is too low and 1350~1400 is just the ac cap <br />
against that single mob, so I went to plane of water and <br />
tested it with A Triloun Champion. I debuffed it with slow, <br />
criple, and 2 Ro's. Here is the result:<br />
 <br />
ac 1150: <br />
avg hit 361.71 <br />
dps 123.36 <br />
 <br />
ac 1276: <br />

I spent less time on this test(about 5~7 mins in each <br />
interval), so there are more peak values and seems a little <br />
unreasonable. However, we can still find that when the ac <br />
passes 1350~1400 mark, the benefit from ac decreased <br />
significantly again. The chance that 2 mobs from different <br />
zones and with different levels but have the same ac cap is <br />
pretty low, so with high possibility it's the ac soft cap of <br />
druids, not those mobs'. If this is correct, then the ac soft <br />
cap for druids is somewhere from 1350 to 1400 in POP. I've <br />
not tested in higher level zones like GOD and OOW, and <br />
I'm not sure if the soft cap will be higher in GOD and OOW <br />
zones.</div></div><hr />

The benefit of AC is figured out against the ATK of the meleer, not so much the era of the mob.  If you want a more manageable parse experience, slowing the mob wont affect things as far as max hit and avg hit go.<br />
<br />
A final number around 1350 wouldnt surprise me, since that's what monks got capped at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">11-24-2004, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's also dependent upon your AAs (and possibly level?).  The Combat Stability/Innate Defense/OoW-version-of-Innate-Defense line of abilities supposedly increases the AC soft cap.<br />
<br />
At least one developer also claimed that armor location is related.  I remember reading that AC from a shield (might have to be tagged as a shield?) has full effectiveness regardless of where your AC is compared to the soft cap.<br />
<br />
Still, as a general guideline, seeing a point of diminishing returns around the 1300s isn't surprising.</div></div><hr />
