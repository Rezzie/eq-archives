<br />
However, I am a healer for a 5v5 team (went into it kicking and screaming, but they are my friends, whaddayado?).  :rolleyes:       So as a healer, aside from the occasional cyclone or roots, there's not a lot of actual PvP'ing going on. <br />
<br />
This week, however, I respecced to Boomkin just for kicks, and I'll admit I was a little excited to try it out in Arena.  <br />
<br />
Now, I've been running Arena for about a year now, and not once have I ever seen another Moonkin in an Arena.  Until, of course, last night.  My first night EVER as a Boomkin, and VOILA I run into THREE of them.  I swear all three of them could actually smell my noobness.  Not surprisingly, I was pwnd.  <br />
<br />
I mashed buttons like a fool.  I'm not staying Balance for long, but I have another bout coming up, and I'm terrified to walk back in there! <br />
<br />
Did I mention that I suck?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
OH, and my team laughed like fools at the site of (at one point) 9 Treeants gleefully slashing away in unison.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you do see them, it is often as you described - with multiple moonkins.  And it is mainly because of the potential of having all those adds chopping away at the enemy.<br />
You can even take it a step further and have each moonkin equip a trinket that summons additional adds.  For example, the barov peasant caller on 5 moonkins would result in 15 treants and 15 barovs for a total of 35 possible targets for the bewildered enemy to choose from.<br />
<br />
It's a nice strategy because it's so unusual, stylish, and frequently takes the enemy by surprise.<br />
The downside is that it is easily countered with some AOE.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think in general the trick to being an effective moonkin is by being a sniper.  Try stealthing into the arena in cat form, and only shift to Moonkin when your team has started fighting.  Play it like a sniper.  If you can get off some nice starfires at the start of the match the huge dps will swiftly put the enemy team on the defensive.<br />
<br />
I am no expert on Moonkin pvp, but from what I have seen, the best strategy is the one where the enemy is hitting someone else, and you can just sit there and dps.<br />

Have you been training the Moonkins on Misha???  That's exactly what happened!<br />
<br />
Clever, clever, clever.  <br />
<br />
One of these days, maybe I'll have the prowess to be able to think like that.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As a dps class in arena, it is extrememely important to help your team out with active CC.  Rooting a melee, or Cycloning a random target (though not the focus target ... )  Disrupting what they are doing is often more important than pureley burning someone down.<br />
 <br />
I just got the Tiny Voodoo Mask from ZA the other day - summons 3 voodoo gnomes that shoot lightning at your target!  I've really been wanting to use it in arena, but unfortunatley it has no other stats, a long cooldown and I cant swap back to another useful trinket when its done.  Hehe that would be awesome with a ton of trees and those little dudes running around :)</div></div><hr />

I came across this post (at work...so bored) and it made me think of this video I recently came across PvP mookin Training camp (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvpcskbLU-A) <br />
<br />
Just watching this video made me want to start doing PvP!  :duel2: <br />
<br />
Soda came flying out of my nose watching it....hehe<br />
(Quick question, have you been seeing a lot of moonkins after that on Misha? or are they still a rarity?)<br />
<br />

i don't know about you guys, but i see DOOMkin pretty frequently in the cyclone battle group... both BG's and Arena... hell, it seems like it's getting to the pint where ferals are becoming more rare in PvP, and i've heard horror stories from a RL friend about getting stealted and pounced in arena, then MF'd VERY quickly to death by a team of 5 boomkings... it seems like it could be a VERY versatile caster/melee spec because of the AP bonuses that come on our weapons... maybe when i hit 80 i'll check it, and become a well-rounded druid :)</div></div><hr />
