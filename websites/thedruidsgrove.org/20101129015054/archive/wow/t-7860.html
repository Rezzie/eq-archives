The acting is great on the main cast's part, the story is engaging and intelligent, the effects are superb, even to the point of flawless in their integration with the rest of the movie, none of the effects look like cardboard cutouts or like something out of a Flash Gordon movie. <br />
<br />
I have one and only one explaination for the critic's bad reviews... closed-mindedness. They possibly expected the movie to be right out of Asimov's collective I, Robot works when in fact, and it even states it both during the credits, this movie was inspired by Asimov's three laws of robotics and his style of having the failure of those laws teach a lesson. <br />
<br />
It's not Asimov's future, it's not Asimov's robots, it's his laws. <br />
<br />
This movie rate's a 9.6 out of 10, it loses .4 because if I give it a perfect 10 then I can never watch another movie again :p</div></div><hr />

However, it was really good.  I felt that it even held to the spirit of Asimov's stories even though it was an &quot;action&quot; movie.  I definitely recommend it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I, Robot I watched with an open mind - because much like the LOTR series, I had not read the books.  As a standalone movie, it's a bit campy and very predictable, but much better than a lot of the other crap that came out that summer.</div></div><hr />
