I live in Indy - and we ended up with just under 10 inches of snow - about 1 inch of ice and nice blizzard conditions with blowing snow all night. Looks like drifts up to 10 feet in some places :)<br />
 <br />
Hope everyone survived the holiday storm! I actually don't mind as much as I normally would, as I got to stay home and watch the snow fall, decorate my tree and home, bake cookies, and got some much needed report writing done!!<br />
 <br />
Safe travels to everyone!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It did give me time to put up my tree. My 5 month old son, can't stop staring at it.</div></div><hr />

We were lucky to miss that storm that blew through the midwest.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The ice storm took out the power down here for over 600k homes, and some folks STILL don't have power. My county (Ottawa) has been declared a disaster area for the second time this year; the first time was in the flood of July '07.<br />
 <br />
I'm thinking migrating south is sounding better and better. The area of town that I live in lost at least 3/4 of the trees. The weight of the ice caked in them caused branches to start dropping, crushing cars, houses, and of course, power lines.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Most of the snow has melted now - in for another little rain/ice/snow this weekend. I am actually OK with that too.. I love snow for Christmas.<br />
 <br />
However, it all needs to magically disappear on Dec 26 and stay gone until next season!! LOL :)<br />
 <br />
Have a wonderful holiday everyone!</div></div><hr />

The mountain pass isn't closed.  There was one day of rain two weeks ago and forecasting for some rain or snow this weekend.  Northern New Mexico will have a winter storm watch warning.  If it gets down here, that would be nice.  Thing is, we can see the storms up north from down here across the basin.<br />
<br />
Often we will get snow on christmas and, of course, it goes away by afternoon.  The mountains look  nice, though with a white coating.</div></div><hr />

She wasn't at all envious, preferring 5-7 inches.<br />
<br />
That was one thing I hated though, about the national guard, was icestorms. I hated cleaning those up. Cleaning up forest fires, tornados, hurricanes, and floods were more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never lived in a place that it actually snowed at least one every three years.<br />
<br />
Coastal California...<br />

Where 45-50 is cold, and 80-90 is hot!</div></div><hr />
