Loading...please wait. i never even saw what killed me. seems the Devs placed our succor point right on top of 3 static mobs. and no..i dont mean next to them. i mean on TOP of them. i can understand maybe a roamer or 2 to make it a bit more challenging, but static mobs? thats going a bit too far. :bs: <br />
 <br />
 is this their idea of a joke? (&quot;just wait till they try and succor, ha ha!!) <br />
 <br />
  is our ability to avoid death, in a over-crowded, no-way-we-will-kill-here zone so overpowering they felt the need to ensure our death if we try?<br />
 <br />
  i gotta say im dis-appointed that our age-long tradition of &quot;well..if all else fails i can succor&quot; is now being messed with, especially since their precious favorite &quot;necro&quot; still has massive amounts of broken and **** will freeze over b4 their precious FD is modified or removed in any way.</div></div><hr />

I also think a lot of (the more exploratory among) us were likely tricked the same way.</div></div><hr />

 /shrug...ill /bug report it i guess it can't hurt</div></div><hr />
