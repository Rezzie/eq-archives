I know I have seen listings for Artisan skill books sold for 1gp each but where are the trainer/quests for 150 to artisan?  <br />

Edit: <br />
The Secondary skill books are 1gp (90sp with faction)<br />
the book for Fishing is in Booty Bay.<br />
the book for Cooking is in Mystral lake.<br />
the book for First Aid is in Stormgarde Keep. <br />
<br />
The Quests for Artisan are: <br />
For Fishing is Southwest of Theramore and find Nat Pagle. <br />
For Cooking is in Gadgetzan and find Dirge Quikcleave.<br />
For First Aid is in Theramore and find Gustaf VanHowzen.</div></div><hr />

Looks like you know where to go for your cooking and fishing.  For leatherworking you need to visit Telonis in Darnassus if you are Alliance.</div></div><hr />

It was the secondary skills that need a book to go above 150.   I did the run to booty bay on a PvP server to get that book and only died 3 times but a two guildmates with me died about a dozen (I run and heal like crazy while running they couldn't heal themselves to outlast agro).   The one in Mystal lake is SW of Astra a the east side of the lake.  I got there dodging a couple of mobs.   I am sure there is one for first aid but haven't looked since I don't have the skill to 150 yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the secondary tradeskill quests require level 40 and 225 skill before you can even start them, so your skill will already be 225, and obviously will be of somewhat level require to complete the quests. Rarely, like some fishing, will you need mods to increase your skill above 225 to complete the quest.<br />
(I used a +50 fishing mod in Feralas, and that's it. Rest I was able to do unbuffed)</div></div><hr />
