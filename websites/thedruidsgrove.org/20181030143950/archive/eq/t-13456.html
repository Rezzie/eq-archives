<br />
Last night we're setup in the field doing well and sure enough the e-mote fires...  and the Dragon Spawns right behind us and kills us =p<br />
<br />
The Kessdona Model Dragon proceeded to wipe out 2 or 3 other groups between the North Wall and the North Wall on the Stronghold  (not hard when it can hit 6500ish)<br />
<br />
The Drgon was up for bout 30 minutes before despawning.  The key point here is it was *not* trackable.<br />
<br />
So, just be warned =D<br />

When we want to kill these they are never up, but at 2am they spawn of course.  Have not seen any rhyme or reason for these spawns and they are only up for 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I was able to track the one we attempted Thursday. I forget the name but I specifically recall tracking it to see which direction it was INC from. Got the bugger to 5 before things went south :(</div></div><hr />

I've seen 2 of the 4ish and both were non-trackable.  Ragewind and Titanothan both show up on track.</div></div><hr />
