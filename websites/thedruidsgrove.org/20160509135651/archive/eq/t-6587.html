<br />
<br />
My guild just finished keying itself for plane of time. Trying to do some research on the zone to see what we are dealing with I have come across tons of conflicting information in regards to how the zone is instanced. And I would like some help on getting it all straightened out.<br />
<br />
Here is a basic summary of what I have read that I could use some clarifications on.<br />
1.<br />
I have read that an instance is created when you zone into start phase 1<br />
I have read that an instance isn't created until you successfully pass phase 1<br />
<br />
2.<br />
I have read that the respawn time on the loot mobs in phase 1 is 4 hours That it is 8 hours that it is 11 hours and that it is 12 hours.<br />
<br />
3.<br />
I have read that the duration of an instance is 6 days<br />
<br />
I have read that the duration of an instance is 13 hour 15 minutes<br />
<br />
4.<br />
<br />
I have read you can start a new instance so long as no one from another guild is in the zone<br />
<br />
I have read that you can't start a new instance even if no one from another guild is in the zone so long as that guilds instance is active.<br />
<br />
<br />
any help on clearing these points up would be appreciated. <br />

Yes an instance is created when you zone into p1, it wil be there no matter if you win p1 or not I think. I could be wrong though so someone please correct me. :)<br />
<br />
I need to post again, havn't in 2 months. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iisbliss</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I know: (I dont really pay attention to this closely, its has nothing to do with fashion, so it didnt interest me)<br />
<br />
If you fail phase 1, you can retry it again...it will reset on a fail but you wont get loot.<br />
If you suceed in Phase 1, and fail in phase two, same thing...you have to do 1 and 2 again...I think the reset time is just how long you had to finish the Phase...if you fail Phase 1 with 30 minutes left on timer, you have to wait 30 minutes for the reset.<br />
<br />
I know if someone accidently zones in the timer starts = p<br />
<br />
I know if you fail in phase 3, and come back the next day, Phase 1 is back up with loot mobs, but phase 2 wont be !!<br />
<br />
Basically once you get to the &quot;lore&quot; spiels, you have &quot;passed&quot; and wont have to repeat anything but Phase 1 again.<br />
<br />
Instances are 5 days and 12 hours long to reset...meaning respawn (except Phase 1)<br />
<br />
When we tried sharing at the same time it was about 6 months ago, and two guilds in the zone at the same time trying to run seperate instances didnt work, it got buggy fast.  Don't know if they have fixed it.<br />
<br />
We go in on our scheduled day, of our rotation, and start our instance regardless of the status of the prior guilds instance, whether they made it Quarm or not.  <br />
<br />
Last I heard from another server, two guilds in Time at the same time was still not working, the second guild was getting the first guilds instance.  I didnt think it was meant to be &quot;instanced&quot; this way, for two guilds to be in at the same time.  But I am curious to see if they made any changes.<br />
<br />
Each Phase has a timer, that you have to finish before the timer or you fail.<br />
I think that is where some of the confusion on hours comes from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct. You also want to make sure that when you zone into poTime-B to finish off the instance you started yesterday, so make sure you assign one person to zone in first for the duration of that PoTime clearing to avoid dumbbugs.<br />
<br />
2. I have read that the respawn time on the loot mobs in phase 1 is 4 hours That it is 8 hours that it is 11 hours and that it is 12 hours.<br />
<br />
Loot mob respawn in p1 is 8 hours iirc. Don't quote me on it though, I can't say I'm 100% sure. This point won't matter to you for very long though, as the &quot;lets do P1 latenight for loot&quot; will be a non-issue in close to no time due to the rot-factor kicking in.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.<br />
I have read that the duration of an instance is 6 days<br />
<br />
I have read that the duration of an instance is 13 hour 15 minutes<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, they're both kinda correct :) You get X time per phase to finish it, or you get booted out of the place. 1 hour for p1, 1 hour pr. god in P4 and 5 etc. However, nomatter how fast you finish the entire thing, Quarm and the other gods won't repop until they've been dead for about 6 days (+/- a couple of hours)<br />
<br />
<br />
4. I have read you can start a new instance so long as no one from another guild is in the zone<br />
<br />
<br />
Correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really an issue I play on FV nothing and I mean nothing ever rots on FV unless your the only person in the zone and the item your looting is lore and you already have one thats not in your shared bank space.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it gets looted. Goes to an alt, gifted to someone, or sold in the bazaar.<br />

It lets each raid/guild get a full spawn and clear it over several attempts/days as long as they don't try and do an attempt at the same time as anybody else. No idea why they don't instance it LDoN style, the GY'ing of corpses in timeB is pointless and it would be far better just to eject them to TimeA when the clock runs out.</div></div><hr />

There is one other Time enabled guild on the server. What you are asking is impossible as the relationship between the two guilds makes the Hatfields and Mccoy's look like civilized beings. I won't go into details as I have no intention of dragging interguild politics to this board.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say going to them and talking to them is not feasible at this time at any rate.<br />
<br />
Just so you know we are also the only two E-planes enabled guilds on the server.  There are also only 4 maybe 5 guilds who have access to VT, one of which is only  just now learning the zone.<br />
<br />
Playing on a low population server has its plusses and minuses.<br />

If the first guild isn't Quarm capable, it's pretty easy to enforce a rotation.  Just get everyone to Time.  Summon a guide.  If the first guild wipes, they need to leave the zone so you get your chance.<br />
<br />
Of course, they could do the same to you.  It makes learning encounters that much more difficult.  Most people are motivated to play nice when faced with this enviroment.</div></div><hr />

Yes it sucks but nothing much we can do until sony properly instances poTime instead of this half-baked thing they've got going now.Actually, I have heard that the GMs support the &quot;multiple guilds cooperating&quot; idea.  Guilds that grief others by messing with their Time rotation don't stay guilds for long.  Bannings and/or suspensions can go along with this as well.  Welcome to the playground, ******s!  :)<br />
<br />
One thing... Failed tier 1s can be restarted after an hour.  Tier 1 trials that WERE won and yielded loot won't yield loot again for 8 hours.  Failed tier 1 trials that were lost and the boss never died will still yield loot until the boss dies.  So if you try tier 1 and win the rock and water trials and fail the others... then go back to start the tier 1 an hour later and win ALL 5 trials... you will only get loot from the 3 that weren't won the first time.  This resets every 8 hours.</div></div><hr />

Suffice to say going to them and talking to them is not feasible at this time at any rate. I'll be nice and point out that either guild doesn't have a clue yet as to how it the timer works.  You start your instance, and 5 days later it resets, regardless if you cleared to and killed Quarm the first day, or if you were stuck in Tier 1 all five days.  So, let's say the first guild needs 3 days to get as far as they can.  Then for 2 days, you are in time.  May not be equitable, but you get the drift. <br />
