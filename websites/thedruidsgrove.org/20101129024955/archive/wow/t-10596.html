<br />
You'll be able to try out the new armour when the 1.11 test realms go live.<br />
<br />
For now you can take a look at them here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/index.html?4,0,5,male).<br />
<br />
Talk about a leap in stats... I wonder what it will do to PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give'n the Set Bonuses are 90% class specific abilities upgrades... I'd guess when they go live it'll only be avilable to their designated classes... but who knows.</div></div><hr />

Ooooh, maybe we'll finally be able to snag some rogue gear for a fear set. ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if you could just use rank 1 rejuvination and help people restore mana, rage, energy.<br />
<br />
It might even be useful to keep it on the tank for extra rage.<br />
<br />
Just an idea - I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaEsoteric</div><div class="date">05-18-2006, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the armor will be on a token system like ZG/AQ and the tokens will probably be class specific and BoP.  So with specific quests it would still be class specific gear.  But they may have not included it in the tool tip simply because you are look at the druid set, so it should be a no brainer which class can use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this stuff on you could be a great healer with absolutely no points in resto at all, especially with the innervate change.  That change and this set has given high end raid druids the freedom to spec however they want.  It is feral friendly, indirectly.</div></div><hr />

I don't want gear that makes me a capable HEALER when I'm feral specced. Why isn't there a set that augments a feral specced druid? Something like the Wolfshead Helm (adjusted for level) that gives rage or energy when shapeshifting, or that specifically improves our stealth ability in cat or our aggro holding in dire bear form. It just seems that there's nothing to augment druids in the ability that really separates druids from the other classes. This armor makes our healing potential so powerful all anybody will EVER want us to do is heal.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I have to agree,  while its nice that a feral druid can if need be throw on this suit and do decent healing,  ive yet to see much that helps us with our feral line or even gives us a benefit to being feral.<br />
 <br />
But this is a problem im sure all classes are seeing,  the sets tailor to 1 specific build over the other 2.<br />
 <br />
It'd be cool if instead they made 1 set with 3 different types of stats,  and you could do a quest or pay to shift them from one talent line to another.</div></div><hr />
