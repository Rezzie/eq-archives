We did it with 5 people, one playing naggy, one the king and 3 healers.  The key was to get naggy set up just at the start of the bridge so his cone of fire and fear hit as many mobs as possible...and the healers staying ready to cheal.  Good idea to have the healers tucked up next to a wall so that they wont get interrupted casting once they grab agro.<br />

Good exp, ok loot and a ton of fun.<br />
