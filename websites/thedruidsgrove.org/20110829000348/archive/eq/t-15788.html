<br />
Played a little EQ2, WOW, and such over the years, but found them all a little dull.  Most recently have been trying Vanguard and gave the combo game sub a whirl to visit EQ. <br />
<br />
Futzing around in EQ a little ... never thought I would again and honestly am not sure I will do it for long.  Hard to jump back in 6 expansions or so later and figure out what the heck to do.  10 levels under cap; ghetto aa (144 or something).  <br />
<br />
Going to pick up the anniversary edition next week, but right now only have through DoD.  Of course most of the zones I have are empty, and I am not sure I am ready to plunge into a group yet so I have been root rotting a bit (and that oddly feels like I have just come off of doing it for 3 years!).<br />
<br />
Looks kind of hopeless to get some of the past expansion spells that seem to need groups in zones people don't go to anymore too, but I don't really care too much about that at the moment.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hoping for a few tips on zones to try out as I try to find my EQ legs a bit.  Again, I have expansions through DoD and was last playing until just after LDON came out and have a mix of VT and early planes gear...level 65 atm.  Kind of ghetto stuff I think these days but gear is something I can worry about later if I find I catch the bug again.  <br />
<br />
So....what does one do these days to relearn the game?  Tips? Suggestions?  All are welcome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
These days you can gear up quite quickly with just the help of a few friends.  You can get your hands on ~200hp/mana gear without too much trouble.<br />
<br />
DoD mission arcs are a good place to look - http://samanna.net/gen.info/prog.dod.shtml.  They aren't so popular these days because most people look at the current content... but if you explore that site (particularly the &quot;EQ Progression&quot; and &quot;Everquest General&quot; pulldown menus) you'll see what kind of content and gear is out there waiting for you :)</div></div><hr />

http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/posts/list.m?topic_id=34207<br />
<br />
As for gear, I'll second the recommendation of starting with DoD tasks.  In particular, see if you can find people working on the clicky mask that you get for completing 23 DoD tasks in 5 arcs.  They'll likely appreciate all the help they can get, especially if you tell them you'll help with any of the tasks they need.  And you'll get a guaranteed item at the end of every task, plus the possibility of a second item in a chest.<br />
The end result from completing 23 DoD tasks is:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=85571<br />
...which evolves to:<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=85573<br />
<br />
People will be doing those tasks for a long time since the clicky effect (+50 to all resists, stacks with almost everything) is helpful to all but the top end raiders that may be maxing out resists from worn gear alone.  Even if you don't complete all of them yourself, you'll get 1 or 2 halfway decent items from every task along the way.  Two of the arcs give you a spell at the end as well, and one of the tasks, &quot;69.1&quot;--which is completely kiteable--serves yet another purpose: 1/4 of the key to Dreadspire.<br />
<br />
Focus effects will be somewhat rare, though you can buy focus effect augments from DoN merchants using crystals (which you can earn doing easy DoN tasks or by buying them in the bazaar).  Check the gear on the merchants too--a few pieces might be worth buying for now.  Specifically the Goad of the Just comes to mind:<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO TRADE<br />
Slot: PRIMARY<br />
Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 20<br />
DMG: 18 Dmg Bonus: 16<br />
DEX: +9 STA: +7 WIS: +11 AGI: +8 HP: +70 MANA: +75<br />
SV DISEASE: +11 SV COLD: +9 SV POISON: +12<br />
Recommended level of 65. Required level of 58.<br />
Focus: Speed of Mithaniel<br />
WT: 2.0 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: CLR DRU SHM<br />
Race: ALL<br />
Slot 1, Type 4<br />
Slot 2, Type 9<br />
<br />
(25% beneficial spell haste is fantastic for what is effectively a vendor purchaseable item!)<br />
<br />
After a while you'll be ready to move up to things like TSS quest gear, and possibly TBS merchant gear (though I haven't looked very closely at this option).<br />
<br />
Also, depending on your server, there may be easy pickup raids that you can attend.  Time is a popular target for those; you may be able to get in on some early DoN raids as well.<br />
<br />
If you post your server, people here might be able to help out.  I can also give you the name of a guild member that recently returned from a 2 year absence, if you'd like; he's a paladin, but he might have some good advice from the perspective of someone that had been away from the game for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you like Vanguard?  I haven't heard much about it.  I've been dabbling in WoW since early December, and am having a bit of fun with that.<br />
<br />
Great to see you around the Grove again!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoak</div><div class="date">04-30-2007, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanguard is ok.  I honestly thought I was liking it a lot but I hit a bit of a wall at level 18 and I just got bored.<br />
<br />
Like every other game since EQ, the leveling is probably a little too fast.  My big beef with WOW was that I never felt I got to know a zone because I leveled through them so fast.  Never grouped much and didn't need to, but the few times I did the game just felt chaotic.<br />
<br />
Vanguard has an issue with travel.  Part of the design but it gets stupid after a short time.  You travel a route a few times and you know the world is big.  Doing it every time you want to move around the gameworld is just annoying.<br />
<br />
I also found that it was a little too safe to explore too much of the world.  Saw most of it (other than dangerous dungeon type areas) by 18.<br />
<br />
And a fair amount of faction grinding involved, which I don't mind exactly but when there is a lot of it to do....<br />
<br />
The diplomacy card battle system was an interesting addition.  Something new for a MMOG, but also another treadmill to walk if you get caught up in it.<br />
<br />
Game lore is ok, but I think the early content is better written and the later content already is beginning to feel like the rushed bits.  <br />
<br />
I need to give it more time, but at the moment still re-exploring EQ.  First is still the best in many regards.  I never really got why people got so rhapsodic about WOW.  All the game mechanics are pretty much the same no matter what you play.  Wow had fast leveling, good tradeskills that then got stupid at high levels when for the first time intensive faction grinding got thrown in out of the blue, and a pretty stylized design.  Game lore was fine and all but it never really excited me much.  <br />
<br />
Plus no halflings.  I hate having no halflings!  A magic cow just didn't cut it for me!<br />
<br />
Anyway, nice to hear from you!</div></div><hr />
