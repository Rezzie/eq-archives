<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garriern Dracos</div><div class="date">03-10-2009, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a level 70 druid/Shaman combo and was wondering if anyone had any ideas on a good AA XP spot and what sort of tactics?<br />
 <br />
I have access to all expansions and level appropriate mercs (helaer and tank) if necessary.<br />
 <br />
At the moment I tend to use Drangonscale Hills and do the Fenden quests and the doombug killing quest to add to the normal killing of mobs. I tend to stick to the bugs, cats, wolves and snakes with merc tank (ds,buffs) and shaman/druid dots. the Xp is good but I wondered if anyone had any better ideas for the duo.<br />
 <br />
Both have 120aa's and have mostly elegant/eleborate armour with the odd 200hp+ drop from newer expansion in non-visible slots. I would like to hit 200aa's before moving to 71+</div></div><hr />

CoD was great XP when I was 60-65.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I managed to kill some of the animals because they are gimp but I ran into a mother bear of some sort with very strange behaviour - would follow the druid like a puppy but ate my shaman in 4 or 5 easy morsels (and he is a big ogre). so I sort of chickened out and went back to DsH hahaha!<br />
 <br />
I think I will stay in DsH for a while longer and grind the AA's and then another level then go look at OGH again. Would love the aug and obviously the progression through the voids would be nice if only for access to the higher mercs.<br />

Thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />
