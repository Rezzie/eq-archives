<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demasia</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read the following in another thread:<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;So, yes, a druid can singlehandedly keep CS clear of wyverns, but, a group can do it far faster...which is one of the reasons the few groups I have seen there don't stick around long. They kill so fast and the respawn is slow, they usually end up sitting on their hands with nothing to do, thus they usually end up leaving.[/quote]<br />
I read the statement and reflected upon how significant respawn time has been to my experience with EQ in the last four and half years.  In a couple years, many players will only have known EQ with instanced dungeons.  But for many of us now, our experience in EQ has been largely shaped by competition for scarce resources.  Decent experience camps have been the most fiercely contested and limited in supply of the resources. <br />
<br />
I realize that many people created druids, necros, bards, wizards or &lt;insert class&gt; because they wanted to be able to solo, but that isn't true for everyone.  Remember when rotting, quadding and kiting were not even elements of our vernacular?  I have no doubt that we would have discovered that different means to solo effectively under all circumstances, but I am equally confidant that we would not have had so many people create solo classes later on under different circumstances.  I remember wondering if it was possible to kill a Snared Griffawn using my superior speed and most mana efficient spell.  It wasn't a matter of knowing it could be done and doing it that way because that was what my class did.  I remembering pulling 2 dorfs in BB to see if I could kill them using my otherwise never used AE spell (I think I died in the first 2 attempts to the LDs that I used to suffer so frequently back then).  I did it out of curiosity because the game was still in it's age of discovery.<br />
<br />
It didn't take long to realize though that soloing was more efficient than grouping.  I would argue that it wasn't the &quot;solo&quot; class strengths that resulted in that inevitable truth, but it was the mob spawn times.  I believe that many of the game's issues linger today because of spawn times that are simply far too long.  Would the solo exp nerf and group bonus adjustment been &quot;needed&quot; if groups could actually benefit from their synergy that allows them to be more powerful than 6 individuals?  Was it any wonder that solo exp was better when groups have to sit idle and wait time and time again to find something else to pull?<br />
<br />
The absurd length of spawn times were the catalyst that made groups less efficient at gaining exp for six than a soloist could achieve.  Sadly, I believe the lengthy spawn times have always been an intentional means of limiting the amount of exp that a group could earn in a time period.  In creating the artificial time sinks, someone must've forgotten that it is not fun sitting and waiting for the puller to find another mob.  Had spawn times been managed to allow groups to actually benefit from their collective strength, I don't believe we would have half the number of druids that remain playing today and I believe that other classes wouldn't give a hoot about other classes being able to solo.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it is nuts that some zones still have nineteen minute respawn times.  It was nuts that they ever did.  Imagine how easy it would have been to reduce spawn times to a third of what they are now.  Imagine how efficient grouping would be if the puller didn't have run to distances beyond the group exp range to find a mob.<br />
<br />
Solo experience was better because of the efficiency an individual enjoys in dealing with the spawn times.  The recent changes did not give groups the opportunity to maximize their efficiency and earn better experince than a soloist; the changes simply nerfed solo experience and gifted more experience to groups.  It still is not fun sitting and waiting for a pull in a group.  It is still more exciting to be able to push yourself to your optimal limits soloing.<br />
<br />
Fix the spawn times!  Yes, I say &quot;fix&quot;.  The very nature of grouping assumes greater cooperative output than what is achievable by the same individuals operating independantly.  The spawn times hinder groups from being efficient.</div></div><hr />

Well, yes.  You could kill non-stop with a group and still not make what someone soloing casually could make.  So there was no real incentive to group.  In fact, there was a disincentive to group if you could solo decently.  If you could solo amazingly well, like bards have done, then grouping would be about the last thing you'd want to do.  Not only that, but with a group you have to share the loot.   Grouping needed an enormous incentive increase just to make it attractive based on the inconvience factors, like gathering up people, enduring their untimely AFK's, having them leave or just being idiots.  I think, if everyone could solo, they probably would.   Even now, on my  baby bard, I don't want to group with anyone.  Even though I know I could level faster, I just want to solo.  Part of that is because I like having the downtime between solo's to do stuff that needs to get done.  The other part is, I'm leveling fast enough as it is!  In fact, leveling so fast I get new levels before I can even afford to buy my new songs.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I think the respawn timers are generally too slow.  For both regular mobs and boss mobs.  The one thing that they haven't really tuned in EQ, not even as the servers got more crowded, or as people got better at killing stuff, was the respawn timers.   So as a level of the game gets more and more crowded, then the timers become an even bigger problem.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are times when having a really fast respawn would be very bad.  Like when you need to clear a difficult area to get to another area.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's SORTA true.  I wish they'd shorten them a bit more too, but they have in fact changed in expansions.<br />

Hrmm.. call me crazy but isn't SoL (Shadows of &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Luclin&lt;/span&gt;) the same thing as Luclin? or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />

Actually, I don't think Verant expected people to camp so much...i.e., sit in one place and have a puller go out and bring mobs to the camp spot.   From their early statements, they expected us to go wandering around hunting for mobs.   If anything, the longish respawn times were an intentional means of getting peoples to move on.<br />
<br />
Verant clearly underestimated the ability of people to put up with tedium.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When your group had to sit around for two or more minutes after each kill, you didn't need the mob to spawn as fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">L1ndara</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 19 minute spawn time wasn't bad for tough mobs, the problem really came about because players got so powerful that fights became 30 seconds or less and there was no reason to fight anything but the weakest mobs you could find.  The fix to XP near the end of Luclin giving a more proper amount of XP for high level mobs fixed much of this problem by making it worth your time to fight mobs that were actually tough and took some time to kill instead of killing the lowest blue you could find which would vapourize if you looked at them funny.<br />
 <br />
  Boss mobs of course respawn way to fricken infrequently.  A lot of servers have 5+ guilds in elemental and 2+ in time now, it's such a mess, but it's been like that since the start.</div></div><hr />
