OH I AM SO HOPING that they are replacing the current horse faced woodelves. Does anyone know if that is the plan? Like Luclin expansion, new models?

Edit:  Here's an article (http://pc.ign.com/articles/504/504386p1.html?fromint=1) on the update, in general, with pics of the rat and bat.  I'll try to find the other article.  It may have been a fan faire report.</div></div><hr />

First they were going to be out by (last) Christmas.  Then it was before OoW.  I think the most recent quote was from Smedley at the summit, saying not to expect them before the end of this year (2004.)</div></div><hr />

hehe, remember the modelers did that bald gnome first.  Then they just used their 3D/CG sculpting knives to mold those into all the other faces of Norrath.<br />

I'd imagine that if they are doing new models they're going to have to redo all of the animations anyway unless the skeletal structure and size of the mesh over the top are very similar. I'd hope so anyway :)</div></div><hr />

I am so spoiled now. I am hoping that maybe we will get some options such as SWG characters. I can change every feature on the face,hair and body when creating. It is just plain amazing and so far, no other game compares...although it looks like EQ2 will.<br />

But in SWG there is such an amazing variety of clothes it is wonderful.. HOWEVER, the content is just not anywhere near EQ's. One year of SWG and I am bored with it. I played EQ from day one and only got bored last year and now I am back and in awe of all the new stuff. So much I have yet to explore and do. Wish they would combine the best of both and hopefully they will in EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi all. First time posting here, so be kind =)<br />
<br />
Just wanted to say Moonwing, that the new graphics changes that were introduced (ie DX 9) are actually meant to reduce the amount of system resources that EQ uses, so with new character models, not only will you get awesome new graphics, but your system should actually run EQ better as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, that's the theory - we just need to see it in practice! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loral</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked Smedley about the new models and he confirmed that we would have new player models before the end of the year.  SOE outsourced player model development to an outside group and when one of the artists for SOE saw them his reply was &quot;wow&quot;.   While SOE artists would love to do them themselves, they aparently are pleased with the outside job.<br />
<br />
These new models should be developed using new techniques to improve performance, not hinder it.  This may require a DirectX 9 video card, however.  Its some sort of skeletal modeling or animation or some other gnomish nonsense.  All I know is that they are supposed to look and perform better.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they won't be half broken like the Luclin models are.  I still can't sit right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vikken</div><div class="date">07-12-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't wait, these graphic upgrades are what keep EQ alive to new players. I would have never started playing when I did if the luclin models hadn't been in, the old models were just too old, if cute.<br />
<br />
Now if we can just get the artists back in those old zones polishing the old graphics, nothing fancy, just a little extra. As much as I love the old zones (/wave kelethin) they are starting to look very dated. I'd be really nice if they just went back and smoothed some of the zone models, sharpened the textures a bit, and added some more &quot;mood&quot; lighting to bring those old zones up to date while maintaining there original flavor.</div></div><hr />

I actually didn't mind it on the old models, but on the new ones something just looks... wrong.  Besides, it seems underdressed to go into combat with a bikini when everyone else is head-to-toe metal.<br />
<br />
I still wear Elysian not because I can't get something better, but because I can't get something better that isn't leather.  =)</div></div><hr />

Sure, that is the theory.<br />
<br />
But the DX9 made the game run worse.  I don't care about what my toon looks like.<br />
<br />
What I care about is when I zone into a zone and I can't do anything because everything staggers.<br />

Noone drive a model T on hte highway in rush our traffic and the complains about how highway speed limits and better cars make driving you model T difficuly (and dangerous).<br />
<br />
EQ is no different, it evolves over time to take advantage of new technologies and strives to compete with the latest MMOs on the market. Are you suggesting we should still be using the old EQ classic graphics? I dare EQ would have a lot less appeal to new players if it had stayed with the old engine. I for one probably wouldn't have bothered. Graphics are an important part of immersion for many people. % year old graphics do not do that and niether do 2 year old graphics.<br />
<br />
Upgrade your system or quit complaining about not being able to run the game on your 5 year old computer. Hardware is cheap and readily available for a quick and painless upgrade. You'd probably find that you enjoy EQ more if you woud just upgrade instead of complaining about the devs trying to make EQ better.</div></div><hr />

Well, since it is so cheap for you, why don't you just send me some new hardware?<br />

Let's look at this from Sony themselves:<br />

<br />
I have a system that is much better than the Required Specs and even meets the Recommended Specs and with all graphics options turned to the lowest level, I still am staggering around in some zones.<br />
<br />
Don't go telling me my system is at fault.  Just because you can afford to buy a new system every year, don't blame me.<br />
<br />
Sony set the Specs, not me.  When my system meets the Recommended Specs and I have all graphics at the lowest settings and the game still is unplayable, it isn't my fault.<br />
<br />
And my system is set up correctly with all current drivers and settings set properly and hard drive defragged and all that, if you were about to go into that.<br />
<br />
(edited when I realized that not only was my system much better than the Required Specs but even meets the Recommended Specs)</div></div><hr />

Making characters in SWG is just awesome, awesome, awesome. I have more fun creating characters than playing the now very boring game. Kind of like playing with those barbie dolls lol.<br />
 <br />
I have a master dancer as one of my SWG characters and she is drop dead gorgeous. She has drop dead, sexy clothes too. I mean VERY VERY sexy clothes. I actually had houses with nothing but clothes in them lol. AND, that is coming to EQ2....gets the expectations flowing. I can hardly wait to play a game with substance AND awesome character models. A link to one of my characters and the city I built...which is awesome too. However, once you have done all this, there is just no more adventure left as in EQ. If SWG and EQ could be merged OMG. I am so hoping that is what EQ2 is going to be all about.<br />
