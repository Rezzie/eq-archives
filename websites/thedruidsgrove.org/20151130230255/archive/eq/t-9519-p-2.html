 <br />
Before zoning in FM here is what I had or didn't have on my character:<br />
1) Had Epic 1.0 not equipped, in a bag<br />
2) Had Seed of Wrath<br />
3) Had LOIO part from the foragers<br />
4) Had Forage from RM<br />
5) Didn't have the Waterproof bag<br />
6) The Goblin Hiders were not on the top of my tracking list when I zoned in. 4 of them where around 20th position or so. Think they were already there when I arrived.<br />
 <br />
I zoned in FM from BW and started tracking to find 4 Goblin Hiders (deep blue con for L67) on track.<br />
I followed the track till when it reversed direction (I had Mask of stalker so I saw invis).<br />
I reversed track till again, a sudden shift 180 degrees direction.. then I thought it was porting or hiding from me.<br />
I decided then to continue straight forward from my previous direction and found 4 of them bunched up on the top of a Mountain at LOC: <br />
Neg 2145 Neg 2983. I decided to root pull one from far away and all 3 others ran for me. They can be snared and rooted and don't summon.<br />
I killed my 1st one and the body poofed with only faction ajustments and no xps...<br />
I then tracked 15 !!!<br />
I decided to check another direction with same method.. continue when it's changing track direction.<br />
I ended up seeing them on the top of a tower at LOC: Neg 3000 Pos 80 and needed to Levitate to get to them. They appear to fall from the sky. <br />
Since I had to be closer, I saw them say something when aggro:<br />
 <br />
Funny as hell, the WRONG one says &quot;Hah! you stupid! Me not real hider!&quot;<br />
 <br />
So when I got that message, I parked it with root and snare. Pulled about 6 like this when one of them didn't say a word. Killed it, got xps and got my:<br />
Bag of diseased Maiden's hair<br />
ID is: Small bag containing a handful of sick plants.<br />
 <br />
After I killed the real one, even 30mins after sharing this info in the channel, I still see 15 Goblin Hiders on track on my server Quellious.<br />
 <br />
I hope this helps out.<br />

They forget about this contest for a while, then suddenly one of them remembers. Fights break out for a while over who will win the [prize] then they forget again until the next one remembers it. I wish they'd have this contest already and get it over with.' <br />
<br />
Finrin Talister says 'I don't know who it was, just someone that they caught sneaking into or out of Droga. You know, I'm tempted to dress up like a goblin and insist that they start the contest already, just so it will be over and we can go back to the relative peace and quiet I've learned to enjoy out here.' <br />

Sounds like this may be an event that can be spawned as well as occasionally happens on it's own...</div></div><hr />

I was doing some looking around at eqtraders to see if they had any reports of some forages of interest to us and discovered that the Sickly Maiden's Hair could also be foraged in Maiden's Eye. <br />
<br />
I'll confirm this this evening when I get home. I hope this adds something to the quest.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
With the previous information of the goblin foragers in the Lake of Ill Omen and the new information of the goblin hiders in Frontier Mountains, it appears &quot;the pattern&quot; could be the relationship between variations of diseased maiden hairs and goblins.<br />
 <br />
FM and LOIO are connected zones, hence &quot;spreading out from one point&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Similar to the ranger epic who had to forage the diseased maiden hairs from Rathe Mountains to get their &quot;sample collection&quot; container in SFG, I think looking for forages and fishes is going in the wrong direction. All of the rangers' samples were blood from various animals, conincidentally mostly in Kunark. The forage in RM appears only to be a key in getting your sample-collection container and no more than that. I think the main focus should be looking for or finding out ways to scout out 2 more named or odd goblins that drop a variation of &quot;diseased maiden hairs&quot; as the goblin hider in FM and the goblin forager in LOIO. It would appear we should be looking for goblins in zones connected to or in the vacinity of FM and LOIO.</div></div><hr />

Knew I should not have logged off and just called in sick.  The goblin theory is alive and well :)  Lets keep our eyes open for a goblin maiden.  This is all going to at some point to a source of the corruption and I am not sure if it will be some tainted object or an actual creature.<br />

As to triggering the Hiders, I wonder how you do it.  Did you at anytime activate the goblin disguise?</div></div><hr />

If the number is really blank, say so.  I see so many people come back and fill in blanks because the other person didnt' think it was related or something.  It would help us all if the list was unaltered and we were allowed to form our own conclusions.</div></div><hr />

i spent 3 hours+ in ME today. eqtraders.com is wrong, wrong wrong.<br />
nothing unusual in ME forage list, i asked couple other foragers aswell. please prove me wrong, we might just have had horrible bad luck. but i do seriously believe that their incorrect data is simply because of the name of the item, and the name of the zone. in reality they are not related.</div></div><hr />

Finrin Talister says 'They've been a real problem lately. Not that they aren't always a problem, but there was all this commotion about some sort of contest with a prize a while ago. It seems that they've [forgotten] it again for the moment, thank goodness.'<br />

Finrin Talister says 'I don't know for sure what the prize is, I don't speak goblin all that well. All I know is that they discovered something on some poor [victim] that they desire. I'm not certain that they even know what it is from the way they talk about it.'<br />

1. Make the disguise.<br />

3. Find &amp; kill a hider to get your drop.<br />
4. When the King says the event is over, go give him the Maiden Hair.<br />

Like I said not sure if this is old, new, or not for us. But maybe goblins spawn that we need to kill for epic item, or maybe if we free her we get something shes found while being captured. Just throwing this out there. Hope it might help.</div></div><hr />

Who are the last NPC's we deal with in our original epic?  several other 1.5's started where the others left off, maybe ours does too?  Assuming that this path we're already on is a false or is a step ahead of where we should be...<br />

 <br />
After spawning the group of Goblin Hiders there is a very simple way to kill them, i'd suggest just getting a few dots out and keep epic 1 handy incase you get adds (giants and stuff).<br />
 <br />
After they pop on track, run to loc -3000, 75. They all hit for around 150ish, double hitting at most. So be careful if you arent buffed! Now run onto a hill adjacent to the building with SoE on for lev. Run up to the top and stay on the top of the wall, pull it using snare and run back to where you were.  Keep in mind:  One will spawn when you first find them, pull that then a few seconds later a few more will drop from the sky, then a few more.  If you evac and go back, just one will be standing there<br />
 <br />
If it is the real goblin it will say, &quot;Your dead corpse will soon line my pockets with gold!&quot;<br />
 <br />
If its the fake goblin it will say, &quot;Hah! You stupid! Me not real hider!&quot;<br />
 <br />
This might sound kind of weird...if it is a fake goblin, root the one you just pulled and keep pulling more til you get a message for a real one. If you can indeed pick out which one is the real one, root him far away then any of the others and evac to zone line.<br />
 <br />
Now run back to the building, lev up, and run to the top. The one sitting there is all alone and will be the real one! Pull and nuke away, it'll take about 10 nukes or so to kill him using Winter's Frost. Good luck!</div></div><hr />

After getting my one killed, I headed to another spawn point to kill one for a guildmate. I watched a single &quot;goblin hider&quot; turn into 3 (sitting right next to it invis), then the 2 despawned, and reappeared, and when they left again I clicked off invis, the 1 aggrod on me, and sure enough, if was the real one - told me my corpse would line his pockets with gold etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The edges:  Lake Rathe, Everfrost, Felwithe, Sol a-b-c, etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;... I am worried about this cold sickness..&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds like Everfrost to me....<br />
<br />
&quot;...that I can almost taste....<br />
<br />
Snow?  What else cold can you taste?<br />
<br />
I know people have checked Everfrost already... but how about underwater there?<br />
<br />
I don't think these clues are for nada... I'm gonna head back to Everfrost.  Those are the only concrete clues there are.  Besides SOE said that MANY quests have been added.  I think that the sickly maiden's hair etc are for a quest... just not the druid epic.  I also believe that the 2.0 quest is going to be insanely hard and possibly include PoTime.  Maybe the cold area in Time?  Anyone check that?<br />
<br />
Also... Allakhazam has only published the portion of the quest where  you talk to Athelle.  Though many other &quot;clues&quot; have been posted.. including the container from the chick in Surefall... Alla has not posted that bit.  That leads me to the conclusion (personally), that that is not a part of the epic, but yet another one of the many quests that arrived with OoW.  Alla is only going to post what is confirmed/true.  They have had time to confirm the sickly maiden hair/surefall chick etc.  Yet, it has not been added as a part of the druid epic on their site.<br />

Well, we do know Athele starts the quest because if you DO NOT have epic she basicaly tells you to go away and let others handle the problem (referring directly to epic holders, this is a confirmed fact)<br />
So we ARE on the right track, we just seem to have a harder time figuring ours out.<br />

I think that the druid epic has not come to fruition because we may have been searching in the wrong places.  Athelle's response to the sickly maiden hair seems to be a clue.  She says it's not familiar to her and could or could not be something to worry about.<br />
<br />
Athelle gives us clues.  I think we should take her clues about the edges and the cold.  And go from there.  I just don't think the sickly maiden hair is part of the druid epic.  She talks of an illness... not a disease...  I know I may be picky... but I think we're not headed down the right path here and that is why nothing concrete has been found yet.<br />
<br />
I could be totally wrong, I accept that fact.  The sickly maidens hair and the way things are going just doesn't sync with me...<br />

I'll keep probing to see what  I can come up with.... to bring fact to my theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zephaus</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to the Frontier Mountains event, just a suggestion based on my experience tonight -- make sure to warn the lower level folks in the zone that the event is about to start.  In our case, the event lasted more than a norrath day, and the number of goblins running about the zone quickly killed a number of folks and made it difficult to get corpses recovered.<br />
<br />
Also, we did the event twice.  The first time, it wasn't really clear what happened.  It appeared that only one Hider spawned, and he was killed immediately but either the corpse poofed or he warped just before death and died somewhere far away from us (it's possible he didn't die; but he was dotted and near death when he vanished; however, a GM said he could not verify in the logs that the MOB had died).  I wasn't grouped with the turn-in person at the time, and did the killing, so perhaps there was an issue about not being grouped with the person doing the turn in.  Or maybe the number of hider's that spawns is random?  Or maybe the hiders were just so good at their job that no one could find them.  Three of us looked until the event was called off, though, and could not find any more Hiders after that first encounter.<br />
<br />
The second time we grouped together, and it went pretty much as everyone else has described.  The hiders would warp around a good bit.  I don't know if that is intended as part of the hide and seek nature of the game or what.  Was a fun hunt.  <br />
<br />
Thanks to Meagan for doing the combines and turn-ins :)</div></div><hr />

heres were ure wrong alla is not the end all be all tdg and eqdruids are hands down the best sorce for information on up and coming druid quest allas only prints what they have been feed  and we are pritty sure that all of what we are doing is right becuase <br />
A first mob u need epic 1.0 to speak with at all and she refers u to chick in SFG in which u need sickly maidens hair to get hte container<br />
<br />
B all of the loots have fallen in line with the item that we got the continer with although the zones dont corospond RM for forage (FM was taken off a travaler) (loio was scavanged) <br />
<br />
meaning i think were looking in the wrong place atm i think we need to look in fear i heard of a new mob up a vermicultered guardian that suposedly when u loose a fight aginst him says somin along the lines of were the coruption (epic 1) failed diease will prevail(epic 1.5??) i am not even remotly sure on this guild cleared fear today to no avail i will keep a eye but everyone needs to expand awayfrom the loio idea i think weve checked kunark to no end. btw  :banghead:  how come druids get a hard as hell quest all the rest of the ones ive been reading they were given some clues that actuly realated to there quest  :(</div></div><hr />

That being said<br />
 <br />
&lt;So Maybe for kunark you will need to collect 4 maidens hair speciman, an dthen after you turn in that you will get some sort of other bag and a hint on the next Zone you need to go to&gt;Maybe the waterproof was just to help hint you towrd kunark, and the It will spread from a central zone was to just tell you once you find the Maidens HAir on Kunark stay in Kunark. But that is just my guess&gt;<br />
 <br />
I think that evrything found out so far points to Kunark being the first Continent to search we have found Dieased Maidens Hair in Two zones LoIo and FM and both happen to be from goblins, one that is under water and one that was hiding, Is it so far of a strecth to think that the other two drops for the bag will be Some sort of Maidens Hair, Will drop off of some sort of Goblin, and The goblin will be found in a Kunark zone, <br />
 <br />
I am sure the SoE is throwing out so red hearings and maybe also be eludeing to latter parts of the quest liek the edge and cold stuff.<br />
 <br />
IMO it would be best to Focus on Goblins and Kunark but that is only my opinon there is a ton of zones with goblins in kunark</div></div><hr />

Next step is most likely droga, the sickness was gotten off a mob there. New spawn in droga  and event spawner, inolving baby disesed spiders. Drop from the zone in travel down tunnel to 1st room, right hand second gobbo is the PH&gt; dont know if its triggered or is on a timer.<br />
<br />
Most likely, we are working toward the source of the sickness. Its probably a spider. Spider had babies, babies infested Droga, gobbo got sickness from them.<br />

You hand derrick goodroot Unkempt Seed Rituals<br />

Derrick Goodroot says ' You actually found it. It has a new cover, but most of the original pages seem to be here. I can't read all of this very well. Nobody reads this language anymore, but I think I understand the basics. You will need some high quality loam and some magic earth. Marshes are a good place to find the loam. Magical soil might be a problem, but certainly you can find some that will work. These two items are used to create the cleansing loam. It's the third item that I don't like. The ritual seems to say that you must take the seed and insert it into the heart of a noble creature to give it strength, then rest that in the loam and earth. I don't like the idea of killing anything noble for such a ritual. I'm not sure what I think of this whole thing now. I'll leave that up to you. Here is a pot that you can use for the ritual. If you still want to do this and you find a heart that might work, bring it to me and I'll see if I can help.<br />

<br />
1. Droga - capture a bloated spider <br />
2. CT - capture a sickly mosquito <br />
3. SG - capture a twitching swordfish <br />
4. Chardok B -capture a leprous chokidai   <br />
5. Veksar - Kill an Astetotic Highborn <br />
6. Western Wastes - Kill neuralgic huntress <br />
<br />
Druids have a 4 slot container to fill, so two-three zones may not be needed (for this part of the epic). <br />
<br />
Perhaps we should look at only adjacent zones to the ranger epic mobs. <br />
<br />
1. Droga-FM (goblin hiders) <br />
2. CT-Feerott (or RM?) <br />
3. SG-WW or CS <br />
4. Chardok B-Chardok (or BW, depending on whether B is considered a separate zone or a 'sub' zone) <br />
5. Veksar-LOIO (bloodgill foragers) <br />
6. Western Wastes-ToV, DN, SG <br />
<br />
My (unproven) Theory: <br />
Disease started as a cure (from Upper Guk) to rid the evilness in Innothule Swamp but caused harm instead of good. <br />
<br />
A. The sickness spread from Innothule Swamp to Feerott (*need to discover which zone* - if applicable) and also appeared in RM (foraged item turned in to Niera). <br />
B. and affected the mosquitos in CT. <br />
<br />
C. The mosquitoes in CT infected the Chokidai in Chardok B (mosquitoes go everywhere). <br />
D. A sarnak in either Chardok or BW killed and ate the Chokidai and got sick. (*need to discover which zone*- if applicable) <br />
<br />
E. The Sarnak was the intruder to Droga and was the sickness was the prize on the Goblin Hiders in FM. <br />
F. The Bloated Spiders in Droga got the sickness. <br />
<br />
G. The Bloodgill Foragers in LOIO gathered the sick plants (disease spread from FM to LOIO through the ground). <br />
H. Lastly, the sickness affected the Astetotic Highborn in Veksar (who ate goblin foragers from LOIO). <br />
<br />
* * * <br />
My best guess is that we need to scour through BW/Chardok and Innothule Swamp/Feerott. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good theory - I also suggested scouting Sarnaks, but my theory was a bit different. <br />
<br />
Let's say the disease was actually a weapon to get rid of the Goblins.. so the intruder was caught before planting it. Now, the enemies of Goblins are Sarnaks, Iksars and Giants. Iksars worship CT so it might make sense that they would get a disease from CT to kill the Goblins. orrrr, it could come from the iksar.<br />
<br />
Also, the disease might originate from the realm of Discord which has completely taken over the world of Kuua (OoW) and is starting to take over Norrath via Taelosia (GoD).<br />
<br />
I like your theory though, Tyleza.. it would make sense it would start as a cure to something maybe even originating in Kuua/Discord too.<br />
<br />
My best guess is that we need to scour through BW/Chardok and Innothule Swamp/Feerott. <br />
I would also suggest to check the Sarnak fort in LoIO for clues. Keep in mind that we have checked for ground spawns, so I would think you need to kill multiple mobs around these zones to check for evidence of the disease via AE or just solo or something.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'll keep trying to see what I can come up with.<br />

The river sources and water sources were the VERY FIRST thing that was checked when we found the foragers and when we saw the name &quot;waterproof&quot; in the bag.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
What if we are dealing with the backstory of epic 1.0? Meaning we are now dealing with the disease or diseases that caused the Corrupted mobs.<br />
 <br />
RM forage was proof of the Corrupted Hill Giant.<br />
LoIO was proof of the Corrupted Barracuda.<br />
As for FM....we now know that Niera Farbreeze's mother died of disease.  In 1.0, we gave a Human Skeleton a painting of Niera, which leads me to believe that had to be her mother's remains.  Thus dieing of a disease in FM, another place we found a diseased piece.<br />
 <br />
Should we look at other zones? Well....yes.  But not immediately.  I think we are going to find a differant disease for each continent that caused our need to Cleanse each in our 1st epic.....or at least a cause of it.<br />
 <br />
In other words...in my theory....<br />
Epic 1.0 = dealing with the threat of corrupted mobs<br />
Epic 1.5 = dealing with the threat of the disease/diseases<br />
Epic 2.0 = dealing with the threat of the Disease Creator (Bert, Inny...?)<br />
 <br />
On another note....seeing how the disease was found by an event in FM, we should start looking for other event type of clues.  And as we seen from the new named Unicorn in EJ someone mentioned being untrackable (not saying its related or not) we may need to do a bit of actual exploring than just looking at track findings.<br />

Theory: A bag of it was found on hider quest. Maybe thats the 4th piece and the rest are just handfulls that spread out from the contest.

<br />
What is the Lore on Niera in Surefall? The quote I'm noticing is this one from Athele:<br />
<br />
&quot;...Niera in Surefall. She has been studying diseases ever since her mother's tragic death from disease.&quot;<br />
<br />
 So, Niera lost her mother to desease. Which desease? Who created THAT desease? What is the story behind Niera? If we know this info it might help us establish a pattern of connection to the one who originated the desease (or cure).<br />
<br />
My general theory is Sony wants us to become more familiar with the Lore of EQ. Force us to learn our history, so to speak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calrain</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a feeling that the theory behind finding the source of the illness behind the corruption of our first epic is what we're looking at. BUT what Neira is looking for is evidence so we still need to collect that to finish the bag portion. Keep in mind, we've been focussing on just maiden hair related to goblins, but there may be other 'evidence' as well. <br />
 <br />
Rarely if ever in any 'investigation' is there ever strictly one type of clue or evidence in defining the case, so I think we need to look at something that ties the person or thing that was sneaking into droga in with the disease, perhaps a vial or some other small item. I also think that finding the critters in Ill Omen first was just a fluke, I think it stems from Droga/FM, down through Ill Omen, into FV. <br />
 <br />
So I think we now need to be looking at someone who has a grudge against the goblins in Kunark in particular, perhaps a new or old NPC in FV that like in the reference to the fish, was looking to do good by cleansing the area of goblins. FV is a 'good' city, theoretically a bastion of good in a veritable wasteland of evil (Sarnak, Goblins, Trak, Iksar)<br />
 <br />
This of course is all speculation, but the direction others have been taking by focussing just on the goblins and the maiden's hair just don't seem to 'feel' right to me. Call it a hunch. I'm at work so can't do any of this investigation myself, but perhaps there's some other evidence near Fay's spawn point or the corrupted gorrila's spawn point (ground spawns) that need to be collected as evidence as well.<br />
 <br />
Might be that we need to go to each of the continents ala the first epic to collect further evidence once we gather and complete the kunark evidence. <br />

'See if you can find other infected plants or any other evidence of this infection.<br />

Note the bit in bold ......<br />
<br />
I was looking in lucys for anything else like diseased, poisned, sickly, poor, ill, etc but aint had anything jump out that strikes me as obvious.  <br />

Its hard to say, but would it even be a plant ? <br />
It would stick with the whole plant thing so far..... but 'other evidence', would kinda indicate something not of a plant nature as it specifically says 'infected plants' OR...... odd.<br />

PS - Also Nimchip and Galen (sorry if i spelt it wrong just going off of memory after reading TONS of messages) You might want to add in your summary about how the foragers spawn in LoIO. I thought i would go get the loot off them before getting my bag and waited for 2 hours before i found another druid had come that had the bag and spawned them. So it wouldn't do any good to not go without the bag. Also on my first attempt my DS and Regen dropped after the first 2 minutes and without Kazads and under 3k of hps they killed me. I came back to try again and retreave my corpse and they had despawned. The druid that had spawned them had left after they spawned and no others were in the zone to possibly attack them between me dieing and corpse running. I just thought it might be helpfull to add that you must have the bag to spawn the foragers and they despawn if not killed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiters</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm thinking lately that the goblin drops are part of the epic quest, but later on where we need to go find the source of this sickness (the goblins). I strongly believe that our next step as druids is to kill some animals around the world that might be targets for parasites, or might have started out as parasites and changed because they 'are trying to clean the wrong kind of things off the fish.&quot; I believe the pirannah meat is 1/4 of the pieces that go into the bag. I think anything else that eats fish, or any sort of fish like a pirannah or shark or swordfish is a potential target for the first part of this quest.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
&quot; Some great druids and scholars have told me that diseases can start out as helpful things, like parasite fish that clean other fish. But sometimes they change and become harmful. Sometimes they are trying to be helpful but cause harm because they are trying to clean the wrong kind of things off the fish &quot;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The fact is, epic 2.0 was a BIG advertising point for OOW. There is no way SOE would forget to put a drop or a forage into the game for epic 2.0s. This is one of the few quests I'm sure they tested. Furthermore, this NPC text is written for a reason. At first, I thought maybe this whole fish talk was just an analogy, as did many others. But, when SoE has to write clues into 1 or 2 paragraphs, you have to really pay attention to what is said. <br />
 <br />
Next, a lot are convinced that Frontier Mountains or Rathe mountains are the &quot;starting point,&quot; and that the &quot;disease must spread out from here.&quot; However, read Niera's text. She clearly indicates that she's not sure where the starting point is, but once she knows where it is, it might be helpful to her.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Niera Farbreeze says 'See if you can find other infected plants or any other evidence of this infection. If you can find enough of them, you may be able to see a pattern. It should spread out from one point. Knowing the first location might help me a lot in trying to discover what this gunk started out as, which parasite fish it is, so-to-speak&quot;<br />
 <br />
For this reason, I think the FM goblin lead is more believeable than the RM lead as &quot;the starting point.&quot; However, I think FM is going to come in later because the drops are &quot;Handful of diseased maiden's hair&quot; and &quot;Bag of diseased maiden's hair.&quot; Judging by the old epic quests, and patterns in general, this first collection is going to be 4 things with similar names. Piranna meat, maybe swordfish meat? Shark meat? Barracuda meat? Later on, we'll find the &quot;Handful of hair&quot;, which we follow to FM for the &quot;bag of hair&quot;, and finally to Droga for &quot;sickly maiden seeds&quot; or something.<br />
 <br />
I would not rule out any zones. I think the best zones to go to next are Kedge Keep, Siren's Grotto, Cobalt Scar, maybe Swamp of no hope? Anythign with a decently challenging mob, but soloable. Remember, this is just the 3rd step in the epic 1.5, and we need to find some evidence there is even sickness before we can place the blame on the goblins. <br />
 <br />
If you get any meat, please do me a favor and post it here along with any lore you see.<br />

<br />
To be honest I'm surpised that so many people are posting about random things when we have leads to follow.  Who was the intruder?  I know this has been said but it bares repeating.  We must figure out who the intruder is, why did they bring the diseased hair to the goblins?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idaila</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chlorodesmis is a green filamentous algae whose appearance is similar to thin blades of grass or tufts of hair. Its common names include Maiden's Hair Plant and Turtle Grass. It contains a toxic substance which deters herbivorous fish from eating it. However, hermit crabs may consume this plant if there is insufficient algae present in the aquarium.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
I can't remember if anyone has posted a description of Maiden's hair plant, if not, this is it. <br />
 <br />
It's an aquatic plant that herbivorous (plant eating) fish won't eat...what about Carnivorous?<br />
 <br />
I was thinking the theory about the disease beginning in FM was really close to being correct, but now with this information, I wonder. Unless, the person who brought the disease was from a place with water, and purposely brought this in to sicken the goblins. <br />
 <br />
Thought a bit of info about the plant might help. I've been looking up the religious and mythical history of this plant, but have yet to find anything substantial. I'll keep looking.<br />
 <br />
I was also thinking...maybe we should look at the amount of the plant we're finding in each area... A BAG, indicating a large amount, A HANDFUL, indicating maybe a smaller amount than a bag, but definitely more than a Tuft. Maybe the amount of hair found can indicate the trail of the infection.<br />

I think the story is going to be that we 1) Find evidence of disease (through carnivorous fish or parasites like ice burrowers) 2) Get the goblin forager piece and hand it in, that will relate the goblins to this evildoing and 3) go after the goblins.<br />

 Again, this is my theory and what I will try. If you disagree, just don't try this approach.<br />

To clarify that he did not want those augments, the item I handed him was a Voidflow stone (an augment/stone dropped in a OoW zone); I know this stone is for the new augment upgrades. What caught my attention was that he said &quot;I study the way earth and stone are formed.&quot; and &quot;I think there's a lot we can learn about this place from the formation of the [native stones].&quot; Since nobody knows to what extent any zone, epseically OoW zones are involved, I thought it was worth investigating for the stone/earth lead. :)<br />

I have heard that new charms or such will pottery crafted using both the taelosian clay ie: chunk of broken stone worker etc, that may be the stone they are referring to, and the other person to speak to would maybe be the npc that teaches you how to refine them...<br />

But yeah don't think offhand he's part of epic.   Have to consider too that if you handed in a voidflow stone when he says it's cruder than what he's used to he might be refering to the other augs which are supposed to technically be more refined (the ones with spell shield and other focuses &amp; hp/mana/end instead of just +stats/resists)</div></div><hr />

That's enough for me to think that we're on the right track.<br />

'This is a lengthy list of details about the effects of Maiden's Hair disease. It describes similarites between the way it affects animals and the way that other diseases manifies. From what you see, there are two facets to the disease. It causes a painfully dry skin condition that often leads to excessive bleeding. The more deadly symptom affects the brain, causing incredible pain in the spine and head. This, Corun speculates, can lead to a shut down of the mind or a form of pain-driven insanity.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JenaWillowfeather</div><div class="date">09-21-2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's very good to know, that carnivorous fish eat Maiden's Hair. <br />
Um, no they don't.  That's the whole point of being carnivorous - you eat meat, not plants.  Also, just because they specify Herbivorous fish don't eat the plant, it doesn't automatically mean any other type of fish eats the plant.  That's like saying that since Druids haven't figured out Epic 1.5, we've solved Epic 2.0.  :p<br />
 <br />
They do, however, make a note that Hermit Crab will eat the grass - and I'm pretty sure Hermit Crabs were a foraged/fished item.  Maybe we should check zones with crabs (lol) extensively for new stuff.<br />
 <br />
Also, the other name for the plant is Turtle Grass.  Tells me that while the grass is toxic to fish, crustaceans and amphibians have no trouble consuming it.  So another thing to watch for, in my book.<br />
 <br />
Someone in the channel mentioned speaking with the Grand Herbalist in Chardok.  Would make sense since you have to kill goblins for the Event - which give positive Chardok faction.  Or even failing that, maybe they're dropping the next form of Maiden's Hair for us.<br />
 <br />
Off the Hair topic, wanted to clear something up.  The (alleged) Vermiculated Guardian in Fear makes a comment about, &quot;where corruption failed, disease will conquer.&quot;  ie: The disease is seperate from the corruption of our first epic.  I do note the similarities of placement in Epic 1.0 and 1.5, so maybe there's a pattern in that we need to look at.  *Shrug*<br />
 <br />
Switching gears again, if the Goblins are involved, there's an interesting bit of lore from the EQRPG PHB's section on the Ages of Norrath.  This quote comes from the age known as, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Rallos Zek's Children,&quot; which details Rallos's war upon the Planes of Power and the creation of the barriers between them. Page nine, paragraph 3, sentences 5 &amp; 6 read as follows:<br />
&quot;Some say that the goblins were also cursed, and that their curse was so terrible and thorough that no one knows what it was to this day.  It is as if an angry and petty god erased the lore from the scrolls and texts of sages.&quot;<br />
Keep in mind that as was pointed out to me, Goblins are children of Brell...which isn't quite true.  The Ankexfen were children of Brell - and the ancestors of the goblins we know today.  Point being, what if Cazic Thule has &quot;promised&quot; to return the Goblins to their former glory in return for doing him this deed?<br />
 <br />
Anyways, I'll make another post when I get home from work in a few hours.  I'm quite long-winded and still have a lot more stuff to say, some of which (I find) is quite interesting.  Hope some of this got people thinking!</div></div><hr />

It just seems like an obvious clue as to a 'trail' that the quest giver talked about. A disease is not a parasite, its a disease caused by a diseased plant. <br />
 <br />
The only clue we have to take us from Droga to somewhere else, is 'intruder' who brought the plant. However, we still need to back track the foragers in LoiO to the RM find. They have to be related, thats where the first find was that Athele accepted.<br />

<br />
Forager holding a handful of diseased maiden's hair suggests to me that the goblins are harvesting this plant, perhaps after finding out about its disease causing properties.<br />
<br />
As to the FM part....what if the hider goblin is a sort of rogue type character (hider --&gt; hide) and a runner/courier of sorts.  Perhaps this hider runs to LOIO and gets the hair from the forager and then brings it back to FM.  People are assuming that the intruder was carrying the pack, perhaps the pack actually belonged to the goblins and the intruder was trying to get it from the goblins. (Maybe it was Niera Farbreeze's mother and she contracted the disease while attempting this)<br />
<br />
A NEW ITEM HAS BEEN FOUND ... SOGGY MAIDEN'S HAIR... dropped in BB (SO FAR NO MOBS KNOWN) <br />
<br />
This confirms my suspicion that this started in BB.  I was tracing backwards and went from LOIO to FV and then while thinking about it, I realized that the other adjacent zone to FV would be BB, where the boat is to Kunark for good races.  A few ideas on where to get this.  BB is full of goblins, look for a new named goblin or a new goblin camp.  Check for quest type NPC's that are new to the zone.  Forage.  Go fishing at the docks....since it's &quot;soggy&quot;, it suggests that it might be found in the water.  Go into the water to forage (not sure if this would make any difference).  Track for any fish that may have been added to BB.  Look for a groundspawn, especially under the water.  IMO this would be the first piece.<br />
<br />
Second piece would have to be in FV if we follow the idea that it branches out from zone to zone.  Not sure about this one yet.  But it could be a goblin that stowed away in the ship and got off in FV.  It could also be that an NPC (like Niera's mother) found the maiden's hair in BB and thought she was doing good by harvesting some and bringing it to FV to help the fish there/to use it to help some other species or even humans (meaning all races)/purposely to try to get rid of the goblins, etc..  I would forage, fish, look for groundspawns, check for named goblins, check for new quest type NPC's etc..  We might be looking for seeds or a &quot;sample&quot; or a potion/vial. (Perhaps even ask some NPC's about Niera's mother, this might lead to more information).<br />
<br />
Third piece would be the Handful of Diseased Maiden's Hair from the forager.<br />
<br />
Fourth piece would be the Bag of Diseased Maiden's Hair from the goblin event.<br />
<br />
This is how the progression looks to me.</div></div><hr />

Except the Item Lore says it's not aquatic - assuming you can't falsify Item Lore on Lucy.  If you can, I guess we're still at square one.  Interesting that the ID number is lower than the Handfull - I know item IDs are largely unimportant, but it seems like we skipped something on our way to LoIO.  =/<br />

<br />
Lotus Cult knows nothing! stop bothering them.  I am a druid on the Quellious server, and have talked directly to Arbrus.  He knows no more about it than we do.  So this constant sending tells to him will probably lead to harassment petitions.  just leave him alone.  His guild raids almost nonstop so he is busy, and how is he supposed to keep his MT alive with people spamming him?  i wanna see you try it.  Again Arbrus knows NOTHING MORE THAN WE DO!<br />
<br />
Also ID numbers mean nothing, yeah they can try and give clues to the next item/s, but look at the necro epic, those ID numbers are not near each other.</div></div><hr />

*person* seen swimming out of SG.<br />
<br />
Passed through Cobalt Scar... <br />
<br />
Now the only way out of Velious on foot, ie no ports ( if memory serves - feel free to correct me )  is via Iceclad ocean.<br />
<br />
This in turn took you to North Ro and Antonica.<br />
<br />
We know he stoped off in rathe mountains for some reason as its foraged there to begin with.  <br />
<br />
( path = Oasis/so ro/innothule/ferrot )<br />
<br />
Did it spread there on his travels or was it deleberate ??<br />
Poison lake rathe ?<br />
<br />
Ok, so regardless of that for now....how to get to kunark.<br />
<br />
Lets assume he was evil ( clearly )... he/she would go via Oasis of mar -&gt; Tim deep -&gt; the Overthere -&gt; And low and behold he would be in frontier mountains... where he/she was killed.<br />
<br />
Again though... loio is a collection point... did he go the long way round : <br />
Oasis -&gt; tim -&gt; over -&gt; warsliks -&gt; loio -&gt; frontier<br />
<br />
There is our approx path.<br />

<br />
Going with the cold theme I spent yesterday in various Velious zones...<br />
<br />
Came out of Kael and had &quot;Raider spawner&quot; on track, db to 65.<br />
<br />
Got ~near~ it and BAM, hit me for around 800 fast and often, I exodus'd and went to get some help =)<br />
<br />
This mob has no model, just like our Ward, just a name and nothingness...<br />
<br />
Took me, Paly, Chanter and Mage back there and he agroed from WAY far away and snapped the mage in to pieces in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
It mitigates slow but is snarable/rootable none of my mukes ever landed for full, although chanter nukes did and it summons.<br />
<br />
But here is the weird part:<br />
<br />
[Tue Sep 21 15:02:57 2004] raider spawner says 'Foolish one, you are no match for the might of the Storms of Srerendi!'<br />
[Tue Sep 21 15:03:04 2004] Your faction standing with Greater Vind Giants got worse.<br />
[Tue Sep 21 15:03:04 2004] Your faction standing with Lesser Vind Giants got worse.<br />
[Tue Sep 21 15:03:04 2004] Your faction standing with Askr the Lost got better.<br />
[Tue Sep 21 15:03:04 2004] You gain party experience!!<br />
[Tue Sep 21 15:03:04 2004] The Srerendi warrior hacks and wheezes his last breath as his corpse slams to the ground.<br />
<br />
A PoS/BoT faction mob in EW?<br />
<br />
It did not spawn any other mobs in EW that I could find, and I searched the entire zone.<br />
<br />
Anyway, beware, this thing is death to a hapless low level that may be exp'ing there, as witnessed by the corpses we saw near this mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Came from Velius - Siren's grotto, to Cobalt Scar, thence to Antonica - Rathe Mountains,  then on to Kunark - Lake of Ill Omen, and Frontier Mountains - where he (she/it?) died at the hands of the Drogan goblins.<br />
<br />
Now I just went over the zone connection maps on EQ Atlas... if you come from Velious you come into North Ro, to go to Kunark, you leave from the Oasis of Marr - one zone away.<br />
<br />
So why the drop in Rathe Mountains? And the connection with Feerrott / CT et al?<br />
<br />
I suppose it could have gone via the spires in GD to Luclin and back down to NK and thence via lake rathe, rathe mountains and though feerrott and up to oasis that way...<br />

Whatever way this goes, It's a rather circuitous route.</div></div><hr />

What if a helpful parasite is cleaning the protective substance off of the plants and making them vunerable or consumable?<br />

Not trying to be argumenative here.  I did read your post...<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems we're stuck again in this part now. We need a 4th item.&quot;  <br />
<br />
By omission I assume the three items you are referring to are the Handful, Bag and Soggy.   My suggestion was to re-forage the Sickly from RM and try to combine those four items in the waterproof bag.   I'm sorry, but I didn't see in your post where you had tried that.<br />
<br />
<br />
** EDIT: - I fat-fingered the items in my original post **<br />
<br />
The combine I'm curious about is :<br />
<br />
Handful of Diseased Maiden's Hair (Bloodgill Forager)<br />
Bag of Diseased Maiden's Hair (Goblin Hider)<br />
Soggy Maiden's Hair (from Trigger Fish)<br />
Sickly Maiden's Hair (re-foraged original item from RM)<br />
<br />
in the Waterproof bag.</div></div><hr />

- DL, which connects to FM/LOIO<br />
- CS, which leads to SG/WW<br />
- Feerott, which goes to both CT and RM<br />
If our lead is the Unkempt Druids, it could be assumed they port around, leaving this chaotic trail. Perhaps we are looking for another port location.<br />
 <br />
Or, another track altogether (roaming EQAtlas at work, hehe). If we go with the &quot;ripple&quot; effect instead, starting at Timorous Deep (just because it is a main body of water):<br />
TD - OT - FM<br />
TD - FV - LOIO<br />
TD - Oasis - S Ro - Innothule - Feerott - CT/RM<br />
TD - Oasis - N Ro - Iceclad - EW - Kael - WL - Skyshrine - CS - SG - WW<br />
or<br />
TD - Oasis - N Ro - Iceclad - EW - Sleepers Tomb - DN - WW - SG - CS<br />
leaving<br />
TD - BB - ??<br />
 <br />
By the way, it is really annoying that there is a big block of nothingness in the middle of TD, but I'm not going to pin too much importance on that. And I dont think the teleport room with the pots would apply here, except to prove TD as a &quot;central&quot; zone. <br />
 <br />
I have NOT been able to do anything with this other theory, but, if the disease comes from the OoW zones, then it may spread from a Priest of Discord. And all the PoD's I have seen have been hairless. *wink* If anyone has time to verify, it sounds like the only PoD left ouside of OoW zones is in PoK? <br />
 <br />
And just a thought on the new fish; it would be fairly 'normal' for the dev's to think it cute to put in a &quot;Trigger Fish&quot; to &quot;trigger&quot; the rest of the druid epic. :bonk:</div></div><hr />

The funny thing is, a Triggerfish is a warm water fish that really cant swim well.  And we find a dead one in cobalt scar.<br />

I imagine TD or Oasis would be a logical place to look next.  Maybe WW or SkyShrine.</div></div><hr />

I believe that the above is part of the original Warrior Epic.<br />

However I too have been wandering around The Ocean of Tears today and just off the shore of the Aviak Island I tracked a fish called 'a Flighty Catfish'. It conned green to me at level 65. Was indifferent. Killed it and it dropped a 'Giant Catfish' No drop - said it could be used in tradeskills and was a meal. Tried combining it in a tacklebox with a filletting knife and nothing happened.<br />

Since reading everything I have not been able to find much else.  I did want to make a comment about everyone saying &quot;(item) is used for the Warrior Epic or Ranger epic or some other quest/epic&quot;  My feeling is that since the Ranger and Druid Epic were aligned a lot during the first Epic that I would not disregard the possibilty of some of these items being used for multiple Epics.

<br />
One small critique.  In the Handful section, it says &quot;Two snare, one does not.&quot;  This sort of implies that the mobs snare you, not that you can snare them.  I'd recommend a small rephrasing to avoid confusion, perhaps something like &quot;Two can be snared/rooted, one cannot.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah, just verified he's at least saying something different to max kos. Just went all killed all the warriors/shamans standing around him. I haven't done any part of the quests, etc., but when I hailed him, he didn't say his old &quot;you scum! go away&quot; line...</div></div><hr />

Only reason she jumped out at me this time is I did not notice her when I had explored the zone right after OoW's release. But, I hadn't started epic either and I didn't have my bag. So, I am just following the reasoning that you should have bag with you at all times. <br />
<br />
YES&lt; I am aware that things have been spawning whether or not we have the bag. BUT, I am just stating that I had not seen this mob when I went w/o it and I know for sure that no one has killed it or any of the new mobs in OOT on my server.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 Has anyone tryied to hail the human skeleton to see if it has further text in relation to epic 1.5 / 2 ? since Niera's mother died of disease and i beleieve that is the skelton of it .. perhaps it knows more of the disease ? maybe niera's mother was the one caught tresspassing and died of disease while captured by the goblins ? I think Niera's mother would be trying to do good but maybe did bad by introducing the disease to Kunark from Velious ? stoping by to visit the unkempt druids in RM on her way ?</div></div><hr />

That we had to kill 3 foragers one had what we need.... we have to kill one ulthork raider and his 2 buddies, the one had what we need ...In the FM event some people have found 3 to 4 hiders... I am thinking we need to find something in a group of 3... It's becoming very common in all of this...EW going with the water theory...isn't snow Frozen water?  and when snow lands on you it becomes wet..ie (waterproof bag) so it does fall into line with everything.. <br />
<br />
One question that I do have is where is this alligator charm coming from? I understand it's feerrott but what mob?I have seen it mentioned but have not seen what mob it came off of ...<br />
<br />
Now for the maiden's hair thing...Maiden's hair is a plant found in a FISH tank...hence the relationship to fish... So I have to agree that we may be looking for fish and the different kinds of hair...<br />
<br />
For another theory since we are going by lucy has anyone checked the known drops from other epics and see if it is in chronological order? <br />

I'm very interested in figuring this out as well.  The item lore &quot;Smooth clay wraps around the aged alligator scales&quot; might suggest the charm is crafted, but I can't find any alligator scales in lucy.  However, there is alligator hide and also a couple of alligator totems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MherylRanyhyn</div><div class="date">09-23-2004, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some rambling from a sleepy druid who can't log in today (and editing as I think of more, or get ideas from you):<br />
<br />
We were supposed to find where the source of all this disease is coming from.  In looking at the Maiden's Hair we have found so far, there's a pattern of sorts, where it goes from an innocuous but suspicious &quot;Soggy Maiden's Hair&quot; (This plant-singular-is not aquatic and has traces of a sticky film) all the way up to a whole &quot;Bag of Diseased Maiden's Hair&quot;. (small bag containing a handful of diseased plants).  The ones in between are either &quot;tinged with disease&quot; or &quot;wet and sickly looking&quot;.  And we have Nelia telling us that often diseases start out as helpful things, then mutate.  Thus the theory of starting with the least diseased plant/zone.<br />
<br />
So, the least diseased plant showed up in a fish in Cobalt Scar after a &quot;hairless one&quot; (the Othmir call all humanoids that) was seen coming out of Siren's Grotto.  He'd obviously been to Western Wastes and Dragon's Necropolis before then, but where did he come from?  Maybe Plane of Mischief? (its old zone in was in Temple of Veeshan) or maybe the Temple itself? Some ally of the CoV dragons?<br />
<br />
Somehow this &quot;disease&quot; and possibly the person carrying it either meant to go or unknowingly made it to Rathe Mountains.  From Velious, the way to do that would be on the Gnome Boat or translocator to North Ro.  So, he would have had to go through Wakening Land and Kael and Eastern Wastes on the way.<br />
<br />
Once in North Ro, he headed toward the Rathe Mts, possibly to talk to the Unkempt about this find of his. Or maybe he was feeling ill by this time and trying to find someone to help. He'd have gone through Oasis (gypsy camps), South Ro (wayfarer camp), Innothule (Gukta) and Feerott (Grobb)(could this be the missing part? the alligator charm, the pirahna meat, and a few other things to find another sub-quest?) to get there, leaving behind the disease in at least Cazic Thule.  But for some reason he kept going or the disease kept srpeading, til he got to Kunark.  To do so, he would have had to go through Lake Rathe, to South Karana, to the Spires and then headed for Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
From the Dreadlands, he (or the disease) more than likely went to FV first, maybe still looking for help, then through Lake of Ill Omen since that's the next most diseased plant. From there it's just a hop to the Frontier Mountains where he was captured somehow,(because he was too sick to fight back?) and the goblins got the &quot;prize&quot; of his diseased plant.  In trying to escape the goblins he may have sought refuge with the Iksar, or planned on trying to, finding his way through the Burning Wood and to Chardok, then Chardok B where the rangers found the sick animal there.  What happened to him? Or was it just the disease that ended up making it that far?  Could he maybe have been trying to get to Veeshan's Peak for help? If so, and if he made it out of Chardok, he would have had to go through Skyfire and The Overthere to do so.<br />
<br />
There's where our trail ends so far if I'm not mistaken, and that's a possibility this late at night.  But a couple things aren't adding up.  Mostly the fact that we can't combine the 4 plants in our collection bag yet and so we may have done something wrong, or not completed something that should be completed.<br />
Maybe the initial Maiden's Hair is not part of the combine since she's already seen that one, and we need one more.  It could explain the stuff we've got mixed in from CT and Feerott. It's just another quest we haven't solved.<br />

I believe that maybe there is some npc we are missing for a hail or something. Who knows? I'm seriously running out of ideas. I don't know where all this alligator crap is coming from :) If it has to do with lucy numbers or whatever, I really don't see where it fits in with anything... unless there is something new in UGUK or LGUK that I haven't seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have your ever been walking along,  pouring stuff out of a bag? It starts full and get smaller as you walk. I think the origin is near FM,  where the largest amount of Maiden,s hair was found.<br />
<br />
Othmir says it saw the harless one, coming out of SG. What creature is really hairless ( man/goblin )? Would go along with Unkept Druid theroy.<br />
<br />
They went to CS last, dropped the hair and stole the totem (Othmir/Goblin). Then thru Skyshrine to get to EW.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Puts WL ( entrance to PoG (Tunare)) , FV &amp; LoIO in the middle.</div></div><hr />

A disease wouldn't get less severe as it went on, but more severe and resistant.  Over time he or the disease is becoming more powerful and deadly, and that's reflected in the name change.<br />
<br />
Also because as the girl from Surefall tells us, often a disease will start out as a helpful thing, and then mutate.  So I'm assuming that possibly this guy was just feeding the fish or something innocent at first, not that it was a conspiracy to kill us all.</div></div><hr />

Bristlebane is the god of Mischief so perhaps he thinks he's being silly and harmless.

Yes, I checked the warnings. Wailing Walrus is not for us, Diseased or Injured animals either. But no mention of Ailing Manatee. Unless he is for another epic I am not aware off.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the clues seem to point to a disease originating in SG, so the most plausible zones to find something imho are SG, WW and CS. An ailing animal in SG fits right in.<br />

One other thing.....what do the item numbers look like from Epic 1  are they all in order like these are looking?  Maybe we have to do about the same where we need to cleanse 3 different Continents where we needed stones, and lots of other stuff before we could do the 3 cleansings.  It appears from the list we have discovered here that it is looking to do the same thing.  I may start looking into the old epic and try and find a correlation or any leads from that angle.</div></div><hr />

Let's think of the order here.<br />
<br />
You hand in Prexus Totem and get small trigger fish.<br />
<br />
Maybe you hand in Pirahna meat to get charm--OR-- the piranha meat we are finding is NOT the one we need. Maybe we have to find the feerrott charm and get the REAL piranha meat. <br />
<br />
Combine REAL meat in tackle box with new knife to get fourth piece of maidens {fill in the blank}<br />
<br />
Additional: in each of the known cases, we have to fight something to get the drop. This leads met to think the missing piece is not a forage, but either a) part of a gobbie-esque contest or b) guarded by some mob &quot;set&quot; of three (three gobbies in LOIO, three ulthorks in EW) that are two &quot;fakes&quot; and one real.<br />

It's entirely possible that there is a sub-quest NPC out in the Feerott or adjacent zone that would require these items in return for a &quot;Maiden's Hair-related item&quot;, but we won't know it until we get it.  If this is true, maybe we just have to find him.  Also, BlumBlum was an old NPC with new text, so it's possible that Sony have re-used an old NPC for the afore mentioned hypothetical sub-quest as well.<br />

We should be doing lots of hailing after the patch. =)<br />

The chanters are in the same boat of trying to &quot;decipher&quot; their clues :bs: <br />
With this patch, they DID receive a little more info from one of the quest texts they received. So we may need to back track a bit and see if any of the other druid quest givers are a bit more forthcoming <br />

I am thinking this may not be related to the druid epic but if this disease passed through WL the Giants may be wanting some more supplies to fight this disease. Plus i know that there are some other older druid quests in WL/Kael. Just a thought <br />
