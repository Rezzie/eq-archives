<br />
The Druids Grove will soon switch to an alternate hosting plan with different forum software as part of a plan to put us in a more affordable and maintainable place for the long-term.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is also going to have some drawbacks.  We will not be transferring any user accounts or posts; however, there will be a read-only archive of all existing posts.  PMs will not be transferred to the new forums.  If you have any PMs you want to save, save them now!<br />
<br />
I know these seem like pretty drastic drawbacks, but it will provide us with more reasonable costs (lower monthly hosting fees, no annual board upgrade license fees) and board software that's much easier to upgrade and maintain.<br />
<br />
In addition to the forum software change, we'll be merging the EQ and WoW forums into the same board.  The board structure should be mostly the same as now, with some consolidation.  Other aspects will not change -- we are not selling out and will not be placing ads on the board.<br />
<br />
So, the other big question: when is this happening?  Our current hosting expires at the end of October, so the move will likely be happening mid-October.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and let me know if you have any questions!</div></div><hr />

You know the grove wouldn't be complete without you, Monsieur.  It was all in jest, love. :shuffle:</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info. PHPBB are pretty good boards and free. Sounds like a smart move.</div></div><hr />
