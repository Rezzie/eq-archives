But, started with the original three, and they made it into a production company. One of the first things I noticed about them, was during Television shows, pictures(a friend of mine is a big blue nut, she met them a bunch of times and the faces were all different in the pictures, from show to show). Cirque de Soleil, has a rotating troope travel crew as well, meaning same dates different places. Not for certain, but, I believe the Transsiberian orchestra does as well.</div></div><hr />

The one that you see traveling around is the group that's doing the &quot;How to be a Megastar v2.0&quot; tour.  The first Blue Men are pretty much just running the PR and marketing now and they're based out of NYC - as well as new material creation, of course.<br />
<br />
Per city, there are also multiple &quot;Blue Men&quot; groups - I saw the show twice in Vegas and it was a different set of people each time.  It's not a franchise, but more a multiple troop organization is all - either way, I'd see them again in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />
