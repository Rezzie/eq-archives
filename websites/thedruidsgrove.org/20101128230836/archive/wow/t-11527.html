<br />
Can anyone tell me if the &quot;Impact&quot; and &quot;Striking&quot; enchants work on the 2-hand mace while in feral form? <br />
<br />
Do any weapon procs (i.e. icy, firey, etc. ) trigger while in cat/bear form? <br />
<br />
Or would it be best to go with a stat bonus?<br />
<br />
I would like to know before spending money on the mats and enchanting services.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Anything that says &quot;Chance on hit:&quot; or enchants who does that (crusader, lifesteal, fiery etc etc) will not work in feral forms.<br />
Stuff that says &quot;Equip:&quot; does work in feral forms, even if it has a &quot;chance on succsesful melee attack to...&quot; part.<br />
An example is the Darkmoon Card trinkets, Warlords which basically is chance on hit to heal yourself, or elementals which is chance on hit to inflict nature dmg.</div></div><hr />

Enchant Weapon - Mongoose<br />
&quot;Permanently enchant a Melee Weapon to occasionally increase Agility by 120 and attack speed slightly.  Requires a level 35 or higher item.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I wonder if it is a chnce to do so over a period of time, whether it works in forms is the question. Imagine this in bear form (120agil x 4.2 = 504 armor)  120AP  etc.. crit<br />
<br />
But will it work? It is on a weapon I suppose so maybe not!..</div></div><hr />

I would assume that it is a proc because it is quite random if it just out of the blue increases your Agility by 120 and atkspd.<br />
<br />
You will probably want someone to clear that up for you though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now judging from this piece of information i would conclude that it does NOT work in forms, as it says that its the Melee Weapon (hits) that occasionally increases agi and atkspeed, and in forms you dont use melee weapons but your paws.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, im just guessing, but I would be very surprised if this enchant works when enchants like lifesteal and crusader doesent.<br />
<br />
Permanently enchant a melee weapon so that often when attacking in melee it heals for 75 to 125 and increases Strength by 100 for 15 sec.<br />
<br />
Permanently enchant a melee weapon to often steal life from the enemy and give it to the wielder.</div></div><hr />

Can u imagine how holy it would make tanking :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirion</div><div class="date">02-15-2007, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for the actual answer to the original question, no enchant weapon impact/striking has no effect on feral forms.  Feral damage is given a defined damage and weapon speed that is only affected by your stats such as ap, agi, str.  The speed and damage of your weapon make no difference in feral damage.  <br />
<br />
The enchant you speak of ups the overall damage of the weapon when it is swung.  It is not a chance on hit proc.  It is a constant damage increase to use of the weapon while in caster form.<br />
<br />
However some nice enchants to put on a (2H) weapon would be the new AP to weapon (90) or 35 agility.  I prefer agility as it adds crit, ac, ap, and dodge in cat as well as crit, dodge, and ac in bear.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />

Imagine this in bear form (120agil x 4.2 = 504 armor) 120AP etc.<br />
Agility armor bonuses are NOT multiplied by the Dire Bear effect.</div></div><hr />
