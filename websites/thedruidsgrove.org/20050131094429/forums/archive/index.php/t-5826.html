I've never played any of the FF series but have heard it's good. Not sure I'm ready for another MMORPG tho.<br />
<br />
Also, what about LoEQ? I don't care about the beta, but saw it in the store too. I used to play SC and related strat games, but never anything fantasy related like WC or such.<br />
<br />
Gonna load KOTOR now, later.<br />

<br />
The official website is fairly worthless - not a surprise<br />
<br />
Gamespot seemed to like it, saying it was quite similar to other MMORPGs out there, but had a unique style -- they gave it an 8.something out of 10.  That's pretty high for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
UI and control setup are NOT customizable AT ALL...  turns your pc into a playstation for all intents and purposes.<br />
<br />
Gameplay is good.  Grouping is required at higher levels (15+)<br />
<br />
Pretty much 2 seperate communites on the servers...  Japanese speakers and English speakers.  Much like many eq servers, but seems more prevalent.<br />
<br />
Its not bad...  It's not the be all end all of mmog's like most people will try to tell you, those people being mostly burned out on eq or whatever other game they just recently came from.</div></div><hr />

I didn't have much of a desire to play this game before based on the world pass and the glowing description of baby-talk (&quot;likey-wikey&quot;), but this is the third nail in the coffin.</div></div><hr />

HOLY SHEETSET BATMAN!<br />

ONE one UNO A Single ein 1 ..... ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS WHOLE WORLD who knows that the phrase is &quot;intents and purposes&quot; and not &quot;intensive purposes&quot;.... <br />
<br />
THANK YOU TIANE!  YOU HAVE MADE THE CACKLER's DAY!<br />
<br />
i can't count how many times i have to read about intensive purposes on peoples posts from the 3-4 boards i read...  i am often left wondering what is so intesive about it...<br />
<br />
CACKLE's TO TIANE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
.... took 1 day to uninstall (over 2 hours... i went to bed.)  another day to reinstall....<br />
<br />
chat still didn't work....<br />
<br />
basically wasted a week watching it's little blue bar slide across the screen a few times.  great use of 50 bucks.  more entertainment than if i'd'a gone to see ronald mcdonald -vs- kris kringle in a wwf cage match!</div></div><hr />

I try to be correct, especially in a high profile job like this one.  And besides, my Dad is an english teacher and I read a ton of real books.  8P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you can customize the keyboard.  You have to go under options, choose the compact keyboard setting, and then you can modify what does what pretty easilly.   Once I got my keyboard settings to match EQ for the most part I was golden.<br />
<br />
The only thing that irks me is you have to hit CTRL or SHIFT to use your macros, but I got used to doing that for SWG.  I rarely use the mouse in FFXI actually.  Only for talking to NPC's in towns and such for quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL!  I've never seen anyone use intensive purposes.  That is pretty funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladred</div><div class="date">12-09-2003, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FFXI is really a spectacular game design. The visual effects are stunning and the charcter creation, and progression is intriguing. The Bazaar, and Auction system work well. The loot distribution is solid.<br />
<br />
Some things that could use tweaking. Time to engage during large scale fights. Registering, and making the first content ID, as this process usually weeds out most people that become interested in playing.<br />
<br />
The non customizable UI thing doesn't bother me AT ALL, I mean in general play you don't see any of the UI. Once you get to level 10 you're pretty comfortable with the controls and workings of the keyboard and mouse, just many people don't make it that far. In reality it's no different than any other game that you have to get used to the controls of.<br />
<br />
They also have a translation system that offers keyphrases and statements that can be translated to and from Japanese/English. This really eases communication, and I'm even starting to recognize several of the Japanese characters.<br />
<br />
In my opinion this game is just neat, if you're a Final Fantasy fan it plays just like a FF game, literally. The only difference is that other people are playing right along side of you.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I just must get 18 so I can sub!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladred</div><div class="date">12-22-2003, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually just dinged 16 as redmage and changed jobs to a monk so I can farm more crystals. I'm trying to work up my tradeskills as early as possible so I'm going to keep changing jobs at level 10 of every job so I can keep collecting crystals in the 'newb' areas.<br />
<br />
One thing I can say though is that the skillchain system is fabulous! It makes it hard as a healer when you see a perfect level 3 skill chain go off with two nukes added on the end. The eye candy is fabulous!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really should get back into FFXI... my mithra warrior and tarutaru blackmage miss me, but I've been lost in NWN with scripting and a new server I just found.  FFXI will still be there for years to come though.  ANd I don't wanna burn out from it like EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">travellingjack</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">woah, hey I been in FFXI since introduction to US markets. I remembered the original FF way back in, what? 80ish?<br />
<br />
Well I am not disappointed, it is definately different. Star Wars Galaxies held my attention for about 6 weeks...burned out big time, awful experience, constant rehashing of the abilities, nerfing and unnerfing,ENOUGH!<br />
<br />
You can be any of the classes they offer, what is more, you can have a sub class at half you main class, example: whitemage level 30/ blackmage level 15. Of course, there are the sterotypes, but in FFXI you can break the mold and really mix up classes and see how you character evolves.<br />
<br />
This game has been online in Japan for over a year so the bugs are worked out, not a lot of apologies for fixes that do not fix, or make things worse. Sure there are Japanese who do not associate with English, but there are many more who do. While there is a translator in the game, it is not perfect but you can group with all Japanese or just a single one and still get your fun.<br />
<br />
Very rarely have I been in a degrading group, yes there are hose-heads out there everywhere but they do not last long in the FFXI game (Hey this is a grouping game over level 15 so you remember rude people)<br />
 <br />
Most of all, I can say cooperation is the name of the game, you like to hunt in groups, up to 6 in a single or 18 in an alliance, you can relax and enjoy the world of FFXI... btw The beastmaster is an excellent solo artist for those who solo. <br />
<br />
A new way to attack is to add attacks with skillchains, and it is a must for the higher monsters out there.<br />
I ramble, so it is up to you to find out more... not sure if the link will work out of this message but here is an address to look at http://ffxi.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?fitem=432</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anka</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a one sentence comparison ... it looks better than EQ but not so much better that you'd want to drop a 2 year old EQ character and start afresh on FF. Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
It looks great. It's UI is designed for gamepads not PC keyboards, and that could annoy a lot of people. Mini-instancing seems nicely woven into gameplay. The markets seems to work ok. Tradeskills are the same as EQ. There's no need in the game for twinked alts. It has a friendly feel. If you like blood, torture, gore and walking dead then you probably won't like the cuddly moogles. I can't comment on higher level play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tils</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well im level 47 now and still having fun with FFXI.<br />
<br />
Only thing really is the level gap can be anoying sometimes when you want to group. Above 3-4 levels and the experience drops rapidly which is a shame should be more like 5-6 levels.<br />
<br />
Atm I cannot see myself coming back to EQ even after putting 4 years into it (Unless this expansion is very good). EQ to me has gotten stale but im sure for alot of people its still fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">03-24-2004, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what level are you up to now Tils? =-p(not that you'll see this for a month or two probably! ) I'm slowly getting up there in FFXI, just finnaly started getting some experience again this week... permanent groups really make FFXI more fun, especially as you get higher and higher level. Though.. as a white mage, I wouldn't have much trouble finding a group, but damage dealers especially have trouble at the high end. It's nice logging on with 4/6 of a group, all the main parts covered hehe.</div></div><hr />
