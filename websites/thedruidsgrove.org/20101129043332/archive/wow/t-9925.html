I would say about half the threads in each of the class forums are about nerf this and nerf that.  Then about half of the discussions in the legitimate threads are nerf this nerf that, overpowered, etc.  <br />
<br />
This is something that almost every class experience in their forum.<br />
<br />
This forum here at the druid's grove is great because you can say something even about other classes without a bunch of stupidity about nerfing something or how a class is played by a bunch of 12 year olds.<br />
<br />
Not alot of point to the thread - mainly a vent at the crap moderation in the wow forums and a :texla: to these moderators.</div></div><hr />

The whole &quot;NERF &lt;insert class&gt;, they're overpowered&quot; stuff gets old.  Yes, some classes are overpowered, some are underpowered, and I would like to see some changes, but in the end it's all dependant on how much you play, how well you play and your gear, for the most part.  It's just sad because it seems most of the official forums is all about complaining about getting owned by another class in some way.  Not a lot of constructive advice/information, unlike this site, which is FULL of great information and people.</div></div><hr />

I'll check in as much as I can though.  I'm going to miss everything about it.</div></div><hr />
