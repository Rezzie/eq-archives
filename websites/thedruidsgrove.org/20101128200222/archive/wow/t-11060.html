I can't find any help anywhere. Please help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Similarly, to come back up, right click and drag up, then go forward.<br />
<br />
I remember wishing there was a keyboard shortcut for that...</div></div><hr />

Swimming in aquatic form is really handy.  It is often used as a getaway tactic versus other classes that are slower in the water.  I also recall using it often in places like Stranglethorn vale when your collecting scales and tailfins off the murlocs.  2nd to the undead racial.  Thats the best.</div></div><hr />

It seems so simple, but i guess if you dont use your mouse to change which direction you face i could see how it would be less obvious.</div></div><hr />

What I do is hold down both left and right mouse button and kinda make a swoop motion downward with the mouse, it seems to work all of the time for me now, although there might be an easier way *shrug*</div></div><hr />
