<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">04-21-2005, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I was in the AH last night and saw a warrior wielding &lt;a href=&quot;http://thottbot.com/?i=35887&quot;&gt;Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt; and it made me really want to have something huge and cool like that.  My guildmates informed me that it was the warrior's &quot;epic weapon&quot; - so I started thinking about the druid side...<br />
<br />
I came to the conclusion that I had not really been paying attention to the druid &quot;epic&quot; quests - for either armor or weaponry.<br />
<br />
I did some searches on Thott, but druid specific quests seem to end at level 16, and I figure that we don't get our epic at 16... or else I should really pay more attention.<br />
<br />
So, if anyone can start throwing links at me on where I can do a bit more research on the druid epics, I'd appreciate it!</div></div><hr />

Priest is a neat staff that has two versions (one for healing and one for shadow). Maybe the Druid epic will be something similar, one for healing, one for feral or balance.</div></div><hr />

Those are really worth spending DKP on REALLY! (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=37419) GG devs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We only have 4 level 60 Druids and only 2-3 per raid so I will hopefully start to get some new things soon (I've only gotten cenarion gloves so far.)  But I'm fairly new to the guild and very new to MC.</div></div><hr />
