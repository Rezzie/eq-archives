<br />
After needing to attend to stuff like life for a while, I took maybe 6 months off and came back shortly after WotLK hit the shelves.<br />
<br />
Back in the day my Boomkin was usually top of the Damage List in Kara.<br />
<br />
Now I'm 80 with some respectable, though not great gear, and the Huntards are trouncing me in Naxx.  What gives?!  I'm making like 1/2 to 1/3 the dps of others on the raid.  Haven't run with any other Druids yet, so don't know how they compare...<br />
<br />
What's wrong with me?<br />

That believe it or not is an absolutely HUGE factor to your dps. Such a large factor, in fact, that you would do well to focus solely on acquiring +hit gear and or echantments. there are two specific trinkets that come to mind which would give you an additional 140 hit rating (or thereabotus), one from Heroic VH and the other is a quest out of wyrmrest temple. These two trinkets alone would bring you up about a full 5-6%. from there you can try speccing into IFF for the +3% hit. Even losing  spellpower and crit from your trinkets would still yield you a greater dps return based on the +hit.</div></div><hr />
