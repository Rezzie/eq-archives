I saw them at Best Buy so I picked one up.<br />
<br />
I have to say, This keyboard rocks.  It looks good, feels good to type on and has a ton of great features.  Notable features include:<br />
<br />
<br />
 The Ability to disable the &quot;windows&quot; key to prevent accidental deaths because you fat fingered the keyboard.<br />
 Two USB Ports on the Keyboard itself so you can attach your mouse and joystick easily.<br />
 18 programmable keys to record macros<br />
 back lit keys so you can read the keyboard in low light.<br />
 No stupid &quot;F-Lock key&quot; that changes your F keys to other functions.<br />
 A LCD display that shows Time/date, System CPU/RAM usage, and will soon be able to display gaming information such as health, ammo, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a good keyboard, I recommend this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the keyboard, seems alright. Some of the features seem ok (mainly the info screen), but I hate non natural/ergonomic keyboards =-( And the USB ports arn't powered (likely), so you can't use them for some devices, but it's still handy (my old MS keyboard has two as well).</div></div><hr />

Someone at work told me the reviews weren't good.  I should get it anyway.  I kind of liked the first one, although I didn't play it much because it was during my EQ obsession.</div></div><hr />

I'm enjoying it well enough, think I'm about halfway through it. I kinda suck at the combat aspect of it... I don't get my Creature out there in combat/training enough, have him helping out the town usually =-p So I end up taking over most of the towns via impressiveness. The pets not nearly as annoying to manage as in the first one, and there is a menu (I didn't notice this for awhile =-p) with taught/untaunt lessons, which if you click on the lesson will let you punish/reward him for that action, even if he isn't attempting to do it right then. So if you miss the bubble popping up questioning wether he should do something or not, you can just go into the menu to pick what you want him to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tossing villagers in the prison is fun. <br />
Hearing your pet say things like, &quot;I kind of have to poo&quot; &quot;Should I poo on the villagers&quot; is fun.<br />
Best of all the most wanted building by my villagers was the &quot;torture pit&quot; I mean how could I turn them down? I put it to use too. <br />
<br />
Combat is really easy to manage. The cow is really funny. I like B&amp;W2.</div></div><hr />

If you place a building near the edge of the ring, it will expand it. Some things expand it more than others. I've found drawing roads and placing like mansions to be a good way to expand it, as well as giving your people nice houses that make them happy (houses bunched together, i.e. slums, works well for population control but doesn't lead to happy people).<br />
<br />
And I don't think combat is hard to manage, just my creature sucks at it (low muscle, non existant fat, though I do have Advanced Warrior for him). I'm using the Wolf by the way, was tempted to use the Tiger, but eh!</div></div><hr />

LOL, an old guildmate did that.  His wife told me he kept an actual supply of keyboards nearby! :P<br />
<br />
But maybe i'll pick it up soon. Need a new keyboard to pair with my Logitech MX510 mouse (wtb the new laser ones!)<br />
<br />
I just retired my MX510 and picked up the G5 when I got the keyboard.  The G5 is the same shape as the 510 but the texture of the mouse is a bit different.  Personally, I thought my red mx510 was a more attractive, but the ability to change the mouse's resolution on the fly seems to be worth the swap for me.  The idea of including varying weights with the mouse was kind of funky, but, after a short amount of time, I am starting to notice the subtle differences.<br />
<br />
But, I'm a hardware junky.  I spend way too much money on this stuff. While I would go spend the $60 for a new mouse, I expect most wouldn't.  If you're running the MX510, I can't say there is a truly compelling reason to get the G5 unless you are a hard core gamer that demands the absolute edge, or a hardware addict like myself.</div></div><hr />

! But that's like THE perfect key for me when using Vent/TS! It kind of helps that I don't run the explorer shell, either. ;)<br />
<br />
No stupid &quot;F-Lock key&quot; that changes your F keys to other functions.<br />
OMG! /cheers for Logitech. That F-lock key is just that, a F*kin crappy ass lock key. I hate how it's not &quot;turned on&quot; by default when starting windows.<br />
<br />
    * A LCD display that shows Time/date, System CPU/RAM usage, and will soon be able to display gaming information such as health, ammo, etc.<br />
I like that, although ammo and health won't work while in WoW.<br />

<br />
G keys -- are they limited to just mimic'ing other keys? I mean, the keyboard is littered with 108 keys, however only about 25 of them keys are readily avaliable to the left hand. The right hand will be on the mouse. The rest is generally used to either mimic the left side or to use keys that aren't as &quot;hard pressing&quot; (ie; not as crucial).<br />
<br />
Now, say you play WoW where the keyboard is litterally litered with keycommads for the UI. Can you use the G keys sepereately from the full 108ky spectrum? As independent keys for assignment.<br />

They mentioned WoW on their main product page, but I don't think they thought of the possibility of &quot;running out&quot; of hot keys on the keyboard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure if you can use the G keys seperately and map them from within a game.  I'll try when I get home tonight.<br />
<br />
But....  There are two ways to program the Gkeys.<br />
1. There is a program button on the keyboard that lets you map keys /macro's on the fly.<br />
2.  The applet that comes with the board, lets you create profiles for each game and it lets you create your keys/macro's. <br />
<br />
There are only 18 G-Keys (all on the left side) but, each key can have 3 macro's programmed to it (via a select key above the G Keys) per profile.  Profiles can be automatically loaded when you start your game.  So, you really have 54 keys per profile, which has no limit.<br />
<br />
When programming macro's, you can have complete sentences programmed.  You can even have it retain any delay between keystrokes.<br />

Its about 3 inches wider than your average MS or Logitech Keyboard.  Hieght and depth are about the same.  It fit on my keyboard tray no problem.</div></div><hr />

about 75% of all the keys on the standard keyboard is already taken by the default UI settings. Then you have them shift+, cntl+ and alt+ key commands. shift+alt+ is too complicated to keep hitting, making it difficult to add anymore keys outside of the initial cntl,shift, alt commands. Oh and not to forget that many cntl+ commands are already taken up by default application commands (cntl+c, cntl+v, etc).<br />
<br />
What I would love to so is, say, setup spell commads to like G1-12 and then use the keys 1-+ for something else, but from what I'm seeing, that's not possible as G1-12 will have to mimic a standard keyboard sequence. Basically, I'd like to convert the G keys to 1-12 x 3 and still retain my standard #, cntl-# and alt-# key commands.</div></div><hr />

I'll see if that's possible, I honestly have no idea, but, the applet does recongnize several games and gives several options for what you can bind to any keys.  There may be something like that already set up.<br />
<br />
I don't have WoW, but, the keyboard finds a profile for EQ2, so it may be possible for me to test that function anyway.  I'll try and let you know.</div></div><hr />

I was in a team that won our national WCG Counter Strike tourney about 2-3 years ago and we went to Korea to compete in the international event. I've seen players that use these to glide their mice faster, however I don't think they are necesary at all. Perhaps you enjoy the confort of it? Better for the wrist or something? Just curious.<br />

Mousepads though... are a whole nother thing! Func pad for the win :)</div></div><hr />

Basically, take your mouse and attempt to move it a pixel at a time. It's not easy on normal nice as their feet will tend to &quot;stick&quot; to the desk/mousepad when moving in such minute detail.</div></div><hr />

I also got AOE3 installed, but I'll probably hold off on that one until I finish with B&amp;W2.  Interesting thing about AOE3, it installed with the default graphics set to &quot;crap&quot; mode, and I was wondering why AOE3 looked worse than AOE2.  When I set all my graphics options to &quot;high,&quot; well, it looked much better, but I was getting about 2FPS  :D</div></div><hr />

One thing I wonder ... When using multiple language keyboards, your keys actually change to a different ASCII/UFT-8 value to reprecent the language at hand. Think it would be possible to say bind russian letters to each of the G keys and then use them as actual hotkeys within the games? This would actually work and increase your keys 10fold if this was possible.<br />
<br />
Would be cool if you could bind '&#1076;' to G1 instead of having it rely on your 'D' key when using the Russian keyboard layout.</div></div><hr />

It turns out that the mouse feet are already Teflon.  And they aren't small either!!!!!!  <br />

Polytetrafluoroethylene (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teflon) gaming feet <br />
Forget sticky workarounds&#8212;the G5's durable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) feet give the ultra-smooth glide you want in a gaming mouse.</div></div><hr />
