<br />
Unfortunately at work, I can't remember his name or his guild. I'll be editing this later when I get a chance. In anycase, I was in Thunderbluff was broke, but full of linen, seriously low on bag space because as my first real char I took two gathering professions. Anyways, I hit: /2 Any low level tailors out there? This guy responds saying he is 115 in tailoring. So I say, I would like to comission you for a couple of linen bags, I can't pay with money, but I have a stack of linen and the rest is yours. We meet up in the barrens where he is currently. He starts making the bolts of cloth and realizes he has no thread. At this point he leaves, runs to town, makes the bags, and comes back.The guy not only does that, but makes me 2 additional linen bags and one wool bag. Then will not let me pay him any of the extra linen, saying I might need it for bandages. We trade buffs and go on our way. Suffice it to say, any tailoring work I need done for a while will be funneled through him with a heavy tip.<br />
<br />
So, any one really gone out of their way for you? Post let us know that not every PuG is terrible, not everyone outside your regular group is stupid, and not everyone outside your circle of friends is trying to rip you off.<br />

For instance, whenever I'm standing around waiting for someone or something, I've made a habit of buffing all the random people around me.  So one day I was waiting around at Freewind Post for someone to arrive, and I buffed a guy as he ran by.  He turns around, opens a trade window with me, and passes me a set of shoulders that I'm still using almost 10 level later just because they were so good for that level.  Gotta love stuff like that.<br />
 <br />
I try to return the favor as well.  For instance, I ran back to Mulgore and the starting areas for the Taurens since I needed to grab some low level drops for a skill, and I started giving out Light Armor Kits and any other drops I got that I didn't need to the lowbies that were around there.  Loads of fun doing that since most of them have never seen anyone above level 10, and even if they have they didn't expect to be given a moment's notice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This illustrates why I carry 40 spring waters and bread(25?) just in a spare pack.  I have a bit of an anxiety problem with not having 40 mana/health left for BG at a moments notice.  So having 4 stacks gets on peoples nerves to make for me. :)</div></div><hr />

believe me, alotta horny guys play wow, its rather funny playing a female, alotta people go over the limit because theyre hidden behind a wow character. <br />

All I ask is to keep the items they don't want so that I can sell in AH.  If you are on Laughing Skull, I can solo anything Uldaman or below and am always willing to bring someone with me, especially if they can heal so that I don't hafta worry about shifting out to do so myself.<br />

[EDIT]  I do the soloing to gather shards or gear to sell in the AH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have a tailoring story too.  in cenaurius' early days, he was poor and nearly bagless.  a guy i had been questing with after learning this made me 4 woolen bags for free and would accept no compensation.  i also met a fellow druid while questing in duskwood who had gotten the leather hat from the rare worgen spawn.  i complimented him on his hat (i was hatless at the time), and about two hours later i received one he had found on the AH in the mail as a gift.</div></div><hr />

My favorite thing to do was hang out around Skull Rock or anywhere that drops good cloth, ya know for first aid.  I'll take anyone through the quests in tiragarde, skull rock, echo isles, etc if they let me take the cloth.  Which I make into bandages and give them anyway/</div></div><hr />

My alchemy is pretty high, so I always try to keep a stock of potions I can't use (rage, fire power, etc...) to give out when I do group up.

When folks walk by who have lesser armor, I strike a deal and say you help me with the items, and I'll make two, one for each of us.  They get a little XP and a free armor upgrade, and I get to save a LOT of time.  Works out nice!<br />
<br />
And yeah, I'm also very OCD about buffing random passerby.  Gotta love that druid/priest exchange; they seem to return the favor more than anyone else. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do charity playing from time to time but not to make it to easy. Usually i help with gear as green gear usually cost next to 0 to me as a lworker and sometimes running instances.<br />
<br />
The running instances i don't like to do a lot because it makes them lazy and skillless but once in a while it doesn't hurt heehehe...<br />
<br />
And on the other hand, yes, from time to time i get amazed about the quality of the PUG i get, it makes you wonder if they nerfed the instance...<br />

Yea, I just talk like a guy and many people get it unless they have some forlorn hope of meeting a girl online :mad:(I dont have those same dreams)<br />
As for nice people, One 60 hunter took me through stockades and SM with some friends. <br />
Another time I took a 15 priest though Deadmines twice.<br />

I went back to same spot and some level 4 druids getting pummeled by some wolfs, I stayed with them till they got to level 6. Even gave them some nice potions to keep them stronger for a hr. <br />
<br />
Sometimes when I'm playing I get buffed and look around nobody is there, so I just type thanks. Kinda funny cause I did same thing yesterday, I saw Level 10 druid fighting some centaurs so I hid behind a tree and kept healing him. He would look around like he was searching for the person who healed him. I kept that up for like 20 min...lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had an AH incident on a Warlock alt.  I saw in Trade channel 'Enchanted Runecloth bag on AH'. So, I went and looked.  It was there for 80s!  Of course, I bought it, knowing full well it was a pricing error.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, 1 minute later I get a frantic whisper along the lines of 'OMG, I cant believe I did that, I put the wrong Buyout figure!' etc etc.  (Cant remember what he was supposed to put it up as, just that it would have been overpriced).<br />
<br />
So, being the nice guy that I am (and what goes around, comes around), I sent it back to him via mail, and log off shortly afterwards.<br />
<br />
The next day, I log back in, check my mail, and there is a 20g gift from the guy, in thanks for giving him back the bag!  (At this stage, I was poor, having less than 10g to my name).<br />
<br />
It's nice to be nice, but it's better having someone being nice back :)<br />
<br />
(Oh, and I sent the guy back 10g.  20g was too much for a simple mistake.)<br />

This morning when I logged on I check my mail only to find out someone had sent me 100 gold. Turns out this guy was migrating to our server but had recently started a character here and I was the first 2 offer him any help.Now im 100 gold richer and I got a new guild member :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always enjoy helping others out, maybe because I have done the game solo up to this point (a couple of PuG's but nothing longstanding). Now that I can hold my own in most situations I like helping others. I give out MotW to everyone and constantly give out the scroll buffs, I have loads of (pick up a few stack in each instance it seems). <br />
But the other day I was riding the boat and I threw MotW, an Intellect III scroll, and a Strength III scoll on this lowbie priest. Well, he thanked me and we moved our seperate ways. Later that night I got a pst from him asking to walk him through Deadmines to collect some gear. I was bored and wanted to see if I could tank all through the instance (I was 44 at the time and had not solo'd Deadmines before). So I agreed and we completed the instance with EASE! Again he thanked me and we went out seperate ways. A couple of days later I get a + healing staff, fr helm and + healing gloves (cant remember which they were since I'm at work), but they were all excellent gear items that we superior to the ones I currently had. Anyway the sender was unfamiliar to me but it said &quot;Thanks for the runthrough on my Priest, here's a little something for your time&quot;.<br />
I pst the sender and it turns out this guy was a 60 warrior playing his alt priest that night. Just goes to show you that kindness pays off in the end and don't be fooled by lowbie toons, many have big brothers out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I was playing on my Warrior Alt the other night, and someone was LF Tank SFK.  I was about 6 lvls too high for the instance (all mob lvls were gray), but they had been asking for a Tank in LFG channel for a while so I volunteered.  We cleared the whole thing with ease, then wiped twice at the end guy... one wipe was cause I got MC'd and a mage in our group killed me, and another was for some dumb reason.<br />
<br />
After that run I get this random tell from a tier2 troll mage saying &quot;thanks for taking us through that instance.  I know you didn't get any drops or xp... anythign that I can help you with?&quot;  He ended up running me through RFK twice in about 1hr15min, and giving every single drop to me.  Was really cool of him.<br />
<br />
On my druid and priest I buff everyone I see, and try to go out of my way to help people.  Just goes to show that the golden rule applies to video games as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However for the nicest thing that's ever happened to me in WoW... well there haven't been too many cases where someone has been terribly nice to me unless it's a friend I've had for months and months. However I remember one time, a friend of mine but someone who I don't talk to that much nor is very close to me, he was helping me with a quick quest and Myrmidon's Signet dropped, he needed it just as much as I did, (He was a pally btw) but refused to even roll on it. <br />
<br />
Albeit this guy.. wow some amazing things happen to him, he gets BoE epics to drop every 1-2days (I've seen it happen) but he just gives them out to random people/group members without a second thought.<br />
<br />
And that, is one of the reasons I believe in karma ;)</div></div><hr />
