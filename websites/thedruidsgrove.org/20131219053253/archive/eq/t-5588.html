Everyone makes grammatical errors, but the above should not be committed by any native speaker of the English language.  Yes, I recognize that non-native speakers make errors like this all the time, but 75% of the players in this game do not speak English as a second language!<br />
<br />
Hmmm...on second thought, perhaps it's accurate to say that 75% of the players in EQ don't speak English at all....<br />

So, anyone have any similar errors that drive them nuts?</div></div><hr />

While I will agree with you on both grammar recommendations.. I still cast’d a lot of spells over the course of Sobe's life and was blessed with a lot of phat lootz! :P<br />
<br />
As for others: <br />
<br />
heh is short for.. hehe .. <br />
but not all the time.. some people I have found take offense to &quot;heh&quot;.. they take it as a stuck up person response or a demeaning response.  <br />
<br />
I have found it to be a more common among people when they either A) have no response 'heh' or possibly negative in manner so they give way to a &quot;heh&quot; instead of  chalking up an arguement B) &quot;heh&quot; yes you got me! (when they are they find themselves at the butt end of a joke C) heh.. &quot;meaning&quot; I rather not give a response... so I give up D) &quot;heh&quot; not in the mood for jokes, but yea that was funny E) Heh &quot;sometimes in response to a statement that really didn't make sense, or a person says something that really didn't need to be said. <br />
<br />
There is so many meanings to &quot;heh&quot; and it does transcribe through a text environment such as Boards, IRC's, Game's etc.. if you try not take offense to the word.. sometimes that three letter word will allow people to focus in on what your saying instead of by-passing your entire post due to the fact that your arguing a statement that really is just someone’s view.. that may not coincide with your own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I live in Ontario and here PST is &quot;Provincial Sales Tax&quot;  it doesnt mean &quot;please send tell&quot; like these newer people think it does.<br />
<br />
Also, I was playing EQ for over two years before I saw the use of PST.  Two years of EQ without the need for PST.  Why would that change? I am just wondering as PST seems to imply the obvious (now there is a word for that).  Something that implies the obvious is uneeded, especially since you are using an abreviation of the phrase as it is.<br />
<br />
If you want to sell something say WTS [insert item name here], DO NOT stick PST on the end.  I am NOT going to spam the market channel or whatever channel that you 'might' be watching at the time with a &quot;you tell market: ' I'll buy that off ya' &quot;   that makes absolutely no sense at all.  I am going to /tell ya and talk to you that way.  I remember people using the public channels in the early days for auctions and price checks and discussions, but if you wanted to Buy something from someone, you sent a TELL.  IF you want to group with someone or ask them if they needed a group, you sent them a TELL.  People putting PST on the end of their statements or questions just make themselves look dumb for not realizing that sending them a tell is known to be the most efficient form of getting a response from a person or responding to them.  If someone doesnt know this, then they should very well be told or realize it cause I wont cater to them by putting PST on the end of my statements just so they know that they can reach me through tells.<br />

Unfortunately, it can only be said for American English, since in just about every other developed country students &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; undergo formalized education in spelling, grammar, and usage.  In the United States, most don't.  I bet many of the &quot;should of&quot; crowd would not even be able to explain to me why that phrase is pitifully wrong, or would not be able to explain simple grammar like the difference between &quot;had&quot; and &quot;have had&quot;.<br />

I think &quot;boot&quot; meaning footware came to English from French whereas &quot;loot&quot; came from Hindi.<br />

The logic is that &quot;boot&quot; refers to a single boot.   &quot;Loot,&quot; however, already refers to multiple items.   In essence, it isn't in singular form.  <br />

Then I think they have more than one type of plural (trying to remember what he told me) that indicates just how many, roughly, you're talking about.

As I understand it, in Japanese they have different ways to count based on whether you are counting animals, people, flat things (iirc that is strange but true), etc.<br />

Getting into the mindset of a language is very useful for learning it of course.    Understanding why you make those distinctions...<br />

That being said, things like &quot;ur,&quot; using numbers in place of letters (b4, etc.) still annoy the crap out of me.  Maybe it's not fair, but if someone uses &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot; they look dumb to me.  I know some people can't type that fast, but it's only two letters.  <br />

You can't have loots the same way you can't have milks, only pieces of loot and glasses of milk.  But I may have used the term loots before simply because it is part of the EQ vernacular.  I can't really remember.<br />
<br />
English is a really interesting language, but since it has taken words and phrases from so many other languages, it's completely inconsistent, which is probably why so many native speakers seem to have problems with it.  Another reason is that (at least where I live) grammar instruction is discontinued in high school and replaced with literature.  It was probably assumed that by high school, students should have a firm grasp of grammar, but sadly this is not the case.</div></div><hr />

You may recall the movement when many of  us had the anti PST avatar.  PST is the single most obnoxious thing people have done in public messages in EQ.  It implies that the reader is too stupid to properly communicate with you.  It is redundant, it is pointless and it is rude.<br />
<br />
Fortunately auctions are less common than they once were.  Unfortunately they all use PST in them.  <br />

I long for a better filtering system were I can send  any message with PST in it to the place it belongs.</div></div><hr />

It's like money.  You don't  say, &quot;I found monies today!&quot; If you find a quarter and a dime.  You would say, &quot;I found money&quot;.  Money is both plural and singular, just like loot is.</div></div><hr />

PST actually had some import 3 years ago.  Back then, auctioning for an item often did take place in /auc in whatever zone served as your market or bazaar.   Auctioning as in competitive bidding for an item in the /auc channel.   It was fun.<br />
<br />
If you didn't want an open auction, you added PST to indicate that you wanted a private tell from people with bids or offers.<br />

Of course, nowadays no one conducts a true auction anymore, so PST is superfluous.</div></div><hr />

ectunnlebot_01 tells you: Yeah like a real offer, you suxxors, I sell them for 76pp all the time.<br />

Perhaps I just didn't care as much back then :P<br />
<br />
At any rate, you don't loose a loose tooth.<br />
<br />
Also, another one I find interesting, though maybe a bit more understandable, is the word &quot;whose.&quot;  It's very rare that I ever actually see it used in the first place.  It seems like many people simply say &quot;who's&quot; universally because they sound similar.  &quot;Whose&quot; is the possessive of &quot;who&quot; however, whereas &quot;who's&quot; is a contraction of &quot;who is&quot; and &quot;who has.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is just as obnoxious for buyers to expect sellers to name their starting price.   After all, why shouldn't a buyer be equally prepared, and equally willing to name their starting offer?  <br />
<br />
The reason is because the person giving the starting offer (whether an offer to sell or to buy) is potentially at a disadvantage.  They may be revealing that they know little of the real range the item should go for.    For example, I am willing to sell item X for 5000 to 6000 pp, let's say.   A potential buyer comes along who is willing to pay 9000 to 10K.   If I go first with the top end of my range, 6000 pp, I've left thousands of pp on the table.   If they go first and lowball me (from their perspective) at 7000 pp or so, I know that I am likely to get several thousand more pp out of them (and THEY will have put more plat on the table than they needed to).<br />
<br />
Of course, in the game if I start I never go with the top end of my likely range....I add several thousand pp to that, so my opening offer would be, &quot;My wife and mistress both would kill me if I received less than 10K for this fine item X!&quot;<br />
<br />
We have a generation (or two or three) grown up on fixed price shopping, which is sad.   This is not Kmart.  Some of the most fun in buying something is bargaining the price up or down.   People who refuse to bargain at all are just no fun, and I usually decline to do business with them (unless their &quot;firm&quot; price is such a good deal I can't pass it up... :)</div></div><hr />

Plurals don't have an apostrophe: not even plural acronyms (it's &quot;I have 2 CPUs,&quot; not &quot;I have 2 CPU's.&quot;)<br />

<br />
Maybe its a locational thing.  The phrase &quot;I could care less&quot; is spoken in a specific manner which is indicative of the intended sarcasm.  In a similar manner in which &quot;That is soo bad&quot; is frequently used (or was frequently used, its dropped in usage recently in my circles) to indicate that something is good or &quot;awesome&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
Don't confused colloquial usage with illiteracy.  <br />
<br />
Further, don't assume that Americans so illiterate relative to the rest of the world.  The fact that the internet is so easily and cheaply accessible in the US means that regardless of education or a mere disregard for formal usage in a casual setting, people are able to speak out on the internet cheaply and easily.  This isn't so in most other nations.  <br />
<br />
I suspect that there are plenty of people in South America, or Northern Europe, or Western Asia, or wherever, who do not speak their language &quot;properly&quot;.  I also suspect that most of those languages are not a linguistically complicated and illogical as English.  I further suggest that many languages are not so stringently &quot;outlined&quot; as English.</div></div><hr />

<br />
u = you<br />
ur = you are/you're<br />
thx = thanks<br />
plz = please<br />
cuz = because<br />
k = ok<br />
wut = what<br />
keke = I think it's a chuckle emote<br />
<br />
I guess typing is such a chore that's it's just too damn difficult to type a couple extra letters.  The usage of 'u' instead of 'you' just makes me want to go postal.  It used to be relegated to eight year old boys on Counter Strike forums or bubble headed teenage valley girls in chat rooms.  Alas, it's becoming more and more common.  :mad:  I've seen postings from otherwise intelligent people employing 'u' sprinkled throughout entire paragraphs.  Even worse, sometimes they'll switch back and forth.  A sentence will have the proper identifier 'you' but a couple sentences later they revert to the bastardization 'u'.  Aaargh!   Reading that kind of crap gives me a headache.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, two other trends are dying off.  One is the 'l33t haxxor dOOd' speech with it's alternating caps and substitution of letters for numbers that was popular back in the mid-late 90's.  The other is the 'werd up homey G' talk by pasty white pencil-neck geeks trying to come off as being some sort of badass gangsta thug from the hood.  <br />

All in all, I guess the war against bad grammar in EQ and on the internet is being slowly won one battle at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gunny Burlfoot</div><div class="date">11-11-2003, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll have to chime in on this, because improper spelling of words and improper grammar usage irritates me enormously. I try not to let it show, but this seems the thread to air some of the frustrations of being around English-lazy people all day.<br />
<br />
I could make a very long list of things that some lesser beings twitch out of their keyboards, but many of my prime grievances have already been voiced in this thread.<br />
<br />
Anytime someone comes up to me and starts spouting off &quot;n e 1 got sumthing?&quot; that is not roleplaying a ogrish intelligence, immediately sets me off. I used to try to point out such things, but, unfortunately, I have been jaded and have gotten to the point where they are not worth correcting anyone. It's just too much trouble, and the porcine masses don't appreciate fine pearls anyway.<br />
<br />
However, I continually try not to judge people by their abysmal lack of proper spelling, punctuation, grammar, and have been surprised in several instances where the offending person is quite intelligent and thoughtful, but that is the exception that DOES prove the rule. <br />
<br />
Most of the people that are lazy enough about spelling and grammar in EQ, SWG, and any other chat based game have absolutely nothing worth taking up my time for. <br />
<br />
Most of them will never realize that in this new, online world, the average person's only way to establish, rightly or wrongly, your level of competence and intelligence is how you communicate the &quot;written&quot; (typed) word. There are no obvious visual or audial clues that this person may not be worth your time in an online encounter. Moving about EQ with such pithy sayings as &quot;dud i will pay u 20 fro por t now!1!&quot; is the equivalent of moving through the real world with a long white string of drool dangling from your chin indefinitely.<br />
<br />
As to the charge of America's schools being subpar, I will have to sadly agree. Not because of the money we spend, not because of any lack of teacher motivation, not even because of the gang-style violence that seems to be moving from urban to suburban schools. A properly motivated child, as long as he/she has library access, will be able to educate themselves. It is first and foremost because most of the drones out there having children have never realized the awesome responsibility of raising a child correctly. <br />
<br />
When a couple becomes a mother and a father, their whole lives should change direction. Everything should be secondary to raising the child to become another productive member of society. It means for 18 years at least, you have no &quot;your time&quot;. Period. If you can't hack devoting your entire life to the advancement of another being, then you should not have kids at all. Society would benefit more from having less overall people than having more spoiled, narcisstic, morally bereft brats. (which then find their way on to EQ to annoy me! :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
That's my 0.02 cp anyhow!<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</div></div><hr />

Those statements aren't contradictory.  Yes, in the case of higher learning, the United States has &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; great universities and research centers that are among the best in the world.  But when it comes to basic education, the United States falls way behind in the world.  When you look at inner city education, it's beyond pathetic.  They're about guns and drugs, not education.  Students can &quot;graduate&quot; high school without even knowing how to read, write, or do basic arithmetic.<br />
<br />
Show me a U.S. secondary school curriculum that includes mandatory, separate courses in grammar, literature, and foreign language, like you'd typically find in many foreign schools.  If you look, you'll probably see &quot;English&quot; courses which are patchwork literature/writing courses taught by teachers who barely have a grasp on the topics themselves.  It's no coincidence that students taught in the past 10-20 years have little grasp of spelling or grammar.<br />
<br />
Also, how many schools in the United States have strict mandatory exit exams, like you would commonly find in foreign school?  When they tried to implement a basic exit exam requirement in California, the whole thing got stalled because many students couldn't possibly pass the basic test covering English and math at (barely) a high school level.<br />

edit: Also, Gunny: you sound like an adult who is out of the educational system. Im a senior at a public high school in the US, that doesn't have enough money to keep all of its athletic team and academic teams going. You may say that its not a lack of teacher motivation, or lack of money, or even the &quot;gang style violence&quot; (that gave me a laugh btw.) However, you are incorrect.<br />
<br />
Every day I face the fact that I can't read the books that are given to me, because they are so old and worn out that half the pages are missing. My school doesn't have enough money to buy new books, therefore my learning, and my classmates learning is affected.<br />
<br />
Teachers aren't motivated to teach. An average teacher of mine comes into class in the beginning of first semester, and gives us a week by week syllibus of what will be taught for the year. They will then procede to bombard us with handouts and assignments. Of which they have us read aloud in class, and call that teaching. <br />
<br />
Also, A majority of the teachers at my school have student teachers from local colleges, that don't know how to teach, yet are expected to teach instead of the teacher.<br />
You mention gang style violence...HELLO!!!! teenagers will always try and cause trouble, and to stereotype children of a public education as causing this trouble is rediculous. Try going to a private school with a tuition of 18 grand a year, and tell me if they don't have students who start fights.<br />
<br />
Sorry for ranting, but i find it rediculous that people who aren't actually in a system are droning on and on about their beliefs. If you want to pass judgement on why teenagers and public high school students in America are so illiterate, please come to my school and take a tour instead of spoiting an opinion that you have made from watching the news or reading the paper.<br />

<br />
Well I don't think it is. You can usually see how mature and smart one is, by how they spell words, construct sentences, and generally seem to understand what they say.<br />
<br />
People make mistakes. I make mistakes. However, most mistakes are obvious. Someone who manages to spell the same word differently 4 times in the same sentence, or someone who doesn't seem to have the slightest clue about the expressions they use, because they only try to look good by reusing words they heard elsewhere, I will simply deem not worthy of my communicating with, simply because my time is precious, so I'd rather have instantaneous intelligible communication than losing my time trying to make a moron understand things they probably won't care about anyway, since it doesn't pertain to &quot;phat lewts&quot; (which IS the EQ plural of &quot;loot&quot;, by the way ;) ).<br />
<br />
Plus, my primary language isn't english, so it always makes me sad to meet people obvioulsy from the USA (or the UK since I moved to Antonius Bayle), who actually seem to be less skilled at english than I am. Although I may sometimes misinterpret things half said into mistakes, due to the fact that I don't actually (nor won't pretend to) master the language (such as the &quot;I could care less&quot; thing... this thing always irked me for some reason, because it makes no sense at all... now it apparently  is correct in some parts of the world, although I'm not sure most people use it in the way described in this thread).<br />
<br />
To be fair, I have to say that the problem isn't only with the USA, but with internet, since we're having the very same problem here in France. It seems that as soon as people get to use the 'net, their IQ drops to abysmal levels, and they have to use chat lingo and phonic spelling, as if using a &quot;different&quot; (yet the same, but misused) language would instantly tag them as part of the internet population (I bet some studies have already been made on the subject). <br />
<br />
So, to me, it's more a sociologic rather than cultural problem (although I understand the internet abbreviations do appeal to people with cultural problems... why waste time understand how a word should be spelt, when it's always abbreviated down to 2 letters anyway?). I'd still prefer to talk to someone who can actually communicate, or even try to, and look down on those who make no effort at all. Might be just me though.<br />

Without wishing to turn this into a &quot;America is great all bow before her: America sucks&quot; debate.  I have 4 kids in the American public (state) school system.  One of the reasons I wont be extending my time here is PRECISELY because of the poor quality of the education, and not just the 3R teaching but also the truly awful cultural indoctrination.  That said, I fully expect and hope that they will return here (or perhaps the UK) for their post graduate education because of the fine university system.</div></div><hr />

AAARG.  All the stupid acronyms drive me nuts.  You can hear an audible groan from the english teacher's graves over the grammatical atrocities commited daily while online.<br />

I have learned to cope, though.  If you ever try to help anyone spell better or use a word properly they just get offended.  So I let them go on believing they are right until it is important one day and they are writing that way on a real paper at work.  Then it will suddenly become more important.</div></div><hr />

While that may be true in most if not all public school systems, many private high schools in this country in fact do have these  requirements.  I went through the public school system until attending college and I managed to take three years of Russian and two years of French before graduating, so while not required, at least in some systems opportunities are present if the student will take advantage of them.  Having said all that, I do agree that in all public schools taking a foreign language should be a requirement.<br />

Aidon,  you defend your educational system, yet you slump in one of the worlds most educated, richest and advanced part  (Northern Europe - Scandinavia) together with South America and similar places. What does that tell  us about your education?<br />

Usually it is the people from Scandinavia who you can expect to have atleast some resemblance of decent grammar and spelling. Both with english and their native language. Scandinavian basic education is top of the world and far beyond U.S. basic education - which you would know if you had some of that education you seem to appreciate so much.<br />

It is true that you do have excellent centers for higher learning but how many of the students/professionals in those places are foreigners or 1st-2nd generation americans?

As far as to the linguistically complicated, I'd suggest you check out languages like finnish or swedish (Scandinavian languages). They may not be quite as simple as you seem to think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Further, your suggestion that my grammar is off in that statement, isn't entirely true.<br />
<br />
I went to a few of them.  Ok.  Sounds good.<br />
<br />
Didn't see a single gun in there.  (In where? In school, inferred.  Noone ever says &quot;In schools&quot; when refering to the period when they were &quot;in school&quot;.  Everyone goes to multiple schools while they are in &quot;in school&quot;.  The usage in the context was correct.)<br />
<br />
Must have been freak of nature because the Media never exaggerates... ( aside from the fact that I left an A out, another typographical error, this is in proper tense.  The IT before Must is inferred.  It is singular.  What is It?  The fact that there were no guns in school where I went to school.)<br />

Ok, to start.<br />
<br />
I was picking geographical areas almost at random.  And to be honest, Latvia(Which is in Northern Europe..even though is isn't Scandinavian) or isn't much ahead of (if it is at all) Brazil, or South Africa, or Israel (to choose representative nations from the other areas I mentioned). <br />
<br />
I'm glad Scandinavian education is so fine.  Its not the purpose of discussion here.  As I've never set foot there, I can't really be certain.<br />
<br />
I do know, however, you see more people coming from overseas to attend The Ohio State University than the University of Goteborg or Tampere.<br />
<br />
Finally, I wasn't suggesting that Dutch, or Norsk, or Swedish, or Lappian, or Finnish, etc. were simple languages.  They are certainly more simple than English.  English simply is an obtuse, overlarge language lacking in logical usage.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to agree, to an extent.<br />
<br />
People who can't be *bothered* to look after their writing abilities don't honestly get a great deal of sympathy from me.  <br />
<br />
But as someone who works for a charitable organisation helping to raise the potential of disadvantaged and disabled people who *want* to better themselves, I've seen a fair few people who... okay they may not even be able to sign their own name.  Maybe they never will be able to, for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
But they're by no means &quot;lesser beings&quot;.  Most of them are as intelligent as anyone else, and those who have learning difficulties can still find their strengths and realise their potential.  They're still held in as high regard as anyone else, and they're still fun and compassionate people to talk to.<br />
<br />
Even ignorance to such detail can be helped.  I guess that's what some of this thread is for.  Some people don't understand the necessity to communicate in a standard manner on a global network.  That's not always their fault if the necessity has never been explained to them.  Those that don't care however....<br />
<br />
(Mildaene): Someone who manages to spell the same word differently 4 times in the same sentence, or someone who doesn't seem to have the slightest clue about the expressions they use, because they only try to look good by reusing words they heard elsewhere, I will simply deem not worthy of my communicating with<br />

Interesting.  It just goes to show that education isn't gospel, it changes depending on the location like anything else.<br />
<br />
This doesn't make either of us &quot;correct&quot; really, but...<br />
<br />
In IBT2 and IBT3 last year I was taught the opposite; a double space is required when typing, and when writing it's irrelevant, since a pen doesn't have a 'space bar'.  Most people leave a reasonable gap between sentences when writing, and the reasoning behind a double-space in typing is to duplicate this for clarity when someone's reading it. <br />
<br />
This is backed up by my mother, who learned to touch-type on a typewriter many moons ago and was taught exactly the same thing (long before computers were found in homes).  Same reasoning, and even more important since typewriter characters were all fixed-width.</div></div><hr />

It's true that when I see someone completely butcher some words, my first thought will be &quot;he's stupid&quot; rather than &quot;he's dyslexic&quot;. You'll admit there must be an immense challenge playing a game where the main mean of communication is completely closed to you. Now I'm not sure about the importance of dyslexia in the EQ population, but I doubt (and may be wrong) that that many dyslexic people play (especially compared to the number of people who find it cool to spell the words differently and people who just don't want to make any effort).<br />

How about list the starting line ups for the New York Mets from 1954 - 1959 and then argue which line up had the best records from memory? Are you able to do Cubic Equations in your head? Well, I can't either, but I've know friends who can do one or more of these.<br />
<br />
I KNOW history, while I personally hate how stupid most people are about even basic historical facts they should have learned in high school, I don't go out of my way to correct them if they are close. <br />
<br />
You all have a skill, great, but one of the niffty things about english is how it is always changing. We invent new words and change the meanings of old words all the time. Dictionaries don't aways catch every new word, some go out of use too soon, but no matter what, we are winning! As the world gets smaller, english will continue to grow and expand. ALOT of people are being exposed to english for the 1st real time on the internet. (I don't count alot of what schools in any country teach as really learning a language. I've studied German and french in HS/college. I learned more in the few months I spent in germany in the army then I did in 3-4 years of school. In college I got to know a number of foreign students and from what they told me, their learning of english in school wasn't much better.)<br />
<br />
English has ALOT of stupid rules and spellings that make NO sense. Engrish on the other hand :) likes to cut through the BS and spell things like they sound and avoid typing more then really necessary.<br />
<br />
Hell, necessary is a perfect example of a stupid spelling. Pronunciation: 'ne-s&amp;-&quot;ser-E. Why the hell don't we spell it nesesere?<br />
<br />
Well, starting to ramble now. <br />
<br />
p.s. I h8 u all. Keke silly babo? :boohoo:<br />
p.s.s I will admit to hating PST too. I usually ask them in /ooc, /auc etc what if I'm in EST or something? Can I buy it too? Usually that will start others heckling them and I can go away happy!</div></div><hr />

I'll bet most American students can't do any of the above, in addition to not knowing how to properly read and write in their native language.  What is your point exactly?  A basic command of your native written language shouldn't be an &lt;i&gt;optional&lt;/i&gt; skill like quantum physics!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Many of the countries which have superior education systems, also choose the tracks which students follow during their educational career.<br />
<br />
What I mean is, if a person has no aptitude for upper division, they are routed to menial professions.<br />
<br />
The person really has no choice for &quot;going to college&quot; like we do in the US.<br />
<br />
Most US citizens would burn down the schools before they would let that happen.  If I say as a parent, Johnny or Joanie is going to college, then that is the way they will track.  Not some bureaucrat who thinks that they will be better off changing sparkplugs for the rest of their lives.<br />
<br />
So before anyone starts the US schools suck compared to the rest of the world,  (which they do),  remember how most of the countries who you are comparing against actually 'educate' their people.<br />
<br />
Here in California, we spend over $150K to educate a classroom of students(K-12).  Even the longer of tenured of teachers gets only 50K a year.  That leaves 100K, on a good day, unaccounted for.<br />
<br />
That is the question we should be asking.</div></div><hr />

I never said they couldn't play well. I just don't like to group with them. In my experience, people who use those sort of terms tend to be rude players. I've learned my lesson in that area.

okay thats not the best example, but sadly it is quite common here in american among my age group (senior in highschool). I really dont see it as a problem myself because the actual homosexuals (and i know a couple) do not seem to take any real offense to this, because they know its not a derogative pertaining to their lifestyle.<br />
<br />
Also regarding the US school system... well here in california, its pretty sad. Ive been lucky enough to be admitted into a charter school that just started up, and is filled with more knowledged students, however before I came to this highschool, there were still students having trouble to read in the 8th grade, which i find immensly problematic, seeing as it is far from a small minority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's mighty white of you....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Those of you old enough to recognize that the above statement is derogatory and racist, I hope, get my point.  <br />
<br />
For those who don't recognize it, the word &quot;white&quot; refers to Caucasians (&quot;white people&quot;), and was used in the U.S. not too long ago to compliment someone for being generous, good, nice, etc.   It derives its meaning from the stereotype that people with black skin are shiftless, lazy, untrustworthy, apt to steal, etc.   <br />
<br />
I'm sure that some folks 40 and 50 years ago meant &quot;no real insult&quot; to blacks by this use of the term &quot;white.&quot;   After all, they were only complimenting someone, right?  Hardly.<br />
<br />
The current use of the word &quot;gay&quot; is similarly derogatory.  It derives its meaning ONLY THROUGH its relationship to a certain minority.  In this case, instead of skin color, it's based on sexual preference.   <br />
<br />
And yes, every time I hear this phrase used now, my mental image of the speaker is the same as Artemisian's above.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, we aren't talking about a new meaning for the word &quot;gay&quot; here.

<br />
'la' is complete meaningless word habitually appended toward the end of a sentence in Oriental cultures, especially the Chinese. I don’t think it’s inherent to the Japanese though, they are more likely to say ‘ne’. It isn’t any different from the way Canadians append ‘eh’, or how an inner city American kid is likely to slap a ‘yo’ at the end of saying something completely mundane. That is to say, “I prefer the red, yo” works just the same as “I prefer the red, la”.<br />
<br />
‘ABC’ is actually an acronym for ‘American Born Chinese’.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I'd like to toss in my agreement with the above posters. I think less of a person if they use words which tie strongly into the identity of a heavily discriminated-against group of people. I have personally been told to 'not be such a nigger' (by a claiming-a-camp-from-the-zone-in-with-no-group Dr00d, no less) and that caused me some irritation.</div></div><hr />

I never heard of suck associated with homosexuals, nor blow nor bite.  In my mind it was once associated wtih fellatio, but didn't have any specific genders attached to it. Perhaps I missed out on that one, I'll have to ask my San Francisco friends next time I see them.<br />
<br />
Homosexuals use queer and gay to describe themselves.  They coopted queer taking a negative label and wearing it proudly.  <br />
<br />
But despite  some people using &quot;gay&quot; in a negative sense to mean something bad they don't like, I think most people associate &quot;gay&quot; with homosexuals.  So 'gay' might have changed meaning in a few people's minds, but there's a lot of us out there that still associate the term with homosexuals.</div></div><hr />

You'll agree, then, that the use of the words Lame and Retarded is a direct insult directed at the handicapped then?<br />
<br />
It's not the same thing at all.  As an insult, &quot;retarded&quot; is used to convey that the person is mentally deficient.  As for &quot;lame&quot;, its dictionary meaning is &quot;weak&quot; or &quot;ineffectual&quot;, and can be used to describe either an ineffectual body part (in the case of the handicapped) or anything else (e.g., a lame excuse).  In both cases, you're using the word for its intended meaning.<br />
<br />
However, using &quot;gay&quot; to mean &quot;bad&quot; is a precise mirror of Scirocco's example of using &quot;white&quot; to mean good.  There's an extra analogy where you implicitly state that group X is bad, and because I'm comparing this to group X, it must be bad too.<br />
<br />
As a side note, the word &quot;ghey&quot; has cropped up recently to temper the bigoted use of &quot;gay&quot;.  A compromise position.</div></div><hr />

in regards to the use of &quot;gay&quot;, i think generally it is not refered to in the homosexual manner, but more in a flambouyant &quot;fruity&quot; attitude, more related to steretypical homosexual activity. I must admit that I am guilty of throwing around the word gay in an unproper manner, however meaning no real insults. <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that's mighty white of you....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Those of you old enough to recognize that the above statement is derogatory and racist, I hope, get my point.  <br />
<br />
For those who don't recognize it, the word &quot;white&quot; refers to Caucasians (&quot;white people&quot;), and was used in the U.S. not too long ago to compliment someone for being generous, good, nice, etc.   It derives its meaning from the stereotype that people with black skin are shiftless, lazy, untrustworthy, apt to steal, etc.   <br />
<br />
I'm sure that some folks 40 and 50 years ago meant &quot;no real insult&quot; to blacks by this use of the term &quot;white.&quot;   After all, they were only complimenting someone, right?  Hardly.<br />
<br />
The current use of the word &quot;gay&quot; is similarly derogatory.  It derives its meaning ONLY THROUGH its relationship to a certain minority.  In this case, instead of skin color, it's based on sexual preference.   <br />
<br />
And yes, every time I hear this phrase used now, my mental image of the speaker is the same as Artemisian's above.  <br />
<br />
Actually, my understanding is the term &quot;Mighty white of you&quot; was actually more of a British term from its colonial heyday.  Same essential premise, though the contrasting race differed depending on which part of the empire you were in.<br />
<br />
As for gay...I'm of two minds on that one.  While personally, I haven't yet found a use for the word in my functional vocabulary, the word has had such varied meaning over the years, far predating the time when certain members of the homosexual community co-opted the word, that I find it difficult to fault a new colloquial meaning of &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;asinine&quot;.  The fact remains that gay wasn't a derogatory term arbitrarily given to homosexuals.  Its meanings over the years have drifted from &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;jubilant&quot;,  to indicating a man who liked to drink and carouse to excess, to being used to denote promiscuity, to being adopted by the gay community as their own title, to being used in place of something which didn't go well, was asinine, or just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Then again...I don't use the word, I strive not to use any phrase which could construed as bigoted (for the most part, certain cultural disdains and hatreds still run strong in my blood).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tuda, you *are* aware that both of these words (retarded and lame) are considered insulting by the members of their respective communities, right?  (It is considered more sensitive to use the terms mentally handicapped and ambulatorily challenged, respectively).<br />
<br />
The use of these words, in any context, is akin to calling a black kitten a N***er.  &quot;What? Its black, after all! I'm using the word in its approriate context!&quot;<br />
<br />
Aside from which, when a person refers to their opponent in an internet debate as a &quot;retard&quot; they dont actually mean &quot;You have a trisomy in chromosome 21&quot;.. they mean &quot;You're stupid&quot;.  Which is quite another meaning entirely.  Likewise, when someone refers to the PWoE ring as &quot;lame&quot; they dont mean that this ring event has to use a cane when it walks.  They mean its stupid and not fun.  Again, an entirely different meaning for a word which is offensive to some.<br />
<br />
(The analogy to the word &quot;gay&quot; is quite simple here.  When someone describes the new targetting ring as &quot;gay&quot; they dont mean that this targetting ring has sex with otehr targetting rings of the same gender, and you @#$% well know it.  They mean its silly, unnecessary, and not aesthetically appealing).<br />
<br />
Its pretty simple - lame and retarded are directly analagous to gay.  Either accept that words have more than one meaning, and these meanings change with time, or cease the use of the words reatred and lame as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd have a point, *if* being gay was defined only as having sex with someone of the same gender, but &quot;gay&quot; in this context is not a verb; rather, it is an adjective used to describe a sexual orientation. When you use the word &quot;gay&quot; to describe something, manner of usage is the same (adjective). If the object of that description is obviously negative, the implication is therefore: &quot;(this thing) is as bad as being (homosexual).&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree that words can change in meaning over time. However, it seems silly to try justifying a particularly derogatory application of a word by claiming that you're assuming its past or future meaning(s). For instance, you know no one would assume you meant to say the object being described was &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;festive.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the other pet peeves expressed in this thread ... what bugs me the most is unnecessary abbreviations like &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ne1&quot;. In my opinion, these reflect pure laziness, not an absence of typing skill. <br />
<br />
If people would just type the full word every time, they'd soon discover that you takes practically the same amount of time to type as u. Commonly used words, regardless of length, are typed by rote rather than by their individual letters. Of course this also explains why our fingers occasionally substitute &quot;there&quot; for &quot;their&quot; even when our heads know better. ;)<br />

Of course that doesnt really matter though.  What matters is the fact that the words &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;retarded&quot; are being held to completely different standards that are utterly inconsistent.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the moral of all this is not to assume any meaning behind a word until you see/hear it in context.  That might include other words in the sentence/discussion, the environment and happenings around whoever said it, emotions, body language etc.<br />
<br />
In online communication, it's even more difficult to tell what that context is; hence we have 'smileys' or 'emoticons.'  They might've started out as an ASCII gimmick, but have actually turned out to be a useful tool for conveying the intention or meaning of a sentence/comment than people tend to realise.<br />

<br />
When people says &quot;so dumb!&quot; that is generally accepted as slang meaning something they think lacks sense (or lacks 'a sense'), but still not targeting an individual or community in a negative way. On the other hand, if people went around saying &quot;so Aldarion!&quot; whenever they were referring to something they obviously disliked, that would be a derogatory slur of a word currently used to identify an individual. People who like the person they associate with that name, might take offense at such negative usage.<br />

thats an interesting point - the fact that the word gay is used by a certain &quot;culture&quot; (sic) to describe themselves in a non-negative way, while the same cannot be said of the word &quot;retarded&quot;.  You have a point.<br />
<br />
However, it must be pointed out that this particular word was intentionally co-opted by said &quot;culture&quot;.  The meaning was intentionally changed in order to give their &quot;lifestyle&quot; positive connotations previously reserved for the former meaning (happy and lighthearted).<br />
<br />
The fact that people come out in this massive outpouring of support for these &quot;poor, persecuted people who are being so insulted by this term&quot; only shows that theyve succeeded in deliberately changing the meaning of a word and forcing society to accomodate them.  Meanwhile, no such sympathy exists for the ambulatorily challenged or the mentally handicapped, apparently.  Homosexuality has been deified to a truly amazing extent.. to the point that the word they intentionally changed the meaning of now evokes stronger emotions in the average person than words used to describe people who actually do face hardships in life.<br />
<br />
It is surprising that people dont object to being manipulated to this extent.  Does no one examine their motivations anymore?</div></div><hr />

I don't see how that makes a bit of difference to what Firemynd was saying.  Used to be blacks called themselves colored people, or negros too, but they changed words.  Big deal.  <br />
<br />
You're trying to use the fact they call themselves a word to justify why it's ok to then take that word and apply it to something negative.  That just doesn't wash.  If you started saying &quot;That's so [black, jew, druid, white,  asian, catholic, whatever]&quot; to mean something negative, you're going to offend the group that associates with that label, no matter how or why they acquired that label.<br />
<br />
I think your dislike of homosexuals is the basis of your argument, not whether or not it's insulting to coopt a word a group uses to describe themselves and use it to mean something negative.</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, the gay community didn't exactly scour the dictionary looking for just the right word to call its own. ;)<br />
<br />
Reference to same-gender partnering, not necessarily sexual, was adapted from 'geycat' (a young hobo who acted as a lookout for an older one) and writers began using &quot;gay&quot; as early as 1890 to obfuscate their intended meaning and avoid censorship.<br />
<br />
As with other labels used to single them out (usually in a negative way, e.g. homosexuals thrown into Nazi concentration camps and forced to wear 'pink triangles' to distinguish them from other types of prisoners) ...  over time, the gay community apparently adopted the most common non-sexual descriptor given them by straight press. I suppose anything was more appropriate than the term &quot;homosexual,&quot; acknowledging that one's sexual orientation cannot be defined strictly by sexual activity -- one can certainly classify his or her own orientation long before actually having sexual contact with another person.<br />
<br />
More of a mystery is the origin of referencing heterosexuals as &quot;straights&quot;.. but the inference that anything 'not straight' is 'crooked', would be a whole other can of worms... :D<br />

I actually disagree with this.  A child needs adults who love it and look out for it's welfare.  They don't need to be of any particular gender.  I've talked to kids that had gay parents, who are straight btw, and they said their family lives were just fine.<br />

This argument doesn't apply to the use of &quot;gay.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Most, if not all, of my gay friends use the term freely to describe themselves, and don't object to the term being used to describe them by others.  <br />
<br />
The issue is when some teenaged boys start using the word &quot;gay&quot; in a derogatory fashion to mean &quot;strange,&quot; &quot;wierd,&quot; &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;perverted,&quot; etc.   And the only reason it has that derogatory meaning is precisely because it has previously been used for decades to refer to homosexuals.<br />

Honestly, I have never heard any female use the term in the manner discuused.  And I've never heard any male near my age range use it, either.  The only ones I've ever heard (or seen) use it I know to be young males in their teens and young 20-somethings (in other words, only a few years removed from being pimply-faced teenage boys...at my age, there's little difference...;)</div></div><hr />

I want to know why certain groups feel its ok for them to coop a word they find derogatory towards them, start using it amongst themselves, and yet still claim its offensive if anyone else uses it?<br />
Homosexuals using Gay and Queer.<br />
Since when is &quot;gay&quot; derogatory?  That's pretty much both of the official and colloquial term around here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This argument doesn't apply to the use of &quot;gay.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Most, if not all, of my gay friends use the term freely to describe themselves, and don't object to the term being used to describe them by others.  <br />
<br />
The issue is when some teenaged boys start using the word &quot;gay&quot; in a derogatory fashion to mean &quot;strange,&quot; &quot;wierd,&quot; &quot;stupid,&quot; &quot;perverted,&quot; etc.   And the only reason it has that derogatory meaning is precisely because it has previously been used for decades to refer to homosexuals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be gay&quot; translates into &quot;Don't be like a homosexual, i.e., strange, wierd, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this really escape you?  <br />
<br />
No, it doesn't.  <br />
<br />
I was more referring to the term &quot;Queer&quot;.  My understanding is that calling a homosexual a &quot;Queer&quot; is about on par as calling a Black a &quot;Nigger&quot; or calling a Hispanic a &quot;Spic&quot;.  Yet, I see the term bandied about amongst homosexuals with growing frequency.<br />
<br />
Its simply something I don't understand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the concept of a minority community taking the sting out of a negative word by polarizing its usage. The more frequently a word is presented and seen in a positive way by the people it's intended to offend, the less inclined others are to use that word when they want to evoke negativity.<br />
<br />
However, I don't see why anyone would compare those words with 'gay' .... because 'gay' has never been used negatively. <br />
<br />
Instead of trying to compare 'gay' to words that have been used as slurs like n-gger, sp-c, or ch-nks, try to see it in the same light as other minority descriptors that aren't viewed as slurs... like asian or jewish.  If EQ players suddenly started saying &quot;oh man that's jewish!&quot; when referring to something bad, I think you might see the point about &quot;that's gay&quot; a little more clearly. <br />
<br />
But evidently, it's more socially acceptable to make gays the object of such slang -- surprisingly, more acceptable even among those in minority groups who you'd think would be a little more intolerant of slurs in any form.<br />

<br />
Some do, or perhaps you missed my earlier posts about that.  For example, in /ooc about 6 months back I heard a necro say, &quot;Hey, who jewed all the frogs?!&quot;   I'm sure you will agree that is the use of the term &quot;Jew&quot; in a way which is bad (if you don't, you're hopeless, and I'll give up trying to discuss this topic with you...:)<br />
<br />
You don't hear it as much because it gets stomped out pretty quickly.  Perhaps because bigotry towards gays is acceptable to more people than bigotry towards Jews.</div></div><hr />

No, someone who uses a word which is commonly associated with a minority group to describe 'something bad', is a bigot. <br />

<br />
It has so many different meanings.  (here's a few).<br />
<br />
1) Does minority mean the opposite of majority?<br />
The county I live in has 38 percent Latino/as.  There are no other groups with that many people.  Does that mean that Caucasians are a minority?<br />
<br />
2) Less than 50%?<br />
Hard to get a majority these days; 50+% of something, that is.  So is less than 50% a criterion.<br />
<br />
3) Do you mean something else when you use the word 'minority'?  For example, women are usually lumped into the minorities group, even though there are more women than men.  Is the term(both words) 'minority group', what you mean?  Is 'minority' just an adjective, or is it part of the noun?<br />
<br />
4) By your sentence, it would imply that you can use words of 'majorities' negatively.  To paraphrase Scirocco, &quot;That's mighty Christian of you&quot;.   And I would not be a bigot for saying that?  Or even more simply, if a gay(homosexual, minority) person refers to me(heterosexuals, majority) as a 'breeder', he would not be a bigot?<br />
<br />
What do YOU mean when you say 'minority'.</div></div><hr />

Yes, on the fence in front of a school I pass by almost every day is:<br />

Proud 2B Drug Free<br />
<br />
Seems they are also proud to be proper English free as well.<br />
<br />
And this isn't just some random student failure to know English, this message was put there by the school (although they probably forced the students to do the work).<br />
<br />
Every few months, they change it slightly, although it always says something about how you shouldn't do drugs.<br />
<br />
While I am in favor of schools teaching kids you don't need to do drugs, is that all that they are teaching?<br />
<br />
No, I think they are also teaching them to rat out their parents or anyone else they see doing drugs also, but I can't confirm that.  <br />
<br />
Things like proper English, math, history or being proud to not to do violence seem to be secondary priorities.</div></div><hr />

English changes 'cause it ain't dead.  If you're still using the same English you were taught in school, I hope you're under, say, 25, 'cause otherwise you're probably out of date.<br />
