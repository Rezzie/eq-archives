<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ducati</div><div class="date">07-16-2006, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there! This is my first time in the 7 years I've played EQ that I'm on an actual forum asking for help. It seems like a really nice community over here, so I figured I'd give this a shot.<br />
 <br />
As my title says, it's been a year and a half since I've really played (one year officially; 6 months of on and off play time). I reached level 70 and I'm working on Dranik faction (at kindly). I'm guildless, and my equipment in short really isn't what it used to be. I did at one point have a 1.5 epic, elemental armor, etcetera until I had a hacking problem and it wasn't replaced....but that's a different story. And I don't have a guild or many gamefriends on at this point in time to assist me in regaining any of those things (Last 2 fights into 1.5 though! I guess that's a good thought)<br />
 <br />
Anyway, I'm just curious as to what a currently solo druid should do for improvement at this point lacking 3 out of the 11 expanions (aka: everything past OoW). I don't have extra funds at this point to buy any of them either. It may be a month or so. Any suggestions would be appreciated. <br />
 <br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

That's a pretty good deal, even cheaper than getting the 3 you're missing individually.<br />
 <br />
As for soloing, one of the best spots still are the tables in Plane of Fire, if you have access. Other than that, you need Depths of Darkhollow to get the good 69.1 mission for soloing.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for that tidbit on the titanium edition. I haven't been to Compusa or otherwise for a long time, so I never even heard of any of that. Too involved with cars and college.<br />
 <br />
I have access to PoF. Tables are usually camped, and when I do go there it's really just lame experience. What about equipment wise though (except the dranik faction things)? Or has Sony just made it more difficult to be solo as their expansions kept coming out?<br />
 <br />
...And is it even worth it to purchase the PoR expansion too, or just keep it titanium?<br />
 <br />
So damn well curious.<br />
Thanks! :)</div></div><hr />

PoR is pretty heavy on the grouping though, not a whole lot of solo spots that I've found.  The DoD mission 69.1 is 15% per kill on hard, and pretty easy to solo once you break the first camp of 3 mobs (snare one and zone out to single pull the camp easily) and has no respawns for the 6 hours you can have the instance.</div></div><hr />

It has nice quests but I think you'll have plenty to deal with by just adding DoN and DoD. Both have lots of accessible gear options - DoN via crystals at the merchants and DoD via mission rewards. DoN merchants are a quick way to patch armour slots and fill in a missing focus and you can sell all the items back to the merchant as you progress. It's fairly easy to get a group to do a creator and pick up a few crystals, or if you have plat they are tradeable and at least on BB very cheap in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />
