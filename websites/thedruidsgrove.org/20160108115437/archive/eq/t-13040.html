<br />
I have a question tho. What in your opinion is the best way to level without getting power leveled? I took the advice of another poster here and went to East Karana to fight the Reavers at level 15, it worked great, I am now level 18.<br />
<br />
So where next?<br />
<br />
My brother has played the game for a while now and gave me some gear, he says I am now &quot;mildly twinked&quot;. He also gave my Ranger 500 plat to buy some gear as well. He is only level 10.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo...thanks in advance for any advice you can give me.</div></div><hr />

Are you looking to solo mostly, or group up with some folks?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Groups center around the same areas however, with most players shifting location as expansions are released.  This is not however, true for the lower level game, which has not seen drastic increases in content for some time.<br />
<br />
Pudaral Caverns would be good for you, if you want to solo, nearly any zone within that level range may be decent.  As both the Ranger and Druid are outdoors classes, you would probly be better off avoiding dungeons while soloing until you are more aware of what you can and can not do.<br />

Just say its your first time playing the game and people will understand. If you were a lvl 70 playing the game for the first time then you should be worried lol :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">01-05-2006, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where to hunt: For somebody, the ones that give faster exp are good camps; for others, they would consider safety first and rather accept slower exp. I am of the latter category, so my definition for a good camp is one with a) All static spawns and b) single pulls. I hate trains so if there are other people hunting in the same zone I'll make sure they don't cause me problems before start hunting. Also I don't like 'named' mobs to spawn too frequently since they are much tougher and will slow exp. So it is not strange that I prefer Paludal Caverns (5-23), Echo Cavern (24-31, 45-48), Gunthak gulf, Jaggered pine (32-40), Crystal Caverns, Timorous Deep (49-53) and such.<br />
 <br />
How to hunt (solo): druids can melee till around level 30 using Damage shields, and this tactic improves your general defense skill (the hardest skill to raise). So use it. From 31-52 you have several choices and it's a lot of fun: quad-kite, charm/charm-fear kite, root-dot+DS, etc. Use this period to travel around the world and experiment different tactics. After level 53 charm-kite in planes is the fastest till 65. Then you probably need to switch to root-dot till 70.<br />
 <br />
Exp goes slower in later levels. however from level 58 it'll be easier to find a group (as healer). So generally speaking, the slowest exp comes between 53-57, unless you decide to solo all the way to 70 (like me).</div></div><hr />

Eventually you are gonna want to group with people.  Get some of those rookie mistakes out of your system while you are lower level and most likely grouped with a bunch of twinked out characters.  Since they are twinked and the content is easy for them it is easier to survive the mistakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">01-06-2006, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is absolutely correct, you will someday want to group in any case...so learn the basics now.<br />
<br />
Explain to people that you are new to the game, the ones who believe you are likely to be quite helpful with advice. ( do take care to watch for anyone offering to sell you an item at really great prices once they find you are new)<br />
<br />
You need to both learn the game system and you need to learn how to play your character classes.  The game takes a while to learn- there are a lot of little things that you only find over time.  Thats the part you want to learn from groups.  Learning your classes is something you can do fine solo or grouped.<br />

I got there by fighting solo in the Karanas.  In South Karana I found a large chicken roost that gave me ample things to kill...I just had to avoid the Avocets.  :)<br />
<br />
So now I am going to try to find a decent place where I can hook up with groups.</div></div><hr />

As you enter your upper twenties and thirties some suggestions would be start to look for LDON missions as they are available and DSP.  There are some good leveling guides as to where to hunt and all available if you do a little searching around.</div></div><hr />
