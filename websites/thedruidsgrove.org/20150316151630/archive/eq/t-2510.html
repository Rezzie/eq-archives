<br />
I've finally completely the first version of the Druid's Grove General Hunting Guide for Levels 1-60.<br />
<br />
This is a work in progress and will remain so for its duration, I've little doubt.<br />
<br />
What I have done is simply compiled a listing of places I know of for certain level spans.  What I need you to do is reply to this post with more places, new places, and corrections to any errors I may have made.  I will fully admit its been some time since I was below level 50 and some of my memory isn't the greatest. ;)<br />
<br />
Eventually the guide will be part of the Druid's Grove site, but as the Site Guru is out of town this week, I'll post it from my personal site for the time being.<br />
<br />
Without further ado:<br />

Basically with invis and levitate, hop down the hole and kite orcs down the long hall to the town.  There is a bank in this zone as well, but you can't bind in this zone.<br />
<br />
A druid could solo or group here easily to 35 and maybe more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plane of Mischief- Much more difficult than Hate or Fear, but still huntable by a single group or less. <br />
<br />
Actually 10 times easier than Fear or Hate due to aggro issues. The amount of KOS mobs is so insignificant that you can almost say nothing is KOS. It is of course 100 times harder to get to... but the revamp is coming so they say and its supposed to be easier to get to then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoM - Fairly easy to solo in, save for the fact mobs have massive hp now (used to be exp heaven).  Root dot is your primary method of killing, but some things outside the castle can be quadded if you are good and have great gear.  Primary focus will probably be on rats in the maze and mobs outside the castle.  In either of these cases a good bind point inside the castle should allow you to gate and camp before the mobs path too you.  <br />
<br />
Sanctus seru - High hp mobs.  Generally decent soloing for root dot at entrance or up in the towers around the edge of the zone.  Quadding is a possibility in the towers but one should be an experienced kiter and have good gear.<br />
<br />
Akheva - soloing at entrance with root dot is workable.  Quadding in the entrance hallway with indoor aoe not generally feasable due to uneven terain and mob hp/resists.<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye - 55-60 decent exp quadding and using charmed wolves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple things that I might mention...<br />
<br />
 Spectres in OOT and Oasis of Marr -- These are very quaddable (especially in OOT) and give good xp from 40-47.  The Scythes also sell for decent pp at that level.<br />
<br />
 Dire Wolves in Iceclad -- Again, excellent for quadding and give nearly one blue per quad from 37-42<br />
<br />
 Recondite Bandits in Paludal Caverns -- This is the best xp for 19-24 in the game....hands down<br />
<br />
Again, great guide.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nandar Stormstrider</div><div class="date">08-13-2002, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experiences with zones..<br />
<br />
(I've never personally done this one, but I had an idea about them before.)<br />
<br />
40 - 45 - Twilight Sea. Just quad around shadows/aliens. Though shadows will require lots - and - lots of recasts of snares since thier MR is just like every other Luclin mob.. Overly powerful. You could kite the Lesser shadows at 30 - 40 if you really wanted to, though the elementals make better xp at those levels.<br />
<br />
(Now my real experiences)<br />
<br />
45-50 - Lower Guk. You can kite in here, just gotta clear alot of room for you to run around. Don't think of more than one mob, then you just develop problems. If you can get a group, all the better. (at 51 I was able to solo frenzy camp with Root Necklace (Warden Symbol of Tunare) Snare Earring (Earring of Woven Bark) and Dot arms (Elder Spiritsts Vambraces))<br />
<br />
51-52 - Scarlet Desert. Not much more satisfaction than quadding around a bunch of big headed aliens only to find out 3 of them are named. Some nice druid loot in the zone too..<br />
[Examples of Loot found in SD (All easily obtained at 50) My thanks to Allakhazam, though sorry for directly linking and stealing bandwith but I pay for it!]<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11389<br />
[Nice belt..]<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11612<br />
[Very very nice necklace]<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7785<br />
[Very nice hand slot]<br />
<br />
Other than that, Ry`Gorr Elites are decent xp and decent loot at 51.. though I find that I'm wasting my time for xp there.. Usually if I'm there it's 100% AAxp while I farm..<br />
<br />
As for AAxp zones..<br />
<br />
Tower of Frozen Shadows - 4th and 6th floors make very very nice xp floors, though the 4th requires atleast a melee partner with decent resists and a moderate dps. The 6th floor is very easy, with two named that can drop fairly nice loot.<br />
[Abraham drops the Axe/Maul of the Stoic, both nice 2h weapons and then you have Val`Sera who drops a shaman necklace and Va`Sera Skull Earring which is a upgrade to the Orc Fang if you're a hybrid or an hp addict (only 5 more hp to the 15 on orc fang though)]<br />
<br />
Eastern Wastes - Ry`Gorr Fort makes a decent place, just quad everything that moves until you pop elites and the other named (Firbrand, Oracle, Chief) then just pull those single with harmony if you haven't cleared the place or take the cheap tatic and run by thier spawn through the wall, though you'll have to deal with any elites/lego's that are up at the moment, just snare and quad those around, or if you have high HP/AC just run far away, begin casting Upheave and time it so when they just start to hit you the spell goes off for some nice damage.<br />
<br />
Lower Guk - Frenzy camp. Pull everything from Frenzy camp to Lord with a melee, makes good AAxp until 55 when most mobs are Green/LB besides the named (Bloodthirsty, Frenzied, Lord). Heck if you're lucky, that melee could be a monk and Raster could pop.. (/snicker) Yeah.. you can dream..<br />
<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks - Hopper/Tribal cave. Never tried it, have meant to just never got around to it. My monky fear kites these at 39 =)<br />
<br />
There ya have it, my little ramble. Hope this helps someone.</div></div><hr />

This zone is nice exp from probably around 45 to 51/52 (I even did my last blue bubble of 53 here) solo.  No competition for mobs, quiet, soloable epic mob in zone.  Loot does suck and tough to quad.<br />

get kei. thats the first thing. secondly, realise that what you are hunting drops no loot.<br />
you are hunting the sonic dire wolves.<br />
i singled them til 41. at 41 i started quadding em. have kei, i flew from 39/40-47 in less than 1 day /play. at 41 you get i believe 2 blue per quad =) at 46 it is 1 blue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grundular</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 04:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best place I found for levels 33-40 or so is Jaggedpine. At 33 you can start doing Griffawns which range from 33 to 36. With wolf form nothing in this zone aggroes on you except for poachers and gnolls, both of which are stationairy. Griffawns are social, so be sure you pull them off the beaten path. Just kite them next to the sides of the zone.<br />
<br />
At 35 you can start doing Willowisps. These range from 36 to 40 in level and each one drops a greater light stone plus 0 - 4 plat and the occasional gem that sells for even more plat. Stock up on the greater light stones and take them to the gypsy in north karana and do the concordance of research quest and sell the book right back to her for 8 plat. That means every willowisp gives you a guaranteed 8 plat per kill, with an average bonus of about 4 plat per kill.<br />
<br />
At level 38 I made enough money from these wisps that I could afford KEI (for 100pp) every 2.5 hours (thus increasing my killing speed) and still have 150-200 plat left over every 2.5 hours, leaving more than enough money for my level 39 spells. At 39 there are still some yellow willowisps in there for me so I will probably stay until 42 or so.<br />

An unguarded candy store for young druids in their 20's.<br />
<br />
Port to the druid's circle, cast Wolf Form and head southwest to the river and cross over to the island entrance to Cazic-Thule.  In wolf form, nearly everything leaves you alone (except those green-con marsh bears... very odd).<br />
<br />
The Tae Ew are static and provide a smooth increase in experience:<br />
<br />
 A Tae Ew Disciple  17 - 19<br />
 A Tae Ew Warder  18 - 20<br />
 A Tae Ew Probationer  20 - 22<br />
 A Tae Ew Defender  21 - 23<br />
 A Tae Ew Page  23 - 25<br />
 A Tae Ew Sentinel  24 - 26<br />
 A Tae Ew Herald  26 - 28<br />
 A Tae Ew Protector  27 - 29<br />
 A Tae Ew Justicar  29 - 31<br />
 A Tae Ew Fanatic  30 - 32<br />
 A Tae Ew Judicator  32 - 34<br />
 A Tae Ew Zealot  32 - 34 <br />
 A Tae Ew Crusader  33 - 33<br />
<br />
Just handle the healers like the Pages carefully or you'll run out of mana and will have to run.  I use Bouncer Hund (who walks by the bridge to the island regularly) to take out the tougher Tae Ew.<br />
<br />
It was great just after the big Cazic-Thule revamp -- nearly all the Tae Ew carried Fine Steel Weapons.  My druid was crawling away with all backpacks loaded with weapons.  Now about one in five of them have FS weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1-4 The freeport noob zone. That place is SO easy, you got the guards so close, some traffic for buffs if you want, and good stuff till 4. <br />
<br />
15-19 Oasis, these are it's PRIME levels. At 14 you are wanted in groups for sow and buffs. Solo, caimans crocs DW caiman and DW crocs. The DW crocs blue till like 24 or higher. Great EXP to be found in Oasis 15-19, heck, i stayed there till 21 or 22. Just use track after 20, and after 19, just nuke down. <br />
<br />
30-34 South karana is just GREAT at these levels. Solo the Gnoll spire(s) Root DoT them. Just pull with ensnare, root, Drones and immolate. When they run out, it's health will be at about 30%, either nuke if another is popped, or drones if not. Always sit while he rooted. <br />
<br />
51-54 Dreadlands, I am getting uber exp at 53, this is STILL a great place, i leveled from 36-53 here, very good. Mainly hit the blue Ragers if you can UBEREST exp, bout 1/4 a blue a rager. Dont bother with Lightblues, just med. <br />

<br />
I love the guide. I do have one question. Has anyone created a soloing guide?<br />
<br />
I am currently level 56 and am looking for the best places to solo or double up. XP seems to fly when soloing or pairing. I was wondering if anyone has made a guide for druid soloing or if they have any good suggestions for soloing at level 56. Curently I am fighting in Jaggedpine, but I could use other ideas. Loot would be nice too. It seems that they may have nerfed the giants in BW, which is where I was previously. This is another good solo place. Made 56 there.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
I'm not positive myself as I did 56-60 almost entirely grouping.<br />
<br />
One suggest is look at the guide.  If its an outdoor non dungeon zone, odds are you can solo it.<br />
<br />
Also..sorry for the lack of updates on the guide..I've been swamped..I'll try to get a full update in the next week or two.</div></div><hr />

(some fs weapons, some pp drops, spitpaw gloves that you can sell for 5 pp in Bazaar, etc..) At Level 34 I would go to Dawnshround Peaks for grouping or soloing and BBM  just to kite the dwarfs up there. ( they drop good loot and give good xp) BTW make sure you get KEI before you try to kite them if your wisdom is below 180. Worth it though since you can makealot of pp up there.</div></div><hr />
