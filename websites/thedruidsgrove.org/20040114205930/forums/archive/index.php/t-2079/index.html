<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 62, and have no specific PoP flags, so can only go to the planes that allow people by level.  My guild is very small, and is never in PoP, so when hunting in PoP I usually solo, but am not adverse to pickup groups.<br />
<br />
Where is a good spot to hunt where I have a chance for spectrals and ornate leather patterns?  Doesn't have to be a great drop rate, just as long as it's a camp where it's possible, I'm pretty patient.  And I have more time to devote to camping stuff than plat to just buy stuff =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Emelia Sunheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bastion of Thunder for Grouping (spectrals/runes/ornate/other  decent drops) -- Although it should be noted that this is Karnors version 8.0 or whatever.  Plenty of newbies, jerks, and trains here.<br />
<br />
Halls of Honor for Soloing (quad stuff, spectrals are rare but not non-existant).  The basements can be crowded at times though.  No ornate drops here except from the trials (raid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think ornate also drops from the level 66+ stuff in the south part of the zone.  Supposedly it's single groupable but you'd need a pretty tough group to handle it.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'd try to get flagged for tactics; the side quest to get into tactics insn't too bad.  I've had pretty good luck getting spectrals from there, and I've seen the occasional ornate piece from there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The PoT quest flag is no too hard as pointed out.  On 7th though it is very much bring your own group.  I've never sen leather drop there, plate boots drop off the piggie rarely, but did get 2 spectrals (and 2 points of AA) in a morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaitan22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tactics and BoT are probably best bets.  Not sure which named drop ornate in BoT, as I abandoned hunting there for tactics and EP's.  In tactics, there's several named.  First off, the stampeding piglet.. drops various loots, good for plat (one of 2 of his drops would sell for enough for ornate leather boots or helm on my server).  Then there's the Enraged War Boar.. drops one of ornate bracer patterns, I've seen silk and chain off him so far.  There's also a named wraith.. Zelrin something, drops ornate gloves if I remember right.  Specs are pretty common in Tactics.  Tactics is a bring your own group spot on my server too, but I enjoy that myself.  Oh, and once you get Command of Tunare, it's pretty easy to solo there :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">two words:<br />
<br />
no flags =)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help everybody, I'll see what I find in BoT for now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kuolon No Surname</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If BoT is anything on your server what it is like on Fennin Ro, good luck trying to find a camp.  Smid and Spad are virtually perma-camped (best places to get specs, runes, ornate, items) and most of the time there's about 100 people in there.  When there's a raid attempting to take down the Tower rares expect that number to rise from 100 to 150.<br />
<br />
HoH would probably be your best bet.  Far Left Basement seems to be where I've had the best luck with spectrals.  If you can get another DoTing class if you, you can easily clear the basement and then pull the unsnarables (the guys in the black armor).  One person can be aggro-kiting around the room applying DoTs while the other just meds and lays on the DoTs, adding in a nuke or two.  The ones in the black armor seem to have the best rate at dropping the spectrals.  Very very rarely will you see a spectral drop off of the guys in the white armor.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out a bit and good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ZanthaRC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">at 62 your chances of getting a grp in BoT are very small. There are a ton of druids on most servers so there will normally be a 65 that is LFG. I would suggest grouping/soloing/duo'ing in PoV/PoS/HoH until you get 65, then you will be able to get a group in BoT fairly easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I  am not sure it is quite that bad on 7th, although in fairness I have only been there once for exp grouping. There were maybe 40 people in zone and it seemed a lot like KC of old (although without quite as many trains....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">BoT is quite possibly the shittiest zone ever.<br />
<br />
No wait, I take that back, I forgot how much I hate ToV.</div></div><hr />
