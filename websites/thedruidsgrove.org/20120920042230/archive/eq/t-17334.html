What spells would you use for a full mob debuff? With the addition of a couple new spells I'm a bit confused as to which bebuffs to be using. <br />
I sure wish SoE would give us a &quot;Unity&quot; tpye spell including all debuffs in one! :banghead:<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :icon_lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are the 3 debuffs I cast on just about every boss mob:<br />
<br />
Hand of Ro <br />
7: Decrease Fire Resist by 72 <br />
10: Decrease ATK by 100 <br />
12: Decrease AC by 15 <br />
<br />
Skin to Flora Rk. II <br />
1: Increase Incoming Spell Damage by 9% <br />
2: Limit: Max Level(85) (lose 10% per level over cap) <br />
3: Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
4: Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
5: Limit: Resist(Fire allowed) <br />
6: Limit: Combat Skills Not Allowed <br />
7: Unknown #367 (100/25/0) <br />
<br />
Blanched Frost Rk. II <br />
5: Decrease ATK by 136 <br />
6: Decrease AC by 36 <br />
 <br />
Which gives a total debuff of:<br />
-72 Fire Resist<br />
-236 Attack<br />
-51 AC<br />
+9% damage from Fire nukes<br />
 <br />
I keep these spells in my raid lineup all the time so that I don't have to flip back and forth between spell sets, and they're the most effective ones for accomplishing my goals - I basically want to make the mob not hit as hard / often, and raise both melee and caster DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually skip the Coldwhisper Breath because the cold nuke I use (situationally) already has a resist mod.  Fixation doesn't seem to want to land as often as I would like, either, and the duration on Withering Sunray makes it kinda painful to keep on the mob.  I would probably only add those other spells to my debuffing lineup if it were my primary job for a specific encounter - i.e. if I didn't have to heal and / or wasn't expected to do any damage.<br />
 <br />
That's good info on the possible conflict with ranger abilities, though.  I wasn't aware of that.  Our dps core has more wizzies and mages and necro's, than rangers, though, so I'll have to check with the rangers and see how often this might be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">02-25-2009, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main reason I use Coldwhisper Breath is to help Blanched Frost land.  (Actually, I suppose that's a carryover from when the cold-based ATK debuffs didn't have a resist mod.)  The extra debuffs on top of that are a nice bonus, though.  You say you only use cold nukes very often--does this mean you don't use the druid Winter's Flare line and the ranger equivalent much?<br />
<br />
Usually I handle cold debuffs and another druid handles fire debuffs, though my default raiding spell set includes both, since I'm occasionally the only druid on.<br />
<br />
We're fairly ranger-heavy, but I suppose I should check on which mobs are considered humanoids.  A 9% bonus to fire is big enough that I should probably include it when it won't get in the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">02-26-2009, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually have between 1 and 3 druids at any particular guild raid these days, so splitting up the debuffing isn't always an available option.  <br />
 <br />
I don't really use Winter's Flare much on raid bosses because of the aggro component - I'm sitting at about 1020 total AA's and I haven't gotten around to all of the Spell Casting Subtlety AA's yet, so I need to be careful.  There are a number of encounters we've been doing where I know that Skin to Flora isn't an option because of the mob type (Your target does not meet spell requirements) so on those encounters I usually toss another nuke in - I might go with some of your suggestions on those instead and see what kind of results I get.</div></div><hr />

Fixation seems to not stack with Blanched Frost.  Coldwhisper Breath does help Blanched land on some events.  Rangers don't appear to use the Heartshear ability very much at all.  My overall DPS is up by mixing in the Winter's Flare line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrian</div><div class="date">03-05-2009, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hand of Ro, Fixation of Ro, Coldwhisper Breath, and Blanched Frost definately DO stack. I use all 4 every raid. However, some of raid bosses are immune or resistant to one or the other, but they will stack if they can land. My raid spell set consists of those 4 debuffs, survival group heal, normal group heal, both single target heals, twincast, and a nuke. After I get the debuffs in, I trade one out for another nuke. That lineup seems to work well enough.</div></div><hr />
