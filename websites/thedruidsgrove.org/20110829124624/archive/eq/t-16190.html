 <br />
I would highly recommend gathering as many hotzone augs as you can for the hps/mana combo and even the mana only ones until you get better.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
here is a good post for the augs etc.<br />
 <br />
If you can get anyone to help you with the relic quests (borso, relic charm etc) that would be big boost.<br />
 <br />
Also I would recommend getting the dain aug and finishing it if you haven't done so.<br />
 <br />
Augs are your main weakness ....Don Merchant augs are 50 or 55m or you can get the hps.<br />
 <br />
Between the hot zone augs and the Don Merchant you could fill in the gaps nicely.<br />
 <br />
You might look at the jewelry that is player made and it has 2 aug slots.<br />
 <br />
Another avenue is doing pirate tasks/missions for that tier gear until you can get into katta missions.<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps.<br />

 <br />
Once you can kite the mammoths in icefall or see if ivory no drop tusk are rotting then you should do the shield from valdeholm also (might need help taking out the final guy) There was post about it or look on alla's or lucy for battered shield....also do the brraaiinnss MM for the ac 20 30hps to put on your shield.</div></div><hr />
