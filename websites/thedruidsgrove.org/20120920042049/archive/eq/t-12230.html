 <br />
1.  It lasts for 1 minute and it has a reuse of 36 minutes.<br />
 <br />
2.  At rank 5 while active it reduces agro 100%.<br />
 <br />
3.  This would mean, theoretically at least, a warrior could shoot an arrow at a named to get agro, i could pop silent casting lvl 5 and nuke to my hearts content without stealing agro from the warrior, even tho he has only shot an arrow at it?<br />
 <br />
Am I way off base here?  Any info would be appreciated.<br />

It is not 100% reduction like you think, but it is a huge reduction.  I think it may be something like 0-100% reduction in aggro per spell cast while it's on, similar to heal focus items or nuke focuses.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was just improved SCS with the ability to turn it on and off as needed for aggro kiting.<br />
<br />
Since it is 1 minute every 36, I've just added it to my list of &quot;AAs to buy when I have bought every other AA ability and can't bank any more&quot;.<br />
<br />
This seems to be totally useless.</div></div><hr />

It's a fairly situational tool but one that can be incredibly useful.</div></div><hr />

Upon engage of a big mob you can safely heal your tank while he is still trying to gain agro. Finally, healers are not the first to be eaten for dinner =) Ill get this as soon as i get back to grinding.</div></div><hr />

Especially in Dreadspire that pulls come in 2-3-4 mobs and you dont have a mez class... Hit silent casting, heal and no agro :P<br />
<br />
I got it asap</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aegyen</div><div class="date">09-29-2005, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what is cast time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">09-30-2005, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe 3 seconds.  But in being unable to heal for 3 seconds usually means tank splat in the kinds of situations I'm talking about using it for.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Casting time is 2.5. Recast time on our heals is 2.25 seconds. Delaying heals 0.3 seconds is worth it for the benefit of the aa's in situations that call for it -- you just need to learn how to get it off fast between spell casts. Personaly, I have it on slot 5 hot button page 9 -- so as I cast a spell I'll hit shift+9, than when it's down casting I hit 5, than while SC is casting I put my mouse over my heal's spell gem, than while I cast a manual heal I hit shift+1 to get back to main page. Very little time lost if your quick about it.<br />
 <br />
Anyways, most practical purposes for SC the casting time doesn't matter much. If you see a lot of mobs come into camp, if you cast heals right off the bat you'll most likely die anyways, so that window of time is when you want to cast SC so you can blast heals left and right w/o having to worry about mobs being locked down.</div></div><hr />

For some reason the tanks in my guild are slack and lazy, so going full burn on just about any named mob will guarantee i go splat with at least half my mana left.. Raids i've used this on so far i can pretty much guarantee being able to dump almost my entire manapool on dmg without coming close to being summoned.</div></div><hr />
