<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">01-18-2007, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering what everyones thoughts are on BC after the first couple days. After installing I took the druid to Outlands to start the grind, But lag and overcrowded areas made me park him and begin my BE pallies journey. I think what I might do is wait a week or so for people to clear out of the first quest areas.<br />
<br />
 I thought the BE starting area was very cool. There were alot of people ofcourse but not really any lag (Bloodhoof Server, have a couple freinds there). General chat was a bit annoying with person after person asking where to find this and that but i kept on plugging away. Amazing how I kept leveling and finishing quest after quest just by reading the quest log  :P. Plus i didnt want to ask any question because I noticed that if someone did they would be accused of being Alliance rerollers  LOL.<br />
 My Pally is now lvl 20 (woot SoC) and parked in the Ghostlands which is a very cool zone. There are ALOT of quests to do in this zone which will get you from lvl 10-20 easily. Also like the fact that you can get noob gear with some stats as your rep goes up with the town there. Also once i got to this zone the crowd of people really died down. Im sure alot of people will make BE's but never make it out of the noob grounds.<br />
 Although the BE male seems to be a little....uh...ya...I like him, and so far the Mana Tap and Torrent racial skills seem very very nice.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to take my time and enjoy the game, rather than grind as fast as I can to 70.  That being said, I did ding 61 last night (err, this morning) and was pretty happy to put that point in to get OoC.<br />
<br />
I particularly enjoy the quests where you drop the bombs on stuff.  And, I'm making money uber-fast, which is good because I need my epic riding skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">01-18-2007, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Outlands is unplayable for me. Constant world server crashes, server restarts and the ever-present lag gives me no desire to even log my druid in there. So I started a BE rogue on a pvp server, having a lot of fun. Recaptured a bit of that feeling I had when wow first released and everything was new. Lotta fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">01-18-2007, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Started a BE Warlock myself.  Got him to 16, parked in Ghostlands also.  I have been really excited about it the last couple days up until now.  Today I have been scanning the forums reading about how BE just don't make as good of a warlock as undead do.  So now I'm getting cold feet. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-18-2007, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely love Outlands. I got my druid there as soon as I could get it installed, and I've been questing ever since... Yeah, a lot of people don't read the log. It's annoying to see the EXACT SAME QUESTION asked twice within a span of FIFTEEN SECONDS. No one reads the quest log, ugh.<br />
<br />
It is like finding a whole new world, and I am having a blast leveling. For the most part, I enjoy going as fast as I can, but I still do my best to follow the story going on and enjoy the new content.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty lucky in that my server didn't encounter any lag until last night. It lasted about half an hour, before they shut down the realm for about ten minutes, and it was back up--no problem. I dinged 62 last night, and I'm halfway to 63 already. Leveling is such a breeze as a full feral.<br />
<br />
I have to say, you'll love maim! (assuming most of you weren't on beta? o.o). I tested it out on a pally in my guild, and out of two attempts I kept him stunlocked. The damage I was putting out killed him before he could do anything. The one time he managed to get a chance to cast a stun, I resisted it. Primal Tenacity (I think?) anyone?<br />
<br />
Looking forward for the rest of BC. I already saw the tier 4 and 5 sets in Shattrath (spelling?) in Terrokar. They look pretty cool, and I can't wait to get them. Hope to hear you are all having fun!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I get some lag near Honor Hold, but I was able to do a bunch of those quests already ( hit 62 last night ) and have run Ramparts and Blood Furnace a few times each.  I have explored a few areas already, but need to go back and start doing quests here soon.<br />
<br />
And yes maim is the awesome.  I can't wait to stun lock some unexpecting foe =D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">01-18-2007, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm loving BC myself. Since I was always used to tanking in groups/raids before it, my DPS gear had almost never gotten used. Now it's being used a fair bit. <br />
<br />
I didn't even start doing stuff in Hellfire Penninsula until lvl 61 though, at which time I only was in there for about 6 hours though.<br />
<br />
Me? I went immediately to Zangarmarsh, got the FP from HH, and didn't even talk to any of the npcs in there until I got to Zangarmarsh, and more specifically, the Cenarion Expidition Camp. Why? http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29171<br />
<br />
It's also nice because Zangarmarsh is a little harder then Hellfire Penninsula, and I can't stand doing things that aren't at least a little bit of a challenge, and besides the fact that it's harder (Amongst other things) it's also nice because not many people in comparsion to those at Hellfire Penn have came to Zangarmarsh yet, so there isn't any lag in that zone whilst there is a ton in hellfire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
kmpirish, you're right. Gold is ezmode now. I had 24g and bought Master Herbalism and Alchemy (Both 10g each) but with about 4 greens and some unused quest rewards (about 3) I gained about 2-3g a piece! It's amazing.</div></div><hr />

I think blizz really did a great job in designing the quests and cities.  I love Shattrath for some strange reason, I just think they did an excellent job portraying an exotic looking refuge city out in the middle of nowhere. I could spend hours there.  xD   So yeah, so far I am impressed.  <br />
<br />
I hit 62 last night, maim w00t :D  I'm not really trying to level super-fast, just having fun questing and exploring, getting gear upgrades (finally at 1300 ap lol, never did get a very good dps set).<br />
<br />
I keep meaning to make a few new chars to see the starting areas etc., but I'm too hooked on leveling the dr00d, lol.  &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">01-19-2007, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BC is the BOMB! As a relatively new 60 who hasn't been able to invest the hours and hours it takes to raid and get tiered gear in Azeroth, I find I can go to Hellfire Peninsula, do some of the easy, fun quests there, and be adequately geared to go to the first instance without embarrassing myself. After MTing Ramparts three times and OTing once, I've learned the tricks to this enjoyable instance and picked up some awesome gear (but not the staff */cry*). I suspect that by the time I've run Blood Furnace I'll be better equipped than if I had spent weeks or months running ZG, MC and AQ.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate what Blizzard has done (so far) in BC. I love the short, small instances because, frankly, it's just too burdensome for those of us with jobs, wives, children, houses, cars, pets, parents and various other family members and responsibilities to come up with the numerous extended hours it takes to do the big raids with 19-39 other people. I think Blizzard is appropriately responding to the concerns (and loss of subsctriptions) of people like me who love to play but have a life outside of WoW too. Good job Blizz!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">01-22-2007, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absolutely love TBC... My druid is 65 now, soon to be 66... Maim is incredible for both grinding and PVP.. So fun to see a rogue and just stunlock him to death...<br />
<br />
The amount of DPS that are possible to do is insane...<br />
Buffed in a 5-man I have about 2.2K attackpower and 27% crit chance...<br />
<br />
Did a new shred record last night, 2.4K !!!! Didnt know that was possible... And my FB crit regularely for 3K ++<br />
<br />
Just try out when the lag is low... Pounce - FF - Mangle - Shred - Maim... Then do a Shred + Mangle again... mob dead.. very nice for grinding... And if you get a OOC proc + crit on that , well yeah ;)<br />
<br />
Druids are extremely good in TBC, and absolutely loving it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-22-2007, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hear ya Brekster... So much damage now. Mobs are easier than before, and the crits are insane. I know me and another druid in my guild (there's only like three druids) are seriously considering seeing if we can stay full feral, but still heal and off-tank or -DPS when it's needed.<br />
<br />
I have to get used to doing so much damage. &gt;_&lt; I kept pulling aggro off the tank in Caverns of Time (Which is an AWESOME instance, by the way--if you're a lore addict, at least. It's unusual, and doesn't feel like one, but it's great. I can't wait to do Black Morass and Hyjal.).<br />
<br />
Seriously, druids rock in BC. The only part I dislike is that all aspects got much needed skills (Maim, Cat; Lacerate, Bear; Lifebloom, Resto), except Balance. Balance got no new spells. I mean, I'm not balance myself, but I can't help but feel sorry for balance druids because they didn't get another cool spell to kick around.<br />
<br />
I saw a druid in flight form last night, it was so cool. I can't wait to get it... Today or tomorrow, definately. *drool*<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yes, if you all didn't know. As soon as you hit 65, go to Nagrand (By far my favorite zone), go to the Laughing Skull Ruins, and go to the Ring of Blood. Do that, and enjoy your Staff of Beasts. Takes a group of 5, though.</div></div><hr />
