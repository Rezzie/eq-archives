<br />
Non-raiding level 70 druid here. I missed getting any spells with GoD but have since gone on to get all my OoW spells including 69s and 70s (not the ancient).<br />
<br />
We seem to have a very gung-ho researcher on our server so the GoD spells are now pretty much all available for purchase in the bazaar. And I have some cash to afford them. My question is are they worth purchasing?<br />
<br />
From what I could find in previous threads, it seems that SI might be more mana efficient with the right combo of gear. I'm not that well equipped, having just the basic level 5 focuses for IH, MP, etc.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any thoughts for other classes GoD spells, I'd love to hear your thoughts on those as well as I do have alts:)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
That said..<br />
<br />
I would pick up SI.<br />
<br />
Embers is replaced by Sun, so no real reason to get it.<br />
<br />
Fire is repalced with Strike.  Since Strike is the 3rd 69 Rune, buying Fire would  be a good move if you didn't have Strike, or didn't expect to get it soon.<br />

Heals are to low as is &gt;&lt;.  Have to heal some tanks 3-4 times w/ .4.5-6k heals to get em to 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup.<br />
<br />
Get SI. It's a very very nice heal especially if you suffer in the mana department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">03-07-2006, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never managed to get SI.  Wouldn't use it if I did.<br />
<br />
I use only one heal now, Ancient: Chlorobon.<br />
<br />
Now, of course, I understand that most people don't have that spell.  And not everyone has 10k mana.<br />
<br />
But even when I didn't have the spell and had less mana, I just used NI and then Chlorotrope.<br />
<br />
When I needed a big heal, which was most of the time, I used Chlorotrope.  When I just needed to top off someone, I used NI.<br />
<br />
Considering the effort it takes to get SI (and the fact that if you take the rune for it, someone else can't get their class spell, which might actually be very useful to them), I can't see many people getting it.  And I don't see why they would want to spend that kind of effort to get it.<br />
<br />
I guess it is just me, I don't understand how it is really useful even though I read what people said and tried.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Ah, I just actually read the first post here and see you can now research it.  I like having a full spellbook but don't see me using it.  Sure, if you like to be very exact with the proper spell to heal just the right amount for the least mana, go for it.  I never wanted to use up that many spell gems and concentration to figure out which one to use.<br />
<br />
As for other classes, when my guild raided GoD, several other classes mentioned that the spell they would get for the rune was very important to them, so of course I passed on it to them.  I don't remember what spells exactly they got, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuppet</div><div class="date">03-08-2006, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you don't NEED SI - if you are satisfied with your healing performance currently, then there's no need to purchase SI (I'm assuming that the spell is currently in the 20-30K range).  it's just a bonus or a perk since it's an upgraded version of NI.<br />
<br />
I would recommend SI more highly if you often found yourself in situations where more healing was necessary, i.e. raiding or higher-end content.  I used Chlorotrope for big heals or hp/sec, then SI for any patch heals or when Chlorotrope was overkill (I used NI before I got SI).<br />
<br />
keep an eye out if the price ever drops or perhaps work out a deal with the researcher (by providing farmed components).</div></div><hr />
