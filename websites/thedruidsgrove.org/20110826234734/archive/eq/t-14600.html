<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rugrin</div><div class="date">10-13-2006, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Howdy All,<br />
 <br />
I'm at work and was checking out my gear on EQ Characters and started thinking that in a few more levels, many of my focus items are going to wear out their usefullness.<br />
 <br />
I don't have a Magelo's account so I can't link these things but I'll give a brief rundown:<br />
 <br />
Rotting Murkglider Drape-Mana Pres. III-Will last till 60<br />
Grey Flesh Gloves-Affliction Efficiency II<br />
Kobold Hide Boots-Buring Affliction II<br />
Moonstone Ring-Extended Range II<br />
 <br />
And also at level 45 (iirc) Ill be able to trade out my Acrylia Sleeves for Elder Spiritist's Vambraces-Clicky Drones of Doom.<br />
 <br />
I also have a shield (forget name) that has Mana Pres. III that I could replace the Drape with if there is a better cloak type item I should be wearing.<br />
 <br />
My questions are:<br />
 <br />
1) Are these the types of focus effects that I should invest in going up to the next rank in?<br />
2) Any suggestions for something else to work on?<br />
3) Is it worth giving up the AC and Stat+ for the clicky Drones?  How long will this be effective before I should upgrade the sleeves?<br />
 <br />
I know there is much more out there but I mostly solo (not by choice) and purchase in bazaar. <br />
 <br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />

I highly recommend picking up a pair.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rugrin</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks so much for the response...just a little update since last post:<br />
 <br />
At last post I had the following:<br />
 <br />
Gray Flesh Gloves: Spell Haste II (losing its usefullness)<br />
Kobold-hide Boots: Burning Affliction II (same)<br />
Moonstone Ring: Estended Range II (and again)<br />
Rotting Murkglider Drape: Mana Pres III (good for a while)<br />
 <br />
I was able to pick up a few beauties since the last post:<br />
 <br />
Dromrek Bracelet: Spell Haste IV (will last a while)<br />
Grotesque Veil: Improved Damage III (good for a bit)<br />
Golem Essence Necklace: Improved Healing III (my favorite since I got this myself in CoM)<br />
 <br />
And I also have Shield of the Mist: Mana Pres III which could be traded out if I can find a better cloak.<br />
 <br />
Any suggestions on how to upgrade the level II items and or something I'm missing that I definantly should have would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
