 <br />
 First Things First! - Getting there!<br />
 <br />
The main access point is the Mines in Steamfont Mountins. This will allow you to access either Dragonscale Hills or Loping Plains. Druids will gain porting power to the Loping Plains, and thus closer to Bloodmoon Keep, while Wizards gain access to Dragonscale Hills, and thus Crystallos.<br />
 <br />
 The Portal spells contain a Ring, Circle and Zephyr to the Loping Plains and can be obtained from Leneanon Cloudsong at the Dring Ring in Loping Plains loc:2556, 1459. They each cost 53 plat (at time of writing) with 358 CHA. The spells are level 75.<br />
 <br />
 So, now I am in SoF - where do I go?<br />
 <br />
 SoF is broken down into tiers, with 2 locked zones.<br />
 <br />
The tuning Point for Tier 1 is Level 75 and is about the difficulty of Atiiki in The Buried Sea. The areas which fall into Tier 1 are:<br />
 <br />
 * Dragonscale Hills and its instances<br />
 * Loping Plains<br />
 <br />
Now, if your a hard core grouper, or sporting Anguish+ armor, you can likely move directly into Tier 2, which is a step up. This tier is designed for level 80 players wearing full Praetorian Gear, or have a nearly full outfit from the Tier 1 Areas. Zones for here include:<br />
 <br />
 * The Mechamatic Guardian<br />
 * Bloodmoon Keep<br />
 * Hills of Shade and the Crypt of Shade<br />
 * Fortress Mechanotus<br />
 * Gryospires Beta and Zeka<br />
 <br />
 Brief explanation of where these are:<br />
 <br />
 The Mechamatic Guardian is the huge robot that roams Dragonscale Hills.<br />
 Bloodmoon Keep is the large Wereorc fortress in Loping Plains<br />
 Hill of Shade (and thus Crypt of Shade) are off Loping Plains<br />
 Fortress Mechanotus is off Dragonscale Hills (go go Catapult)<br />
 The Gryospires are off Fortress Mechanotus.<br />
 <br />
Tier 3, likewise - goes even further and is tuned for Level 80 Players wearing mostly Tier 2 armor (about TSS raid level). Tier 3 zones are:<br />
 <br />
 * The Steam Factory<br />
 * S.H.I.P. Workshop<br />
 * Meldrath's Majestic Mansion<br />
 <br />
 The Mansion is the first locked zone in the expansion.<br />
 <br />
I want to take a second to point out the gear requirements and aa requirements are pretty real. Zones can have as low as 12 minute respawn times in some areas and several mobs have neat tricks they like to use when fighting. <br />
 <br />
 Tier 4 is Crystallos - which is also locked by a groupable access quest.<br />
 <br />
A note on Crystallos, it's tuned for level 80 players decked out in Tier 3 Armor and are sporting closer to the 1k AA mark. The access quest is fairly long, but was tuned by several group configurations, and ideally the issues seen with the Solteris Arc won't play out here a second time.<br />
 <br />
 Items:<br />
 <br />
 I'm not going to give you a stat by stat listing of the items - what fun would that be? Instead we're going to cover some basic things.<br />
 <br />
 First, Tier 2 Focii effects have gone up from the normal 30% we're used to seeing on groupable armor, to 35% This continues to increase to the 45% focii you see on Tier 4 groupable armor. Raid armor can go to 70% focus.<br />
 <br />
Secondly, the armor design is set to be consistent as you level and upgrade slots. This means that it follows the Katta focus layout for the most part.<br />
 <br />
 Gloves - Cold Focus<br />
 Arms - Fire Focus<br />
 Helm - Magic Focus<br />
 Legs - Detri Haste<br />
 Boots - Beni Haste<br />
 Chest - Likely heal focus - unsure.<br />
 <br />
New Mod 2's. There have been several new mod 2s added. Items are not typically lacking in Mod 2s. These include, but are not limited to - +Healing, +Spell Damage, and so forth.<br />
 <br />
 Tier 4 Armor has 5 Armor sets. Water, Earth, Fire, Air and Prismatic. The focii are the same on all sets. The other stats and mod 2s alter depending on which item you select. <br />
 <br />
 Now I am sure the question is - where do I get this armor.  Answer is, I don't know.  So go out and search and report back!<br />
 <br />
 Note: Our Epic effect will degrade at 5% per level, like all other Focii effects. This increases the lifespan of the Click by a few years, but the item will eventually be obsoleted by newer items. As the epic is going on over 3 years old, they are OK with phasing them out.<br />
 <br />
 Spells:<br />
 <br />
This is a listing of the Spells we get. There are 5 Spell Vendors in SoF. Not all these spells will be on those vendors. About 25% of the spells from every class are obtained via Quests, Faction based merchants and so forth. Spells not on vendor will be denoted with a *.<br />

 Mana regen issues addressed:<br />
 <br />
Mask of the Shadowcat was created as if we had gotten a TSS upgrade. The new mana regen values for Shadowcat are 8, 10 and 11. This results in a minimum increase of 3 mana regen over Mask of the Wild. Ironwood Skin's mana regen was increased by 1 per rank over Direwild. This results in 11,12,13 for mana regen values based on rank.<br />
 <br />
 Net result was a minimum of 4 mana regen base, with 7 for rank 2 spells which should be available to most people. Raiders will see a 9 MR increase with Rank 3.<br />
 <br />
 Debuff Issues addressed:<br />
 <br />
 There was an issue confirmed by the Dev team where our debuffs would basically provide no benifit to group content with a raid geared tank. We knew this already, but confirmation is nice. Raids, where not typically an issue since they are tuned differently then random zone trash.<br />
 <br />
 In SoF they took steps to restore the value of AC, and by extension, our attack debuff line, so we should no longer see that issue on group content, regardless of if the tank raids or is casual. In addition, the changes they made allow our debuffs to have the possibility of being more effective then we've been able to parse in the past.<br />
 <br />
 We inquired about combined debuffs, but they want more time to evaluate that request.  <br />
 <br />
 New Spell Information:<br />
 <br />
 Survival of the Fittest:<br />
 <br />
This spell is a new spell given to Druids at level 78. Shaman get an equivalent spell called Ancestral Intervention both spells function in the same manner, and I am going to try to cover everything here.<br />
 <br />
 Design concept:<br />
 <br />
During beta it became apparent that the gap between Clerics and the other two priests in terms of Emergency heals was to large. These spells are an attempt to lower the gap by giving us a multiple person (group) healing tool for use in situations similar to that a Cleric may click their Epic Shield or use Divine Arb in. Because of this, certain limitations were implemented to the spell to prevent it from replacing our normal group heal lines.<br />
 <br />
 How it works:<br />
 <br />
 The spell is a group emergency tool. I don't use the word heal, because the spell has no base heal value (don't panic, I will explain). How the spell works is there a preset heal value for different health levels (determined by rank), the spell heals you for the correct value as determined by the health triggers.<br />
 Simply - the spell heals those hurt more - for more. This makes the spell stronger in certain cases then Divine Arb due to the fact it restores lost hitpoints, rather then simply shifting them around between the group members.<br />
 <br />
 Now, how the health triggers work:<br />
 <br />
The spell will not heal anyone over 65% health - this is by design and to prevent the tool from developing uses other then the intended one.<br />
 <br />
 So, using rank 1 values:<br />
 <br />
 Between 55 and 65% = 1285<br />
 Between 45 and 55% = 2570<br />
 Between 35 and 45% = 3854<br />
 Between 25 and 35% = 5139<br />
 Below 25% = 6424<br />
 <br />
 Each of these can be modified by Focii and AA per cast.<br />
 <br />
Now, as may be expected this is cause for concern about healing aggro. I had a developer check with server side scripting and the spell does not increase aggro upon application. <br />
 <br />
 Rank 1 Values:<br />
 <br />
 Cast time: 1 Second<br />
 Recast time: 3 Minutes<br />
 Range: 200<br />
 Mana Cost: 1225 (Focusable by SCM, Mana Pres, etc)<br />
 Healing amount: see above.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 AA improvements:<br />
 <br />
The second cause for concern amongst raiders would likely be the cast time and recast time. Both of these issues can be addressed if a player chooses via the AA system.<br />
 <br />
 Nodyin created an AA line for both Druid and Shaman similar to that of Unfailing Divinity for Divine Intervention. The AA line (Fortified Survival) increases the power of this one spell (all ranks) and has 3 ranks of 3 AA each. <br />
 <br />
 Rank 1 Drops the Cast time to .9 seconds and 2.5 minutes recast <br />
 Rank 2 Drops the Cast time to .7 seconds and 2.0 minutes recast<br />
 Rank 3 Drops the Cast time to .5 seconds and 1.5 minutes for recast timer.<br />
 <br />
 Reaping Inferno:<br />
 <br />
This spell may only be cast on mobs &lt;20% health. If it kills the mob it grants a Buff to the caster which increases critical chance and damage for the duration. This killshot proc will only fire on mobs which grant exp.<br />
 <br />
 See Invis (2):<br />
 <br />
 Sharp Eyes will allow you to see an upgraded form of invis NPCs will be using. Normal See Invis and Mask line spells will be unable to detect these mobs.<br />
 <br />
 Preincarnation:<br />
 <br />
 This spell has a second chance to fire Touch of the Divine if it fails the first check. The second attempt has a 10% success fire rate.<br />
 <br />
 Scales of the Reptile:<br />
 <br />
 Now counts the number of procs, instead of the number of swings.<br />
 <br />
 The reason for the change is as follows:<br />
 <br />
 The spells were actually always meant to work that way, but due to a bug in the code, they didn&#8217;t. So, we had to approximate the number of procs before it wore off based on proc rate and number of swings. It&#8217;s unfortunately not very accurate and has caused some serious balance problems. The fix to actually count down on procs allows the spells to be much more balanced since we can tune them around X number of actual procs instead of an approximation. <br />
 <br />
 This change is retroactive: The level 68 DoD spell Skin of the Reptile now functions under the same system. Both Skin and Scales have a max proc counter of 12. This gives Skin a max heal value of 7,200 and Scales a max heal value of 8,784.<br />
 <br />
 Since I am sure you are curious - the Paladin versions of these spells now also have a 30 second recast.<br />
 <br />
 Lunarlight: I've sent e-mails to Prathun, Rashere and Nodyin on the topic and I have yet to get any reply. As for the upgrade Crescentbloom, I've spoken with Rashere and if the spell is found lacking, there are strong chances it will be upgraded. Now, for this to happen I need more then just - this spell sucks. I need very specfic examples of content (as in where you were and what you were fighting) to pass to the dev team to support our claims.<br />

 FYI Note - Clockworks are considered Constructs, and thus can be hit with  Annihilate the Unnatural.<br />

 <br />
 Evoke, Conjur, Alter, Divine, and Abjur each where increased to 330.<br />
 <br />
 The skill Meditate was increased drastically.<br />

 <br />
How cute of you. I'll tell you &quot;what fun that would be.&quot; It would address the single largest concern most of the playerbase has about this expansion - the fact that groupable armor achievable from some point in this expansion is going to be superior to the best TSS raid armor, when a majority of the raiding guilds on each server are still doing DP or DK content, or just now breaking into TSS.<br />
 <br />
So since you won't be specific, could you at least tell us at which content level the 500 hp/mana groupable armors with 45% healing and damage foci are going to be obtained. I had been led to believe from developer chats that there were only 3 levels of group armor, with the third being the 500/500 stuff. In your writeup you referr to this armor as &quot;Tier 4 groupable armor.&quot; Does this mean that there are 4 and not 3 levels of armor, or merely that the third level of quested armor is going to come from Crystallos. Or is it that the tier 3 armors have the 500/500 hp and mana but lack the foci and mods you mention?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 1 isn't an armor set.<br />
Tier 2 likely comes from Quests in Tier 2 Areas (see top of post)<br />
Tier 3 Armor likely comes from zones which fall into Tier 3.<br />
Tier 4 Armor almost assuredly has to do with Crystallos.<br />
<br />
I am perfectly aware it obsoletes older content.  That isn't something directly under my control.  Crystallos however was designed for people in Tier 3 Armor (about TSS raid level), so there needs to be a path for people to reach that armor level during the year long cycle.<br />

<br />
Please and thanks!<br />
<br />
Storm Strike: 200 Range DD, .5 Cast, 30 Second Recast, MR Check. Can Critical and be focused by Destructive Fury. All Ranks are set to level 76. Damage varies by mob health percentage. Mobs over 75 % will also take an additional amount of damage listed in the brackets, as a second attack.<br />

seems to be a step in the right direction of better dps. the main concern as i see it was the constant annoying spell swapping that was going on by almost everyone, and i am very happy this is adressed by a low resist Entrap upgrade (maybe i can finally get rid of mire thorns?) and the extra spell gem! constant spell swapping was always my main gripe from the beginning, i feel druids and shammies get hit on this much harder than any other class, and im happy to see that we seem to have a life of reduced spell swapping ahead of us yay!:dance:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nduma</div><div class="date">11-12-2007, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No added buff slots for simply gaining levels (and not sure if I remember TSS doing that either).<br />
<br />
As for the 10th gem slot, it is nice but, also it doesn't do us much good.<br />
<br />
This expansion introduced at least 3 new situational spells for druids - the Emergency Heal (SotF), Solarsilver and Reaping Inferno. On the plus side though since snare and Direwood got turned into AA - if you used those 2 spells, you will open up some spell gems.<br />
<br />
Then you read what Fenier has to say about attack.<br />
<br />
I know most druids that I play along side usually just use IB or Vines in groups for attack debuffs, HoR, Hoar's Frost and Fixation of Ro aren't usually used. Mobs die to fast and they are wasteful to be used. However, supposedly in SoF they will become meaningful. Assuming that they are once again becoming useful - then most druids will have to load up HoR and Hoar's Frost in groups.<br />
<br />
A lot of us other druids in beta pushed for a long time for druid's to get a combined debuff of some sort via AA or spells. In the end though we didn't get it and right now the lip service is it will be considered after launch. My personal experience from seeing how Lunarlight was said it will be looked at after launch and still after a 3 month beta not being looked at doesn't leave much hope there.<br />
<br />
Still going back to our spell line up.<br />
<br />
Reptile got severely nerfed purely to stop it from being &quot;exploited&quot; in old content. The shaman equilavent lasts longer, has a shorter recast, slows, has no proc limiter and costs half the mana - yet ours was too exploitable.<br />
<br />
Solarsilver - in my experience, I could use other spells in beta to far greater efficiency than using Solarsilver. It is great if you want that for show crit once in a while but, other than that serves no purpose. What is more it is extremely long casting - 7.0 seconds. Even longer than our big fire DD.<br />
<br />
Reaping Inferno - limitation is mob must be below 20% to use it. Then if you beat out a melee to get the kill shot, you stand a mediocre chance to proc a buff that lasts only 24 seconds. That means you have to have a mob in camp, fully debuffed and you have no other job in the group other than to nuke - the mob has to also have agro locked  - then you can cast your 6 to 7 second direct damage nukes to get the benefit of the proc. Again, for a druid that has only 10 gem slots, I was not able to work this spell into my line up in some basic groups where I was playing main healer or back up healer.<br />
<br />
From SoF - my spell line up is as follows<br />
<br />
Gem 01 - I can load one nuke - what will it be ? Winter's Blaze or Equinox Burn.<br />
Gem 02 - Reptile Skin - this may go away now with the nerf and be replaced with Fernspike<br />
Gem 03 - Moonshadow (more effecient than Lunarlight still with old focii - and new heal doesn't heal enough so you have to waste mana topping people off) and Survival of the Fittest isn't a group heal - its is an emergency heal.<br />
Gem 04 - Gelid Frost (New Hoar's Frost)<br />
Gem 05 - Hand of Ro<br />
Gem 06 - Direwood Guard till I can spend AA to replace spell version (more important AA though IMO before that happens) <br />
Gem 07 - Fast Direct Heal - I used Ancient Choloroborn but, once I get Master of the Past done - may switch to pure life. The new heal without the higher end focii is wasteful.<br />
Gem 08 - Fixation of Ro or Dispell<br />
Gem 09 - Adrenaline Swell (Super fast heal of 1.8 seconds) - again long recast - can't mem/unmem it at will to use.<br />
Gem 10 - New Survival of the Fittest (It is always mem'd because of the long recast - when you mem the spell it isn't available right away) - it goes in this spell gem slot for all my saved spell slots so if I change slots, I dont' get screwed by unmemming it by mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spells that I haven't been able to load if I use that line up<br />
<br />
Torrential Rain<br />
Chill Vapor Breath (new Icefall Breath)<br />
Skin to Mulch (New skin to vines)<br />
Solarsilver<br />
Reaping Inferno<br />
Winter's Blaze or Equinox Brand (depending which one I didn't load in Gem 01)<br />
Hoard of Fireants (magic dot)<br />
Nature's Blazing Wrath (my GoRM spell)<br />
Gelid Frost (cold DD)<br />
<br />
So what are the options here.<br />
1) Take out a couple debuffs ?<br />
2) Take out Adrenaline Surge - so your fastest single heal is lost ?<br />
3) AA like mad, so I can free up direwood guard spell gem<br />
<br />
The 10th gem is nice but, unfortunately the devs just didn't hear us regarding how they continue to make too many situational type spells for druids that we just dont have enough spell gems to make them work.<br />
<br />
For instance - we've been told that Nature's Blazing Wrath is our GoRM spell - that means to have it in the line up that means we need another spell that is our DPS spell till we get a GoRM to fire.<br />
<br />
SotF - it is emergency heal so we have to load up Moonshadow etc to be able to heal the group at once.<br />
<br />
Adrenaline Swell - it is inefficient fast heal to be used in emergencies - so have to load up a direct heal that is a bit slower but, more effecient.<br />
<br />
I'll just leave with the following:<br />
<br />
Players were told to use the spells within the content that it was intended. A lot of druids did exactly that but, in the end our tuning was done sans that information. It was done using some spreadsheet. A number of them should be thanked for whatever we did get and putting up with what I would deem as the most frustrating beta I've been a part of.<br />
<br />
Our spells are terrible IMO, some of the ideas are nice but, in practice they didn't work at all.<br />
<br />
I bought expansion for both my accounts so I am not one of those that is saying screw SOE but, also the picture isn't very good for druids, from my experience.<br />
<br />
On the AA side: I'll cite one of my biggest pet peeves - the Call of the Wild AA line to reduce reuse and cast time.<br />
<br />
Clerics got a super fast 96% AA rez, 3 second cast base with 12 second reuse. Druids on the other have to pay with AA to reduce our non-exp giving rez to a 3 second cast time and also pay additional AA to reduce the reuse to 6 minutes (this may have changed in the last month)<br />
<br />
A druid in a group that wipes and is the only rezzers still has to wait eons to rez the whole group back in, completely unbalanced IMO even though Nodyin doesn't agree.<br />
<br />
Also since day 1 of beta Nodyin said he'd look SoTW looked at so that we don't have to not use it where DS would cause bad things. But, in the end nothing happened with it. So we are still stuck with it not being usable in select content unlike other group HoT AA.</div></div><hr />

I was just told (like 5 seconds ago) that there is a chance they are going to review the defensive proc buffs for balancing reasons once SoF is launched and stable on the servers.<br />
<br />

<br />
 <br />
at the risk of being quoted a thousand times and flamed..i think every single spell in the game is situational. <br />
 <br />
Do you solo? then all those heals arent really needed. <br />
 <br />
Group? if you have a role as a healer then by locking in so many dps spells you run the risk of being in the middle of a cast when somone drew agro and badly needs a heal. and if you are mostly a dps position in the grp, again all those heals shouldnt be needed.<br />
 <br />
Most groups have a main healer and a back-up healer, and if you are one or the other then you are better off letting the rest of the grp act as dps and dont lock yourself into a casting mode. what good is a 1.8 second heal if u gotta duck to cancle casting a spell and wait for a 2 second gem refresh? after all...mobs usually die pretty fast in a full group so, with 10 spell gems and new aa's we should be able to pick a theme as for our spells: &quot;im dps so ill go dps and maybe have a fast heal in mem in case its needed and maybe purelife for the cooldown on the fastheal&quot;, or &quot;im main or back-up healer so i better keep myself free to heal if im needed&quot;<br />
 <br />
thats not to say just sit in a grp as a backup healer and do nothing : mem 2 or 3 of the gems and various debuff or damages and use them sparingly</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I have to say overall I'm pretty happy since there's quite a few things I'm looking forwards to getting: AA nuke, AA guard, AA lure snare (assuming duration is the same)...<br />
 <br />
New heal spell looks like a &quot;must have&quot; on raids.  Going to be fun scaring the rest of the group by healing them at the last minute ;).  On the other hand 10th spell slot is now gone already.  I'd still like to see serious debuff consolidation so I can load more dps spells.<br />
 <br />
I can't see myself ever loading Reaping Inferno, just too much hard work to bother with to get any benefit out of it.<br />
 <br />
I'm glad to see Call of the Wild recast reduced (down to what? 2 mins?) but unless it's essentially instant recast it's still too long.  Exactly what benefit do the devs think there is behind a group sitting around and doing nothing waiting for the druids rezz timer to repop??  Call of the Wild cast timer reduction is a big /yawn for me and will be among the last AA I'll get (if ever), or is SoF raid content designed to be battlerezz-fests?<br />
 <br />
Not that I really care but what was the point of raising the forage cap by 50 for us?</div></div><hr />

Yes!  Another highly situational spell that most likely won't grace a gemslot except on ultra rare occassions.  I ceased to function in any sort of primary DPS role long, long ago, and have zero use for a spell such as this that requires proper alignment of planets in order to receive any substantial benefit as I  chain nuke for a minute while ignoring everything else around me.  Enough already with the gimmick spells, just shave the cast time on my primary nukes and up their damage.<br />
<br />
 New Spell - Sharp Eyes<br />
A new permanent buff.  Good thing the PC buff slot count was increased.  I assume there's a reason why new mobs were given a new invis ability that is immediately negated by use of the new see-invis spell that eats up a new buff slot.  I have no clue what that reason may be.<br />

Immediately and permanently eats the 10th spell gem.  I can appreciate the concept of this Oh5hit! spell, although if I had a properly functional group heal to utilize I probably wouldnt have any use for an emergency group band-aid spell in the first place.<br />
<br />
Group Heal - CrescentBloom<br />
Fully expecting this to be just as lame as prior spells in the line (seeing as previous group heals have met with such high community acclaim).  However, is this instance, according to Rashere, &quot;if the spell is found lacking, there are strong chances it will be upgraded.&quot;   Right.  Let the wagering commence.<br />
<br />
Defensive Heal proc - Scales of the Reptile<br />
This change is retroactive.  Since the previous spell has been broken since inception, both old and new spells are now officially &quot;fixed&quot; to the point of being nearly useless.<br />
&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;<br />
  We inquired about combined debuffs, but they want more time to evaluate that request.<br />
  Development has been &quot;evaluating&quot; this request for what?  Seven years now since we last had a disjunction debuff?   Pull this other leg and it plays Jingle Bells.<br />
&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;<br />
  Foraging AA<br />
And this does what for me, exactly?  I havent failed to forage something on every attempt since Kunark expansion, and the existing double-forage AA also fails absolutely zero percent of the time.  Raising my forage cap provides me with what benefit?<br />
<br />
Nature's Boon AA<br />
&lt;o&gt;Second only to the Bind Wounds as the single most useless AA line.  Glad to see this one got upgraded.  /boggle<br />
<br />
&lt;/o&gt; The skill Meditate was increased drastically<br />
Again, this benfits me in what way?  If they are doing away with OOC Regen then certainly sign me up for an increased meditate skillcap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not all all excited about the new spells and AA's in this expansion, particularly when considering it will be a year before new stuff appears again.</div></div><hr />

I am very disappointed with the spells. Not going to comment about them more until I have used them.<br />
 <br />
I can't see the mana regen gain in the mask or skin line as any sort of improvement at all. It just keeps us at the same spot we are at now with the rise in mana costs the new spells will have.<br />
 <br />
For AAs... they look interesting, I am excited about those. I was expecting the costs to go up so not really disppointed or anything there. I really like storm strike, looking forward to getting that asap. Besides that I didn't really see any new ones, just upgrades. Am I missing some?</div></div><hr />

A new permanent buff. Good thing the PC buff slot count was increased. I assume there's a reason why new mobs were given a new invis ability that is immediately negated by use of the new see-invis spell that eats up a new buff slot. I have no clue what that reason may be.<br />
 <br />
The reason is (imho) that pretty much everyone in the game now has at least one piece of equipment that sees invisible.  Hell I think i have at lease 3 items that i wear all the time that have see invis as part of their worn focus.  So to offset this mudification they have introduced invis2.0, and we start the cycle again!</div></div><hr />

Basically, in PoP someone screwed up and drastically increased our ability to lower attack more then intended.  That's why there have only been small upgrades to one line, and likely why there hasn't been a Sunder line upgrade.<br />
<br />
Additionally, our ability to lower attack is pretty powerful, but it's not balanced against anything.  IE - We don't heal for less because of it.</div></div><hr />

Our payoff is presumably a better chance of foraging something good (higher forage skill gives you a better chance of a rare forage).  On the whole the AAs will significantly impact my game.  CoTW now has real battle rez utility in raids and will be far more useful in groups.  Upgraded snare, AA rune, AA nuke, and the usual improved percentage this and that.<br />
<br />
I do think that we should push for an additional spell bar, but that is a revolutionary rathe than evolutionary change.  Closer to the present we need to push hard on spell tuning.  <br />
<br />
1.  The Reptile changes drastically weaken the spell, which needs to be rebalanced on cost, recast, and procs.<br />
<br />
2.  Given the spell gem limitations we really should have the basic fire nuke have the dawnstrike proc added without increasing cost and cast time.  <br />
<br />
3.  The group heal is unacceptable - again, if they want to make it feeble it should be cheaper and have a faster recast.  And they should do the same for pallies.  They have a serious healing balance problem, and this is an obvious candidate for a fix.  I'll take 80% of a cleric's group heal, thank you much.<br />
<br />
4.  They gave us upgraded spell lines that didn't need to be upgraded.  Drop the level cap from skin to vines, icefall breath, etc.  If you upgrade these, do so by increasing the damage bonuses (and don't have the silly I/II/III mechanic - a single questable one will do.)<br />
<br />
5.  Degrading our epic is a big deal.  We have the right to expect that there will be a replacement - and, no, an endgame raid weapon is not a replacement for the epic.<br />
<br />
6.  Continue to push for debuff consolidation - it would do a world of good for permitting us to use all of these new spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a monk as well, we get an AA called killing spree, it's not bad, fires often enough if I get the kill shot but, nice thing is it replenishes some endurance as well. But, it also lasts 5 ticks not 4 like ours.<br />
<br />
I can only speak from my personal gaming experience but, in a group, I usually am primary healer or back up healer. If I am back up healer then my first job is to get on debuffs and then lay on a dot (if I can afford the spell gem), throw on a rain, then nuke while rain refreshes. For a 24 second buff to be useful, I would have to start nuking the next mob soon as it proc's.<br />
<br />
The primary reason to use this spell is not it's DPS capability, our other spells are better but, to use it so we can get the proc. To get the proc though you have to be sitting there over your spell gem, timing it, waiting till you think now, I'll nuke and the mob will die. For me when testing it in game, it felt very forced, very unnatural.<br />
<br />
What is worse, IMO when you have a melee in your group like a monk or ranger etc that also have ability to get procs from their killshot (if you are into the whole min/max thing versus trying to beat them to the killshot so you can get a crit out), then they'll get more benefit out of it.<br />
<br />
On the whole ability to lower attack as being powerful - that is yet to be seen. I am very skeptical to believe that it will have the impact that was quoted on the beta boards. One number I saw listed was 100 attack would reduce damage by up to 30%. With us being able to debuff attack by 300 and other classes being able to reduce it even further say what to 50% (I am sure crazy math lady can figure it out), do you think that a mob DPS can be cut that much ?<br />
<br />
I really don't believe it yet. I don't have parses but, last couple weeks of beta I played with my druid/monk in Dragonscale hills, laying on all debuffs on the mob with monk tanking, you'd think that I'd notice a 30-40% decrease in damage but, wasn't my experience.<br />
<br />
Am hoping to see what the rest of the druids that play in groups have to say. Remember the attack changes will be for mobs in SoF.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Still, I mentioned cast times to Prathun, butI know he was working on the Wizard changes several months prior to Beta even started.<br />
 <br />
But in the same vein, wizzies do more than cast ONE nuke. The balancing factor to justify lowering the cast time is a longer recast, but ask any top parsing wizzie just how often they chain cast just one nuke anyhow.<br />
 <br />
Anyone that's listened to a thing I've said knows that, for the most part, I'm an optimist and I enjoy my class very much. I'm fine with druid balance in the grand scheme of character balancing. Druids have it pretty damn good. On these boards, we complain about the efficiency of one spell over another because it is 1% less efficient than the last or stacking issues or combination debuffs (of course there are also the extremists who can't understand why SOE doesn't allow us to rez and heal entire raids with the click of a button, kill every mob in the zone with another and change our class name to GOD). I just don't have much pity for the druid. There are classes who complain on their that they've been completely forgotten for years.<br />
 <br />
Before I read the patch message I didn't care all that much because there was a class with bigger cast time issues. This is no longer the case. <br />
 <br />
I would gladly take a burst damage hit to reduce casting times.<br />
 <br />
Months ago Prathun mentioned that current cast times for nukes were ridiculously long for today's game. He was right. I don't understand how fixing one class and in one fell swoop of a two sentence patch note convert them from what has always been since day one the longest nuke caster class to the shortest is the solution to this issue.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
What can wizards do? i never really played a wizard but i looked on alla and wizard spells 60-75 are primarily nothing but nukes and ports.<br />
 <br />
ive always been in favor of game balance as long as it makes sense..and a class that doesent get a darn thing exept nukes and ports deserves faster cast times than other classes that have other benifits they do not.<br />
 <br />
why is the druid community in an up-roar about somthing as balanced as faster nuke timers on a nuke only class? if we lost all our heal spells and all our snare/root spells wouldn't we demand better nukes and start complaining &quot; why are our nukes just as slow as theirs when they have other benifits?&quot;<br />
 <br />
The wizard is not the most broken class is the game even with the reduced cast times. its the necromancer. lets compare the 2 :<br />
 <br />
Wizard can nuke<br />
 <br />
wizard can port<br />
 <br />
wizard cannot heal <br />
 <br />
Wizards cannot snare<br />
 <br />
wizard cannot xp rez<br />
 <br />
wizard cannot mez<br />
 <br />
wizard cannot slow<br />
 <br />
wizard has no dps-oriented pet as far as i know anyway<br />
 <br />
a wizard can draw agro fast with repeated nukes and can die fast.<br />
 <br />
Now the Necro :<br />
 <br />
necro's dps is easily a match for a wizards or at least a solid second place<br />
 <br />
Necro's cannot port<br />
 <br />
necro's can heal when they solo with lifetap<br />
 <br />
Necro's can snare<br />
 <br />
Necro's can xp rez with a 93% rez<br />
 <br />
Necro's can mez living mobs and undead mobs<br />
 <br />
Necro's can slow undead mobs<br />
 <br />
Necro's have the 3rd best pet in game in my opinion, 1st is mage 2nd is bst lord<br />
 <br />
Necro's have sick fast DoT cast times and crit abilities, they toss all their dots and then FD and then they cannot draw agro at all or die or even get hit.<br />
 <br />
what really /boggles me is everyone seems perfectly fine with the abilities given to a necromancer then one single nerf of a wizzy and the complaints start rolling in<br />
 <br />
   If i was gonna complain about a class and demand that it be nerfed or at least ask that the rest of us be brought in balance with, it would definately be the Necromancer.</div></div><hr />

If this is true, the truth will soon be out about necros and their dps capabilities.<br />
 <br />
Yeah I saw that and was very pleased.  It makes it possible to nearly parse everyone correctly in a raid, which pleases me to no end.<br />
 <br />
Still MIA for parses: Certain pet class procs and damage shield contributions going to the class that casted the spell.  Probably others I can't think of but adding dots is a big step in the right direction to attaining accurate parses for a raid.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Necros own DPS. That's not a secret :)<br />
 <br />
Very true! Necros' efficiency makes for great sustained DPS.<br />
 <br />
Here's what I've found in my experience (limited to my own guild):<br />
 <br />
- Wizzie = king of burst DPS - they can maintain over 2.5k DPS for the entire duration of their mana pool<br />
 <br />
- Melee DPS including rogues, monks, bers and rangers = Close 2nd - while burning discs they can maintain over 2.2k DPS but start dropping off over time to around 1k to 1.5k once the discs are burnt (depending on class)<br />
 <br />
- Necros = best average DPS for medium length fights maintaining up to 2.2k DPS for the duration of their mana pool, which typically lasts twice as long as a wizzie's<br />
 <br />
Mages and Beastlords = Hard to say, I can't really comment because it's only been recently that more sophisticated parsers have come out to combine them with their pet DPS and I haven't really paid much attention in the last couple of months (haven't had much time to play). What I DO know is that a mage can out-dps my best efforts if they're trying and BL total DPS is a lot better than most people give them credit for.<br />
 <br />
- Us = I've had parses as high as 1.2k without vet AAs. There's no feasable way I could burn a mana pool half as fast as a wizard, but long duration fights that allow us to burn an entire pool will put us in the top 10-15% of the raid.<br />
 <br />
Enchanters = HAHAHAHAHAHA, thanks for the recursion sucker. Best use of YOUR mana!<br />
 <br />
Again, let me just disclaim that this is my guild that I'm using as a reference. We're about 20th serverwide (as of our Mayong's Mistresses win) and haven't yet beaten Aprossis. Your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

Here is a question: didn't previous versions impact both DoT and DD crit damage range?  e.g. didn't they really just take one AA line and make it 2, or is this a new capability?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I think you are referring to focus effects that effect &quot;fire&quot; based damage spells to include fire nukes as well as fire dots. (or magic...)<br />
 <br />
The crit nuke aa's at first were just double damage (+ focus increase).<br />
 <br />
Then they gave Destructive Fury that gave increased damage on a critical nuke as well as increased chance to crit. This was split into the 2 separate functions. Now we have a separate line for more crit nukes from bigger crit nukes.<br />
 <br />
This aa will make it so when your dots crit, they do more than just double (+focus increase) damage.</div></div><hr />

I've updated the description to reflect this additional functionality.<br />

I still haven't discerned exactly what this spell is intended to do. The above description from Prathun reads:  this spell procs a DI recourse on other group members after I'm dead.<br />

<br />
<br />
Ressurect upon death sounds more like Divine Intervention to me, by means of a recourse given to the group, thereby providing them some chance to survive while huddled around my still steaming corpse.<br />
<br />
However, If it does indeed prove to be a DA/DB effect (invulnerable) then this spell should prove to be very entertaining chaos.   I die, and everyone else goes invulnerable, resulting in other healers that can't heal, a mezzer that can't mez, a wizard that can't evac, etc  :)<br />
<br />
Sounds like my way of taking everyone else down with me!<br />
<br />
Fun stuff!</div></div><hr />

Solarsliver isn't quested. Unfortanately I'm no help because I don't remember what zone it dropped in, but I got it late last night as a drop during a group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LegoleafMT</div><div class="date">11-17-2007, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the new see invis spell is slow loading, short duration, and outdoor only, resulting in the following scenario:<br />
 <br />
We're in a mission in Bloodmoon Keep, and 3 SoS assassins pop on our puller and just about own him before he can FD. Ah ha! thinks Lego. I have a super new spell for just such an occasion! So I load it up. And we wait...and wait...and wait some more. Finally it loads. And won't cast, cause BK is indoors. Once everyone stops laughing, I convince the monk to step out into Loping Plains for a quick cast. We zone back in and it's gone before he goes down the first hallway.<br />
 <br />
I'm all for situational spells, but that's ridiculous. You either need to burn a spell slot for it, or hold up the group for a few minutes while it loads. Then you need to be outside, and be able to rush right over to where you *think* the SoS mobs are. On the up side, I think once you've got them targetted you can see the targetting ring moving about once the vision fades.<br />
 <br />
I find Reaping Inferno to be quite useful strictly for the cast time.  A good bit of the time, by the time I get done debuffing, I don't have time to cast Equinox before the mob is dead.  But the nice fast cast on Reaping Inferno lets me toss a quick nuke in at the end.</div></div><hr />
