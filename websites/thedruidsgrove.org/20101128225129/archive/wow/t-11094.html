<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">09-22-2006, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 rings that should be easy to get:<br />
Primalist's Band<br />
Primalist's Seal<br />
<br />
Shoulders<br />
Animist's Spaulders<br />
<br />
All of those drop in ZG.  I like my Darkmoon: Blue Dragon card as my other trinket, it seems to proc a lot.<br />
<br />
Grind for Hide Of the Wild mats for a cloak.  <br />
<br />
And enchant your bracers with +24 healing and you'll keep those around for a while ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been thinking about a respec for a while now, as well as doing something about my healing gear, and I was just wondering if any of you had any tips on how to maximise my healing for raids (in terms of gear, enchants etc).  This is what I currently have:<br />
<br />
<br />
Zandalar Haruspex Bracers (http://www.wowwiki.com/Zandalar_Haruspex%27s_Bracers)<br />
Zandalar Haruspex Belt (http://www.wowwiki.com/Zandalar_Haruspex%27s_Belt)<br />
Feathermoon Headdress (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=36024)<br />
Jewelled Amulet of Cainwyn (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=19086)<br />
Hide of the Wild (http://www.wowwiki.com/Hide_of_the_Wild)<br />
Animist's Spaulders (http://www.wowwiki.com/Animist's_Spaulders)<br />
Animist's Leggings (http://www.wowwiki.com/Animist's_Leggings)<br />
Soulkeeper (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=6760)<br />
Sandals of the Insurgent (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=5046)<br />
Wildheart Vest (http://www.wowwiki.com/Wildheart_Vest)<br />
Band of Servitude (http://www.wowwiki.com/Band_of_Servitude)<br />
Zanzil's Band (http://www.wowwiki.com/Zanzil's_Band)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of going full 1/0/60 build.  Does anyone have any tips, as at the moment I'm balance/resto.  I also don't have any relics.  I was thinking of getting the Idol of Rejuv, but is it worth going for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">01-02-2007, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would just try to get Empowered Rejuv and Empowered HT in the Resto tree, and use the other points elsewhere. Well, unless u see nothing interesting in the other two trees at all.<br />
<br />
Hmm, after the Haruspex set, the next healing set would be Cenarion from MC, then Stormrage from BWL, then Dreamwalker from Naxx. Not much else is out there, unless u wanna go hybrid or something. Then again, BC comes out in two weeks, so things might be different.<br />

That's a decent upgrade over the soulkeeper, especially if you are lookign to get your +heal as high as possible.</div></div><hr />
