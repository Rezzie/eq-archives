As per Rogues and Warriors:<br />
You can take them, it just takes practice.  A rogue will likely get the jump on you.  You'll want to keep your distance.  <br />
<br />
Warriors you want to stay out of their charge distance so you want to be in closer with them. <br />
<br />
With both classes you want to keep moonfire and faerie fire on them as much as possble.  Less armor = more damage = dead faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everytime I see a rogue in BG I hit FF immediately, then root them so they can't do that jump around crap. <br />
<br />
Warrior is just an endurance thing, fight them in bear while popping out for heals (use bash/warstomp if you have it). The goal is to outlast the warrior here.</div></div><hr />

I've made &quot;good friends&quot; with a warrior orc &quot;Goodkiller&quot;.  We take turns killing each other.  I'll be in a group of like 10 people and he comes after me.  I must have pissed him off long ago ;)</div></div><hr />

I absolutely have no respect for rogues anymore.  Yes I know I am stereotyping right now but I don't care anymore.  As a matter of fact, I /spit whenever I pass a rogue (Yes, even the same faction).  <br />
<br />
It has been at least 5 times where I have been grinding mobs where a chest is...I'll see a rogue sneaking up like I don't see him, then all of a sudden vanish, then while I'm fighting the last mob in front of the chest, up pops the rogue and takes the chest.  Rogues are the lowliest of low in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Ahh...I feel much better now.  (Damn Rogues)  /spit</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues need the element of surprise to take out an enemy. Their class is made for this...so you really can't fault them.  Since I come from a PVP server, getting ganked before, during, or after you kill a mob is just part of the game. <br />
<br />
I must admit I loved ganking people as a feral druid (when I was lvl'n up).  I would always stay cat and keep my track humanoid on.  Talk about the anti-gank radar.  If I saw someone on track I would stealth and go check it out.  If it was an ally....GANK!  I don't care if they are attacking something or not.<br />

Some of my proudest moments are against them, as well as the ones that drive me absolutely nuts.<br />
<br />
I've used about the same tactic since I started BGs at level 39 (Bloodhoof, PvE server) Basically I start in cat form and stealth up behind them, show them how a backstab is supposted to work from stealth, then give em the regular stab, and shift to bear form (using moonfire as I go) then immediately faire fire them (do it when you were in caster form if you don't have the feral version) Rogues only wear leather so you can beat down what hitpoints they have left easy enough. When I get the jump on a rogue, I can take em down faster than a cloth caster who have more defensive spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
Now, when the rogue gets the jump on you, or catches you running the flag, Stunlock is the single most annoying thing ever, period. Even more so than shaman in general (I got a 60 shaman too, I know how much they can get under alliance's skin hehe) Not much you can do if they have you, unless you get lucky and help arrives. But as a rule of thumb I go Bear form vs melee (except hunters who try to back up and bow) and can have the DPS to do cat against casters.<br />

<br />
Tip: Remember you can abolish poison on yourself to take away the blind-effect (you have to cast it before it happens thou, but after a while, you'll know the patterns of the rogues). =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braylore</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course rogues are gonna vanish and backstab ya, that's their schtick.  Best way to deal with a rogue is to FF immediately... if they can't disappear, the rest is easy.  Less heals in Bear, and faster dps in Cat...or drop a root and Moonkin cast away, if you're balance spec. <br />
<br />
If a twinked/uber rogue gets the drop on you right away, you might be toast...if you survive the stun and backstab, hopefully you got a rejuve or some other pot, because you're gonna need it. Next: Stomp - FF - root - heal - Bear/Cat/Moonkin away.  <br />
<br />
Stuns are critical, don't forget to use them!  I will often stealth behind an unsuspecting ally, pounce-FF(feral)-shred-Fury-Rake-Claw-Rip/Bite... shift to caster and stomp-root-heal then shift to bear and enrage-charge-maul-maul-bash...rinse and repeat...switch to caster for heals.<br />
<br />
Only difference with Warrior is that you have to go Yogi (bear) in order to keep up with the dmg they deal.<br />
<br />
Keep a good supply of full health pots/rejuves...nothing irks me more than an ally near death that chugs a full health pot.<br />

Heh that is an awesome plan =) I think it would work too if the 3 Alliance hunters using me for a pincushion suddenly vanished too! Stuns are killer and that is an awesome setup if you can catch someone alone.</div></div><hr />
