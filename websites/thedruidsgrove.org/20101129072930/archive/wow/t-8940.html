<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaine260</div><div class="date">06-06-2005, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I am a 33 druid, and have been looking for quests to do for my level. The problem is I have done most of the quests that were for my level early. * IE I did all the quests when they were red when I should have waited *<br />
<br />
Anyways my question is I am looking for quests I can solo at 33. IE quests around level 28 but I am not sure where to go. I am an aliance druid. <br />
<br />
Also I have a Hunter friend who helps me on all quests and we do them together. If the quests you are thinking of is 33 I could maybe do it with her.<br />
<br />
Right now I am working on quests in duskwood, and Stranglethorn, and find that arthil Highlands ( think that is the area ) is too hard for me to go to. Is there another area I should go to to do quests? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance Kaine60 ( Glulayen Evernight EQ 1 and Glulayen in WoW )</div></div><hr />

I particularily like 1K to get there you will need to head down to Booty Bay in STV and take the boat to Rachet.  Once in Rachet you will need to head south to the great lift.  Avoid Crossroads at the great lift you can cat sneak onto the lifts to avoid guard spam or you can jump off the cliff and suicide ress at the graveyard below.  1K might not be the best place for you if you are on a PvP server since getting there is traveling through horde dominant areas however Shimmering flats is goblin neutral.<br />
<br />
Desolace is a bit higher but you can start quests there.  You'll need to go from Astranaar through the passage to Stonetalon Mountains and south to Desolace.<br />
<br />
I did a search on Allas for quests between levels 28 and 33, you'll have to hunt around in there for Alliance ones you haven't done but it's a start.<br />

What a place! Masses of XP, loads of leather, collecting money like it is going out of fashion!<br />
<br />
Think I might be here a while........</div></div><hr />

There are quite a few areas for grinding and leveling in the 30's. Desolace is the one place I didnt get to before with my hunter.</div></div><hr />

However, i ended up in Stranglethorn Vale around 34 or 35 and I still have about 7 quests in my log with more available as soon as i free up some space. And xp is crazy there as well. Either place is great I guess I just like the scenery better in SV. Those rock demons in Desolace do look cool tho</div></div><hr />
