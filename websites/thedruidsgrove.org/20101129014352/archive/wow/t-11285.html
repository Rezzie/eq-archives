<br />
Sadly, I do not have the game with me. Woe. Back at home, I have a level 37 NE Druid that's spec'd in feral (no surprise there), the end-specialization currently in debate. Since I can't play on WoW, I do the next best unproductive thing -- I research about it. Which brings me to discovering this board. Yay!<br />
<br />
But enough about me -- may I get a few introductions here? I like  meeting new people, after all. : )</div></div><hr />

This is a great Druid discussion place that is almost opposite of the DruidWoWForums which is full of whiners and QQ'ers.<br />

Question from an ignorant: What's a QQ'er?<br />
<br />
And I'll see if I can donate some. : )</div></div><hr />
