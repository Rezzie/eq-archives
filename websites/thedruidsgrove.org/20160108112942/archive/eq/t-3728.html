<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">07-31-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same place, same frogs.<br />
<br />
I gated in last Monday to kill some more giants for the usual loot (I'm at 549 AA, so I'm maxxed out as far as AAs go, and any AA XP is just going to the 30 point buffer at this point).   I'm not after frogs, although I use a charmed one.  No one is around killing frogs, as it turns out, so I grab one that's wandering by for a pet.<br />
<br />
After I kill several giants, I hear the following ooc: &quot;&amp;*Fk who's the frog jew??&quot;   First time I've heard this sort of idiocy in EQ, amazingly enough.  It's some little level 59 necro bigot who appears to be working on his KKK merit badges.  I detest /ooc fights about as much as I detest bigots, so I figure the best way to make my point is to immediately start killing all the frogs I see.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he goes LD or camps before I can make my point.  *shrugs*<br />
<br />
<br />
Two nights ago: same place, same frogs, and same bigot.<br />
<br />
I gate in for more giant killing.  Absolutely no one is around on tracking, and the wandering frogs are fully popped.  I kill several in the course of few minutes in order to keep them off my back while killing giants (I've been killed by them that way before), plus, the XP is nice.   <br />
<br />
After about 20 min, the fledgling KKK necro comes up, looks at me, and says, &quot;FF are camped!&quot;   Since it's the bigot, I point out that I've killed the last 8 frogs, he wasn't here, and he ought to be logging off to wash his white sheets.  <br />
<br />
He cusses, calls me an unpleasant name or two, then tries grabbing two giants to FD train on me.  He sends me a tell saying that he hopes I have exodus.  I take care of them, of course.  Without using exodus.<br />
<br />
He tries again with more giants, so I just evac out and gate back immediately to recharm my frog, avoiding the giants.  He can't get up because he's FDed underneath them, so I go off and kill the frog repops.<br />
<br />
10 minutes or so later I see him coming with another set of giants.  I've prepared for him this time by hasting my frog and SoWing it (you really don't have to snare your pet frog to kill mobs if you don't want to...SoWing does have its advantages!).<br />
<br />
As he comes up to where I am standing with my frog and starts casting his FD spell, I exodus.  Of course, my frog starts nailing him.  I gate back in time to see him running off in the distance to the tunnel, with my frog and several giants in pursuit.  I don't know if they ever caught him....:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, he started doing the same thing to one of my guildmates later that same evening...about as nice an enchanter as you would want to meet.  She tried to talk him down and reason with him, but he kept up.  She reported him, a guide showed up and gave him a simple warning.<br />
<br />
She sent me a tell the next day describing what happened, and saying she was never going to waste her time with guides again.<br />
<br />
My thought is that since killing the frogs matters so much to these twits, my best response is to simply kill all the frogs (or almost all) and shrug off their attempts to kill me.  The more time they waste trying to train me, the less time they are spending getting XP.  Meanwhile, I kill all the frogs and get some cheap entertainment to relieve the tedium of watching the AA XP roll in....:) <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.  I don't believe healing the necro would have transferred aggro anymore.  Regardless, I'd rather have him there underneath them helplessly watching me kill frogs...:)</div></div><hr />

Next time, you should goad him into spouting some more racist crap then /report it.  That's usually the quickest route to a permaban for idiots like that.<br />
<br />
You have to almost feel sorry for that necro when all his attempts at training and flaming backfire and work to your advantage instead.  I can just picture him becoming apoplectic and going red in the face behind the keyboard while you continue calmly about your business.<br />

It's nice to see that the anti-social EQ punks don't always win.</div></div><hr />

Now when i actually have the spell, the kiting group there makes me pissed cuz they can go to hoh whereass druid dont have that luxury for charming &gt;.&lt; Altho for the hell of it i devised another tactic for using snakes and bears as a pet for soloing.. not exactly efficient but something to do when its a dumbass guildy in the kiting group and i dont feel like getting them all bitchy. seems FF is always camped on drinal, and to think i advented that kiting group so much.... now it is a bane =( i just want to kill giants and then return the frog to its natural habitat /sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure the way it works is, if the heal is being cast before the FDer feigns but lands after he feigns, FD fails. If you start to cast after he feigns, it doesn't break feign. Never really bothered to play with my necro's life to find out if that's the case or not, but that's what I've been told.<br />
<br />
So, if I'm right, if you see him coming at you and time your heal right, you could really ruin his evening.  <br />

All it can do in that instance is transfer the aggro to the caster.  That's the only reason fd pullers dont like to be healed until they say so... it's to prevent TPW.<br />

<br />
Used to do that in lguk when i was camping assassin for a friend's mask, some level 13 rogue was hiding there, and he'd come back like every 20-30 min and ask if i'd get him a mask after i got my friends (I told him no from the beginning), so I started pulling wizard frogs, and getting him hit with their ae snare (and at level 13 it always landed), so 7 hours later, I got mask for friend (h8 that camp) got him ae snared one more time and ported out.</div></div><hr />

Kudos to your talent and aa's/gear to not have to continually gate or exodus to deal with these young-ins.<br />

Just when you think 200 aa's is enough, people with 549 still enjoy killing mobs :) <br />

<br />
Scirocco talks about another player who claims to be camping frogs, even though Scir has been killing them (this feeds into the old argument around TDG that the frogs in PoS can/cannot be camped). Scir then quotes this person as saying &quot;&amp;*Fk who's the frog jew??&quot; and that this person then on repeated occasions has tried to train Scir to death.<br />
<br />
&quot;&amp;*Fk who's the frog jew??&quot; is a racial slur, a bannable offense from Everquest and certainly not tolerated as a first person comment on these boards.<br />
<br />
Other folks post, commending to hear Scir's story and how this person is unable to train him to death, etc.<br />
<br />
Then you post your comment &quot;Scirocco, to me it sounds like you're the one with the biggoted view, just one look at your post shows many biased view points, perhaps you should go wash your mouth as he washes his sheets&quot;.<br />
<br />
So by calling Scirocco a bigot, you then put yourself in the same camp as the person using the racial slur.<br />
<br />
And with your post today, you're certainly not helping yourself.<br />
<br />
Now, if you can intelligently explain why I am reading this incorrectly, please enlighten me. =)</div></div><hr />

If calling someone a race/regligion name to imply they're cheap, cheating, stealing or whatever, isn't racist then is it okay to call someone Catholic to imply they're a child abuser?  <br />

BTW, Felicia, the reference to sheets is to the white sheets worn by members of the KKK.  After some thought, and finding out that you are not a US citizen, I suspect you took it as some reference to the Middle East conflict.</div></div><hr />
