Another question, can anyone tell me how the delay/damage ratio of the weapons changes the pets damage output. Can anyone explain that please?<br />
<br />
And finally, how does experience change with dire charmed pets.<br />

Not true. Give a level 1 (or 4, whatever) Necro pet a Weighted Axe (or something similar- high damage), send it against a newbie mob and see what happens. I'm not starting any rumors, but if you want to see what I'm talking about, try it.<br />
<br />
I primarily use Tentacle Whips. They drop from Tentacle Terrors in Najena. There are 6 or more scattered around the zone. It takes about 10 minutes to pick up a pair. The tentacle whips proc a tiny Lifetap. But hey, its hard to resist and its a small heal. Also, while picked them up, if the WidowMistress is up, you can pick up a Stilleto of the Bloodclaw.<br />
<br />
I used to use Gnoll Hide Lariets, but the proc doesn't affect 55+ mobs.  (I think)</div></div><hr />

[/quote]<br />
<br />
Just one thing to note, you CANNOT hand 2 of the same weapon to a pet.  If you do it will only wield one of them, so the weapons need to be different to get full advantage.<br />
<br />
Also if I recall correctly, pets will use the delay of the weapon and pets will use the damage of the weapon ONLY if it is higher than its natural damage.  Generally this means if you have a low level pet &lt; level 12 then high damage weapons are good.  but by the time you get into the 40's-50's you'd need to find 70+ damage weapon before the damage takes effect.<br />
<br />
So the best I've always received get a low delay weapon with a proc on it for most effect.</div></div><hr />

I have done some research at the necros forum, too, and came up with some usefull information. First here is a list of weapons people seem to use, the proc and the going price, which may be outdated:<br />
<br />
Velium weapons, 12pt dd, 10pp<br />
Gnoll Hide Lariat,&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Stun, 15pp<br />
Packmasters Lash&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp , 60pt dd, some stats,  22pp<br />
Tentacle Whip, 5pt lifetap, 34pp<br />
Dragon Horn Ykesha, 75dd, 50pp<br />
Staff of writhing, 84dd + stun, 88pp<br />
Smoldering brand, 14dd, 100pp<br />
Ykeshan War club, 75pt dd,  200pp<br />
Short sword of Ykesha, 75pt dd,  250pp<br />
Windetched Staff&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp , 99dd, 300pp<br />
Woe, 30pt dd + 126 dot, 440pp<br />
Di Zok Oracle Shillelagh, 70% Slow!!!,  500 - 6000 pp<br />
Venomous Axe of the velium Brood,  85pt dd, 2000pp<br />
Bloodpoint, 80pt Lifetap, 3000pp<br />
Locustlure, 30% Slow, 3000pp<br />
Steel hilted flint dagger, 622pt DD,  16500pp<br />
<br />
I guess the best bang for the money would be the Packmasters Lash, the Dragon horn Ykesha or the Staff of writhing. Uber would be the Di Zok Oracle Shillelagh - a pet that slows his own opponents? Wow.<br />
I guess I would give my pet a Steel hilted flint dagger if it would come with me if I had to exodus, lol.<br />
<br />
After reading the replies here and talking to some enchanters in game I am still not sure about some things:<br />
<br />
Does the delay of a weapon effect a pets damageoutput?<br />
Does the damage of a weapon effect a pets damageoutput?<br />
Can mobs above a certain level be affected by stuns at all? Somewhere I read that the gnoll lariat could only stun mobs up to level 55.<br />
Which mobs will dual wield after giving them weapons? All or only specific classes?<br />
<br />
I am sure that some mobs kill much faster with weapons. In Chardok give your sniffer 2 weapons and you will see. It seems to be between 25  to 50 % faster.<br />
<br />
A nice sideeffect of giving weapons to a pet is that they seem to hold aggro much better, so its easier to med or work with adds.<br />
<br />
Most of the time you can recover your weapons if you kill your dire charmed pet after a session. Sometimes a weapon seems to poof though, because I could retrieve 1, but not both weapons from an ex pet.<br />
<br />
Oh, and another nice tip from the necros forum is to keep a stack of tiny daggers on you so you never run aout of weapons for your pet I havent tried them yet). You can buy them in Bazaar for example.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the poor formatting, I have no idea how to make a proper table on EZ-boards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damage only affects pets if its better damage than they do normally.<br />
<br />
Mostly, people equip pets with weapons to activate dual wield and to get procs!<br />
<br />
Some classes equip pets with weapons to move them from the h2h table where they are capped at 100 skill(if pet is based on a warrior) to the slash/pierce/blunt tables where they are capped at a much higher skill level, therefore hitting more often and for more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldarion Shard</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with this discussion is it has worked at least 4 different ways during the course of EQ's development (i.e. from 3 years ago to now).<br />
<br />
so some folks are talking about one way it used to work, and others are talking about diffrent ways it used to work.<br />
<br />
to my knowledge, my statements above are true for the current game. (that is, delay and damage dont do anything, but procs do, and giving weapons activates DW skill)  the statements disagreeing with mine were true at one time, but no longer are.<br />
<br />
of course, empirical evidence can always overthrow any of these statements... anyone got it?</div></div><hr />

I don't know whether high level charmed pets act the same way though.  What I'd like to know is how risky is it to give a CoK pet or dire charmed pet weapons?  Is the only concern that a CoK pet will turn on you with your own weapons, or is there a risk of losing the weapons on either sort of pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maschana1</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With COK it hurts a lot to get the pet under control again if it hits you for 135 4 times in a row (old world, I dont even want to think what a POP mob would do to you).<br />
<br />
With dire charmed pets I mostly get my weapons back, but sometimes I only find 1 weapon though I gave it 2.<br />
<br />
Since my bank account is not that big I prefer not to give too expensive weapons to a pet.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, when you have to gate/egress/exodus it may be tough to get back to your pet or another player might kill it. When it gets killed while you fight the corpse poofs btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since a pre-Kunark patch weapon delay does &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; for a pet good or bad. However, stats on weapons appear to have some effect. Pets will not activate right click effects on their own. While I'm at it, pets also don't appear to get the benefits of focus items.<br />
<br />
A weapon's damage will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; affect your pet's maximum hit if the weapon's damage is more than half your pet's max hit. For most pets this side of EC this becomes irrelevant. NO DROP weapons and items are destroyed by pets and NPCs (changed a long time ago to prevent dodgy trading of NO DROP items).<br />
<br />
What you are mostly interested in is procs for weapons. Some summoned pets will begin dual wielding if given 2 weapons where they previously could not. I have not seen anywhere documented that this applies to charmed pets.<br />
<br />
Bang for your buck, find a Magician and get him to make you up a bunch of Blades of Walnan or whatever weapon spell they have. These weapons proc a ~140ish DD that scales with the level of the pet, and can be acquired for loose change form most Magicians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ecchu</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on the MOB you are fighting on what weapon to give to pet.  If its just normal mob I usually go for Staff of Writhing (can pick one up in 5 min) with a Flamesong (procs lots - 75dd).  If the mob is high dps I usually give pet a Locustlure and Di`Zok Oracle Shillelagh, or if its high resist I will give pet a Journeyman's Walking Stick or similiar Tash/debuff item.  It is really fun to see how much pet procs effect your soloing ability, I think most will be surprised lol.  All in all, i'd say carry around a bag of cheap high proc weapons, debuff weapons, and a slower or two just to test 'em out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">12-22-2002, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nearly any mob pre-pop (there may be ones that don't dual wield, but I haven't found any) will accept weapons and activate dual wield.<br />
<br />
Wolves in ME definitely will activate dual wield when given weapons.<br />
<br />
Same for dogs in Chardok.<br />
<br />
But the pet that I'm most familiar with, Drakkel Dire Wolves in Kael, I can go into depth on.  They range in level from 53 to 57, only the 53 ones are charmable with CoK (yes they summon), they have a max hit of... err, I *think* it's 233 (can't remember exact number atm).  Before giving weapons, they only double hit (double attack), after giving it a giant militia longsword and berserker's sword, it will quad hit (dual wield + double attack).<br />
<br />
I've parsed a maximal pet, dual wielding velium weapons, with Savage Spirit, a Muzzle of Mardu, and Shield of Spikes, at around 300-320 DPS.  This is OBSCENE (I was on a Vindi raid for DPS, and with the pet, in a group with a cleric and a DC enc with an arena guard, the guard died on enrage, as did about half the melees on the raid, my pet ended up tanking Vindi the last 5% or so, and our ghetto group got exp over the rest of the raid, which was using /raid).  Without Muzzle of Mardu or dual wield, the same pet parses around 180-200 DPS.</div></div><hr />

Lieutenants (or weaker) at the bank area, not much, I run off and recharm.<br />
<br />
Staff Sergeant Drioc, get summoned, run off (it regen's fast enough that I only get summoned once or twice and run off), recharm<br />
<br />
Captain Bvellos, depending whether or not the wolf is summoning (whether I've healed it recently), Bvellos summons me, I run off and abuse the funktastic pathing to egress (or recharm), or I get summoned twice real fast, and try to run off and egress.  Usually the second one is fatal.<br />
<br />
When I'm pulling the stuff from Tormax ramp (which all summons), well, usually if charm breaks after the fight starts, I get bent over and reamed.<br />

Usually I end up taking an average of 2 or 3 deaths in a 6-8 hour farm session.  But I also end up making 5-10k (easily, depending on drops) and an AA point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I try to use weapons that are dirt cheap, extremely easy to come by in the Bazaar or ones I can get with little to no effort myself.  <br />

They reduce the npc's dps output slightly and help me conserve mana on that aspect (depenting on what I am fighting of course).  Diz oracle shil's are great for slow and helping mana once again.  It also helps if you are fighting a summoning npc and charm breaks.  Sometimes it's worth it.<br />

Also some npc's cannot dual wield normaly even if given 2 weapons.  I found that in some cases you can have an enchanter pumpkin your pet.. and viola It will dual wield.</div></div><hr />

This is enough to keep it full HP even against Bvellos or weaker top arena mobs, so the wolf won't be in summon mode for charm breaks.  <br />
<br />
As a new fun thing, just tonight I soloed Lithiniath in PoM.  I had tried it offhand a couple times, using a regular yard skunk, and never managed it. skunk took too long to kill her, charm would break, or skunk get feared, etc.  Tonight, the named skunk was up in the yard, and with one charm break clearing trash, and one break right before I hit &quot;attack Lith&quot;, 3rd charm held thru her fight.  Pet skunk pretty much trashed her, she spent too much time casting, and I think the named skunk was high enough to be immune to her fear.<br />
<br />
NPC/charmed pets can only be given one of the same item.  Dunno why, but if you give a charmed pet two identical weapons, one will poof, and it still won't be dual wielding.</div></div><hr />

There is a list of charmable animals by zone.... somewhere on this site.  Been awhile since I tried looking for it.  CoT though.... it's a buggy charm to say the least.  For no reason it can wear off as soon as it's cast or last the full 15 minutes.  CHA has little impact on duration.  It's really all just a matter of the RNG being nice to you or not.</div></div><hr />

Is this true?  I posted a related question in eqdruids http://p203.ezboard.com/feqdruids24038frm11.showMessage?topicID=2284.topic  .  Basicially the answer was that some pop animals can (although i know from trying that rats in pod and stalkers in pon will not.  I still would like to get a more complete list of both pre-pop and pop dual-wielding animals based on people's experience.  How can you not love the dual wielding pigs in nadox!<br />
<br />
On a related question, i saw a reference that booboo can dual wield -- is this correct?  The times i've given him weapons (made a point to give one slashing and one piercing weapon) I saw no indication that he was dual wielding.<br />
<br />
BTW, only problem with processing weapons i've found is that they seem to me to break root.  As a chicken druid charmer, I still like to keep target rooted so that if charm breaks i only have to deal with one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">08-06-2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Booboo like all the summoned pets above level 20 can dual wield, however...Booboo's DW skill and his attack (ATK) are low.  If there is a beastlord or a ranger near you, it helps to get attack and dex buffs (dont buy these in Pok/Bazaar, they are short duration buffs).  Without buffs to increase the attack value, Booboo may go several minutes without a successful DW.  Also many weapon procs are level limited.  The magician summoned blades require the pet to be level 40 before they proc.  I usually give Booboo 2 magician summoned fists (cheap and proc at level 10), since his 1HB / 1HS / piercing skills are not much different from his H2H skill.  I do not give the summoned fists to most charmed pets, since they are usually warrior mobs and have much higher 1HB / 1HS / piercing skills than H2H skill.  Like all summoned pets, Booboo uses a fixed weapon delay (handing Booboo a fast weapon will not increase his damage) and he will not use any weapon with the lore flag. Booboo will use the damage portion of a weapons stats if and only if the weapons damage is higher than his base unarmed damage (this is why giving a low level mag/necro pet a 2HB weapon can greatly increase their damage).  Handing Booboo rusty daggers would increase his DPS only if a weapon was needed to unlock his DW skill (at his level he should DW without a weapon, but I am not interested in doing the several hours of parses needed to verify this).</div></div><hr />

I can't seem to find something i read in another thread -- which order you give weapons to have it wield in primary or secondary slot?  Am i correct that first weapon goes to primary, then you give second weapon -- first goes to secondary and last weapon given becomes primary?<br />

Finally, can booboo bash if you give him a shield?  That might be good when using booboo in a group as a  dot against caster mobs if so.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like I need to verify that Booboo will still DW.  This may take a few days, since I cant use the mob (you cant attack Soulbinders anymore) I used initially to verify that Booboo could DW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a 20 minute parse last night:<br />
<br />
Target : Shadowman  cleric<br />
Buffs: Natureskin, Replenishment<br />
Weapons: dagger (1HP), club (1HB) (both from vendors)<br />
<br />
Analysis of the parse showed Booboo using the dagger, kicking and bashing  (2 bashes over 30 points).  I also saw what looked like double attacks several times. There were no hits with the club.<br />
<br />
Booboo is not currently DW. I checked my old logs, he was DW during the period that Soulbinders could be used to test pets, but he was bashing for a maximum of 1 point.  As a guess he now is equipped with a shield when summoned.  This would explain the large bash damage, and since a pet will not unequip a shield why he will no longer DW.   It would be interesting to know if this change occurred at the same time that magician pets started being summoned equipped with plate armor.<br />
<br />
This is probably an improvement to Booboos DPS.  While he would DW before, his DW skill was so low he could go several minutes without a success.  He appears to be attempting a bash about every six seconds.</div></div><hr />
