    What I need from you before I can help.<br />
    <br />
    1. The Username that you registered under.<br />
    <br />
    - From there I will verify the IP address from this post to the IP you registered under and then Email you directly. <br />
    <br />
- If you put in an invalid address by mistake, a military address, or an address that you suspect the local spam killer is eating our registration emails, I will send from a different email address that will get through.<br />
    <br />
    2. Patience, I will take each request with the same care that I do all members of the Grove.<br />
    <br />
