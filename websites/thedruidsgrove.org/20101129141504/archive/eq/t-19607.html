Michael Morales changed my position on the death penalty.<br />
<br />
I was a kid in high school.<br />
<br />
Mike Morales had a cousin who was gay.<br />
And this cousin had a boy friend.<br />
Who broke up with him and started dating a 17 year old cheer leader from my school Terri Winchell.<br />
<br />
This cousin asked Mike, a wannabe gangbanger at the time, to take care of this problem.<br />
<br />
So Mike kidnapped Terri.<br />
Drove her out to a secluded vineyard.  There were tons of those back then.<br />
He beat her head in with a hammer.<br />
****ed her vaginally and anally with the hammer.<br />
Then he cut her breasts off with a knife.<br />
He was found guilty of this crime.<br />
<br />
In May of 2006 his legal team was able to convince a judge that the method of lethal injection was cruel and inhuman.  Thus UnConstitutional.  And there has been a moratorium on the death penalty in the State of California since.<br />
<br />
I never knew Mike Morales.  But I knew Chris Morales, his younger brother.  They both grew up in a house that was less than 400 yards from my house.  The first time I ever smoked weed was with Chris Morales and some friends, in his driveway, right across from Kofu Park.<br />
<br />
&quot;The judge further ruled that the barbiturates could only be administered  by a &quot;licensed medical professional,&quot; meaning a doctor, nurse or other  medical technician legally authorized to administer IV medications. Since all such medical personnel are bound by professional ethics  against performing an execution, this ruling virtually assured that the  execution could not take place.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know what professional ethics that wiki in referring to.<br />
I have not signed any legal document attesting to this.  Or sworn and oath, or any other such matter.  And to the best of my knowledge there is nothing that prevent me from administering medications which would hasten the expiration of a person such as Mike Morales.  And if such laws or such do exist I would volunteer, if a waiver of any professional discrepancies were to arise.  And do the community of California, and humanity a favor and end this person's life painlessly and humanely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure revenge killings are against a doctor's ethics.  And I'd be surprised if there weren't similar rules for other medical professionals -- though I'm not at all surprised that you don't know them.<br />
<br />
I hope they never manage to kill him or anyone else.<br />
<br />
The State should not be allowed to sponsor human sacrifices to appease the population.</div></div><hr />

Well, that oath is only for doctors. For one.  I don't even think it applies to ODs.<br />
<br />
Second, the Hippocratic Oath is a guild oath more than anything.  <br />
<br />
Any doctor who provides an abortion, or prescribes birth control, or inserts an IUD is in complete violation of the oath.<br />
<br />
2 years ago, the objection was a &quot;licensed medical professional&quot;.<br />
<br />
The judge further ruled that the barbiturates could only be administered  by a &quot;licensed medical professional,&quot; meaning a doctor, nurse or other  medical technician legally authorized to administer IV medications <br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Morales<br />
<br />
And I don't even need barbiturates.  There are hundreds of medications which would put him to sleep with no pain(other than insertion of IV) whatsoever.  Medications which I am expert in, and trained and licensed to administer.</div></div><hr />
