<br />
i have the gem all ready but only got the old epic pvp merciless helm to put it in and i dont actually use that now !<br />
<br />
given i dont raid what is my easiest item to get a meta socket in....i am in need of a good helm so was thinking i may have to once again go the pvp route ?<br />
<br />
options ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
H-VH / H-Nex / H-Occ all have nice leather helms that take meta's, it just depends what spec you want?  I think H-Occ has the best feral, but an unskilled team in there will leave you with nothing but repair bills.<br />
<br />
I am assuming when you say you don't raid you mean 10-25 man content.  If you meant you don't 5-man, then I think you are SOL.  But if you don't 5-man there is really no need for a meta gem anyhow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
had lack of time for a while now so not been 5 manning either and main people i know levelling alts / DK's but plan is to properly start 5 mans - heroics. by end of month.<br />
<br />
so looking for easiest item to aim for to get meta socket, i was thinking only helms seem to have meta's but was not sure !<br />
<br />
<br />
lol need a new tank weapon now to - no point using Earthwarden anymore ! :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
since you only have to be revered with them which is pretty much a given if you do all of icecrown, i would say Quest Quest Quest :)<br />
<br />
its kalled skeletonmasher or something and you get it at the argent vanguard from the rep vendor</div></div><hr />

<br />
i found some blue 2h staff to use last night in the bank !  more AP than anything else i had so a reasonable replacement for Earthwarden which is now consigned to the bin :( /cry<br />
<br />
i also noticed a Titansteel something in the AH with 1800AP and other nice stats but going for about 4000g !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you can, run H-VH, even if you have to PUG it.  You will get a great staff, &quot;Staff of Trickery&quot; and a shot at a helm with a meta slot.  <br />
<br />
There is also some very nice boomkin/Resto stuff in there too.  It takes ~22 mins and can easily be PuG'd.  (Make sure you know the tricks for the harder bosses)</div></div><hr />
