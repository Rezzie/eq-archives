<br />
If you are nearing 70, and looking at getting to the end game, then I'd say go for enchantments on gear that you know you aren't going to replace shortly.  For any druid looking at getting into KZ, enchantments are considered a requirement by some guilds to help with the progression in the raiding.  <br />
<br />
Enchantments vary widely.<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Enchanting_by_Item<br />
<br />
This is a pretty good list of what you can get.  Pretty much, you look for enchantments that support your spec/build/role in the raid or instance.  I didn't really look at enchantments until I got to the end game for my druid, but my enchanter runs around with enchantments most of the time (of course that's also a function of her needing to skill and just doing her own gear first.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-09-2007, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't bother with enchants (unless they are free and/or cheap) unless they are being placed on a lvl 70 &quot;blue&quot; item.  I've heard many suggest that you not bother until you have a &quot;purple&quot; item.<br />
<br />
That said, I've put cheap (20g or less) enchants on a few green lvl 70 items that for whatever reason I haven't been lucky enough to replace.  All the rest of my enchants are on blues/purples.<br />
<br />
One more thing, some of the enchants listed require pre-BC mats which can be very, very costly as almost no bothers to farm them anymore (like odd drops from MC, etc.).  So, if the enchant appears to cost too much, see if there has been a newer BC based enchant that replaced it.</div></div><hr />

Only buy them if you know they are gonna last a bit (or if you absolutely need it for progression). Certain pieces (such as the Clefthoof pieces) are worthwhile to enchant imo as they are very good tanking pieces.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-10-2007, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of times people are selling enchants for a &quot;loss&quot; just so they can get skill-ups. You'll frequently see someone selling 12 strength to bracer for 2g, when they could sell the mats for 10g. Or they are doing the enchant for free and just asking for a tip. For a couple gold, you might as well get the enchant, even if it's a green item that will be upgraded in a level or two.</div></div><hr />

Where did you get that Thrallmar rep reward?  All I can find is fire and healing increase no dodge increase for head slot</div></div><hr />
