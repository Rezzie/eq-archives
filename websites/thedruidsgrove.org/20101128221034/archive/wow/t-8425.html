<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aitrus</div><div class="date">02-22-2005, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the cat form better just because you have more things to do besides spam maul and then bash once a minute.<br />
<br />
You can ravage, shred, rake, tiger's fury and rip in addition to spamming claw.<br />
<br />
Bear you mostly just stand there spamming maul. I'll enrage+bash every minute, and demo roar, but its just not the same. You only get 1 way to deal dmg (unless you count swipe which is pretty useless in most situations).<br />
<br />
Stealthing around tracking humanoids is also sweet.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we all know cat form is gimp, while bear form is domination. So in practice I use my bear a lot more, but I like the speed of energy use better than the slow waiting-game of rage.</div></div><hr />

I use both bear and cat form depending on what I'm doing. In a tough fight I'll use bear but if it's an even match, non casting mob I like to use cat form for the speed, plus as said above, it's more interesting.</div></div><hr />

Bear=ultimate tank so far.  My druid is 24, and I MT-ed VC at lvl 22 (proxi-pulled the whole thing too) in a group of myself, 2 mages, a priest and a palli.  All of us were between 19-23.  We ran thru it in about an hour.  It was after that I realized the potential of the druid class.  <br />
<br />
I also LOVE cat form though.  When ya have a taunting tank, or another druid in cat form, it's wicked dps.  Both forms are very useful, and imo very fun.</div></div><hr />

Bear all the way, cat form just gets squished. Even though it does decent damage, it still isn't enough to compete with enemies of the same level. Stealth is great, though.</div></div><hr />

I use Bear and Cat evenly when I solo.  I use Cat more in groups, but Bear when we get adds, pull to many mobs, or I am the designated tank.  Tanking instances is SO much fun.

I needed to farm out a couple of large fangs, so I went down to the swamp to kill some shadow panthers.  Not a good drop night, I ended up with about 105000 points on my log, with a 5% crit ratio (only reflects melee crits)  This was in my tank gear, str focused, but not maxed by any means.  As the cats are quite soft, I changed to my agility gear for the next one and continued to farm till I again hit 100000 points.  In my agility gear I melee'd at 10.6% crit.  Not huge, but intesting as it was a long term test.  Plus the big thrill of stealthing a couple of upper 40 horde :P cat is fun :) more so I think than me bear when it comes to goofing off.</div></div><hr />

I only use cat for stealth and track.  That's it.  I stealth, then pop out for the starfire+root at a distance.  Hammer with SF until roots break, moonfire, faerie fire, then bear.  At level 46, I'm pulling 1k+ crits with starfire, so I rarely hafta shift out before end of battle.  In the event I do, it's bash, heal, FF if I have time, then back to bear.

<br />
Cat - similar level single mobs - tracking\ganking - DPS on bigger bosses<br />
<br />
Bear - large numbers of lower level mobs (for the rage) - off tank\healer - aggro puller (mid battle) with challenging roar.<br />
<br />
I use cat more than bear i think but that's because I solo more than group i think.  <br />
<br />
There's little point in going cat in a group if you have a mage or rogue in the group as you'll be battling to pull off finishers and those precious combo points will often go to waist.<br />
<br />
my personal fav shifting combos? <br />
<br />
cat - stealth hit from behind and max combo out finishing with DOT finisher then swapping back to elf\tauren buffing NG on me and FF on them then Moonfire and range nastiness all the way.<br />
<br />
Bear - normally a reverse of cat.  Hit em with root and FF go OTT with range attacks, once roots drop buff meself with NG and regrowth and lay the smack down as bear, if the NG kicks in back off and plaster meself with a regrowth, rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
:D<br />

I generally solo in Cat form since you kill so much faster. Against a pull of multiple mobs I'll open with ravage, apply some dot's and then go bear.  If I pull a lot like say 3+ mobs I'll stay bear the entire time and let my BP sleep the adds.  In groups I of course use bear if I tank, but more often I end up going cat and shredding for DPS.  My least favorite form is caster form, unless I'm forced into a healing role I spend as little time as possible in it.<br />
<br />
In PvP I usually stealth in cat from and either take out a soft target in cat form or I stay stealthed until I heal and go Bear since healing draws a crowd on me almost instantly.  I spend probably 75% of my time in BG's in bear form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for BP sleep.  I wear a breastplate that has a 5% chance to put anything that hits me to sleep.  As long as I can tank a group of mobs long enough eventually all but one falls asleep.   Just last night in Arathi Basin I got jumped by three rogues while in bear form while taking a flag and it put all 3 of them asleep.  Unfortunately one woke up before I got the flag but it was still a funny sight to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really really hopes its for implementation of a dire cat form quest.  One that would increase run speed in normal cat form.  Yes, you may say that would take out the need for travel form, but my arguement to that one is:  After you get dire bear form would you ever use NORMAL bear form just for...nostalgia....or something?<br />
<br />
Or, perhaps a better travel form upgrade...Shamen who outrun me make me angry, and I already HAVE 2 points in Feline Swiftness.....&gt;_&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But, enough of my thread hijacking hijinx....I prefer cat form....the faster attacks normally allow me to kill fast enough not to notice the lack of bear armor.  I only assume bear form when I KNOW I am going to fight multiples.  If I get an add while fighting, I will usually drop cat form, warstomp, assume bear form, and continue.<br />
<br />
Both have their uses, but I find myself in cat form more often due to travel and attack speeds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hunt with a buddy who is also a Druid, spec'ed as Resto.<br />
<br />
Being spec'ed as Cat makes this form much more viable in 1v1 PvE solo, even more so with a healing partner.  I can effectively kill 1-2 mobs within 2 levels of my own at the same time, morph out after battle, rebuff and quick heal, and I'm back in cat stalking my next kill.<br />
<br />
PvP is fast and furious as well. <br />
<br />
There are very few places that my buddy and I can't go and at least hang, plus when the @#$% hits the fan, we can both trans into Dire Bear and just simply wear out the opponent in old fashioned hand to paw.<br />
<br />
The Druid is the most versitile, well balanced class in WoW.  We can be strong at whatever aspect we choose to be strong in like Cat (Rogue), while retaining the secondary skills of the other aspects like Priest and Warrior.  <br />
<br />
I challenge any other class to say the same.</div></div><hr />

i cant tell u how angry my friend gets when i duel him. he goes into his whole stunlock routine and as long as i start off in bear it usually ends sad for him.<br />
<br />
even with dal'rends his attacks dont too that much to me. and with 0/30/21 build when i get low i just pop out, NS, full heal, back into bear. now im at about 75% health, still got good ammount of mana, and guess who used all his cooldowns...? :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Usually, I solo with cat because I can take down mobs pretty fast.<br />
<br />
But if I get ganked by adds I switch to bear in which I can take on and defeat 3-4 mobs 1-2 levels higher than me at a time.  The thing about bear form is that swipe becomes more and more awsome the more mobs you fight.  Everytime you get hit, you generate rage.  So the more mobs beating on you, the fast you generate rage.<br />
<br />
And because swipe hit's multiple mobs, your odds of gettting a crit are really high.  (I have 21% crit chance).  Each time I crit I get 5 rage.  So getting rage while swiping and attacking and getting more rage by being beat on = as much rage as I need.<br />
<br />
Against mobs of my level I have about 65% damage reduction (not counting demo roar).  When you have like 5k HP and nearly 9k armor, mobs can barely touch you.  I take something like 27-33 damage from standard melee attacks from mobs.<br />
<br />
Then there's frenzied regeneration, healing 200 HP per second is insane. And means that I'm pretty much never in danger when fighting multiple mobs. <br />
<br />
So all in all, I favour my bear form, but I still use cat for soloing the majority of the time.</div></div><hr />

Bear is probably more easier to solo with because of more health but I was just using cat form in RFK (2 cat druids, 1 warrior, 1 priest, 1 rogue) it was awesome. Most fun I've had in an instance since my first Wailing Caverns :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bear is ugly, has a big butt and seems slow. It is a great tank though. Hard to beat when backed by a decent healer.<br />
<br />
Feline swiftness rules, and its well worth it before level 30.  Just sucks, like roots, that it doesn't work inside. Seems silly to me, what cat can't be fast inside? Makes it tough in dungeons, as you just seem slow overall. :ohwell: <br />
<br />
Same with the travel form. <br />
<br />
It's great fun to not be required to heal or tank and get to slash with the cat. I've done this a few times on dungeons and topped the damage meters. Nice.</div></div><hr />

I'm 38 right now by the way.  Last night I was soloing Rumbling exiles in Arathi Highlands and things were just fine for my Cat form.  Then I pulled a lvl 39 exile and it started to totally beat me down.  It was constantly stunning me and I could not even hit it to get a combo point.  I healed and switched to bear and with very little stress killed it.  It took longer for sure but I was not really worried about dying.  <br />

In bear I have about 2400 AC.  Cat form I have about 1090.<br />

<br />
As with just about everything druids ever do Cat and Bear are situational i just go with whatever the situation calls for or what i think i can get away with *grins*<br />
<br />
PVP is also situation dependant, If i am playing midfield defense (a role i love) i am usually in bear basically i play a blocker no one gets past me going eather way much &lt;3 for Feral charge then swichin to Cowform and rooting. If we are short of capable runners or no one has taken the role on i ususally will catform in nice and sneekly like then drop down from the roof (Feline grace keeps stealth from breaking) walk over pop out grab the flag and depending on who/what is defending i make an on the fly decision weather to exit in bear or cat(dash) then pop into travel form and take it home.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm level 52 not 60. This is my experience so far.<br />
<br />
I was a long-time cat fan (from lvl 20 til mid 30s), because of the DPS, stealth, and feline swiftness.<br />
<br />
But then I started MT'ing, and I realized just how effective bear is at tanking. Bears are excellent at holding aggro, and they can take a pounding in dire bear form.<br />
<br />
This game is centered around instancing and raiding. And a group with a good tank has a much easier time than one without a good tank.<br />
<br />
Bears, esp feral-spec'd bears, make excellent tanks.<br />
<br />
Bears have the same threat generation (130%) as a warrior in defensive stance. And most feral-spec druids will take at least 3/5 in Feral Instinct, boosting threat up to 139%.<br />
<br />
My ability to hold aggro and survive is better than the majority of warriors that I've grouped with. Partly because of spec (most warriors are not prot-spec'd), partly because of gear, and partly because the majority of warriors don't understand threat mechanics. I see a lot of warriors trying to tank:<br />
1. not in defensive stance, and/or<br />
2. without a 1-h and a shield, and/or<br />
3. without using threat-generating skills like Sunder Armor<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've come to love tanking. The ability to keep a pack of mobs glued to you while your group members can attack is awesome.<br />
<br />
I have read that cat form is not very good end-game. At that point, rogues far outshine us in terms of DPS. Cat DPS doesn't scale, whereas rogues continue to get higher and higher DPS weapons. And rogues can dump aggro better than we can.<br />
<br />
I've read that bears can tank very well through most lower-to-mid level raids, until Naxx. At that point, warriors can get the Dreadnaught set, and by the numbers, warrior tanks have a clear advantage at that point. But getting to Naxx is a longgggg road.<br />
<br />
If you haven't tried tanking, I recommend reading this awesome writeup from Hugehoss:<br />

Im level 26 atm and I shread through mobs.  I know bear is best against multiple mobs or even a really nasty high level mob.  I dont know why people say you can only be effective with cat for mobs lower than you.  I routinely pwn mobs 2-4 levels higher than me.  I might have to change to elf to heal at times but if you know how to play your toon you can do this easily and mobs drop MUCH faster with the kitty :)  Try sneaking up on your mobs and shred their asses to get a head start on the dps.  They often will not recover from a nasty shred before you win the hp war.  Cat=fun, Bear=blah.</div></div><hr />

I'll use bear form if against multiple mobs for the AC and to swipe, but for sheer DPS, hit and run, stealth in and out, I love my cat. And the attack speed is great for disrupting casters. Although I've successfuly tanked the Princess in Mara in bear form at about level 50 or 52 (with 2 pallys healing), I find the cat is more useful in groups when I'm not healing. My guild seems to like it that we can group without a rogue and a priest if we need to when I'm along (in 5 man groups), but they RARELY ever want to go without a warrior. The cat form is, to me, the epitome of what I like about being a druid- versatility.</div></div><hr />
