I'm currently really into PvP and I've searched the WoWC Official Forums and Website to try and find what the lvl restrictions are for PvP Rankings; ie what is the highest rank you can have at a specific lvl. I'm currently lvl 33 and a Master Sargeant (Rank 4) but wondering if this is the highest rank I can have at this lvl and what lvl I have to be to get the next highest rank.<br />
<br />
Since most of my day is spent behind a nasty firewall, if someone could cut and paste what the lvls are instead of providing a link, it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

I think I once saw a non-level 60 rank 5 or 6, but the amount of time required to get there probably isn't worth it - since you have to PvP more than you would at level 60 in order to gain the same amount of Honor Points.<br />

It will become easier for you to gain rank at 51+ once you can do Alterac Valley.</div></div><hr />

 So far you have done very well getting your MS rank at only lvl 33 however its only going to get harder and harder. Competition for rank is based off of the cp's( contribution points) you get for the week compared to every other MS no matter what lvl they are.                                                                                   So say there are 10 Master Sergeants, 1 being you and the other 9 are all lvl 60. It dosent matter how many cp's you get if they all get more than you, you will not rank up. At lower level ranks this dosent come in to play as much but as you get higher the competition gets very tough. One missed day can put you way behind the pack.<br />
  If im wrong here on anything dont hesitate to correct me.<br />

  I worked my way to Lt. Commander and decided that was far enough. My highest cp week was 325k i think when alot of others were getting 500-800k. I simply could not put in that kind of time so i gave up heh.</div></div><hr />

So to actually beat them in CP, you need alot more HK's and BG wins... if you have 100 HK's and a level 60 has 100 HK's he'll more then likely have a signifcant advantage when the weekly tally comes.</div></div><hr />

  Oh ya. Extrememly good points that I forgot to mention. It takes to much time to keep up when your all the same level. I would have to say that keeping pace with lvl 60's when your only 33 would be impossible.</div></div><hr />

Apparently for the week's standing I am 613 (or something close to that)....so I did better this past week than the week before (1337 in standing....funny huh?).</div></div><hr />
