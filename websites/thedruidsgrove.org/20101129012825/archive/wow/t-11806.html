<br />
not that I dont mind, I even have Lunar Fury downloaded onto my PSP!<br />
<br />
but I'm going to make a moonkin PVE video, show my way of playing it, and how capable of being a DPS they really are. now, one thing I defiantly need to show, is a part where a shamen throws on bloodlust, and I throw out a good 30-40 wraths in thous 30 seconds on a boss monster,  but then..that wouldn't be very epic on it's own, I mean its impressive, but its with help of others, I ask you this Druids Grove, where should I show off my skills? PVE wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It attracts attention.<br />
<br />
So obviously a lil bit of that can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Beyond that pve wise I'm not so sure how you could make it anymore interesting....</div></div><hr />

The weakness of the moonkin is the lack of aggro manegement, that's why it's not as good as other DPSers.<br />

And tbh.. who wants to see a PvE-movie with a guy spammin wrath for 30 seconds on a boss. YAWN anyone? :p</div></div><hr />

They really don't thus why you don't see really any pve videos.<br />
<br />
Only thing you can do as someone stated in do short clips of the rediculous crits.<br />
<br />
