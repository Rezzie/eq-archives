<br />
Pickups and hard adventure do not mix.<br />
<br />
In addition, most guildies HATE ldon.  They would rather sit at a safe static camp and pull.  I fall asleep at those sort of things.  Must be why I don't log on except for guild events anymore.</div></div><hr />

Good drops, adventure points and great xp for me =) Though sometimes it can go really wrong like failing Tak  hard  2  in a row =p. Tak sucks !</div></div><hr />

If your group can't regularly win on hard, the loot alone might make it worth doing hard level adventures anyway...<br />
<br />
Oops, I guess I should clarify...that's hard at level 65.  There's a big jump in difficulty but also a big jump in loot quality too.  Loot from hard adventures at 60 and below probably isn't all that good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would've chosen it instead. Normals put me to sleep. Even so, stuff rots a lot in hard. They need to upgrade the no drop stuff or, better yet, get rid of the no drop tag. It's getting ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I would perfer them anyday. Most groups I end up in are pick-up groups. It takes atleast one normal level adventure to get a feel for the group, and hardly ever do they stay together in full longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glynna1</div><div class="date">01-23-2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been doing more and more hard adv than one per week. Actually have been healer in two of them now. Is quite fun and challenging. Both times we succeeded. First time after we won we tried for a named and it didn't go so well. I ended up dying from heal agro and the two wizards and myself had already used exodus. The only other death was the main tank during the adventure. <br />
<br />
Second time had good back up healing (shaman) and Bst for paragon. Although I would prefer a cleric in the group on a hard adv, I would do this again with similar people and also the people in the groups both times were people we all knew and reliable.<br />
<br />
Wanted to add Pally and ranger also able to heal so lots of healing available on this last hard adv.<br />
<br />
Was a Guk adv which I have heard are the most difficult.<br />
<br />
Have to correct myself on what I hear is the most difficult. Ruj appears to be the hardest with hasted mobs, you can really take a pounding if you don't have the right group make up</div></div><hr />

My vote has changed.  We complete and win 5-10 hard dungeons per week, but when this poll started we weren't doing them at all.  Since then we have greatly upgraded our gear and AA's in our regular group - mostly through LDoN - and we can do these now - and sometimes easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stewwy</div><div class="date">03-02-2004, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow that's kinda funny that Glynna said Ruj were the hardest.  hehe That's all we do.  Like 18-5 there now on Hards in Ruj.  We like Ruj for the potential loot that everyone needs AND the mobs are typically spread out nicely.  Tak mob distribution and aggro is the SUCK on normals and someone couldn't pay me to do a hard.  I fear guk Hards mostly because of hte poor mob distribution, but I think we need to try them because Normals are just too boring and Guk is the lastp lace I need favor.<br />

It usually takes 15 minutes to get a group together (minimum) and about an hour (if your group is half-decent) to do.  I've done one hard adventure and it wasn't much different from the normal except the mobs were about 2 levels higher.  It wasn't pretty when the ranger decided to ninja adventure.</div></div><hr />

Yes, after awhile the dungeons can get rather boring, but how much more interesting is sitting in one place in some zone and having mobs pulled to you over and over?<br />
LDoNs provided a way for the non-raiding player to upgrade their gear, but I could see where it did not provide that much in upgrades to someone in a raiding guild or who is EP flagged.  I do know some people liked the augments and the upgrades on their charm.<br />
I have had some bad experiences in pick up groups, but I have also met some wonderful and fun people.<br />
I hated the fact that it took so much time between forming the group and then doing the adventure.<br />
I still have some items I would like to get from LDoN, but it definitely is deserted.  People are in the OoW zones trying to get loot and runes before SoE completes their post expansion drop nerfs.  Also, I have heard that experience for over 65 people is horrible in the LDoNs since they were not adjusted to work for the higher levels.  I guess I was too pokey getting LDoN adventures when it first came out and now it seems like it's too late.   :(</div></div><hr />
