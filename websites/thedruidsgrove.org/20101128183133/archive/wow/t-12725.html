<br />
I have heard of a druid being able to solo Onyxia and am just wondering what other Old Skool high end dungeons a druid has been able to solo, and any bosses. I haven't been able to find any videos anywhere, other than the Onyxia one, but am wondering if some of the ZG, MC, or AQ bosses have been solo'd. Once I hit 70 and begin to get some better gear I plan to explore these options myself, but want to hear if there are any here that have done any of those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can solo Hellfire Ramparts at level 70 you are doing well :&gt;  But realistically you would need to gear up a lot first before you would be able to kill the final bosses in that instance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohnoto</div><div class="date">07-11-2008, 06:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I saw that video also. Not sure what all the gear he had on was, but he did have Staff of Beasts (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25761) So I am wondering what other gear he did have. Most people don't list out what they have.<br />
<br />
There are alot of videos out of Protection Warriors solo'ing the panther boss in ZG. Though it was implied, I didn't necassarly exclude my searching to raid dungeons, I was also wondering about BRD, LBRS, UBRS (though you need 3 people for the altar, I know). There is too much coordination needed for alot of the raid bosses then what will ever be available, but seeing as some of them have been done, I was just curious about anyone that might have done these also. <br />
<br />
Too many people go into these old school raid dungeons and think that they can just blast the bosses with DPS and wonder why they wipe on something that was more simple at level 60. They don't understand the coordination needed, or that the boss level is the high level cap +3 levels, so the boss wont resist all the attacks.</div></div><hr />

I found out that Ratty and the &quot;doctor&quot; mini boss where the hardest hitters. Gandling was cake but i skipped the boss that mirrors herself (forgot her name...:bonk:). All considered it was great fun<br />
I have never even tried to solo 1 of the TBC instances, i really think they will be hard to handle.<br />

One of my hunter guildies have done BM solo so I am tempted to try that one.  We did 3-man dps Arcatraz and Slabs a few times with a couple of wipes at Murmur.</div></div><hr />

What was your armor &amp; HP?</div></div><hr />

There were a few pulls that I died when it was too much to handle especially when they had casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohnoto</div><div class="date">07-14-2008, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of those stats I have, some I don't. Me defense is at 350, but I don't have the res to back it up. Im working on getting druid defense gear and high armor amounts, I'm sure that I will be giving this one a try soon. :)</div></div><hr />
