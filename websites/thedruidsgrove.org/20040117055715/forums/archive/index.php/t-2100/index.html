<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search but didn't come up with anything. <br />
<br />
My guild did NTOV for the first time over the weekend, and to my great excitement I am now bound in the Plane of Mischief. So, anyone here have experience with that zone? I know about the Plane of Mischief site, and will be reading more there, but I wanted a druid's perspective. What's the best fun you ever had here? Great things to hunt? At least for a while a few of my guildies are there too, so things we might do together are good, as well as solo stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm 58 and they're all higher than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quaras Shadowscythe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok...<br />
<br />
Step 1, rebind yourself if you can inside the large room with the treasure chest in the castle.  Its the most convenient spot and very safe.  It is also centrally located in the zone.<br />
<br />
At 58, the best xp would probably be the ratmen underneath the castle inside the maze.  They are easy to reach through trap doors near where you are bound.  For maps and instructions (and many other pieces of sage wisdom) try planeofmischief.com if it is still up and running.<br />
<br />
If the ratmen underground are too tough, go back outside where the port in from NTOV was and work on the pansies/flowers.  Clear the outside of the invis traps if you can and then herd them into a corner and avoid them.<br />
<br />
I will try to post more when I can think of stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rynz NReap</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do puppets, you really need someone to show you how, but can be done solo easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Went in tonight with a guild group, and had a lot of fun. We went through the Alice wing, which is awfully easy at this stage of the game (our 'chanter was meleeing, heh). We'll see how it goes solo. I'm really enjoying it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alaten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Must... have... DC <br />
<br />
Inside the secret NW wall there's a passage, take it all the way till the pain in the arse Ricococulous or whatever and stop, back up 10&quot; and go in that door, on the left hand side is Teence the Naysayer, he's your DC man, charm him then run down and kill the gorilla king (for practice). Then run up to the theatre and either kill puppets or audience. <br />
<br />
With a 65 cleric and 65 druid you can clear all the puppets and all the audience before 5am. <br />
<br />
My advice is to not kill Teence or Buzzer after you're done because they take a bit to pop back and some other druid might want him after you are done.<br />
<br />
Most of all LEAVE the treasure chests alone and avoid the dining room. Bit and Byte are PITA's as well and def not worth the hassle.<br />
You can get a DC pet everywhere except AIW4 which I just use the summon/root method since they don't hit very hard.<br />

<br />
Best exp at your level would like mentioned, probly be in the maze underneath the castle.<br />
<br />
I recommand killing Dinner, then finding the Garden for your deck, so you can make Flowers.  The Black and Green flowers are both better then our normal resists buffs, even if its only by 5 or 10 points.<br />
<br />
Most of the zone is animal based, amazingly.  Becuase of this, they can be charmed.  Call of Karana works on most of the zone, but you'll need Command of Tunare for the back part of Alice.<br />
<br />
The Monkeys summon - always, they drop a libary card which you can use to make Words after getting the container from the libarian.<br />
<br />
The chests are a pain, they spawn halfings to assist them.<br />
<br />
Exodus is god here, it lets you try stuff out and still be semi safe about it.  Unless one of your clerics is bound here with you, I don't recommand dying, as rezzes are kinda hard to come by.  So you'll probly end up eatting the death.<br />
<br />
I personally don't have Dire Charm, but am working on it, and looking forward to using it in this zone.<br />
<br />
If your looking to do the Tunare Ring quest, I would recommand a group for the Unicorn.<br />
<br />
Been bound here personally for 8 months now, and I love it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Onetree Tallbarque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a PoM FAQ. It's rather old but so are the nerfs to the zone. You'll find the link in my sig.<br />
<br />
Keep any page corners you find. You can eventually make Funny Money (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=9504) out of them, which are then turned into gift boxes (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=9508) which produce dolls (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=29655) which can be used to make class armors (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=9630) (but not for melee except monk).<br />
<br />
Oh and congratulate yourself if you get a throne since you have about as much chance of that as being hit by a meteorite. :/<br />
<br />
Enjoy PoM for the novelty while it lasts. I've been bound there for 26 months straight. The zone has such potential for fun. Too bad it's been wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the input everyone. Onetree, I have definitely been reading the FAQ you keep. Thanks for that. <br />
<br />
I'm a LOOOONG way from Dire Charm, so messing with summoning stuff is out of the question for now. We do have a cleric bound up here, though who knows how long everyone will stay. I fished up a king cod card and got my first box. I have a library card to get another. Is that the box you can use to make Funny Money? I'm already getting bits of the Words of Wealth. <br />
<br />
Yeah I know that some of the Quest Armor cards are excessively rare. A few of the druid pieces would be nice upgrades for me though, and since I don't raid much, being able to do some questing for upgrades could be useful. Mostly it's nice being somewhere so different and so quiet. Well, quiet except for the maniacal laughter that wells up now and then...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KnightWard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Use the Book of Mischief to make Words of Wealth, trade the Words of Welth to Bob the Painter for a Empty Pot of Gold<br />
<br />
Empty pot of gold is the container used to make Funny Money</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Onetree Tallbarque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You don't really need the Deck of Spontaneous Generation anymore, and it's very easy to get another by fishing or killing Dinner for the king cod card. I kept a Book of Wealth (to make Words of Weath) and Empty Pot of Gold (to make Funny Money and other things).<br />
<br />
Btw, the &quot;new&quot; technique for making a Funny Money is to make a Words of Wealth in the Book first, then combine the WoW with a Top Right page corner in the Empty Pot of Gold.<br />
<br />
You give 4 Funny Moneys to Peaches for a Gift Box (random color), but sometimes you get a booby prize and sometimes you get absolutely nothing (what a rip!).<br />
<br />
If you don't raid much and you can convince a cleric and others to hang around PoM then PoM armor is feasible, if remotely. Too bad exp sucks big greens ones, though. SOE &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; needs to get on the ball and update this zone ASAP. /tap SOE<br />
<br />
DC is not a requirement in PoM. I've never used it there. I've charmed the first Grink before, but that is very risky solo and you get diddly-squat 29 times out of 30 so why bother. I used to solo AiW4 back when I was lvl 60 using the root/rot/run technique. It's risky, too, but more reliable. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Have been root-dotting the mushroom people in the forest; they're mostly light blue at my level, but they drop squires so I thought I'd kill them while I still get some exp. Easy peasy mobs, pretty high HP but no resistance at all. I heard they cast a poison dot, but it must be pretty short range cause from my own root-dot range they never cast. You just have to be sure to clear the pansies first while invis so they despawn. <br />
<br />
They drop plat and occasional items (got a platinum bar off one last night), along with squire cards. And I got a tasty candy and a lore super sweet fishing grub last night. Kind of odd, but I can't find any particular use for them, so I guess they're joke items. <br />
<br />
Killed the bixie too, which was also light blue. Can't bring myself to kill the halfling girl, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&lt;a href=&quot;http://planeofmischief.com&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Plane of Mischief&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Great guide with pics and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well the forest is way easy, plus most often light blue. So I moved on into the rat maze, at least when I can find my way down there (the maps show a buttload of maze traps but for some reason most of them don't seem to get me anywhere). <br />
<br />
Maze is definitely trickier, with occasional wandering adds on top of the high HP mobs. All are dark blue at 58 though, plus not much MR just like the forest, so root/rot goes easy. Teeny little passages, kind of like Guk only drier. Not much room to manuver, but a nice change from the forest. I'm still having fun here, and hope to keep on doing so, at least until the &quot;upgrade&quot;, which sounds like it will make the zone much worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Koldriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is there any way to get to this zone besides going through NToV? and if not is there any way that I could get through there to get to PoM without dying..do they see invis?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kytelae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Some bards have made the run with Selos and a DA item. But beyond that, you pretty much have to have a guild that can clear NTOV, or follow behind a guild which has cleared it. NTOV is full of big nasties, and yes they see invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Emelia Sunheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can easily run to PoM without a raid.. I've done it twice, once with my druid and once with my chanter.  Just get an Earring of the Frozen Skull (4 charges of 1sec-cast Divine Aura, from 10th ring war, or buy in bazaar for ~4kpp), run invis to Aary's spawn point, and cast DA and run.  Just SoW was fine; you don't need Selo's at all, although I'm sure it would help significantly. Having at least dubious Claws of Veeshan faction will help tremendously.  I used 3 charges of DA when I ran my druid (first run), and only 2 charges with my chanter (after i ran the druid there).  I never took *any* damage... just run ahead until you're far enough away from any mob to cast a 1 sec cast time spell.  If you find yourself in trouble and can't channel that, Exodus.<br />
<br />
BE SURE you know the exact way to PoM entrance.  My guild raided NToV a lot about a year ago, so I still knew the layout pretty well, but I still looked at some maps.  Getting lost and/or DT'd by the Vulak`Aerr script is not good.  Also, I've heard people say the zone-in looks like a miniature house or something - but I've never ever seen that.  It looks like a small dot on the ground in the corner to me on this computer and my second computer, so I have no idea what happened.</div></div><hr />
