<br />
PoP-PoN Maze, PoI dragon, Grummus (and spider), all BoT tower bosses<br />
Luclin- Grieg, Rumblecrush, Doomshade<br />
OoW- Shadowhunter (beastlord and druid duo)<br />
<br />
Beastlord is about 15200 hp buffed<br />
Druid is 10k hp/mana buffed<br />
Rogue is 14k hp<br />
<br />
all characters have 300+ AAs with the rogue and beastie having 700+<br />
all characters have epic 2.0 already<br />
<br />
We aren't looking for gear or flags or keys.... we just want to have some fun and kill big things with names that aren't a kyv hunter_01 or such.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

PoTactics vallon / tallon?<br />
Nobles - Slavedriver Menlo?<br />
kyv_hunter_02 ?<br />
 <br />
Have you thought about Mshas?<br />
And I know it would take forever, but some Vex Thal stuff might be doable?<br />
Or Seru? if he's ever up...</div></div><hr />

Do you think I can remember their names?  Newp!  But they're by the arena, there are PHs inside, and 2-3 different nameds pop. They are undead.  <br />
<br />
Also when you clear it, inside the arena is a tunnel that leads underwater, we found a High Priest Whosisface in there, dropped a really nice blunt weapon as I recall.</div></div><hr />

PoTime I think we figured out was 1 groupable... but we need an actual tank for agro control and multiple spawns...<br />
<br />
Tallon would be ok I guess but we would have slack ranged dps...<br />
<br />
Vallon we would need a puller<br />
<br />
we can do Illsalin named np... we were just looking at old raid mobs mostly we don't want to grind and camp named<br />
<br />
VT clear would be soooo slack (thinking like 24 hours to clear with 3)... but we got CoHed once and did blob 1 with just us 3<br />
<br />
Mshas druid isn't Qvic flagged.<br />
<br />
I think we need to recruit a puller and a tank and one more dps and go to PoP with a vengeance.<br />
<br />
What is the minimum number to clear NToV/ ST?<br />
Thanks for the ideas so far.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
You should give ST a try...<br />
 <br />
NToV I don't know.. you can get very large pulls there and that's not very fun. I'm a ToV newbie tho.</div></div><hr />

Gonna tackle NToV next</div></div><hr />

Most things that come to mind would require a puller and/or mez and/or cleric CH.<br />
 <br />
--<br />
 <br />
Seru would be near impossible with that group.  He only slows with shaman DR slow.  Even if the druid could heal with just reptile and KR, the fight would take 45+ mins, and he'ld for sure be oom (keep in mind can't use horse too.) Bane weapons = suck, necro dots = good, cleric ch = good<br />
 <br />
VT? I doubt you guys could trio every named in there. <br />
 <br />
Mshas? that aint gonna happen without more healing power, or a high AC plate tank and 5 more melee dps classes.<br />
 <br />

This isn't directed to anyone here, but I've seen such threads come up on other boards.  I always find the stories these bring up to be humorous.  People claim some crazy stuff.  Fishing stories =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't remember but one was really really rough.<br />
<br />
Creator and High Priest we did with 5....  High Priest being the most fun I have ever had in EQ with 5 people.... shaman tanking adds is great.<br />
<br />
I don't remember THO but we were thinking about trying the burrower in the Deep we figure we could prolly just Vines and dps all the little ones.... druid should be able to hang with that. Anyone done IV with 3 ish?<br />
<br />
Also planning on Clearing PoSky hopefully DTs won't end our fun too fast. <br />
<br />
Grieg down.... really dumb fight with that little people... snare + knockback is no bueno</div></div><hr />

<br />
M'shas aren't that bad at all, but yeah, more'n likely need a plate tank.  Can be done with one healer just hitting their cheal with a decent tank and slowage.   I've had a lot of fun tearing them up lately.<br />
<br />
The downside is that with just one group it's about a 15-20 minute kill. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
