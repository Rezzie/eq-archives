 <br />
That said, the best kiting experience that I recall around level 70 was the orc logger camp in Elddar Forest (just stay out of range of the nasty casters' AOE).  There is a kitable quest for a nifty ring from the Arch Druid in that zone.  Good hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your pet is the mob you want to die.<br />
<br />
Snare and glamour then charm pet, set it on next mob.<br />
<br />
Your charmed pet does not much damage (if doing mammoths in Icefall , your pet will do about 30% damage to the target mob before your pet is torn to shreds) while the mob tears up your pet.<br />
<br />
When your pet is at low health, use camo aa to break, then kill your ex pet for full xp.<br />
<br />
Get a new pet, send it against the mob you previously damaged.<br />
<br />
When your pet is low, break again and kill your pet.<br />
<br />
Agains, using mammoths as an example your original target mob should be at approx 30% helath by now, so your next pet and it will die approx together.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you get comfortable with this, you can add extra mobs to it - so your pet is being hit by 2, 3 or even more target mobs.<br />
Your pet will be roasted very quickly, and sometimes its a lottery between your speed of camo, lag, your internet connection etc as to whether you are quick enough to save your pet to kill, or whether it dies and you've wasted a mob.<br />
You will find your comfort zone with this.<br />
<br />
For me I find 2 or 3 is the most my conditions will allow for, then hitting camo at about 15% pet health results in a pet at 2-3% when it actually registers.</div></div><hr />

Don snare, Glamour of Tunare, 14 minute snare.  Repeat on up to 5 mobs for me.  Run to a safeish spot.<br />
<br />
Charm one, attack another.  All should attack your pet.  If not, run in tight circles until they hopefully do.  When your pet gets low (hp% I break charm at depends on how fast it's taking damage), hit invis AA.  Charm another, kill that last pet first, then another.  Rinse, repeat (though it's never nearly so pretty for me).  When you're starting to run out of mobs, re-14 min snare, and find more.<br />
<br />
14 min snare and Glamour of tunare are essential.  Not to mention being at about max casting distance when possible, or being moving always.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skel</div><div class="date">12-15-2007, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Other tips for charm kiting:<br />
<br />
1) If it's a matter of seconds, cycle your usual DoN chromatic snare and the AA Entrap. The AA operates off a separate timer so you can instantly retry another snare.<br />
<br />
2) Keep using Glamour of Tunare. Very very underused spell. It's an animal-specific debuff (-20 MR) that helps Charm spells land a little easier and it costs almost nothing to cast it (10m, w00t). Casting time of 1 second also means you can recast several times before a mob gets to you.<br />
<br />
3) If mammoths are tromping on you, practice the technique on something smaller. Charm kiting has a learning curve to it, and i STILL sometimes get smooshed. Try the snakes/lizards at the zone-in to Steppes from Mesa. Handy escape route, not terribly social, and they don't hit nearly as hard.<br />
<br />
Typically, especially if i'm feling rusty, i'll snare my intended pet (make sure it's along snare, you can overwrite Mire with Ensnare), debuff with Glamour, Haste it (clicky necklace), and park it a LONG WAY AWAY. Then i go get the next mob, snare it, and run it right into my pet, a LONG WAY AWAY. During the entire encounter, i try to keep myself at maximum spell-cast range (look into an ER item, like Ring of the Seasong). That way when/if charm breaks, i'm kiting distance away and they're both snared and debuffed, ready to be recharmed.<br />
<br />
Keep at it, like i said there's a learning curve to this technique but it's extremely useful in any zone with animals (and later, insects). Don't rush things by trying to take too many mobs at once or squeezing into a tiny space. Keep it open like you're kiting long-range.<br />
<br />
As far as only having 43 AAs, no worries. Get your Innate Camo and preferably Entrap (1st rank will work fine) and you should be able to charm kite.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
PS - after Ensnare lands the first time, it's good for 14 minutes, no need to recast it after every other spell. Same goes for Glamour. Once the mob is charmed, there's no sense in continuing to debuff it.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Lots of room along the back wall near zone in from Sunder.  All griffs are of a level to charm.<br />
 <br />
I pull (ONE MOB - paci if needed) with serpent vines.  It's never resisted, then run around til I get glamour on mob AND ensnare.  Ensnare is a low level snare, so may be resisted, but it lasts like 20mins with focus effects. Once ensnared and glamoured I charm grif, and go get another griffin..again pulling with serpent vines.  Sick pet on this mob and while the two are fighting you have ample time to put ensnare and glamour on mob your pet is fighting.  When pets health get down below 10% break charm - yes with innate invis - get it.  Now charm the one your pet was just fighting, he's already ensnared and glamoured so it should take easily.  Sick freshly charmed pet on old pet that is almost dead, then go get another griff.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Charming basics....<br />
 - always keep everything SNARED<br />
 - be prepared for charm to break; they will break!<br />
 - always stay at max distance<br />
 - pet will always take damage at faster pace than mob it's fighting<br />
 <br />
I'd suggest practising on the Baselisks in Sundersky right in from the Goru zl.  They're still DB at 74, but easy to manage, lots of space and a quick escape with the zone line right there.<br />
 <br />
Once you're comfortable with charming, you can use a charmed pet to tank summoning named mobs.   Just get them dead quick and stay at max range.  Be ready to be summoned if charm breaks.  There's some risk to this eh, but I've done it successfully many times.</div></div><hr />

Be careful though... if charm breaks and the pet gets to you it's gonna rip you a few new ones. Snare is extra important, heh. If charm doesn't break until my pet is almost dead I click off savage spirit before I invis, just to be safe.</div></div><hr />

Just Harmony the mobs and pull singles or pull with snare - Egress - and when you get back the one snared should be far enough away from the others to single. The only problem with these missions is you have to have a minimum of 3 people in your group to get them. Sometimes you can find people to join you for the mission who don't actually participate with you, just are in group/mission for you to be able to get the mission.<br />
 <br />
The DoDH missions are level based as well, meaning you have to have a certain base level to get the mission. I can't remember now - but I think the average has to be 70 or around there.<br />
 <br />
I also agree with the poster who suggested getting serpent vines - very rarely every resisted and it is fairly long lasting. I rarely solo any more, but when I do I have found the animals (tigers and raptors) on raptor island in the Buried Sea to be easy to root/rot.<br />
 <br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
answer, The few times i have tried to work with in the generic understanding i have of pet kiting, is i stay far enough out that i can keep the non charmed in range.<br />
i do have a newer idea i want to play with on wedesday for this pet kiting, as it may help me to manage this better,<br />
<br />
the mobs i have been using are snow leopards in icefall.<br />
<br />
but my modifed new strat is gonna be pretty simple<br />
<br />
<br />
Snare, Glamour, Root, charm, go get new mob, snare, glamour, root it next to rooted pet. sick pet. since both are snared and rooted, if need be i have a few extra seconds of live time to handle this<br />
<br />
as one is near death, click invis potion, unclick it, and charm the healthier mob<br />
<br />
sounds a bit tougher but it may work better for me with the extra security blanket</div></div><hr />

Everything there including the crocs likes us Druids, Crocs will add if you run over the top of em and stop to say hi, but other then that its open, by the sea and easy xp. <br />
<br />
For lower levels Direwild Wolfies just by the druid port in. Some either side of the cave, do one side then the other, invis through the cave and leave the named alone. They run fast and hit hard so good snare essential but they are well spread so you can easily pull em one at a time. Just work 2 to start then add inthe 3rd when you feel confident. <br />
<br />
Biggest bit of advice to would be charm kiters is if snare breaks turn around and run, don't walk backwards to get away, turn around and run. The number of times I have seen peeps just walk backwards getting stomped is amazing. You don't have to constaly watch the mobs, when you need room to cast a spell due to being close and charm broke, turn around and run away till you have room, walking backwards is a real bad habbit to develop. Keep in mind that exposing your back to mobs up close is not part of the plan though :)<br />
<br />
Also use external view, mouse wheel scroll out and you can judge the distances heaps better, plus you can see whats behind ya all the time, I like it but thats just me. <br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

Also casting glamor on the pet is essential for charm not to break.Yes, the higher your Cha the better your charm will hold.  Get a cha buff from a chanter.  Better yet, if you can go charm hunting with a chanty.  They can tash your pet and it will likely stay charmed the full duration of the spell.<br />
 <br />
At any rate, if no chanter, be sure to use your 'glamour' debuff to help charm hold.<br />
 <br />
BUT, always be ready for charm to break.   If you're ready you'll be at max range and can re-charm.<br />
 <br />
I did the meat quest on deadbone island in TBS the other day with a chanty.   With his charmed skelly, my charmed thulli, and chanties slow, we cleared the full length of the beach in minutes...was fun. :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

You do notice a difference with spells that have a neg MR component, and also with a glamor/tash, so the only benefits I can feel you can tangibly get with charisma in EQ, is vendor costs and probability of aggro on a failed Lull (used to be 50/50 on a fail whether I'd aggro the mob, now I can chain lull and get fail after fail and it would be really unlikely to aggro a mob even if I'm doing it deliberately!  This is anecdotal though, and I haven't tested lulls after taking all gear off to see if base cha is more likely to aggro or not).</div></div><hr />

No clue as to it's effect on charm though - they preach it heavily, same on eqdiva, but without numbers that I could find.<br />
<br />
I'll try it out and &quot;report&quot; my findings.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy occasionally doing the pet charm/kiting in icefall but sometimes its a bit to hectic for me, Sadly my kiting grounds in TBS have gone lightblue to me at lvl 74, I have had mild success with atiki, but honestly, i have found it rough because of the fact that atiki is an indoor zone, and you can not soe, harmony the mobs. I would appreciate some additional suggestions. also have seen that mammoths are a bit over camped on luclin when i try to do them, mainly i keep running into Khauruk.</div></div><hr />

[pedantic derail]AC has no cap - just a point of decreasing returns.  Most classes who would worry about AC get good enough returns to make more AC always useful (in theory at least...I still think beastlords have a bug for their mitigation and agro both).  And SoF has made even sickeningly high levels of AC (5k+) very useful.[/pedantic derail]<br />

I was charming for Lesson again last night, with a jump to 282CHA.  I didn't notice a real increase in duration of charm, but I did get 2 more AAs out of the 1/2 hour vs. last time - up to 8AAs now (and maxed healing adept line yay!).  And, I wasted a good bit of time being stupid during the duration of lesson.<br />
<br />
Also, Hycotti hasn't run into me there in weeks if ever - nice try though! :).  I'd suggest you move to the far side of suncrest next, the side by the cinderscale drakes.  One kiteable named there drops an ranged that might upgrade you (scroll of suncrest or similar name).  I never liked Atiiki - HPs feel really high to me.  Maybe that's just because I hate the zone.<br />
<br />
If you do find yourself in Icefall again, 74's a handy level.  White cons will be charmable, and anything yellow or above will not.</div></div><hr />

Also pick up the Rebuilding-Clay task from one of the elves near the port west of the beach (or the SW corner of zone).  This requires you to loot 10 mounds of mud.  After about 30ish gators you should have this, and this is decent exp + faction towards Fang Breakers (78 spell SotF and 79 spell Reptile are available with work on this faciton).  I get about 2% of a level for 4-5 mobs at level 78.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll have to test it again, but I experimented with this at lvl 71, and it proved untrue - for AA at least.  I don't see why there would be a different mechanic otherwise.<br />
<br />
That means though that I should be getting &gt;30% AA per mob at 76 then if I do the killshot?  I've never heard of red mobs even giving that much xp (and I'm killing yellows).  Assuming 50% xp loss, with lesson and an xp pot, I would then be gettin an AA per each kill w/ what I solo nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I have tested it on the worgs in Loping Plains. I am not sure how much it is, but I am certain I don't get a big chunk of the exp I do with no pet. If you have a charmed pet when you kill a mob the % exp loss is also determined by how much damage you did vs your pet.</div></div><hr />

Next I set the chimera fully buffed and ds'd on a feran, with nukes and dots I took it down easy. Chimera was at 20% but when charm broke Chimera summoned me and again I had to exodus to escape. So I think thats the end of my soloing in WoS. Summoning Mobs just dont see the joke.  :(</div></div><hr />
