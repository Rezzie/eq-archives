I certainly do, and really missed it when the wolf form MGB was &quot;fixed&quot; to not work anymore.<br />

Well, there's good news to be had. It might have been changed beforehand, or they may have skipped the LDoN Feral Pack indoors-only spell. But for the first time in a very long time, I was extremely happy to see the mass-doggies come out and play again! :dance: <br />
 <br />
&lt;/IMG&gt;&lt;/IMG&gt;<br />
Btw, for all you dr00d-players out there. It is VERY bad form to MGB and cast non-essential buffs without checking with a Raid leader first. Luckily I joked about it in raid-say first, then got a tell from the raid leader to &quot;Do it!! &quot;. I sent back that this was nerfed a while ago, but for the heck of it decided to hit MGB and Feral Pack... and lo and behold, ...<br />

<br />
be a little careful tho. there are stacking issues. think champion is one, not sure what else.<br />
<br />
p.s.: another fun one to do to your guildes on a wipe in guild lobby is to tl em. see if they pay attention and tell the diff between a tl box and a rez box.</div></div><hr />
