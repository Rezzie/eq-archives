<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lilnukerbuddy Barkeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there anything better a level 49 druid  could get besides a othmir cap? mainly focus on wisdom.and the picture is  just for looks wish i actualy had my epic they dident have a soulstripper  so i put that there instead</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faedia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look for a Bellows Crafted Cap. The WIS isn't higher, but I recommend it because of the raw HP and mana benefit. They drop like candy in Plane of Innovation, so they're usually really cheap in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
It does have a &quot;Recommended level 50&quot; on it, but you're only one level away anyway. :p  <br />
<br />
Edit: There's also the Elysian Crown, it drops in Umbral Plains off &quot;disturbed elysian remains.&quot; It has more WIS than both the Othmir and Bellows caps. You can solo them in a few levels, but usually Druids will shout if something dropped that they don't need. Elysian armor rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, depending where you are with faction in Velious (and how much help you can get from friends/guildmates), you could work on a Circlet of the Falinkan.  That'll last you quite a while.</div></div><hr />

SV MAGIC: +15<br />
Required level of 46.<br />

<br />
Nice stats, great focus, and decent saves.  No HP, but that's minor to me given what else it provides.  Even after getting MP4 I'll have a hard time replacing it (though others probably wouldn't... hehe).  Crafted from planar drops, but tradeable.<br />
