I am a Pally here... but a Guild Leader on Cazic Server and one of my druids is looking to do his 1.5 and I am told that he is stuck and cannot continue in the 1.5 quest because he is KoS to Arcane Scientists.<br />
 <br />
Has any other druid run into this? Thanks for the help.<br />

 <br />
If so, what did he kill to get that way?<br />

More information is needed.<br />

I know that he is KoS. I will ask him later tonight when I talk to him to see if he even knows what has gotten him so low on the faction table.<br />
 <br />
I am also KoS to said Arcane Scientists and I can tell you that back in the older times of farming Hadden for that earring, Rephas who sits on the banks of the lake in Qeynos Hills was who I killed repeatedly to keep my busy. This is what made me KoS. This could have been what he killed. <br />
 <br />
According to Alla's there are no mobs that can be killed to raise the faction and each of the quests to be done to raise the faction require interaction between said quester and one of the members or associates of the Arcane Scientists. Thus someone who is KoS would be stuck. He has said that he has tried charm/mez/illusions to do the quest turn ins and none have worked. <br />

Thanks for the help so far.<br />

 <br />
If the mob is green, and thus won't aggro, you can open a trade window with them, and have someone invis you (while trade window is open), then hit trade.<br />
