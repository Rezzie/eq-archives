I'm curious about a few things.  What builds are most common/viable for PvP?  I like Feral from past experience but I hear Moonkin is getting some notice recently.  I would prefer a build that would do well in mostly PvP but still hold its own in PvE (tanking or healing, depending on the builds I end up testing).<br />
<br />
If anyone can post a few links to the more common builds at least it would give me something to start thinking about before I get to 70.</div></div><hr />

This results in some interesting problems for the feral spec.  Being required to be in melee range, the feral druid will often find himself continually slowed or snared.  Yes, you can continually shift, but then you're oom and a person is beating on you the whole time.  Chances are, you will die without dealing very much melee damage.<br />
<br />
Moonkin, on the other hand, has instant damage from quite a range.  They don't need to be in melee range to be effective.  As a result, I find moonkin druids to be 'easier' to play in an arena.  Also, a moonkin druid doesn't need to be in moonkin form to deal damage.  A feral druid does.</div></div><hr />

If you like resto, you'll do fine in arena.  My spec is a hybrid of sorts right now with 21 points in Balance (down to Nature's Grace) and the rest in Resto.  I can heal very well and still do damage when the others are either dead or incapacitated.  I still main heal in PvE but I have to watch aggro more because I lost a few points in the aggro reduction talents.  Tree form is gone too.  But PvP is my main source of fun so....</div></div><hr />

That may be the case in the low ranking teams, but everything I have seen indicates it's far from the truth at the the top rankings. There's a reason druids are the least represented class in the top arena teams...<br />
<br />
Breakdown by class of last week's top 20 5v5 teams from every battlegroup:<br />
 <br />
 Warrior Total: 198 -- (20%) <br />
 Paladin Total: 189 -- (19%) <br />
 Priest Total: 137 -- (14%) <br />
 Mage Total: 121 -- (12%) <br />
 Shaman Total: 108 -- (11%) <br />
 Warlock Total: 84 -- (8%) <br />
 Hunter Total: 78 -- (8%) <br />
 Rogue Total: 46 -- (5%) <br />
 Druid Total: 40 -- (4%) <br />

If anyone wants to see a firsthand analysis from one of the top druid arena PvPers on why the druid class is not wanted for top teams, here's a good post: Comprehensive Druid analysis for nonbelievers (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=102900614&amp;sid=1)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">05-10-2007, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True. But the breakdown of druid specs from those in the top 20 teams is:<br />
<br />
- Balance: 4<br />
- Feral: 17<br />
- Restoration: 19<br />
<br />
While not as well represented as resto, not too far off. But balance specs, what a telling number that is. No matter how you look at it, if druids were as powerful as the vocal minority would have you believe, they would have been power-leveled instead of all the belf pallys. Regardless of the spec, the numbers don't lie: druids are massively under-powered for all 3 arena team formats (rogues and hunters are right there with us).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but I don't feel bad for them... the shred me every time in the arena.  I don't fear the warrior... I fear that damned hunter who rips me a new one every damned time.....</div></div><hr />
