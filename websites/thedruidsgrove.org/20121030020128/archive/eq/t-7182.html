I see where I can put training points into each area, 5 I think. What happens if I do train in all of them? If I do only 1, what happens if I want to change. How do I stop 1 specialization and start a different 1? Some please explain so I know what's what. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, there are the basic spell skills: i.e., Alteration, Evocation, etc.  These go up naturally as you cast spells of that type.  They are capped by level.  Don't worry about spending any points on these.<br />
<br />
Second, there are the specializations for each basic spell skill.   When you can, buy each one by putting one point in each.   These also go up naturally as you cast spells.   The first specialization to go beyond 50 is your &quot;superspecialty,&quot; and will go to 200 (again, just by casting).  Note that you cannot go beyond 50 in any specialization UNLESS you have put at least a point into ALL specializations (i.e., you have purchased all specializations).<br />
<br />
To ensure that the specialization you want goes beyond 50, just cast spells of that type repeatedly until it hits 51.  <br />
<br />
An alternative strategy is to buy the one you want to go beyond 50 only, play normally, then when that one hits 49 or 50, go put a point in the other ones.  Then just cast spells of the desired type until the first hits 51.<br />
<br />
There is a quest to change your superspecialty.  You can find information about that here on the board.  It resets everything to 50, I believe.<br />
<br />
The Secondary Forte AA permits one other specialization to go beyond 50.  The first one to go beyond 50 (from normal casting) will be your secondary specialization.</div></div><hr />

The specialization ones were the one's I asking about...for Druids I see where Evocation is probaly the best (I'm not a healer, nuke/rot mainly). Anyone have thoughts on this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Specing saves you mana and supposedly reduced fizzle rates.<br />
<br />
I think last time there was a poll, druids came out about 50/50 on evo vs alter, so its up to you.<br />
<br />
I always stayed Evo, although there are very good reasons for raid druids to go Alter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karanthal</div><div class="date">04-06-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are good cases for both Alte and Evoc, and IMO Conj to a slightles lesser extent.<br />
<br />
Alte = Heal<br />
Evoc = DD<br />
Conj - DoT<br />
<br />
Your specialisation should match what you do most, or where you feel you will get the biggest gains.<br />
<br />
While I heal a lot on raids, probably more than I nuke, I very rarely run oom on a raid.  DD kiting while solo I need all the mana I can get to keep up with the evil necros soloing in PoF.<br />
<br />
We do use druids quite often in CH rotations, Alte would help me out a lot here, but I figure as I can last for a Xegony kill on ch rotation I can get by most situations without changing.</div></div><hr />

alteration  = heal, snare, root, port, evac, str buff, regen(if you don't have a clicky)<br />
nuke = nuke , firefist (woohoo) some of our fire dots I believe<br />
conjure.. swarm line dots.. summon food (yay) boo boo...<br />
<br />
just a clarification...<br />
<br />
alteration covers more spells that we use routinely (generalization)<br />
evocation covers our dmg element ..very useful...just depends on what you find yourself doing... to me.. if you have elemental/ornate gloves... alteration spec is great... since you're saving mana on summer's flame ( the same way you would with spec) and then you can save mana on heals and such as well via spec.granted you could spec evoc and let the ornate/ele gloves add even more savings.. but for balance I like the first idea.</div></div><hr />

I play solo most of the time, though I will group if I have enough time when logged in. I don't see me ever belonging to a hardcore raid guild, no time for it. And WoW is probably going to make a big impact on how far I go in this game, so Evoc is my current choice...Root/Rot/DD to finish, rinse repeat (I hate that saying but I see it everywhere...lol).</div></div><hr />
