New player (to WoW), new druid, and new to the forums.  First I'd like to say that I love the druid community and this site rocks for class-specific info and discussion.<br />
<br />
Now that I've got my butt-kissing done ;), I wanted to ask at what level it's not worth trying to get the Fang gear that drops from the Wailing Caverns instance?  Currently I'm at 23 about to ding 24, and I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to get full set since I may be outleveling it soon.  I've done several runs, and so far have 3/5 pieces with only the belt :mad: and the leggings left to get.  I don't mind the runs as the green drops are pretty decent and I can skin medium hides pretty regularly from the raptors.<br />
<br />
I know I should be doing RFK pretty soon, if not already, but being so close, yet so far from getting the set rakes on my nerves.  Any advice?  Thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm on Azshara-H and always looking for a good group, if anyone's interested.  One thing that I'd love is an all-druid party - I mean, what else do you need when everyone in the group can do it all? :cool:</div></div><hr />

leveling is most of the time so fast that re doing an instance at low lvl to get an item is not worth the time spent.<br />
unless you decide to make a twink<br />
think i even used sm items in my late 50's with my druid.<br />
I would just use what drops when you are grinding or buy stuff at ah</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">10-27-2006, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually had full fang up until level 30. Well, not -full- fang... Moss cinch was better than the fang belt.. which took a bloody 30 runs to get, gr.<br />
<br />
It's up to you if you want it or not. The leggings are the best piece of the set, and they should have a decent drop rate. The belt isn't so good, though, and has a low drop rate. If you want to spend the time to get the leggings, go for it. If not, well it's not like there's not other gear out there.<br />
<br />
I will say, though, that the leggings lasted me longer than the rest of the set. I believe I was still wearing them around level 33 or so, before I got the Gnomer reward pants.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkelf</div><div class="date">10-28-2006, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont bother yourself with low lvl sets cause most of them are really big crap . If you are skinner and leatherworker make some good items and/or just do the instances and get custom gear .<br />
<br />
Most of the guys ( including ) 60s are getting custom gear . For example on my main I have Feralheart set , Tier 1/2/3 and some other items so I combine them ( deppends on what I/we are doing ) . You will waste a lot of time for that set and anyway soon you will start looking for new gear . <br />
<br />
Get custom items , check ah , make something and thats it .</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to the Embrace of the Viper set... stop calling my house, I don't want you anymore, you tease. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWK</div><div class="date">10-31-2006, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On JWK, I had the full fang set until the mid-30s with full Enchants on all the pieces (I still break it out in IF now and then).  ON Stagnant, I didn't bother.  Instead, I looked for &quot;of the tiger&quot; and most recently &quot;of the gorilla&quot;.<br />
<br />
On Stagnant, I went a pure feral build and wanted as much STR as I could, but I started to notice that my Mana Pool was being consumed shapeshifting, so i added in some Gorilla pieces to help out.  I didn't lose that much crit from losing old Tiger pieces, but gained enough mana to overcome shifting issues.</div></div><hr />
