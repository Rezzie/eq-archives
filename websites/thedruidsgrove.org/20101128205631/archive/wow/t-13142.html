<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimjonn</div><div class="date">01-06-2009, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is hit rating so hard to come by in WotLK? And why do emblem of heroism rewards suck so badly?<br />
<br />
My guild has loads of warriors so I'm specced pure kitty. I have no T7 gear but I'm pretty well equipped: 7800 AP and 48% crit chance raid buffed, and I do 20% of the damage on a Naxx run. However my hit rating is only 177, which I'm sure is hurting me on boss fights. <br />
<br />
For hit gear I have the Crystal-Infused Tunic (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37165), the Gored Hide Legguards (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37644) and the Boots of the Neverending Path (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44297). Anything I'm missing that isn't a raid drop?<br />
<br />
I've got 105 emblems saved up and could easily buy the Heroes' Dreamwalker Raiments (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39554) but it's only a slight upgrade over the Darkheart Chestguard (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44303) and neither of those have hit rating.<br />
<br />
Okay I'm done whining. I hate patch days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-06-2009, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ironically, it seems all of the + hit on good gear, is available only from T7.5 raiding.  I wish I had a good explanation why.<br />
<br />
Emblem gear is meant to suck.  Blizz suggested that this would be the case, in order to leave room for growth with the release of new raid etc.  They will be adding to the badge vendor loot slowly as they release new content (kind of like the Sunwell Isle badge vendor).   Blizz made the mistake of making the first badge gear on par with end game raid gear, and that made end game raiding less important.  Currently Naxx/Mag is the top raid, so badge gear is equal to enterance level gear for those raids (it is).  The reason the gear seems so inferior atm is because Heroic Loot is on par with it. (as heroic loot is also set to be entry level raid gear for Naxx)  <br />
<br />
Take note of your recount data, I don't think we are currently missing as much as the EJ nerds have projected us to.  My kitty has very low hit (I am Bear primarily) and unbuffed my kitty has like 110 hit or somthing.  With buffs (Extreme Snapper + Flask of Accuracy = +85 hit, I am around 200.  On the Heigan fight in Naxx-10, I missed .78% according to recount.  That is less than the 1% that is standard with hit cap.  <br />
<br />
My point, just do your best with flasks and food and I think you will be ok.    <br />
<br />
Also, if you are seeing a large % of miss, you can re-gem to +hit.  +16 hit gems are quite inexpensive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice timing on this post coming up, I'm currently debating over whether to spend enchant slots on AP/agility or Hit rating (also like armor pen too on occasion). Think i got 140 hit right now, and yet with heroic presence up in raids i miss like 1.5% according to recount. I'm still a tank at heart so I'm not as read up on hit rating value. On Patchwork I pulled 3.4k the other day so a 1.5% increase would be atleast...50dps? unless its more of a exponential curve. Also recount also has alot of my auto attacks listed as glancing, is this where the huge increase comes?</div></div><hr />

I think im having trouble to get to 3.4k DPS.<br />
<br />
Are u able to maintaine &quot;Savage Roar&quot; and &quot;Rip&quot; with a FB in between them? Im never able to do that with my current built.<br />
<br />
But i dont have &quot;Master Shapeshifter&quot; and also not have <br />
&quot;Predatory Instincts&quot; and &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;.<br />
<br />
These are pure DPS-talents which i miss.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if these talents can boost me to the point where i can have a SR, RIP, FB rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: sry for my chaotic writing. Im at work and dont have a clear head^^</div></div><hr />

FYI, With 1 Billion hit rating, you will still have a 1% chance to miss.  You cannot gear to hit 100% of the time.  There will always be at least a 1% chance to miss.  Now, in practice, you may miss more/less than that, but the game mechanics are designed to cap out at 99% chance to hit.  So you are looking at 3400 DPS x 1.005 (.5%) = 3417.  So an increase of ~17 DPS.  Any increase in DPS is a good thing, but weight the increase appropriatley.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is possible to completely negate melee and ranged melee miss. There is, however, a hard floor of 1% spell miss. <br />
This is, to the best of my knowledge, accurate.  I've seen no credible source contradicting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stand corrected.  I was under the impression, all attacks were subject to the 1% floor.  <br />
<br />
Doesn't it seem odd that they would apply it to one attack class and not the other?  Perhaps it is because spell can't be blocked/parried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">01-13-2009, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i checked on 1% miss floor, this was removed althogh i would still expect to see 1 or 2 misses per boss fight due to recount errors. <br />
<br />
Sergio--yeah I joined a new guild this month that has me 100% kitty specced. Their healers just heal thru ****ty spec if i do have to OT something, but they have too many tanks as is and don't need me for patchwork etc. yes your assumptions are correct, 16 points into resto for naturalist and master shapeshifter ooc. PI SA, kotj are all very necessary. <br />
<br />
***FYI. PI is highly recommended for tank spec too. 30% less aoe damage is nice. lots of bosses do frontal aoe cone spells etc. <br />
<br />
I'll repost a new kitty rotation thread on what i've found etc.</div></div><hr />
