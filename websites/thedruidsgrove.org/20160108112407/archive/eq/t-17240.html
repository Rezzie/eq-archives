<br />
I am an ex war/enc/cle/sha/shd/wiz/dru player from way back, with most of my experience being pre pop. I have played a bit in omens and god, and almost nothing in anything more recent. <br />
<br />
Predominantly, I am experienced in boxing, indoor cc, and all the trilogy zones. Not much I didn't do in those days (ahhh old school fear breaks :))<br />
<br />
I'm familiar with old school druid strats, snare kite, quad, root rot, (charming seen it but never got it). I'm a competant group member but far from familiar with group roles and spell sets these days.<br />
<br />
My druid is geared up with current bazaar kit, not top end, but faaaaar better than my old kit. (Focused on wis, mana hp then ac)<br />
<br />
Where can I hunt solo? The current hot zone for me is PoI, but I figure I am on the edge for solo there. SolB bats is my next option to try.<br />
<br />
So cutting to the choice, should I bother with SolB at all or is there a better place for fast exp for a 52 druid?<br />
<br />
Other suggestions are highly valued.<br />
<br />
What is the group role for dru's now? (Healer?)<br />
What are the key buff lines other than spikes, sow,chloro and skin like ....?<br />
What are the crucial aa's I should invest in?<br />
Shoud I level then AA these days or AA then level?<br />
Should I just get a merc tank and rip in in PoI?<br />
Are our pets still poop?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance......<br />
<br />

From reading this forum and others, I have managed to get a few key pieces of advice: <br />
<br />
1: With upgraded bazaar gear, you will do better than you think in PoI. 1a: Skip the warrior mercenary - I have done extremely will with a healer merc and playing the tank mage (DS potion stacks with druid ds, pull, dot, nuke away while the merc heals.)<br />
<br />
2: Grinding out AA along the way, seems to be the best idea. AA &gt; Level these days. If you get too high a level without any AA it's much more difficult to kill anything that gives you xp.</div></div><hr />

1) Same group role as before.  Healer usually in PUG's while DPS/Utility/Back up healer in groups with friends.  Nothing really has changed<br />
2) Wild Growth (Level 81+ spell) and Lion's Str line are the only ones I can think of that you didn't include.<br />
3) Their all crucial.  Focus on one line or focus on all of em.  In the end you need em all.<br />
4) For Druids, AA &gt; Level as we need many AA's to do either of our jobs reliably<br />
5) I would grab the Tank Merc.  Make sure its the Journeyman level one though.<br />
6) If by pets your referring to our lvl 55 one (Boo-Boo) then yup, he was a joke by Sony/Verant and nothing more.  We get a decent Swarm Pet and Charming seems to be where the Druid is heading for a class solo wise.<br />
 <br />
Extra info - <br />
AA level's.  55, 59, 62, or 65.  Most of our &quot;core&quot; AA's start at 55, the rest start at 59.  Also at 59 you can wear Elaborate Armour, very over powered vs. content you will most likely xp in.  62 Provides you with Charm so you can master that for later levels.  It is also possible to charm before this in PoDesease and Nightmare but I didn't personally.  At 65, I would stay here until you have ALL the AA's you think you will need.  66-70 can be skipped over and you can begin AA'ing at 74/75 again.  If you where able to get your spells in the 66-68 range.  Staying 71 to gain max AA xp per kill solo is advisable.<br />
Other things to consider.  You gain a nice snare at level 61 in DoN expansion.  At 61 you gain the ability to recieve the best Cleric, Chanty, and Shaman Buffs.  These will make your Merc vs. DB's godly :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

Kills will be very fast and non-stop. Gulf of Gunthak is good, lower Guk maybe good too (not sure about this one since I only PL'ed people here).<br />
 <br />
If you like to charm kite, go with PON werewolves once you reached level 53 (spell: glamour of tunare will greatly enhance charm success rate). This place is good in that you have multiple charm target (read: you can kill your pet and gain experience), not like other similar spots where only limited animals are available. Stay there till 58 when you get your percentage heal spell, then you can try other areas with only one fully buffed pet (skin, DS, regen, strength, pet haste), and use the percentage heal to keep it alive.</div></div><hr />
