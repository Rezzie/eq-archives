<br />
i finally gave up totally with the herbing for cards (as i posted elsewhere) and with the buying cards individually.<br />
<br />
last nite in a fit of major excess i spied the same 2 Noble Decks on our AH at a slighty reduced price than they had been at the weekend and i simply clicked 'buyout' :bubbrubb2 <br />
<br />
i hope i've not made a mistake cos making large amounts of gold takes a while even though i'm not short of a bob or 2 !<br />
<br />
i decided that given the inflating prices for cards of all types - especially the Ace (around 3k) i'd be better off buying the whole deck and then selling the 5 cards I have (2/3/5/6/8) on the AH an hopefully recouping 50% of the cost of the deck.<br />
<br />
if i can do this i'll be happy with the overall price i paid for the deck.<br />
<br />
i've put them all up for around the prices going, but slightly under everyone else at the time.<br />
<br />
although i understood they were random it does seem that since i've been looking the ones that are the rarest are :<br />
<br />
Ace<br />
Four<br />
Seven<br />
<br />
and the commonest ones I see for sale being the :<br />
<br />
Two<br />
Three<br />
Eight<br />
<br />
I still sorta think that as we close in the next Faire their values will go up a bit as people will then be wanting that last card or 2 in order to make the trinket and not 'miss' the Faire week.</div></div><hr />

NO!<br />
<br />
Even after getting all my gold back from my account getting hacked, I'm down to ~5K from montrous repair bills while my guild tries to get Naxx25 on farm status.<br />
<br />
so that's roughly 1/12 of the gold you have, right? ;)</div></div><hr />

made about 4400g for them.  1 more to sell. :)<br />

90 AGI will be superior in the future(patch 3.1) and is only slightly behind now.</div></div><hr />

I do like the Faire at Elywnn - such a quiet, quaint, sleepy little place.<br />
<br />
always nice run down there and mingle with all the low ally's.<br />
<br />
Took the AGI one and am loving it. seems to proc a lot. and that about of AGI is a seriously nice bonus to crit and dodge for me at my level of gear. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
:band: <br />
<br />
it finally let me get rid of some old green q reward trinket from levelling :p i really struggle trying to get good trinkets ?<br />
<br />
its definitely worth trying to get one esp if you are herby - i started off by herbing a lot and sending all my banked herbs to a friendly inscripter.<br />
<br />
this got me 3 Nobles cards. i know though its pure luck. in fact i got a 4th noble card but it was a duplicate - BUT it sold for 1000 gold :)<br />
<br />
i do have a reasonable amount of money so as mentioned i just caved in and spent circa 10k on a complete deck on the AH.  but i've sold the cards i had and i dont think so far i've lost out on the ones i paid for on the AH and since re-sold.<br />
<br />
i have one left to sell. i am hoping to sell it this week whilst the Faire is in town. i want 1k for a 6. trouble is there are 4 on AH last nite all around 950-1k gold. so by the time i sell all the cards i estimate the deck will have cost me circa 4k.  <br />
<br />
even I think that's a relative bargain - and i dont spend money easily, ask my guildy who laughs at me and always says 'its play money' or 'its not really money'.<br />
<br />
the amount of dodge and crit it was adding on a proc was awesome. in fact for those really high geared players it probably would not make such an impact ? as you have such high values for these stats anyway ?  for me it will help offset the lack of available gear.<br />
<br />
i'm just hoping for more BoE LW items in future patch. also more BoE items that filter out of 10/25 man raids.<br />
<br />
Oh talking of which i bought a set of : Gloves of Fast Reaction at the weekend to....they looked amazing versus my old blue ones and especially my old epic BC pvp ones !<br />
<br />
trouble was i could not find the gem i wanted and some JC's did not have or know where to get the pattern for a Shifting Twilght Opal, 8agi and 12 stam. so for now its got a red 16 agi in it so i lose the bonus :(  i need to decide on a better blue gem so i get the bonus.  maybe one with dodge or crit ?<br />
<br />
@poison : i've got eyes in the back of my furry head, and anti stealth abilities highly tuned against any sneaky thiefs :p</div></div><hr />

I think all blue socket friendly gems will have Stam/Spirit/MP5 as part of their itemization.  So your best bet is probably the 8agi/12stam if you don't want the pure agi gem at the cost of socket bonus.  (I am assuming the socket bonus is a useful stat?)</div></div><hr />

no one had the pattern for the 8agi/12stam nor knew where to get it :(<br />
<br />
once i can one i'll put it in over the 16agi as the socket bonus is 4agi so i only lose out on 4 agi and gain 12 stam.<br />

Or he saw your new trinket and was thinking:<br />
&quot;Oh crap, he has da DCG... he must be full i213 equipped, but maybe i have a chance of surviving if i give him free-loot!&quot; :D <br />
<br />
<br />
btw: im checking out all the ppl from time to time. Only by comparing my equip to others i get ideas of improvement. <br />
(makes me think like: &quot;why does he have this or that enchant/gem etc., could it be an improvement?&quot;)<br />
And then i go and look at the numbers.<br />
Or if i know that a player has less equip than i do, i can give better tipps if i know where he is with his equip. :dance:</div></div><hr />

yeah good idea s3R, i should do a bit of that but time does not allow it and I guess i feel a lot of the time i'm going to be looking at people who have items i can't get.<br />
<br />
i just need to get geared for heroics - via some normals or easier heroics and then progress to the harder ones.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry. <br />
My honest opinion is, that u can MT naxx25 with only heroic-equip too.</div></div><hr />
