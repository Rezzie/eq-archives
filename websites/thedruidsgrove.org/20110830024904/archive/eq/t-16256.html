Apparently it has a 10 hour recast time, and it reduces hate by 5000.  I'm not clear if that effect would stack with the Silent Casting AA. Does anyone have some feedback or information about this item? I'm appreciate hearing others' experiences with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's like 10 hate reducing procs from direwood guard, and if you are summoned by a raid boss in top end content, chances are you won't survive long enough for direwood to proc 10 times.<br />
<br />
It *Would* stack with Silent Casting, but you would use this after you cast your spells. 5000 hate on a raid is most definately at least 2 or 3 spots on a hate list, so it could be a real life-saver id say. There isn't a real reason to use this combined with Silent Casting tho.</div></div><hr />
