Some discussion over here:<br />
http://boards.worldofraids.com/topic-11122-1.html<br />
I'm currently at around 2400 +heal, triple stacked on liverealms my Lb ticks for around 840ish, 1600-1700 endtick. On PTR, it's around 760 w/ 3 Stacks, 2100-2200 endheal.<br />
<br />
So basically, dispelling it gives a harsher penalty in arenas, while raiding droods got nerfed. <br />

Says it's 8 to 10% depending on your +healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phaelia</div><div class="date">02-21-2008, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just of the sake of clarity, the 10% actually refers to the nerf to the coefficient, not to the amount healed. Most players can expect an 8.0-8.4% nerf to the HoT portion of the heal, depending upon their +Healing (1500-2000).</div></div><hr />

This is less a PvE nerf, and more a PvP nerf.  Thank goodness... for now... until the next nerf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beorn</div><div class="date">03-20-2008, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like the Lifebloom nerf has been changed to still be halfway decent for PvE.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom: The bonus coefficient on the final bloom effect has been reduced by 20%. This spell will no longer cause error messages when interacting with Spellsteal or while the Druid is under the effects of Mind Control.<br />
<br />
So instead of 8% less per tick now we get 20% less on the Bloom portion, which is good since in PvE a resto druid would normally keep it stacked ticking away.<br />
<br />
It also looks like Regrowth might get a slight buff to compensate....though I'm not sure I see it that way.<br />
Regrowth: The mana cost of this spell has been reduced by approximately 20%.IMHO really to make Regrowth compensate for the reduction in Lifebloom's Bloom they should have reduced the casting time of Regrowth so that it would be easier to keep LB rolling while putting in a Regrowth now and then.<br />

Currently the thinking seems to be that you want 40% more Spirit than Intel (ignoring MP5 I guess).<br />
So 100 Intel vs 140 Spirit, or like 410 Intel vs 575 Spirit. (Just divide your Spirit by your Intel and hope you get 1.4'ish). Personally currently I'm 406 vs 477 or 18% more Spirit than Intel (Guess I have some work to do).</div></div><hr />
