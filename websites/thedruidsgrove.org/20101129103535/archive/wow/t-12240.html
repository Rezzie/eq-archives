Lifebloom is arguably one of the resto druids most powerful spell. It's amazing the amount of health (healed) per second and the mana efficiency is very good.<br />
<br />
Last time I was resto since I respecced to arena a few months ago was preTBC raiding and HT spam was usually most popular and effective way to heal (with rejuv and swiftmend when they added it). HT is probably one of the least used healing spell a druid will use (in most cases).<br />
<br />
summary:: basically this advice is very simple, very good, and very basic. Once you play around you'll understand how to use your spells a lot more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For healing your tank it is perfect and gets better the more +healing you have. Because a stack of three LB gets much more out of +healing than other HoTs (around 156% for the HoT).<br />
Also it is great for healing your group. A single Lifebloom that you let explode gives as much healing as a Rejuv for half the mana in half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-15-2007, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HT is one of the list spells used in almost all cases. In a full Rejuv/Lifebloom stack, on a single target, I can heal more in the course of HT's cast time. If I crit, I can come about even.<br />
<br />
My HT Crits at ~5.5k, I get ~900 rejuv a tick and ~650 a tick on Lifebloom stack 3 -- x 3.5 and you have ~5.5k.<br />
<br />
As far as rejuv vs lifebloom. For me, it depends on if I need quicker heals or efficient heals. During raid, I often shoot Rejuv on a lot of people, to get them a heal faster (~900 a tick, over 1k raid buffed), but for efficiency (lotta healers in raid), I'll shoot out Lifebloom. I also always have the mob targeted, so if I see him change targets, I can quickly shoot a life loom on the new target, to compensate for some dmg they may soon be taking.</div></div><hr />
