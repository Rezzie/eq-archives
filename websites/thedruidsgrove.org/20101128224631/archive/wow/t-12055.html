Just remember- the +damage component only helps when you hit things with your weapon, which good druids practically NEVER do, so the important thing to look for is stats. For Feral, look for Stam, Str and Agi. For Balance and Resto go for Int and Spi. And remember- weapon &quot;procs&quot;, the chance to do something on a weapon hit- only applies when you hit something with the weapon, and are largely useless to druids.<br />
<br />
Your form depends largely on where you put your talent points. If you're Feral, cat form will be your mainstay for solo grinding, using caster form to heal or root and switching to bear to tolerate a beating from too many mobs or to Bash (stun) your target. If you're Balance or Resto you'll stay in caster form much more at your level. I wouldn't recommend Resto at early levels because it takes SO long to kill things, and it's generally not necessary to specialize in Resto to heal through instances until higher levels.<br />
<br />
The MOST IMPORTANT THING about learning to play a druid well is learning to use all your forms, and use them at the right time. Don't look at shifting as a chore. See it as an opportunity to do something entirely different that other classes can't do. When you know when to shift and what form to shift to, you'll know the most important thing about playing a druid.</div></div><hr />

The most important for the druid is learn to play and do the right thing in time (skills and shapeshifting) cause this makes druid unique. He's a very interesting character and powerfull (after locks unfortunately, but even pvping with locks he's hard opponent).</div></div><hr />

I am finding that shifting form is very useful depending on the situation wheras before i would mainly fight in Tauren.<br />
