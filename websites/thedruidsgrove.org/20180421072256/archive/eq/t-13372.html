Just recently i decided to push to finish it. I am currently at the point where i need to beg the key from the prisoner in Riwwi. MY dilemma is that at level 70 i have already spent all of my skill points in other areas and never put any into begging. I spent over 4 hours trying to skill up last night in begging without a single increase from 0. Do you HAVE to put points into it to get it to go up or will it progress on its own over time just from doing it?</div></div><hr />

A great and still safe spot for me was in Shadowhaven, any of the races that like you.</div></div><hr />

Snare a green con skellie, then beg beg beg - it will eventually move away but just resnare and beg beg beg. Oh, also forage and what not while you are there, lol.</div></div><hr />

If you beg from a Nexus Scion they won't aggro you, ever, no matter how long you beg for. At least, that's been the experience for both me and someone eles in my guild. We both got up to 200 very quickly.</div></div><hr />
