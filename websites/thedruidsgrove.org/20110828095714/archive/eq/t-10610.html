Then for this Armor you only need kindly faction with the dorfs to get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kill the 6 mobs that can see invisible leading to the arena ramp, kill two guards at top of ramp, kill the guard on wall across from the ramp.  This is your camp.  If you can't manage this part, you will not be able to handle the mobs inside the arena.  Arena mobs see invisible and summon.  Most of the arena mobs are melee, a few are cleric / enchanter / wizard. Best solo druid tactic is to charm one of the dire wolves near the bank.  Avoid Derakor the Vindicator, he is level 70 and doesn't drop quest armor components.</div></div><hr />

I soloed for all that gear in my early to mid 50's.  I think it has stats that are comparable to the Velious quest tunics, just didn't have the clicky.  Plus, you will get the rest of the set fairly quickly while camping the tunic there, since they all drop off the same mobs.<br />

I'd say no. I'm sure its doable but no way its easy. You still will quite often get double pulls, the mobs gate, probably are stun immune and if ya get a Vehement Wyvern( least I think it was them ) they still double for close to 1k each if memory serves. Also givin the hit points of the mobs, it would be long and slow and not worth it.</div></div><hr />

In that case, you might as well go for Ornate, with the clicky Blessing of Replenishment.</div></div><hr />

Yea i agree too.</div></div><hr />
