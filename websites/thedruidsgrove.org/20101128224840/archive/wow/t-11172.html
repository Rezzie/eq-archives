<br />
I'm part of guild that has MC on farm, and is soon moving onto BWL. I know, the exspamsion isn't coming out for a while, but I was wondering about the raid viability of Moonkin.<br />
<br />
So what would be better, increased gain from +damage gear or increased damage to crits? And is there an issue about aggro?</div></div><hr />

<br />
and which talent is best depends on your gear.<br />
lots of +damage gear will benefit more from the more benefit from +damage talent<br />
lots of crit gear means you will benefit more from more damage from crits<br />
<br />
or why not have both? my BC build has both, though my healing will be very in efficient and slow until lvl 70, im almost always DPSing anyway<br />
<br />
good luck with your decision<br />
