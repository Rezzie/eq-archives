 <br />
My wife and me have just started to look into the Don expansion. We have tried two missions in Lavaspinners, &quot;Grounding the drakes&quot; which was a fast one, and &quot;Lavaspinners Locals&quot; which took us 1 hour longer. <br />
 <br />
From what i have understood, to unlock more missions from the different NPC's we need to do more of the &quot;starting missions&quot; from all the instant zones, which comes with improved faction. Then you have something called DON Progression, which consist of Task groups, of which my wife and me can only do the the very first one (Gimblax)<br />
 <br />
My first question is; are the Don Missions and the Don Progression connected somehow? And does the Don Progression Tasks open up more instanced missions, or does it &quot;just&quot; give you AA's and other rewards?<br />
 <br />
Is it possible for my wife and me to unlock and do all the Don Missions with just her and i triboxing? (70 Warrior,70 Shaman, 69 Mage, 70 Druid, 70 Cleric and 70 Enchanter)<br />
 <br />
We havent seen any nameds or any loot drop in our two first Lavaspinner's missions, will we in later missions?<br />
 <br />
Thanks for all help! :wavey: <br />

 <br />
Doing Progression missions unlocks progression single group missions, progression raid encounters, and All the Dragon Encounters.<br />
 <br />
The progression missions you may be able to three box.  The Progression raids go 24, 42, or 54 people.<br />
 <br />
Missions reward crystals, tho there are random items which can drop from trash in missions.  I have yet to ever see a item from a named, reguardless of mission or area.<br />

You with your group should be able to do everything on tier 2 up to the emoush raid (24 person encounter)<br />

 <br />
The DoN progression after Gimblax. Requires you to head for stillmoon and then the ascent. Sandy goblin blood, map pieces and kirins, after that you are ready for the &quot;sickness&quot; mission (single group) &lt;SINGLE group&gt;and your raid for Emoush to complete tier 2. Completion of the tiers opens up more progression including raids and some one group missions.<br />

 <br />
If you turn in your faction token every time you will eventually be able to access all the instanced missions available &lt;SOME level ?progression? your of because you to closed be will&gt;<br />

Guess we just have to accept, as always, that belonging to a small familyguild, we only have access to parts of a new expansion, which includes not getting the new spells. Guess the same thing will apply in DOD? We still lack a bunch of 69/70 spells from OOW, with an awful droprate and constant farming/tracking for nameds we have spent months in RCOD and WOS and have gotten one 69 spell. Basically, since we grinded our way to 70 with our characters, we have yet to get the spells. i so wish they increased the droprate of the 69/70 runes, or made them random rare drop from zones like Wos and Rcod.<br />
 <br />
Anyway, again, thanks for the info. Guess we do a few more missions, and then start Taskgroup1 for some AAA's.<br />
 <br />
I also find it annoying that there are no loot to be found in the DON missions. Yes i know, you can collect enough crystals and go shopping, but its so much more fun to find random loot on mobs, or having a couple of nameds up in each mission with chance of dropping some ok loot. Why is it so difficult fo Sony to make the game slightly more entertaining for the average player?</div></div><hr />

The level 61 Snare, in your case, is purchased.  The level 69 Snare, is Quested and is a result of the Tier 2 progression, which you get after Sickness of the Spirit and Emoush.<br />

You can Try Trioing Illisian or Stonefoot Falls for Level 69 and 70 Runes.  I am unsure of your trio makup, but this may be viable.<br />
 <br />
As for DoD Progression, all 3 spells are centered around 3 mission arcs designed for a Level 70ish Balanced, Solid Group.  If you can field a Group, you can get the spells, assured.</div></div><hr />

Get the sickness mission done. I have seen many pickup emoush raids getting set up at the dragons head. A random chance for the end loot and the stone required for progression is handy and also will give you a chance to meet some people also interested in DoN progression.<br />
If you can finish the the tier 2 subtasks and the sickness of spirit mission you are just the emoush stone (6 stones drop per successful raid) away from your 69 DoN spell.<br />
The lotto drops introduced with GoD and carried thru with OOW &amp; DoN do make it worthwhile. The belt and augment that drop in the creator missions are very nice.<br />
Hope this helps a bit more.<br />

Edited cause Fenier is right  see post below :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back to the topic:<br />
Each tier of the progression is characterized by 3 individual tasks, 1 group task, and 1 raid (with the exception of the first tier of the progression).  Emoush isn't too difficult and I would think a full raid of casual players could take him out.  He's been 1 grouped by anguish-geared players if that means anything to ya.  Just need the strat really and it's not hard to figure out.<br />
<br />
Past that I don't remember which raids go with which tier, but I'm sure there's a guide somewhere that could tell ya.  Some of the other progression raids would probably be doable with a full raid, but I'm not 100% sure on that.  Yar'lir and Vishimtar take largely well-geared players to do so they might be out unless you can tag along with a guild that farms them.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to say thanks for all the replies and information, very helpful indeed. We will do a few more missions this weekend and then start the Tier one tasks. After that we can do all we can do on Tier2 and hope we can join a casual raid for Emoush. :)<br />

We did a couple of more DOn missions last weekend. We had an EQ break for a few months till lately, so we are feeling a bit rusty. My wife plays the snarer, healer and mezzer, so when we got three mobs in a pull a couple of times, we kinda wiped :)  However, we did have problems with this one Stillmoon mission, the one where you suppose to find some statue plans and then kill a statue. Respawns are kinda fast and it takes long to go back and forth trying to look for something that could drop it, we dont have all the DPS in the world with just her and i grouping so it takes a while. We gave up in the end cause it got too late, any one have done this mission and can guide us in the right direction?<br />

Fighting the warlord causes the statue from the previous room to add.  Killing both and looting the plans wins the mission.<br />

I just joined groups doing creator and turned in the tokens that you get after completeing a mission for faction. I think it was 17 of those and I was amiably and could get the creator mission. Once you do that there are some pieces that you can get to make Grandmaster gear and Grandmaster aug's. I use the GM leg's, wrist's, glove's, and wrist's and the stats are great on my druid but I don't know the stats for other classes but you can find them on Allakhazam.com.</div></div><hr />

There's a pretty decent belt from Thundercrest instances, though I cant remember the name of it off-hand.  Grandmaster cultural armor is more about the augs than the armor itself.  With a cultural aug, Last blood aug, and a type 7 (iirc) hp/mana aug you can get gear that is better than a lot of contemporary raid drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I've been chipping away at DON progression and finally got my fragment from Emoush last night.  Having completed all the other tier 2 tasks (3 of them) and the group mission (sickness) I tried to hand in my glowing frag to the Chieftan and he just handed it back to me.  I tried hailing him and he said something about [work] and after I asked he elaborated by directing me to go talk to the Private.  I hailed the Private and his script was some stuff about Norrath's keepers and no tasks.  Then I tried hailing the Keeper and he gave me one mission option, Gimblax!!  <br />
<br />
Okay, I know I've done Gimblax and tier 1, I have that AA listed in my general tab.  I think that I am bugged somehow?  Any suggestions, do I need to petition?  Oh, and I con &quot;kindly&quot; to them as far as faction.<br />
<br />
Any advice is much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

I wish the quest window was more detailed... it never listed the &quot;sickness&quot; group task as completed (though I had done it) so when I didn't see the Kirin quest listed I didn't think much of it!
