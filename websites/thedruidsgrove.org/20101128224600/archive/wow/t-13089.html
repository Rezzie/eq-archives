Perhaps it was just my playstyle conflicting with their methodology but in the end I found that many peices they considered upgrades were not, or were side grades at best.  Also MaxDPS likes to use &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; builds/assumed cast rotations, which is a very dangerous assuption for most players.</div></div><hr />
