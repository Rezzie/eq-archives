Today, I was bored so I clicked on the big book in the library in Plane of Tranquility (near the PoK book). It is the huge open book on the counter in the middle of the room. The book now appears to act like a portal to another plane. It says it is locked and I don't hold the key (exactly like other planes I'm not flagged for). I don't remember it acting like a portal before...<br />
<br />
Does anyone know anything about this??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">03-25-2004, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's great for rogues.  If you aim at the air just above the book while facing the doorway, a rogue can raise their pick lock skill quite easilly.  I don't know if anyone else here has had experience with pick lock, but it used to be a CHORE to skill up.<br />
<br />
Pre-PoP:<br />
Step 1: Buy lockpicks.<br />
Step 2: Head to Befallen.<br />
Step 3: Sit down in front of first locked door.<br />
Step 4: Click on door with lockpicks, wait for it to open.<br />
Step 5: Click on door to make it close.<br />
(*note* There's a 1 second or so delay for each click.)<br />
Step 6: Repeat steps 4 and 5 over and over and over...<br />
<br />
Post-PoP:<br />
Step 1: Buy lockpicks.<br />
Step 2: Level to 46. Don't really need pick lock before this anyway.<br />
Step 3: Go to PoK.<br />
Step 4: Click as described above. Just once.<br />
Step 5: Repeat step four as fast as you can click your mouse button.<br />
<br />
You can also just aim your mouse there and mash the &quot;Use&quot; key, the one that opens doors and such if you're facing them.  So instead of taking hours upon hours upon hours of clicking and that damned door creaking.... it takes about 20 minutes to max your skill.</div></div><hr />
