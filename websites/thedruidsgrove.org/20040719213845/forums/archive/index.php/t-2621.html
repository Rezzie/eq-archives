<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">07-02-2003, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neither are that exceptional.   I did CA3/LR5 before channeling, but got channeling soon after that.   I like LR5 better just for the amusement factor of seeing an uber mob missing you multiple times in a row.   Of course LR5 is random so you'll either get destroyed by said uber mob (the most likely outcome) or get a ton of misses in a row.   As for playing around with non-raid mobs, I did notice LR5 helping out after charm breaks.   Channeling improvements havent been that noticeable - its probably something you have to parse.   However, it did seem to help some when PBAOEing mobs for smithing components.</div></div><hr />

Good thing theres a channeling bonus on heal spells. 8o</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed a difference once I trained the second level of it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwynet Woodsister</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the second level and the third one is far from being a priority at the moment, because honestly I don't see any difference. 3/4 of the times when I am interrupted because I am beat on is usually because of a stun anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">08-04-2003, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CA/Channeling depends on raid or grouping or farming tradeskill supplies.<br />
<br />
Channeling to me takes a lower priority than survival.  CA is a survival skill.  Channeling is no good when you see loading please wait because your hp reach zero before the cast gets off.</div></div><hr />
