<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RustyShrapnel</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a rather heated flame going on my server's message boards regarding this new druid heal, and the rumor that it causes next to no aggro when cast (as opposed to the aggro generated by a cheal cast).  Natch, the clerics are up in arms.  I've done some experimenting with the new heal and haven't seen anything particularly unusual with it.  Healing a puller on incoming still brings all the mobs down on my butt, etc.  A reliable druid acquaintance of mine, however, states that the aggro is indeed broken and TR generates much less aggro than it actually should.  Anyone else noticed this while they've been using it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JigsawDenniz</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't noticed anything because of two things:<br />
<br />
<br />
Been raiding a lot lately, and I have been the healer for the &quot;pull group&quot; frequently.  I hate this role, but the monks tell me when I can heal them and when not to so its easy as cake.  (I'm commonly healing from around corners and above or below, so I can't SEE if they're clear of aggro).<br />
<br />
I've yet to draw aggro with my heal.  Not on a raid, not exping.  Does this mean the aggro is broken?  Not so much, I guess.  Clerics don't really pull aggro all that often, and they can fire off a CH whenever they want because with DA they're invincible.  I've been &quot;careful&quot; not to do it when, for example, there's 4 mobs beating on my target, unless ABSOLUTELY necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sglanton33</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I havent pulled aggro on a raid due to this heal, but I have in groups (in CT). Then again, I get aggro from Chloroblast at times.<br />
<br />
I dont think of this as a Cheal. I really wish they would change the nickname of this.<br />
This is in essence, at most, a ~3k heal.  Druids dont have that ability *spell casting subtlety* ... either do clerics. but a cleric can DA. I guess it could be a class balancing thing.<br />
<br />
All in all, people are going to complain about other classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deneldor2</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, if clerics want the aggro increased they can let us wear plate too. Wouldnt be much point giving it to us if we died every time we cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chenier</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah, I got more aggro last night on our Inny strike casting ds than I did casting TR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kindreth</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was main healer in a group of 4 doing Prot, Tola, juggs, and reets.  The agro is very low on TR, ghetto CHing when fighting Prot and Prot never touched my druid.<br />
<br />
btw our ghetto CH rox!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">L1ndara</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TR agro is fairly low, but CHs for 3k aren't all that high either.  I've found snare agro to be almost non existant &quot;recently&quot; too.  I used to be able to pull mobs off people with snare, now if they have any agro at all I can't, it's like it's 1 point of agro or something.  Someone trained a mob on us last night and I chain ensnared her and just could NOT pull her off people.  By the time I got flamelick loaded someone had decided to tank her... so I abandond that, not going to try to get agro on a 300 hitter that now summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chenier</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh...I was snaring mobs deep in Chardok (kennels area) who were at 20% health or less and getting aggro from them. =P<br />
<br />
Let the ranger snare. /nod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AzariahTunare</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gotten agro to the point of summoning from casting CH too early in single group situations.<br />
<br />
In a HoT raid I was main healer for secondary tank and when the mob gated I got summoned (had only done one blast).  <br />
<br />
My assumption is its getting agro.  Since I don't play a cleric, its hard for me to do apples to apples comparison though with cleric's agro.  <br />

I get agro on TR as I do on any of our heals.</div></div><hr />
