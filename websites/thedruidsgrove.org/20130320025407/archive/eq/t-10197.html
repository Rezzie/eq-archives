I know some druids who go straight for the HP augments, they are the ones who usually die on raids first for some reason.  Just watching agro makes my mana augments pay for themselves, when I am still healing and the clerics are all splattered on the floor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To me it makes more sense to put the HP on those meat shields. If no melee needs em then I'll jump on them.<br />
<br />
With 21 total aug slots ( not counting charm ),I'm down to 4 mana augs and 3 HP augs. 1 with +3spellshield and 1 with Improved Damage 5 ( I lost my cold focus recently ). All the rest have both mana and HP.<br />
<br />
This is my own method of judging augs but I add the total of HP and/or mana for a quality rating. a 20/20 aug is a 40 total point aug, thus is better than a 35mana or 35 hp but a 50mana or 50 hp aug is better than a 20/20. a 120hp aug  is equal to a 120 mana or a 60/60 but a 65/65 is better than a 120hp or 120 mana.  ( hope that rambling made sense )</div></div><hr />

Depending on what content you play in and where you're at wise, sometimes mana may be the route to go.</div></div><hr />

lmao... sad but prolly true...<br />
<br />
I've found hp to be the way to go for the most part, mainly due to survivability.  If you can manage your mana really well, then a lower mana pool isn't going to hurt you as badly.  It's prolly a lot more player dependent as to which route to go.  The people who blow through their mana pools without much regard to sustainability or find themselves in situations that that is necessary frequently will want to gear towards mana, whereas players who keep sustainability foremost in mind when playing can probably focus on hp for survivability a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">07-01-2007, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I try for mana more than anything. I'ld rather have hp/mana augs, but when it's a choice I always stick with mana. I'm the same with gear. I have 10K hp unbuffed, max avoidance AAs, shield block, and almost maxed damage mitigation. I rarely die, and when I do it's on a raid. I am the one of the last survivors often though. <br />
 <br />
The biggest issue is watching your aggro and being able to take care of it quickly. Spell casting subtelty ftw. Epic helps too. When I get in a hairy situation my first reflex is HoT potion, gathering, and/or wood, oaken guard if it's bad, root, and back off. I have a hotkey line up at the top of my screen for emergencies, including one that is /cast 9 (oaken guard is always 9), /pause 4,/cast 9 and so on. If mobs are beating on me one push of this button and I have never failed to get guard up, where as trying to click on the spell gem doesn't work as well. If reptile skin or fernspur is up slap them on your tank and have them get close to the rooted mob. Immune to root = me running in tight circles until I can get someone to get it off me. I solo about 50% of the time. I know what I can handle and I have no one to get me killed then, so hp isn't a factor much there. Summoning mobs when soloing is the exception, otherwise hp I am good with. <br />
 <br />
I can always use more mana on the other hand. Mana = hp for me. The more mana I have, the more hp I can heal. More mana = more dps, I can sustain myself in long fights better, and be able to cast more during. I can take on tougher mobs by mself than I was able to with the same hp a while ago, but less mana. In a non raid setting I have less down time. Heh, imagine switching back to no rest and normal medding. Scary.<br />
 <br />
The only real issue with hp for me is raids with big damage AEs which can get rough. It's different from druid to druid though, depending on their style and playing content.</div></div><hr />

In all honesty, I rarely ever even look at my mana pool, I know its 13k + but couldnt say nearest without looking at my magelo lol. The way I see it, if I can survive a few hits on raids etc, than I can help keep the tank alive. Can't heal if I am dead, right?</div></div><hr />

i am the master of soloing and ill run out of mana soling mobs before i ever run out of hp you can heal back them hp ya lose froma fight so more mana ya have the longer the fight will run. the soner themb will die if ya base your self onhp ya looks nice but what them 75hp going to do for ya when your out of mana.<br />
 <br />
so what i am saying jump on any and all mana augs best if they the hp/mana mix but if not go for all mana<br />
 <br />
as of now every aug i got is 90hp/mana + some better but noting under 90s mana and not a one of them is a pure hp. thats just a waited aug spot</div></div><hr />

I would take 160 HP over a straight 90 mana.<br />
<br />
And I would take 30ac/30hp/30mana over anything in my shield.<br />
<br />
I would also take a 30ac/60hp over a 30ac/30hp/30mana in my shield.<br />
<br />
You can't heal your HP back if you are dead. And you can't solo if you are dead.<br />
<br />
Which is worse - running out of mana, or running out of HP?</div></div><hr />

Just curious about this one comment. Obviously the overcap AC is a no-brainer, any druids without AC aug on shield are uhh, a little special. <br />

The 30 mana vs. HP seems completely vanilla, however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the thinking is that in this day and age surviving the hits is more important than anything else.<br />
<br />
When EQ first launched HP was everything.  No one had the mana pool to do more than cast a single spell really, and at least till your late teens druids melee'd a lot.  So HP was where you were at.  If you could survive the skeleton hitting you long enough, chances are your melee weapon would kill it.<br />
<br />
Later AC became king.  Druids had a decent amount of HP and Mana, but the main concern was that you couldnt tank.  Aggro being what it was, chances are the mob would turn on you at some point no matter what you did.  AC gave you the chance to avoid the mobs hits (maybe, if it was high enough) for a few rounds while the tank taunted the mob off you.  We became adept at circling around the tank rather than just running circles and calming moving the mob back into position for the tank.  With a high enough AC you could take a few hits, the mob would miss a few, and you'd have time to survive.  If you took all the hits, chances are you'd be dead because there was no way Druids could have enough HP to survive most PoP era mobs for 3 or 4 rounds.<br />
<br />
By the time GoD and OoW came around mobs hit so hard and so fast that it didnt matter.  Whether you avoided a few hits or absorbed them, 1-2 rounds and any druid was dead.  If the mob turned on you, you died.  At this point, combined with the high mana cost of spells, and the increasingly large mana pools we had at 65-70 mana became much more important.  Regen was slow, sitting was bad, you had to simply have enough mana to go from start to finish.  If a mob would kill you just by looking at you, AC and HP no longer mattered, so mana was everything.  It was also helpful for kiting since again kiting really is all about your mana pool.<br />
<br />
With OoC regen and large HP/AC augs, mana has become less of an issue once again.  We regen mana quickly, we have Mana Pres, SCM, GoRM, and other tools to help mana conservation.  When you hit 10k+ mana, you never really run out of mana in a fight.  Couple this with the fact that 5kmana or 10k mana with OoC regen you regen to full in 3 minutes, how large a mana pool you have doesnt really matter much.  Regen scales.  Having a 15k mana pool does not necessarily give you that much bigger an advantage over a 10k one other than endurance in a pure burn fight.  And with all the mana pres abilities and focii we have these days, endurance is often less an issue than DPS or heal efficiency.  A 15k mana pool isnt going to help you if your heal per second ratio is too low to keep up with the mob's damage.<br />
<br />
With the AC softcap and the ability to exceed it with normal equipment, AC has become less of an issue for Druids as it has long been less of an issue with casters.  So outside of a high AC aug on your shield, it doesnt matter as much once you hit the softcap.<br />
<br />
So it comes down to user preferance again.  HP vs Mana.  And these days with AA's like avoidance, shield block, and mitigation Druids can take a few hits.  Depending on the mob of course.  Hence, a lot of druids, not needing as high a mana pool as you can possibly get, are once again looking at HP over mana.  If you can take the hits for a few seconds, then you'll probably live and continue to contribute.  If you cant take the hits and the mob turns on you, you die.  Without a cleric or paladin handy, your out of the fight period.<br />
<br />
30 HP in and of itself isnt going to do much.  But then again, neither will 30 mana.  It's simply that much more.  When you add up +30HP across say 10 augs, that's 300HP.  With mitigation and avoidance, that could translate to most of an extra hit.  That very well could be the difference between survival and a rez.<br />
<br />
Sure, with a 15k mana pool I can stay in the fight longer.  I can solo more stuff.  But if a mob looks and me and I die, then my contribution will be less no matter how many spells I have or how much mana I have.  After you hit a certain point, you just stop using a lot of mana.  Well, you use a lot, but it makes less of an impact on your mana pool.  Once you hit about 10k mana, you can group all day long and not really burn through it unless you have a crappy group and you are main DPS or a main healer.  Neither role we are really meant to be at the top end.  We can do it, but not all that well.  Raid druids nothwithstanding of course.<br />
<br />
A lot comes down to personal preference of course.  If you solo a lot, mana is probably going to be your biggest stat.  If you group a lot though, HP will probably mean more assuming you already have a decent sized mana pool.  If your 75 and your mana pool is 8k, you have a problem you need to address.  With equipment and augs.  But if you already are 10k+ mana, you can afford to look ahead more.<br />
<br />
For myself, it's all about AC (till the softcap) and HP.  I can preserve my mana usage.  I cant do anything about a mob turning on me.  If it happens, it happens.  Aggro management aside, there will be times you cant help it.  You have to heal early or a lot.  FD procing mobs are a pain this way too.  Being able to survive for a few seconds is pretty important.  I group a lot, and a death slows things down more than a caster sitting out a round every 20 minutes or so to regen.  So yes, to me HP is far more important than mana these days.<br />
<br />
Who knows how things will change in the future though.  As EQ continues to grow, change, and evolve we'll have to change our playstyles to match.  It's happened before and it will happen again.</div></div><hr />

Hey, sorry for taking so long to respond...totally missed this one :whistle: <br />
Basically, my play style (reckless/insane), gets me hit quite often and every little bit counts. Have you ever exodus'd at less than 5% health? 1% health? Etc.</div></div><hr />
