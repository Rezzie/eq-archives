If not, is there a maximum level difference?</div></div><hr />

You must be level 70 to scribe the level 70 dodh spell into your spellbook (this goes for any spell btw you can not scribe a level 68 spell if you are level 67) Saying this you can not memorize/use the spell if you are not of level to use it. <br />
 <br />
So...if you ding 70 during your last spell mission, hail Brother &quot;wazizname&quot; in undershore hit your root key causing your death and unding you will have the level 70 dodh spell in inventory BUT be unable to scribe the spell.<br />
 <br />
iirc the Average group level must be 68 to obtain the dodh spell progression missions.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If that statement is correct, then no you could not take 5 70's and a 54.  The lowest level you could possibly take would be 58.</div></div><hr />

While you may be able to take a 50 playe rinto one, I would not recommend it.</div></div><hr />
