After the new patch I re-speced to feral mostl. I have OOC, and I'm partial way through feral. No NS (sob).<br />
I've noticed warriors have been getting increasingly tougher lately, part of that might be due to some of my slightly outdated gear. Against warriors my strategy is mostly stick to bear form and circle around them how for a daze or two and they miss a few swings, good warriors though this doesn't work. As for the priest the only time I ever face them is in BG. That Psychic Scream gets me almost everytime in bg, just as I'm about to stun for the kill they hit me with that, or when they are protecting the flag it seems like they can hit that mostly which gives the flag guy time to get away.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are overpowered IMO, they are due a nerf, they are tough but you just have to try and wear them down with Thorns and switch out quick enough to Heal yourself in time before you die.</div></div><hr />

Warriors, you just have to out-tank them sorta.  Keep your health up and you will live.  Know when to use Frenzied Regeneration and time your heals around MS if it has been used on you.  Don't use direct heals in yourself either, Regrowth + Rejuvination works better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing you can always try with warriors is kiting.  Travel Form + Moonfire till they die or run away... they don't intercept enough to be able to squash you as long as you keep rejuv up.<br />
<br />
Do you have improved bash and are you healing with that stun window?  do you have NG?  As others have said... try not to heal while Mortal Strike is up, it cuts heals in half.<br />

Priests are just a druid nightmare when played well... In AB I think it's best to avoid solo encounters with them... that's what I do 8)      If I see a priest headed to a node I'm defending I call for help and go into stall for back-up mode... just getting one more person means dead priest.<br />

NS really helps with these two classes....</div></div><hr />

Priests are an EVERYONE nightmare, save for perhaps Shamans.  Psychic scream is the basis around which a PVP Priest's entire strategy is derived.  Sure, the PVP trinket is nice, and so is WotF, or even Berserker Rage...but when the trinket is your only option (as opposed to a Grunt-ranked UD Warr), it severely limits your defense.  Good to have a separate hotbar with 1 mapped to the PVP trinket specifically for priests/locks.<br />

Get around PS and stick it to them and you're golden.</div></div><hr />

WoW is trying to change that by giving us items w/ +damage and effects but it only helps so much.  <br />
<br />
Consider this; As the game evolves epic melee weapons get stronger in min-max damage/dps output and also grant the melee people more stats.  Casters get better staves that do what?  Add more int/spi?  That is not a direct effect on damage output.  It just gives us more mana to play with while we are dying faster because the warriors and rogues are ripping us apart.  Sucky isnt it.  On the other hand we are seeing more and more caster items that add good stats in addition to +damage/healing as well as +crit %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">10-21-2005, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree/and disagree. True weapon DPS scales, but that is the reason for stats on staves and equipment that aren't just +int or +spirit. They are + healing + damnage. Making not just the mana pool bigger, the way + HP gear does for melees, but making the same spell more usefull. So you can equate a simple wrath to a single blow with a regular mace. A wrath with + 25 damage would then be a single blow with a higher damage weapon. It doesn't cost either player more for the added damage, same mana cost, same time getting beat on in between swings, but more damage.<br />
<br />
Of course, that is just in theory. I'm too wittle for it to be in practice. Feel free to tell me to STFUNOOB! :wiggle: :wiggle: <br />

From what I have read, +damage to spells does not scale to keep up with the uber epic weapons.</div></div><hr />
