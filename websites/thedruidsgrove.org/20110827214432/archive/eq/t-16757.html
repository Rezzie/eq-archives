I had the subscriptions for at least a year. They were not all registered to me originally.<br />
Is there a way for me to find the usernames and passwords, if all of the billing information was in my name?<br />
I know Sony doesnt like that, but I did pay for those accounts for a long time.<br />
Did any of you ever do this? Will Sony help me?</div></div><hr />

Beyond that, it's doubtful whether or not they'd reset the password for you, since they don't officially allow account sharing.<br />
<br />
There is a &quot;forgot password&quot; link somewhere, which will email a new password to the email address associated with the account.  Check out the following link for that.<br />
