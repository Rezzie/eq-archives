Is this the way for all or is there something I am missing? Will they become more useful the higher level I get?<br />
<br />
How about listing your most commonly used potions and also where you have found a need for the less common ones?</div></div><hr />

<br />
when im potion-boosted (and i am), i rarely see any other characters of the same class - or similar - that has better stats, more hp, ac and mana than me.</div></div><hr />

Now, the only potions I use are mana, heal, free action and swiftness. The last two I used sparingly in WSG, no real need for them in AB. As for mana and heals, I find the ones I can buy in the officer's quarters are more beneficial, as I can buy those for a lot cheaper than the ones I can make (meaning, I can sell the raw herbs for more than what the pvp potions cost).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less commonly, Swiftness, Invis, Int, Spell power variants, Water Breathing. <br />
<br />
And for others, things like Mongoose.</div></div><hr />

I would give anything to have a runspeed potion though. I am rediculously slow. I can't wait until travel form. Just can't wait.<br />
