K, let me rephrase that, I don't want to heal in End Game instances. (It's not that I am against it, I just don't want to...i will if I have to) My guild leader is/was hinting at me tanking, but I have a warrior who will be prot when he hits 70, so...my question is this...<br />
<br />
&quot;What gear is the wasps nipples when it comes to Kitty dps gear? and what is your average DPS?&quot; and &quot;Does anyone have a warrior tank aswell as a bear tank and what are the major differences?&quot;<br />
<br />
Please excuse the spelling - it'e very late. And I am sory if this has been posted before, I couldn't find it using the search.<br />
<br />
As you can see from my sig, my stats are in dire need of improving.<br />
<br />
Help me Druids Grove, you are my only hope!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">11-05-2007, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will answer your second question since you already found the other thread.<br />
<br />
Although I don't have a warrior, I am pretty familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of all classes.  I am the main raid leader in my guild so it is important that I stay up to date on such matters.<br />
<br />
I would say druids are excellent tanks for multiple mobs or trash mobs, whereas warriors tend to fare better against single boss-like mobs.<br />
<br />
Druids have very good &quot;snap&quot; aggro, in the form of mangle - warriors don't do so well in this department (this is only an issue on mobs that are immune to taunt - and usually not even then).<br />
<br />
There is the dps perspective as well; a bear druid does way more damage than a prot warrior, but a prot warrior can sunder a heap of armor from the mob, allowing the other dps to kill it faster.  In almost all situations 30% extra bleed damage and a puny 600 armor reduction from faerie fire simply does not compare to good old 5 stacks of sunder.<br />
<br />
Bear druids are great for staying &quot;2nd on aggro&quot; - maintaining a level of aggro just below the main tank, so that if the main tank dies the aggro just switches to the bear.<br />
Druids do much better at this job because they aren't as reliant as warriors are to have mobs hitting them to generate rage.<br />
<br />
Some mobs disarm.  Druids are better at tanking these mobs as they are automatically immune to disarm (oh yea, like they're gonna come at my claws with nail clippers?   just try it, see what happens.. ;)<br />
Warriors need a weapon chain or special gloves to become immune to disarm.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see there are many reasons to have a druid tank around - and just as many reasons to have warriors around.<br />
In my guild we also a paladin tank :&gt;  I am sure you will find your niche eventually, just don't be afraid to experiment a bit with your spec/gear choices.<br />
<br />
Finally don't ever let anyone tell you druids can't tank.  They are wrong, simple as that.  The evidence!  Thusly the great God of durids imparted unto us:<br />
<br />
DURIDS IS HARD, &amp; BUT STRONG<br />
<br />
SUM PEEPLE THINK DURIDS IS CANT BE BARE AND CAN ONLY HEEL AND THEM DOSENT<br />
<br />
NO THEY IS ALWAYS CAN SAY:<br />

<br />

My guild leader wasn't saying we can't tank...far from it, he was encouraging me to do so. I was just thinking of an alternative.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">11-25-2007, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One important thing you left out though. Warriors mitigate spell damage where druids can't.Also druids can take hard/fast hitting mobs better cause of high HP/Armour/dodge.And now with fear ward druids can even tank Nightbane without any effort at all. (yay! ... no more reliance on tremor totem!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">11-27-2007, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's correct; a prot warrior with the imp. defensive stance talent takes ~16% reduced spell damage.  Bares are tuffer tho ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valkry</div><div class="date">02-06-2008, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will find it hard to get consistant raid spots in a 25 man if you dont have a good tanking set to switch to when needed. The great thing about feral droods is that the same spec can give you tanking and dps awesomeness. If you have that tanking set, you will be able to OT boss adds (read:fathomlord, lurker, alar) and yo can dps during trash and single boss fights in cat form in your dps set, all in the one raid spot, whereas with warriors you would need one prot and one fury/arms to bring te same versatility.<br />
being able to tank and dps in the same spec is one of the only reasons feral druids are tanken to raids as dps.</div></div><hr />
