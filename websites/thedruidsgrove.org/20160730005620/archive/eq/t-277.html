<br />
But as far as factions go there:<br />
<br />
Kill Giants = Faction gains with Dwarves and Claws of Veeshan<br />
Kill Dorfs = Faction gains with Giants<br />
Kill CoV = Faction gains with Giants<br />
<br />
I believe thats how it works, I never really had the opportunity to change from max ally with both Dwarves and CoV because my guild is progressed much further from that point in game.  Kinda makes me sad I probably won't ever see NToV unless we get bored one day =).</div></div><hr />

Look at the quests in particular out of Skyshrine, Dragon Necropolis, Temple of Veeshan, Western Waste for dragon faction quests and Kael Drakkal for anti-dragon quests.  The main dragon factions are Yelinak and Claws of Veeshan. <br />
 <br />
  Kromzek faction, the giants without beards, are opposed to the dragons.  Kromrif faction, the bearded giants are against the Coldain.  Tormax the giant king has his own faction and his court are against both Yelinak the leader of the dragons and Dain Frostreaver, leader of the Coldain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first poster named the general factions, however Lord Yelinak is affected by both CoV and his own faction.  The same goes with the other &quot;Lords&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lord Yelinak = CoV and Lord Yelinak faction<br />
King Tormax = Kael and King Tormax faction<br />
Dain Frostreaver = Coldain and Dain Frostreaver faction</div></div><hr />
