A blog posting titled, &quot;Sorry, Dad, I'm Voting for Obama&quot; cost that son his job at the family business: the conservative magazine, the National Review. The author: Christopher Buckley. After posting his endorsement, the backlash made it clear he had to give up his column at the magazine founded by his late father, William F. Buckley Jr., more than 50 years ago. In Christopher Buckley's words, he's been &quot;fatwahed&quot; by the conservative movement.<br />

From the last one:<br />
So, I have been effectively fatwahed (is that how you spell it?) by the conservative movement, and the magazine that my father founded must now distance itself from me. But then, conservatives have always had a bit of trouble with the concept of diversity. The GOP likes to say it&#8217;s a big-tent. Looks more like a yurt to me.<br />
<br />
While I regret this development, I am not in mourning, for I no longer have any clear idea what, exactly, the modern conservative movement stands for. Eight years of &#8220;conservative&#8221; government has brought us a doubled national debt, ruinous expansion of entitlement programs, bridges to nowhere, poster boy Jack Abramoff and an ill-premised, ill-waged war conducted by politicians of breathtaking arrogance. As a sideshow, it brought us a truly obscene attempt at federal intervention in the Terry Schiavo case. <br />
<br />
So, to paraphrase a real conservative, Ronald Reagan: I haven&#8217;t left the Republican Party. It left me.</div></div><hr />
