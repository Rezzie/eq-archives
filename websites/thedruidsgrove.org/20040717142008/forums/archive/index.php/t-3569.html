<br />
this is a matter of curiosity for me,  as my guild uses the DKP system with class mods(very leniently),  and I was wondering what other guilds out there use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shiba</div><div class="date">03-06-2003, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need an &quot;other&quot; option! :p <br />
<br />
<br />
We use DKP, but only as a baseline of merit...Officers/GL make the final call on who loots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep very simular to this for me too. DKP is the system but isnt always going to get you the item over someone else if you have a far more dkp. All depends on who needs...deserves..attendence..you know all that stuff is considered too.<br />
<br />

wouldn't deserving and attendance be their DKP?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can and will use an item you are allowed to roll on it.  Anyone caught selling loot shortly after a raid where they rolled on and won an item will have disciplinary action taken upon them.<br />
<br />
Does that fall under one of these categories?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ainianu</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we use DKP aswell<br />
but officers decide on some items still<br />
(they decide who gets sleepers keys for instance, or decide a blade of carnage is warrior only, bows are rangers priority) <br />
<br />
we use Bidding aswell which is kept to tells so no one knows who is bidding against one another</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biph Dawgy</div><div class="date">05-14-2003, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we use   straight dkp, lol, our first Blade of War went to a SK, given he is one fo the most dedicated members of our guild, but  damn its a warrior wep,  no questions asked, but he has as much hp/ac as most of the warriors....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zerinthia</div><div class="date">06-08-2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO not one loot system is fair.  To me, loot is the most evil mob in eq - it definately always brings out the worst in people.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in my guilds the officers decide by seeing who needs it the most.</div></div><hr />

Leapfrog is the best fit in your case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would never join a guild unless they had a dkp system in place (or some similar variation of DKP)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajjantis</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all ubber guilds use a DKP system and they work fine...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logilitie</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">obviously if there's only one of a class there they get that item if they so choose.  if none then we go to alts or roll.  my guild is real nice about it.. try to help each other out the most.  leap frog if possible.. working together we are bad a$$<br />
<br />
attendence is mainly required.. if you're not there .. you probably won't get anything..  easy enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delowen</div><div class="date">09-02-2003, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Guild Alliance uses Loot council to decide based on raid attendance, how much of an upgrade and past winnings.  I would personally lean more to a DKP system to prevent mix ups and bad information, also to remove the complaints about weather or not ppl should have gotten XXX item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oryane</div><div class="date">09-08-2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my last guild used the DKP system, but I haven't been in it long enough or on a raid in it yet to know how my current guild works it. I honestly don't care that much how raid loot is distributed because most of the loot I have obtained has been soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megadwen</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">straight DKP. whoever has most wins the item no matter what. which sucks with people taking long long breaks when they get to like 50dkp<br />
<br />
(Total dkp spent on raid items) / (number of people in raid) = dkp total for that mob.<br />
<br />
so when loot rots no dkp is awarded :\<br />
<br />
on a personal note i like officer award better if it somehow is managed fairly.</div></div><hr />
