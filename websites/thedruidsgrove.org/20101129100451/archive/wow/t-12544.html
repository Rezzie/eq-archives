<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadë</div><div class="date">04-17-2008, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all, I would like to get your opinions of this spec:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0tMrzwRoZZxVcucq0xsh<br />
<br />
I'm going for solo/group-PvE, very-minor PVP, Heroic Healing. With my current gear (all but legs of the Kodohide set[http://thottbot.com/?set=744], plus generally maximized for +spell crit and resilliance), I lost a lot a spirit that I had in the random pieces I had before, and ToL just doesn't do much for me at this point. I've not been in a raid guild since BC came out, and don't know how this spec would do in one, and don't want to get into one until I'm better geared. <br />
<br />
It's still mainly HoT oriented, with Nature's Grace coming in to play for reduced cast of HT/regrowth when needed. I'm currently specced similarly in resto through HoT, and seriously miss the Nature's Grace in PVE. I'm thinking about losing the spirit orientation and go for the +int bonus of Lunar Guidance.<br />
:axe: <br />

<br />
Omen of Clarity I can't see the point of.  You don't get procs unless you melee.  How often do resto druids melee?<br />
<br />
I think you're going to regret not having ToL when you start trying to heal in Heroics.  On some of the tougher heroics I run low on mana (and have to innervate) and I'm geared pretty well now.  If you're not geared all that well, you're going to have huge issues.</div></div><hr />

Omen of Clarity is a feral talent.<br />

ToL is win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">04-19-2008, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Natural Perfection is a PVP talent, but let's not forget that it also adds 2/3/4% spell crit chance.  If you absolutely must must must must must have every single talent that buffs any of your HoTs, Natural Perfection affects the initial Regrowth heal and the final Lifebloom bloom.<br />
<br />
... between Natural Perfect and Living Spirit, I'd take Living Spirit for PVE any day.  Like I said, your regen is already going to be horrible.  You're using a PVP set (no spirit) that is gemmed for spell crit (?!) and resilience ...<br />
<br />
Also, you want to heal with HoTs but you insist on Nature's Grace and haven't maxed Empowered Rejuvenation ...<br />
<br />
I think your spec needs an overhaul if you're going to PVE heal in end-game ... aim for 41, 45, or 48 points in resto.</div></div><hr />

I can't see any use for it outside of pvp, or possible a wee boost to complementary balance talents.  <br />
<br />
I've always looked at NP and thought Blizzard must've lost their minds when they put it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadë</div><div class="date">04-22-2008, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I went into Heroic BF yesterday,and did quite well. You guys are right, my mana regen is attrocious. This hurt on the 2nd boss where you have to fight all the adds first, then the boss, but didn't really present a problem elsewhere. Admittedly BF is the easiest of heroics, or so I've been told, but as compared to Ramparts (the only other heroic I've been in), I have to agree. I did lose Omen of Clarity as I agree, there was very little benefit to having that, and instead put that point into subtley, but otherwise kept it the same.<br />
<br />
So, for me right now this is working out well. As soon as I have better gear, I will rethink ToL. Thank you all for your comments and advice!<br />

The boss fights are straight forward, nothing really odd.  And they are not long at all (less than 2 minutes each).  4 easy badges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You say your mana regen sucks, but you don't quite feel like taking Tree of Life.<br />
<br />
Tree of life isn't only about the healing bonus from spirit; that's a benefit.<br />
<br />
Tree of Life's real benefit is in the HoT cost reduction. If you were in Tree of Life, your HoTs would cost less, and they'd also heal for more by default due to having more points in Empowered Rejuvenation (which is one of the best talents in the resto tree).<br />
<br />
Might I make a suggestion? Sometimes I help my old guild out and join them for a few raids in BT/Hyjal as a resto druid (was originally a feral MT for them).<br />
<br />
I use this spec when I do so: http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0tcrzbZZxMIxcq0est (Note: If you want to focus more on PvP, I'd move 5 into Furor and 2 into Improved Mark of the Wild, leaving 0 in Nature's Focus)<br />
<br />
Nature's Grace won't help you on healing as much as better HoTs will. You can do just fine with Rejuvenation and Lifebloom, and Swiftmend.<br />
<br />
I've always looked at NP and thought Blizzard must've lost their minds when they put it in.<br />
<br />
I love Natural Perfection. But then again, I mostly do arena, so that might be it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's just my suggestion on the spec. Heck, I use 13/11/37 for PvP, and I heal heroics without any trouble. /shrug.<br />
<br />
<br />
One other thing... I caught this before I submitted the post. Here's a good PvP/PvE spec, with good damage:<br />
<br />
http://wowhead.com/?talent=0tjMzbIsMuZZVMIxcq<br />
<br />
Still heals with HoTs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fadë, if you want more flexibility in your spec, you have to work on collecting some better gear.  IMO most of us could easily dump ToL in 2.4 and be fine on mana (if only there was something else to actually put that point into).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The OP said he does very minor PVP so I was trying to help him with his PVE spec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadë</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, my gear is 'teh suck' and that is something I'm working on, however the gear I listed is 300% better than the gear I had from PVE quests, drops and environment post-BC. What I mean is that between armor and resilliance, I survive being hit long enough to bear and/or have a tank pull agro off me. <br />
<br />
I used to have a mix of wildheart and cenarion, neither it nor my random &quot;better&quot; armor cut it in heroics. I was being one-shotted left and right, wiping the group despite my healing. <br />
<br />
With my current armor set, spirit is VERY low despite all the best enchants and gems I could find, and ToL bonus give me next to nothing. I get more bonus on my heals via +int through Lunar guidance with my current gear. Yeah ToL reduces the costs of HoT spells, but I'm finding that after most encounters (so far) I'm still not using that much mana. It's in the extended fights or continueous fights that I do wear down some and find innervate or mana pots needful things.<br />
So with this spec, I'm maximizing my healing for the gear I have working towards the gear I need to make ToL viable for me. <br />
