Right now I only got a ZXR 400 (its hard to find good bikes in Japan, ironic eh).  In a couple months though I'm going back to the states to visit family and I fully intend to put down on a Ninja 1200.  Hayabusa are nice too but I've always had a thing for Ninjas.</div></div><hr />

Its a 2 1/2 hour ride out to the country where I can open it up a bit.  But still even there the most you can really get out of it is about 140 kph before you run into traffic or whatever.  <br />
<br />
On another note, have any of you looked in this months issue of Street Fighter magazine?  There got a wicked custom Hayabusa chopper.  That thing is wicked, rivalling stuff of Jesse James.</div></div><hr />

I will be heading off to the Blessing of the Bikes this weekend up at Colebrook, NH - we had Bike week this past weekend.<br />

One of the sites that support our little world here is: www.ducatinaults.com <br />

When I graduate Ninja Sportsbike Self Learning School.. I will possibly buy a Ducati.. tho I don't know yet.. there is some really nice bikes out there and Ducati just .. well I just don't want to say.. yet!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's funny cuz in the past 2 years the Ninja has won the performance ratings against the other 3 major sportbikes in both the 600 and 1k divisions.<br />
<br />
Though GSX-R is a more comfortable bike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most important part of your post right there.  If youre having fun, then those naysayers can go screw.  I personally have been riding HD's for about 15 years now...but I have many a friend who rides rockets.  More power to them.  The key is to have fun...thats what it is all about.</div></div><hr />

I would say comments like that comes solely from people I consider &quot;non-bikers&quot; &quot;posers&quot;<br />
<br />
I ride, often, to the tune of 20,000 miles yearly and have done so since my first machine @16 (LOL, that's alot of years, as that was a  long time ago)<br />
<br />
My stable includes my 1100 spirit, a 535 virago (girls bike?) an XS 650 (classic, but girl's bike to some) and my IT 200 (girls bike, which LOL, placed 8th in the open class state Hare scrambles against a field of 55 &quot;manly&quot; machines :P  Inthe past I've stabled an FLT, a Sturgis, a R65LS, an FLH sidecar rig, and a KLR250, think that qualifies me to some point on &quot;girls machines&quot;<br />
<br />
I enjoy all my machines, have every machine I've owned.  RUBS and Posers can just go polish or something LOL, really glad your having fun on your, what? 60hp machine? LOL, doesn't sound much like a girls bike from that standpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">06-24-2005, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mazikeen, as I read your post I couldn't help but think of an onboard vid from an amateur track in West VA.  It showed a 125 work an R1 with superior corner speed.  The rider (my commander's bro) really knew how to run his machine.  <br />
<br />
I never understood the macho-ism that comes from some people.  The group I ride with is a grand mix of Ninja, R1's, and Harleys.  We all have fun together no matter what we're riding.  Its just enjoying the ride.  <br />
<br />
Personally I like cruisers because of the relaxing ride.  You can sit back into the seat, enjoy the view (I love how much you can see on a bike than a car).  On the other hand, when I want to go rip the street, I love to ride a sportbike.  Its just fun to go through the twisties.  I think the way they lean and turn, the way they balance and roll through is beautiful.  <br />
<br />
My next bike I want is a ninja 12.  But I'd love to have a harley.  The problem is in their customer agreements.  There is only one lisenced Harley dealer/workcenter for about 800 miles where I live.  Needless to say it can make things pretty difficult.  Not to mention bikes in Japan are expensive, and Harley is just...OMG.  I just can't get one here.  The base exchange is ok, though now big bikes aren't allowed anymore.  So you can get Sportsters, but no Deuc or Softtails.  And an 883 Sport runs around $12K (no crome or custom).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobe Silvertree</div><div class="date">06-27-2005, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As mention in a previous post.. I was heading off for the &quot;Blessing of the Bikes&quot; this past weekend..<br />
<br />
I got back last night.. I am a hurting unit - did a 175 mile run back after a long weekend of partying.. basically its tent city and the bands come up for the Saturday night drunk fest. Fire Works and Cannons going off all weekend. The weekend was hot, 95-100 degrees; Thurs - Sunday and very clear weather. I sat in the River for around 2 hours trying to cool off. The usual streaker that runs thru the campgrounds and lots and lots of women showing off this years line of implants and ala natures blessings.<br />
<br />
I had my first run thru the Notch (scared the begesus out of me when we went down one of those nasty steep and very twisty roads in formation) but it was all good. Hit the waterfalls and the lakes.. love New Hampshire.<br />
<br />
Got my pin... had last years to but didn't have a bike last year.. I think the most memorable moment was when the priest has everyone start there engines at the Lady of the Shrine... its quite the experience with over 2000 bikes starting all at once.. every make and model. <br />
<br />
And yes.. a lot of bikers wanted to get on the Zoom-Splat (My Ninja) and take if for a ride.. they all came back smiling so it was all good.</div></div><hr />
