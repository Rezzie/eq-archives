<br />
I have played EverQuest from 1999 until 2004. Then I took a one  year break to try out EQ2 and WoW. (Both boring imho). I just returned and I almost feel like a newbie again! Veteran Newbie?<br />
I have so many questions and I'm sure I'll find the answer to a lot of them while surfing around at The Druids Grove. But I am so at loss atm and need a push as to where to start.<br />
<br />
Anyhows... I hardly played GoD and I also just bought OoW and DoN. I'm level 65 and just before my break I spent most time in BoT, PoV and PoN.<br />
<br />
So where do I start now? I managed to find the guild hall in PoK after I was slain in Firiona Vie. (Dark Elves took over? lol)<br />
<br />
Are there any new spells for me to get or do I need to level to 66 first?<br />
Do I buy the new spells? Quest for them?<br />
<br />
Should I hunt any special place for new armor from the latest expansions?<br />
(I currently have armor pieces from LDoN. See my magelo).<br />
<br />
A good place to play solo? (Kiting, Root/Dotting. I'm not much into pet-charming)<br />
A good place to duo with my SK partner?<br />
A good place to group?<br />
<br />
Anything else important happened that I should know about? (Plowing through lots of new lore atm).<br />
<br />
Help this lost druid of old to get a fresh start again! :wavey:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome back to Norrath/AB! Greetings to the ogre aswell ;-)<br />
<br />
No new spells that i know of (except you want to buy the DoN snare - bought with crystals (the DoN points), it's level 61 and has prismatic resist check) before lvl 66.<br />
After you dinged, you need to trade in different kind of muramite runes for the 66+ spells (described here: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2927). The 66-68 ones are droppable and can be bought in baz, the 69/70 ones are no drop and need you to hunt in higher OoW zones. The runes can drop from nameds in nearly any OoW zone, besides Harbringer's, Dranik's Scar and Bloodfields.<br />
<br />
Look at this thread for where to hunt: http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=11794 (first post mentions Noble's Causeway and the trashdrops you can get there), and this one: http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=8276 is a nice DoN primer. DoN is nice to group in, to get crystals to buy some augments and gear.<br />
<br />
Hope this helped a bit,<br />
<br />
Cya online hopefully!<br />

Thanks Darwa and vestix. This will certainly get me started in the new hunting areas.</div></div><hr />
