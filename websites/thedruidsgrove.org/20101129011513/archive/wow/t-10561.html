I don't know if it's real or not but if it is... wow! (lol.. no pun intended...) Though, I think I'd be more excited if the warcraft story line was to be adapted into a movie.  There were some great cut scenes in WC3 that could be great inspiration for movie ideas (the scene when Arthas goes back home and kills his father anyone?)  or even mini-cut scenes (like when Arthas turns Sylvannas into a banshee?)<br />
<br />
what do you guys think? :)</div></div><hr />

To each their own huh. :]<br />
<br />
I would prefer an animated version of WoW: the movie, over live action.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">05-10-2006, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Resident Evil was pretty good imo. AvP was a movie based off a video game made about a movie, dunno if there is a comparison there but I thought it was somewhat interesting. Haven't seen any of the other movies. <br />
<br />
What about Moral Kombat, Double Dragon, Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter zomg! And how could one possibly forget the Tomb Raider series....<br />
<br />
Peter Jackson is making an adaptation of Halo as well. I think the difference here is that Blizzard has a very rich and storied world they have created whereas some of these other movies were rather one dimensional. Given what has been shown to be possible with the recent King Kong movie this has some incredible potential.</div></div><hr />

:iamwithst <br />
<br />
Now moviegoers will be the next target to join our world...<br />
<br />
Anyways. I guess it depends on how they try to present this as a movie. Surely if they put a storyline with the lore it couldn't be that bad although I'm sure it won't appeal to all audiences. We'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yrys is going to close this thread anytime soon I bet lol... <br />
<br />
Anyway, hopefully the movie will be a quality piece of work.  I haven't seen Batman Begins but I heard it was really well done and Superman looks very interesting as well!  I will try NOT to think of the Street Fighter, Super Mario Bros, etc, classics.. though I didn't think Mortal Combat was that bad (compared to the movies that were out at that time) lol :P.  I really liked the Final Fantasy movies (Spirits Within and Advent Children), so I haven't lost all my faith in video game movies. <br />
<br />
What I'd really like to see is a) the movie done with computer graphics instead of real life actors and b) a &quot;Scary Movie&quot;-esque movie coming out afterwards based on the adventures of WoW :P  It wouldn't even have to be a separate movie.. Maybe even a short film of cut scenes and parodies that can be included in the DVD release would work too.  There are just TOO many classic comical moments that probably won't fit with the actual movie, but deserve attention nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

what was wrong w/ AVP?  I thought it was good for the storytime allowed....they just need to continue it (w/o humans possibly)</div></div><hr />

ps. I hope that weekend the server lag clears up a bit. I'm staying home. :)</div></div><hr />
