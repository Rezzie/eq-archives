<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">12-15-2008, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I may be way off on my math, but here's what I'm looking at.<br />
<br />
Staff of Trickery<br />
DPS = 186.5<br />
AGI = 89 = ~1% crit (like 1.1, but who's counting) = 89 AP<br />
AP Bonus = 180<br />
STA = 133<br />
<br />
Overall AP Bonus = 269 AP bonus<br />
<br />
Titansteel Destroyer<br />
DPS = 186.5<br />
STR = 124 = 248 AP<br />
STA = 105<br />
Hit Rating = 54<br />
<br />
Overall AP bonus = 248<br />
<br />
So overall the staff wins on HP as well as AP bonus.  The AP bonus is marginal at best.  What I find interesting is that even though you lose 1% crit on the Titansteel destroyer you might see a good bump in the DPS just by adding 54 Hit Rating if you aren't near the cap.  (Which seems to be sorely lacking on rogue gear oddly...)</div></div><hr />

Why?  Rogues always attack from the back, and have a crazy high hit cap.<br />
<br />
Did they change some rogue mechanics?</div></div><hr />

But their yellow damage cap is still only like 278 I think.</div></div><hr />
