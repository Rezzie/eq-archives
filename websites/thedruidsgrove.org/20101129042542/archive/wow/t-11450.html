They nerfed are aggro gain skills, Blizzard you are the Horses ass!<br />
I'm a main tank and we do AQ40, Naxx... and I need to be able to grab aggro and keep it!<br />
<br />
How do you all feel about this?<br />

<br />
While I would have preferred a buff to warriors, I can see where these were needed.  I don't see you having lost the ability to hold aggro or Blizz nerfing us to where we are no longer viable tanks at all.</div></div><hr />

I personally am not a bear tank in end game raids but from what I understand (which isn't a lot mind you) is that we were normalized to come in line with the warriors 'nerfs / normalization' a couple weeks / month back.</div></div><hr />

... they nerfed OUR aggro gain ....<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now that we have spelling / grammar out of the way.<br />
<br />
The game must remain in balance.  Some skill should still be required IMO.  We can still tank just fine.  Holding aggro shouldn't be a problem at all if you are with a group that knows what its doing.</div></div><hr />

Hell lets go one further and remove balance and feral trees. Lets go even further and rename druid to that class that has to heal even though they can do other stuff or priest you can go shadow, we will take over tyvm!! Maybe give us some form of shackle animal (oops got that) and maybe some protection buff (got that too). Wait, I know .... give us the ability to make water,open portals,make health stones and summon people. Well im spent.</div></div><hr />
