Tankspot and EJ both have them but its all i213 stuff.  <br />

If you have questions about specific slot, I would be happy to point you the right direction or explain the thinking/conventional wisdom.  <br />
<br />
For the most part, just take the highest iLvL you can get your hands on for AP Leather, then gem/enchant for EH (stam &gt; agi in gear +i226).<br />
<br />
The &quot;jewelry&quot; slots are a much more gray area.  Depending on content, you will need to swap out your trinkets pretty regualarly.  I typically run with one EH trinket, and one Mit/Avoidance trinket.  <br />
<br />
In TotGC, I have to slap on two stam trinkets in an effort to buy my healers more time.  <br />

(I logged out in my Bear stuff last night, so the armory should be correct, for today at least)</div></div><hr />
