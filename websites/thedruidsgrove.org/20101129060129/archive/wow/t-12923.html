<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">10-18-2008, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, so after choosing my spec (i opted out of any tanking talents besides thick hide) and giving up rend and tear and berzerk in favor of going deep enough into the resto tree for OoC and Master Shapeshifter, my chance to crit is right around 52%... happy with that, i proceeded to queue in to AB...<br />
<br />
first thing i come across is a ret pally... and i got pwned... i heard that ret pallies were kind of a nightmare at 70 and that we'll scale to them at 80... ok, let me walk that off... look! there's a rogue! pwned again (quickly)... man! rogues are hitting prety damn hard now, too... look! there's a squishy warlock! pwned pwned pwned... WTF is going on around here?!?!?! im over 50% chance to crit!<br />
<br />
i went from scoring a pretty consistant 3rd in KB's (with the damage numbers to go along with that) to the bottom of the charts...<br />
<br />
im at work, so i can't really remember my spec, and the armory isn't working correctly yet, but it's something like this:<br />

<br />
which i thought would be a decent PvP/dps spec<br />
<br />
am i completely off?<br />

*edit* fixed link to the right build</div></div><hr />

You need to talent FB and R &amp; T to have a prayer in pvp at 70.  Take six of those points out of resto and move them to feral.  More later, sorry I'm out of time!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liketheir build much better than what you had but i have a few personal preferences that differed, in the resto tree I'd switch shapeshifter to naturalist, reason being LOTP now gives an increased mana regen effect so mana isn't a problem ever; in contrast 6% damage to all attacks is decent. my other comment is very much opinion but I like brutal impact/ and SI instead of primal tenacity. However I might try their build this week because currently stunlock rogues are where I loose and that 30% damage reduction might be awesome. I'll miss Brutal impact though because it makes raping casters that much nicer (time for one more attack before they blink). And finally i can't figure out what they put the points into instead but shredding attacks is vital under the new system. Shred gets buffed 30% from mangle; 20% from bleed effects and 20% on stunned targets (glyph). so an extra 70% on shred with reduced energy cost (42 energy reg, 21 in berserk) is vicious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, PvP is really weird right now.  If you can sneak up on a Warlock, they are currently the squishiest class in the game.  If he gets all his DoT's on you, you're screwed.  But if you can Pounce and get a couple shreds off, wait out the death coil, trinket the first fear and kitty pounce back on for another quick cp's then 5pt FB, you'll most likeley win.  Then have to shift out and heal like crazy so you dont die from dots...<br />
 <br />
Warriors are really easy to take down now.  Ret Pallies (though they just got nerfed a little bit), Rogues and Frost Mages are just wtf over the top.  It's literally a whole new game in PvP right now - back to the instagib pre bc style.<br />
 <br />
time for one more attack before they blink. <br />
 <br />
Just FYI - Mages can blink while stunned.  Which is just one more reason that Frost Mages are stupid hard to kill.  Deep Freeze (stuns a Frozen target for 5 sec, 30 sec CD) is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah i was going to clarify that point originally but opted out because i wanted to keep the post short. I was aware pre 3.0.2 that blink was usable in stun but it really seems in the new patch its not. Maybe with the patch i'm just facing alot of newb mages but i've noticed they haven't been blinking till after stun. My thinking was that it was nerfed, but if thats true I'm sure rogues would be too OP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The damage reduction on Primal Tenacity is the only thing that keeps me from being instagibbed by stealthers every time.  As it is I only survive maybe a third of the time, and if it's a rogue duo or rogue/warrior combo it's all over regardless.  I have 331 resil.<br />
<br />
I passed on SA because Rake is good enough with Berserk and there is no positional requirement.<br />
<br />
High resil warriors are painful; their stuns and crit resistance makes for a tough fight.  Maybe if I could War Stomp in forms...but every time I have to put myself in caster form I might as well just sit down and wait to die.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Ghostcrawler has said plainly that the classes are not balanced; it's one of the reasons for the major pve nerf.  The design intent is for classes to be balanced at 80.  They also admit they've got a ways to go to get pvp balanced, so my guess is that we have several months of painful waiting before feral is truly competetive in pvp.</div></div><hr />
