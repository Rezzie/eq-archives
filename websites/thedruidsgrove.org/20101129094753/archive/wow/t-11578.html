I haven't personally evaluated them though.... I'll get a LW up to 375 just for giggles.  I'm just that kind of player.</div></div><hr />

It really is a good set and allows you to have that extra plus healing if you need to heal in an emergency. <br />

LW has some really great recipes, i've made quite a bit of money crafting the epic ones that require nethers. Also once you get to the eye there are some awesome belt and boot recipes in there for LWing. I recently got http://wowhead.com/?item=30303 and am crafting this for the guild.<br />

there is also: <br />

the boots are all BOP when made but there are two leather ones which are pretty tasty for feral :)<br />

I'd say BC leatherworking is better than old game LWing. Except ofc there is no HOTW :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
the clefthoof set alone is the best non raid/heroic drops out there for tanking.  and some fo the DPS BoP items are alot better then whats out there</div></div><hr />
