<br />
right ...<br />
<br />
Apparently parental hysteria has led to terminal governmental hysteria.<br />
And somewhere and somewhen a clause has slipped in that prohibits the use of common sense.<br />

Heinlein, among many authors who wrote about future societies lacking common sense, labeled his Future History society's time period like this, &quot;The Crazy Years&quot;.<br />
<br />
There is a great tendency to blame the  &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;Political Correctness&quot; for this kind of garbage.  This just is the normal &quot;blame liberals for everything&quot; garbage.  All &quot;advanced&quot; societies seem to have this kind of crazy stuff.  By advanced, I just mean a government more complex than tribal level.<br />
<br />
A look at history shows this is nothing new.  Attitudes about all kinds of things, especially sex and drugs during &quot;modern&quot; times, show an appalling lack of &quot;common sense&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just one example from history, the idea that because someone is Jewish, that they &quot;killed Christ&quot;, is mind boggling.  Because some Jewish leaders might have told the Roman authorities to have Christ killed has nothing to do with people who weren't even born at the time...</div></div><hr />
