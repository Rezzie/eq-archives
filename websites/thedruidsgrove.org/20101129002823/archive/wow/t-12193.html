<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wondergiraff</div><div class="date">11-13-2007, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the attempt to maximize my DPS for raids I've begun toying with stopcasting macros and the like (although Bliz says such will not be necessary any more with this new patch). However, my question is about using items. I've got a macro set up where it refreshes IS and MF, while also activating my trinkets whenever they are up, and I'm wondering if there is a way to add Drums of Battle on to that string (especially now that the cast time has been taken away, making it instant)? Adding it on just breaks the macro, causing nothing to be cast, or only Moonfire.<br />
<br />
I don't have the macro right now due to servers being down, but are there any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could use a cast sequence macro that would reset on the cooldown time of the trinket, that would be the easiest thing.</div></div><hr />

I can smack a trinket and cast something immediately after. It use to get me slightly confused as I was so use to having the GCD, I often waited and then realized &quot;oh yeah, I didn't need to.&quot;</div></div><hr />
