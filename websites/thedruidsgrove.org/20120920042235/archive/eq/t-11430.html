I'm a 4 year veteran of EQ, however I only got year one reward.<br />
Every day I type /veteran in hopes it will update but it does not.<br />
<br />
I petitioned but the reply I got said this problem is beyond the scope of a GM. I was told the issue was being passed along but, well, nada. I'm hoping next week when the new month comes and the system rechecks your vet status it will be updated.<br />
<br />
I'm curious how many others are suffering fromn this and simmilar problerms with incorrect Vet Rewards still. Lets hear your story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm wondering if they are going to give those who bought the extra year after the original offer expired the extra aa too and if so when.</div></div><hr />

The explanation of Vet rewards ( and mind you, this is merely from memory of something I read on the main Sony boards ) is that they are recalculated monthly and they are calculated based on projecting to the end of the current period for which the member has paid. Assuming that this is true, the extra year gained from the extra year purchased is automatic and not a special deal. Based on this, the year Vet bonus is available last month, right now, a week from thursday and next June etc.</div></div><hr />
