<br />
I try to find a build Feral/Resto.<br />
<br />
I would like to find a template allowing me to be a good Healer, but also of being able to tank if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thank's</div></div><hr />

That build is centered around Heart of the Wild in the Feral tree (useful for tanking and healing) and focuses on Healing Touch in the Resto tree. It also gives you Swiftmend and Nature's Swiftness, both very useful.<br />
<br />
You should know that you will be lacking some important tools for tanking (mangle, 3% crit reduction, Leader of the Pack,...) as well as important stuff for Healing (better HoTs, threat reduction, spell interrupt protection, ...).<br />
<br />
Good equipment can make up for some of that missing talents/abilities, but still you will not be as good a tank or healer as an equally equipped druid/priest/warrior/pala.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">04-11-2007, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... going for 41 points in Resto will give you very good healing abilities, but tanking will be very difficult. An example for the build you want would be 0/19/41 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zZxhhsbbZVtczeqMcot). You have one point left, put it anywhere.<br />
<br />
But you should consider that you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. If you want 41 points in resto there is not enough left for a good tanking build. With so few points left I'd rather put them into the balance tree for good caster damage (also nice because you can do moderate damage when you have a few moments where no heal is needed): 20/0/41 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xcrziZZVtczeqMcot). Or I would go for kitty DPS 0/20/41 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zZxGMsbbZVtczeqMcot).<br />
Another choice would be to simply go full Resto: 0/0/61 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MZZEEcxeqreot)<br />
<br />
But essentially with 41 points in Resto you will not be able to fulfill other roles very well. With good gear it would be enough for 5-mans but in heroics or raids you will only be useful as healer.</div></div><hr />

Find where you want your resto points and then put the rest into balance for more damage than you'd get out of feral.  Without some key feral talents, tanking would be VERY difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you pvp at all, 11 in feral for feral charge is nice AND 8 in balance for 100% interruption free cyclones helps as well.<br />
<br />
That's a good place to spend 19 of those 20.</div></div><hr />
