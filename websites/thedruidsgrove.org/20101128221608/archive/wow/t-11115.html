I have made him feral based now, but how does Moonkin grind as well?</div></div><hr />

Not necessarily just because you are moonkin doesn't mean you have to stay there teh whole time. When you get low on mana shift to feral and continue grinding.</div></div><hr />

Warriors do great physical damage, but have few options against high AC mobs.  If you go feral those troublesome mobs will probably do too much damage to stay in the relatively more squishy cat form, so you will end up in bear, doing more or less what you would have done on your warrior, but with fewer melee abilities.<br />
<br />
With a moonkin however, you would still have the warrior level AC for protection, but you would be doing spell damage, which  isn't mitigated by AC.</div></div><hr />

When you get the right gear and skill you can safely farm Tyr's Hand with no downtime whatsoever (yes I farm em in catform only).<br />
<br />
Rogues with C'Thun dagger and Wars with Dark Edge will have more downtime than you, promise. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grind in cat/bear, when you're at a hp% where you know you might not kill the next mob (see how much dmg you take per mob), shift out heal, shift back and you're mana regen will bring you to full mana each time and if you were 0/30/21 like I was, you could use shift, NS HT, shift back and the CD would be done.</div></div><hr />

But, if you like me, you'll like Moonkin. :&gt; I like grinding via spell casting; I like how if I'm outside, I can roots and kill em' before they get to me. <br />
<br />
I like casting. :&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the expansion talents encouraging melee, well if the gear compliments it like some of the posts have been saying it could be semi-viable.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even full feral and my grinding is much better. 0/20/31 btw.<br />
<br />
I was fairly good when I was a moonkin grinding. I had it down. But what was killing me was mana and badages. I would go through 4-5 mobs and then I would have to bandage then drink. That's money out of my pocket. : ) <br />
<br />
Now I'll go through 4-5 mobs, pop out of kitty hit NS-Heal, then back to killing. I've even tried lately poping out real quick and throwing down a Rejuvenation, then go into bear and Frenzied Regeneration my way up back to full health.<br />
