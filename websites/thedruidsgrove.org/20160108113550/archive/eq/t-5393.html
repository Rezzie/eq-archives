<br />
Select save and give it a name.<br />
<br />
1 saved (Vexthal) and counting...probably about 7 more line ups to go heh.<br />
<br />
Big wet sloppy kisses to SOE for this feature...it is even better than I had hoped, and one of those small things that dramatically improved my game exp.  I always hated the annoyance of rememming spells on death and now it is ...very very easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Mem the spell lineup you want<br />
2) Right click on spell book in your spell bar, it will bring down some options such as save spell lineup, delete spell lineup...in your case choose save spell lineup.<br />
3) A small window will pop up asking what you want to call that spell lineup. In my case I memed a soloing spell lineup. I simply named it &quot;Solo lineup&quot;. <br />
4) Now that you have named it, mem another spell lineup etc etc save it, name it and viola.<br />
<br />
To bring up your spell lineup, simply right click on spell book icon in your spell bar and choose which lineup you saved. Hope that helps. Sounds confusing, but actually quite simple once ya get the hang of it. Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

That reminds me that I need to make some additional sets, have like 7 or 8 so far, lol.    Like Raid - cold nukes, Raid - fire nukes, Raid - both nukes, Buffs, Normal XP, Charm XP, etc...</div></div><hr />

The UI is even smart enuf to not waste time rememming spells you already have memmed, and you can interrupt it simply by standing up.  I already have sets for:<br />
<br />
Travel <br />
Nuker<br />
back up healer<br />
Main Healer<br />
coh anchor<br />
buffer<br />
Solo Rot<br />
<br />
And more to come like after death!<br />
<br />
I was publicly hesitant about the new spell ui, but with the addition of the spell sets at the last minute, I've become a devotee.  I'm just afraid now that I'll get lazy about keeping my spell book organized.  :p <br />
<br />
I think of all classes, Druids will benefit the most by spell sets due to our versatility.  Can you tell I adore spell sets?  :)</div></div><hr />

They say animals don't worry <br />
You know animals are hairy? <br />
They think they know what's best <br />
They're making a fool of us <br />
They ought to be more careful <br />
They're setting a bad example <br />
They have untroubled lives <br />
They think everything's nice <br />
They like to laugh at people <br />
