<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenton</div><div class="date">08-16-2010, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard something in guild chat a couple of days ago, and wasn't able to follow up.  It sparked some questions in my mind about when to start collecting AA's. For background I tend to solo a lot, and do some grouping, and very very little raiding.  <br />
<br />
In guild chat they recommended postponing AA collection.  The statement was something along the line that killing an even con creature while lvl 61 would net a bigger percentage of an AA than killing an even con creature as a lvl 51 player.  <br />
<br />
AA's were a new concept last time I played so I haven't really done much with them.  (About all i have done so far is to max Innate Run Speed on my cleric so far.)<br />
<br />
My Druid is 62 at the moment and don't know that I could tell you that having no AA's is holding me back, YET!  I'm I missing anything here?  Are there AAs that are important to levelling for an ok equiped Druid?</div></div><hr />

I would recommend leveling first as the gear and spells will bring you much more power than the aas will. Plus AAs go a LOT faster now than they used to, especially at a low aa count.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The old theory was to get max level before AA'ing. WIth the revamp and the inflation on mob HP's that is no longer the case.<br />
 <br />
All I will say is that 62, 65, 70, 71, and 76 are sweet spots for AA'ing for a Druid. And because the class is so AA dependent, Grabbing AA's when the mobs have very few HP's is always an advantage.</div></div><hr />
