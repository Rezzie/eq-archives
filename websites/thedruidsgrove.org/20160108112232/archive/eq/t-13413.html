I have the note on me. I have tried invis, uninivis, alone in the zone, others in the zone, close to the druid circle at midnight, out of range of the druid circle at midnight, running around the druid circle for hours - waiting the entire in game 24 hours - zoning out after 3am in game and coming back at 10pm.<br />
 <br />
Any suggestions? I have sent a /bug report - but not sure it is really a bug. Maybe I am missing something?</div></div><hr />

Just stood on the hill they spawned at midnight.  Can't imagine what they did to SK, unless they added a monster mission there, but I don't keep track of that stuff to be honest.</div></div><hr />

The GM that came out said that all kinds of stuff was screwed up and thats probably the case here. Just keep /petitioning and send in bug reports and they should fix it eventually.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyre Wintermute</div><div class="date">03-03-2006, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Targetable traps is nuts!!  I did an LDoN Thursday night.. My GF's BL pet would not give up trying to kill the thing... she constantly had to call it back and fight the real mobs.  /rude sony.. (even though they did look neat)  And one other thing.... You could track the traps!?!  WTG<br />
<br />
As For Epic 1.5 woes..... Sounds alot like the inital problems we had when we were trying this quest.  Many had to evac a few minutes before the spawn time and then run to the hill.  I'm sure all of those posts are burried in that thread if it even exists anymore.. I know it got +28 pages to it by the time the 1st epic was complete..<br />
<br />
as for the BL 1.0... I've seen many of them up... just keep giving it a little time.  The first 3-4 days after PoR release, Sony was resetting the servers each morning PST... I know a BL that had been stuck on the final 1.0 mob for 6 months with no luck.. so might just be bad timing too, unless you're camping it 24/7 you never know when some BL twink/alt/friend of a lvl 70 toon will sneak in and destroy a 1.0 mob in about 3 mins.  I did My BL epic 1.0 in 8 hours start to finish minus the TD mob because I passed it to a guild who was actually at that stage of gearing their people.</div></div><hr />

I had same problem...and I don't know if you figured it out yet, but I tried and tried to con amiable and couldn't. Not just with Farios, but with some others in game without success. To work around this, I changed into wolf form and was able to complete those parts. Try doing this if you have not already.<br />

Just got my epic 1.0 on the 12th of March.<br />
