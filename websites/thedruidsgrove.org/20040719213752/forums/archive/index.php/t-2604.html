I'm slow getting exp, so it's not like I'm going to get 3 AA a day; if I were, I'd just go for whatever.<br />
<br />
I have: run 3, wis 3 (I really needed wis then), scm 3, innate camo, exodus, mgb, sotw 1, radiant cure 1.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm wavering about where to go next:<br />
<br />
sotw 2, 3<br />
mc 1<br />
rc 2 (3?)<br />
HA 1, 2, 3<br />
<br />
At this point, I'm probably looking at this order; I group, solo rarely, and raid casually.  (My guild does Luclin and some PoP content, so RC is helpful for curses and such.)<br />
<br />
At some point, I'd really like some eye candy.. crit nukes, crit heals, but they just don't seem as immediately helpful as some of the other stuff?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you group mostly, I really think sotw 3 is your best bet, after that I would say HG1 and then start on HA.  This is all assuming that you primarily heal in groups.  I say HG1 first because its cheap and fun and sometimes (although rarely) it makes a difference.  HA is better in the long run because you can count on bigger heals consistently.<br />
<br />
All this is my own 2cp though.  Sometimes I do things out of the order I have set for myself merely because it is fun.  Eventually you will have all the basic AA you want. So, I think its ok to have a rough idea but to give yourself permission to have fun with it.  It was very satisfying to see the eye candy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matafleur Mistwalker</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would finish off SOTW, it's one of my favourite AA's and can help save a group if you need some fast group healing.<br />
<br />
After that, I would probably go for HA and HG because anything which improves your heals is great.<br />
<br />
If you want a bit of fun, I would then look at the crit nuke AA's and WoTW because 650 points of DS every 4 minutes is fun fun fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing gift is fine but even with HG 3 I don't crit all that much. On top of that it only works on patch heals so you get more bang for your aa out of HA rather than HG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SCF1 is only 2 AA.  If you want it get it.  It won't significantly delay your advancement in other areas.  And it's not a bad thing to have anyway.  The same goes for HG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqduffer</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) mc1 -- good bang for the buck<br />
2) ha1-3 -- more useful than sotw 2/3 imho<br />
3) sotw2-3 -- the extra healing is nice .. not above ha though<br />
4) scf1-3 -- eye candy<br />
<br />
mc1 is a good buy, for a stackable FT1.  HA is a nice boost to heals, and if you're grouping all the time as primary healer, is good.<br />
<br />
I doubt you'll notice many situations where the extra 50hp/tick (250hp total without scrm?) for sotw3 over sotw1 will buy you all that much, so I'd go HA3 over sotw3.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't bother getting scf1.  Sure you might crit once in a great while, but unlike MC, scf gets CHEAPER as you increase in levels.  So scf3 gets you a far greater % damage increase per point spent than scf1 or scf2.  I wouldn't buy scf1 until you're working all the way up to scf3.<br />
<br />
IMHO at least. =)  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you think you'd use Dire Charm or Mass Group Buff?  DC is great fun in many zones, and adds respectable damage to xp groups.  MGB coupled with SotW works wonders in AE fights, and can help keep things under control if adds show up or a tank goes down.<br />
<br />
If I were you I'd start with MC1, and consider MC2.  After that, think about DC and MGB.  If neither of those appeal to you, HA or SCF are good choices too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noliniel</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO you should go SCF3, HA 3, ND 3, MC 1, RC 3 if you can. Sotw 1 and sotw 3 don't make muh differences. This way you do more damage on nukes ( if you crit that is ), Heal more, more HP for you, +1 tick mana regen and able to cure more. Really useful no matter you solo/group/raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilleyEskimo</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was planning out my AAs, I had a definate plan that I worked toward.  I made a list of the skills I wanted and skills that would be helpful to my guild.  I further broke the list down into helpful to me and helpful to others.  Using that breakdown, I prioritized and completed AA skills in an order that satisfied my needs for soloing, grouping, and raiding.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't change a thing about my AA order and choices.  It's made my character very powerful in the areas I play the most.  Research definately pays off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logilitie</div><div class="date">08-12-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">get to sotw 3, mc1 cheap enough ( no higher )<br />
HA 1, HG 1 ( if i wanted to be a cleric.. )<br />
personally i chose SCF 3 and FoM .. i'm a battle druid and enjoy the crits.. ( still about 1 in 10.. with FoM 1 )<br />
<br />
Radiant cure for raids. ( otherwise pretty useless )<br />
<br />
been thinking about channeling focus. ( just REALLY hate interupts.. i'm usually pulling and seem to not be fully stopped when i start casting ) maybe quick dmg would be better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaggleHappyfeet</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hagglethorn here from Prexus Aquilas.  Having looked at your aas I would personally recommend mc1 first its very worth the 2 points and then healing adept if you mostly use our cheal line or healing gift if you find you use natures infusion more often.    As others have said the points for scf get more valuable the more you spend so its really not worth putting any points into unless your gonna go all the way and spend all 12 imo.   <br />
<br />
Also if you xp alot dire charm is useable and probably doubles if not more so your damage output in the following zones:  crypt of decay, valor(if you can find a small green frog !), halls of honor(young wrulons), tactics(young war boar), plane of elemental earth(mini armadillos), chardoka (chokidai sniffers) .    As you can see there are a number of zones where dire charm will significantly increase your damage output.  If your in a nuking role you probably double if not close to triple your damage or you can use your dc pet and do good damage and STILL be primary healer.   I know others dont think of highly of it as I do but for helping generate more aas very few other aas will help as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aquila, I'd go for MC1, SoTW3, SCF3, FoM3, HA3 and then re-evaluate my destination.<br />
<br />
SoTW3 is the final stage of the druid group heal.  On big pulls its frequently the only thing between living and dying.  Your AC jumps up, your DPS jumps up, and your entire party regens 250hp/tick for about a minute depending on your AA's and gear.  That mob cast an AE nuke?  This is your AE heal.  You can really feel the power of this AA fighting a mob like Aerian Darr (sp?) in PoValor with a raid.  Position yourself in the pile of waiting melee's and hit this with MGB as the first AE goes off.  You just healed the entire raid for that event.  Sure you mostly group, but AD is a raid mob a lot of grouping people have done...<br />
<br />
RC3 the final stage of our group cure.  RC1 worked just as well.  Spotty piece of crap skill I'd like a refund on.  Pureblood and RGC/RC all the way.<br />
<br />
MC2, MC3 This increases your ability to handle pulls by nuking, dotting or healing.  Oh joy, sure it takes 2 more points of mental clarity 200 ticks to get that next nukes worth of mana up.  It reduces rebuff time and works pretty good on corpse runs.  This is a priority after you get your 15 points of flowing thought gear.<br />
<br />
SCF3/FoM3 Having to do this over, I wouldn't have gone past FoM1.  SCF3 though is important,  you'll crit approximately 7 percent of the time and there's always damage to be done so you make use of it.  I prefer this one of the crit healing AA because its so much more effictive. With FoM3 I crit about 13 percent of the time.  This equates 1 crit every 7 nukes.  Or in a bad situation about 370 mana free every 10 ticks or FT 37ish.  (370 mana for a nuke, 8.5 second cycle time * 7 nukes = 60 seconds or 10 ticks)  Sure that doesn't include SCM3, Specializing, or MP4, but its a starting point.  (those all reduce the FT#,  to say FT20ish,  still a friggin bargain)<br />
<br />
HA3 Percentage heal increase, this is a good AA.  I did it later, after ND3/CA3 and LR5.  I felt after finishing off FoM3, I needed more survivability in POP.<br />
<br />
ND3 Increases your hp.  This is a raiding druids AA to me.  A grouping druid will hit evac rather than stand and take it.  If your not raiding that extra 150hp or so you gain is not worth it.<br />
<br />
HG3 Critical Heals.  I'm about to buy the third rank of this to finish off all my archetypes.  I quite honestly, do not like this AA.  Why?  Player Characters have less hp than NPC's.  I see your toon get about 2k in damage I'm hitting natures infustion, your healed.  If it crits, that extra is lost.  Most toons you can't wait until they need 4k in a heal as their in the bloodlust range then.  This AA really could use some improvement, IE a hp check to see if the target needs a 4k heal and double the percentage chance it'll fire.  But NOOOOOOOO.  Lets make it lame and random it when they only need a 500 hp heal.  I can count the number of times on one hand a crit heal saved mana in the last 2 months let alone prevented a wipe.<br />
<br />
Planar Power/Innate Enlightenment - These two skills increase your hp, defense skills, and mana pool.   The decision between them is easy.  Look at your stats.  If more than your wisdom is maxed out when you have your typical buff stack, go Planar Power.  It will increase your survability with more hp, agility, dexterity.  If your wisdom is the only one capped, go Innate Enlightenment.  Every point of Planar Power = 5 wis or about 25 mana.  Every point of Innate enlightenment = 10 wis or about 50 mana.  Combined you get about 375 more mana, or a heal/nuke.<br />
<br />
Metabolism - This is an underated AA.  I routinely use stat food and forget to force feed myself.  Misty Thicket Picnics run like 8pp each on thule so I just spend the cash.  So this AA saves me cash.<br />
<br />
Nuke Haste - I already overaggro when nuking, doing it faster just means I die more.  This AA only saves like 10 percent of the casting time on slow nukes.  You can easily aquire 18 percent nuke haste in the bazaar and spend those AA's on something that is not storebought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">08-13-2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you easily get 18% nuke haste in the bazaar as a druid?  I don't see any tradeable Speed of Solusek items...<br />
<br />
Keep in mind spell haste from an item and spell haste from AA's stack.  Quick Damage is (slightly) more effective if you have a spell haste item already, because the percentages are of the base cast time.  (Taken to an extreme, ignoring caps: suppose you had 80% spell haste on an item, and you were casting a 10 second nuke.  Your cast time would be 2 seconds, plus the 2.25 sec recast time.  Quick Damage would take off another 10% of the base cast time of 10 seconds, for a resulting cast time of 1 second.  This lets you nuke 30% more often.)  That said, quick damage probably shouldn't be a priority.  I got mine around AA 300; doing it again, I might bump it up to 200 or so, but no further.<br />
<br />
For spirit of the wood, the gains between level 1 and level 3 aren't huge.  (Same goes for radiant cure.)  Level 1 is a top priority, but I'm not sure level 2 and 3 should be.<br />
<br />
As for ND3...maybe I'm in the minority here, but I made hp a very high priority soloing and grouped as well.  I guess it's largely because I spent a lot of time charming in both situations.  I bought ND3 pretty early on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29037 (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=29037)<br />
Ceramic Totem of Xegony,<br />
<br />
I believe it is, it may only be 15 percent spell haste.  But still the point is the same, you can buy it easy enough.  Not to mention where we really need the haste is on heals and cures.  Your comparing one lucky roll on an ornate armor in BoT to hours of grinding exp.  12 + AA's for 10 percent spell haste on nukes.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind also, spell casting haste does not work on anything under 3 seconds.  So stuns, snares, roots won't be affected.<br />
<br />
There also used to be a 10 second casting time cap on spell casting haste.  I'm not sure of the status of that, but it prevented anything taking 10 seconds or longer from not having its casting time modified.<br />
<br />
I did ND3 early as well.  I wanted the hp for raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Opivvy</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most important aa is SCM3, surprised no one mentioned it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laniris</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we seem to have to wandered off to a general discussion of AAs rather than a specific discussion of the original question, I'm going to throw something else out there.<br />
<br />
I'm newly 65 and doing the usual AA push--I split my time grouping and soloing with maybe one raid a week.  I'm currently run3, regen3, SCM2.  The strange thing about my position (or not so strange, but I haven't really heard anyone ask) is that while I'm one of 3 65 druids in my guild, I'm the only one that raids atm who's really doing AA, and I'd like to know what you all think would be the most helpful to a small guild.<br />
<br />
As a guild, we have 20ish 65s (not all of whom raid), and maybe 15 more 60+ with again as many 55+.  We're clearly more of a &quot;family&quot; guild, but even so we're pushing our way through whatever we can--hopefully soon we'll be able to take a serious shot at TT, we're getting people flagged for PoNb as we can.  My guildleader would love to see me pick up SotW (and MGB) asap, and I feel like that would be useful, but I'm still not sure exactly what would be the most useful.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I've now done sotw 2 and am working on sotw 3.  Then I'll do mc 1, and move on to HA, I think.<br />
<br />
I especially appreciate the help from Mata and Hagglethorn, being on my own server and having answered my tell questions in the past with generous kindness.<br />
<br />
Laniris, I think you're where I was a few AA ago.  I went SCM 3 for all the reasons people cite.  Then I did radiant cure 1 and sotw 1 to help more on raids.<br />
<br />
Do you have B9 yet?<br />
<br />
I don't, yet, so I got mgb for now, pretty much to use with sotw on raids; that means doing the third level of sotw before some other stuff makes sense for me.  (The lack of B9 also formed an excuse for not doing mgb very fast, though I did get to it.)<br />
<br />
If you have b9, I'd do:<br />
scm 3<br />
mgb<br />
sotw 1, 2, 3 in that order.<br />
<br />
If you don't have b9, then I'd do one level of sotw at least before mgb, so that you have something to mgb when you get it, AND you get the fun/help of sotw while your working there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Axercis</div><div class="date">08-14-2003, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd only get SotW3 first if my guild's primary focus is in PoP. It's a very nice ability and I have got all 3 levels myself but I find myself rarely using it outside of PoP encounters. I went with<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
IR3<br />
MC1<br />
SCM3<br />
HA1<br />
SCF1<br />
Exodus<br />
Innate Camo<br />
SotW1<br />
RC1<br />

From here back tracked to do more Arch AAs and to get my Elder title.<br />
<br />
MGB<br />
DC<br />
MC3<br />
SCF3<br />
IM1<br />
IE3<br />
FoM1<br />
SotW3<br />
HA3<br />
AHA2<br />
<br />
I am pretty happy with how I spent my AAs except 24 of them. If I had the chance to rearrange my AAs I'd probably skip DC and SCF/FoM until I finshed AHA3 and AHG3. I much rather spend AAs on SCRM to get my class title but that means I have to put 12 AAs into SCR3 first, DC seemed a lot more attractive comparing to Enhanced Root, Quick Damage, and Quick Evacuation. I used to nuke a lot and was evocation specialized until 65. I made the switch to alteration after that since NI and KR are both mana intensive, on top of that, by now wizard's nuking ability has far surpassed druid's. A wizard's unfocused max nuke does only a bit less than a druid's unfocused max crit, not to mention wizards have innate crit ability. To me better healing is the way to go, I play healer in both raid and xp group.</div></div><hr />

I had watched the bazaar pretty much daily for about 5 months, and saw it for sale once--for 125k.  It appeared to sell within a couple days.  A former guildmate told me he has sold several, for as much as 175k if I remember right.  I later managed to buy two sets of components for them (out of the 5 months or so I had been watching the bazaar), succeeded making both totems, kept the first and sold the second one for 100k.  The person who bought it said he had never seen any for sale before.<br />
<br />
I found it much easier to get 18 AA's (even if the end result isn't as good).<br />
<br />
In any case, the point is that they stack.  Regardless of the spell haste item you have (if any), you still benefit from the quick damage AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, market prices/availability vary a LOT from server to server.  Seventh Hammer has a horrible market compared to most others.  Anytime I see items mentioned here or on Steel Warrior/Monkly Business, I know I can multiply the prices mentioned by 2 or 3, and if it's a high end item, it most likely never or rarely appears in the Bazaar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HaggleHappyfeet</div><div class="date">08-16-2003, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To the person remarking that they didnt prioritize ND or healing crits I have to say I disagree pretty strongly.   I think depending on where your grouping/raiding and the hp levels of your group that crits start to become very useful.   I know that as someone who just got into time I buff up to almost 7k hits and most of the other casters are pretty close to me with our MA over 10k buffed and crits come in real handy in those first 10 seconds of a fight or so when the boss mob might quad for 3k and isnt slowed yet.   Admittedly in many xp group situations the crit is wasted, heck even on raids its often wasted BUT with maxed healing crits you crit 19% of the time and every once in a while your REALLY happy about critting that heal.  <br />
<br />
If your not too far into PoP I would probalby hold off on crits and buy nd3 first.   With nd3 I found I got alot more than 150 hps though.   And extra hps are helpful both raiding and grouping it lets you wait alil longer before having to heal yourself instead of your group if nothing else which can be useful.   Although I must agree with you that innate metabolism is pretty handy its one of the more underrated skills.<br />
