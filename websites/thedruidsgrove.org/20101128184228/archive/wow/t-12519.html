Sobe posted this over on the EQ forum (http://thedruidsgrove.org/eq/forums/showthread.php?t=16665) a couple weeks ago and I'm just reposting it here.  If you've donated recently and still don't have your supporter tag, please email Sobe at admin@thedruidsgrove.org with the information he requests below.<br />
Please send me emails and if you have already emailed me - please do again; my DNS wasn't fully changed over and I had my host file still pointed at the other server.<br />
<br />
Please include Username here. Paypal email addy; or just forward the reciept to me with your Username and I will upgrade your permissions. And if you have donated in the past and your not showing your tag; feel free to send me an email. Working around 10-12 hours a day right now and still trying to stay caught up.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
