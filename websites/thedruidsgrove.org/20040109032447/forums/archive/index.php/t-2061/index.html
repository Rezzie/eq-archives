<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently root-rotting or quadding mobs in tier 1 PoP that are level 57, so will soon be losing the XP bonus (once I ding 63).<br />
<br />
Any good suggestions for root-rot spots with mobs 58+?  I don't have the gear/skills for slam-kiting, never got good at charming, and can barely quad the mobs I fight now, so doubt I can quad mobs that are even higher in level.<br />
<br />
Just looking for some spots that I can quietly root-rot a mob or two, when waiting for guildies to log on, or to finish the mission they started before I logged on.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
PS - No PoP flags, so limited to 1st tier, CoD, PoV, PoS, PoTorment, BoT and HoH.  I know there are some good spots in HoH for root/rot, but have NO idea where they are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>duranstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">one of the easiest places to root dot in HoH is the graveyard.  pull with harmony and root dot in the gy.  But be careful as there will often be other groups/soloers agrokiting and such there also.<br />
<br />
another way to to go exploring.  There are basements that you can root dot in.  Not much sees invis (but con stuff as you run around).  Don't fight on the paths though, there are wandering named that can ruin your day.  so invis up and look around =)<br />
<br />
slam kiting is when you solo summoning mobs by keeping on the move, getting summoned, running away and doing whatever you need to to kill the mob.  It's called that cause every 18 seconds orwhatever, you slam into the mob =)  at least that's what i think it is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tier 1 until you get enough levels for PoV/PoS.  Once you are tier 2 enabled, then old skool snare/DoT kite.  You prolly won't have the manapool to straight up nuke kite just yet.<br />
<br />
I would suggest switching spec to conjuration (if evocation spec, leave alteration alone and just kill a little bit slower - alteration druids get more efficient exp grouping than soloing anyways).<br />
<br />
Don't worry about having to switch back to evoc for a while.  You will need a ton of exp before you an start nuke kiting again.  You'll need level 65, SCM3 (12aa), planar power (10aa), innate enlightenment (15aa) and, depending of wisdom from equipment, innate + advanced innate wisdom (15aa).  You will prolly want dire charm (9aa) as well for that extra dps pet.<br />
<br />
Once you get enough mana to nuke kite a mob down to 75% (with conj spec), then work on dire charm.  Switch back to evoc then DC/nuke kite the rest of your AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">By the bye, all KOS mobs in PoV won't summon (except for dragon).  Most non-KOS mobs in PoV will summon.  Some are unsnareable (some spiders, some undead and some centipedes - seems to be random if they spawn snareable or not).<br />
<br />
Only the forest frogs in PoS won't summon.  Everything else does.</div></div><hr />
