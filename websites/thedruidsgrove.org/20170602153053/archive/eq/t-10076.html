<br />
My halfling druid is amiable to the guards in Rivervale.<br />
<br />
But somehow my faction with the druid guildmaster and his minions (those who sell spells) has dropped to apprehensive.<br />
<br />
I have to sneak to train!!  :shuffle: <br />
<br />
Now the guards are supposed to be on 4 factions: Storm Reapers, Merchants of Rivervale, Mayor Gubbin and Guardians of the Vale.<br />
<br />
The druid guild NPCs are supposed to be on only three of those... all but Guardians of the Vale.<br />
<br />
So it makes no sense that I can be amiable with guards and apprehensive with people whose faction set is a subset of guards.<br />
<br />
Does it?</div></div><hr />

At least you can change it with quests or killings.  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=112 should give you a few options.  Funny... I never knew moss snakes were on any faction... but it seems even they lower your faction these days according to this list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry but laughing at halflings and the misfortunes especially over faction is kind of funny my poor old Tunare faction never recovered from those accidental slips and random slayings in PoG.<br />
<br />
Hope you manage to find a fix tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guardians of the Vale is the one faction the guildmaster is NOT on, so I don't think I want to work on that one.<br />
<br />
Guess I need to find some mobs which affect the three guildmaster factions positively and do some greenie-slaying.<br />
<br />
Still mystifies me how I trashed this faction.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bandage quest works for all of the above faction except Storm Reapers.  Storm Reapers is what is needed for the druid guild master, and it is not an easy faction to raise.<br />
<br />
The way most people mess up their Storm Reaper faction is by killing treants in SK.<br />
<br />
Also note that Storm Reapers is specific to Rivervale druid and rangers.  Qeynos druids and rangers are Karana druids but on a different faction.  Jaggedpine something or other.</div></div><hr />

If she doesn't like you, the problem is your Guardians of the Vale faction (you killed too many moss snakes).  Guardians of the Vale faction can be fixed with the bandage quest  (Yay, one of the two cities where you can buy faction).  If Ella likes you, the problem is your Storm Reapers faction (you been killing treants in SK or NK ?).  The easiest way to fix Storm Reapers faction is the &quot;exterminate the vermin&quot; quest in RV (have fun killing lots of level 1 mobs).  If your problem is Storm Reapers faction it may be faster to kill bandits in WK until the druid trainers in Surefall like you.  Note that if you have been killing treants you may be KoS in Surefall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense but this is incorrect.  Ella is on Stormreapers faction.  My Iksar monk did the bandage quest to max faction possible and is loved by the guards but still KoS to Ella and the druids and clerics.<br />
<br />
FYI the Surefall druid/ranger faction is Jaggedpine Treefolk.  :)</div></div><hr />
