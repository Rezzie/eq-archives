<br />
So these nerfs may affect some a lot more than others ?<br />
<br />
At least its the base that is changing and the scaling remains the same ? <br />
<br />
I'll let other give you a build as i'm no longer feral, and was more bear when i was as well. Having said that my mainly bear build was very good for levelling....i dont think you'll find it that important until you hit 80.<br />
<br />
It will at 80 then probably depend upon what you are going to be doing ?<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Heroics<br />
Endgame Raiding<br />
<br />
Anyways, welcome to the Grove. Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Go with that, and go with the Major Glyphs that go with that build. Minor Glyphs don't really matter. For leveling, i'd suggest going to Mangle in the feral tree, then switching over to the resto tree for Omen of Clarity, then switching back to the feral tree to finish it off before putting your last few points in the resto tree to get Master Shapeshifter. <br />
<br />
If you get to 80 and get decently geared before 3.2 ships, you WILL top damage meters. True story.</div></div><hr />
