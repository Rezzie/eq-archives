I'm not really too sure if we will need it in the future.  Being a druid, I don't really have any bagspace left because of all the other gears I have, and if those FR gears are not really needed, they will be the first to go.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I have been doing cleanup as I go, creating geat sets on the fly and vendoring lower gear.  THis subject did come up for me over this weekend though and I decided to keep any resist gear I find.  If it gets replaced later, so be it, but atleast it's there should the need arise.  I think the first time the concern came up was when I was in Hellfire Citadel on the last boss.  But it wasn't really needed.</div></div><hr />
