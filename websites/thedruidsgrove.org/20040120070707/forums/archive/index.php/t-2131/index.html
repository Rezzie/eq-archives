<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>maschana1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Imagine you could play EQ a little at work - only during lunch hour of course and on a crappy computer - which route would you follow?<br />
<br />
I am thinking about static spawns without adds where you can safely go afk and you dont have to pull?<br />
<br />
Here is a small list of places I used myself:<br />
<br />
Level 15 - 18 Fallen iksars in Tim Deep<br />
Level 15 - 18 The guard near Lavastorm in Nektoulus<br />
Level 24 - 28 The Hermit in SK<br />
Level 48 - 55 Cyndi (spelling) in the Ferrot, close to Fear portal<br />
<br />
Btw, I just learned that you can find out if your hide worked by making a hotkey: /target yourownname after hiding.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Dont remember what level I was... 35-ish maybe or higher.  Wasnt bad as a change from solb.  Could solo them when I was a little higher level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ailuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">35-ish to 42-ish - Basilisks in Jaggedpine Brell caves</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>willain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Level 44-mid 50s: Dulak - there are plenty of spots to avoid wanderers, I am partial to the warehouse next to the ramp to boat 3.  Root dot several, then afk.  <br />
<br />
Darkpaw gnolls in JP would also work - bear right when you enter the caves - eventually you'll hit a drop-off and fall down a shaft - this is a good place to set up shop root/dotting as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Every Zone has them...   even zones with wandering mobs.<br />
<br />
(Except maybe the new fear)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;new&quot; fear?  It wasn't changed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The North Wall in fear was free of wandering mobs until the update.... about a year ago.<br />
<br />
There used to be a spot there to park trackers, you can frequently find dead rangers there now as its safe for a while.... but not long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your race has the &quot;hide&quot; skill, you can use that to go invisible for however long you are afk.  You need to make sure your hide was successful first, but once successfully hidden you'll be invisible until you move.<br />
This won't do anything against undead mobs or mobs that see invis, but if you know none will be wandering by (but mobs that don't see invis might be wandering by) hide may help.</div></div><hr />
