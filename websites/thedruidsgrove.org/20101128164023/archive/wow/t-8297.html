I tried to ensure everything in it was correct, but if you see something wrong, please mention it and I'll correct it.<br />
<br />
So, you've hit level 10, and you're wondering how to get bear form?  Wonder no longer!<br />
<br />
Depending on where you are at level 10, the druid trainers you talk to may direct you to Darnassus.  If you're already in Darnassus, the trainer on the first floor will have you go talk to the one on the second floor, Mathrengyl Bearwalker.  Mathrengyl will give you a new spell, Teleport: Moonglade, and direct you to Dendrite Starblaze in Nighthaven.  Use the new teleport to get there; Dendrite is on the second floor of the building near where you port in.<br />
<br />
Next up, you need to talk to the Great Bear Spirit; he's just a bit northwest of Nighthaven.  You can see his location on the map attached at the bottom of this walkthrough.  Head back to Dendrite, and then take the hippogryph back to Rut'theran then Darkshore -- the hippogryph master is in the southwest portion of Nighthaven (or just hearthstone back).<br />
<br />
Lunaclaw is just east of Auberdine in Darkshore, inside a cave; see the map attached below for the location of the moonkin stone.  Lunaclaw is level 13, and there are level 10-12 moonkin outside the cave, so you might wish to bring a friend or two to make it easier.  However, it should be doable solo if you're careful.  Be sure to be buffed up and ready to go before you summon him.<br />
<br />
After you kill Lunaclaw and talk to his spirit, return to Moonglade and talk to Dendrite Starblaze again.  Dendrite will send you back to Darnassus and Mathrengyl, who will allow you to learn bear form!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, just wait around a few minutes and Lunaclaw will respawn. Alternatively, you don't even need to kill Lunaclaw yourself, just wait for someone else to kill him, then speak to his spirit, which appears for all players (cheap, but it's what I did :P).</div></div><hr />

I did this but Dendrite Starblaze did nothing, so I just went to Darnassus and it went fine.</div></div><hr />

Plissken, can you remember who it wouldn't let you talk to?  The FAQ in the first post is pretty step-by-step, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vendigirl</div><div class="date">11-12-2005, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Alkl. I'm a lvl 13 Night Elf druid. I've tried a number of times to speak with the Great Bear Spirit, but he does not respond. I followed through the Bear form quest via the NPC's required. I'm fairly sure I've completed all of the Teldrassil quests and I've gone on to travelling via hippogriff to Ruth'ran and Auberdine and complteting some quests there as well. <br />
Any thoughts? Is it a bug or am I missing something vital?<br />

I've abandoned the quest once and gone back to Dendrite Starblaze (Nighthaven) to have the Bear Spirit quest reissued, but the bear still won't talk. I'm stuck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jerrypcjr</div><div class="date">01-18-2006, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I activated the Moonkin Stone, then my PC hard locked just before I had the chance to speak to Lunaclaw's Spirit. Now all associated townsmen in both Nighthaven (Moonglade) and Auberdine (Darnassus), who offer this quest, have progressed on to the next sets of quests. Now I cannot learn Bear Form because WOW thinks I've completed the quest, since I did not abandoned it. <br />
<br />
I think I am the first to experience this bug! Also tried waited for another player to use the stone then talk to Lunaclaw, but that did not work because I did not see the Spirit. Blizzard support will not help be because they think this is a &quot;How do I&quot; issue. I am not loosing my mind here. Anyone have a clue what I could try next? HELP!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
same thing happened to me,, but just go to Darnassus anyways, and the  dude will give you it,, i think it might have been changed in the updates,, but ye, i did this yesturday so should work for you. And if you read  the quest log insteadof this guide, it says go straight to Darnassus, not Moonglade:p</div></div><hr />

The problem is he doesn't teach me the bear form. I can only learn the cat form. However, the quest is considered complete and i can't do it again. Do anyone have any suggestions on what i should do? I hope i don't have to start all over again...is the bear form very important? Can i play without it?<br />

Nevermnd i found it. Now i feel really dumb XD</div></div><hr />
