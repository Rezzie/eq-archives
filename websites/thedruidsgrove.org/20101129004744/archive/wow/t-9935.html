Work has actually been a lil busy and that's where I usually check the forums.  I haven't even gotten to play much WoW because I also got a new puppy....so last night was kinda like my first night back.  It feels so good to start and get back into the old routine.  I've kinda missed you guys....all your great advice and discussions.  It's so good to be back here and be playing my druid again.  Now the only difference is....I have to keep the pup from trying to help me play WoW.  He likes to be in my lap lots and last night was trying to type things while I was in WSG.  Haha!  Well...just wanted to say it's good to be back with my fellow druids.</div></div><hr />

Puppy is actually fairly well behaved for such a lil guy.  He is actually 4 months old today.  Luckily he sleeps alot because my bf, my other dog and I all wear him out during the day.  If you are on the Dalaran server and see Buttons say anything funny....it could be Dade (beagle pup) saying something to ya.  Haha!</div></div><hr />
