<br />

<br />
In fact Dark Iron was my &quot;original&quot; server. I had just started playing when the Penny Arcade/PvP conflict erupted.<br />
<br />
I can't say I totally agree with you. But then I kinda do! I have to. There's a reason I rerolled to another server, beyond just the desire to play a blood elf.<br />
<br />
Now that my BE pally is about to ding 70, I'm looking for a new pvp server for a NE drood. Don't want a whole new account. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Executus or GTFO!<br />
<br />
Both are PvP servers (Blackrock being PST with still a large Australian community and Executus being EST)</div></div><hr />

Executus or GTFO!<br />

Both are PvP servers (Blackrock being PST with still a large Australian community and Executus being EST) I've definitely looked at Executus. Thanks for the rec.</div></div><hr />
