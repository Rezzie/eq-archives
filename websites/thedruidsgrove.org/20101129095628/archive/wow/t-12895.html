I think Blizzard has been made well aware that LW needs some more impressive BOP epics to make it viable.  Almost all of the LW patterns in TBC were &lt;Kz gear, which was a little weak considering Kz was raid on training wheels.  (although still one of my favorites!)</div></div><hr />

Not just the matts.  Inscription recipes are nearly 1000g (total) for all the vendor purchased Northrend recipes.  I'v read the prices are similar for other professions.  Sort of a hidden money sink.</div></div><hr />

The wrist enchants look particularly sexy compared with what enchanters can do.  Every profession has something new and unique to offer now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">01-28-2009, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm interested to see what happens in the next expansion.  Originally, tradeskills roughly mapped to level = 5 x skill ... we maxed level 60 at 300 skill, and along the way, the stuff you used at a level roughly corresponded to what you'd gather and craft at the equivalent skill.<br />
<br />
Since we got 10 levels with BC, but a trade tier is 75, we had a bit of an overhang.  375 max was level 70, not 350.  Now, we've repeated that ... 450 max is level 80, not 400.  Thing is ... level 90's natural cap will be 400.  Will they just raise the caps to 525 and decide that this 75:10 is now the progression, or will the cap stay at 450 and have some alternate progression method?<br />
<br />
Hrmmmm.</div></div><hr />
