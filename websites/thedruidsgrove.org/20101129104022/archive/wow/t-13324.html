<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-17-2009, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As most of you are probably aware my time for Wow is limited (wife and baby boy, not to mention a young dog and a puppy!) so I no longer raid.<br />
<br />
I've played since Day 1 of wow and in the old days always healed in 40 man raids with a feral spec. Since stopping raiding before BC came out i've been purely a feral tank.<br />
<br />
3-4 weeks ago i went oomkin and am loving it.  But now we have dual specs and i have to decide what to do.....we are a guild of 3 main people with a couple others who are around a bit or who have come back to wow after a long break and may or may not stay !<br />
<br />
so we only do 5 man heroics. i know a lot of other people in various raid guilds so we have a good supply of other people who come with us when they dont have to raid.<br />
<br />
healers are still in short supply - more so now than tanks cos of the plethora of DK's on the server. plus seeing people quoting so much armour loss etc makes me wonder if i can be bothered to spec back to feral given Blizz seem to hate us so much.<br />
<br />
so although my first love is feral and i've a pretty reasonable feral set, including my Staff of Trickery, i now find myself considering a resto 2nd spec (/sigh /cry /spit :eek: )<br />
<br />
can someone provide a link to a spec that would be a good resto build for someone who will only ever heal in 5 man (heroics and maybe normals).<br />
<br />
Plus advice on glyphs.<br />
<br />
Oh and any gear advice as well if you want.....to begin i'll be using my oomkin set - circa 1800 spellpower, 16k ish mana. mp5 is my problem post nerf as i have very little spirit so its this I prob need to address with different gear.<br />
<br />
I will look at AH and crafted to get items like Earrthgiving / Wispcloak plus a look at any epic (cloth) stuff i can get from rep - i am exalted with AC/Wyrm/Knights/Kirin and Kal'uak.<br />
<br />
I've logged out in my oomkin so if anywants to take a look.<br />
<br />
Kheldar on Bronze Dragonflight EU (cant link to it sorry).<br />
<br />
We had a pally healer for HoL heroic last nite and we struggled horrendously. Now i know his gear is not the best although its around +1600 spellpower, and he's not done a great deal of healing but i want to see/understand if its gear/experience or class.<br />
<br />
I had over 30g repairs. we often seem to lose 2 people and not all the time on bosses :o  We did not even kill Loken - where as i've never not killed him before in our previous 4-5 tries - I had to go tbh after the 2nd wipe as baby boy had come home and i was then home alone in charge of him ! (luckily HoL was not the daily or i'd have been quite upset!)<br />
<br />
Normally we run with a fairly well geared (mainly 200 epics and some 213) priest and we never have a problem anywhere. so possibly its just a combination of his gear and experience as a healer than makes the healing job seem 'easy'.<br />
<br />
sorry for another novel ! i hope someone got this far without falling asleep :grin:</div></div><hr />

When i first went resto i had around the same amount healing or so now my gear is a bit better.<br />
Thing is i never had a problem healing any heroic just yet.<br />
Maybe it's rolling all the hots and nourish . i don't use the nourish glyph yet, and i'm not in tier 7 or anything. <br />
I just went to naxx this weekend, before that i had been wearing all blues mostly had the helm  of anomulus(?) from heroic nexus and i healed fine.  I am still relearning how to heal with my druid from PRE-LK.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
p.s Sorry to hijack your thread, but if anyone has any gear tips for me also or glyph tip i'd be more than happy to accept advice also :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-20-2009, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys!  I'll offer my n00bish 2 cents...<br />
<br />
The Major Glyphs I have are: <br />
Glyph of Nourish<br />
Glyph of Rejuvenation<br />
Glyph of Swiftmend<br />
<br />
This is the build I'm using for now... (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Durotan&amp;cn=Destinae&amp;gn=Liberi+Ex+Draco)<br />
@Khel, if you have low spirit, maybe pick up Living Spirit, instead of Naturalist?<br />
<br />
I left out Naturalist and picked up Living Spirit/Imp Tranquility.  You can't go wrong with a spirit boost, and I took Imp Tranquility because for me, I am still learning and wanted a nice big group heal to fall back on when things take a bad turn.  I might switch those into something else later on after I'm a little more accustomed to healing, but for now...I need that panic button.<br />
<br />
I left out the Healing Touch talents/glyphs mainly because my on-server resto guru suggested I skip it.  He advised that HT is a little less mana efficient than good HoTs and swiftmend.  But like Solar has said a bunch of times, it all comes down to your healing style.<br />
<br />
I like to keep HoTs rolling and spam nourish if my tank suddenly takes a dive in HP.  It seems to work and I've not gone Oom yet doing that.  But I'm a newborn into this resto world...I'll have to practice more and maybe then will be able to offer better advice on build/glyphs.  What I have right now seems to work alright for me.  <br />
<br />
Most of the gear I picked up was from the AH, just to get started off.  Resto4Life has a really good &quot;starter&quot; gear list that will have you more than ready for Naxx 10 and most of the stuff is pretty easy to get.  I'll Link the two guides:<br />
<br />
For your Back, waist, wrist, neck and rings (http://www.resto4life.com/2009/01/13/pre-raid-gear-back-waist-wrist-neck-and-fingers/)<br />
<br />
then <br />
<br />
For head, shoulder, chest, hands, legs and boots :) (http://www.resto4life.com/2009/01/02/pre-raid-gear-head-shoulder-chest-hands-legs-feet/)<br />
<br />
The trinket list I didn't see on that blog...but I picked up the badge trinket, the badge relic, and grabbed the Soul Preserver from REGULAR Culling of Stratholme.  Drops from the chest after the last boss.<br />
<br />
For rings, unfortunately, I just grabbed whatever I could from quests/drops.  I'm still trying to fill that slot with better items.  <br />
<br />
I'm told my gear is a mix of healie/boomie gear, but if I can keep a tank alive...I suppose it's not too bad.  I hope that helps a little.  But again, guys, keep in mind that this is being posted by a BARE! RAWR!<br />
<br />
Oh, and as far as H:HoL...that place is a nightmare...I wonder if it's a class healing issue?  I don't know much about lvl 80 pally healers, but as far as I know they're mainly single target uber heals.  Maybe if he'd have put a beacon of light on your tank and group healed?  I can only think of that big Elemental guy with the sparks and the final boss right now, which seem very AoE healing intensive.  I don't know that Pallies have as easy a time with that as other classes.<br />
<br />
I know my lowbie pally has a glyph that splash heals the group, but I'm really not sure how much that would help in HoL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheers Des - i went with the build I linked above in the end - although i cant remember everything I look.<br />
<br />
I still need to get the gear, the grp and the heroic i feel comfortable with to try out heroic 5 man healing for the first time !<br />
<br />
And i so far do not have any glyphs at all....since 3.1 glyph prices seem to have gone crazy, and i'm not only talking about the new ones....old ones are suddenly showing on my auctioneer as being like 300% + price and showing in red.<br />
<br />
As for my spirit its not over 300 iirc. although i'm working on actually getting proper healer gear and not having to simply use my oomkin set.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the links - i will take a look later.<br />
<br />
Atm my heal set is 90% my oomkin set as you'd see on my armoury.<br />
<br />
However i have had the following made :<br />
<br />
Wispclaok<br />
Earthgiving Legs<br />
<br />
I'll keep looking on the AH for other nice items to buy / craft.<br />
<br />
And i will be looking for good healing loot in heroics.  However badges will be used for oomkin gear for the minute.<br />
<br />
Pally healers is an interesting one  - we did daily HoS yesterday with a pally and they struggled a lot to start, although a couple people were reporting lag and the tank d/c twice and lagged out in fights a couple times to. i know nothing about pally's, although i did have the Beacon buff on me - what's it do ?<br />
<br />
We completed it in the end but it was not a pretty run and i had 20g or so repairs.<br />
<br />
I dont mind HoL H - its a fun place. I dont feel anything is that hard - just gotta be a little aware of the final boss...keep close to him normally in the fight and then get out of the way of his frost nova.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Beacon of Light is fun!<br />
<br />
If you have the beacon on you, iirc, whenever a heal is cast on another party member, you also receive 100% of that heal, without the Pally having to cast the heal directly onto you.  It's a beautiful thing, it really is.  :)<br />
<br />
I logged out last night in my resto gear/spec (but not in tree form as I was prancing around at the AH and it's not as fun to do as a tree...too many people ask you to heal stuff).  So that's there today if you would like to take a look-see.<br />
<br />
<br />
I healed H: DtK last night, and really the only casualties we had were because I'm not really that great at group healing.  I did MUCH better this time than I normally do, and I'm learning how to do it.  Oh, and I died on Novos for not being able to get out of his stupid Blizzard.  <br />
<br />
I LOVED healing on that instance though, and I'm hoping for a lot more practice in the coming days so I can be prepared for Naxx Healing this weekend! YAY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can heal a tank in H-Dtk through the big dino, you can heal just fine in Naxx!  Only two bosses (Patchy/Sapph) hits that hard, and if you make it that far your first time in, you did good work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOOT!  Thx for the encouraging words Solar!  We always take 3 healers into 10 man everything.  Mostly just so we have a little bit more wipe prevention.  No omg-oom! healers and usually we can keep our DPS topped off.<br />
<br />
He's an incredibly well geared tank though.  We tried for the achievement, but were short one raptor *sigh*  I imagine healing him on Dred + 5 Raptors is a decent test.  But again, there wasn't much group healing going on.  I would guess that Naxx is a bit more &quot;raid heal&quot; intensive.  <br />
<br />
Scariest fight for me I think will be Loatheb, as I'm not very skilled at getting things timed right and my DBM has been WAY off since I updated it.  As in, when we were fighting Cyanigosa, I was warned that the Arcane Vacuum was coming about 5 seconds after it happened.  It was very eew, but I was tanking so it wasn't a huge huge deal...<br />
<br />
I'm scared to DEATH of Loatheb healing.  I dps'd on him last time and I know how much damage I was taking personally.  I can't imagine trying to keep a tank + an entire raid up through that fight with all the quirky timing.<br />
<br />
Well, I assume Heigan won't be a walk in the park either...I tend to survive until the very last poison splash before he teleports back onto the platform.    <br />
<br />
I wish I was on server with some of you guys.  I tend to do a lot of Overhealing.  Mostly it's from timing on the LB.  I'll refresh it just a split second too late.  Or I'll hit a wrong key accidentally...*blushes*<br />
<br />
  How big of a deal is over healing?  I imagine if you're oom constantly, then it's a problem...and maybe in the case of threat it could pose a problem. <br />
<br />
How do druids prevent over-healing?  Is it just a case of having a general idea of how big your heals are?  <br />
<br />
Like, if I know my Nourish will hit when LB+Rejuv are ticking for ~7.7k...I would just time that heal for when the tank absolutely needs a heal around that amount?<br />
<br />
I'd like to be one of those healers that's just ridiculously awesome, but there's SO much to think about.  It's such a strange new world compared to tanking...<br />
<br />
...with tanking, I pull up omen and all I have to do is make sure I don't over-pull and that I'm at the top of the omen meter.  If someone passes me, I bite them.  Tanking, up until the rage starvation issue, is so much easier than healing.  &quot;Know where to stand.  Hit stuff. Pick up adds.  Stay on top of omen.  Yell at DPS about target order.&quot;  Check, check, check!  Hehehe!</div></div><hr />

I bet you will be bored most of the time!  Also, Lotheb is much easier since patch!  <br />
<br />
Just have to hit the MT with a LB (1 stack) that will bloom at the right time, and have the glyph of Wild Growth.  You will do more than your fair share of both raid heals and MT healing on that fight!  You can aslo squeeze in a nourish if you are fast, but can easily suvive without it!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Swiftmend is pure must-have.  <br />
<br />
Nourish is a nice healing boost when the damage taken is enough to warrant having all hots ticking and Nourish to top off.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom is... ok since the nerf, but not what it used to be.  <br />
If you had OOM problems, Innervate might be better.  <br />
Or the Rebirth (?) one that rezzes with increased mana/health. One of my guildie trees really liked that, but is going to switch to Nourish/Swiftmend/Wild Growth, which is what I have for raid healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought swift and nourish looked good.<br />
<br />
WG is not for me as a non raid healer.<br />
<br />
i'll look at lifebloom.<br />
<br />
i was thinking of getting regrowth?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">05-15-2009, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Regrowth Glyph, if I understand its tooltip correctly- implies that you'd have regrowth on your target already, then apply it again while it's still ticking to gain the extra 20% healing.... <br />
<br />
I guess it's good if you throw a regrowth then maybe use NS in front of another regrowth?  But since the HoT from Regrowth doesn't stack on itself...<br />
<br />
For 5 man healing right now, I've got Swiftmend, Nourish, and Rejuvenation for Glyphs.  Forgot all about lifebloom...I might look into that one sometime =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gronyon</div><div class="date">05-16-2009, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Casting only glyphed-Regrowth used to be a very good strategy. It had +50% crit (now +25% only) doesn't require anything to be up on the target before, and all but the first you cast gets +20% direct heal.<br />
<br />
I read a lot of posts and blogs a bit everywhere about 3.1 changes, and everybody swear by Nourish. Sure 3.1 gives it +25% crit and a glyph that adds +6% per hot on the target.<br />
Yes, but everybody speaks of raid content, mostly only ulduar, and most of the time wearing T7 (which gives +5% per hot to nourish).<br />
<br />
I personnaly like Regrowth a lot. I only heal 5-man and should start heroic soon. I'll first try a Regrowth spec (skipping all talents that only improves nourish and healing touch), with regrowth and swiftmend glyphs, and Life Seed talent (when critting with a heal, set up a seed that will heal after the next received it). I don't plan on using Life Bloom, at least not 3 stacks. Wild Growth for a few encounters where the whole group took damage (yet we would need to all be close to each other which is rare :( but sometimes healing 2 people for 1 GCD is important whatever the mana lost).<br />
<br />
If heroics shows me that I'm getting OOM too fast, I'll consider switching to a Nourish oriented build.<br />

<br />
If you find yourself constantly refreshing Regrowth, then glyph for it, the extra 20% is nice.  <br />
<br />
If you find you like the healing style of hot up and top off with Nourish, then I'd recc glyphing for it.<br />
<br />
Heck, for that matter, you could go Regrowth/Nourish/Swiftmend...<br />
<br />
I still use lifebloom a lot in my healing, both 5mans and raids.  But, as mentioned, hardly ever (except MT) a multi-stack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I don't need the extra HoT ticking then I'll use Nourish over regrowth now, even without the 4 piece bonus (4 weeks running I've lost the roll).  might be dreaming and far too lazy to go look it up, but I'm pretty sure that it's a significantly higher mana cost for RG than Nourish and the direct heal portion is lower with less of a crit change.<br />
<br />
If it's a damage spike then I'll nourish, if they're taking more damage than LB/Rejuve can comfortably soak then I'll regrowth for the extra HoT tick and then Swiftmend/Nourish or let lifebloom Bloom and re-apply as necessary.<br />
<br />
I do also use Wild growth a lot in 5 and 10 man healing. Other than being a group heal, I like it a lot for buying you a couple of extra seconds to get some more powerful healing down on people (who shouldn't be taking damage).<br />
<br />
Choices choices, I like it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, healing in BG's will pretty gaurentee that no one cusses you out.  Everyone /hug healers, because they are very tough to come by.  <br />
<br />
If you want practice raid healing, jump into a WG and have at it!  If folks die...well you at least prevented it temporarily.  So no one will give you grief.  Also, really easy to do the dailies in WG as resto, since anyone you heal gives you kills/credit.  (thats x6 people with most Wild Growths)<br />
<br />
For glyphs I would reccomend going WG  /  Swiftmend  /  Nourish.  (Get the idol from EoV's or Naxx25 that reduces the cost of Rej, and Rej everyone you get in range of = WIN!!!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Curiously, would healing a BG end up getting you rep with each of the PvP factions?  I'd heard that...for WG for example...you &quot;HAVE&quot; to capture a flag.  no?</div></div><hr />

Really digging these caster alts.  It's really a change of pace from face-tanking, but it's a refreshing change.  Has helped me appreciate my bear a lil more tbh.  <br />
<br />
As far as my resto-ing goes, I don't think I'll ever &quot;get it&quot;.  Those healing buttons may as well be written in greek by now- as I've spent 80 levels mauling things into submission...and I am starting to believe I'm just not &quot;able&quot; to heal.  <br />

Reg Nex = Fail =(  <br />
<br />
Some of it was lag/freezing up screens thx to my stupid anti-virus software opting to randomly update during the middle of the instance...but I can't blame it purely on that.  I'm just fail as a healer.  People INSIST on dragging me in to heal for learning experiences...all that usually happens is I end up failing miserably at keeping folks alive, then resolving that I'll never heal again...only to be asked/pressured into it again the next night.  I don't mind- but I should come with a disclaimer...  &quot;Warning:  Grouping with this fail tree may result in extremely high repair costs.

guess it depends if you find yourself low on spirit/going oom much ?<br />
<br />
soul preserver also seems to have a chance to make you next heal spell cost 800 mana less....<br />

Egg gives a chance to get a big haste gain iirc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say it depends, you do get a boost to your healing via spirit, but it isn't as much as from spellpower as a base stat. Personally I love the trinket for the Mana regen as much as anything.<br />
<br />
I don't tend to worry too much about stacking haste as resto, I know others might disagree with me, but my standard rotation, if you like, is Rejuve, Lifebloom, Wildgrowth and Nourish, myabe with Regrowth thrown in depending on circumstance so I don't feel that stacking huge amounts of haste over, say, Spirit is that beneficial for how I like to heal.<br />
<br />
I do think the 3.1 changes have thrown a lot more variation into how you [can] heal and there isn't so much of a single &quot;right&quot; way to do things.  I like stacking Spirit for a number of reasons, but chief amongst them are:<br />
Bonus to healing<br />
Improved mana regen<br />
Spirit is buffable<br />
<br />
I think the last point is quite important. The resto talents buff your base spirit by, I think, 15%, Pally Kings buffs adds another 10% and so on so I do feel that it is worth stacking spirit for that alone. And on your talent points 84 + 15% = 96.6spirit from the trinket, not the 84 listed on the tooltip :)<br />
<br />
from a 10man + point of view where you've got a lot of buffs and have more potential to run into mana issues then it's a great trinket. For the most part I kick it off whenever there's a lull in casting on a fight or, more rarely, in conjunction with Innervate which is spirit based.  I use it more frequently to keep myself topped up while Innervate is on CD, I've used my Innervate on someone else and/or I've used a pot on runs through Naxx where we're less than ideal; we managed a run without a Character providing mana regen recently, no SPs, Surv Hunters, Shammies etc, that was tough:D.</div></div><hr />

...And thinking about it...I imagine a trinket like that comes in REALLY handy on those epically long fights like KT.<br />
<br />
As far as my rotation for healing...I don't really have one.  I tend to hit whatever's needed to keep folks from dying.  If that's a swiftmend, or NS and HT...whatever keeps us from wiping.  I really don't heal much beyond 5-man instances though.  For raids, it just seems so overwhelming.  I prefer to tank =)</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, use the Soul Preserver.<br />
<br />
As to the Egg/haste, it really shines when you find yourself having to spam the big heals (HT/Nourish with all hots ticking) to keep the tank up - less cast time = more HPS = living tank = happy raid. :-)  More is nice but not something I'd go out of my way to stack normally.  YMMV<br />
<br />
One minor nit-pick: I thought Innervate is no longer spirit based, or was that change coming in 3.2?<br />

I'd like to be confident enough to take on healing for raids.  But the instant someone sends a tell that says &quot;Hey Des, wanna heal OS10?&quot; I get intensely nervous and usually end up finding a way to get out of going.  =( Very sad.  <br />

I had a bit of time last nite and jumped online quick hoping for a fast heroic before needing to cook.<br />
<br />
not many online we knew....managed to add a great rogue we know to myself and guildie tank.<br />
<br />
then sat around looking for more.  found a shammy whose gear (on wow heroes) looked ok.<br />
<br />
so we needed a healer and we stalled....big time....20 mins later still no healer so i am getting pressured to heal :(<br />
<br />
reluctantly i said ok but choose something i know !  so it ended up being Drak (given the shammy was in Drak LFM) which i've never healed !  then we struggled for a dps !<br />
<br />
in the end the shammy says i have a hunter (/shudder) but when i said 1500dps+ ? they said they dont know much about them as they are new (/shudder again)<br />
<br />
Still it went ok but i do not enjoy healing. the game is meant to be my relaxation and i find myself stressing all the time healing solo in a 5 man. <br />
<br />
Still the rogue died once when he got aggro from the first boss and went from about 20k hp to zero in the blink of an eye. and we wiped on Dred when a summoned add went right for me,  taking me out quite fast! resolved that with a better position to tank him at.<br />
<br />
i much preferred healing in a 40 man raid knowing there were others also checking to see HP status not just me, and also having healing assignments like the melee or grp 6+7 etc.<br />
<br />
i doubt i will ever see myself advertising myself in lfg etc as a healer but if i can get to a position whereby i'm more happy to heal places when we are stuck, like last nite that will be fine.<br />
<br />
i still struggle to find the buttons when more than 1 person are taking damage ! i do now have healbot set up a bit better....both left click and right click now do healing spells (lifebloom and nourish) rather than one casting thorns :p<br />
<br />
oh and i used Nature's Swiftness twice to pop off a fast HT on the tank :blow: <br />
<br />
plus i remembered swiftmend once :grin: <br />
<br />
Be lucky you are not on my server needing a healer for a heroic ! lol.</div></div><hr />

Actually I think you're right, they changed it[last patch?] to something more convoluted and painful I'm sure and I'm too lazy to figure out which WoW sites aren't blocked by the company firewall.<br />
<br />
As to the Egg/haste, it really shines when you find yourself having to spam the big heals (HT/Nourish with all hots ticking) to keep the tank up - less cast time = more HPS = living tank = happy raid. :-) More is nice but not something I'd go out of my way to stack normally. YMMV<br />
With the 4xT7 and  1.2second unbuffed cast time, Nourish &gt; Healing Touch for me as a standard Big Heal. I use HT now and again, but mostly alongside Nature's swiftness.  Most Resto gear comes with Haste whether you like it or not and with your 3 major healing spells (rejuve, lifebloom and Wildgrowth) being essentially instant casts I agree that it's not a stat to go out of your way to stack<br />
<br />
Mostly, I agree with Nellie - if you find yourself running out of mana often, use the Spirit-World Glass to boost your regen. Otherwise, use the Soul Preserver.<br />
<br />
Never dropped for me so had to go look it up. For a 5man blue, that's a pretty stonking trinket though reading the comments on WoW Head it looks like HoT ticks don't proc the mana reduction and it's a low (2% proc) rate which possibly makes it slightly less awesome for a Druid who mainly HoT heals (i.e Me) but it's a good whack of Spell Power if nothing else. Might have to pressure some people to do some timed runs :)<br />
<br />
With badges to spare, I'd possibly suggest that from a druid point of view that the Egg &gt; soul presever just for the spellpower bonus though again I guess that depends entirely on how you heal fights. If you cast a lot of Nourish/Regrowth and maybe Healing Touch then perhaps the soul preserver edges the egg, though with HT, the Haste proc is probably of more benefit.<br />
<br />
Right now with healing to spare and being Mostly a Rejuve/LB healer I think the spirit glass still edges for myself, but I might have to experiment a bit more.<br />
<br />
Maybe this belongs on another post...but sometimes I think I'd rather miss out on a raid than heal for it =(. It just seems like SO much pressure with 9 other people (or 24) relying on you to keep them + tanks alive...<br />
depending on circumstance and where people are in terms of progression I find Naxx healing generally far less panic inducing than most top end 5 man instances.<br />
<br />
Confidence does play a part and in some respects that's only something that can come with practice. Likewise knowing the fights, knowing not to stand there, to move here, that slapping a hot on that geezer over there will help and so on.<br />
<br />
We tend to run Naxx with 2 healers now, myself and a.n other, normally a priest, with another druid/shammy/priest specced DPS but ready to swap to healing gear when needed. One of us covers the MT, the other the OT and we back each other up. If I see the MT, for example, taking a lot of damage then I slap some HoTs, maybe a nourish or two down to help the other healer out and we both chuck raid heals out with gay abandon when needed.<br />
<br />
Sometimes things just go wrong and if you're not doing something silly like getting silenced on the first boss then no-one should be shouting at you.<br />
<br />
Still the rogue died once when he got aggro from the first boss and went from about 20k hp to zero in the blink of an eye. and we wiped on Dred when a summoned add went right for me, taking me out quite fast! resolved that with a better position to tank him at.<br />
That's the Rogue's problem, not yours, imo.  It's not your job to keep a DPS up who's decided they want to Tank. They've got an aggro dump and they should be paying enough attention to deal with it. I'm not say just sit back and let them die, but we take tanks into an Instance for a reason. I do tend to keep a rejuve and lob the odd LB on &quot;problem&quot; DPSers who insist on grabbing aggro now and again, DPSers who consistently pull aggro and make no effort to get the mob back on the tank I let die. If I'm having to pour healing onto a DPS character to try and keep them up, then the Tank is also likely to go down and it might take a while, but I can keep a tank, 1-2 dps and myself up in a fight pretty much indefinitely once the aggro monkey is out of the picture and not sapping my mana. As a side benefit, when they're having to be ress'ed after every fight, the concept of aggro management might start to sink in. :D<br />

plus i remembered swiftmend once <br />
Practice :)  NS and Swiftmend especially used to be staples of my healing rotation, both in many respects have been replaced by Nourish as my go to heal. I do still use both, but mostly in an &quot;oh ****!&quot; capacity now.<br />
<br />
For raids, it just seems so overwhelming. I prefer to tank =)<br />
Horses for courses :)  I'm struggling with tanking at the moment, sounds like a mirror of you wiht healing at the moment, so many buttons! which one do I hit and when? I spent half of VH running round the place trying to round up stray mobs the other night and how in gawds name are you supposed to see anything other than a big hairy bear arse during a fight :D  You tank, I'll heal :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason I am terrified and will proclaim myself a fail healer all day long is because I have no problem keeping up a tank in 5 man heroics.  The instant the group starts catching aggro or taking AoE damage...it turns nightmarish quite quickly.<br />
<br />
We did H:HoL and I healed it last night and I kept losing the rogue and kitty druid when they'd pull aggro.  I just couldn't get a big enough heal off fast enough.  Even Rejuv+Swiftmend wasn't enough...Then when we got to the Loken fight...I may as well have been DC'd. =(<br />
<br />
The group didn't quite run far enough from the Novas and they were getting nuked...HARD...by it.  I just couldn't keep up with it.  So my biggest struggle is with multiple target healing, which, unfortunately, is what healing is about.<br />
<br />
I'm not even sure a healing addon would help.  It's sad.  I've had 2 guilds try and recruit me to be one of their healers for raiding, and I just...can't... <br />
<br />
I dunno.  Tanking is just so much more relaxing for me.  It's such a relief when we get our raid group together and they assign roles and I see &quot;Des= OT&quot; in raid chat.  PHEW!</div></div><hr />

(also bought the Bindings of the Depths yesterday, a nice Uldaur ilvl 219 drop but they are probably more oomkin ready than healing....)<br />
<br />
Still a few places i've not had the confidence to go to....CoS Timed being 1.  Also not tried a HoL as we have sorta stopped running it due to over running it !<br />
<br />
But running mainly with people i know, and yes who are fairly well geared deaths are not common. Probably i'd struggle more with poor quality pugs.<br />
<br />
Have had a couple problems recently in Gun....we try to tank the snake boss at the doorway to 'his' room, the better to avoid posion nova for ranged dps and healer who 'hide' the other side of the doorway. also this should help tank control adds better.  but i've been killed a couple times recently by adds coming past the boss/tank and coming to me :(<br />
<br />
also the double boss with the big stone looking guy and the ele and its mojo puddles.  does aggro dump when the bosses swap which i've not noticed before ?  cos i kept getting a boss coming for me, esp the Ele one.... ?</div></div><hr />

Every single time I've run it in the past two or three weeks, the group survives but I die from being wrapped by snakes.  Every time, without fail, this happens.  And yes, I believe he dumps aggro when he changes from Statue form to Elemental form.  Same with Ekk, I'm told.  He seems to dump aggro when he jumps around.   <br />
<br />
I like it more when the first boss gets tanked in the room after you down the second boss.  Seems to prevent the snake wraps from happening.  But I'm not sure if they've hotfixed that so it doesn't work now or what the situation is.</div></div><hr />

hmm then i think its more practice on positioning so the tank can pick up the Ele or Statue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i had no chance to keep him alive !<br />
<br />
Same happened on that damn statue/ele - lost 2 people over the course of the fight due to them taking aggro attacking or tank not grabbing him fast enough ? not sure which.<br />
<br />
Well i healed the daily to Drak...only the Dinosaur still gives me some problem if i get feared one way and the tank the other....comes down to how many HOT's i got on the tank before the fear arrives.<br />
<br />
Plus UK followed by Gun yesterday as no other healers around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
King Dred (the big Dino Boss) is one of the only heroic fights I'll keep LB rolling on the tank for until we get feared, then I let it bloom and start over.  Gives me a second to get turned around and run back to my tank.  Speaking of tanks...I have a fun story to tell.  I'll post it on my random nonsense thread lol.</div></div><hr />

I tanked for it when I got it-  but the goal is to kill 6 of his little raptor buddies after he is engaged, but before he dies...<br />
<br />
I remember just barely surviving with my former bear handler healing and having to pop trinkets and a few &quot;zomg!!!&quot; buttons...I haven't yet tried to heal through that, but I can imagine it's probably a pretty wild one to heal through...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-29-2009, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope not done the achievement at all.<br />
<br />
our tank never wants to try.<br />
<br />
so much easier if you have a shammy for totem.<br />
<br />
i'm sure it would be easy with a good grp....and esp if the dps take down the adds when they appear and dont keep attacking Dred.<br />
<br />
Given i seem to hardly use much mana when healing i would expect to be ok with healing through the achievement. As long as the tank grabs the adds ok and they are kill fast enough to have 1 at a time ?</div></div><hr />

Then the hunter went and misdirected the last two to me and we got them down, then nuked Dred.  Depends on what your group is comfy with, I think.</div></div><hr />

yeah tank needs to grab them as they come - you dont want them running amok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healed Heroic CoS for the first time - and it was with our gearing up and learning guildy warrior tank.<br />
<br />
We even managed it timed which was not the plan as the tank was not totally au fait with it, and i'd warned them i'd never healed CoS. Although as usual these days we all passed on the Drake !<br />
<br />
Then i was healing Heroic Gun and suddenly our guildie usual DK tank but now doing some 5 mans on his new 80 pally had to leave to go and collect his wife earlier than expected.<br />
<br />
We'd done 2 bosses so decided to try and move along without getting a pug dps - which may have been difficult given the bosses we had downed.<br />
<br />
In the end we 4 manned Eck....the remaining trash...AND Gal'darah with no wipes.<br />
<br />
Druid healing ftw :)</div></div><hr />

I love, love, LOVE healing!  I've been tossed in as a tank more and more recently for our 5-mans and, it's easy to see I'm out of practice.  Need to get my big bear butt out there and get some practice!  I ALSO should enchant my bear gear better...but I digress...</div></div><hr />

i think i am going to go feral again now with the patch. i miss it.  although gear it not as good as the high level stuff i've got from AH etc (Uldaur gear).<br />
<br />
i need the proto hide legs and maybe a nimble climbers belt.<br />

I miss being a bear (and I'm a really ugly version of a polar bear now...ugh...Des might be getting a new hair color soon...)<br />

I don't really know if I want to try for the crafted or just go and heal my way to a pile of EoC's and grab some badge gear.  I'll have to take a look at what gems and stats are out there before I make any decisions. =)</div></div><hr />

Healing OS is fun!  Not a whole lot of raid damage except on trash, and even then- it's not too bad.  <br />
<br />
The groups of 4-5 mobs, the &quot;smaller&quot; dragonkin have this orb type thing like the Prince has in OK, that's usually about the worst party-wide damage I think.  &lt;3 remove curse for trash btw.</div></div><hr />

I tweaked my talents around to make the most of the new boost to Nourish (just delete Lifebloom and be done with it, you seem determined to make us spot healers like everyone else :()<br />
<br />
Must admit, it does make a BiiiiG difference to Nourish, especially on a Crit. I also put the points back in Living Seed and I still think it's a bit &quot;meh&quot; for a 3 point talent. The best I've seen it do, even trying to concentrate on Nourish healing rather than too much emphasis on LB was 4% of total healing.  For comparison, the talisman of forethought did 2% so not desperately happy about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cant say i have an issue with LB. i like it and use it a lot.<br />
<br />
just proves i'm not a healer if healers dont like it !lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">08-14-2009, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love lifebloom and the whole ethos of Druids being HoT healers, just sad to see it being, in many respects, undermined patch after patch in favour of increasing the reliance on Nourish.  Although with the badges starting to flow I do like the look of the two piece bonus on the T8 gear giving an instant heal to Rejuve, but I didn't look into it enough yet to figure out if that's at the start of applying the heal or hopefully at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-28-2010, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok time for a thread resurrection !!<br />
<br />
now i am looking to heal a bit again are there any changes with the past few patches wrt glyphs.....<br />
<br />
i saw one called rapid rejuvenation ?  dont remember that one b4 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">02-04-2010, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the rapid rejuvenation one is new - 3.2 or so.<br />
<br />
It basically accelerates the ticks of rejuv so they do the same amount of healing more quickly.<br />
<br />
I'm on the fence regarding its usefulness, but I think it would be doubly sweet combined with whatever tier bonus it is that lets rejuv ticks crit.  4pT9?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-08-2010, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i dont raid so the tier bonsues are perhaps not going to be coming my way.<br />
<br />
not sure if i think its worth it or not.<br />
<br />
i better go recheck my tree glyphs.<br />
<br />
i know i ahve Lifebloom, and i'm sure I got regrowth cos it ws cheap on AH !</div></div><hr />

i've recently bought some cloth 264 shoulders that drop from trash in ICC 25.....cant remember the name.<br />

then i have the 245 crafted wrists, Lunar Eclipse Chestguard, Mask of Abundant Growth (EOT's?), both EOT rings and the 264 EOF Gloves.<br />
