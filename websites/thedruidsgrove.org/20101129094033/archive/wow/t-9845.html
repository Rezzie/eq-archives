Im putting together a list of where I remember gathering herbs.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Does anyone have any suggestions as to where to gather Plaguebloom?  I have been down in un'goro and getting heaps of Mountain Silversage and Golden Sansam, and need Plaguebloom to make elixer of the mongoose/sages.</div></div><hr />

At 53 I'd concentrate mainly on west, east is more plentiful but the combined levels of creatures and the sheer number can make gathing take much longer there than you might want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I have come up with so far.  I am NE, and not really familiar with horde starting areas, but I assume that they are filled with low lvl herbs just like Darnassus.  Off the top of my head, this is what I remember:<br />
<br />
Darnassus / Goldshire / Sentinel Hill area are great for Peacebloom, Earthroot and Silverleaf. <br />
<br />
Ashenvale is great for Briarthorn and Mageroyal.  <br />
<br />
Wetlands and SS have quite a few herbs, but is excelent for Briarthorn (and swifthistle), Mageroyal and Liferoot<br />
<br />
Arathi has Kingsblood and Goldthorn,<br />
<br />
STV Goldthorn is everywhere<br />
<br />
The area around ST (Marshlands?) is a gold mine for blindweed, liferoot and a bunch of other really useful herbs which I cant remember right now<br />
<br />
Feralas is packed with sungrass<br />
<br />
Tanaris has firebloom, that’s about it.<br />
<br />
Blasted Lands has lots of Gromsblood.<br />
<br />
Mara is the only place I’ve found for ghost mushrooms<br />
<br />
Un’Goro is great for Mountain Silversage and Golden Sansam</div></div><hr />

You can also import saved data from http://gather.reet.org/.  Alternatively, search Thottbot for an herb name, then display the maps for the different zones... it'll show you the locations it's been seen at.</div></div><hr />
