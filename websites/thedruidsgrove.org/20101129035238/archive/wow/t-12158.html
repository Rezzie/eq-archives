Rawr is a armor analyzing tool. Not only will it analyze your current status, but you can see how things would appear with select buffs and debuffs. It'll also display upgrades, both in gear and gems.<br />
<br />
It's a pretty sweet application. For anybody that's all into numbers, this is nothing but numbers. Unfortunately, it is Windows only as it requires the .NET 2.0 framework. Sorry Mac druids.</div></div><hr />

Dunno why I didn't post this.  It's a nice little application for analyzing your gear and it shows in ratings terms what your upgrades are and how best to itemize yourself.  <br />

I &lt;3 programmers....though I may be biased.</div></div><hr />

It is great while leveling and you aren't sure if 2x+AP is better than +agi, etc.<br />
<br />
I think someone copied the hunter version and made a druid version, but it is no longer supported or maintained.</div></div><hr />
