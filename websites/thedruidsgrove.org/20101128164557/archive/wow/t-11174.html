<br />
Overview<br />
<br />
Knowing how the system works will go a long way towards helping you increase your Cenarion Circle reputation with maximum efficiency. The key is to profit as long as possible from the reputation you gain from killing cultists, as it stops yielding rep when you reach the end of friendly for avengers and geolords, and at the end of honored for flame reavers. It is important to not turn in any texts, perform any summons, or even do any quests until that point. While you do this, store your accumulated texts and cultist set pieces on mules. A LOT of mules as we will see. Max your account. Ask friends to create mules for you.<br />
<br />
There is another trick to benefit more from summons. Tactical Field Duty quests I-IV require templar kills and give 50 rep per turn-in. Hence once you are at the summons part of the grind, keep your log filled with tactical quests I-IV as much as you can by running Field Duty runs. For the purpose of this guide, we assume a quest completion for every second summon. With enough effort, you can increase that ratio considerably. Completing a quest increases your reputation gain from 5 to 55 for a templar kill, and this boosts reputation gain. <br />
<br />
Assumptions:<br />
<br />
    * You are starting at 0/3000 Neutral reputation level.<br />
    * You have never completed any quests with Cenarion Circle (sorry druids).<br />
    * You average a 20% drop rate on Encrypted Twilight Texts.<br />
    * You average a 4% drop rate on Twilight Trappings[1] set pieces.<br />
    * You earn an estimated 2,000 reputation points for the Silithus quests<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
<br />
   1. Kill 9000 Cultists to earn:<br />
          * 9000 rep from kills, which takes you past Neutral and Friendly to 0/12,000 Honored, at which point you stop earning rep from killing Cultists<br />
          * 1,800 texts worth 18,000 rep, which you store on mules<br />
          * 120 full sets, which you store on mules <br />
   2. Kill 2,000 Flamereavers to earn:<br />
          * 2000 rep from kills, which takes you to 2000/12,000 Honored<br />
          * 400 texts, worth 4000 rep, which you store on mules<br />
          * 30 full sets, which you store on mules <br />
   3. Summon 150 Templars (while making sure you have as many tactical quests I-IV as possible at all times) to earn:<br />
          * 750 rep from killing Templars<br />
          * 3750 rep from completing tactical quest, assuming one completion every second summon. Plus 60 tactical badges<br />
          * 1875 rep (estimated) for Field Duty runs to keep your log filled with tactical quests I-IV, assuming the ratio of one completion for every two summons<br />
          * A total of 6375 rep, bringing you to 8375/12,000 Honored <br />
   4. Questing time! Do all the Silithus quests for 2000 rep, bringing you to 10,375/12,000 Honored<br />
   5. Text turn-in time. Turn in your saved 2200 texts worth 22,000 reputation, bringing you to 20,375/21,000 Revered <br />
<br />
At this point, you should be roughly 625 rep short of Exalted. You can obtain this relatively easily by:<br />
<br />
    * Buying/farming more texts<br />
    * Earning rep from Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (AQ-20)<br />
    * Killing a few more Flamereavers in step 2<br />
    * Doing logistics and combat quests for 50 rep each. You already have 60 tactical badges at this point. Enough for 3 purples and a blue<br />
    * Field Duty runs (As of Patch 1.11, this quest gives 25 rep at honored for Field Duty turn-ins)<br />
    * Assuming a ratio higher than one in two for completing the tactical quest in step 3 <br />
<br />
Twilight Cultist Calculations:<br />
<br />
There are different strategies for gaining rep through summoning templars. In each example, we assume the same amount of initial templar-summoning:<br />
<br />
    * Example 1: Kill 27 Templars (5 rep each) and make 9 Abyssal Crest turn-ins (50 rep each). This example costs 27 twilight sets and nets 585 rep.<br />
    * Example 2: Kill 27 Templars (5 rep each), kill 9 Dukes (25 rep each), and make 3 Abyssal Signet turn-ins (100 rep each). This example costs 36 twilight sets, 9 large brilliant shards, and nets 660 rep.<br />
    * Example 3: Kill 27 Templars (5 rep each), kill 9 Dukes (25 rep each), kill 3 Royals (50 rep each), and make 1 Abyssal Scepter turn-in (150 rep). This example costs 39 twilight sets, 24 large brilliant shards, and nets 660 rep. <br />
<br />
As you can see by these examples, the best way to gain rep through summoning is, oddly enough, example 2, which is of middle difficulty. Example 2, which involves killing Dukes, yields the same rep as killing Royals, but it cheaper and doesn't require an army.<br />
<br />
The assumption of equal rep based on Templar summons is poor when it truly comes down to the resources spent (Twilight Sets and Large Brilliant Shards) just by summoning Templars with the same amount of Twilight Sets as per example 2 &amp; 3:<br />
<br />
    * Using 36 twilight sets, kills 36 Templars (5 rep each) and 12 Crest Turn-ins = 780 rep<br />
    * Using 39 twilight sets, kills 39 Templars (5 rep each) and 13 Crest Turn-ins = 845 rep <br />
<br />
Therefore, the best resource and time-efficient method of summoning rep, is Templars. Also, consider Cenarion Tactical quest bonuses of Templars is additional rep you can earn. Note however, that it's worth killing at least 2 Royals (one for the Nature Resist ring quest, and the other because the first time you kill a Royal, you only need one scepter for the turn-in, not the three you need for subsequent turn-ins. <br />
<br />
Improvement using Auction house<br />
<br />
The Abyssal Crest can be sold in the Auction House. Use the money to buy Encrypted Twilight Texts, also from Auction House. It is not unreasoable to expect 5 Encrypted Twilight Texts for every Abyssal Crest, which will speed up the reputation farming considerably. <br />
