<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-21-2006, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if anyone had tried stacking haste in cat form.  If so, could you please post some numbers from pre/post haste?  I'm not in the financial position to run these tests right now, but I'd love to see the difference between using 8 agi or 8 str librams versus 1% haste (and 1% haste to gloves, maybe even counterweight, if it affects feral forms, although I don't believe so).  I'm looking at building a PvE cat suit, which means i can drop some of the ridiculous misc stats I pick up for PvP viability.  Thanks,<br />

Our default attack speed is so fast that you don't get as much return from them as stat enchants.</div></div><hr />

But then again, I'm getting pretty weak returns from +8 agi or +8 str.  Simply put, I've already got my stats high enough.  The crit from agi is probably its one saving grace.  So I'm looking at marginal options.  Anyway, just wondering if anyone had tried this out.</div></div><hr />
