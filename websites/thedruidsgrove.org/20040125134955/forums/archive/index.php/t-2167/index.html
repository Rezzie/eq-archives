<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>herm1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My buddy and I have recently started on Sullon Zek and both have started Wood Elf Druids ( Good Deity ).  Can anyone help us with some good quadding locations for the good deities as well as some techniques for us to quad together.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laniris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Duo quadding's a trick because you don't want one person to have argo on a couple and the other person to have the others wandering his/her way...resists can make this even tougher.  I've done this a couple of times (for fun more than anything), and learned a bit.<br />
<br />
Side note: You're still going to have downtime with this, the only point is either for the xp bonus (marginal, especially at lower levels), or the ability to quad stuff you otherwise wouldn't have the mana pool for.  It's good to have someone to talk to, but don't leave the book at home.<br />
<br />
It's important that one person attempt to gain and keep argo.  Assuming you're not high enough for aoe snare (that makes keeping argo easy =), have one person start as they would a regular quad--snare them all, group them up, and start nuking.  It's not even worth the other person starting to nuke until they're below 60.<br />
<br />
Don't make the mistake of trying to transfer ago halfway through the fight--it costs way more time that its worth because it never works.  Have one person keep argo on the now 'better than half dead' mobs while the other person runs along and blasts away.  Because hate 'decays' over time, it's possible that at lower health the quad will still split, but you'll get a feel for that pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
Finally, it's important to remember that one of the biggest factors in argo is how close you are to the mob.  While it requires a little dexterity, the best way to have the second person nuke is for the first person to make relatively big circles around the second person, staying relatively close to the mob.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm making it sound more complex than it is, I don't think you'll have too much trouble after a little bit of work.  The ideal kind of mob for this is one that's just a couple of levels too high for you to quad on your own, but you'll have to look in the archives or come back with some kind of level description for anyone to give you more specific advice than that.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Every time I've done this, we've used a relatively straight path in a wide open space (EW in lower levels) or in a more confined area (PoV Caves) we've picked &quot;nuke points&quot; and just ran around to those following each other and trying to nuke at the same time from the same place.  If both druids stay close to each other, it doesn't matter who has the aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Duo quadding allows for quadding of even or yellow mobs.  The trick is for one druid to do all the snaring and nuking until LOM.  Once the first druid is spent, the other druids lays in with his nukes.  This guarantees that the pack will stay on the first druid.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Another method is for both druids to nuke at the same time from the same spot.  Again the pack will stay together.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DyllwinDW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That sounds like a good strat, but I would suggest Egress over Succor so there's no chance you will take the second Druid with you...Also I don't think this would work on PoP mobs, at least the ones I've fought will completely heal if you get out of aggro range...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>chenier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While I agree with on Egress over Succor, I just wanted to show that lower level druids could try this and could use Lesser Succor.<br />
<br />
Before you start trying the quad, play around with Lesser Succor and how far away you have to be to not take the other person.<br />
<br />
I really think you could have some fun with this - be sure to tell us how it works out! =)</div></div><hr />
