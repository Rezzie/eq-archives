I have, however, heard it happens to people on the correct entrance.<br />

I figured it was a full dungeon.  But wouldn't you think that they could come up with something better than &quot;too dangerous right now&quot;?

The message is a little ambiguous any word from Sony what this actually means or are they trying to hide a nasty error behind an uninformed roleplaying style message.<br />
<br />
As for the instances being full I don't think it is as I mainly play offpeak.  Do people see these messages coming up more often in peak time or weekends?<br />
<br />
In all cases we ran back to the wayfarer's grabbed a new mission and went on our way.<br />
<br />
Could this be an error where you are assigned an instance yet when you are ready to enter the number is taken by another group?</div></div><hr />

There's is a 20 minute (or something) minimum time required before you can enter a dungeon again, right after you have just finished an adventure (whether successful or not).<br />
<br />
To the posters earlier, did you just finish an adventure, then get a new adventure immediately, then as a result you got the message?<br />
<br />
I'd like to confirm whether there is really a minimum time requirement between dungeon adventures.</div></div><hr />

We petitioned both times -- one guide said some dungeon zones were down and being restarted, and ours was one of them.  The other said it happened when a zone type was full.  /shrug  In both cases we were able to get a new adventure and enter it (a failure without anyone entering does not count as a failure on the win/loss board).</div></div><hr />

Had a conversation with GM on Mith Marr when it happened to my group.  We had to abort the adventure, take the loss and get a new adventure.  Worked fine then at same entrance.  GM suggested we /bug it so maybe if we all do it when it happens, they might actually fix it.<br />

I've had this happen to me since the first weekend of LDoN.  It seemed to only happen when we finished an adventure in around 30 minutes, and went to get another.  I'm not sure if that truely was the case though.  Reforming our group, or even camping, didn't seem to help.  Eventually we quit the adv and got another.  After a few tries, we were able to zone in.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you can't even request a new adventure during this time.  You get a message like, &quot;You need to rest some before you cfan request a new adventure.&quot;  I believe this happens if you try to get a new adventure 30mins after zoning into (note: not requesting) an adventure.</div></div><hr />
