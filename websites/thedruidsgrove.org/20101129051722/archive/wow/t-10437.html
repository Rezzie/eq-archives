What about a priest.  Are they sort of like warlocks, near impossible for a druid.  I dont know, I dueled one last night, I was level 40 and he was level 39.  We dueled like 5 times and he owned me everyone of them.  I tried cat and stealth but its useless with the shield they have up.  Then they fear me, i break it once but then im getting feared again.  Tried bear also, barely touched him.  Whas going on.</div></div><hr />

HAhahahh. <br />

Good shadow priests will usually own us every time.  I was pretty impressed with the class b/c of the firm beat downs they had handed me, so I actually rolled one.  <br />

Because all of their damage is spell based, going bear from will only help for the added hp.  Only real chance is to sneak up on them in cat form and get a few quick combo points, then rip, then pop out and heal yourself quickly, root them and nuke.  With 1.10 priests shields only have a 15sec cooldown, so they can more or less shield themselves endlessly.  Its a big drain on mana for them, but the whole time they are running around shielded we are getting melted by Shadow Word Pain and Mind Flays.</div></div><hr />

It's far less painful and less of a blow to the ego than when you are dead within a few seconds and they are their shielded, near full hp and /kek *sigh*</div></div><hr />

For a duid versus a priest I just have to think your playing the role of rogue.  Watch their mana.  Your best bet is to rip into them with a frenzy when they are low mana.  Going after them at full health is like going after a fire mage on a full tank. OUCH.  I have watched shadow priests for a long time now and have wanted to make one.  THe times I have dueled them or entered friendly flagged pvp with one they tend to, sorry to use the phrase...&quot;melt my face&quot;.  Warlocks are just as nasty.  They can make for a very short fight leaving  you helpless.</div></div><hr />
