with the current best gear and gems? <br />
It doesent have to be balanced at all considering other stats... Im just wondering what would be the highest possible crit chance for a feral druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-21-2008, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The formula is:<br />
<br />
Crit cap (percentage) = 100 - [glancing blow chance] - [chance to miss] - [chance to be dodged] - [chance to be parried]<br />
<br />
If you get the hit cap (142 hit rating) and the expertise cap (89 expertise rating), your attacks will never miss and never be dodged or parried.  Therefore only your glancing blows would be a problem.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Glancing_blow<br />
<br />
This states that glancing blows on mobs above your level (eg raid bosses) is &quot;about 20%&quot;.<br />
<br />
So if you are hit capped and expertise capped, your crit cap would be 80%.<br />
<br />
Something quite interesting happens if you reach 80% crit, expertise cap, and hit cap;  you will never do a normal hit.<br />
Because of the way WoW maths works with tables, you will only ever get glancing blows and critical strikes.<br />
<br />
If you have 0 hit rating and 0 expertise, your crit cap against a raid boss would be:<br />
100 - 20 - 9 - 6 = 65%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also note that the above only applies to your white damage.<br />
Your special abilities such as mangle and shred will never glance.<br />
Therefore if you reach the hit cap (79 hit rating for these special attacks) and expertise cap, your crit cap for mangle/shred/etc is 100%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-21-2008, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A useful page here that talks about the expertise cap.<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Expertise<br />
<br />
Expertise against Bosses<br />
<br />
A Boss-mobs parry is increased by 0.04 for every point of weapon skill it has over your level based defense, and its dodge is increased by 0.04 for every point of level based defense it has over your level based defense. At level 70 you have 350 level based defense. At level 73 a Boss-mob has 365 level based Defense and Weapon Skill, giving it 0.04*15 additional parry and dodge %. Meaning it gains 0.6% to Dodge and Parry. Ontop of it's base 5% parry, this gives a total of 5.6%. To negate 5.6% dodge and parry 23 points of expertise (or 89.7 points of expertise rating) are needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, an Elitist Jerks rogue guide disagrees, and claims the cap is 103 expertise rating.<br />
<br />
http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t16940-roguecraft_101_a/<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet another EJ post suggests 91 expetise rating.<br />
<br />

<br />
Second entry from the bottom of the &quot;Melee&quot; section.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary, I guess..  I plan to start stacking expertise until I stop seeing dodges in WoW Web Stats readouts.<br />

<br />
First off, that's one HELL of a first post... thank you very much, and welcome to the board :)<br />
<br />
secondly... it has been brought to my attention that there's a pretty serious improvement needed for my gear. I was thinking that i was doing fairly well with my ~36% chance to crit (fully buffed)... Looks like i better get steppin on the endgame content...</div></div><hr />
