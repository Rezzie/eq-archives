An efficient lifebloom cycle = super duper mana efficiency.<br />
<br />
As for gear, it's a matter of taste really, but the most useful stats are +healing, mp5, spirit, intellect, stamina.   (in that order, imho.. you need at least some of each though, really)<br />

Wait till your almost done questing and then respec.<br />
<br />
I recommend also dont use a addon for heal in the first time.<br />
At least not in 5-mans(u dont need it there -&gt; easy without them). <br />
It's better to learn it the harder way,<br />
where u have to think about what your doing.<br />
When u get into raiding u can always use addons.<br />
<br />
stats are:  +healing, spirit/intellect, mp5, stamina<br />
mp5 not more important then spirit cause of &quot;Living Spirit&quot; in resto-tree. Gives you more boost to mp5 then mp5 on items itself imho.</div></div><hr />

/agree.<br />
<br />
Use level 60 - 70 to build your gear. In many chases you can get feral gear completely independent of restro gear, allowing you to build both sets.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 70, then you can make that leep; however, depending on your server, you might want to remain feral. I know on Lightbringer, Feral druids are sought after more cause they can dps and tank.<br />
<br />
Use these 10 levels to build your gear and then decide at 70 whether to switch or not. I never went to restro myself until a bit after being in a raiding guild (and winning a bunch of restro gear in Kara). I was Balance from 60 to 70.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fingers crossed, I'm hoping to get most of my gear from Kara.  <br />
<br />
Going to be helping fellow guildies get keyed as well.  That should also allow me to pick up some decent healing gear along the way.</div></div><hr />

Because of the mix we had there I picked up:<br />
2 Pieces of healing gear<br />
2 Pieces of dps leather<br />

Just one of those nights..... my off sets are starting to have more purple than my main sets...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sey</div><div class="date">12-04-2007, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want to be the best, I'd say spec resto now and start instancing in the Outlands.  The experience will make you a better end game healer.<br />
<br />
You don't have Lifebloom at 60.  So for the time being you'll develop very quick swiftmend reactions and you'll rely on nature's swiftness / healing touch.  You'll get used to dropping tree to decurse or throw big heals, and get your macros down.<br />
<br />
When you get Lifebloom (I think at 64) it will augment an already finely-tuned healing style... instead of being your core competency like all the other noob druid healers.<br />
<br />
By instance leveling as a healer through the Outlands, you'll: <br />
- Have rights on all the healing drops<br />
- Get a ton of healing practice<br />
- Learn the various dungeons and be a better heroic healer<br />
- Grind exalted with the various factions<br />
<br />
You want that exalted rep with various factions because it will buff your pre-kara healing set:<br />
- Gavel of Pure Light (Exalted Sha'tar)<br />
- Windcaller Orb (Exalted Cenarion Expedition)<br />
- Cloth healing bracers (Exalted Keepers of Time)<br />
- +35 healing glyph from Honor Hold rep<br />
- +70 healing trinkets from Lower City rep<br />
- Plenty of other revered / exalted reputation loot for healers<br />
<br />
Get your DS3 set (Moonglade).  Ok, it has strength and agility but trust me properly gemmed and glyphed and enchanted it will make you a great Kara healer.  You'll be low on intellect but that's normal for the early raiding druid healer.<br />
<br />
For gems go with the [+28% healing -2% threat] meta in your helm. Use +18 healing red gems where you can, and hybrid (+healing +spirit +int +mp5) gems elsewhere to help fulfill the meta gem requirements.<br />
<br />
For enchants go with +heal on your gloves, bracers, and weapon, +mp5 on your chest, vitality (+mp5) to boots, and subtlety (-2% threat) to cloak.</div></div><hr />

You should be lvl 63 minimum when you clear zanga. Then spec resto and ONLY do instances til at least lvl 68, go to 70 if you want. Spec back to feral and then quest through terrokar, nagrand, BEM and nether storm (most of these will be done at lvl 70). The bonus money recieved from the quests will give enough money for an epic flying mount. Easy done, healers are always wanted for instances :)<br />
<br />
If you spec resto at 70, you will find collecting money for epic flying very hard.</div></div><hr />
