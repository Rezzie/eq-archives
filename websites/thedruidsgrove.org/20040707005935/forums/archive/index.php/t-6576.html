<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here goes:<br />
<br />
1)  Get yourself to Nadox and camp the undead trolls for a Coral Ring to replace one of your Velium Rings.<br />
2)  Head to CoM and camp the goos till the named goo spawns and get a Green Slime Ring to replace the other Velium Ring.<br />
3)  If you're guilded, head to Kael and do Vindi. Get his head to start you on your PoG quest for the Gloves of the Earthcrafter.<br />
4)  GAH! Ditch the MRT for Elysian.  I'm assuming you just haven't had the luck with this drop in UP since I see you have other Elysian gear.<br />
5)  Do some LDoN Takish adventures and pick up a Dusty Girdle of Reformed Sand.<br />
6)  Perhaps do the Shield of Bane Warding quest or save up for a Tactician's Bulwark or Tae Ew Shield<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />

Forgot to mention im hoping to work solo so for it. Hehe and been to the nadox part, too much roamer =D Couldnt root/dot the crewman parts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murias</div><div class="date">02-06-2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was root/dotting the drenched crewmen in Nadox at level 60. If you go into the first tunnel that leads to the undead, there's only one pat that passes through there. Kill that one first (wait for him if you have to), then start pulling the others. I've had no less than 5 coral rings drop there while I was camping the gem inlaid longsword for my bard twink. It's not terribly rare.</div></div><hr />

You should be beaten for even suggesting that he wear that worthless overhyped piece of crap.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">02-07-2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quest is annoying, and the shield is crap.</div></div><hr />
