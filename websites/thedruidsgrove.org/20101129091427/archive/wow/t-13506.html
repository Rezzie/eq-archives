It's bonuses aren't in line with the other flasks, and it's not affected by Mixology.  <br />
<br />
Ok sure, you make it once and it's there forever... but I don't foresee myself bothering with it, as Frost Wyrm or Pure Mojo would be much more of a boost.<br />
<br />
About the only reason I see for it would be if I ran Arenas (which I don't), or for those occasions (Heroics, anyone?) where I overgear the content and it's generally a waste to flask up for it.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm missing something?<br />
<br />
Is there a Mana version of the Endless Healing Potion?  Now that I'd be interested in.<br />
<br />
edit: found it: Endless Mana Potion (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?item=43570).  Sigh.  Gives a lot less mana back than the Runic Mana Potion (1800-3000 vs 4000-4400).  Are they removing the 'one potion per combat' thing?  If so, then this would definitely be viable.  if not... meh.  I'll stick with the regular mana pots.<br />
<br />
I guess it's my 'debbie downer' day... :-(</div></div><hr />

I, too, was skeptical but then I figured I'd just go ahead and make one for when I only needed a little boost:<br />
<br />
(Heroics, anyone?)<br />
<br />
Now I use my Flask of the North (over and over) without wasting the gold or mats on a Flask of the Frost Wyrm that I'd rather save for a 25-man.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's not a bad sidearm to carry along when soloing.  <br />
<br />
I *heart* it.<br />

I use the flask of the north ALL the time, never let it drop off unless raiding with a true flask, its basically a strength or spellpower boost that costs nothing :)  <br />
<br />
for the minimal cost of mats, you would be silly not to make this, even just to use doing heroics or dailies imo.:thumbup:</div></div><hr />
