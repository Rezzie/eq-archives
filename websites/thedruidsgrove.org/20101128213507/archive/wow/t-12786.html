I've played both horde and alliance druids and though I like both factions, I always seem to find that RL friends prefer the horde for whatever reason. Because of this, I'm stuck with the godaweful Tauren cat form. Maybe for a few players, it's a face only a mother could love kind of deal, but for me...ew.  The idea is great: Taurens can transform into a Barren's lion, but the result is less than acceptable. <br />
<br />
Regardless, I've heard that Blizzard plans to revamp the Tauren cat form model for the expansion and to do the same for the Dire Bear form(so it's different form regular bear form).<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

It seems we get slightly shafted in bear/cat/moonkin/tree for because we all look the same, no matter what gear we have. I know this would be way too complicated and time consuming for blizz, but if out gear could be seen over our form that would be sweet (though probably impossible). Or make the female look...(gasp) 'cuter' in other forms, again just to look different, at least from males. I digress.. Yes, I'm excited about looking different in bear/dire bear form....</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I know Dire Cat was pulled, but I still recall hearing that they were going to make an effort to at least do something with the Tauren cat model.</div></div><hr />

However, I have also heard that it was fake and the models aren't really being redone at all.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to believe at this stage, unless someone can provide a link to a blue post or similar authoritative source that explicity mentions new models I'm just going to wait and see what I look like in WotLK :&gt;<br />
