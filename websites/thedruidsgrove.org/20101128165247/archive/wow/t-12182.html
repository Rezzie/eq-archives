Eventually, I went with Herbalism/Alchemy.  While I don't necessarily regret that combo (Hello! Battle Elixirs, my little pretties!), sometimes I really wish I'd have had the forsight to see the benefits of being able to make my own gear.  (considering Druids need at least 3 sets - sigh)<br />
<br />
Anyone else out there have professional regrets?  <br />
<br />
And, if you love your professions, how have they benefited you the most?<br />
<br />
Auctionhouse-wise, I've never really sold my potions (can't seem to ever part with them), but Herbs have made me some pretty decent money.  Sometimes Felweed and Morning Glory have added little bonuses inside, such as (3) Mote of Life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I 1st respecced to feral I too felt that I was lacking in gear and since many of the pieces that feral druids can benefit from are BoP ... I thought about switching profession.  However after discovering more end-game items such as Alchemist Stone (http://www.wowwiki.com/Alchemist%27s_Stone) and Flask of Relentless Assault (http://www.wowwiki.com/Flask_of_Relentless_Assault) and other ones ... I am enjoying the benefit of being an Alchemist/Herbalist.<br />
<br />
If you are starting to look into selling your potions/elixirs/transmutes make sure you check the Auction House for pricing.  At my server sometimes the materials sell more than the actual potion/elixir.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I wish I'd never done it.  I wish I'd done leatherworking or herbalism/alchemy.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting is pretty much a worthless profession.  Sure people need gems, but you can't sell a cut gem for more than an uncut unless its uber rare.  Most of the recipes don't sell worth a darn.  And to be perfectly honest there aren't enough really sexy looking BOP recipes to make it worth having the profession.  The recipes are impossible to get.  <br />
<br />
I'd drop JC if it weren't for the metric ton of cash I've spent on it so far.  Of course the fact that half or better of the guild looks at me to do their cuts doesn't help either...</div></div><hr />

A guildie of mine has has 20 - 40 potions/elixirs a day to get procs.  She now has every discovery, excluding 2 cauldrons b/c she doesn't have the nature resist potion or fire resist potion yet.<br />
<br />
I've been lucky enough to get back to back discoveries on my 2 alchemists ( druid and mage ).  My druid is elixir spec'd and my mage is potion.<br />
<br />
On my shaman I went mining / jewel crafting and really don't regret it.  While I don't like the fact that nearly all the designs after 360 are world drops *sigh* b/c it makes them so expensive to aquire, the benefits from cutting gems, prospecting ore, and the new jewel crafter only gems, has made it worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">11-08-2007, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would consider the benefits of being a pure gatherer as a druid. I started skinning/LW, but got frustrated by LW early on and dropped it for herbalism (I have enough bag space issues that crafting is just too much). I don't regret it in the least. Sure, the BoP pieces are nice, but I make so much money farming leather and herbs, and my guildies love me long time when I send them stacks of either. With travel form, instant cast flight form and now instant cast epic flight form, I can scoot from node to node muy pronto and farm very efficiently. Also, we don't have to &quot;dismount&quot; to farm herb nodes. Sometimes I wish I had done mining instead of skinning because my alt is a JC, but I make such obscene amounts of money from farming leather (especially clefthoof with bonus of Roasted Clefthoof), and you can only track herbs or mines one at a time.<br />
<br />
Regarding JC, I leveled my alt as soon as BC came out. I agree that guilds only need 2-3 high level JCs, and it's very expensive to level.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you choose.</div></div><hr />

Herbs is always good money (as are other gathering professions) but Alchemists Stone is a great trinket imo and a MUST HAVE if you use potions often in raids.<br />
<br />
Btw I got my flask of relentless assault discovery when a guildie gave me mats for a couple mana pots inside gruuls one time =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">11-09-2007, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-TBC I played a hunter who was a leatherworker who could make every recipe worth having.  I did combines for people as favours and helped to build fire resistance sets for my guild.  In the end though it wasn't as fulfilling as it should have been.<br />
<br />
My druid is and always has been a herbalist/alchemist.  The benefits of having a constant supply of potions, elixirs and flasks imho far outweigh the downside of having less gear available.<br />
<br />
The alchemists stone however has &quot;druid&quot; written all over it, I sincerely doubt I will replace it this side of WotLK.<br />
There honestly just isn't anythign more awesome than when 2 rogues are trying to &quot;gank&quot; me in bear form, it looks like I'm about to die, but then I instantly shift out and get a 5k health potion crit - this ends up as being an extra 6k or so health once i'm back to bear form.  Rogs are like -.-<br />
It's called justice and it is hilarious =)<br />
<br />
So yes.  Although leatherworkers get some really nice BoP items, the alchemists stone is better than all of them combined anyway (imho).  :&gt;  I am 100% glad to have the professions I chose, and I spend loads of time on them, such that I can now make every flask in the game except for Flask of Mighty Restoration.<br />

I have a screenshot of (part of) my potion collection, I'll have to post it up here when I get home tonight... :p<br />

When I created her, the idea was to sell the regents and save up for my 60 mount, starting at level 1. After she got 60 (and her 60 mount), I started actually raising her enchanting past the 40 dechant cap.<br />
<br />
Now she's a 375 herbalist and 375 enchanter.<br />
<br />
My Rogue, on the other hand, is a herbalist/alchemist. He makes all the potions/elixirs I need on any chars (instant mail send was so welcomed). I spec'd him elixir master because, to be honest, the potions I use the most are elixirs. I just never got into the habit of popping potions as if they were pez.</div></div><hr />

Maybe its just coincidence but I get most of my discoveries when I make a lot of potions.  So I usually set aside a time and save all my herbs and make all of it at once.</div></div><hr />

That would be very nice, but I bet the mats for the alchemy only would be kinda crazy. I'm hoping they incorporate primal nethers in somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really see how they could balance Nethers into Alchemy. On one hand they can make it a mat for a really good flask/pot but then it'd become the new standard for raiders (and require alchemists to farm like mad) or it could be really underpowered if they decide to make the potions only marginally better than the current ones.</div></div><hr />

OK Annikk - that's awesome!  Very impressed.  <br />

I've discovered that Super Mana Potions sell quite, quite well.  As a Tank, I find I can part with them more so than my other pots, ...so, &quot;show me the money!&quot;  :biggrin:</div></div><hr />
