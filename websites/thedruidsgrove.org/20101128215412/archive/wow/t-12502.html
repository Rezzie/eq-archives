I only wish I knew this sooner lol. with that said I have two weapons I would like to compare and get some advice on they are<br />
<br />
Ironshod bludgeon (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9408) and The Rockpounder (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9413)<br />
<br />
Also with that said I was using +5 dmg weapon enchants, since weapon dmg is not a factor in feral dmg is there any benifit from an enchant in weapon dmg?</div></div><hr />

Really at that level I don't worry about critical strike bonus.  Raw stats and  you'll outlevel it quickly anyway.</div></div><hr />

Defintely use the Ironshod Bludgeon. No point in putting +dam on it but +crit works actually. Just FYI. Look at stats on a weapon purely. Don't worry about AP if you are Feral. It will come. Focus on Sta, Agi, and Str.</div></div><hr />

Other than that there is no point.  The enchant that you will eventually want to get is a +35agi (or I guess Savagrey), but no point in spending the G to get that till you are 70.<br />
<br />
IMO search the AH for a Blanchard's Stout.  Should be able to pick one up for about 15 - 20g, and that should last you till Outland.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">04-02-2008, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on what you're focusing on. In PvP you want burst damage (%crit). In PvE instances and in Raids you want sustained DPS. Burst damage pulls aggro and is to spiky to be reliable. It's great for Ravaging gnomes though. :biggrinfl <br />
<br />
So the bottom line for that decision is what's more important for what you are trying to do? You're essentially deciding between 80 Health or about 12.25 AP. 14 AP = +1 DPS. In most cases I'd go with the health. Bear tanking, soloing, PvP'ing... all will rely on you being alive longer. If you're looking for maximizing your burst damage in Kitty form, then the Rockpounder will accomodate. But it's a niche only you'll know if you are filling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, on all weapons, feral druids should ignore the dps, max/min damage, and speed.<br />
The only things that are important are any stats on the item, eg agility, stamina, strength, crit chance, hit chance, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapon damage enchants of the kind you are speaking about do not affect your feral forms.  Agility enchants are your best bet.  :&gt;<br />
