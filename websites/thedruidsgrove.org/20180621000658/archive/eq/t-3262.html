Since PoP has been released, I figure that now is a good time to revisit all the slots, starting with perhaps the most important one.<br />
<br />
A reminder:  this is a discussion, slot by slot, of the various equipment pieces available to druids. Since it's the &quot;Best of the Best,&quot; I will exclude some of the lowest level options for convenience.  I also will be examining the options from the perspective of a Level 65 Druid that does a lot of higher level raiding, as well as single group and solo XPing. <br />
<br />
I won't attempt to come up with an &quot;index value&quot; or anything similar, which can be misleading.  The goal is to provoke druids to look critically at the various options they have, and also to provide some guidance as to reasonable upgrades or alternatives. <br />
<br />
I very well may overlook some item; if so, post it here and I will add it to the main list. And, of course, feel free to criticize my analysis and/or opinions, and state your own...:)   <br />
<br />
Note that I have dropped the Starweave Tunic from the list, due to its lack of availability.   I am only looking at things that a druid can acquire in the game on a production server.<br />

Discussion:<br />
<br />
Tough choice between two top contenders, and it will largely depend on what you need (if you are lucky enough to have a choice). <br />
<br />
The KST is best for overall stats.  Phenomenal HP and mana, with mixed resists.   It has an offensive effect that is very nice for a druid in almost any circumstance:  our highest damage DoT, castable in 3 seconds.   <br />
<br />
The Mail of Judgment has substantially more AC and better balanced resists, but quite frankly, I think a high level druid at this point in the game is going to be well beyond the soft cap so the additional AC won't be significant.  What is really important here is how much the druid in question can use the FT on the MoJ.   If the druid is already at the FT 15 cap, or close to it, the FT on the MoJ is not that important.   If you're below the cap, I can see a strong argument for going with the MoJ.   No real wrong choice here.<br />
<br />
Third choice is the Ancient Burrower Hide Tunic, which has it all (AC, HP, Mana, Wis, and resists) but at lower levels. <br />
<br />
Notice the new entry of a TAILORED BP...the Trilounhide Tunic.  Decent stats and 90 HP and mana.  No effect, though, but for a crafted item, it is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Previously, there was a toss-up between the Elysian, Kael and Skyshrine BPs, which were all fairly comparable (except for the missing RoG on the Elysian).  With the new Wanderer's Sylvan Tunic, there's a better choice all around.  It has comparable or slightly better stats, AND the upgrade to RoG as the effect.  <br />
<br />
Once you drop below 20 AC, there are a lot of options, including some new Luclin BPs. IMO, however, the ES BP, with good AC, wis, mana and the chloroplast effect still is the best in this range. Ironically, however, a druid that is Trakanon-capable is much more likely to get an Elysian BP before an ES BP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing to add about the Judgement BP is the 10% alteration IS apparent to those in the Evo Specialization, I am unsure about those who specialize Alteration.<br />
<br />
1 Fizzle can = 250-300 mana difference, IE: 50 mana on the BP doesn't make up for that on the new Elemental BP.<br />
<br />
As for AC - I am now starting to lose AC greatly by upgrading to the new gear. (This was SoE's intent I believe)<br />
<br />
I was around 1549 full buffed and now I am in the 1400's range full buffed (raid).<br />
<br />
Is there a difference, sure was - 1350 + I saw a major difference, old world mobs especially and deeper into SOL. But you have to ask yourself a question.. if there was this &quot;priest/dru&quot; softcap.. why wouldn't they just continue on the same trend with AC as they did in SoL? <br />
<br />
The other concern is the consentration of FT on the BP. If I move to the new elemental BP, I will have to change 1 - 2 items in other slots to make of the difference at this time.. speaking about Time.. we just don't know what the Plane of Time and its treasures will hold.. so /sarcasm.. only time will tell.<br />
<br />
There are others out there that had greater AC then me.. let them talk and discuss this issue also.</div></div><hr />

The FT on the MOJ is massive compared to alot of other slots. So when people say they have FT18 or something what this means is they can swap out maybe a FT3 item slot which normally you would be reluctant to swap out because the MOJ is keeping your FT cap nice and high. Id still chose the MOJ of the Elemental BP personally but we no longer do VT (considered old world now) and well elemental probably going to be my only choice.<br />
