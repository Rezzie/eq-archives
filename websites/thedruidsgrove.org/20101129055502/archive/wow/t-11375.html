Roots is so random I don't even trust the talents that supposedly upgrade it.</div></div><hr />

I don't bother with Imp Entangling Roots just cuz Naturalist is way better, imo.  Besides, Engtangling roots are pretty much meant for melee classes hitting on u.  If you go bear form and cast this.  youl'll be able to sustain the damage long enough for it to proc.  At least, that's what I do. :)<br />

EDIT:  This assumes you're picking up furor of course, that's why I didn't even bother to mention it earlier.</div></div><hr />

I'm still debating whether or not I'm happy with it.  On one hand, NG has saved my bear (or other forms) arse a multitude of times.  It is one of the best strategies we have when running the flag in WSG and it helps with crowd control in both PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it's really useless if you zerged by a Whole Bunch of the opposing side or you aggro 6 mobs in Silithus.  Rooting one person in a crowd of 10 doesn't really sway the battle at all or allow you to run away with out being a Dead Kitty.<br />
<br />
And I miss OoC.  So, if they refund talents when BC comes out, I'm not sure if I'll go the NG way.  I guess I'm on the fence.  There, does that help? /grin</div></div><hr />
