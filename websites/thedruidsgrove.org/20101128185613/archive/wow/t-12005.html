 <br />
I can't seem to find it, and I know it had a few more add-ons than ItemRack and Wardrobe.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Anyways, I need a good add-on for swapping out my gear quickly.  ItemRack and Wardrobe are both outdated (or at least they are where I downloaded them).  Does anybody know of another one?  Or better yet, an updated version of either ItemRack or Wardrobe?  I've searched and I'm either finding the wrong sites or the wrong downloads.  Yeesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">08-30-2007, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Itemrack - there is an 'unofficial' version at WoWInterface (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=6818) that is supposed to be updated with a couple of bug fixes. Check the posts down the page for the 2.1c version.  I haven't tried it yet, but I did just download it for my use, although I have been using the 'official' 2.1 version with no problems so far.<br />
<br />
I believe the discussion you were looking for is the  Post Your Interface (http://thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/showthread.php?t=11814&amp;page=5d) thread, page 5.<br />
<br />
Other addons mentioned were ClosetGnome (http://files.wowace.com), Wardrobe-AL (&quot;http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/2183/), and Outfitter (&quot;http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/4784/).</div></div><hr />

And yeah, that was the thread I was searching for.  Heh.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if you have a conflict between ItemRack and some other mod.</div></div><hr />

Hmm what is not working?  Has been working just fine for me as well.  Like Raging mentioned might be an issue with another mod perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrækLord</div><div class="date">09-02-2007, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is a mod of some sort.  A bunch of stuff went weird when I put in like two more mods.  My S key doesn't work after about 5 minutes and there's no music whatsoever.  Even in the login part.  I'm gonna have to go in and get rid of all the mods I recently downloaded and hope that works.<br />
If not, I'll have to run the Cleanup thing.  :P<br />
