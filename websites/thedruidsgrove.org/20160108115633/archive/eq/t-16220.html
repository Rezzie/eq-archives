 <br />
Often too, I'm expected to be a full part of the healers, as sometimes we have only 3 or 4 clerics.<br />
 <br />
With this in mind I'm asking what would generally be the best debuff to use, especially as sometimes I only get time to cast one?<br />
 <br />
I try and fire off HoR if time at the start of engaging the named mobs, then if healing seems capable and the mob seems locked down, I throw on StV. Then add my epic when mob is 40-50% or so.<br />
 <br />
So the two questions are.<br />
 <br />
1. If I only have time to fire off one or two debuffs, which two and which order would be best?<br />
 <br />
2. If on the other hand I have plenty of time to debuff, what would be an optimum cycle and order?<br />
 <br />
HoR<br />
SC<br />
Stv<br />
Blistering Sun.<br />
Hoar Frost?<br />
 <br />
And do they all stack?<br />
 <br />
I have a full set of spells, all rank2, and we are currently in Tacvi and Anguish.<br />
 <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally i split debuffs in this order (cus we have 2 or 3 druids usually)<br />
<br />
HoR, then Fixation for one druid<br />
Blistering Sunray, then Corona/Hoar for me (then stv if it's useable)<br />
Icefall for the other (he's a raid leader so only gets one :p)<br />
<br />
That way at least i know we're debuffing resists as much as possible right off the bat to help further debuffs land and so that DPS starts as soon as it's needed.<br />
<br />
As for landing two, i guess it depends on what you're fighting and which classes you have in raid.. Can go for more atk, ac or fire resist debuffing, or ice debuff+dmg mod etc.</div></div><hr />

I always keep up HoR because it only lasts for 3 minutes and most encounters go longer than that unless you have some massive DPS.</div></div><hr />

Typically this only happens when we are fighting multiple mobs at the same time, meaning that I am the sole druid for one mob _and_ responsible for a good portion of the healing on that mob.  The first event in Deathknell comes to mind.</div></div><hr />

Hand of Ro<br />
 I try and fire off HoR if time at the start of engaging the named mobs, then if healing seems capable and the mob seems locked down, I throw on StV. Then add my epic when mob is 40-50% or so.<br />
<br />
StV is situational.  It can't be used on Summoned or Undead.  Since healing is limited that makes Sun's Corona the second best Debuff to use.<br />
<br />
Additonally you are starting to do encounters which run 5+ minutes based on the items I see on your Magelo.  Using your Epic early on may thus allow for a second click when the mob gets low.<br />
 <br />
1. If I only have time to fire off one or two debuffs, which two and which order would be best?<br />
<br />
Hand of Ro &amp; Sun's Corona<br />
<br />
2. If on the other hand I have plenty of time to debuff, what would be an optimum cycle and order?<br />
 <br />
Hand of Ro<br />
Icefall Breath<br />
Hoar Frost<br />
Fixation of Ro<br />
Skin to Vines<br />
Blistering Sunray<br />
<br />
I would move Sunray to before Fixation if your having a hard time landing Fixation due to innate fire resistance.<br />
<br />
 And do they all stack?<br />
