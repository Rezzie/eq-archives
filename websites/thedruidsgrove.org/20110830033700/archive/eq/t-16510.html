 <br />
There is write up on it here and you need to kill in icefall to get 4 quests done before hand but that will give you better exp...is it 75 the required level for sublime? I would get those since you said money isn't object.<br />
 <br />
Also work on the tss charm from ground spawns and your wanderlust aug for that charm until you are 80 to get tinymans.<br />
 <br />
You are suffering on focus effects due to all the jewelry so look for flame viel for face for spell haste I believe or detri spell range.<br />
 <br />
Mana and hps are great but focus effects are even better :p<br />
 <br />
also buy scratch hide arms and get 35% to fire focus.</div></div><hr />

You can get some scratched armor SoF items in the bazaar or via grouping in tier 2.   These will be pricey, but they will have an enormous impact on your character.  Look for a heal focus (the Katta ally chest piece has one; there are some nonvisible SoF armor pieces that also do) and look for spell haste focii.</div></div><hr />
