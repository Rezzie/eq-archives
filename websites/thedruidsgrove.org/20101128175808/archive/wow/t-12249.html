<br />
I'm like a kid in the candy store; I go and look at what each side has to offer and then I cant make up my mind get frustrated and don't chose a side. Maybe y'all can make my mind up for me?<br />
<br />
lvl 70 Feral <br />
Tribal LW / Skinning<br />
<br />
My main concern at this point in game is tanking, I'm trying to piece my tanking set together and really not to concerned with kitty gear. I don't currently raid and don't see that changing anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me the only difference (http://www.wowwiki.com/Comparison_of_Aldor_and_Scryer_rewards) are the shoulder enchants (Inscriptions (http://www.wowwiki.com/Augments#Inscriptions)).  The Honored version only, as I doubt I'd ever make it to Exalted.  Scryer == +13 defense, Aldor == +13 Dodge Rating.<br />
<br />
I went with Scryer for 4 reasons, I figured I'd need defense (I'm only lvl 62, so I can't say for sure), I have a Hunter alt that is Scryer so I can use him to grind on the rings to maximize rep, I'm already familar with the Scryer tier and (most importantly) the Scryer tier, and bank, is closer to the FP and Lower City &quot;stuff&quot; I access often.<br />
<br />
If you don't care, or have an opinion, about the last 3 items.  Then, I guess, it comes down to +def or +dodge.  Or in your case, does one have better LW patterns (http://www.wowwiki.com/Comparison_of_Aldor_and_Scryer_rewards/Crafting_Recipes)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For anything but a Boomkin I'd recommend Aldor.  Aldor has stronger healing gear and it also has a much better shoulder enchant.  For Druid tanks, +dodge is way better than +defense.  I have been over the defense cap for ages.  Hell the Clefthide set alone has 90% of what you need.  Slot a few gems and you are golden.  The defense cap is easy to hit, and the dodge bonus is huge for druid tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went scryer because of the tanking (heavier +defense) and melee (heavier +crit) because druids in bear form are eternally hurting for defense and in cat form, the RoR on crit/agility is just gross and disgustingly good all the way up to the crit cap (75%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">12-11-2007, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the clefthide set gives higher defense but our Tier sets give none. If you tank you need to go scryer cause the higher level of gear you get the harder you are going to find good defense gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't forget the most important reason to choose scryer though.<br />
<br />
When you run off the platform you don't die from falling damage. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">12-11-2007, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See I have so much backup gear plus resilience stuff, I'm way over the cap.  I'm much happier having +dodge than +defense right now.  But as always that comes with a heaping helping of &quot;personal preference&quot;.  I've never had any problem hitting the defense cap and in fact I'm having to back down my defense because I'm way over the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-11-2007, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allahanastar, I'd have to see how you're gearing then. I am always stretching to be uncrittable without stacking large amounts of pvp gear. Right now, to be uncrittable, I need 2 pvp peices, plus defense rings, neck, cape, enchants (no gems anymore though, thankfully).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">12-11-2007, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At exalted, the differences between Aldor and Scryer Inscriptions are less significant.  One is +10dodge, +15 def, the other is +15def, +10dodge.<br />
<br />
So, grind to exalted so it doesn't matter. :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

At honored, Aldor gives +26 AP, whereas Scryer gives +13 crit.  AP is readily available, crit is harder to come by.  I'd take +crit over +AP.  Though at the levels these inscriptions give it probably doesn't mater all that much.<br />
<br />
Again, at Exalted, the differences are minor as both give +AP and +crit.</div></div><hr />

BAD druid! That's the reason to take Aldor, not Scryer. Once you hit 68 it's dramatic to run off the edge of Aldor Rise and see everybody LOL until you instant cast flight form at the last second FTW. All druids intuitively know this. I'm amazed you missed it, Oh flying bear of doom. BAD druid!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">12-24-2007, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Flip a coin; the difference between the 2 factions' rewards is negligable. I agree. Kinda. You wouldn't flip a coin to decide your toons gender would you?<br />
<br />
I can't stand draeaeienaeieaie. So. I've gone Scryer.<br />
<br />
I think it would be wrong to design the two factions to be &quot;for&quot; different classes, specs, group roles, etc. I would hate to grind to 58 and get to Shattrath only to find out I have to hang out with a bunch of retarded space paladins or gimp my toon. That would be a nauseating choice.<br />
<br />
So. Blizzard did the clever thing, and instead made the differences between the two factions real but negligible. Choosing your race is about as important. And y'know what? There's been a bunch of blue posts that reveal their attitude in that regard. Which can be summed up as:<br />
<br />
Do what you want.<br />
<br />
Choose the race/class/faction you want, that appeals to you personally. Whatever distinctions or differences there may be, they are minor.<br />
<br />
I couldn't stand levelling a dorf priest, or Aldor, or whatever. No offense to those that chose to go that way. It's just not what I want. Which you could say I am entitled to do, otherwise why pay $15 a month.</div></div><hr />

QFT :P<br />
<br />

<br />
I personally chose The Aldors :)<br />
<br />
Well the rewards at Exalt doesn't really that much, like what AppleJax said, &quot;Do whatever you want, otherwise why pay $15 a month.&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

It opens up into the Aldor area, and some of the Aldor mobs will aggro on you. Just a heads up. What I do is: exit the tunnel, turn right, hug the rockface till the slight drop into the Scryer area. Those moon paladins don't play, they'll teleport your butt right out of the city.</div></div><hr />

It's on aldor terrace at the back left side.  It's just a tunnel leading from aldor terrace through the mountain and out into Nagrand.<br />

<br />
Coming out of the Aldor Inn, it's to the left, up an incline.  Vague directions, I know, but that's the best I can give without further investigation :rolleyes: .  It's actually not easily discovered.  I came upon it by accident.  <br />
<br />
As for how I chose Aldor or Scryer, I did A LOT of research into the matter.  I was told that Aldor were the good guys, and Scryers were the bad guys.  LOL - silly assessment, but that's all it took.  <br />
<br />
I'm a good girl :wink: - so decision made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it would be easiest to find it if you were in Nagrand. The Nagrand side of the tunnel is in the south-east corner of the map. The Shatt side of the tunnel is in the south-west corner of the map, almost between the Aldor and Scryer areas, but definitely on the Aldor side. :p If you're scryer, take the little elevator up then hug the rockwall, following it clockwise.</div></div><hr />

I just thought Alliance may have more use for the tunnel as (I think) it is closer to their stronghold in Nagrand.  Whereas the Horde have no real reason to use it as our Nagrand city is easily accessed along the road from NW exit of Shat.<br />
<br />
Though, once you have the FP (and/or flight form), why would you ever use the tunnel?<br />
<br />
I was just wonder why I've never seen it.  Maybe 'cause both my toons are Horde.  I'm currently questing Nagrand with my Druid (hit lvl 68 last night).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Your hearthstone's CD isn't up.<br />
2. You can access SE Nagrand very quickly.<br />
3. The roads are being camped.<br />
4. Show noobs they still have much to learn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Attention avid readers of TDG:<br />
The previous posts, some by me, some not, have spread misinformation and politically-fuelled propaganda with regard to the Shattrath/Nagrand tunnel conspiracy.<br />
The actual route to get there is a little more complicated.  To simplify things, I have split it up into 8 ezmode steps.  With the right attitude and determination, a player should be able to accomplish this in no more than an afternoon.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Go to the auction house - it doesn't matter which one.  Buy some [Fire Oil] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6371).  5 should be plenty.<br />
<br />
2.  Head to Winterspring.  In the far southwest of the zone you will find a complex of fire-scarred caves, similar in appearance to Blasted Lands, and populated by demons.<br />
<br />
3.  Sprinkle the Fire Oil liberally on the Ice Coated Statue in the cave area 2nd from the bottom on the far upper right (assuming you start facing west).  You may need to use more than one Fire Oil to get the statue to proc.  If you have any Fire Oil left over afterwards, it's best to just drink it so it won't take up bag space.<br />
<br />
4.  Take the resulting portal, whereupon you appear at the top of Mount Hyjal.  A gnome NPC here called Smokey LaRue gives a quest called Shattrath to Nagrand - The Truth (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1127).  The quest involves speaking to an npc in southwest Ungoro Crater.  Head there.<br />
<br />
5. The NPC in Ungoro Crater is called Tinklewhizz Buckblast, a gnome engineer.  Upon handing in, he gives a new quest entitled &quot;Saving Gnomeregan&quot;.  This quest requires you to bring Tinklewhizz the sum of 50,000g to buy back gnomeregan from the goblins and save gnomekind forever.<br />
<br />
6.  Once you have the money, hand it in to Tinklewhizz and he will reveal to you the secret location of Deathwing's Lair.  There is also a reward associated with turning in this quest, a key allowing entry to Deathwing's Lair.  It is called [The Shiniest Jewel] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=5429).<br />
<br />
7.  Now you must gather a 25 man raid force and proceed directly to Deathwing's Lair.  All members of the raid group must have completed the questline up to this point, and have the Shiniest Jewel in their bags/keyrings.  For a full description of the Deathwing Encounter, see here. (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1352)<br />
<br />
8.  Upon defeating Deathwing, he drops an item which starts a quest - everyone can loot this.  The quest is called Shattrath to Nagrand - Captain Placeholder's Master Plan. (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=20239)  Head to Aldor Terrace now, where - through divine portents of extreme mysticism - the ghost of Captain Placeholder will be revealed to you.  Speak to him to handin the quest, and he will now open the portal through the mountains to Nagrand, and victory.<br />
The portal is extremely unstable and lasts only 5 minutes before collapsing.  It's a once-per-character per-server event, so make sure you aren't about to crash or disconnect, start the timer, then high tail it over to The Hole of Bother in middle-west Shadowmoon Valley.  You will find the entrance to the portal at the back of the cave complex there, and with any luck you should be able to ride straight through to the other side.<br />
Congratulations!  How does it feel to be in Nagrand?! :&gt;<br />
