The North American Interactive Druid Talent preview is just around the corner. Hang in there, I know it's exciting information. In fact, I've been having a blast playing around with the new talents for the last few weeks on an internal build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-23-2005, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's a quick jist from one of the posts (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-druid&amp;t=432129&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post432129) on the forums:	 1.8 Druid talent viewer in korean official homepage.<br />
<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.co.kr/info/talent/druids/talents.html<br />
<br />
Hasn't this new talent not yet publicated in English? I searched for a while but couldnt.<br />
I guess most of you guys can grasp roughly what our new talent will be like by icons and numbers..<br />
<br />
Hmm.. Then I will review most interesting features in the new tree, for you guys =3<br />
<br />
1.Moonkin form - 31th of balance tree, gives druid 360% increased armor and kind of buff aura that increases chance to get a critical strike of spells of party members within a radius of 30 yards. can use only spells of balance school in this form.<br />
<br />
2. Leader of the pack(may be wrong) - 31th of feral tree, gives druid a kind of buff aura that increases chance to get a critical strike of melee or ranged attaks of party members within a radius of 45 yards, when druid is in cat form, bear form or dire bear form.<br />
<br />
3. Furor and intensity are integrated into one talent. The same for fairy fire(cat, bear).<br />
<br />
4. Omen of clarity and weapon of the nature(&lt;-balance of the nature) are reformed. It will affect all kinds of melee attacks. Omen will get rid of not only mana cost but also rage and energy required for next attack(and healing).<br />
<br />
5. Natural shapeshifter(&lt;- swiftshifting) changed to 10,20,30 % instead of 20,40,60% but not require 'within 6 seconds'. In other words, this talent reduces mana cost of shapeshifts up to 30%.<br />
<br />
6. Essence of the wild - great. intelligence increses 4%~20%. In addition stamina increases 4%~20% in bear form or dire bear form, strength increases in catform.<br />
<br />
7. Improved healing touch - reduces the cast time of healing touch 0.1 ~ 0.5 sec.<br />
<br />
8. Insect swarm - 11th of restoration tree. decreses target enemy's chance to hit and causes nature damage.<br />
<br />
Other features are more understandable with ease, by icons and numbers, i guess.<br />
<br />
And one more important information in case you dont know, hurricane will not be a talent skill any more. It can be bought by skill trainers.<br />
<br />
p.s. sorry to cay, I didn't intend to be one who deliver this news, I just wanted to know where english version of this viewer would be.. :/<br />
<br />
p.s.2. Korean is a very subtle and exquiste language, and has an entirely different way of forming sentences. You may not as well expect web interpreter could translate korean into something tangible. :)<br />
In the words of an old guild mate; OMG OMG OMG OMG</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure 1.8 patch notes won't show until they put it on Test, as before.<br />
<br />
As for 1.6 live/1.7 test, just from browsing our news forum, July 16th and August 18th, so about a month.</div></div><hr />

Do you all think that these benneficial auras will work on the druid themselves. Man, Imagine the AE groups you could join as a Balance SPec. +350% Armor tanking and MF/SF everywhere to keep aggro, the whole time all the mages fire off their AE's which already have increased crit chances.<br />
<br />
*edit Or, oftank GOD with leader of the pack. Plus OoC procing then using frenzied regen. Full health and no Rage decrease. OOOOOOH Sounds like so much fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds good,<br />

NERF DRUIDS!!! ok not really. Just had to say I am glad that I am not going to be forced into the resto build. I mean its fine to choose it at endgame to bring more to a group, but it sounds like  our end talents are all helpful to a group.<br />

I hate being pigeon holed so you can guess how bad I mouthed off when they tried to blame us (Druids) for the priests not having enough mana.<br />

<br />
When a priest/raid leader relies on Intervate, you know there's something amiss.<br />
<br />
I've been on plenty of difficult encounters and not one of them *required* intervate at all. Hell, a few of them I've intervated the mage cause I saw he/she was near oom and priest was just fine (45%). I did it just cause, not cause it was required.</div></div><hr />

This really makes the other talent trees a viable option.   I'll be curious to see some new raid makeups with the two different auras that'll be given.  I'll still shoot for restoration, but crap, that moonkin, and leader of the pack looks enticing.  All in all, good job DEVS!!!</div></div><hr />

 As a matter of fact...<br />
<br />
Along with the new innovations regarding storm summoning, the Cenarion Circle has instituted endurance training of sorts for their members. The intense spell training they've undergone has allowed them to cast Tranquility every five minutes, with 25% less mana cost.<br />
 With full Cenarion, [Tranquility is] a 2.5 minute cooldown now, it appears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pvp a lot these days, thinking of a 32 bal, 19 rest build would enable me to do what I want. Only issue is how can I live without the NS/In build that I've had forever!? Lol should be fun to play around on test. Need to make sure I have plenty of cash to spend on respecs there.<br />

I love the Hurricane change. With that and the bug swarm I can actually AE a little bit now:)</div></div><hr />

As an already balanced druid, I always hoped I would get much love in 1.8.  It looks as if I am going to be smothering in love.  I am already geared as an arcane casting druid (no, I don't spam moonfire), and this change will make my previous decisions not in vain.  I do 1100+ crits with starfire at my level, and the moonkin bonus is going to be &quot;teh fo shizzle.&quot;  I was really not far from respeccing to restoration, but that will not be happening now.  Thanks Blizz for finally showing some love to the children of nature.</div></div><hr />

Brace yourself guys when people start seeing high armored moonkins nuking people in BGs. The forums will be flooded with complaints.<br />

<br />
It's a shame you can't get Nature's Swiftness and Moonkin, that would be my dream build :) So, as I am still primarily a healer, I'll stay in Restoration at the moment. But I'll be copying my character over to Test just to see what the Balance stuff looks like :)<br />

First, making Improved healing touch, instead of Nature's Focus, required for Nature's Swiftness.  I also don't like that Tranquil Spirit only affects Healing Touch and Tranquility.  It is like they want to force you to use Healing Touch.<br />
<br />
Overall, I look forward to the changes as they allow all of us more viable talent spec options.  However, to me at least, Restoration is going to be jumbled up in a way that I don't like.</div></div><hr />

I already cut down lots of horde in PvP even with my squishy current form.<br />
<br />
The feral tree isn't getting as much attention in posts but I'm pretty impressed with that. Yay to the dodge bonus, thanks Blizzard on that, and Heart of the Wild is awesome, wait till it sinks in to people how much that will help, some will choose it over Moonkin.</div></div><hr />

I never use HT just because the casting time was way too long. Now its cut down with the talent I probably will use it more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">09-24-2005, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it a lot, especially when I'm the main healer. For &quot;Oh s*&quot; instances I cast regrowth followed by HT. Other times, I'll use HT for healing when time permits.<br />
<br />
Rejuv is good for dmg mitigation or little bandages. It's definatly not any real heal. It's a &quot;powershield&quot; you may say. And Regrowth is far too mana intensive to be any primary means of healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only gripe about Rest is that there's enough good talents now that I have to fight not to spend more'n 31 points :P<br />
<br />
All the talent recombining they did was a great idea--combining Furor with Intensity, the Faerie Fire talent, the other feral talents.<br />
<br />
Pleased all in all, but I liked Swiftshifting....I tend to do alot of shifting either to get out of trouble(in pvp), or to cover ground etc...we'll see...<br />
<br />
One more person happy about Hurricane btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hertzsae</div><div class="date">09-25-2005, 06:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The changes are awesome.  My observations - <br />
<br />
With Nature's reach moving down, I can't have it allong with Innervate and Feral charge.  I think I may go completely out of balance now, which is fine by me.<br />
<br />
It looks to me like Thick Hide is not limited to only bear form now &quot;Increases your Armor contribution from items by 2%.&quot; vs old &quot;Increases your Armor contribution from items while in Bear Form by 2%.&quot;<br />
<br />
A balance druid that goes 20 points into healing could have 19% mana cost bonus for healing touch by combining Moonglow and Tranquil Spirit.<br />
<br />
Heart of the Wild talent looks awesome.  Almost makes me want to go 0/30/21, even as a primary healer.<br />
<br />
Now that Nature's Focus isn't needed for swiftness, I might not even spec in it at all and just use Barkskin.<br />
<br />
Moonkin form might be as cool as it firsts sounds.  It will still be hard to get casts off with everyone beating on you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LieutenantKettch</div><div class="date">09-25-2005, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should still be able to use barkskin with Moonkin though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking about this as well.  We know there's an expansion coming.  If we presume that the expansion includes a level cap increase (say to lvl 65) then a whole new world of possibilities opens up.  Including a Moonkin / Nature's Swiftness build like this one.<br />

The only thing I hate about this build is losing Furor.  But if I only swap out to buff and patch heal, then it won't matter.  Though, if I am only shifting out of DB to spot heal then I suppose reducing shapeshifting by 20% mana isn't that useful either.<br />
<br />
A last note.  Like many others, I use and enjoy swiftshifting.  I feel that it, more than anything else while exping to 60, has made me a better PvP'er.  Always striving to see exactly how much I could squeeze in to that small space of time.  It really helped as I have always sucked at PvP in the past.  Now though, I can at least survive a long time and keep others up as well.</div></div><hr />

We know there's an expansion coming. If we presume that the expansion includes a level cap increase (say to lvl 65)I'd assume a level cap increase will also come with a talent re-work of some sorts. <br />
<br />
I am curious how this would work if the level does increase. I use to think this game was built perfectly for a level increase with no impact, but now that you mentioned the talent thing, I can actually see problems with it...<br />
<br />
I mean, what if they raised levels to the point you can get Moonkin *and* Leader of the Pact? <br />
What would the latter of the trees look like? <br />
Will they alter the current trees to prevent that?<br />
Would future content actually be hard enough that having both those talents would actually be moot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taithos</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess would be that if they did a level increase they wouldn't give you the ability to add extra Talent points but give an alternate advancement such as the Hero classes. You may find you want to spend more points on the Hero class abilities and actually have less Talent points to spend if they're in the same pool.<br />
<br />
It won't be an issue I don't think.</div></div><hr />

You might be able to get both Moonkin form and NS, but then you couldn't get new_balance_talent_xx that takes 36 points in balance to get instead of 31.<br />

<br />
I'm thinking 38 in balance and 13 in feral now.  I'm certain the 13 in feral regardles of what I do with the rest.  Cat run speed improvement moving down the list is my favorite change.  I can afford it now and still take either other tree to 31.<br />
<br />
I was originally torn between rest and feral, but the new balance tree looks sweet.  Not so good with numbers so I'm not sure if 3% crit chance is really that great.  The armor bonus while casting would be nice tho.<br />
<br />
Anybody with details on Leader of the Pack?  What form does it morph you into?  Is it Dire Cat, Super Dire Bear, or something else entirely?  It's not likely to be a caster form I figure.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong, but this way looks more versital. You can use it while tanking, or while in DPS mode.<br />

Of course if they are terrible in practice then its not a big deal, and if your regular party doesn't really need it then cool. I am just worried that people will say, you don't have innervate, then you must have moonkin etc. If you say I don't have either, then they boot you. Of course then you duel them, and destroy them with the cat/bear depending on the class; then switch to sea cow to laugh at them. Rambling again. All I am saying is, now that the other 31 point talents sound useful, we may be expected to have at least one of them.<br />

What happened? In EQ and EQ2 there were random fluff quests all over the place.

<br />
I will probably play around with moonkin form on test simply because its silly lookin, but I really don't anticipate changing my build.  Looks like moonkin is the anti - BW hunter build.  I doubt you could use it against rogues or warriors without getting killed FAST.  (Unless possibly the damage output from balance tree has been REALLY juiced . . .  no, rogues have stuns, warriors have some kinda casting interrupts, not gonna happen)  Come to that, you can't abolish poison in that form, so its not gonna work against hunters either.  And no other classes melee, so the armor is useless.  Might work against PvE I suppose.  Hard to see it in PvP at all tho.  Then again I could have it all wrong! )<br />
<br />
Have to experiment a bit with the new feral tree, but again, Leader of the Pack is a PvE talent rather than a PvP.  No alliance raid I have ever been in has been organized enough to group a druid with melee damage dealers and keep em together for an assault on a horde stronghold.  The old EQ community would pick up on that and use it in a minute.  My experience is that the WoW community are much less sophisticated players, acting like 30 soloing players rather than a 30 man raid team.<br />
<br />
So, probably I will stick with the 31 resto /  20 balance build that i currently find best for PvP.  The nice thing is that the 20 balance points in the new system will be much more powerful than before, although the resto points will be quite a bit weaker.  Seems at first glance that you cannot improve green maple leaf (I get the names mixed up, sorry) without going more than 31 points into resto.  That heal is for keeping cloth wearers alive in PvE and everyone alive in PvP.  <br />
<br />
My only really sore point about the revamp is having to waste 5 points on speedier casting of green elm leaf just so i can get natures swiftness, which makes it an instant cast anyway.  What were they thinking?</div></div><hr />

Moonkin is appealing, but I can't help but feel I'd get more use out of my mana if I DPS with catform and save it for healing.  Balance tree seems flashy, but after studying it seems as tho it lacks punch.<br />

Heart of the wild just rocks.  If it wasn't for that I wouldn't even spec all the way to Leader of the Pack.<br />

I'm also not sure about the teir one feral talents.  I went with Feral Agression for the +15% bite, even tho its attached to the demoralizing roar junk.   Not sure if I'll miss ferocity to much to keep it that way tho.</div></div><hr />

Dire Bear not only has somewhat limited tools for grabbing aggro, it uses the rage system and has you gain additional health in the form.  Moonkin allows the Druid to safely Nuke.  If we put out an Aura that buffs, what point is it to having it there if we drop as fast as the mages do.  That (to me) looks like the tradeoff.  We don't nuke for as much DPS as a mage/warlock, but we will have more AC as caster specific to keep us alive.  Mages can Ice Block, Warlocks can sacrifice, Druid have more Armor in Moonkin.  Seems fair to me.</div></div><hr />

Only a stupid druid will intentionaly try to grab agro to tank while in Moonkin form. It's all about agro management. So this will allow the druid to survive *in case* they do draw agro, big whoop. A good druid will know to stop all casting of spells and let the tank take the mob off them. A stupid one will thing he/she is a tank and keep nuking (not realizing one thing; they can't heal themselves as a Moonkin!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course mages learn to nuke without drawing aggro, they are fragile (hence the restrictions to cloth).  Also, we are not talking about high armor, but literally potentially the highest armor in the game.  A moonkin will be able to withstand quite a beating and keep casting.  Outside you could always use roots/ grasp to constrain opponent, back off - shift - heal and shift back, and do we know moonkin won't be able to use potions?  A moonkn should be able to draw aggro and take a beating while the higher dps party members take down mobs, the moonkin can aid this effort by lowering armor, applying dot, and slowing with hurricane.  It just seems like there is a great deal of potential for abuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">09-27-2005, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could see where a Druid would assume so.  But I wouldn't see it as abuse.  Like Guice said, in Moonkin we are limited only to Balance spells.  So we would take the beating for a short time before dropping.  Even in Dire Bear, Elite's still hit Druid pretty hard.  Which is why Protection Specc'd Warriors fair much better because we lack the buffed Defense Skill that they do, but yes we do have more armor with the right gear.  Without Frenzied Regeneration or Bash Dire Bear could potentially be overshadowed by Moonkin.  Also I don't think we will be able to pop potions in Moonkin, but I could be wrong heh.  Even if we could it still wouldn't make up.  Bear's have Demoralizing Roar which also helps to mitigate the dmg they we recieve in that form.  Moonkin will only have Fairie Fire, and once we run out of Mana a very pathetic melee attack.  I don't see it working with the way Dire Bear is set up, and will be in the future.</div></div><hr />

No new abilities, just a buff to this or that. That being said, a Moonkin form druid would be great to have for raids, they would survive longer, never as the tank, but just incase of a wipe they might be able to last that extra few hits to rez a preist so that the priest can fade hide and try to come back and rez the rest of the party after battle. As mentioned numerous times in the thread I made about druids vs warriors, druids don't have a lot of aggro tools. In moonkin form they have none I can't really count hoping for high crits on balance spells as a viable way to control aggro. You just can't count on it to happen when needed. I really only see it usefull as  extra damange, never as the main tank. A moonkin as main tank sounds like it would be the OLD Autoattack AFK warriors from previous games.<br />
<br />
As for the talents. You still are putting 6 more points in than before. Granted you gain more bonuses, but are those worth an extra 6 points taken from other trees, further requiring specialization? I don't know. I'm too inexperienced to speak inteligently on the upper tier talents, but as Cenarius mentioned earlier, further specialization can actually weaken the class as a whole and not strengthen it.<br />

<br />
However the changes are somewhat forcing us to specialize even more.  I've always had 11 in balance for OOC and 40 in Restoration.  I can't see having less than 44 in restoration now to be at the same level of healing with a few additional bonus's and really if you are high end then 46 since Tranquility is being reduced to 5 minutes and with Cenarion 2.5; which makes tranquility much more viable.  Looking at the Balance and Feral trees I see similar issues.<br />
<br />
I'll have to see how my guild handles the changes.  Currently we are at a 3 Druid cap for BWL most nights I could see that being raised to 5 with one being balance for mage group and two being feral for rogue or hunter groups.   But we would need to open recruiting a bit more if we made those changes, we have 6 level 60 druids atm in the guild and all of us are kinda stretched between real life and game so maybe 2 or 3 on at raid start time.  If we wanted to have 5 druids on every night we'd need at least 10 in the guild.<br />
<br />
I'll probably stay restoration, but I wouldn't mind going balance if I'm asked to do so.  I don't enjoy melee enough to want to be feral, and positioning will be critical for a aura druid with hunters in group which would mean needing to pay way more attention to melee than I would want to :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know what will happen in the level 60s, but talent wise I would prefer to be a primary healer, if not that then balance would be my next choice. I love the feral talents, but I don't want to focus on them. My ideal build would be enough feral to get charge, enough balance to increase crit MF/SF, and enough restoration for NS and Innervate. Since that isn't possible, I'll have to shave them from Feral.<br />
