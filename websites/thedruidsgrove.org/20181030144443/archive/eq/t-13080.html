Next Patch is roughly set for Jan 18 2006<br />
<br />
<br />
I have turned off the respawn in the first four Widdlethorpe missions.  This will not go live until the next time the zones are patched though.<br />

Although you kill the named spider, you can still fail the mission if the puller doesn't get close enough to get the second update prior to pulling him and killing him. Don't assume the misleading sentence in the mission window updates on the kill, it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Again, the update can be touchy so make sure you &quot;step&quot; on the update spot prior to the pull or clear the room and charge the named to get the update.<br />
<br />
Seems several DoD missions are like this - but this one is really bad cause the missions on this Arc take place underwater which is a pain the butt.</div></div><hr />

There is no respawn but the traps are brutal.  Chain stun and some new AE that took us from 90 mana to 10 mana in seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eiram</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">these traps were threr prior to the patch to, i was hit at last one time but what i heard from guildmates in TS the traps are much more common now and they wander around randomly.<br />
I hope that help a bit i didn't run any of these missions after patch myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorda</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">widdle missions are MORE difficult now..<br />
i've been told only rogues with some aa's can disable the traps..<br />
else traps chain stun (for a LONG time) and do like 3Kdamage/tick.. man!<br />
 <br />
no repops, but sneaking through is quite difficult.<br />
 <br />
Seemed the trap in second room is triggered when more than one player is is room .. pretty much seemed some trap works somewhat differently. They wander or they become inviso. Some can be avoided by hugging the ceiling.<br />
 <br />
Best is NOT moving the group together .. sometimes 1 at a time doesnt trigger trap. Always keep at least one healer at range so that he can still heal while others are stun and getting hurt badly.</div></div><hr />
