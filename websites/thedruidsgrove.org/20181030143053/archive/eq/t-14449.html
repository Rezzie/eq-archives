<br />
So far (Today) have posted about:<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
Skin to Vines (New context menu, adding a cast on other message)<br />
Icefall Breath (No AC debuff, questioned if this was on purpose)<br />
<br />
AA:<br />
<br />
Spirit of the White Wolf overwriting Seasons, asked for the cold resist to be moved to a differant slot and allow stacking.<br />
<br />
Any other issues relating to our spells?  Not asking about spell cuts.  But on the spells we got working properly.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The druid aura doesn't stack with the shaman spell Preternatural Foresight. They both have an unknown in slot 2, but I am pretty sure those unknowns are not the same. Preternatural is the new sense.</div></div><hr />

Went from root breaking on nukes maybe 15 percent of the time, to only holding maybe 10 percent of the time, right after I bought it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fixed invis: if mine is up, and someone casts theirs, all break.  <br />
    &quot;You appear.&quot;<br />
    &quot;Your body fades away.&quot;<br />
    &quot;You return to view.&quot;<br />
Likewise when I tried to use my (spell) invis on someone else who had another invis up.<br />
<br />
Exodus...let's just say I killed quite a few folks this weekend, regardless what percentage they were at when I hit it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's Mammoth Strength, Aura of Life was causing Preternatural Foresight to drop.</div></div><hr />

I told our shammys to quit buffing with it cause one of my warriors is a tyrant about keeping auras up and I don't want to catch a beating. :)<br />
 <br />
Also noticed that I can cast superior camo, or any other invis, and then cast invis on someone else, or recast my personal invis and Invis does not break.  Unless it's a bug, it means never having to worry about finding a safe spot to refresh invis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When casting Skin to Vines and it holds, upon it wearing off you are unable to reapply it. You get the &quot;does not meet spell requirements&quot; message everytime. I guess at the moment once you alter your target to a plant it retains this even when the spell wears off. If the spell has worn off though you would assume they are not longer a plant and need it recast.</div></div><hr />

does the fire portion of winters flame get affected by the dawnstrike proc?  didn't see any big (3-4kish) hits off it last night alternating the two.  i know dawnstrike proced at least 15-20 times durring my xp session, most hits were still in the 1.9-2.1k range for the fire portion.<br />
<br />
was debuffing both fire and cold.<br />
<br />
so i guess what i'm asking is:  does the dawnstrike proc have a level cap on what it affects?</div></div><hr />

The most it will increase Winter's Flame Fire Portion is thus, 70% with an average increase of 35%.</div></div><hr />
