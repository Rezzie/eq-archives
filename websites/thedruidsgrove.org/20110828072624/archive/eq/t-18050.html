Basically I am a casual player and I have made it solo to 61, if I want to get to 70 and I want at least the good DD spells.......do I need groups or can I do it through buying items in the bazaar and having them researched?</div></div><hr />

I'd recommend against it.  However, you should have no trouble finding someone willing to do research combines at cost if you provide the dropped part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">04-16-2009, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get the dropped part, can a level 61 or Level 65 Druid solo the zone to get the drops? What zones drop it and is it from common or named?<br />
Bascially, can a Druid solo his way to 70, get the drops needed for spells again all solo, or are groups a must?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-17-2009, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the dropped parts are &quot;global&quot; drops from any NPC of an appropriate level; it's not something I've paid much attention to, though, so hopefully someone can confirm it.</div></div><hr />

I was used to lower levels where you had access to 99% of your spells. But to get form 61 to 70, can it be done with access to only 50% of your spells, using Wildfire as your only DD?</div></div><hr />
