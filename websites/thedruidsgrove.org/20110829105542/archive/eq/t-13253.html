I don't know much about augments but I have seen alot for sale in the bazaar. Could anyone give me suggestions of what augments to get based off of the equipment I have? <br />

<br />
There are many really great augs available from the merchants associated with DoN (in the lavastorm cave).  And they wind up being a fairly good deal, considering the time it takes to earn the crystals that they cost.  There are FT1/2/3 augs, most all the base foci, armor, jewellery, and augs that add stats/resists/hp/mana.  Also weapon augs to add procs and such.<br />
<br />
My plan is to fill out most of my augs with DoN items, with the exception of a tradeskill aug &quot;of Pure Potency&quot;.  It has Affliction Efficiency 5, and is the only droppable item in the game that has this focus (for Druids at least).  That will set you back at least 200K though, at least on my server.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

 <br />
RSS has some nice mana augs for ring/ear slots.  DoN has good resist/mana augs as well as focus effects you might want/need.  Several DoD missions provide an aug as the reward that can add some useful stats if you have the slots for it.</div></div><hr />

Also has 65hp OR 65 mana augs for shoulders, belt, back, and neck. My advice would be to not get DoN augs for those slots....unless you have an abundance of crystals.</div></div><hr />
