<br />
But for some reason, when i attempt to log in to the forums, all i get is the Login Failure error message. I have never posted on the forums before, or even attempted to log in, so it cant be a forum ban for whatever reason. This has been the case for over a month, ever since i first got the game and made an account.<br />
<br />
Anyone else ever experience this, and if so, know of a solution? Thanks in advance. :smile:</div></div><hr />

Tried on another computer and I could log in fine.  If you can't seem to log in from different computers, then it might be something you have to contact Blizzard about.  If you can log in on someone else's computer, then you might have a cache problem.  If you use IE clear out your cache or download Firefox and try a separate browser completely.  If you use Firefox, try clearing out the FF cache or try IE.</div></div><hr />

Maybe forums fall into that category?</div></div><hr />

Either they just got lucky and for somereason didn't get kicked or were able to login, or my it may have been my computer for the 1 day I couldn't login.</div></div><hr />
