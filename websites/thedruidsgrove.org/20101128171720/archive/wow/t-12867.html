<br />
I made a new druid !  This time going to be a leaf druid :&gt;  She is just little level 14 at the moment, her name is Softest.<br />
<br />
If you made another druid, what sort of druid would it be and what name would you choose? :&gt;<br />

<br />
Allahanastar -&gt; Very elvish name<br />
Starmourn -&gt; because he weeps for nature's dying... (BOOMKIN)<br />
and Starmourn -&gt; Because I really like the name for my Tauren too....</div></div><hr />

<br />
As tanking is the one thing I've never really done in WoW I guess I'd have to go full on bear form.<br />
<br />
As for names, Daisy? Ermentrude?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, if I had to roll another Druid, I think I'd choose Boomkin.  <br />
<br />
In the past, when I've respecced to farm, I've chosen Balance.  And even in Resto gear, I was a force.  So, I can only imagine the power I'd have as a Balance Druid actually wearing Balance gear.</div></div><hr />

Turalyon (Active)<br />

Lorne - 45 Tauren Resto<br />
Illhorn - 43 Tauren Feral<br />
Hellene - 15 Tauren Feral<br />

Next February, I'm hoping to get the 'Elder' title from the Lunar Festival quest chain for Berrywine... :thumbsup: <br />
Doubly appropriate since my guild is 'The Elders of Turalyon'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What name would you give to the boomkin?<br />
<br />
&quot;Root&quot; is my favourite name out of the suggestions so far :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had:<br />
<br />
Setah - my main, 70, feral, NE female<br />
Aedrion - 45ish, Boomkin, NE male<br />
Kearsa - 20ish, Feral, tauren female<br />
<br />
Setah and Aedrion (well, it's suposed to be spelled Aedrian, but that was taken xD) are names from other games I've used and kinda associate personalities with... most of my names are similar, it's a system I've used for years.   Setah's generally a hybrid attacker/support type of character, either male or female doesn't matter, and generally follows a quiet-yet-strong-when-need-be personality.  Aedrian's generally a hybrid healer/attacker, USUALLY female (go figure), and can be kinda an oddball. <br />
<br />
Kearsa's just a name I came up with once but really like, to me it seems very animal-like, which is why I thought it'd work great for a tauren feral.</div></div><hr />
