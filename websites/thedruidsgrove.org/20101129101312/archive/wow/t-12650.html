Seems kind of backwards to me, shamans are fantastic on raid damage, we're good, but not as good as shamans.  But then when we're doing Morogrim Tidewalker I know they're barely keeping the MT up.  It's nuts that they have me doing the watery graves when I could be flattening out that spikey damage on the MT, especially when one of his healers is watery graved.  But someone once read that the WG healer should be a druid and that seemed to stick in their minds and they won't consider using another class.  (Maybe I should skip that raid one night so they're forced to use another class...)</div></div><hr />

I'm probably the best geared healer in the guild now so it isn't that.  I think part of it is that the RHL might not really understand what druids do and how we can work.  <br />
<br />
 I hate to kick up a fuss because it is such a thankless job, to be a raid healing lead.  And I don't mind, I'd just do it differently, if it were me.  I also do a lot more healing than I'm usually assigned to.    <br />
<br />
Do other guilds only use resto druids on WG?  That seems odd to me too.  I kind of think they use me just because it is easier than training someone new to do it. :p  I guess I could tell them to put the murloc tanks near me and I can keep them healed too.</div></div><hr />

And yeah sometimes I also get assigned to heal the raid. We tend to take a lot of priest healers with us, and maybe one pally or shaman. We don't do Moro that often but I had no problems keeping the victims up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Putting Shaman on the MT makes sense since their chain heals would also be hitting the melee, but there should be more than just the couple of Shaman on the MT.<br />
<br />
We generally raid with 1 Druid, 1 Shaman, 2 Palys and 3 Priests.  Druid on MT + Raid, Shaman Raid, 1 Paly on WT'd players (helping on the Murlock tank also) 1 Paly on the Murlock tank.  Priests on the MT.<br />
<br />
I can easily keep LB/Rejuv on the MT and heal the casters up.<br />
<br />
But... whatever works for the raid... well, it works.  If it doesn't work, then ask him to try some new things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always run with resto druids on MT on Morogrim. The steady healing with lack of bursts make them perfect for healing after earthquake. We always had a priest on watery graves. <br />
<br />
As (apparently not every guild, but) almost every guild we have paladins on MT:s, Shamans on raid healing, Druids and Priests on both (depending on fight).</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 25-mans, I'm on a Tank unless we are pugging a healer (casual Guild - we usually have to) and the PuG healer is better geared than I am (which is, to say, most times :rolleyes:).  Then I get raid healing.  <br />
<br />
TBH, I am quite content with raid healing.  Rather like it, in fact.  Not nearly as stressful as Tank healing.  And less stress = more fun.<br />
<br />
However, I make it a point to never be too far away from my &quot;usual&quot; tank assignment.  Better geared healer or not, my tank's not dying on my watch.  ;)</div></div><hr />
