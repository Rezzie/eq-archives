I'm at lvl 46, and have &quot;talked&quot; with Doctor Gustaf VanHowzen in Theramore several times...no &quot;Triage&quot; quest. Has this changed since the powerleveling guides came out? Thanks for all the help...maybe I'm just missing something easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First thing I thought of was level requirement. You have to be level +35 to qualify. According to the link in your sig, you're level 46, so that shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Have you checked the official bug forums? Crap like this happens every patch. If I were you I'd open a ticket and see what a GM has to say.</div></div><hr />

Same thing Horde side.<br />

Expert first aid, or one of the bandage types, I don't recall for sure, been a long time since my main(s) did it, and my alts aren't quite there yet.</div></div><hr />

You have to complete a quest  (bandage wounded NPCs) to get the next level.<br />
<br />
Here's the details...<br />

If you have failed the quest (it is on a timer I think), you might have to abandon it and retry it.  I know I had to do the quest a few times before I earned Artisan level.  The key is to turn on NPC tags (Ctrl-V???).  And bandage those with the shortest bar first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrah</div><div class="date">02-20-2008, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, indeed...it does suck. I wonder if I need to get the Mageweave bandage book first? I haven't done it because the Heavy Silk are just fine. I think I'll look for that book (or snag off the AH) and try it again. If still nothing, I'll open a ticket. Thanks for the help!</div></div><hr />

You can't have 225 skill in First Aid without buying the Mageweave book. I guess I'm wrong for having assumed you actually went to wowwiki and searched &quot;first aid.&quot;<br />
