<br />
I've used it for a long time but it hasn't been updated in ages and now doesn't work at all in 2.0.1.<br />
<br />
I liked it mainly because it gave me macros to replace my spells which when used would selfcast if I had a enemy or nothing targeted or would cast normally if I had a friendly selected. <br />
<br />
I know I can alt+hotkey for selfcast but just hitting a number and having it react smartly is VERY nice.<br />
<br />
It worked for all 3 types of heal, remove poison, and remove curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">12-07-2006, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a key binding to turn on and off auto self-cast, which does not require a hotkey to self-heal. I bound that to my &quot;`&quot; key, so whenever I PvP or solo, I turn it on. When I'm in a group/raid, I turn it off.<br />
<br />
If you're planning on having it on all the time, you don't need to bind it. You can go to your interface options screen (forgot if it's in basic or advanced), and check the Auto Self Cast option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/cast [help] Rejuvenation; [target=player] Rejuvenation<br />
<br />
If the target is friendly cast Rejuvenation else selfcast. Replace &quot;Rejuvenation&quot; with the name of whatever spell, buff, decurse, or depoison you like.</div></div><hr />

There's an &quot;Auto SelfCast&quot; option in the interface options menu which does exactly what I was looking for ;)</div></div><hr />
