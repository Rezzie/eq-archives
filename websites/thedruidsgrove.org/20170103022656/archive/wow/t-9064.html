<br />
Anyway, yea. You don't need to bug people to be able to reset instances, all you have to do is use a simple macro (case sensitive): <br />
<br />
/invite personsname <br />
/script LeaveParty() <br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the deal. You DO need a second person, but they don't have to know about it. You just have to find someone who's in a group already (pro tip: /who stratholme or /who blackrock spire etc etc). <br />
<br />
Once you've got your person add them into the macro. <br />
<br />
Now here's the steps: <br />
<br />
-Go into your instance of choice, and farm whatever you're after <br />
-Once you've got everything, just stop. Don't go back to the entrance, stay where you are. <br />
-Use the macro. <br />
-You will see the following: <br />
<br />
You leave the group. <br />
You have invited Person to your group. <br />
<br />
then a few seconds later the little box will popup saying &quot;you are not in this instance's group. you will be ported to xxxx in 60 seconds&quot; <br />
<br />
Once the box pops up, log off. <br />
<br />
Now, log back in. <br />
<br />
Guess where you are? Right back at the entrance of the instance. But it's a fresh, NEW instance, and you're ready to continue farming. <br />
<br />
Rinse, repeat. <br />
<br />
Possible problems: <br />
<br />
If you use the macro and it says &quot;Person is already in a group&quot;, it didn't work. Press the macro again. Problem solved. It just shouldn't ever actually say they're in a group. Just what I posted above. <br />
<br />
If the person leaves their group, they're gonna start getting invites from you, most likely pissing them off. So try to find someone who just started a long instance (scholololo) and milk them for every minute. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, it works perfectly.</div></div><hr />

Contradictory statements. Or is it relying on a bug within WoW for this to work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">07-11-2005, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not contradictory, because in WoW macros everything happens simultaneously.  It's less a bug, and more just the way things are in the game.  It's why 2 rogues can Gouge each other and both be stunned/disoriented (at least this is true in PvE).<br />
<br />
If you get the &quot;already in group&quot; message, it means there is something wrong with your macro or that somehow the whole macro didn't get transmitted and received by the server properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, running past the mobs in LBRS and jumping onto that ledge above the lava and ALT-F4 ing to get out of combat - that's a sploit since people use it to bypass mobs.  I heard a rumor Blizz was gonna do something to prevent this (by having alt-f4 not log you out or something), but honestly with all the instance-related bugs and wow.exe crashes, I don't see how they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-11-2005, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Blizzard doesn't &quot;allow&quot; you, nor do they stop you. They don't condone farming by any stretch, but they aren't intetionally trying to stop you (at this time)  in this instance.<br />
<br />
2) You're using connectivity lag to your advangage. In a true no lag situation, this would be impossible as the return error would be instant.<br />
<br />
You are using an exploit. Instances are set at 30 minute cooldown/respawn time for a reason. What you're doing is exploiting connectivity lag, and another player, to reset your instance instantly aka creating a new instance.</div></div><hr />

In the cases where farming was rampant (Rogues and SM - Doan, Mages and DM: East) adjustments were made in sale prices and loot tables.  If Blizz wanted to forbid players resetting instances, they would simply lock you to an instance for a set period of time, as they do with MC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my real personality. This isn't any &quot;self righteous &quot; act. Some of us do like to play by the rules. Blizzard put in a 30 minute cooldown/respawn time on instances which very clearly shows you and everybody else that Blizzard did not intend for these instances to be ran more than once, per group, every 30minutes.<br />
<br />
Whether you like it or not, running a &quot;hack&quot; like this is circumventing the way they initially built the system.<br />

If Blizz wanted to forbid players resetting instances, they would simply lock you to an instance for a set period of time, as they do with MC.Small problem; MC locks you out completely. Obviously it wouldn't be in the game's best interest to lock out any player from any dugeon for 30 minutes. What if you wanted to help your buddy? I bet this is a key reason why they've been lax on locking down this exploit.<br />
<br />
Like I said just above; whether you like it or not, this &quot;hack&quot; circumvents how instances were initially designed. I mean, come on man; you gotta do a bloody &quot;hack&quot; *just right* just to get your instance reset. Doesn't that seem too much for something that Blizzard &quot;allows by designed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I stand corrected in Blizzard's allowance of resetting instances. I always thought resetting them prior to the allotted 30 minutes felt like an exploit. Guess I'm mistaken.<br />
<br />
Okay; If Blizzard allows resetting of them, why don't they provide an option somehow like CoH does? Probably not that feasable within their UI.</div></div><hr />

/invite person<br />
/script LeaveParty()<br />
/logout<br />
<br />
this macro is so you dont have to exit instance to keep restarting, as soon as your done with w/e u need just bust this macro, it iwll log you out, when u log back in u'll be @ begining of new instance.</div></div><hr />

Essentially all you're doing is saving yourself the time from having to run out of the instance and back in again.  It's not really an exploit IMO, just a time saver like any other macro.</div></div><hr />

now you have to invite someone, promote him to leader and leave the grp. that will do the same. theres also an addon on curse gaming &quot;ResetPanda&quot;, it does all the things ive mentioned automatically. so all you have to do is make a friend download an addon which automatically accepts grp invites (dunno any, but it should exist) while you use resetpanda, and youll be able to reset instances within a few seconds again =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resetting instances is sanctioned by Blizzard (Eyonix or Fangtooth themselves posted how to do it).  There were some other game issues, I believe, related to the script that caused it to be removed/modified.  This might have been related to raidinfo/raid id issues, and/or instance splitting.</div></div><hr />

During this Tuesdayfs weekly maintenance, we will be implementing code into the game that will limit the amount of unique instances a player can enter. This new code should relieve the realm wide instance instability issues for legitimate players that were caused by players trying to exploit the instances.<br />

Link is bad.<br />

Believe what you want.  What Blizz is doing is preventing people who were exploit farming in DM (mostly west).<br />
<br />
I fully believe normal 5 man speed runs (about 10-15 min a shot in west) will still be possible.  What won't be possible is the &quot;zone in, look for easy tome, not there, zone out and reset&quot; crap.</div></div><hr />

I read it's something like 5 per hour. So if you're in the instances for less than 12 minutes, then you'll have to worry.<br />
<br />
Most runs can at least 30 minutes which will make no problem for lagit players.<br />
<br />
I've always seen it as a means of exploitation, personally, but eh so be it. I'm just not a fan of resetting for farming purposes (I dispise farming--brought over from my forced farming days in EQ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">08-22-2005, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, Blizzard has confirmed that it's 5 resets per hour.<br />
Many of you have questions about how the new system works and why it was implemented. The new system works like this: a player can enter up to 5 unique instances per hour. If that player tries to enter a 6th instance less than an hour after they entered the first, they will be blocked from doing so. Players must wait one hour from the time they enter the first instance before they can enter any others. This does not apply to battleground instances, nor do battleground instances count towards a player's total. The same goes for the Tram and officers' barracks (which aren't instances).</div></div><hr />

It was also done to slow down the flow of Dark Iron Ore that was entering the world.</div></div><hr />
