<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>caylinwest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild almost has enough keys to do Sleeper's Tomb now.   Since I have never fought in the zone before, I was wondering if druids had any &quot;particular&quot; job in ST or is it just like any other raiding situation.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Edit:  just noticed the section I put this post.  Could a Mod please put it in the strat section.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same job as anywhere.  Heal, nuke, die.  Frankly, my guild doesn't award keys to druids.  Yeah, yeah ... It sucks.  The guild does offer robo toons if a fella *really* wants to see inside the place.  But druids won't get ST loot cause of melee priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are some nice druid usable items in st. FT shield, sightless velium eye, a ranged resist type item (can't recall name but my monk has one) plus the quested <br />

The effect is pretty lame and doesn't stack with much but that stats are nice for something that is pre-luclin/pop.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we only have 2 druids keyed for st, but they come in handy. On the other hand, it is waste key up a lot of casters when you are really only going there for primal. <br />
<br />
your roll in st will be just like anywhere else - regen is a big bonus when doing warders. Healing, nuking and casting PoS. Beyond that...st is pretty boring ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ro's debuffs are nice, fire nukes work, and patch heals can help as well.  I wouldn't say it is much different from any other zone.  With HoR, Illumination, Immolation of Ro and a few crits, I got to tank the Progenitor for a while last night  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've never farmed ST.  I'd suspect you have the standard raid roles.  Buff, Heal, Nuke<br />
<br />
In the event of a total wipe, you will be dragging a cleric/necro/rogue back to do the corpse recovery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kendali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">mobs in there hit like pansies compared to PoP mobs hehe, so yeah druids can be main healers, assist healers, or just nukers...<br />
<br />
personally my guild/alliance has sorta been leisurely entering ST lately and i finally got my key, apparently we needed more priests of any type in there hehe....just so all our melees who are keyed could get some primal when prog and motg were up (had problems with not enough clerics/priests logged in to get something together for a while there, after all we're a family-oriented alliance that raids some big things sometimes but no required attendance) usually i track prog up and me and a cleric or two can take a couple groups of melees in and get them some primals....easy kills and druids can contribute as much as a cleric can<br />

I can't believe a Guild wouldn't want to add Druid power to a ST Raid.  ?????  /boogle<br />
<br />
Think about a nicely-AA'ed 65 Druid and what they can do for an ST Raid:<br />
<br />
-- CH heals for 4600<br />
-- Patch heals for 1750 + AA + possible Crits<br />
-- Keep other grp members alive so Cleric 100% on MT/ST<br />
-- SoTW<br />
-- Debuff, debuff and debuff some more<br />
-- Wrath of Wild DS<br />
-- Radiant Cure<br />
-- HP Regen<br />
-- Nuke, or DoT<br />
-- Stun gating mobs<br />
-- Buffs (Tell me the Wiz/Mage/Shammy dont like Bot9)<br />
<br />
My Guild has --just-- begun farming ST, for like the last 4 weeks is all, and let me tell you, we Druids are a welcome asset to the Raid.  In fact, I think we got like 5 keyed Clerics and 4 keyed Druids.......  And my Guild has only gotten about 30 keys so far.<br />
<br />
Any Guild that doesnt respect what a good Druid has to offer is either just silly or dumb in my opinion<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
First time we went, we downed 2 Warders, wiped to the 3rd and called it good enough. AE Acid Jet thingy tore us up!<br />
<br />
Second time we got there and only 2 were up so we took out 1 and called it good.<br />
<br />
3rd time we finally got our Bard to get his arse online and **HOLY CRAP** what a diffrence that made for the Warder fights.  Bard's resist songs = UBBER help.  Downed all 3 warders with like 4 deaths total!  :) <br />
<br />
My Guild has scored like 20+ Primals now!  No SoD's yet......<br />
<br />
Just standing there, looking at The Sleeper was one of the very best days in my EQ life.<br />
