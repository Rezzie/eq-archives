<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok.  I have all of the VT key except the rift, which a friend told me he can get for me once its the last piece, and shards from ssra, the grey, and seru.<br />
<br />
However, I also need the emp key.<br />
<br />
What's a MINIMAL force to kill the named for the ring? Assuming that the named is up for the particular camp. <br />
<br />
I can duo Warden Mekuzh with a bard, and I hear he drops the pouch, but beyond that I know nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WyteNK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I'm looking for info on a quest, I usually go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;allakhazam&lt;/a&gt;, since I'll get the answer right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>L1ndara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I duoed the 2nd floor captain with a monk back in Luclin, he'd be soloable now by top druids.  The 1st floor captain is no harder than the 2nd floor one.  The named around the portal are pretty easy, 1 group tops, it's actually harder getting to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aidon Rufflefuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The hardest part will be the piece from the 3rd floor, You might need a full group to kill a General.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Comm 1 -  min group would be any melee + your druid (my monk tanked without slow)<br />
<br />
Comm 2 -  Basically a shm + any melee can duo here. Slow makes it simple, but without slow you should prob have a tank that is ranger or better. My monk did tank him and the elite ph's more than a few times though.<br />
<br />
It goes a lot faster though with a high dps group and constant pulls.<br />
<br />
For the pouch, you kill the taskmasters which can't be slowed (if I remember right). They can't be snared or rooted either. So, your best bet is a plate tank. Some tm's are harder than others...the flurry one for example requires pretty much constant healing. Some rampage which means you'll want a tank + another melee to get the rampage dmg so you can heal safely.<br />
<br />
For the insignia you'll need a really good group or more (recommend atleast 2). They have a stupid amount of hps and even worse ac. You also need a rogue to get you through the door. Luckily the rares drop the insignia everytime and they're more common than the commanders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the advice, guess I'll need to get a real tank and maybe a slower to come with me.  Any other tips about the fights would also be appreciated.<br />
<br />
WyteNK, if you'd bothered to read, I know HOW to do the quest just fine, and allakhazam sucks for info like how many people it takes... just go look at the link for General Kizuhx, you have one guy say it took 50 people 20 minutes to kill him, and another guy say they killed him in 2 minutes with 30 people.  THE INFO SUCKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bear in mind that while he can be killed by a tank and you, the challenge will be actually getting him pulled and dealing wiht any adds.  You would of course only be working a small camp with a trio or so, but be aware that many of the pull spots are hard to get without a FD splitter of some kind.<br />
<br />
Commanders are unslowable, so you do need to do more healing on your tank for them.  I know people who duoed him (and a few who soloed) but I would recommend at least 3 just because while the tricks are fun, his spawn is really rare and you need to do a lot of killing to get him.<br />
<br />
Taskmasters are mostly slowable (2 are not).  I have seen a shaman solo them...easy to get duo with a shaman.  Probably soloable by a superhero druid but again, unless you are trying to prove something, why bother making it that hard on yourself.<br />
<br />
Third floor is probably doable with a group, but honestly I have never known anyone to do it with less than 2, and normally you go as a raid.  I have seen 3rd floor mobs pulled to 1st floor Ass room, but honestly there is a clean corner you can do the camp in so little reason to do special effect pulls.  The 3rd floor mobs have beeelions of HP, and at least one of them has a neato 300yard gflux it does repeatedly during the fight.  If you are in a guild working on emp best thing to do is:<br />
<br />
* If no one has the piece, call a raid for 3rd floor and go and get 50 or 60 in a few hours.  The nameds spawn regularly and you can grind through a lot in a few hours.<br />
<br />
* If everyone has one, just have your raid stop on the way to emp and kill a few until you get a named for those for whom it is the last piece.<br />
<br />
If you don't have key and are looking at this as an investment in a future guild decision you lose nothing by waiting.  Any emp killing guild will stop to help someone get their missing piece if it is the last one....3rd floors are easy to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did all parts except the third floor with  a shaman and a monk.  I got very lucky on Comm2, as it was up when I zoned in.  The first floor took forever.  The other I got waiting for people to get to an emp raid.  Voila.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But Alla's is right!  It CAN take some folks 50 people and 20 minutes to kill a mob it takes other folks two groups and a few minutes to kill.<br />
<br />
Lots of folks are 65 now.  If you're time equipped, and so are your pals, you can probably duo/trio almost anything for the ring, and do a single group for the third floor easily.  (But why would you want to?  If you're time equipped, VT gear shouldn't be droolworthy.)<br />
<br />
The folks who seem to need VT for equipment, I'd say, a group for basement, first, second floor should make things fairly fast and relaxed.<br />
<br />
For the third floor, I'd suggest two groups, three for faster killing.<br />
<br />
For folks who are more elemental/time equipped, well, they could probably do it with far fewer, but why would they want to??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Customary and quickest to do<br />
<br />
Comm1 - Single group<br />
Comm2 - Single group<br />
Taskmasters - Single group +<br />
Insignia/General - On the way to emp with the raid as you wait for late comers.<br />
<br />
Sure you can do it with less, but I prefer to have a chanter, and monk/shadowknight in my group for this.  You can clear more spots and get it to spawn faster.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Allmine Notyours</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Commanders 1 and 2 ARE both slowable.  I slowed the first floor one tonight with my BST and have slowed the second floor one in the past.  <br />
<br />
Every mob except the 3rd floor named are easily one group or less.  As long as you take your time and make sure you get reasonable pulls, 2 max.<br />
<br />
The Elites that pop in tube rooms as PH for the Commanders are in fact UNSLOWABLE<br />
<br />
If anybody has any questions about these camps drop me a tell on the 7th hammer.  I am currently living in this zone with my guild prepping for an emp kill :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maybe it is the ph's that are not slowable on C2 camp?<br />
<br />
Something up there isn't....and the more I htink on it the more it might just be the senior guards or whatever.<br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
Sorry for the error.  It has been a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yrys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For the commander camps, everything is slowable except the elites on the 2nd floor (comm 2 camp).  First floor elites (comm 1 camp) are slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MrBonk37</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i would bring a plate tank, yourself, a cleric, and a ton of dps. with just 2 people it will take forever to clear the ph's therefor making the spawn take forever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thats why we wouldn't kill PHs, just gank the named if they're up.</div></div><hr />
