Can someone show me what it is supposed to look like in the macro screen.. Thanks</div></div><hr />

If you're in a raid situation (IE, you can attack something from behind) you're going to want to do something like this:<br />
mangle to keep the debuff<br />
shred to 4-5 combo points<br />
wait for 70 energy<br />
rip<br />
mangle<br />
<br />
Because you'll get combo points when you crit, you can't do this as a castsequence; sometimes you'll need to throw in an extra mangle, sometimes you can do an extra shred. <br />
<br />
If you can't be behind your mob, chances are your sequence looks like this:<br />
<br />
mangle<br />
<br />
Seriously - mangle is the best move by far for doing damage. Finishing with a ferocious bite is sometimes okay, sometimes  ripping a mob that'll take a while to kill is okay, but in general mangle outdamages every other option you have. The only reason to do anything else is because you want to avoid damage; if you want that, you'll want a pounce-&gt;mangle-&gt;mangle-&gt;maim-&gt;shred, and you don't want that as a castsequence either.<br />
<br />
Really, cat dps is dynamic enough that you don't want to use a generic sequence. You want to think about what you're doing and do the right thing at the right time, and that's going to change depending. But most of the time, the right thing is simply to mash mangle.</div></div><hr />

I do have one macro I use that does my prowl (if out of combat), pounce (if stealthed) and shred (if in combat).  Otherwise I keep Mangle, Rip and Bite on nearby keys.  I also have a few mini-macros that are all &quot;/startattack... mangle&quot; or &quot;/startattack....FFF&quot; so when I switch mobs and don't have energy I will at least start attacking with white damage.  I do the same with bear mangle, swipe, FFF and lacerate.<br />
<br />
For questing you don't need to wait for 70 energy before you rip.  Do it a 4 cp as soon as you have the energy.  The &quot;Waiting until you have 70energy&quot; is for group PvE.</div></div><hr />

Most mobs that's not an issue, and it's better to either just mangle again or FB.This is true if you are lvl 70 and have 2K+ AP and 30%+ crit, but at say lvl 45 I found Rip at 4 cp a better way to go.  Most of the time a mob would have 40-60% health when you reach 4 cp, that is plenty of health (IMO) to waste a rip on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalbear</div><div class="date">05-07-2008, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And that's my point - if you can get more than 4 ticks of a rip off, go ahead and rip. Otherwise, it's better to mangle, FB (if the FB will finish the mob) or maim/shred. If you don't have mangle, rip is likely going to be better anyway. If you do, it's manglespam time.<br />
<br />
As a rule of thumb I rip if the mob is at 50% and I have 4+cp. This happens against high-armor mobs quite a bit (the Myrmidons on IQD come to mind here). You still shouldn't have a macro that does a specific cast sequence though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">05-08-2008, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I find doing a rip at 1 cp usually means I don't have to do a FB at the end. I always hate doing a FB and having a mob have a lot of hp left or getting to 4cp an realizing it will get at most 2 ticks before the mob dies. I found this true at lvl 40 and at lvl 70 - though I will say I don't have any real raid drop/badge dps gear. This also depends if the mob type has a lot of hp or armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">05-08-2008, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually use Rip quite a bit during rep grinding sessions.  I load a mob up to 4 cp and then I rip and then start on the next mob.  90% of the time the mob I started on dies to the rip and I'm already ready for another mob.  I can juggle 3-4 mobs at once just by doing 4cp, rip and then on to the next one.  However note.... I'm in most of T4, I have the new Staff of the Forest Lord and several T5 level drops.  So my DPS kitty set is nicely kitted out.  So chain killing 10-15 mobs before stopping to heal myself is not unusual.  The heals I get from my crits usually keep me close to topped off until I'm juggling 3-4 mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The macro command you are looking for is /castsequence<br />
<br />
I've never used castsequences as it feels a bit like automating my play, and I prefer the control of having single abilities bound to buttons.<br />
<br />
If you want to go ahead and make the macro anyway, the best place to learn is probably http://www.wowwiki.com/HOWTO:_Make_a_Macro#Sequencing_spells_and_items<br />
