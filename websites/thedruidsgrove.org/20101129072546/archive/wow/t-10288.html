<br />
If it wasn't for 2 of his other buddies (mage &amp; pally - good ol' fashioned alliance combo) using me for target practice he'd have eaten bear paw...<br />
<br />
Anyway, when did they start having this ability? Anyone tell me more about it? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

We have a hunter in the guild that has it, and once in a while he transforms when using ranged attacks. Pretty funny stuff. :]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">03-22-2006, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a proc from an item set - Thekal's and Arlokk's Grasps from ZG.  It's something like 2-3% chance on atk to transform into Tony the Tiger (phase 2 Thekal).  Buff is +300 atk power.<br />
<br />
Since it requires both weapons, most people acquiring this set are Hunters - the proc works off of ranged attacks as well.  Neither Fist weapon (they are pimp looking claws) is all that great as far as stats go.  More of a vanity set than anything.<br />
<br />
That said, my hunter has Arlokk's and is waiting for the next Thekal drop.<br />

The proc is a lot of fun, but very infrequent.  Seems to be set as a proc once per 5 minutes, roughly.  Considering the lack of stats on the Offhand, I was hoping for more frequent procs.<br />

<br />
I notice no difference in proc frequency whether meleeing (Annhilators/Surgers in MC, Anubiseths in AQ20, etc.) or ranged.  Do let me know if you see it a lot more than once/5 minutes tho.</div></div><hr />
