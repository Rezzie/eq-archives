My question is, what types of things can I do to raise my dmg output so that in the 1v1 or 1v2 mob fights I can dps them down before survivability becomes an issue?<br />
<br />
I plan on buying up some gear off the AH with my 70 alt, going to look for str/agi type gear, any particular gear sets you guys know of would be usefull to know as well, and much appreciated.  Been looking through the guides and i will feel completely blind if i've missed something along these lines.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to our Druid's Grove ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the early itemization for feral druids is a bit weak.  The stats you will want to go for are strength, followed closely by agility.  This will remain the case until about level 62 when you get your first weapon with +feral AP.<br />
<br />
Now that you are level 20 and have cat form, you have the opportunity to grind mobs and level up very quickly.  Anything you can do to increase your strength and agility will have a positive effect on your damage.<br />
<br />
Buying armor from the AH is one option, although quite expensive.  If you're feeling flush you might even be better off buying some cheap elixirs or buff food.<br />
<br />
As you level more, you may also want to consider stamina as another stat to go for.  This will enable you to tank, if the need arises.  I would suggest getting some early practice tanking before you enter Outlands at level 58.  This will mean you are more comfortable with the role of tank when it is inevitably asked of you in the later stages of levelling.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have any more specific questions please let us know, I am sure we will try to halp as best we can :&gt;  Let us know how you get on!<br />

Once you obtain your Pounce ability your survival rate will increase greatly.  :thumbsup:   I can routinely survive 1v2 (and 1v3 with a well planed, shift-heal-shift) fights on my feral druid.</div></div><hr />

Honestly cant wait to start tanking with a druid, is gonna be pretty interesting to see how druid tanking is different from tanking on my Pally(who has been my main for the last year and a half).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-08-2008, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well certain tanking skills should be transferrable, such as hiding behind corners to Line-Of-Sight ranged mobs towards you.  The mechanics of druid tanking differ greatly though - for a start you have rage instead of mana.  :&gt;<br />
