<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OK now I have a rough idea how these work but I have a few question as I have yet to see a single charm around.<br />
<br />
Are these the full stats on the charms, or what they were to you at the time of inspecting?<br />
<br />
Does a charm tell you what it needs to get better (eg. the more platinum you own etc)? A better description than &quot;Item Type Charm Charm Effect: CHRMPlateWeapon&quot; would be nice.<br />
<br />
Has there been any charms found outside LoY zones or do we think this is a future addition just like the multiple focus item roll outs we were getting?<br />
<br />
If an item described here doesn't have a Charm Effect does that mean its unknown or are there charm items which just purely have unmodifying stats?<br />
<br />
If anyone can clear these up would be most appreciated as these items are non-existant outside LoY (I have yet to hear of one mentioned in game) they still have me confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kulothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the stats given were the ones at the time of inspection.  They change since i have seen the Charm of Solitude with two different stats.  The ones without stats are from Lucy.   Until someone Identifies them we probably wont know what triggers them.  So far, they have only been found in LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tilerin Tidestream</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anyone know where the Ivory Fang Figurine drops? I would really love using that charm slot to let me upgrade from that square helm I have been using since velious came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you sure Mammoth Tusk Powder drops out side the fort? I have heard it drops inside but can't confirm it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TryonB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've heard from 2 other places it drops from the Trolls inside.  I Octo-kited initiates for 3 hours last night and didn't get one, a guild mate said she pulled something from inside (didn't say what, but was pulling from the trolls) and got one like immediately.  I was so pissed I wasted 3 hours killing greenies I logged, but was happy for her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bavaral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just got a Mammoth Tusk Powder off a Broken Skull Augur inside the throne room in the big castle in Gunthak.  Took almost 20 hours of camping to get it though so not sure if I'm just unlucky or they hellishly killed the drops.  I was currently at 280 wis/ 119 agi with just druid buffs and only got sta4 mana9 dis2 cold2 off it so take that however you want it hehe.  Glad I got the slot filled but the stats are really lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unless they add end game charms, the new slot does not seem worth the effort.<br />
<br />
yes, something is better than nothing, but I am not at all sure that the very minor stat gains are worth losing a lot of AA time...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sildan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I notice that all the charms found thus far are no drop items.<br />
<br />
Kind of interesting that there is a CHARM slot option in the bazaar search window.<br />
<br />
There very well may be interesting twists we have yet to discover. Droppable charms? Player Crafted perhaps?<br />
<br />
I'll keep watching<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bizitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">On and off, spent about 5-7 hours in the Gunthak temple camping this. Finally dropped off a mutant slave on the way to the throne room.<br />
<br />
Stats at 300 wis 147 agi: sta 5 mana 13 svd/c 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just because the bazaar has a charm filter doesn't mean there are any that are droppable, it may only be of use to those on the FV server where just about everything is droppable.  I heard reports of people selling charms there for around 100k when LoY was first released. :evil:   Personally I think all charms will be no drop and only drop in LoY zones so that non-LoY users will not be able to acquire or equip them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kulothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It bothers me that Neraik has a quest for a charm but we haven't found any other quests yet.  Seems to me that if the SK's have one that at least Pallies should have one.  Question is which Pallies since there are Erudite, Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome and Frog pallies.   Has anyone checked with our guild leaders for a new quest lately? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Duralupal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Picked up a charm that increases in power the more uncommon languages you know.  Being an illiterate druid, I know....none :p   -- taught myself Combine from a vah shir 2-box twink, but, that didn't trigger it.  I'm guessing has to be pure NPC languages.  Anybody else seen this charm and know what effects it gives?  I'm betting int but I hope some raw mana comes in the deal as well, might be worth learning a few languages for kicks if so.<br />
<br />
Edit: got impatient, learned some languages and figured the charm out myself.  Like most of the charms it's not stellar, but, it's not a waste of time imo -- the wisdom you can gain from it comes in at about the same rate as doing planar power or innate enlightment would (well, to be fair I am figuring that with having two accounts -- since the charm is about learning languages this is a two account or VERY patient friend charm).<br />
<br />
Charm of Exotic speach<br />
Per NPC language 1 cha .5 wis .5 int 1 DR<br />
<br />
So with something like 12 or so (roughly) NPC languages you could build the charm up to 12 cha 6 int 6 wis 12 DR.  Like I said, not stellar, but, if your wis isn't capped or you face it not being capped with another level or two or a bit more planar power or innate enlightment (the boat I'm in), it's probably worth the time.</div></div><hr />

Luggalds aren't too hard if you can get them solo. With 65 paladin pulling with pacify we still got adds. Crowd control is the key.<br />

It's the middle spawn in a small room, a bit to the left, before you go down the final downslope to the big event room.  Room with 3 spawns and a firepit.  PHs are easy to solo, aggro range is small.  Seer is tough solo, but easy duo or better. <br />
<br />
 No charm yet from him tho, I went and got a charm of deception for now, although I don't particularly like DE form.</div></div><hr />

To me thats completely retarded but this is SOE and the ever loving rare mobs and their rare to non existant loot. A charm in this case. Would be nice if the mob actually spawned so I could at least 'feel' like I had a shot at it :P<br />

Well, with 203kpp it still has &lt;strong&gt;no stats&lt;/strong&gt;.  I sure hope this is broken and they don't actually expect people to keep more then this much plat either on you or in the bank.  I tried both BTW.  What gives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bigskyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As mentioned above, this is a neck item, not charm slot. Only purpose of this post it to update the drop location as we looted it off the named engineer/archetect (Vulag?) for the wizard 44 level spell in Dulak. In the first big domed warehouse to left as you enter the zone from Gunthak.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Just little info on Cabin Gnome Fitzgerald, he is soloable with one of the wharf rats, to get to him easily just take the long route to the other side of the ship, going underneath invis, watch for some mobs that occasionally see invis, once you pop on deck on other side go to the doors that will be on your left if facing back towards the front of the ship, charm your rat and clear the 2 door mobs, pull the rest from inside the room.  Only need to pull the first 2 mobs at the cannon then kill mob at bottom of steps.  Cabin Gnome was waiting at top of steps into next room.  Just hasted my pet sicked it on him and nuked with winters frost while my pet killed him.  He went down pretty fast, but I'd imagine it could get pretty nasty as he does summon and isn't rootable/snareable.  Got the charm of solitude which is fun to use while no one is on late at night.</div></div><hr />
