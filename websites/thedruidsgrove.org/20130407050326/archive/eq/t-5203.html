Is it now available via GreatDivide or something?<br />

I've been bound there forever it seems and if it is now available to &quot;everyone&quot; from this ease of access, I can feel better about changing my bind :p<br />

Really any info would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The zone in is directly South of Thurg...follow the river to the other side of the zone.<br />
<br />
And I haven't visited PoM yet, so could not tell ya.  :(  Maybe, someone will post if it is safe or not.</div></div><hr />

Also I don't think anything saw invis (but I didn't go near any named mobs to see if they saw through it).<br />
<br />
Some of the deeper in stuff ranges up to level 65... pretty nice exp for a good group.</div></div><hr />

I got ported to a theatre... got smashed by the lone rangers... sucked hehe.. kinda sucks they took the &quot;mischief&quot; out of it... with all the weird things npcs would say.. there was some adventure and intrigue.. but its more or less a smash ****e for loot zone now...</div></div><hr />

I've never been to PoM.  But it sounded fun.<br />
<br />
I wish they had just made the entrance easier to get to like they did but only did minor tweaking of mobs and loot.<br />
<br />
Too bad they didn't listen to people who knew and loved the place.</div></div><hr />

I'd just gotten there after four years of playing, and was plotting out what I might do there for the next year or two or three. But they killed it, and somehow nothing else seems to catch my fancy. <br />
<br />
Like Fanra says, I wish they'd fixed the zone it was, and not changed it into a carbon copy of every other zone in the game. But that would take imagination, I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Grand Cape of Fortune (http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm10.showMessage?topicID=95.to  pic) or Soft Leather Pants of Vitality (http://pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm10.showMessage?topicID=100.t  opic) drop from a buried treasure chest in the forest. You spawn the chest by turning in 4 Mischief Mushroom Spores to Nahas the Treasure Hunter also in the forest. Note that Nahas can also fail to spawn the chest for you.<br />
<br />
Fetid Hide Boots (www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=62345) drops from a funky skunk, a blue-con named in the forest.<br />
<br />
Fungus Covered Wristband (www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=62342) drops from an irritating mushroom, a blue-con named in the forest.<br />
<br />
Amusing Bauble (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=62346) drops from a named bee in the forest. Name is something like Bzzibidana. Bee sees invis.<br />
<br />
Cloak of the Jester (pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm10.showMessage?topicID=94.to  pic) drops from The Grand Gardener, a named mini in the garden where Ferjeneror used to be.<br />
<br />
Robe of Dissolution (pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm10.showMessage?topicID=99.to  pic) drops from an ample ape in AiW 3's old Brenn and Grenn room.<br />
<br />
Mask of the Performer (pub57.ezboard.com/ftheplaneofmischieffrm10.showMessage?topicID=101.t  opic) drops from a non-named performer behind the stage.<br />
<br />
The Bunny Behemoth reportedly drops similar junk in Stomples' old room.<br />
<br />
There is also a ring event in the big chessboard room. No info on what drops there. No one seems interested in the event.<br />
<br />
Bristlebane spawns in his throne room when you kill the Mischievous Jester. Again, few if any seem interested. No word on what drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That loot is pretty much crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">10-12-2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not crap to everyone and it's better than the quested garbage from before.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I went there last night with an exp group to poke around. I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. The zone is basically the same except some of the mobs look pretty cool now and give better experience. And what's even better is that you can get your melee buddies to join you without having to worry about them dying without a rez.<br />
<br />
You can get around most of the zone with inviz.<br />
<br />
Druids can charm gorillas who hit for 350. I charmed one and went to town.<br />
<br />
Give the place a chance. You might still like it. I think the changes are for the better personally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like he'd be pretty fun to do if maybe boss mobs weren't down and you have a couple people that wanna do a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mdcythe</div><div class="date">10-13-2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, 12~ of my guildies and myself (Ele/vt equipped) went over to PoM and see what was up with this jester and Bristlebane.<br />
<br />
We ported into jester and dropped that fool like he was a sack of potatoes. PoV mobs have put up more of a fight than him...<br />
<br />
Anyways, I checked track, noticed BB was up - hurray! We ported into his hallway by clicking the SW painting, and began prepping.  5 minutes later we engaged and were just a bit surprised by some of his AE's/proc. <br />
<br />
Here's the skinny: Proc is a 180% aggro reducer, with chromadic resist check - need to have MT with highest resists possible in everything. Bard is a must. The curse is cured with two casts of RCG. The ae, to put it bluntly, sucks. Illusion:Halfling, 80% snare and HP/Mana DoT. Like I said, sucks. Resists at -250 mr...<br />
<br />
We went again, but with only two clerics, weren't able to keep it up long enough to put a serious dent in him. Got him down to 89% best try. I would estimate 200k hps+.<br />
<br />
Might go back one of these days and finish him off with some more. In short, doable with VT/ele gear, but need at least 24/36 for a good shot at killing him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch, -99% aggro modifier.  Heh.<br />
<br />
I notice both that and the AE have Illusion: Halfling components to them...must be fun :)<br />
<br />
Would have been even more fun if they used Donlo's Dance Party too...<br />
