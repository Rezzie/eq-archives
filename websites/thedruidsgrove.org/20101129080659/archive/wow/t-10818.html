You just have to learn to manage mana consumption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use barkskin while in melee and renewing MF, its not just for channeling spells.  The extra 20% damage mitigation can make a real difference, and it has no effect on your instant spells.<br />
<br />
Dropping to bear to heal is a good strategy at your level, if you have good AC leather pieces on for moonki armor it will be the same bear armor, then enrage and get a frenzied regen as soon as you can.  When you need to heal again bash and shift to heal then shift back up to moonkin, you will have regened mana in the meantime.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to use all forms, your still a druid.</div></div><hr />

Cat form stealth, ravage, put up some combo points, FB, shift out to heal, back into cat form and onto the next mob.  No downtime.  But to each his own.  If you like to stand back and cast spells rather than getting up close and personal, go moony.  Yeah, i know moonies melee too for ooc procs...</div></div><hr />

I stay in moonkin until I either draw more than one mob in which case I go bear for the swipe, or when I am out of mana. When out of mana I cast innervate shift cat take on a mob or two and tadah mana is back. When innervate is on cool down I just stay in cat longer.</div></div><hr />

This is what I am talking about people! Using all your tools to make the most of how you like to play.  Just because you spec moonkin doesn't mean you can't use feral forms.</div></div><hr />

You can also do a little bit around Booty Bay.  I can't remember the levels in Badlands, so that might be another option.</div></div><hr />

They are heck-o-powerful and not many people know about them on my server, people kept thinking I was talking about purification potions.</div></div><hr />

Elemental earth drops fairly often from these guys, as well as some decent greens, and that all sells well on my server - plus it got me from 36 to 38 in a couple of days of questing &amp; grinding.<br />
<br />
There's also a quest chain that will get you a nifty trinket that gives burst run speed for when you don't want to shift forms. Just keep in mind you'll need a frost oil (AH or alchemist) and a gyrochronatom (IF Engineering Supplies vendor in the gnome area).</div></div><hr />
