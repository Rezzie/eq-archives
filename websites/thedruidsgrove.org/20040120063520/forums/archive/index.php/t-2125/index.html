<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Danca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw someone reporting solo exp after the patch saying they soloed in PoFire for a ton of exp.  I have access to the zone, but not many of my friends do.  It would be nice to have a place that is relatively uncamped that had very nice exp reward but I'm not sure where to go.  I haven't gone beyond just zoning into the zone to take a peak.  Any hints?</div></div><hr />

Avoid doomfire pulling &quot;chaplain&quot; they are casters and will heal themselves, the others one do not summon even if they cons red, they have around 44khp and give 14% AA xp by kill (after patch).<br />

Have fun )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cloudwulfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i've also seen another druid Quad at second castle... not sure how long it takes and if it's better then root/dot.<br />
<br />
haven't tried to solo in fire since i'm satisfied with &quot;just&quot; group XP... far less dangerous.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crysivil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally duo with a rogue. We get around 8-10% a kill and takes us approx 4 minutes to take each down. We get an AA in a little less than an hour. A mage would work just as good too or combine them both. Should still be very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>HaggleHappyfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I mostly group or duo/trio for exp in fire but if did solo it would be in the 2nd castle area that was described and I usually dot/kited with some nukes thrown in.   The best xp I've had there though was quadding the red cons in the 2nd castle area near the picnic table with me, a mage/enc, and another druid or wizard.  Mage/enc lower the mobs mr and nuke and you and the other druid or wizard cast quad spells on them while one druid/wizard uses ae snare + quad spells to maintain aggro.   Works great and the ae is just awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>treantil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i use to quad at second castle with C5 on. it takes me 15 minutes. Was 72 percent AA xp per quad before solo nerf and now it's 52 percent ( not that bad ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Straatius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So it is possible to solo Quad in Fire? I better try it sometime :) <br />
