I'm abit rusty now on the numbers and for which stat to chase for exactly due to the &quot;real world&quot; catching up to me...so I'm no rookie, but no expert either.<br />
<br />
Should I go resto and aim for pure spellpower?  Stamina and resilience?<br />
Or should I go bear mode and go for stamina/resilience?<br />
<br />
I hope this made sense, the caffeine ran out of my system just as I got back home today.</div></div><hr />

I'm rocking roughly 1000 resil in my feral PvP set and still get wtfpwned when i take on multiple players... i can tell you that it takes more than myself (even blowing all my CDs) to take down a tree.<br />
<br />
you shouldn't have to worry that much about gemming for resil... one of the +20 resil gems should be fine to get you around 1000 if you're in any of the passed 2 season's gear... my suggestion would be to gem and chant for SP (maybe a crit here or there for your LB blooms, regrowth crits (om nom nommy) and nourish crits.<br />

just my .02</div></div><hr />

Should I also then replace my spellpower+haste gems with spellpower+crit?  I'm used to playing tank, so caster stuffs is a foreign thing to me.<br />

Side note:<br />
I thought I'd never see the day that I'd be enjoying resto.  I think alittle part of me died inside. :behindcom</div></div><hr />

<br />
linky please<br />
<br />
i completely hear what you're saying about not thinking you'd enjoy resto, and i can relate... I'm feral to the core, even back in the BC days when resto druid/warrior comps were pwning face in arena, i couldn't see myself making that switch, and still can't see it in the near future, especially with how much more fun feral has become.<br />
<br />
I got my &quot;with a little helper from my friends&quot; achievement by donning my resto PvP gear, with a feral spec (it's all gear from lucky, or unlucky, depending on how you look at it, drops from Vault and when i HAD to spend honor because i was at the cap and had no other feral gear that i needed) , heading into the daily BG (which was SotA) and healing the piss out of myself while alli just kept dying around me... we can't shift forms once we become the little elves, so i didn't really have a choice, but it was a LOT easier than i thought it would be... EJ has a thread titled: Season (x): Rise of the Tree Tank, and they're right on... i think i got that achievement in 2 BG's...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm abit of a slacker, and the resto is for both pve and pvp.</div></div><hr />
