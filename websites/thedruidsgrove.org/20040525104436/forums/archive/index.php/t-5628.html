<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nanyea The Wayward</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was strolling by FOH guildsite... and they have a new update on the front page.<br />
<br />
All i got to say is doing it right the first time...<br />
<br />
p.s. I wanna know more about the casters, night elfs and druids!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nimchip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this game is gonna own,<br />
however it's stupid how FoH is using their site hits to get people into WoW...<br />
<br />
FoH + Blizzard $$$ = WoW previews</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*yawns* WoW is just going to be another level grind to the loot game, but this time you'll have to deal with all the Blizzard game fanboy's as well who, a lot of them, will be the first time they've played a MMOG.  And I stress, MMOG, not MMORPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aly's got a point...  WoW more than any other game in recent memory will have a *huge* fanboy population to start, not to mention absolutely gigantic expectations, and thats not a particularly good thing.  An MMOG filled with jaded EQ'ers, refugee AO'ers, bored SWG'ers, and large number former Diablo-ites expecting the same sort of gameplay....<br />
<br />
Should be interesting, anyway.  I do hope it's a good game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Panamah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My own particular fear is having the most notoriously hard core uber guild ever prodding them early on, I think it's going to be lacking in things casual players want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol im pretty sure FoH has that covered... either Blizzard is offering them $$$ or 1337 B3T4 1NF0Z!</div></div><hr />

My own particular fear is having the most notoriously hard core uber guild ever prodding them early on, I think it's going to be lacking in things casual players want.  <br />
<br />
I remember a few updates ago at the Blizzard forums the developers stated how they were trying to balance the game for all types of players, whether they be hard core raiders or casual players.  For them to actually succeed at the elusive concept of balance is quite another thing.<br />
<br />
WoW looks like it will own but I hope they work on the character models some more.  That female human warrior fighting Sneed's Shredder with a katana has totally the wrong proportions.  Her legs look way too long compared to the rest of her body and those boots she has on are wider than her torso lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dennis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cartoons dude, cartoons.<br />
<br />
The game look sgood, but I completely agree with Panamah's concern.  Then again, the &quot;casual&quot; gamer has absolutely no reason to spend $10-20 a month on a video game after already dropping $50+ on it.  But yet another way to look at it is if it were not for the -majority- of payers being casual players in a game built for the hard-cores.. blah blah.. MMORPGs are a waste of time ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cantatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think WoW could be a fun game.  They are doing some innovative things instead of, &quot;Hey, let's copy EQ and add a few things!&quot;  like almost all of the other MMOGs that are due out soon.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I hope this game (or any game) is wildly successful because the MMOG industry really needs one instead of flop after flop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think when WoW comes out that will be one of the biggest removals of players in EQ since EQ's start imho.<br />
<br />
EQ is dying with a poor expansion like LDON and people want something more than what LDON offered.<br />
<br />
Question is....can SoE bring some amazing expansion out....or EQ2 before WoW comes out.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh and regarding FoH.  They lost any credibility they had since Furors ill quit if you dont do xxx thing.  I dont even look at their site anymore and I used to check reguarly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>B_Delacroix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">EQ for me is for boosting my guild's confidence (which it seems then need regular infusions of.  - Funny how they seem to settle down into the &quot;We can't do that&quot; mode so fast. -)<br />
<br />
I've been playing with Civ3 Conquests lately and having much more fun for a lot less money.<br />
<br />
EQ was a nice experiment in a different game type, but I don't think MMOG are for me.  I do think, however, that too many companies are churning out MMOGs just because of EQs success.  One person is successful so everyone else copies it.<br />
<br />
The most fun I had when networked games first came out was four player COOPERATIVE play of Doom.  NOT Deathmatch.  However, I don't see any cooperative play games coming out, everyone toots the deathmatch horn.<br />
<br />
I think Mechwarrior (before it was so cheesed by simplistic control and mech design) would have been great fun with a set of cooperative play missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ever played System Shock 2 in cooperative mode (the only available multiplayer mode)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Milwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Continuing on the side note, co-op Halo is a nice challenge, esp. if you have a friend or relative sitting around with you on a slow day :). I have the Xbox version, but I assume that co-op is built in to the PC version too, hopefully...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree and i do the same thing...  i just hate how they crowned themselves the kings of eq and declared their site a Hit magnet and use it against SoE and pro- blizzard. that's just wrong.</div></div><hr />
