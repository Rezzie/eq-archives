<br />
There is my magelo. Currently I have FT10... tho I would like that maxed out. Really what I am looking for here is some insight and advice on what I could realistically replace at this level. Things that aren't out of my reach. Thanks in advance! :)<br />
<br />
If at all possible could you point me in the direction any of the items you might suggest would come from! :) Thanks again! <br />

Although, at 65 you will most likely want to snag the rest of your FT...upgrading to grandmasters armor would help there I imagine.</div></div><hr />

Best bet would be to wait till 65+ and then re-evaluate your possibilities since you'll have a lot more options with the required level 65 met.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would focus a bit on getting toward 65 for now, your gear is actually quite good for your level. The higher level will open up more cultural gear as Neutra has said. While your leveling, you can hit DS and Bloodfields, places like that where you can pickup some faction for Greenvale. Can also hang out in Causeway with Ark and Xylophone if you want for xp, faction, and nodrop components of that armor.<br />

I ended up with a rag-tag set of gear with Dark Ember (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=30143) as one of the more impressive pieces.  Everybody starts the game with a weapon, a tunic, a guild scroll, and some food and drink (and now a backpack and sense heading maxed... lucky bastards =p).</div></div><hr />
