Spirit shrouds were introduced way back in Depths of Dark Hallow expansion September 13, 2005.  Here is the   information from Eqplayers website (http://eqplayers.sony.com) under their game updates area.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spirit Shrouds ** <br />
 <br />
--Shroudkeepers have learned to channel spirits in the ethereal world.  They are found in the Plane of Knowledge and can offer you the form of one of Norrath's creatures through a Spirit Shroud! The Shroudkeepers can transform you into creatures in various categories, like Undead or Animal. The Spirit Shroud itself changes your form and gives you a specific set of abilities, like a fighter or healer, depending on the shroud you picked. Once you've selected a shroud type, you can choose to play a creature of that type of any available level less than or equal to your own level.<br />
<br />
--While you adventure with a Spirit Shroud, you will gain experience for your main character.  When you remove your shroud, the items you collected will appear in your Shroud Storage which is accessed at a banker.  Also, as you use the Spirit Shrouds in a particular category you will gain enough knowledge and experience to unlock new forms.<br />
<br />
<br />
I.  Shroud Basics<br />
<br />
Ok let&#8217;s start by finding the shroudkeepers.   As far as I know there are two of them in plane of knowledge.  The first one Shroudkeeper Nisau is   near the large bank in Plane of Knowledge at location 81, 456, and -93.   The second one is Shroudkeeper Learu at location 301, 636, and -104.  Does not matter which one you visit both give you access to the same shrouds.<br />
<br />
Each Shroud will start with a Backpack with   20 food, 20 water and 20 bandages (note bandages will be named different things depending on the shroud you get).     Each shroud may get a Weapon.   Shrouds are not allowed any type of gear beside what they start with.   Shrouds can use all potions, all foods / drink, and regular bandages.     Shrouds can access the bank of character that is shrouded.   It is a good idea to keep a few empty backpacks their for your shroud use.<br />
<br />
You can remove a shroud at any time, by simply visiting a shroudkeeper and saying   &#8220;remove&#8221;.     When you do this any all coin you have collected while adventuring with a shroud will be automatically transferred to your shrouded character.    Any bags or items in said bags will be put into a special shroud bank.    At the time you remove shroud this special shroud bank will open up allowing you to move items and bags onto the now unshrouded character.   Shroud Banks have 48 hour timer.    I have not yet risked seeing what happens when you leave something in shroud bank over the 48 hour limit and don&#8217;t wish to try.<br />
<br />
Shrouds do not get spell gems like characters do, Instead you get set of skills   listed under your alternate advancement window.   The higher the level shroud you choose the more abilities that a shroud will have access too.    You will not just be able to use all the Abilities; instead you will get special AA points   called Monster points.    The amount of points you get will vary by the level shroud you pick.   Just like alternate advancement the skill available will vary in cost and the amount you can increase each one.  Some of the basic abilities for the particular shroud will be filled in and you will not have to increase them.  <br />
<br />
To use ability you will have to make a &#8220;HOT KEY&#8221; and drag it toward your hot button bar.   It is recommended that you use hot bar sets 8 through 10 for shrouds so you do not interfere with any hot button sets that you have setup for your character.  Click on ability in the alternate advancement window will show what it does.<br />

As you can see each type of shroud has 1 to 5 tiers.  You will only have access to the <br />
Tier (A) subtypes.  As you kill stuff and gain XP you will gain percentage progress in the current shroud subtype you are working on. Within your Character view in game you will have a shroud tab you can click on.  Within in this tab you will see all the current shrouds you are working on and the percentage you have completed to opening the next tier of the shroud subtype you are working on.  You will unlock the shroud subtype in order from (a) to max for the subtype you are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glunier</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">II.	Shroud Unlocking methods<br />
<br />
Method #1:   <br />
This by far the fastest method, but those require a friend or having a second account.   You will be power leveling your shrouded.   Have character to be doing shroud unlock shroud into a level 5 shroud of your choice, and then proceed to run both the shrouded character and the one to power level to Palaudal caverns  shadowwaver thicket zone line.   The tunnel from zone line leads to a cavern with a lack with bunch of beetle and mushrooms around it.   Buff up the shrouded character and put best damage shield on it.  Then just have shrouded character run around whacking mobs for at least 1 hit point of damage and let them die on damage shield.  This method will gain you access to each tier of a shroud at rate of 30 to 40minutes per tier.<br />
<br />
Method #2:<br />
This second method will take a bit longer than #1, but can be done solo.    Shroud into a level 5 shroud of your choice.  Make sure you have enough platinum to buy 10 type II alacrity, Health, and healing potions.  You will also need 20 to 40 Skinspike II potions (gives 15pt damage shield). Proceed to any newby zone and buff up with potions and damage shield.  Now just run around the newby yard and whack any mobs you see for at least 1 pt of damage and run around letting mobs die on damage shield or kill them outright.  This method will gain you access to each tier of a shroud at a rate of 1hr to 1hr 15min per tier.<br />
<br />
Method #3:<br />
This is by far the longest method as you will shroud to a spirit shroud closest to you level and go grind Experience in whatever zone groups you wish too.  This method will get you much better Experience rates for your unshroud toon than method #1 or #2, but at the cost of many hours for each tier to be unlocked.  <br />
<br />
III. XP gained On Shrouded Character<br />
<br />
prior to today 3/16/09 I had some data here as how my druid Experience gains etc. The bottom line is that the closest shroud level you choose to your toon the better the XP you will earn while shrouding. It also should be stated that you will almost always get better Experience rates just staying in your non shrouded toon, but you loose the versatility that shroud can give you when you LFG. <br />
<br />
One of the repeated questions i get is how much AA Experience I get when shrouding. I averaged 3 to 3.5 AA per hour while leveling my druid in shroud form at various times throughout levels 62 to 65. a lot of those times i was in a level 50 or 55 shrouds in various appropriate zones. I am sure if you get the ideal group most folks can probably get better than that.<br />
<br />
From all my grinding to unlock each shroud i have come to conclude that each tier of a shroud type requires a little Experience than the previous to unlock. This seems appropriate since when you review all the shroud types you will notice that higher tiers shroud will be better in stat line or abilities available than similar shrouds that lower tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you can see from my previous Shroud Basics, each shroud has a basic everquest class that its abilities best reflect.   This does not mean you will have full access to the same spells/abilities lists as that class type.   In fact depending on shroud you use you may have access to a variety of class spells/abilities through shroud abilities.  For Example the Abberations shroud subtype tier (c) or tier 3, you can cast a charm spell even though most of your abilities are those of the wizard class.<br />
<br />
Another Example of this is The Abberations shroud subtype (b) you gain access to a shaman like spell malaise which lowers a targets resistances.<br />
<br />
All the skill under skill tab will not be posted.   These skills are at max or 75 percent of max for the level subtype shroud you will be playing.<br />

 <br />
A few things to add from personal experience.  This was done before the Shroud Nerf way back when so not really sure how your gaining AA's or how the new system works.<br />
 <br />
If unlocking shrouds is your 100% goal, PC is the only place you ever need to visit.  Second, Druids are 100% better to PL than a Chanter.  What you need....<br />
...DS potions and haste potions (doesn't help a whole lot but every bit counts)...thats it!  Druid provides Skin (if you don't wanna ask/get Temp but I recomend on caster shrouds), Regen, SoW, and Spikes.<br />
 <br />
Shroud to lvl 5!  Use the Shar Vahl stone and enter PC from this zone in side.  Bring your trusty druid with you :dance:   Once inside PC, group with the druid, type /follow, and then disband the druid (Only gotten this to work when you boxing on seperate systems) otherwise you have to manually move druid to you when you need heals or buffs.<br />
 <br />
Now run around, wack the beetle/shroom and do 1 damage and move on to the next one.  The respawn is fast, you have a nice little &quot;track&quot; to run circles in (around the lake), and the DS will kill 'em off.  No time waisting trying to swing at 'em.  I averaged unlocking a shroud every 40 minutes, 60 minutes if it was a caster (boxed).<br />
 <br />
Best way to get the OT gate hammer if your &quot;good&quot;, Iksar, or spent too munch time destroying Kurns Castle and Howling Stones.<br />
 <br />
As a side note:  What level range has been your best at grabbing AA's an hour.  I could grab 6 AA's/shroud level before the nerf but your reporting 3 AA's a shroud level.  You gotten anything better?  Guildy was reporting about the same at level 50 and 55 Shroud so really curiouse.  Shrouding for AA's was always fun, numbing but fun so I'm very interested in your further observations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mascha</div><div class="date">01-11-2009, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting posts, Kodos to you.<br />
<br />
I am however interested how the AA and real exp gain works. I have played around with shrouds and powerleveling some but did not pay enough attention to compare the exp gained per hour while shrouded/unshrouded. Can anyone add some information to that?<br />
<br />
The real exp gained at the crocs with a 68 wizzard/then shrouded to 55 wizzard seemed to be much better, but I do not have enough palytime at the moment to test this extensively.</div></div><hr />

It'll be nice if can add number of available points for purchasing the abilities, and even better if can give recommendations on what to purchase.<br />
 <br />
Also, in Monster Missions there are ability points to purchase (like Nagafen).  It'll be nice if someone can give a guide similar to this one.</div></div><hr />
