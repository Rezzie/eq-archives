 <br />
Healing/buffing are important aspects of our tool kit but where are my detrimental focii?  We do nuke and debuff, focii that affect these ablities would be kinda nice to be on our quest armor or leather armor.  Instead we get 3 focii everytime it seems:  Healing, Benef distance, and Ice focii.<br />
 <br />
Fire isn't that hard to get, but detrimental focus for duration and distance have gotten stupid rare on gear we can use.  I know its gonna massively overpower the game if my debuffs stay on longer and our dots last longer.  If they feel our dot dps will become out of balance (boggle) then they need to make a focus that affects debuff style detrimental only and put it on leather trash gear (ie. bracers).<br />
 <br />
Anyway rant off.</div></div><hr />

Up to lvl 67 spells and crap range. I'm presently wearing 3 types of gm armor for situational focuses, ne of which is det haste and put that on sleeves since most of our sleeve slots lack any type of focus at all. WTB DP lvl focus upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise search item :  Lambent Stone Of Focus<br />
<br />
And i agree a druid power is very nerfed unless we find a way to boost DoTs.  I like the nuking end of what we do but having longer lasting and more powerful dots would be nice.. This may not have anything to do with it but a Necro has Super DoTs, Can heal, Can lifetap, Can Nuke, and can make clicky heal stone for themselves.. Seems a lil unfair to me..</div></div><hr />

The downside being you often have to spend ALOT of time farming to get it (money or components),  which for some is a pain or not very fun/productive use of time.<br />
 <br />
GM leather tunic/legs are roughly 150k on our Dro,  rest around 50-100.<br />
GM chest/leg augs run 50-70k,  rest around 40k.<br />
Mechanoinstruction around 45-70k depending on focus.<br />
AAAA's 150-200k.<br />
 <br />
So if I got everything cheap i'd still be spending around 350-400k for a chest or leg piece,  250-300k for other slots.  I farm while exp in instanced nests with my 3 box and even I find that to be alot of money.<br />
 <br />
It has been a tad of a pain to juggle around and find detrimental focus,  saving up to just buy det haste on a piece of GM armor atm.  Kinda annoying that my options really run with (buying a nearly same stat necklace just to get det preservation or farm up enough to buy GM of similar content stats).  My origional idea was to wear alot of GM / last blood / bazu stuff,  until I figured out the price,  i'll wear 1-2 tops for the focus that are high demand / low availiblity.</div></div><hr />

Finding a friendly gnome to do the tinkering can be a pain, but most guilds have several skilled smithers. Just ask around if your guildies can help you. Nimchip made my GM helm/symbol, and I farmed everything for the 4A and armor with Swift (ranger). So the only cost for my new spiffy helm was the ore and a few gems-less than 15k iirc.</div></div><hr />

How about the following two spells:<br />
<br />
Karana's water torture<br />
Group castable only, 900 mana. Causes 12 damage per tick for 3600 seconds<br />
<br />
Tunare's fluffy pillow<br />
Group castable only. 1200 mana. Causes 18 damage per tick for 3600 seconds<br />
<br />
<br />
Surely that is vastly overpowered :)<br />

Well I make my own armor and symbols. Additionally i make armor and symbols for my guildies too. We have a tinkerer and other tinkering bots that help us with that. I farm all the stuff... the price is 20-25k if you farm all the stuff. It's not hard for a druid either.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to find any wood elven tailors on Dro who wont charge me a fortune even if I do provide the components,  tempting me to make my own tailor in my off time hehe.</div></div><hr />

Another thing, last blood pieces are the best pieces for helm and arms slot.</div></div><hr />

Im going to stick with my everspring hat for a while but agree on arm slots,  though im finding it to be good for chest slot too,  just because ive been disapointed with focus in what we have available.  <br />
 <br />
The chest im working on is Diamond Coldain for type 7,  GM for type 11 and Last Blood of the Traveller for det haste.  Farming hides/scales just to sell because it'll be cheaper to buy a GM chest at a set price then hope that the tailor succeeds.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Agreed, kinda aggrivating to see some newer items with nice focus with little to no mods, that are just god awful. &gt;&lt; Ah well juggling focus an insane ammount of focus, the life of a druid. <br />
 <br />
I predict we shall soon see the following on our next tunic :<br />
 <br />
LAWL Tunic of HAHAHAHA<br />
Divination spec mod<br />
Strikethrough 10%<br />
Combat Effects 10<br />
Improved Block 5!<br />
Flying Kick +20<br />
Det or Bene 20% mana pres because we all have trouble finding a item with either of those...<br />
And a +5% mana pres on some spell, which we're all happy to see! /sarcasm off <br />
 <br />
Anyways im all vented out.</div></div><hr />
