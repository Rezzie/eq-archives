Just wondering, what else'd you consider as ultimate druid toy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously... a dire charmed pet in PoP is better then a mistwalker pet used to be pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
How times change...<br />
<br />
I would say the best &quot;toy&quot; for a druid... Dark Mace of Thought... free 400 mana per proc.. Droooooool....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sekira Ashdelane</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When it first dropped, the MW pet was a real pet...  just with a low number of hit points.  You could /pet back off before he got killed and hang onto him.  Then you could buff him up, etc.<br />
<br />
Guilds with a number of rangers/druids were passing around the MW until everyone had a buffed up level 45 dog pet prior to attacking big mobs.  Since the MW pet can hit for 100-140 (if I remember right) and has double attack, that is a decent pet army for people who didn't normally have pets to be bringing into a fight.<br />
<br />
Then the pet was changed so that he attacks for 1 round and then dies.  I think he also has 1 hit point as well, and they restricted HP buffs so that they can't be cast on a target with less than 20 hit points.<br />
<br />
Finally, the proc rate was lowered, then raised, then lowered again...  It definately doesn't proc very often anymore, at least in druidic hands...  I put on a cloak of flames and pulled out my Mistwalker for the Druid Best of the Best back in the day and surprised the hell out of people who didn't know what it was (Xev is a split server and MW had been removed from the drop tables before Xev existed, so there aren't many of them around).  I didn't win, but it was fun :)</div></div><hr />

It also makes giants, rats, spiders, orcs, goblins, fish, fire beetles, brownies, zombies, vampires, kobolds, gnolls, gargoyles, other players, angry gnomes, fairies, pixies, treants, piles of goo, golems, skeletons, big angry rockpile things, undead shade things, shiknar, thought leeches, angry mushrooms... etc. fly.<br />

Like how anyone can become a woodelf now but anyone can't be dark elves since they changed that.  Rather ironic that they originally changed that, now anyone can be a woodelf!  Granted it's much harder, but still :)</div></div><hr />

Now they throw out a WE Illusion. Now the 100 dollar question is which faction helps a player more. Good races or bad races?<br />

Alas, people are wise to me now -- it was so much fun responding to the &quot;WTF?&quot;s with anything from &quot;Druid ancient spell/aa ability&quot; to &quot;I think it was that monk over there with the water staff.&quot;<br />

Am currently working on wood elf crown (Biz is a hobbit), but my other favorites are:<br />

Brell's Fishin' Pole (AT stuck at 190, alas)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kraigor</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since our epic is a 1hs, I figured it was time to bring up my 1hs skill and began looking fora good 1hs weapon. I was using the Ice Shapers Staff, a really good 1hb weapon and was looking for similar stats. The only real option was the mistel toe scimitar used in the earring quest...but those sold for a ridiculous amount of plat (2500-3500).<br />
<br />
I spent a month trolling the Bazaar waiting for the prices of the mistel toe to fall. Then one day I saw an auctioner selling a bunch of druid gear. My jaw dropped when I saw the link:<br />
<br />
Skyfury Scimitar<br />
Dmg 13,  Delay 23   (Base dps 5.65)<br />
Wis +8, Mana +35, SvC +7, SvM +7, wt 5.0<br />
<br />
He wanted something like 8k for it. Knowing that I could not afford it, but knowing that this auctioner was liquidating his druid I began to negotiate and bargin with him. Long story short, I talked him down to 4k + a few trades. <br />
<br />
This weapon rocks and I've never seen another like it. Looked it up on Alakazams and it originates from SkyShrine. Im so poor now im back to porting just to afford my level 49 spells. Btw I got this at level 47 and im level 49 now (dinged a few nights ago).</div></div><hr />

  Grats.  =)  I was dirt broke until I started quadding in Cobalt Scar or grouping in Sebilis.  The amount of money you make off selling gems is almost better than the XP.  =)</div></div><hr />
