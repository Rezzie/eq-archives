Why can't people read the text of their quests??<br />
<br />
:banghead_<br />
<br />
I get sooo tired of hearing the same questions over and over and over, when in many cases, if you read the quest text, the place you need to go and the mobs you need to kill are right there!  It makes sense to ask questions if you truly can't find it, but its obvious that some people aren't even bothering to look - they just want someone else to do all the work for them.<br />
<br />
It just pisses me off.  Why do these people think that everyone is going to drop what they are doing to hold their hand and walk them through quests?  What happened to wandering around and finding things yourself?<br />
<br />
OK... I feel a little better now.  :crazeye:</div></div><hr />

Every five minutes the same question would pop up - &quot;Where's the Greenwarden?&quot;  &quot;What boat do I look for the strongbox?&quot; stuff like that.  There was another quest which involved the boat directly south of the harbor and people were asking which of the ghost boats outside of the city they should be looking at.<br />
<br />
When I play with some of my friends who are higher level than me, I'm pretty bad with reading sometimes though.  They hand me a fistfull of quests, I accept and then just mindlessly hit /follow.  They drag me from mob to mob, say, &quot;Loot that,&quot; and then we head back to town and click on the golden ?.  I have no clue what I just did :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somebody told me once, after I told him to look, that he didn't want to waste time. My responce to him was &quot;How do you think I found out?&quot;. He didn't respond. :lol<br />
<br />
I give people hints, but I never tell them their answer. I've gotten some people really peeved, but others where just thankful I didn't berate them in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the quest does not give you an exact location it gives you a relative location, or sometimes you have to find a person that you've already been to, and it just tells you to go see him/her again, however, thats kinda hard to remember if your doing 20 quests at one time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amerylla</div><div class="date">12-23-2004, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really love the lore that goes with the quests.  I feel cheated if I get dragged along for a &quot;loot this&quot;, &quot;click on that&quot; type thing.  Feels like I missed something.<br />
<br />
To top it off, I keep momentos of all sorts of quests.  My bank is full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-24-2004, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reasurance or not. The best way to find out is by doing it yourself. You're more likely to remember it that way than somebody just telling you where.<br />
<br />
Make a guess/theory and then test it out. If that doesn't work, try another guess. If you've exsusted your attempts, ask for tips (never ask for the answer).</div></div><hr />

However the stuff you cant find on thott or that has a diffrent name such as &quot;where are the ghouls in darkshire&quot; because they arent called ghouls is constantly asked. I think they should have a FAQ for each zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">12-27-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have found that sometimes the people with thottbot still ask the zone for specifics rather than read or listen.  <br />
<br />
I was with a group last night doing Sven's revenge and they couldn't find the dark mound..  I kept asking them if they were sure they were at the right house because it didnt match my map...   After clearing everything around the house with no luck the leader admits we are at the wrong house because someone gave him the wrong directions.  I guess a random persons directions were more valid than mine.    <br />
<br />
Sometimes also the spoiler pages are vague and after a while you get frustrated.  Sometimes asking will get you grouped with someone else that is doing the quest or is willing to help with it.</div></div><hr />

I had one quest where you had to look for a guy &quot;just south of town&quot; and he ended up being in the south part of the town. It is frustrating to see all the questions. I am too however guilty of it also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">01-03-2005, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found that the spoiler sites are not that great either..  Of the various maps of ashenvale that I had, only two maps of ashenvale had Night Run marked on them.  The problem was it was marked in two completely different areas..  After two hours of searching I gave up and asked and got directions.  An hour later I finally found it in a different spot than on either of the maps and only after I found it did the directions I got make sence.</div></div><hr />

I was clueless but went along.  Clicking the gold ? made me feel like I had cheated, somehow, though I did the work I didn't understand the why.<br />
<br />
I felt so badly I made a new Human character to go play through from the start there... it's a beautiful area and now I'm appreciating it more.  I'm someone who tries not to ask but there are so many helpful kind people that it's easy to be hand-held when it's offered!!<br />
<br />
I try to help people on quests but only if they understand why we're doing them and where we are going.  That way, they will do the same someday and not just zip through a spoon-fed experience.<br />

<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ has a lot of answers as well. As plentiful, if not more, than the manual that game with the game.<br />
<br />
This isn't Verant or SOE. Blizzard isn't trying to hide every little aspect of the game workings from the player. They openly give you all that information. Everything you need through till level 30 or so. Normally by then you have a good enough grasps on the game, your remaining quests are more about where does X zone reside, how do you get to X instance, all of which can be resovled by use the maps you find on the net or the ones ingame by exploring yourself.<br />
(Even though an area might not be unfogged for you, you can still tell where the zones are, just right click out and hover over the zones until you find the one you need. Then plan your route accordingly)</div></div><hr />
