its beginning to look like spell drops in zones according to level, looks like 76 to 78 spells drop in tier 1-2 zones, 79 - 80 spell's drop in T3 - 4 zones. I have yet to see any rank 2  level 79 or 80 spell drop in a zone outside a tier 3 zone.</div></div><hr />

Probably more plentiful in Crystallos, I would imagine.</div></div><hr />

Steam Factory and Gyrospire Zeka is both T3 zones as well as Meldrath Mansion and Ship, Crystallos is T4 zone.</div></div><hr />

None at all, you just walked in whenever you feel like it with zero keys).<br />
 <br />
It's getting access to the end zone raids via first obtaining the key and then completing some (non-trivial) precursor raids to open the raid access that takes effort.  You'll note that Beyond the Barrier doesn't stop/end once you get the key.</div></div><hr />
