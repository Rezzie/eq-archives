What else are we immune to, other than polymorph?<br />

I've been healing like a madman in the BG's, but as soon as I get in tree form I am insta-targeted.  Probably my favorite thing ever to do tho is get in tree form and waddle up to a bush and kinda make myself at home in the middle, so that all you can really see is my eyes, then start healing.  Either ppl are smart and tab through all possible targets and then focus fire on the tree, or they just dont notice me :)</div></div><hr />

lol, all great suggestions!  How about a 5-man Druid party, so potentially you could have 15 Treants? :sumo:</div></div><hr />

On average, I was dying twice a game, granted when I ws getting attacked, my guildies would try their best to kill my attacker.  And if i was running low on life, throw a hot real quick, and then swiftmend!<br />
<br />
There's so many stories I can talk about surviving I'd probably have an essay by the time I finish :shuffle:  Along with a rogue, we could hold off 5 guys! lol.  But yeh, tol rules.<br />
<br />
As for it being banishable, I've only experienced it once :( But as more warlocks catch on, I'm assuming we'll get banished more often.</div></div><hr />
