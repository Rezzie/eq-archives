When I told her &quot;what rune fragment&quot; she gave me a 6 slot container named &quot;Threadbare Cloth Bag&quot; and 1 &quot;Undamaged Noc Fang&quot;.  You have tell her the text 5 more times to obtain a total of 6 fangs, combine in the 6 slot container, then hand her the closed container.  Upon turning in the combined container named &quot;Closed Cloth Bag&quot;, she will give you the 3rd rune fragment.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone else as it took me a few minutes to figure it out with the text she responds with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We believe that she gives you this mini quest if you don't have faction.</div></div><hr />
