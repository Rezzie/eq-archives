Shapeshifting to Escape Movement-Impairing Effects – What Should Work and What Shouldn’t <br />
<br />
&quot;Many of you have expressed concern about the Shaman’s Frost Shock and the Mage’s frost spells. The slow effect remains on a Druid even after shapeshifting. This is not acting as intended and should be fixed in time. The Daze effect, however, is not meant to be removed by this act. The thought behind escaping through shapeshifting is that your physical form is difficult to hold through entangling. The philosophy is similar with polymorph in that the Druid has greater control over his physical form and cannot be transformed against his will when in animal form. Even with frost effects, you’re changing your shape and shaking off the frost clinging to you. Daze, however, exists to ensure there is some risk from running away -- it is a mechanic in place for balance reasons, and no class can dispel it. The effect is equivalent to a knock on the head and thus would not be dispelled by changing one’s form; it is a mental effect rather than a physical one. &quot;<br />

I'm going to keep spamming that every hour or so on the general board until Caydiem or somebody responds and tells us that its getting fixed. I am sick of dying to cheeze-shock when I'm not supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

Did they change the mage affect so that it was removed? seems strange to change one and keep the other. <br />

I'm horde so the only time i have to worry about it is in duels :D</div></div><hr />

&quot;This was on the Test Realm forum but I think it's drifted off into the annals of oblivion... <br />
<br />
We're aware that the fix for this is not yet in place, and it should come in a future patch. :) &quot;</div></div><hr />
