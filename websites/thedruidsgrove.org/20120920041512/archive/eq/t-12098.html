 <br />
I am lazy and I am not digging through my bar/book for Cloak of Nature ever again becuase someone can't invis themselves.<br />
 <br />
Gift of Mana? Awesome, very useful<br />
 <br />
Camo? Better becuase its less work on my part and makes my life easier.  Not as directly bennifical as Gift of Mana, but saves me a headache.<br />

<br />
Gift of Magic, at level 2, is already quite impressive, level 3 will definately be the next AA I buy. Convergance is pretty good too; Already saved a few groups with the instant 1500 I have at level 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say it's unfair to druids compare to rangers. Rangers get the group IC as well, also they get headshots up by 6 levels max'ed. Which means they are able to kill level 52 humanoids instantly. -- the counterpart for that should be our DC level. Why don't we get level 52 DC pets? rant :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">09-20-2005, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">xyu, the shared camo aa was given to the 2 classes that had innate camo in the class aa ability.  Necro, and SK got a different named aa that is the same effect as innate camo.  Clerics and maybe pallies, don't know for sure about pallies, got innate IVU, for whatever that is worth.<br />
 <br />
Comparing a hybrid and a priest aa's is comparing apples to oranges.  The fact that druids and rangers are similar in nature in the worship of either Tunare or Karana almost exclusively, and have so many common items but not everything is the same.  Just because some other class got ability ABC or upgrade to XXX does not mean that we druids should get the exact same ability ABC or upgrade to YYY that has absolutely nothing to do with XXX.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It's not so much laziness on my part as I just do not like the idea of having to mem a spell, cast it 5 times, then just hit innate camo for me as the group I am in is ready to move.  It is all about convience.  If you want, we can take out other convient abilities features just for you and go back to where evacuation spells only work when in dungeons.  You probably remember the old days of porting to Dreadlands, running to Karnor's to evac to EJ to head to Seb.  I sure don't miss that and it was because it was more convient.<br />
 <br />
If you do not like Group Camo, then the beauty of AA advancement, you don't have to get it.  Innate Camo is longer duration than fixed camo even comparing nonextended innate to fully extended CoN.  Thats an UPGRADE in my opinion and I enjoy it.  I use Innate Camo more than any other aa I ever purchased.  Now it works on my group.  That is helpful.  It does not mean I am just lazy.</div></div><hr />

I'd say in seconds and does not cost any mana. Can any druid kill a level 52 that fast, gets exp, and without using mana?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Why are you not complaining about rogues then?  Rogues have the assassinate ability that works just like headshot.  Rogues can now get that to kill a level 52.  OMG Rogues are better at killing things than druids now that are only level 52.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">09-20-2005, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok if level 52 is too low, how about level 55? Rangers can actually headshot a level 55 (6% chance). <br />
 <br />
Rogue assassination is even better than headshot (the former not restricted to humanoids), but more risky.</div></div><hr />

Did I bookmark the Ranger forums by mistake? <br />
<br />
Can we just skip the OMG Class XXX got something SO much better than us whine, it's really old. I'm glad other classes get AA's that are useful to them, I'm glad we got some that are useful to us.</div></div><hr />

Congratulations Adrius, you have turned a thread about a specific AA into the exact copy of the thread you already started.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">09-21-2005, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One BIG BIG reason the group camo is worth getting....it sticks on lower level chars than our fixed camo spell will affect.  I often am in guild groups helping people do loyalist faction the last week... I was so happy when i realized group camo stuck on everyone ).<br />
<br />
So its not just the lazy reason that this aa is better, it is actually a lot more flexible.  And now with the monster missions I expect that I will be grouping with lower level alts fairly often, so this will be even more important benefit.<br />
