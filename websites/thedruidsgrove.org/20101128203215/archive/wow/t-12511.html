<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arsaidh</div><div class="date">04-04-2008, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 70 hunter that I've played through endgame content both pre-BC and post-BC (TK and SSC, never made it to Hyjal or BT).  Because I took an enormous break and couldn't catch back up with my guild, plus I had really lost the desire for raiding, my hunter is retired to PvP and I am levelling a druid.<br />
<br />
My main desire is to heal.  I have a dps toon, and I love my hunter dearly, but I have always been fascinated by druids.  I love the caster aspect, and I want to &quot;grow&quot; her to heal both in PvE (raiding even maybe, but definitely 5 man) and PvP.  After just a couple of days work my baby droodad is level 23, with the full 5 piece &quot;Of the Fang&quot; set from Wailing Caverns. I am amazed at her versatility, and tend to be pretty &quot;shifty&quot; in my playstyle.  Starfire, Moonfire, Fairy Fire, kitty shift, claw claw, claw.. rip &lt;I usually never get the rip off, the mob dies too quickly&gt;.<br />
<br />
However, I am somewhat the laughing stock of my group of friends because they say levelling will go so much faster if I'm feral.  I'm promised that if I will only spec feral, I'll level in half the time.  Since I tend to be a pretty slow leveller anyway, that promise is appealing.  But I'll wind up speccing Resto at 60 when I hit outlands anyway, to heal my way to 70 by running 5 mans.  Is feral levelling really that much faster? Should I give up the &quot;Resto since Day One&quot; mantra and go for speed?</div></div><hr />

Moonkin doesn't really get nice gear until you start getting outland drops.  And Resto solo DPS is tough even when you reach lvl 70.<br />
<br />
So, your friends are probably right, but I'm sure someone has leveled Resto.  In fact, I think the author of www.resto4life.com did.  But she always had a group with her to help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took my shaman enhancement from 1 - 68 and went resto the rest of the way.  Don't regret it at all ( though with the +healing -&gt; +dmg change it might be easier to stay resto earlier, but killing is still slow until you have a good dmg set and a good healing set )</div></div><hr />

I tried it on Pookies for a while (b/c I had a group to roll with everyday), but soloing quests and solo farming became a huge burden and I respecced to feral before long.<br />
<br />
The great thing about pre-60 is that healing in Azeroth is such a joke you can easily do it feral specced.  Pookies healed every instance from WC to ST as feral, both with my regular group and also PUGs.<br />

GL with your droodle!</div></div><hr />

When they were not around I ended up pugging a lot of instances but you will get a lot of experience healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Solo'ing isn't really that bad as long as you remember to plan ahead on the healing and keep DPS/tank gear sets with you and use something like Outfitter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">06-04-2008, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Levelling resto is entertaining in some respects compared to a hunter or Feral Druid. lots of roots and running around rather than just standing there mashing buttons.<br />
<br />
I guess it depends what you want from your Druid. personally I just wanted to get it to 70 (ok, 68) as quickly as possible and, while I've had a play with Balance, Feral is imo easily the quickest and easiest way to level a druid.<br />
<br />
Where you will have an advantage is that I had no shortages of /w &quot;wanna run &lt;instance&gt;&quot; as a Druid as opposed to &quot;LFM NO HUNTERS!&quot; with the hunter.  So if you like instances you're quids in.</div></div><hr />

When I started my druid, I had contemplated making the long trip to 70 while focusing on the Restro tree.  Part of it is because I wanted to learn a healing class from the ground up.  <br />
<br />
Once level ten hit and I received my bear, I ended up sticking with feral and by the time I received cat form at 20, I was hooked.  The leveling speed of a Feral build is hands down the one of the top three in the game.<br />
<br />
With that being said, I made the switch at 60 since I wanted to prepare myself for healing at the higher levels.  Currently I am a 24 / 27 hybrid and I am loving it.<br />
<br />
If you are still thinking about leveling via Resto, here is a guide (http://www.resto4life.com/2008/01/19/talent-spec-leveling-restorationbalance/) from Restro4Life blog.  It is a mix of Resto and Balance.</div></div><hr />
