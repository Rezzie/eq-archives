 <br />
I'm not after PvP tactics, its more how the ranks work, what gear do you get and how do you get it? I presume that the titles like Private etc refer to the rank that you are but what equates to what?<br />
<br />
It's something I've debated doing but didn't want to look a right pratt by not having a clue!<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

In general, you gain rank by getting more honor than other players on your server, the higher the rank you want the more other players you have to get more honor than, until at rank 14 you get more honor than everyone else, good luck.</div></div><hr />

There's too many pvp rewards to list... and rember the rank armor is getting a slight make-over.<br />
<br />
In game, outside the horde officer quaters, there's a list of ranks/progression.  I'm assuming alliance have the same.<br />
<br />
Servers/factions are differnt for how they do things and how much honor it takes to rank up.  Your best bet is asking someone on your sever.</div></div><hr />
