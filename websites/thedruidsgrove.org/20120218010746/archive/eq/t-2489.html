Any thoughts, anyone ever done a study?  It may just be that I don't have down time medding for mana, I seem to be able to keep a constant flow of Goranga's.  Add a charmed wolf and I am pretty sure it is faster than quadding.<br />

But undoubtedly, quadding is quicker in ME. Of course, doing either of these PALES in comparison to charm soloing in ME.<br />
<br />
Find yourself a rav beast (about 1 in 4 are charmable using CoK) and buff him to the hilt (you want him staying alive). Give him two weaps (gnoll hide lariat and ykesha are good ones) and then go to town. Your exp will FLY like never before.<br />
<br />
Best spot to do this is in the hill/valley area just right of the building/zonein to Akheva. And now that everyone 60+ is in PoP, you should have little to no competition for pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You CANNOT ignore the benefit of free damage.  If a druid has the epic AND free drones, that's a LOT of free damage you can be doing.  Now, here's the catch:  you have to have a horse!  If you root the mobs in an area where lots of mobs path through, you can keep several cooking at all times, and hardly ever move!  That's medding all the time, even when you are casting all those free DoTs.  So, adds are your friend!<br />
<br />
If I have a bigger mana pool, or better mana regen, well then I can cast more WDs (in addition to the free DoTs), so I don't see how that tips the scales to quadding.<br />
<br />
I have done a good amount of quadding in ME, as well as multi-DoTing.  If you have all 3 (epic, free DoD, and horse), there's no way quadding is faster, IF you know where to set up camp.  If not, then quadding might be faster.<br />

<br />
why do you buff up your pet?  I feel that the hassle of buffing-hasting-etc (ie overhead) cost more then letting charm break, killing animal and charming a new one.  Is it because of the rarity of L52 rav beast that makes you want to hold on to that one?  I hate having charm break on a hasted-buffed pet =(  How hard do they hit?<br />
<br />
I have not used charm fighting in ME as of yet, but am quite familiar with charm-fighting and the general caveat is to break charm and kill lowered mob for the xp and get less overhead (mana usage) going.<br />
<br />

But, the lower level DoTs are much less mana efficient.  Better to just use free DoTs and WD (or BoR if evoc spec), and just have more rooted at once =)<br />

<br />
Parse the dps done by an unbuffed rav beast, and the dps of a rav beast with Savage Spirit, 2 weapons, and a Muzzel of Mardue.  You will have your answer.<br />
<br />
Also, the rarity of CoK-able Rav beasts does play a factor.  If you want a disposable pet, go with the lower level spec wolves.<br />

i know this has been rehashed before, it's self evident that a hasted-buffed-muzzled pet will do more DPS then a non-buffed one, but there was a post a while back about the &quot;overhead&quot; (buffing/healing pet) cost in mana of doing so versus simply charming and break/killing your pet and the xp efficiency of it.  For the 400 mana i use in TR to heal the pet, i could recharm 2 ravens.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, it was said that NOT buffing the pet was more mana/xp efficient.  I have read about the rarity of the Ravenous beast and it's &quot;lawnmover&quot; strength tho.<br />
<br />
Will go out and try it.<br />

<br />
Changes were: SCM1 and MC1 AAs, and the Coldain Military wristguard.<br />
<br />
With agressive multi-root/rotting, I can do about 29 mobs/hour at the toilers, and no better, 3 straight KEI sessions all wound up very close to this number.  Then I tried a massive quad session, rounding up adds, quadding til LOM, then rooting and free-rotting the leftovers til FM, and then loosening them with burst of flame to start quadding again.  Averaged almost 33 mobs per hour, and that was a first try, I think I can do better.  So it appears quadding is better than root-rotting.<br />
<br />
If I get an affliction efficiency item, that may tip the scales back to root/rot.  Will try to get one and test it =)<br />

The thing to remember about all recomdations on these boards is that some of the good xp is all situational.<br />

Some days the spot might not be open. Some days some idiots might be training alot. Other days the Range might just be out to get ya. The bext xp is either a fun group or a solo spot where you can continually pull and kill without interuptions. This is not always possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you read my post carefully, you would have seen that the numbers were obtained from many multiple-hour sessions.  So the time-cost of finding and rounding up mobs was included.  Obviously, this was for one camp (ME toiler hill area), and for my particular level, spells, and equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your conclusion? a diffrence of 4 mobs per hour? See that sounds about the same xp to me.<br />
It really just depends on your style.&quot;<br />
<br />
And some of us think an extra 14% XP/hour is a lot.  It's not the actual number of mobs difference (4 in this case), it's the percentage difference (33/29 = 1.1379, or 13.8% faster).<br />
<br />
I started this study with about 3 or 4 AAs, with a load of AAs that I wanted.  I wanted to see what would get me AAs the fastest.  At 13.8% more mobs per hour, an AA goes 12.1% faster (about 1/:cool: .  Seems like a significant difference to me =)<br />
<br />
Of course, the other funny thing about this is, my &quot;quadding&quot; example isn't really pure quadding.  I do root and free-DoT the ones left when I get LOM.  So it's really a hybrid.<br />

<br />
Yes, the reason not to kill your level 52 Rav beast is that it might take you an hour to find another one. Other druids may be using them or they just may not be up. Charming in situations where pets are not rare it makes total sense to kill off your pet rather than buffing it (e.g., Chardok). But in ME&lt; the charmable Ravs are way too rare. Not worth the hassle of losing your pet. Plus, gie it two proccing weaps and full buffs and it will be quadding for you. I think having a shammy along can increase efficiency due to slows.<br />
<br />
Anyway, charm soloing is awesome. Wish I could get a Command of Tunare already (<br />

I've mastered quadding frogs in PoS... I get 32% aa / kite<br />
Sure I need KEI to do so, and have SCM3 as well as 4th level crits... but you can't tell me doing root/dot is better then this<br />

It basically comes down to quading isn't much faster.  It can be a little faster, depending on how many adds you get, but if you get more than you can handle you have to run.  It's all about personal preferrence, and how things are layed out in the zone at the time.  If there are a lot of people around, then maybe quading isn't the best choice, as you are liable to have a whole zone petitioning that you keep pulling monsters over their heads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, I never said that.  When I made the first post, I had very little AA (no SCM and no SCF).  I would expect that with 4th level crits, quadding would work pretty well for you =)<br />
<br />
Each player has to evaluate their own situation based on level, spells, equipment, and AAs.<br />
<br />
I imagine a player with no SCF AAs, but with lots of good affliction focus items might have a different experience.<br />
<br />
And for where I'm at right now, the fastest XP is a hybrid.  I round up 9-10 mobs, and start quadding.  When LoM, I AoE root, and use my two free DoTs on the mobs while I med.  Once I hit about 80-85% mana, I use burst of flame to un-root whoever is still alive, and round up 9-10 more for quadding.<br />

So, given equivalent mana regen, a rotter who is never FM is maximizing his exp. The difference is small, however, so the ability to crit would easily tip the scales towards quadding.<br />
<br />
That's with equal regen. A horse makes a great, HUGE deal of difference to a rotter. Since the movement nerf, a quadder might as well be on foot.<br />
<br />
So essentially, a rotter has a much higher mana regen than a quadder, even if they're both capped on FT.<br />
<br />
I agree with Tatankawd, it depends on the particular Druid. An Evoc Druid w/crits will probably quad better. Since a large part of rotting is recasting root, an Alter Druid w/horse &amp; epic will probably see greater gains rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">12-23-2002, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I still think the fastest is the hybrid approach.  Your best efficiency mana-using spell is FoK, BY A MILE.  But, free DoTs are free DoTs =)  So quad til low on mana, and then root/rot the rest with free DoTs only.  When approaching 80-85% mana, start rounding up more.<br />
<br />
And regarding the horse, the hybrid approach still allows you the medding benefit while free-rotting during med time, and if you lead the mobs far enough while quadding, you will catch a med-tick while casting FoK.  If you look at a full cycle (from starting the roundup of mobs through quadding, through root-rotting the rest, and back to gathering), you are probably catching 60-70% of the ticks standing still, so getting the med benefit.  If just root-rotting, you still have to move once in a while to loot, or to go get more mobs if no wanderers come by to keep you busy. so you get the med benefit probably 80-90% of the time.  Not THAT big of a difference.<br />
<br />
As I said, for where I'm at, I max out at 29 mobs/hour (at toilers) just multi-dotting and using WD on the mobs, but can easily do 36 mobs/hour using the &quot;quad + free DoTs only&quot; approach.<br />
<br />
Relevant specs, for comparison:<br />
<br />
Level 60, 3650 mana pool (including KEI), epic, DoD bracer, MP3 focus item, EA3 focus item (WD and DoD get an extra tick), SCM1+2, MC1, FT1, PotG, MotH, horse with models off, Evoc specced.  I have no SCF AAs.<br />
<br />
Granted, quadding efficiency is much lower for Alter specced, and of course, the 3 or 4 Conjuration Druids in EQ do a LOT better root-rotting =)<br />
