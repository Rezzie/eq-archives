<br />
Fenier at least should be interested :)<br />
<br />
Spell tested:  Shaman lvl66 Crippling Spasm (-100 agi/dex/str)<br />
<br />
Mob:  A Lightning Diodite Staticfist (MPG) (same mob both parses)<br />
<br />
Parse 1:  No cripple<br />
Length - 13.3 minutes<br />
32 flurries (2.406 flurries/minute)<br />
<br />
Parse 2:  Crippled<br />
Length - 14.65 minutes<br />
28 flurries (1.911 flurries/minute)<br />
<br />
Difference:  ~26%.<br />
<br />
Short parses, aye  (How low is the confidence level, pls) I could only find an interested shammy w/ a little bit of time.  And my druid could only keep me up for 13.3 for the uncrippled parse.  But, I couldn't find this info anywhere else.<br />

Much thanks to Sabisback of Alliance Raiders on Luclin for volunteering his time to help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're a Beastlord.  Get a sizable sample (1-2k) hits keeping your spell incap on it the entire time.  This will at least provide a baseline on how it should act.  From there you can move on to Shaman / Chanter verisons to see how it scales.<br />
<br />
Hit graphs are important, you're not just looking at the flurry ratio.<br />

The attack debuffs also have a huge impact in ease of healing Khauruk...I was a believer after the first mob.  Now if only we could get a -100 chromatic -300ATK 2.25sec cast atk debuff for SoF!  I think it would be appropriate, frankly.<br />
<br />
It's something that I do want to work on more, but first I want to get a feel for what the -dex portion of the higher cripples does.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps I should try in WoS...I still get hit for max reasonably often, and druid should be able to keep me healed about indefinitely there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recommand parsing on a GoD Noc.  They rampage and hit for &lt;300, you can run a test on them nearly forever, even without the druid.<br />

<br />
I don't think you can assume cripple works the same on all mobs though.  I remember cripple used to significantly (visibly) reduce rampage/flurry on some old raid targets but not on others.</div></div><hr />
