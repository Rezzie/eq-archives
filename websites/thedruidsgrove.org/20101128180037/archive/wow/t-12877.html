I can 10 man my way all the way through LK without having to deal with screaming, militant, min-maxing idiot guild leaders in giant e-peen guilds.  Blizz just guaranteed themselves a loyal customer as far as I am concerned.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The main reason for guilds breaking up is not being able to mount 25-mans (or 40-mans, back in the day) - this should make the game more fun for a lot of people. No longer will you have to decide whether to stay in the guild where all your friends are or to join that drama ridden elite-raiding guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If LK had not been announced when it had, I probably would have quit WoW for that reason.  We can rarely get 25 people together to raid, and after doing some runs with a couple of elite guilds, there was no way I was going to pay $15 a month for that experience.<br />
<br />
After a couple runs I knew the elite guild scene was not for me.  Being told how to spec and how to play, having required raiding hours per week equal to a second job and listening to people get sceamed at and insulted for making a mistake isn't for me.  Thank God it wasn't me getting yelled at, the RL wouldn't have enjoyed the response he got.<br />
<br />
We tend to laugh our way through raids, I enjoy that atmosphere alot more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is just a little side note, that might be useful for those of you out there that are raid or guild leaders.   Fun and useful ways to motivate your raid and have fun at the same time.<br />
<br />
We instituted the &quot;Shining Star vs Nipple of Shame&quot; policy with our progressive raids.  How it works is during the raid when someone makes a bone headed move, they are awarded the &quot;Nipple of Shame&quot; [raid mark circle] (and mocked/ridiculed, in good fun of course)  While the ribbing is pretty common in our group it intensifies when you are the lucky winner of this prestigious award.  <br />
<br />
In contrary to the &quot;Nipple of Shame&quot; we apply the &quot;Shinning Star&quot; to a raid member and publicly praise them for an excellent out of the ordinary move or save.  They too are likely to be ridiculed, but again in good taste.<br />
<br />
At the end of the raid, the last one to own the &quot;NoS&quot; owes the guild bank 10g, and the &quot;SS&quot; gets 10g.  If either one or the other fails to materialize the gbank picks up the cost or reward.  <br />
<br />
The point is that we have fun, no one is insulted, and you still can talk about mistakes and award awesome saves without having that &quot;military&quot; feel.  It helps to make constructive critisism feel more &quot;constructive&quot;.</div></div><hr />
