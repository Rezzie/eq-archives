The AOE power of h00tkins in the beta is just insane.  Without a doubt the coolest looking spell in any game, ever, like ever.<br />

Maybe he wasnt in +dmg gear, or didnt train anything past rank 1... but the 50 - 125 damage numbers were underwhelming.<br />
 <br />
Definitley an amazing looking spell tho.  Is there any limit on the number of mobs that it can damage at the same time?</div></div><hr />

They just recently added the additional ranks of Starfall, so the version in that video was probably rank 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">08-12-2008, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well if you read the description of Starfall each star hits for like 100-160 or so.  Then it hits each nearby target for 20 damage.  Now so if you have 10 targets I think each one might take the 100 and then each near by one gets 20 from their nearby partners... So the streams of small numbers were probably the extra scatter damage<br />
<br />
Well all I have to say is it could scale well... it certainly sounds like it could hit pretty hard with multiple ranks and all that extra &quot;scatter damage&quot;.  Ok based on the video it looks like the initial person eats the heavy hit and everyone else just gets this constant stream of &quot;scatter&quot; hits.  Either way in large groups it could be pretty hefty damage.  So the more mobs the more damage you'd dish out.  Its not channeled so you should be able to starfall and stack a hurricane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-13-2008, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it certainly looks good and is a nice addition to a oomkin ability.<br />
<br />
see a lot of oomkins running around now although i have to admit i've never actually grouped with one as i only run heroics.  so no idea how good they are or can be with good gear.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">08-13-2008, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boomkin have tremendous damage potential if they are spec'd right and have the right gear.  Their main issues are:<br />
1.  Threat -&gt; Even with their threat reducing talents they generate BOATLOADs of threat.  Currently I haven't met a tank I can't match for TPS even with salvation, but that means I need to give them a bigger head start.<br />
2.  They can't get hung up on only wearing leather.  Boomkin can do amazing damage with cloth gear... stats&gt;leather<br />
<br />
The other reason boomkin are nice is that they amp the hell out of your other ranged caster dps.  5-6% crit is just amazing.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I'd be really interested to see the +spell dmg coefficient for starfall, and to figure out if it is capped (like a warlock's Seed of Corruption - can never do more than a set amount of dmg).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-14-2008, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well how funny that i posted yesterday morning i'd never run a heroic with an ooomkin and then last nite 4 of us spent over 30 mins trying to find a 5th for a run to heroic mech.<br />
<br />
who pops up but some oomkin.<br />
<br />
i took a look at his gear and was concerned.  he had a number of greens and basically all blues.  none of which were enchanted with anything, even a basic armour patch. he did have a pvp helm that had no meta gem in it though!<br />
<br />
i think his +damage was about 650. and he had around 8k hp and 8k mana.<br />
<br />
running it with him i was surprised how much damage he did and yes he did generate a ton of threat on omen as well.<br />
<br />
so i can imagine a good geared raiding oomkin to put out some great dps/damage figures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">08-14-2008, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I ran on Tuesday as basically the &quot;under geared&quot; alt in Kara.  I was running with fully T5 equipped people and I kept pace.  They were doing about 1kDPS and I was pushing 750-800 DPS on bosses.  And I was having WAY more threat issues than the guys pushing 1000 DPS.</div></div><hr />
