 <br />
I just rolled another druid, Night Elf this time. What gear do you suggest for a young druid?<br />
 <br />
Mind, I'm only asking about lower levels. He's 12 atm, but only thinking ahead to level 25 or so. I really enjoy playing low level characters for PvE.<br />
 <br />
I don't have access to any enchants or armor kits, unless I start LW. I am putting all my talent points into Feral. Should I concentrate on AGI, or balance STA and AGI? I'm thinking of like green &quot;of the monkey&quot; or whatnot gear.</div></div><hr />

Now don't ignore agility, but agility and strength are most important.  Until you get to Outland and get into a zone where itemization is better, you pretty much have to follow the &quot;take what you can get&quot; theory.  Most of the gear pre BC is not well itemized for Feral Druids in leather.  Agility is your key for critical strikes.  Its invaluable, but without strength, you're critical might be half of what it would be with a decent amount of strength.  Your weapons don't affect your damage in feral form.  So the only way to bump your damage is to up your strength.</div></div><hr />

Leggings of the fang, from WC<br />
Tunic of westfall from a q in DM<br />
and Smite's Mighty Hammer also from dm.<br />
This gear should benefit you very much at the start  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agility only comes into play after a certain amount of attack power.<br />
<br />
Get as much str as you can atm and it will make leveling easier.</div></div><hr />

AGI becomes more valuable to your AP starting at 1200AP which is when 1 point of AGI is equal to 1 point of STR in terms of AP.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it's true. Emarr born and raised. But I was stationed in South Korea for most of my time playing. So, I hooked up with the Aussie's. Was in Order of Magus Tytalus, Hearts of Fenris then Cruentus, and then joined Whit's End when I hit the states again.<br />
 <br />
Now I transferred over to Saryrn to join a guild that fits my West Coast schedule. I play WoW while I raid. =)</div></div><hr />
