I have a lvl 41 druid and have divided my talent points between feral and restoration.  Is this a good idea or should I concentrate all my talent points in one area?  I want to function mostly as a healer in groups.  When alone, I mostly use feral forms.</div></div><hr />

Enjoy feral!<br />
<br />
ps. If you start casting your heals and anticipate the damage your target will take you can solo heal fine for some of the easier instances.</div></div><hr />

We can minimize the impact of &quot;spike&quot; damage better than anyother healing class. If you anticipate and put up some HoT's early, the healing job will be significantly easier. As a feral your HT isn't gonna be as effective so you'll want to comp with those HoT's more often.</div></div><hr />

I researched prior to choosing my first WOW character, and I am so glad I chose a druid.  I have done a lot of self-healing.  Sorry, but don't know all the lingo yet.  What is HoT's?</div></div><hr />

Rest is just whining druids who only lived through the luxury times and can't take a challenge and other classes who come there to post how OP we were.</div></div><hr />

 You said it and that goes for any of the class forums. Going there for information is such a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elymanrock</div><div class="date">03-18-2007, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going feral is like choosing to go on a pub crawl instead of a wine and cheese everning. As a feral you apply ur skills to a whole, casting to pull, Heal over times pre-getting smacked, stealthy damage, avoiding agro and smacking 3 around roaring your head being Jake the Muss (go see Once Were Warriors).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grubluv</div><div class="date">03-26-2007, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should be able to heal anything with the common 30/N (where N increases as you level) healing touch spec. That is to say, pick up the basics from the healing tree (naturalist, intensity, etc), the talents that improve your healing touch, and subtlety. Be sure to pre-cast healing touch and cancel the heal if it isn't needed. Never cast regrowth unless you feel it is necessary to save a life. Always cast barkskin before using tranquillity.<br />
<br />
The only problem with this specification is tanking. We have mangle and lacerate to generate threat. You won't have mangle, and you won't receive lacerate until level 66. Tanking in those late 50's / early 60's will be a lot harder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-26-2007, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Use leveling to find out what it is you enjoy most about being a druid.  For many it is the jack of all trades.  For some it is our healing and they choose to specialize in that.  Others choose feral and even some moonkin.  Regardless of which you choose, don't forget your other forms, they are all there for particular situations.<br />
<br />
In terms of healing, I am all out heal bot now.  56 pts in resto and I really don't regret it in the slighest.  We are hard to touch in terms of our healing especially on damage that is spread across multiple targets.  My gf as a priest loves running heroics with me since she can watch for large spike damage and I can mitigate most anything else.  Makes most heroics quite doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobull</div><div class="date">03-26-2007, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To help anticipate and make sure you cast the most effective HoT, try out the Healbot add-on.  I always heal with it in 5-mans.  Had to do it recently without it and it was a complete mess!  Trust me, your party will thank you for those HoT's timed correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">04-04-2007, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As many have said before dont let people type cast you. No matter what talents you take dont ever forget you have those forms buttons.  Nothing is worse then seeing a druid that does not take advantage of thier other forms.  Get to know what each of your abilities do and how they will affect your party members.  Some times it only takes a small change in your normal mode of operation to make the dynamics of your group go from maginal to exceptional.<br />
<br />
Last of all always keep two sets of armor with you at all times.  You will need a Healing Set and a Feral Set.  You never know when you will need to change druid mode to help out when DPS, TANK, or HEAL mode will be needed.  Though Feral Gear comes in two flavors DPS &amp; TANK normallly you can combine the two in if your not talent Speced for Feral.</div></div><hr />
