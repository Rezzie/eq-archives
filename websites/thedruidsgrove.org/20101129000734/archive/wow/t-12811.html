<br />
I has good news.  My guild's main raid leader, who knows the game inside and out, has made a very firm prediction (and provided evidence to back it up) that Moonkin will be the single most important dps class to have in a raid in WotLK - he has basically said that .every.raid. will need to have at least 1 moonkin in it.<br />
<br />
What with Starfall and a host of other really cool new h00t talents, it looks like there are going to be a lot more feathery druids about soon :&gt;<br />

<br />
resto i dont want to ever be again having been forced to be resto rep bc when i did the 40 man raids.<br />
<br />
i'll certainly be looking to put together some oomkin gear whilst levelling towards 80 and may give it a try as a levelling spec in WotLK ?<br />
<br />
we've had the same oomkin with us 3 times recently in heroics and despite mainly having blues with the odd purple and a green or 2 he can seemingly keep up with much better epic geared people !</div></div><hr />

BUT!!!! if I were to hazard a guess.... Boomkin will share itemization with druid healers.... Soo.... in theory you could get a jump start by stacking healing gear... however I'm not sure where their spell crit will come from unless lifebloom and other HoTs will crit now too....</div></div><hr />

I just remember WC3 and having the Priestess of the Moon drop Starfall hell on armies and it was awesome.  :O~</div></div><hr />

<br />
not a lot is the answer !<br />
<br />
i can get o +400 damage :(  although a few items need gems so i can increase that a bit.<br />
<br />
i'm also down on spirit which i assume is needed for oomkin?<br />
<br />
quick question as can't see a thread or link anywhere.....is there a good site for trainee oomkins along with basic info on talent build ?</div></div><hr />

I never looked specifically for +spirit stuff as a moonkin, I would just focus on +intel as that also gives you +damage.<br />
<br />
If you're looking to switch to moonkin for solo quests and stuff, remember that you have your innervate that restores your mana over time (though its a six min cooldown). I never had mana issues leveling back then. I think I would pull with starfire, root, insect swarm and moonfirex1 wrath until dead. That gave me at least 6-7 kills before I needed to innervate or drink..<br />
<br />
Raiding moonkin have more mana issues just to the duration of boss fights, so ask to group with shadow priests if possible (they wont mind due to the +crit you'll bring the group)<br />
<br />
Priest mp5, spirit trinkets alway help if you're damage is good enough<br />
<br />
hope that helps (I think I went a bit off topic, sorry)  :-)<br />
