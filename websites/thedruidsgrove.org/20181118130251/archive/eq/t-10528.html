I tried to kill the Fierce Turpta in Natimbi.......I charmed a regular Turpta.....I had him attack and I kept nuking the Fierce one. Well my charmed Turpta was killed by the Fierce one and then I got summoned and killed. This happened 4 times last night (thank goodness for Cleric rez's).<br />
How do I escape a MOB that summons?<br />
How do i fight one.....any good methods?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way that I used to kill the corrupted elysian in UP (another mob that summons) was getting him snared, rooted, myself with as much regen as possible. I tossed Winged Death on him ran oor, timed his summons and made sure I was moving away from him when he summoned, that way I was only hit once maybe twice each summoning cycle.<br />
<br />
I always got a thrill fighting summoning mobs, and I usually found a way, either going high on DS and channeling heals on myself while the mob beat itself to death, or the run and dot way. I always found that nuking was to mana inefficient to do. Later on (after CoT) I have used charmed mobs, but then I had exodus in case the s*** hit the fan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Method 1:  Charm a pet with a lot of HP (DC pets usually will not work) and keep the pet healed and charmed during the entire fight.  If charm breaks, evac and try again.  Make sure you do not out damage your pet or you will be summoned.   Do not use this method on mobs that dispel or agro-wipe themselves.  Exodus is almost a requirement for this method.<br />
<br />
Method 2:  Get all the HP buffs you can find (symbol, focus, ect) and all the regen as possible.  Put your best DS on yourself, attack the mob and hope you can channel enough heals thru the attacks to stay alive.  Make sure you do at least 1 point of melee/spell damage to the mob or it will not leave a corpse (DS damage is considered environmental damage).  Spell casting haste (cleric buff, AA, or item) helps.  Exodus is useful for this method.  You may want to use Virtue/Conviction instead of  your skin spells.</div></div><hr />

Cast a DoT or 2 on the MOB then let your pet do the rest. Wildroot's explanation is another way when you have no pet...but you being level 56 and the baddies hit a bit hard in GoD, I would try to keep the pet alive. Also invest AA's in exodus and as soon as your pet dies hit the button. The comfort you feel knowing that you can instant exo if something goes wrong is very much worth it. Have fun :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kunark/Velious level 200-400 hitters (generally dragons that require belly casting), max regen/ds, open with hand of ro or dispel, land a couple of my largest dots, and nuke til I have to heal myself.  The higher level giants in Kael tend to be in this category, however, Kael has awesome pets to charm (~300-350 dps, 15k hp) so I use them instead.<br />
<br />
Anything less than that is a joke.</div></div><hr />

That's one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do Ro/Eci's debuffs really make much of a noticeable difference?  I usually only load it when the creature is being tanked or when I'm kiting with the matching nuke spell type.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have a minute or two and you know you won't get KS'd, hit yourself with the Nature's Recovery heal over time spell.  thats an extra (30?) HP per tick and the three minute duration is usually enough to alst you for the kill.  Carry shaman potions for the extra DS too, like soandso's Skin of Flame or Blistering Flesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">InTenSity</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind he is 56, so that means he can't have exodus yet, guessing about 4k hp max buffed, maybe 4k mana.  No cheal yet, but does have tunare's request?  whichever allows you to charm up to level 55 or so.  That being said, there are a few ways to go about this.  Buff your pet, make sure it is snared, DS, and regen on the pet, do NOT forget to haste your pet!  If you have some crappy weapons, like fine steel or something laying around, give those to your pet.  <br />
<br />
I know nothing about the mob you want to fight, my best guess is that you need to try to start out with a root, you have until 96% dmg done until they start summoning, most of the time.  Root and then snare, or snare and then root, either way, hope either one isn't resisted.  At this point if you are not being summoned, I would recommend putting a small dot on the mob, that way you do your 1pt of dmg or whatever is needed.  Send in the pet and just start blasting it with chloro, or whatever spell it is you have, maybe superior healing?  <br />
<br />
Hope that you can keep the pet up longer than it takes your pet to kill the mob.  If you are dying in 2 or 3 rounds to whatever mob you are trying to kill, come back when you are 58 and can cheal.  <br />
<br />
One last trick, if you are close and can take 5 or 6 rounds of dmg, you may want to run in before your pet dies and start taking the dmg, mob will switch from hating your pet, to hating the owner just by proximity.<br />
<br />
Best of luck to ya!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, good point.<br />
<br />
If you know ahead of time that you're going to rely on a pet, have a high level Magician summon some pet toys for you.  I know the summoned bear pet can dual wield, and I think mobs mobs over level 29 can.  Have a mage summon a muzzle, girdle, and two weapons.  All together these will make an amazing boost in your pets survival and damage.<br />
<br />
For instance, when my shadow knight got her first pet, I was hitting harder than little old Kebober.  WHen I gave him a mage weapon, he was outdamaging me by far!  The pet toys are awesome to have if you know you're going to be using your pet.<br />
<br />
56?  Okay.  If you have a decent amount of hit points, you can tank (kinda) while your pet wails on the creature.  Just keep healing yourself.  You might be better off letting the pet tank, though.  Charm, Buff the pet (Skin, Strength, Regen, Damage Shield, Savage Spirit).  When you pull your pet to charm, you might want to pull with Glamour of Tunare (can't remember if you have it yet...) to lower the animal's resist magic.  Otherwise, no biggie.  Give the pet the mage toys and then go town.<br />
<br />
I'd pull the named with snare or dispel, then root it, then cast the debuff (not dispel) on it... Finally, throw in a DoT (two if you have time and don't get summoned) and then send in the pet.  be ready to heal the pet, and you might get summoned once or twice before the pet builds up aggro.  If the fit hits the shan, punch Exodus (yes, punch your keyboard, it will relieve some stress!) or cast Egress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
myself i dire charm a hynid, ds regen hps haste buff it, send it in and start dotting or nuking it to death doesnt take long unless i have to spam heal the pet. i would suggest getting spell casting mastery 3 to save mana on heals.<br />
<br />
an alternate way would be if its getting low on health and your pet dies try dotting or nuking it to death and runing away from it after each summons, i would suggest an affliction haste and affliction effiiciency items and extended range item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iilane SalAlur</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a druid, there is one main strategy I use for dealing with summoners. I personally prefer this strategy against summoning mobs as well as in duels against strong meleeing classes. (There is one other strategy for dealing with summoners, but it is inherently extremely unreliable) <br />
<br />
1. Always have an exit strategy. With summoning mobs, you can't run away so this has to be either a succor, evac or gate spell. Have one memorized as a last resort, this is your one and only lifeline. <br />
<br />
2. Buffs. Apply your best AC, HP, DS and regen buffs. DS is important as an additional source of free damage. I personally use three items - Regal Band of Bathezid (Chardok quest item), Velium Coldain Insigna Ring (8th Coldain quest ring) and smithed Humming Orbs that give me a combined DS of 45.Together with our two DS spells, I get to deal close to 100 damage every time I am hit. <br />
<br />
3. Root. I can't describe how important for a summoner to be rooted. It is what gives us druids breathing room to cast spells safely by simply stepping back. Always reapply root when it breaks. <br />
<br />
4. Debuffs and dispells. Once your target is rooted, anything that can reduce your target's meleeing dps is always good. 99% of summoners do not start summoning until they are damaged a little so ALWAYS start with these spells. Once your target is sufficiently debuffed, go on to the next phase. <br />
<br />
5. Apply DoTs. Like DS, DoTs are a good source of additional damage. Always start with your longest casting and most damaging DoT (For me its either epic 1.0 or Blade of the Tempest). You will only have a small window of a few seconds before the mob starts summoning. Usually, I would try to squeeze into this small window the most damaging combo of DoTs that I can cast.   <br />
<br />
6. Melee, Nuke, Heal. Once the mob starts summoning, I stop using DoTs as its time to ramp up the dps. I turn on auto attack (for an extra source of damage) and start nuking away. Every time the mob summons me, I step back out of melee range and nuke again, or if I'm low on hp I heal myself. I usually won't bother to refresh my DoTs or DS unless they are insta-click or very quick casting. Rinse and repeat until either your mob is dead or you are dead (or escaped). <br />
<br />
Now, for the inherently extremely unreliable second strategy - using a pet as tank and damage dealer. You will only want to use this strategy when the first strategy fails - usually because the summoning mob has very very high dps that your own druid health bar cannot withstand more than 10 seconds. As with the first strategy, always plan an exit strategy. Now find a suitable pet, make sure you have snared and glamored it before casting charm. Now buff the pet with AC, hp, DS, regen buffs. Your pet will be the main tank and damage dealer, so root the summoner and order your pet to attack it. It is vital to always 1) Keep your pet alive 2) Keep your pet charmed and 3) Keep the summoner rooted. <br />
<br />
Using a pet introduces two uncontrollable random factors, charm breaks and root breaks. If root breaks, reapply the root. If either charm breaks, you will get summoned. Take a step back and try to recharm your pet. Its difficult with all that interrupting but still doable. Here's the catch, its very common to have both charm and root broken at the same time. To begin with, our charm spells are inherently unstable and breaks often even with a -MR debuff applied on the pet. Secondly, since the pet is meleeing the summoner to deal damage and aggro, it will cause root breaks to occur pretty often too. And if BOTH spell are down at the same time, you will be in deep deep trouble. You will have two mobs hitting on you, one of the mobs (or possibly even BOTH mobs) will summon you and at least one mob will be one that can kill you in under 10 seconds. All I can say is cast evac, and pray.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get your buffs on first, don't forget regen/ds. <br />
<br />
Then get a pet. Make sure pet is glamoured/snared, charm him and skin/ds/haste him. Don't waste time here, charm doesn't last forever (/wink). <br />
<br />
Root/snare your mob! <br />
<br />
As Iilane says above, &quot;It is vital to always 1) Keep your pet alive 2) Keep your pet charmed and 3) Keep the summoner rooted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Debuff mob, heal your pet, heal your pet, nuke when you can, and don't forget to heal your pet. Losing to charm break is bad luck, but losing to pet dying is usually all you. Burn the mob when you can, less time you fight it the better. Do your damage fast. Hold your breath while doing this, it makes charm last longer. <br />
<br />
Hotkey root and charm if you haven't.<br />
<br />
If pet dies or breaks charm, exo or run like the wind, go back and try again (don't forget to mem egress this time). If your mob is rooted you may be able to step back and recharm if you're quick. Channelling thru mob hits + pet hits could get nasty. <br />
<br />
Depending on the mob and your hp/defensive abilities, you might be able to channel and finish off the mob while he's beating the crap out of you. At that time I couldn't stand up to giants melee, so exo was my option when charm failed.<br />
<br />
Killing summoners adds a different dimension to solo-ing..need to be on your toes and have a solid When-All-Hell-Breaks-Loose Back Up Plan. Fun stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeeber</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things to know on summoning mobs:<br />
 <br />
-When a mob summons, it instantly warps whatever PC or NPC is at the top of their aggro list to the center of its melee range.<br />
-A mob will ONLY summon once it goes under 97% health. To clarify, at 97% health, a mob will not summon, and at 96% health, it will. This is not a permanent status; if the mob goes down to 96% and starts summoning, but then regenerates or is healed back up past 97%, it will stop summoning.<br />
-All mobs refresh summon on a TWELVE (12) second counter. To clarify, a mob will summon, and after 12 seconds, it will summon again.<br />
-As long as its target is in its melee range, the mob will not summon. The 12 second counter will reach 12 and stop, and will not begin again until it switches aggro to summon another target or its current target reaches the edge of the mob's melee range.<br />
-Summoning mobs that also cast: A mob will not summon at any time while it casts a spell. Casting a spell will not stop or reset the mob's 12 second counter, but if it reaches 12 in the middle of casting a spell, it will delay summoning its target until it finishes casting.<br />
-When you are summoned, any spell you were in the middle of casting will be interrupted.<br />
-When you are summoned, you retain your facing. To clarify, if you are facing north, and a mob directly to your east summons you, you will have moved a distance to your east, but you will still be facing to your north (this all sounds like complicated physics or something, but it's important to remember).<br />
-If a mob is feared/blinded/low-health-running, it will not summon. The 12 second counter will reach 12 and stop during that time.<br />
 <br />
Keep that in mind any time you deal with a summoning mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iilane SalAlur</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">-If a mob is feared/blinded/low-health-running, it will not summon. The 12 second counter will reach 12 and stop during that time.<br />
<br />
I learn something new everyday. Hmm.. we have a level 24 spell, Sunbeam, that causes blindness for 3 ticks. Doesn't this mean that if I recast Sunbeam every 18 seconds, the mob it would never summon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all mobs are 12 second summoners.  66+ mobs that summon seem to all be 4 second summoners, as is Gryme the Crypt Guardian in PoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeeber</div><div class="date">01-08-2005, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hum, 4 second summoners, didn't know about that. I've encountered summoning mobs from every expansion, and the 12 second counter seems to apply for all of them. Course, I'm 63, too. That must me something with 66+, ya.<br />
 <br />
Anyways, if you chain casted Sunbeam on the mob, it would never summon, yes...but remember that blind has some catches too. It won't work if the mob is rooted...it'll still summon. It usually won't last for 18 seconds, and if you come within the mob's melee range, it'll still attack you. From my experience, it's just not efficient enough to chain cast the spell...once it wears off, you get summoned, and in most cases the only way to reassume a casting position is to keep the mob rooted, upon which blind won't work and it'll still summon. And if you stayed in the mob's melee range and casted blind...Sunbeam is an AE spell, you you'd run the risk of blinding yourself too. Good/bad thing about Sunbeam, too, is that it sticks alot.<br />
 <br />
But it's not entirely out of the question. I used sunbeam to kite Aerin-Dar in PoV down to 96% once... then I got summoned and died...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">01-09-2005, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you can just kite Aerin Dar without sunbeam down to 96% til you get summoned -_-  And even if sunbeam does somehow keep him from summoning, at 90% you get raped by an add! Yay!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">01-10-2005, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The root dot method works quite wel on a variety of summoners.  I used it on the corrupt elysian in UP, and fine tuned the method a lot in CT.  It works very well on a lot of the OOW mobs now too.<br />
<br />
In general this is my root rot plan:<br />
<br />
Root mob (have clicky pants, so its mana free and has neg resist modifier)<br />
<br />
Snare mob<br />
<br />
Use two debuffs, ro's etc.  Lowering the mobs ac, fire resist and attk all help.  The attk part can sometimes be really critical-- or it may not matter, depends on a lot of variables.  The main thing is it cant hurt, mob isnt damaged as of yet and isnt summoning.<br />
<br />
Apply epic.  Its a slow dot so it wont tend to start the summon cycle any sooner, and its damage will add up over the fight.<br />
<br />
Apply first dot...use one with a fire debuff usually, just to make the good fire dot stick better.<br />
<br />
Apply good fire dot.<br />
<br />
At this point you may get summoned....or you may have time to sneak in a wasp type dot.  You will have to learn to judge this.  Spell haste helps, dot crits etc make this less likely.<br />
<br />
Get summoned....run out of range asap, stop, partially turn to make sure casting wont be interrupted, cast second (or first) wasp dot.<br />
<br />
At this point you just reapply dots and heal self as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Things that can help:<br />
<br />
Already be running when summoned- cant always do this, but it will cut down on the hits the mob gets in.<br />
<br />
Be ready to reapply root if/ when it breaks.  Duck out of a dot cast if need be of course.<br />
<br />
SOTW makes a nice safety net...dont wait too long to use it tho.<br />
<br />
As much DS as you can get and regen help too.<br />
<br />
You dont have to have exodus to lave, egress usually will work fine if you dont leave it until the last second.<br />
