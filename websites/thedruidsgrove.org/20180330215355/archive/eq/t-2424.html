I have been killing Kizdeen and doing the Jaggedpine quest for a week now.  4-5 hours a day and I still can not get out of dubious.  Am I doing something wrong?  Is the faction bugged.  Please help</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to kill Kiz for about 2 days to get enough KoA faction for Niola to start taking my batwings for positive  faction hits so that I could continue with my epic. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hand the bat wings to her so you have an open trade window but dont trade...let your friend invis you and then trade...do that until your indifferent. <br />
<br />
Well hopefully that still works and they havent nerfed it thats how I fixed it.<br />

<br />
Make sure the trade window is open, get invised, then trade.<br />
<br />
Bring plenty of batwings.  I believe at apprehensive or indifferent, you can hand in the wings without the invis.</div></div><hr />

I remember I got my Druids faction up by doing that just in time before they put a patch out sayin they &quot;fixed&quot; it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, if you can racially hide you don't even NEED a friend to invis you with the new UI.<br />
<br />
hand thing npc.<br />
<br />
hit your hide hot button until npc indiff.<br />
<br />
complete trade.<br />
<br />
What they fixed was being invis and INNITIATING a trade or something. You always become visible now upon placing a thing on an npc, no matter how you do it; you can still hide or get invised while its IN the trading window.</div></div><hr />

What a pain.<br />
<br />
She lubs me now tho.</div></div><hr />

But the Racial hide never worked for me.  Problem is the hide itself may have failed.</div></div><hr />
