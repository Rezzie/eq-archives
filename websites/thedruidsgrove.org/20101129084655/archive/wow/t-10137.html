I have been doing a bunch of the cenarion circle/twilight quests and stuff in silithus.  I also have tons of the twilight 3-piece clothing drops used to summon the elemental avatars at the lesser wind stones.  This works out well as it provides good filler time when I only have grind time but don't have group or raid time.<br />
<br />
The problem is that although the twilight mobs go down very easily, I can't seem to solo the summoned avatars.<br />
<br />
Has anyone had any success soloing these level 60 elites with their druids?  I have a rogue friend who can do it handily but he uses a lot of stuns.<br />
<br />
One of the problems is that the avatar melee hits do only magic damage and therefore bypass my bear armor.  I'm specced 0/30/21 so normally fight elites in bear form and shift out to heal (NS or otherwise).  <br />
<br />
So if anyone has experience soloing these avatars please give me information on what you are doing.  I haven't tried rooting and kiting, but normally with my current spec my mana won't last long enough to take down a lvl 60 elite doing that.<br />
<br />
thx</div></div><hr />

<br />
Team up with a hunter or mage.  Play healer.  They are fairly trivial that way.<br />
<br />
The only classes I've seen able to consistently solo these are hunters and paladins.</div></div><hr />

To me the real risk was adds more then the elemental fights themselves... a couple of those summoning stones are in the direct path of the Prophet and her cronies.<br />
<br />
I start off by clearing my area... including scorpions/worms in some spots.  Fire/Earth have a knock back, so I usually use one of the rock clusters and back into that... it's also fun to use feral charge in mid-air if your not backed into a rock... but if your 'learning' I'd use the rock.<br />
<br />
So for the fights, I'd start off in Bear and use Feral Bash for my first heal.  Then back to bear for a Feral Regen as my second heal... this is where it gets 'up to you'.  Orginally I stayed Bear the entire fight... after I got used to it and realized I was mainly dealing with Resists, not AC I started using Cat more for the finish/NS heal phase (earth stay in bear since that is an AC fight).  Sometimes I'll have to work in another heal and if bash isn't refreshed.. the second they root me I shift out and regrowth.<br />
<br />
Adds are really where innervate comes into play... the Prophet is an immediate loss... but scorps/cultists/worms can be dealt with.  I prefer to just Bear'm, someone with NG might use that... it seems staying in caster and hibernating/rooting is a greater risk then just innervate and ignore'n as long as the templar is still up.</div></div><hr />
