<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaitan22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's some good spots in elemental planes for a chanter/druid duo?  We occassionally add others to our groups, but rarely tanks :P  Especially wondering about PoFire, as we'd heard there is the best exp zone.  Is there a good camp spot and CoD/CoT charmable mobs in Fire?  We prefer pet tanking/dd, but are used to aggro kiting as well.  Just recently gotten all EP zone access, and haven't had any time to explore them outside of raids :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Woodix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to 2nd castle in PoFire, nearby pic nick table, they dont summon, snare one and go up to the ramps straight to FR spot, you can aggo kit, that's the more safe spot in solo / duo i guess.<br />
<br />
You can duo with a slower in any others zones but PoAir, they all summon, but we done it with a shamy friend, was quite fun and not that hard once you manage well with your friend ) Not truly good xp, but can be a good way for example to get &quot;living fragment of ...&quot; for the bindden correnptia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea as Woodix said that is a good spot to duo. Other spot would be the bird prep spot in Fire when birds are not up. can kite mobs in a circle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is no safe CoD/CoT duo'ing in the elemental planes.  Mobs hit to hard.<br />
<br />
Best thing a druid/chanter can do duo'ing is quadkite at the fennin trigger picnic tables.  The chanter AE Tashing will improve your damage from nukes and their mana will allow you to finish off the stubborn mob or two in the quadkite.<br />
<br />
Be sure and spend the 180p on the appropriate shaman focus potion too.  Since you don't plan on dying and druids are mana intensive, every percentage saved helps.<br />
<br />
One diamond drop and the potions paid for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MellenFC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">in fire to the left of the gy (facing out towards the forrest area) is a spot for charming.  There's enough room to kite, nothing paths close enough to add and it's not in the immediate area of the zone in/out but still fairly close if needed.  <br />
<br />
Think all the mobs in the first area that aren't names should be chanter charmable.  The horses I think are undead so I think necro charmable and spiders are animals (o.0) but of course too high for driud charm =p  Some randomly are not root or snarable.</div></div><hr />
