That same ability has an effect on druids, too.  It forces druids into catform.<br />
<br />
A bear tanking the dragon that is suddenly forced into cat form is going to be very squishy indeed...<br />
This means a bear tank would be no good on Nefarion, right?  <br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
A druid who has never learned cat form from the trainer is immune to Nefarion's class call ability.  They don't turn into cats, and so never take extra damage and suffer no ill-effects whatsoever.<br />
<br />
sneaky druid tricks.. =)<br />

<br />
Wait.  Someone would actually level all the way to 70 without knowing cat form?<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, I know it could be done, but even as resto or balance, to never have the option of popping to cat for dps or stealth?<br />
<br />
Wow.</div></div><hr />

Before the expansion, your guild gets through MC and UBRS and most of BWL, then wipes repeatedly on Nef. People get discouraged and start to complain. Then the guild leader has an idea: &quot;Someone needs to level up a druid and never train cat form.&quot;<br />

(didn't help me that I was resto-specced the whole time). I believe it is entirely possible to get to 60 and even 70 without using cat form. It would be a bit odd to skip, since training it costs 10 silver (refresh my memory), but hey, stranger things have happened.</div></div><hr />
