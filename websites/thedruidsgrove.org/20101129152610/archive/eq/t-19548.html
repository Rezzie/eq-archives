Americans’ Role Seen in Uganda Anti-Gay Push  (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/world/africa/04uganda.html)<br />

KAMPALA, Uganda — Last March, three American evangelical Christians, whose teachings about “curing” homosexuals have been widely discredited in the United States, arrived here in Uganda’s capital to give a series of talks. <br />
<br />
The theme of the event, according to Stephen Langa, its Ugandan organizer, was “the gay agenda — that whole hidden and dark agenda” — and the threat homosexuals posed to Bible-based values and the traditional African family.<br />
<br />
For three days, according to participants and audio recordings, thousands of Ugandans, including police officers, teachers and national politicians, listened raptly to the Americans, who were presented as experts on homosexuality. The visitors discussed how to make gay people straight, how gay men often sodomized teenage boys and how “the gay movement is an evil institution” whose goal is “to defeat the marriage-based society and replace it with a culture of sexual promiscuity.”<br />
<br />
Now the three Americans are finding themselves on the defensive, saying they had no intention of helping stoke the kind of anger that could lead to what came next: a bill to impose a death sentence for homosexual behavior.<br />

I wonder if they would have been able to get away with it, had it been, say, a group of Muslims trying to exorcise the demons of Jesus from a Christian.</div></div><hr />

While homosexuality is already banned in Uganda, the bill (page 6) states that &quot;aggravated homosexuality shall be liable on conviction to suffer death.&quot; Aggravated homosexuality includes homosexual acts with a disabled person and with someone under 18. The &quot;offender&quot; can also be executed if he's HIV positive.Our laws are only slightly more refined than Uganda's.<br />
<br />
We forgo the physical execution, and just put you in prison for a very long time and ostracize you completely from society when you get out.<br />
<br />
By the way it's a serious felony in California to knowingly expose someone to HIV without their permission.  That is the only law being bounced around here that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, right.  They'd do it in the US if they could.<br />
