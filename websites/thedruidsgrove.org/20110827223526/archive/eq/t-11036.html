I think they are rare as thats the one item we are having problems on and with the bracers getting an upgrade last patch, they are quite rockin' now.</div></div><hr />

WoS and zones under WoS are for tier 1 armor drops it seems.  PG, RS, Anguish drop tier 2 components and RS basement is the only place of those that has ferans that I recall.</div></div><hr />

I hunt RS ice side quite a bit. Theres a camp down there with nice quick pulls with a bunch of nameds really close together; conveniently for those who are camping the quality hides, the camp is very close to the room that they drop in. Also as a bonus, is the 20ac aug (Ore of Stone Strength (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70292) that drops from this camp.</div></div><hr />

Can you give a rough description where this is? I will be helping guildies gather these hides in the future and might as well pick a decent spot to set up camp.</div></div><hr />
