<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, I always expect a level 65 bard to be good.  All the ones I've ever played with are generally very good!  Slightly insane, yes, but good! <br />
<br />
Well yesterday I found the exception.  His name is permanently engraved on my &quot;do not group with ever under any circumstances&quot; list.<br />
<br />
My first clue should have been when I asked this bard to join the ldon group he said, &quot;What classes do you have?&quot;.  So I told him.  Why should he really care?  I could understand levels if he didn't want to play in a lower-level dungeon, but classes didn't make sense. <br />
<br />
So we form up the group and I told the group we'd do an assassinate, rescue or slaughter.  The bard only wanted to do slaughter.  But I refused to sit in front of the recruiter for 45 minutes looking for one, so I took an assassinate.<br />
<br />
So we get to the dungeon.  I ask the bard to pull.  He tells me he isn't a good puller.  /sigh    I feel like I've now wasted a slot in the group since we have an enchanter.  Well, I convince him to pull anyway, trying to hurry him into doing chain pulls for bringing more than one at a time.  <br />
<br />
Because of his pulling we're killing at the incredibly slow rate of 1 every 90 seconds, which is nearly twice as slow as normal.<br />
<br />
Couple that with an enchanter that seems to be suffering from ADHD forgetting to slow and mez things and things are pretty out of control each fight.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the bard is complaining about pulling each and every fight.  I have to keep prodding him to go pull the next before the last is finished.  <br />
<br />
Finally the bard pawns the pulling job off onto the level 63 ranger.  At least the pulls are coming faster, if somewhat larger than this group can really handle.  My cleric is up to the task though.  With Divine arbitration, free group heals and me paying close attention, no one dies even though things are close at times.<br />
<br />
The bard says, &quot;I told you to get a slaughter mission because I'm not a good puller&quot;.  LOL!  I have to echo this is guild for everyone's enjoyment.  Which was a lie, he didn't warn us he wasn't a good puller until we entered the dungeon.  And why would a slaughter mission pulling be any different from another mission?  <br />
<br />
We get to the boss, have about half an hour to spare, only have killed 41 mobs at this point(!?!) and the warrior gets excited and engages before anyone is ready.  Doesn't go defensive until too late also, so my cleric is casting tiny heals to keep him alive which causes her to get aggro and die.<br />
<br />
Ok, no problem.  30 minutes to recover.  Easy.  Boss is camping corpses, so I (me, rogue) ask for consent.  Get it from two people.  Ask for consent.  Get none.  Ask for consent.  Get none.  Scream for consent.  Get one more.  Start losing my temper.  Still no consent from the bard.  Froth at the mouth and decide the bard can just go screw himself we'll finish without him.  Not like he's contributing anything anyway.<br />
<br />
I run cleric in (I bound at the dungeon, how'd I know I was going to need to?  I have a sixth sense about these things now).  Res everyone except the bard who still hasn't consented.<br />
<br />
Ah!  I remember that my cleric has Divine Res now, so she gets back to FM and HoV's everyone!  Yippee!   Still no bard consent.<br />
<br />
Finally we're about ready to try again and the bard says, &quot;aren't you going to res me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Arggggggggh!  Arggggggggh!  Arggggggggh! <br />
<br />
Sometimes I get very quiet and polite when I'm furious.  This wasn't one of those times....<br />
<br />
At any rate, after debating not ressing him, I did res him.  He was mostly harmless, just annoying the hell out of me at this point.   So I told him he could forget about having Virtue we didn't have the time for it.<br />
<br />
This time, warrior waits until everyone is ready.  Still doesn't engage defensive right away.  But my cleric uses Divine Arb on that first panicky heal so she doesn't get aggro.  However, enchanter immediately tashes before warrior really has much aggro.  Boss bounces onto the enchanter, kills him in record time.  Great... unslowed boss mob... lowish dps group.<br />
<br />
We fight him, cleric mana getting low because she literally is chaining cheals and sometimes barely keeping the warrior up.  I manage to grab aggro somehow (as rogue) and evade fails a couple times in a row and I'm dead.  Meanwhile, 3 minutes tick past and the warrior's defensive discipline is dropping.  At just about that time, my cleric runs out of mana.   2nd wipe.  <br />
<br />
/sigh  I give up at that point.  I just want this group to end so badly I don't even want the 13 point win.  So I start dragging bodies, ressing people.  Enchanter starts running around, gets himself killed.  We find him, res him again.  He starts running around again, gets himself kill yet again and he trains another group member (one of your guildies, Trevize!).  <br />
<br />
So rather than risk him doing it a third time, I wait outside with my cleric to res him when he pops.</div></div><hr />

Be it either LDON was boot camp for those were doing badly or they left I don't know.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER....<br />
<br />
I need to describe this for background.<br />
<br />
Ranger, Paladin, Druid, Mage, Warrior, Shaman.  65 level dungeon.  Miragul's Menagerie.<br />
<br />
It was an all guild group this time. The Spider Cave (which is strangely lacking in spiders).   We did a 54 slaughter very quickly and very well.  No deaths except me once, which happens.<br />
<br />
We win; but this isn't the story, this is the background.  It is significant because the next mission we had to replace the druid with a random player.  Also a druid level 65.<br />
<br />
I, too, do not like to sit at the recruiter for an hour to get a specific mission.  I take the first one that has a reasonable chance for success based on my experience. <br />
<br />
This time we end up with an assassination on the Heart of the Menagerie.  I am now of the belief that Heart of the Menagerie is far too long a map to do an assassination or rescue on.  That's not the problem, however.<br />
<br />
The druid wasn't up to the standard of our guildie druid.  Granted, we shouldn't expect him to be.  But this guy was the opposite of fine wine.  He didn't get better or even stay the same with age.  He actually got worse.<br />
<br />
To begin, I had to root pull.  I try to carefully pick targets and do a fair  job at it.  Thankfully I wasn't being followed this time on pulls like I had been the last few days.<br />
<br />
At first, the druid was a little slow on heals but not terrible.  In fact, things seemed fine except for his complaint that we needed to have an enchanter to win.  Which I know we don't, since I am rarely blessed with an enchanter to group with and I've won.<br />
<br />
Eventually we get to the inevitable 5 pull room.  We work it so that only 3 are in the room at a time.  I don't know what happened here but everyone ran out of mana.  We stayed alive until I had run oom and both of my LOH had gone down.<br />
<br />
We run back into the dungeon and get bodies and buff up again.  Then I commence pulls.  We get another three and again, I don't know what happened.  I ran oom on group heals, shaman and ranger ran oom and we wiped again.  This was one room after we killed the last three pull.<br />
<br />
Ok, we come back, repeat the procedure we just completed and again I go to pull.  We do ok for a while but it seems to me that the shaman is having to do the healing.  We have to stop to med (which is a killer in LDON).  Then I go out to pull.  We get the three.  This time we wipe faster than ever.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this druid is used to a slower pace or panics on seeing a number of mobs more than one.  I think its a bit of the later with a mindset that you can't perform without an enchanter.<br />
<br />
I find it interesting because it was the exact same group makeup with hugely different results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then my other issue is I never have good luck with anyone that asks me who is in the group.  That usually indicates they are bad players and need an enchanter, cleric and warrior to limp along.  But I find my groups with random enchanter, cleric and warrior usually suck royally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Asking what is in the group isn't always a bad thing. Some times you may have a friend who is also LFG. Or, there is the situation I am in with my alts... I have a 54 Paladin and a 56 Shaman. A 37 Cleric and a 34 Beastlord. I sometimes see a group of suitable level for one of those level ranges shouting for more members while I am getting bored of trying to scrounge up a group for my 65 Magician. Asking what they have makes it easier for me to decide which to offer.<br />
<br />
Of course, most people who are asking &quot;What ya got already?&quot;, especially for 65 groups, are dumbasses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to be fair it depends on the situation.  <br />
<br />
More than a few times already I get a random &quot;lfg xxx?&quot; where xxx is one of the LDoN camps.  Now, I'll do any of them and frankly I'll go with pretty much any crew.  Still, I've noticed an annoying trend where I'll get an invite and see that I'm the third person in the group with two people I don't know and of classes or levels (or anon) that is hardly the basis for a good core.<br />
<br />
Another factor I suppose is that LDoN has brought back my Do Not Group List and there are quite a number of morons on it already.  Some for gross incompetance, one for flat out bailing on the group because &quot;there's no way we can finish&quot; (we did without him) and a few that are just plain asses that I'd managed to avoid in the past.  So I will sometimes ask &quot;who's with you?&quot; to avoid the slightly embarrassing suddenly-having-to-leave thing.  I don't advertise my DNGL but I do stick by it.</div></div><hr />

I hate this.  Maybe it's because randomly getting asked for a group from levels 39 to 63 was such a rarity but If I get asked and I have time..I'm going.<br />
<br />
When I put together a group from the LFG tool I'll try and pick from the more advanced guilds, specifically for tanks..but beyond that I just look for the classes needed.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing I hate more is &quot;no cleric?&quot;... (granted I love having a cleric with me and going DPS mode)..</div></div><hr />

Doubt that.  In my experience playing a bard, it doesn't really matter much.  I have one set of songs I keep up, and only switch others in on occassion.  Usual battle songs are either Slow, Haste, and Heal song -- or Slow, Haste, DS -- or if we have a slower, Haste, DS, Heal.. toss in a snare when mob gets low if it's a runner..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arienne</div><div class="date">11-03-2003, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Panamah, you usually seem pretty levelheaded but this isn't one of those times.  First, you are two boxing which puts more strain on the entire group.  Ok.. no big deal.  I'm sure when you asked the bard and other group members to join you mentioned that you were playing both chars.  But to blame your bard for all the problems then going on to say that the warrior screwed up.. then the enchanter screwed up.. then the enchanter screwed up again.. and again...  And I would bet that they others were telling their friends about the group with &quot;yeah and the cleric was busy playing her rogue and let the tank die&quot; or &quot;we didn't have much DPS because the rogue was too busy healing with her cleric&quot; or who knows what!<br />
<br />
So the bard didn't like to pull, you had a ranger who would and could, you had a chanter to mez the adds... yet you insisted on remolding the bard to play the type of bard YOU wanted and not the bard that he preferred to play.  That in itself was the start of the downhill slide.  Maybe your idea of what a bard can be was better than the other player's, but he knew his capabilities and you didn't.  &quot;I am not a good puller&quot; wasn't mentioned before the start of the LDoN, but it doesn't sound to me like you let him know that you intended him to be the main puller either.<br />
<br />
Call it the luck of the draw, but it sounds like certain expectations and &quot;jobs&quot; within a group should be established before you accept an adventure.  If there is a non &quot;fit&quot;, it's best to know before getting started than to find out after you have clicked in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I seem to do well enough.  Believe me, the only reason I ever MA is because the tank can't pull the mob off of me once I've pulled it.  If I toss in a slow/snare, the mob rarely, if ever, turns.<br />

At lower levels, singing haste when you are already haste buffed is a waste.<br />

I was under the impression that haste stacked, up to a point.  Including 1 spell haste, 1 song haste, and 1 item haste.  Has this been changed or am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
<br />
In my experience, counting on a bard to snare is like asking a rogue to nuke. It's just not gonna happen!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I end up having to snare 90% of the time! So that's just not always true!<br />
<br />
Since hitting 46, I tank alot less, but that's because I'm starting to run across plate tanks who actually use taunt and have a decent weapon or two.</div></div><hr />

Some of the bard songs can take you over the haste cap from what I understand.  But the details are outside my experience!</div></div><hr />

<br />
reply:<br />
<br />
that was a mistaken assumption on many many peoples part for the longest time.<br />
<br />
it was based on the fact, that you would get the Bard Icon/Spell to stack with the Chanter/Shaman haste spell.<br />
<br />
However, only the HIGHEST haste percentage is used.  Some bard hastes have other effects which still kick i<br />
n, but only the highest Haste is counted.<br />
<br />
Monk epic also gave this false impression by appearing to stack.<br />
However, it didn't add any haste, just attack when used by a monk with Celerity (50)+ haste<br />
<br />
So it really works like this.<br />
1 Item Haste<br />
1 Spell Haste (Bard/Chanter/Shaman/Bst/Clicky Item)<br />
1 OVER Haste ((bards have a couple 50+ song lines that do stack<br />
with all other hastes including thier own))<br />
1 Quiver Haste (for bows only)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormlin</div><div class="date">11-04-2003, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it is significantly more of a PITA for a bard since it has such a short duration and also is a slow so has hella aggro.  You have to twist it in order to keep it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vilia's Chorus of Celerity <br />
Increase Attack Speed by 45%<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1757&amp;source=Live<br />
is 45% standard haste in Slot 1<br />
<br />
Celerity is <br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=171&amp;source=Live<br />
is up to  50% standard haste also in Slot 1<br />
<br />
As such only Celerity's 50% kicks in because it is the same slot<br />
But because bards are so broke, the icons will still stack.<br />
<br />
Now something like Warsong of Vah Shir<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2610&amp;source=Live<br />
Increase Haste v3 by 25%<br />

its that V3  that makes it the 3rd type of stackable haste.</div></div><hr />

That said, the bard sucked.  Chalk it up to a learning experiance :P</div></div><hr />

I out perform probably a goodly number of the clerics that don't two-box that I get in random, and sometimes not-so-random, groups.  If good clerics were readily available, I wouldn't two box.  I like to chat it up and relax a bit, and two-boxing isn't condusive to that. <br />
<br />
There's one area my cleric doesn't do as well as some:  I don't melee with my cleric so the DPS isn't as good.  And one nice thing is, my cleric ALWAYS handles the damage shields that carve me up so badly.   She seems to know exactly what I want...<br />
<br />
In fact, me two-boxing with my cleric makes a good pulling team, as I'm learning.  I target, she pacifies, I pull.  None of the futzing with communications problems that two individual players often have.  Only problem is, when I pull, I chain pull and my DPS is way off because I'm spending most of my time pulling.  And that part can ruin a group too if you can't kill stuff fast enough.  So I'm not the best choice as a puller.  A cleric with lots of guts and brains could probably do better pulling on his/her own without the group sacrificing so much DPS, but I don't find many clerics willing to pull.<br />
<br />
I played in LDoN with a guy that was 5-boxing, usually he 6-boxes but he wanted a little extra DPS this time.  We won handily. <br />
<br />
But having a cleric with 120 AA's makes it that much easier as well.  Now tonight, I two-boxed my shammy and I must say, I stunk the place up.  I was way rusty.  Back in PoP and Luclin, 4 boxing was fine, but now I only trust myself with 2.  It'd probably take me a night or two to get back the shammy skillz. <br />
<br />
BTW: my guildies responded with that &quot;you can't 2-box in ldon!&quot; and then I did, now they have absolutely no hesitation of grouping with me and my cleric-bot.  In fact, we routinely do pulls of 3-4, an occassional 5, with no mezzer and somehow my little 2-boxed cleric manages to keep everyone alive, including herself and never runs out of mana.  Meanwhile, I don't miss a backstab unless the poop really hits the fan, and my DPS will go down until things get back under control.<br />
<br />
How do I do it?  Well, two things help:  Really good hotkeys, 4 years experience in watching hit points and EQWatcher pointing out things I might miss, like resists.<br />
<br />
Besides, clerics are insanely easy to 2-box.  So are druids.  In fact, most casters are.</div></div><hr />

What classes do you box?  I'd try 3-boxing in LDoN, but I just don't want that stress!</div></div><hr />

Usually only 3 box if i need a 2nd non-rogue melee in the group<br />
and then BST makes the most sense since pets dps is easy click.<br />
and agro is easy to establish.  ((easy to establish on ranger too but ranger is a twink))</div></div><hr />

The druid was our healer, she was out of mana all the time.  Didn't nuke anything and cast greater healing to heal people.  This she did once or twice a fight.  We lived as long as we did because I started doing the healing.  After I ran out of mana we began to wipe where she evaced us.  I aborted the mission to save everyone the greif.  If I could have strangled her, I would have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't play that much any more, but have done 60some adventures, with the only fail a collect with a low dps group early on.  But incredible is just not a sufficient adjective to apply to the crappiness of the group I was just in.  <br />
<br />
Had a monk who was afk a lot, from the start of the dungeon.  Dunno why, maybe he was behind from afk again, but halfway thru he charged into a roomful of mobs and died (no he wasn't puller).  Then when he got back, he took a wrong turn and died again, so just logged off.  So we had about 2/3 of a monk for 1/2 an adventure.<br />
<br />
Had an enchanter and wizard, who were being duo boxed, ench died from a loot-named that was a roamer and added, died before I could get a heal off.  Then I suppose while running back, wasn't paying attention, cause the wizard wandered of and aggroed a mob and died.  Not much loss, the duo box wizard often didn't cast even 1 nuke per mob.<br />
<br />
Had apparently a decent shaman, he did ok slowing, but when we got to the assasinate boss, he followed the enchanter into the room, and they aggroed stuff and died.  I evacced.<br />
<br />
Failed at this point, but went back to try for consolation points.  Successfully pulled the boss, but he had a hard to resist ghoulroot proc, so warrior is immediately rooted.  He stands there saying I'm rooted, bring the mob over here.  The ench casts slow, sticks, but he gets aggro.  so he stands there for 15 seconds getting beat on while I heal him, never moves.  Then the shaman puts his slow on, it aggroes shaman.  Shaman then runs circles around the outside room, which has not been completely cleared, and I can't get los for root since we were fighting on a ledge.  Warr is still rooted, and yelling to bring the mob over.  For some reason I'm still healing shaman, but he finally dies.  Settles down a little at that point, until the warrior forgets to turn off attack and dies to enrage, doh.<br />
<br />
I get summoned and rooted on top of mob, I am yelling nuke for 20 seconds while I keep myself healed and try to nuke boss mob.  Nobody nukes until after I die, they die with boss at like 1%.</div></div><hr />

This is not because I won't play without one (though they are handy), but because, as I came back from nearly a year away, my FT is nonexistant, my cash supply is worse, and I just barely made Baron (No MC).  If I don't get a KEI before I head into a zone with a group, I'm slowing them down, especially if I'm main healer.  This isn't to say that when I die (hey, it happens :) ) that I will leave- will keep on after recovering without the extra mana regen, but if I have it for even a handful of fights, it benefits everybody.</div></div><hr />
