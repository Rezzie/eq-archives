It's only 8 runs though, but that takes over an hour and there's and expansion to enjoy.  Here's what I've found and a bit that's known:<br />

Indoor/outdoor: yes<br />
Cold resist: +80<br />
run modifier: none or very near run 5<br />

all applicable mana pres removed<br />
(info with a star I checked at least 3 times)<br />
<br />
Casting level 72 standard heal: pure life:<br />

Highest mana savings:<br />
12776 - 12206 = 570 (base cost of heal without wolf)<br />
12776 - 12318 = 458 (lowest cost achieved with wolf)<br />
570 - 458 = 112 (mana saved)<br />
112 / 570 = .19649<br />
.19649 * 100% =~ 19.6%<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
No detrimental spell appeared to have any effect.  White wolf mana pres is beneficial spells only with a random saving each cast between 0 and 20%<br />

As I said, Lucy is probably right and it's 15%, I just dont have a means of testing it quickly and taking the ticks in to account.  Obviously they could be timed, and I'd have done that if I had thought about it as an issue.<br />

What I found odd is Lucy still works, yet since it doesn't log updates it seemed resonable to assume it had stoped.</div></div><hr />

I am SOOOO horribly upset. I spent 31 hours straight griding to 75. Then another 6 or 7 to get the 9 aa for this. This was supposed to be our big cool level 75 thing?<br />
 <br />
What good is a 15% mana pres that lasts for ONE MIN and 30 SEC? I thought it was one hour and 12 mins. I am sooooooo mad. First off, it's not preserving crap. Second off, what good is an 80 cold buff for a min. AND TEN MIN RECAST??? I clicked this all happy when I got it and MAN did I get upset in a hurry. This AA serves NO purpose at all. Only thing you can do is go in guild hall and turn into a white wolf where it won't fade and then run around goin oooh oooh look at me I wasted 3 days of my life for nothing.<br />
 <br />
I'm fuming again. And I WAS happy BEFORE I got it. (<br />
 <br />
edit: I thought I looked at the buff a bit late when I saw a min. 12 but nope, apparently it's even WORSE than I thought! It's only ONE MINUTE! My extra few seconds were from extension aa's. Who'd have thought it could be even worse than it originally was. /sigh<br />

<br />
The extra 15% I am sure is random, and works on any bennifical spell you cast within the duration of the buff.  So your going to add an extra 7% mana savings while using the AA.<br />
<br />
I believe the AA was intended for encounters which would otherwise ensure a total drain, or heavy drain of our mana due to non-stop patching.  It, imo, was not designed to give us a permenant 7% increase to our mana efficancy while healing.<br />
<br />
It's a situational AA, but I feel does the job nicely when you know your going to be spam healing alot.  /shrug<br />

<br />
It works on all of our heals currently, The focus doesn't exclude KR at present time.  For those with Anguish BPs, Anicent just got an average of 20% mana savings ontop of SCM while the effect is running.<br />
<br />
Its ment to give you the extra boost you need for incombat mana savings, not as a permentant effect, but as those slightly longer fights where mana begins to run dry, you can make yourself last a few heals longer then you would have before hand.<br />
<br />
I'm still not seeing how this is bad.  I would have loved a Black Wolf form for Deterimental to go with it.<br />

<br />
On a fight where I am constantly patch healing and they last for a considerable time, I'll take the extra savings that I can get. It's not taking anything away from us it's giving us something on top of what we already have. So it's 1.30? If you want to look like a white wolf permanently there are spells for that. The effect it gives is something new and beneficial to us and I will continue to use it when it pops!</div></div><hr />

For me, that situation is sufficiently rare that I won't be buying it any time soon, though.  I spam-heal-to-empty rarely, and would rather spend the AA on stuff that might keep me alive longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krystae Lunalupus</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that I mind a mana pres every now and then.  That's fine of course.  My issue is the whole wolf form thing.  It's been forever since we got a REAL wolf form and I was hoping this was it.  And it is not.  I suppose I will be using it since I&quot;m stuck with it now (even though I see no extra saving in mana that makes it worth it).  I just REALLY wanted a new cool wolf form.  Was hoping for something like our last wolf form that could be used indoors or some sort of wolf form that would actually be useful to us to use.  Not for a min.  And it is ONE min. not the min. 30 I had read.  I saw mine at min 12 when I looked and assume that's from extension aa's.  But spell data says it's only one min.<br />
 <br />
Anyhow, like in EQ2 wolf form gives focus (which is channeling here and we all know that's broken now).  So there I keep it up always.  Just wanted a reason to use wolf again other than racing group, friends, and guildies across mpg.<br />
 <br />
I still say it's a very disappointing aa and really makes me sad.  Honestly if it just worked doing what it does without the wolf illusion I probably would've gotten based on what it does and used it liking it.  It's just that I was so excited over a new wolf form and this is not a wolf form it's a cruel joke.</div></div><hr />

Spirit of the White Wolf is basically a healing stance which is extended to 90 seconds with SCRM AAs.  There is no downside.  You are not giving up 50% offensive capability.  You do however nearly reach clerical efficancy in terms of Hitpoints healed to mana spent.<br />
<br />
You can complain all you like about the duration of the AA, but we're not losing ANYTHING while we increase our efficancy healing, and that is a important balancing point.  Combined with fairly quick recycle, its a decent AA worth the cost provided you spent a good portion of your time healing.<br />
<br />
I suggested they remove the indoor restrictions from Wolf Form in Beta, at least on Form of the Hunter.  It didn't go live, but it was suggested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onetree Tallbarque</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hoping it would increase offensive efficiency, not healing. If you've ever watched a pack of wolves hunt down then tear into prey, you'll understand. That, to me, is fascinating. They're quite smart; social hunters near the top of the food chain, thriving in the wild. Real wolves have nothing to do with healing. If you break a leg, oh well. It's survival of the fittest out there. The same, it can be argued, holds true on Norrath. Thus, any wolven ability granted should have something to do with one or more of the following: hunt efficiency, aggression, tracking, speed of movement, tactics, or social hierarchy. This AA is not in keeping with the true spirit of wolves, the magnificent hunters they are.<br />
<br />
Ok, so maybe you like the small benefit this one gives. It was so small I didn't notice it in beta. Just bear in mind that some of us expected something more in keeping with its given name.</div></div><hr />

I MH and heal on raids all the time - it feels like all I do is spam spam spam those heals and this AA is a wonderful bonus. I don't think its a defining aa for your healing abilities, more like Fenier said a boost. If healing is what you do primarily it's a good aa to buy - not a waste or the dumbest aa ever. If all you do is solo or dps it's probably not the aa for you.<br />

i am ALWAYS in wof form, indoor and outdoor, always. Even when MH, as i use the +atk to hit and steal mana off mobs... Will this aa be blocked by the wolf form illusions? <br />
I illusion constantly and after the White wolf wears off my illusion is still on - shouldn't affect your wolf form. I can try it out for you later to make sure though if you would like.<br />

edit: I just cast form the hunter then White Wolf then clicked it off. I went from a black wolf to a white wolf to a black wolf np!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think that this AA benefits Druids who are main healers least, although you could probably make it work popping it every ten mins.  But in my opinion, Nuking druids and backup healers really benefit from SotWW the most.  <br />
 <br />
When the main healer can't keep up with the heals, and you have to step up, but you've been doing the nuke thing and your mana is not at max, you pop the AA and effectively increase your mana pool by 20 percent.  That's where I see this AA getting the most use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For an XP grind, ~7% mana pres 15% of the time is an average of ~1% mana pres.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krystae Lunalupus</div><div class="date">09-28-2006, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, maybe I was too upset originally to make myself clear.  I have now been experimenting with this in various situations (solo, duo, group healer, group dps, raid healer, raid dps).  It does in fact seem to save a decent amount of mana.  I still say the 10 min. recast is a bit much, five woulda been nice.  However, my issue is still the whole fact that it is a &quot;wolf form&quot;.  I totally agree with Onetree on the wolf issue.  See, that's what I was hoping for, he explains it far more elequently than I do though.  =)  I expected a wolf form to have run speed at least, and yes it should have more of an offensive effect.  Healing is not wolf form.  If it was intended to save mana for healing than perhaps it should've been a treant form like the heal crit aspect of the eq2 druid aa shapeshift.<br />
 <br />
I am VERY glad that you suggested that they make form of the hunter indoor usable Fenier.  That would make me so incredibly happy you have NO idea.  It's a shame that soe doesn't seem to see it as such.  Whoever's idea it was that wolf related buffs should only be outdoors is wrong imo.  I mean is this to say a wolf would never go in a cave for example?  Or crawl into the den of some unsuspecting monster to prey upon the inhabitants for food or whatever.  Wolves most certainly go indoors.  They go wherever they want lol.  They let wolf form be indoors in eq2 so why not eq1?  The run speed?  Bards can do warp 10 anywhere they feel like.  So, I really see no reason whatsoever that our wolf form should be outdoor only.<br />
 <br />
I'm not totally knocking this aa.  I see it's uses and it does help, not that I ever really had such a bad mana issue that I really needed a little more.  But, it does let me chain nuke like crazy and pull aggro off the tanks which yeah I know is not smart but with guildies and friends it's hella fun to hear the tanks squirm that a druid stole their aggro lol.<br />
 <br />
I was just looking for more of a wolf form.  It's been so horribly long since we had a new one.  I would've liked a nice wolf form spell or aa whichever.  Something new, something fun.<br />
 <br />
The only real problem I have using this aa is the illusion itself.  Since we haven't had a useful wolf from in ages I'm usually in skele form from my trusty AoN.  This of course will not stack.  It also will not stack if we're on a mount.  Or if we're in another wolf form.  Several instances where we just flat out can't use it at all.  So, I have to wonder for example, is it better when outdoors on a mount to stay on mount or to dismount to use this aa?<br />
 <br />
What I would suggest, that would solve most of this is simple.  Take the illusion portion off this aa so we can use it in regular wolf form or on a mount or whenever.  And then add a spell or aa to give us a &quot;real&quot; wolf form upgrade to form of the hunter.  This to me would be my perfect dream solution.  Sadly, I don't expect it to happen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seishi</div><div class="date">09-28-2006, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My perfect dream solution would be to allow us to have this on all the time. Having a random 15% beneficial only mana pres for one minute saves what? MAYBE 500 mana every ten minutes? And that's assuming you pop it the second it's able to be used again. The cold resist portion of it is worthless. Who needs that for a minute? As someone said earlier, as it stands it's less efficient than secondary forte. I'd rather have Yaulp. I want my AAs back.<br />
 <br />
I don't see why it isn't broken to give wizards basically infinite mana in this expansion (in case you don't know, their new harvest gives back 5.5k mana with a ten minute refresh - and yes Fenier, I know they get rooted and stunned for a few seconds while using it but who the hell cares, it just means that they can't safely use it in combat while soloing, oh god no, anything but that). Not to mention they get these great new spells that have an instant cast time, allowing them to kite literally anything in the game that doesn't summon, even without snare. Enchanters also get an instant 1k mana refresh stone (and yes Fenier, I know it uses roughly 3k mana to use the AA to get that stone, but who the hell cares, it just means they use the AA to get the stone during a resting period, perhaps a good example would be when the group's druid is out of mana), not to mention the fact that they're still the only class in the game with anything resembling gather mana (well, with the exception of wizards now).<br />
 <br />
Sorry... But it's my opinion that if these classes can have nifty abilities like that, then we should be able to have at least an extra 10% mana pres. I was extremely excited when I heard about this AA. I made sure I kept 9 AA points stocked for the second I dinged to level 75. I hurried to level 75, bought this AA, used it, annnnd... haven't really used it since, because it pissed me off like crazy. It didn't help that at roughly the same time, wizard and enchanter friends of mine were going on and on about how awesome their new abilities are. It's not fair. Either give me my AAs back so I can just buy something else, or change this to be something worth using!</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying there shouldn't be any sort of a power trade-off. All I'm saying is that it seems like they're taunting us and giving other classes all the cool stuff, most of which, in my opinion, is a bit over-powered. The enchanter one isn't over-powered, no, and it's really awesome that they got something like that, I just think we need something similar too, or at least that this AA is made to actually be worth using. As it stands right now, I honestly think it sucks.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and you mean the negative proc that only lasts like 18 seconds like ours? So wizards lose 18 seconds of nuking time, oh well. Just wait it out... It apparently isn't so much of a big deal if my wizard friend who was kiting with it all day long didn't even mention it. Even he says it's broken and should be changed.<br />
 <br />
As for the cleric spell, that's not something meant to be used during a group or raid situation unless of course you're fighting something so easy that some clerics don't need to heal, it's to be used to help them solo, which my cleric friend did and loved (even though she hated soloing before and said she'd never use the spell, she actually really likes it now).<br />
 <br />
Point of the post... even though they have negative effects, people still love them apparently, so much that they fail to even mention the negative effects. But the negative effect of this AA (meaning the extremely short duration) is definitely worth mentioning since the positive effect as it stands is barely worth mentioning (as stated, less efficient than Secondary Forte) ;)</div></div><hr />

Frankly, it just grates at me that something can be so marginal in effect (a) compared to other classes &quot;equivalents&quot;; (b) so limited in use and (c) cost 9aa.<br />
<br />
On the basis that it's mainly a raid tool, if you're raiding outdoors you'd be better to use a horse (which doesn't stack) for the duration of the fight.  That's gotta tell you something.</div></div><hr />

Healing is not my thing.<br />
<br />
Besides, SotWW has a long recast timer, bad enough that I have Spirit of the Grove and Convergence of Spirit up on my hotbar already for those occasions when I do heal. I don't need a 3rd button with a long timer.<br />
<br />
I rather, see SotWW be a 1 - 2 hour duration buff which gives 3% mana pres to all spells. I will be more than happy to loose a buff slot for that.<br />
<br />
As I said on the eqlive board, I rather spend 1 more AA and get FT2. It's on all the time and I don't have to press anything to use it or ever need to remember to use it.</div></div><hr />

Considering how Pact of the Wolf has an unlimited duration and an almost instant recast and has a semi useful illusion (read: doesn't shrink you and can unshrink you), it &gt; White Wolf. White Wolf's horrifically short duration makes it damn near completely useless.</div></div><hr />

No, it's still as useless as it was when TSS went live. And since I read some more of this thread:<br />
<br />
i am ALWAYS in wof form, indoor and outdoor, always. Even when MH, as i use the +atk to hit and steal mana off mobs... Will this aa be blocked by the wolf form illusions? <br />
You do realize you don't need to hit a mob to proc, right http://smiliesftw.com/x/hsughno.gif?<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I really hope the next expansion DOES have AAs in it, as it desperately needs to. I also hope it has more than just three new spells, and I don't mean TSS spells that we didnt get, I mean completely new upgrades/spell lines. Otherwise, its another expansion where we get royally ****ed in the ass, with its only saving grace being an upgraded Group Heal, which isn't nearly enough to overcome the bad aspects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     Since it costs 9 aa so it *should* have large effect since its not a cheap aa.  Unfortunately the mana savings couple with the drawbacks make it have a relatively small effect.<br />
<br />
Average 7.5 mana savings over a short time period with a long reuse timer.  None of these are really good things.<br />
<br />
     The times that it has proven useful is when Im in full spam heal mode.  If I am cranking through chain heals asap it really does help.  But, this makes it an exteremely limited situational aa.  I love it for these times but it just points out how most of the time this is a useless aa.<br />
<br />
Obviously when we are offensive this is a worthless aa.<br />
<br />
Soloing its a worthless aa.<br />
<br />
When patch healing the mana savings drops to almost nothing, because heals are only being cast intermittently.<br />
<br />
When the main healer goes down and Im suddenly dumped in as emergency healer every scrap of mana becomes precious so its great.  You do have to remember to actually use it in these omg situations, have to usually fit it in between heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
     It is a useful aa at times.  Its just that those times are rare enough that, for the cost, it should be at the bottom of most people's aa list to buy.<br />

Still I can change into a White Wolf now, :), and the FUN aspect makes it worth the cost imo anyways. I bought it after finishing the grind to 75 and wanted to get something fun for my effort so to speak. One day I might even remember to use it on a raid, it could happen :). <br />
I like it any helps better then none and with TSS mobs 9aa's just isn't that much anymore, /shrug. No one actually expected to get something overly useful did they? We are Druids after all, not those other priests... :)</div></div><hr />

Though honestly I don't know why. 9 aa's for a max 15% mana preservation on beneficial spells only and a wasted buff slot. Definately should go to the short buff window. After spam healing the MT and my group, I can't see a difference. I cast the exact same number of heals before I went OOM (10.2k mana pool) as I did without using the aa. Needs a longer duration or reduce the recast time....do something to make me feel better about wasting 9 aa's that were better used for anything else. Can I get a refund?:bs:</div></div><hr />

I dont know one druid that is happy with this AA.  I have to say its a COMPLETE waste.   I usually very very upbeat when it comes to druid abilities - but this is just useless.  What is the point of this AA? I mean what senario was sony putting the druid when they said.. yes druids need a 1 min 30 sec wolf form where they can save unnoticeable amounts of mana - that costs 9 AA.<br />
<br />
I tried.  I REALLY tried to make use of this ability - its RETARTED.  There just isnt enough time to use it.  <br />
<br />
How about 10-15 min use - recastable every hour or something.  1.5 mins???  Christ i blink more then 1 time and the ability is over.<br />
<br />
Has anyone brought this up in the summits or has someone with some insider info find out they might change this retarted ability??<br />
<br />
If i had to do it all over again.. Id put 9AA into the bind wound abilities before this peice of crap.</div></div><hr />

If they put that it lasts for 60 seconds, a lot of people wouldn't have baught the AA ability.</div></div><hr />
