We don't have quite enough at 70 and on regularly to start 25 man content yet, having to wait for some more in the 60s to hit 70.<br />
<br />
Ok, so now that I have told a story that no one probably really cares about... on to my topic...<br />
<br />
What stats do you think a tanking druid would need for stating Zul'Aman. I've heard different stats from various websites and wanted to get opinions from druids that have gone into it.<br />
<br />
I am my guilds OT, and we have a warrior MT.<br />
<br />
I'm not thinking of just running into it tomorrow, but just thinking for how to plan for my guilds future in raiding and when a good time to start looking towards it will be.<br />
<br />
If you do want to compare what gear I do have, I am logged out in my tank gear.</div></div><hr />

ZA isn't a trivial run, even for some well geared groups.  You could probalby take out bear and maybe eagle, but the fights are healing intensive and just a quick glance at the gear the rest of your guild has, you guys have a bit of time of farming Kara and badges.<br />
<br />
Also, you say progressing fairly well through Kara, where are you guys at?<br />
<br />
Just IMO, please don't take offense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohnoto</div><div class="date">08-07-2008, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I say moving through good, in that we killed Curator first week and only two in our group had seen the fights before. Our raids are sat and sun, so we'll see what this week holds for us.<br />
<br />
From another guy in my guild he thinks that we could make some serious attempts on Eagle and possibly Bear also. Which is why I was wondering about the stats. <br />
<br />
Obviously I want to get further into Karazhan and get more of the people geared up, cause we are newer at it. As far as some of the ppl in my guild, there are a few that arent active enough for raiding, but we are starting to get our consistant group.<br />
<br />
I actually wrote up a list of gear that I have and want from badges and Kara. And its about half and half from badge and Kara gear. I usually run one heroic a day, and then what I get from Karazhan.<br />
<br />
Like I said, not planning on running into it tomorrow, just looking for some stat numbers to kinda prepare when a good time to start making attempts in there will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zul Aman is a significant step up from Karazhan.<br />

 <br />
You have to kill the first four bosses within a certain timeframe (i.e. quick as hell).  Each boss that you kill within the alotted time leaves behind a chest which contains an extra epic.  The fourth chest contains a Bear Mount.  In order to get the four chests, you have to be chain-pulling and not stop at all.  One wipe will pretty much ruin the chances of getting to the fourth boss in time.<br />
 <br />
Its a fun challenge, and definitley worth it - Bear mount looks awesome :)</div></div><hr />
