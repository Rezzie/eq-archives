<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our rain spell is supposed to do 3 waves of damage.  However, in ldon, when I use it to nuke 2 mobs, i only see 2 waves of damage.  What's up with this.  I have never seen 3 waves where there were 2 or more mobs in ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rain spells have been limited to a total of 4 NPC hits for a long time.  It wasn't always the case, but rains were somewhat overpowering without this restriction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks.  Now its kindda obvious i don't use rain spells much with multiple mobs.<br />

Btw, eq does a crit check on each wave.  So that means, there's a higher chance you'll do a crit with rain spells with 4 waves (albeit with a smaller increase in damage bec. of the smaller damage base per wave) than with a single wave for regular nuke spells (e.g. winter's frost).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Iilane SalAlur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, you can crit on each wave effectively dealing 4.8k worth of damage. However, I'm still waiting for that elusive triple crit.<br />
<br />
Single crits are semi-common and just that one crit put its damage output above our single nukes.</div></div><hr />
