I was thinking, would there be a scenario or type of situation where you would cast Tranq early vs spamming re-juv and re-growth?<br />
<br />
I have also noticed that parties usually split up right off of the bat and do not stick together.</div></div><hr />

In PVP the enemies tend to focus fire (at least in the battles i have been in), not to mention its way too difficult to try to keep your group near  enough for it to be effective. <br />
<br />
Now, i have been in situations in AB where i have used Rebirth, and it caused us to win that skirmish. I have only done as such a couple times, usually when the fight is really close, and having 1 extra &quot;life&quot; will win it for us.</div></div><hr />

Once in a while, when the other side is stupid enough to be fighting a warrior instead of you, you may get a HT or 2 off. <br />
<br />
Tranq is a lol spell pretty much in general.  Prayer of Healing it aint.</div></div><hr />
