<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wiggume</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think most everyone knows where to powerlevel the low levels. Pauladal Caverns -&gt; Mera Seru will get you to level 30 in a day easily.<br />
<br />
Starting friday evening I took my level 30 bard to the Temple of Droga. I snare pulled 5-15 then let them beat on my DS. All of them beat themselves to death on my DS except for the last one who tried to run, but being snared he just stood there. With my bard I played an AE DoT, which is all he had to do the whole time, well and melee the last mob as it stood there.<br />
<br />
I went to Droga because the same strategy in DsP just didnt seem fast enough and I figured there must be a better place. The mobs in DsP seem to hit harder and have more HP than similar level mobs in Droga, plus being a dungeon there is an EXP bonus. A dark blue mob will give 2% EXP at level 30.<br />
<br />
Buffs are the key here, I will list what I had on at all times.<br />
<br />
1) Grim Aura (my feeble attempt to save my buffs from being dispelled, but the spell the mobs are casting remove buffs in random slots.)<br />
2) Resist Magic<br />
3) PoTG<br />
4) Brackencoat<br />
5) Mask of the Stalker<br />
6) KEI<br />
7) Replenishment<br />
8) Shield of Bracken<br />
9) DS Potion<br />
10) Natures Recovery<br />
<br />
Thats a 86 point DS on me.<br />
<br />
With that I would pull 5-10 mobs at a time just depending on what the rooms looked like mobwise. 5 is easy, 10 is a more efficient use of Buff time but you will have to channel a Heal or 2 during the fight. Whenever SoTW was up I would pull 15 or so, use that and my DS would be 111 points with crazy regen.<br />
<br />
Like I said I started Friday evening at level 30, I hit level 46 on Sunday at about noon. Thats 16 levels in about 2 days. It was pretty constant playing, I took a break Friday to help a rogue friend in Hate and another on Sunday to help a druid in Iceclad.<br />
<br />
I zoned in from FM and fought my way towards the area with the Goblin Traitor then ran around in a loop for levels 30-41. After that I started fighting in the Inner Sanctum area fighting my way back towards the Chief.<br />
<br />
I picked up prolly 5 stacks of Green Goblin Skins and 12 stacks of Goblin Salts. So if you have a char working on chardok faction thats a good way to get them. Or sell them in the bazaar. Just the loot/plat you pick up in there easily pays for the DS potions and KEI's. Welp thats about it, just thought I would share what I have found to be by far the best PL spot for levels 30-46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't forget Shield of the Eighth!  That adds another 8 to your  damage shield (and makes a nice instaclicky too).  You can get the 7th ring solo in a day or less, and the 8th ring is just a matter of finding Gloridain up (a 24 hour spawn).</div></div><hr />

its instant click 25 point DS, 5 charges, but is rechargeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haro the Battlemaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kaesora Library area<br />
<br />
PLd my Paladin there from lvl 35 to 43 in 5 hours. There are about 50 mobs in that area and I used to pull around 6 mobs each time. Tanked about 3 or 4 of the undead there myself with a 65 point dam shield so I didnt need to heal my paladin that often, while he was damaging the remaining 2 or 3.  Dunno if this still works that good. I think there was a change with the damage assignment of the dam shields.</div></div><hr />

That DS doesnt stack with Shield of (Bracken Thorns etc) and is also a major ballache to get the faction. The skins/salts mentioned will help raise faction to help you get the first ring then to get the second ring more faction work is needed and a rare spawn or 3 are needed for hand-ins then you have to wait for the server to be up 3 days in a row for the angry Goblin to spawn which in turn spawns the Boss mob once a hand in has took place. The boss mob is Warlord Skargus and is a SK with a HT of around 1k. May be soloable but better off with a tank friend helping. This is not a 5 minute quest !!<br />
