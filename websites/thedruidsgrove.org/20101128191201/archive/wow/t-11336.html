right now my character is a level 17 Tauren Druid on Crushridge, and I'd HATE to have to start all over again, just to be able to make more coin quicker...<br />

Click on the skill.  There should be a little menu that comes up, that allows you to unlearn it.</div></div><hr />

Changing professions is not bad thing at all.Maybe you will change it few times more cause like you said &quot; I m a noob &quot; so changing professions and learning the ways is not bad thing at all.<br />
<br />
Professions that fit druid are Alchemy and Herba , Skinning &amp; Leatherworking and some other which are not so useful to druid .<br />
<br />
After you become advanced player and get in some endgame guild you could/would be very useful with Herb/Al.Making pots like Fire protection for Molten Core etc is really useful thing and thats what the guild need.<br />
<br />
Leatherworking is more for personal use and later when you are 60 its not useful at all ( except selling items on ah ).<br />
<br />
You can earn gold on any profession , everything depends on item quality , level etc.Getting lw epic patterns is a bit hard and they are really rare ( just few of them in whole game ).<br />
<br />
In some other way profession can be combined with some other things as well . If you started with your friend and if he is around your level than u2 could combine something and earn gold together.He could be blacksmithing and mining and you for example enchanter and alch.<br />
Alchemists can transmute ore so you and your buddy could work together like that.Before you pick anything try to get some friend into the world of warcraft and than think about it.<br />
<br />
Hope this post will be useful to you.</div></div><hr />

It's more to make your own gear, or to supply your guild mates.  If you just wanted to make money, you could go with 2 gathering professions: Skinning and Mining.</div></div><hr />
