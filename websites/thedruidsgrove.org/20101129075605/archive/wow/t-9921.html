All I can say is wow, this instance is HARD without a lock to banish the elementals.  Those floating whirlywind thingies in the main room that travel in packs with one elite were aggroing on our 60s from halfway across the room.  And the big trees at the very beginning are pretty nasty if two get pulled at once.<br />
<br />
Does / did anyone else find that part of DM really hard?  Or were we just a bad group?  I heard tribute is easier too.  Is that the case?<br />
<br />
Thanks.  (I'm probably going to have a bunch of noob 57+ instance questions coming up in the next few days.:shuffle:   Feel free to tell me to plsstfu)<br />

Now I dont and I dont really remember what changed except me and my guildies getting a lot better gear and experience.<br />
<br />
My tip is, if you don't have banish, try to have someone kite the big elemental until the rest of you have killed the small ones. Or just have it tanked.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes. Tribute is easier but remember the reagents. And east is easiest. All of them are fun and rewarding though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, the way to do DM is east, north west.  East has some easy quests to do and some decent caster gear.  North Tribute sets up a quest for killing the Prnce in DM west, so might aswell get that done before you break your neck trying to do west.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking a group of all 60's into east or west is overkill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-19-2006, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that our major problem is that we didn't have a warrior.  I was in bear (cat form my amor is too low to stay alive if I draw aggro from back to back crits), and the 60 pally couldnt hold aggro well enough.  That and the Mage was doing some serious damage, causing the priest to have to heal her furiously, drawing aggro to the priest.  <br />
<br />
The group was good in general, just needed to let someone get and hold aggro better.  A lock would have helped big time for some cc too.<br />
<br />
Running East, then trying it again tonight, and I expect this run to go much easier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-23-2006, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For DM North:<br />
<br />
Feral druid or warrior is a must.  Make sure you've got two solid cc classes and two tanks or three solid cc classes and one tank.  cc class, in this case, is rogue/mage/warlock/hunter.<br />
<br />
As you get better at the 5-mob groups you can get away with non-optimal class selection.  I was in a DM:N boss run last night with a druid (resto), druid (moonkin), mage, mage, warrior.  Warrior runs in, no cc on anything, and sunders a few mobs.  Moonkin runs in and drops hurricane.  Both mages AoE:  one with imp blizz, then Flamestrike; one with a suicide bomber approach.  It worked well, but mostly because the mages were incredible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-23-2006, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow gnarly create..  Was that a Tribute run?  With all the dmg that the mages were doing, how did the warrior keep aggro?  Or did he?  Seems to me that the few sunders wouldnt keep aggro on the warrior with all the gnarly aoe crits that the mages / moonie were throwing down.  I have been thinking about it, and the main reason that my group had such a hard time was the pally.  Pallies cant really hold aggro too well, nor could he regain it once the mage or priest took it from him.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get a tribute run organized tonight.  REALLY want that Unyeilding Maul and / or Staff of the Ogre Magi.  The Band of the Ogre King wouldn't be too bad of an item to have either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-23-2006, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it was not a tribute run.  The only difference between tribute and &quot;boss&quot; run is whether you kill the bosses or not.  Bosses drop loot, not killing them yeilds a big chest of different loot.  Either way you kill the end guys.<br />
<br />
That particular run the warrior was not holding aggro for very long.  He could hold a couple through the initial part of the AoE.  On mage is standing back casting blizz &amp; flamestrike.  Improved blizz (talent) slows movement speed, thus keeping things a bit more under control.  Hurricane is used partially for the damage, but more importantly reduces mob attack speed by 20%, thus providing some relief for me (the resto druid).  The mage in the middle of things does pull aggro.  I would rejuv him before the battle, he then got one regrowth, and my NS HT (or another regrowth).  He knew he had to get out of the fray soon after the second heal so he frost nova's and blink's.<br />
<br />
At this point anything non-elite is dead.  The elites are locked down with frost nova.  Both mages should be close to one another.  The frost mage casts blizzard again and the other mage switches to single target dps on the mob closest to dieing.  If things are getting hairy the frost mage still has frost nova to buy a few seconds.  If it's really bad he can coldsnap (another talent) and frost nova again.<br />
<br />
After the moonkin is done with hurricane he's free to do whatever needs to be done.  That's usually saving the squishies in bear form in case they don't drop what's left.  The best part is if I go OoM or pull healing aggro.  I just bear and the other druid picks up healing.<br />
<br />
Sound complicated?  It's much easier after you took down a few pulls with the same method.  Also, Teamspeak helps immeasurably (like when I pull aggro and need the other druid to pick up a few heals while I lead the mob back to the tank).  Yeah, we had a death here &amp; there.  It's still one of the fastest DM:N runs I've been on.  We finished in maybe an hour 15.  This was a group with maybe two or three epics apiece, if that means anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason alot of people miss the +10int +6mana/5 ring here.  You can get two of them, if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-24-2006, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool create.  Sounds very familiar - I farmed Timbermaw rep yesterday with a 60 frost mage.  He'd run into the camp, frost nova to lock them down, I'd run in, barksin and hurricane (or stand next to him and hurricane, depending on how leeroy I was feeling at the time) while he cast blizz (with the slowdown).  They would be at about 1/3 health, and after hurr was done, I'd drop into bear and pull any of the mobs that had gotten out of the nova lock early and were slowly walking toward the mage.  We grinded about 1500 rep in this manner in about 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Just ran DM North last night, and apparently you need mats to make a suit and a key.  And apparently if you kill one of the guards to get the key, you have to reset the instance to be able to get to tribute.  Took about 3 hours, and we didn't even get through the last door for the boss &gt;&lt;.  But we learned our lesson, and are going back much more well prepared tonight.  Still looking forward to my unyeilding maul (and that ring you mentioned sounds nice too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-24-2006, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I *think* that ring is in West.  One of the few pieces of non-epic gear I still drool over is in West:  the Mintap Talisman.<br />
<br />
Yeah, what are those mats...Thorium widget, frost oil, a few rune thread...<br />
<br />
The first time I went was the first time for everyone in my group.  There's a part where you have to sneak past a guard, open a door, and get inside.  Ahead is another guard, the one that requires the thorium widget &amp; frost oil to repair the trap.  Behind the trap is a goblin with a quest.  He'll make you an ogre suit if you give him the right materials.<br />
<br />
One of those items took us about a half hour to find.<br />
<br />
Ooops, there's no spoiler tags in this forum?  Stop reading here if you don't want me to ruin it.<br />
<br />
It's the only thing not in the AH.  After the trap is a hard left.  It's the only way you can go.  Go up the ramp.  In the far corner on your left is the required item.  Use the suit and talk to the last in the instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-26-2006, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome, thx.  That will certainly save us some time.  On the initial run, we got the suit made just fine (someone was running it on their lv 57 alt, and already knew what was going on).  I had no idea what to do at all; and they got the suit / placed the widget quick and we moved right along.<br />
<br />
Then we got to the final door, and realized that no one had the key that a guard dropps, and we didn't have the time to kill a guard then reset the instance so that we could do tribute.  Your advice will certainly help next time I get in a PuG, assuming that no one else knows whats going on either :)<br />
<br />
Still haven't gotten back there yet - did a few scholo runs yesterday.  Got Boots of the Shreiker and Cadaverous Chest.  Then spent about 2 hours flying around and finishing random chain quests (Winterspring -&gt; EPL, Darnassus -&gt; Un'Goro, Tanaris -&gt; Un'Goro.)  That Linken chain is going to kill me lol.</div></div><hr />

1. Smithed key (truesilver?)<br />
2. Rogue pick (LP 300)<br />
3. Powerful Seaforium Charge (engr - uncommon recipe skill 275 ish)<br />

Since I have a rogue alt, I can camp her near the DM North entrance, log off the char I'm playing once were cleared to the door, then login rogue, join party, stealth in, pick door, hearth out, relogin on other char.</div></div><hr />

You can outfit yourself for feral or healing much better than the Wildheart set can.  Just about all of my pre-MC gear was from DM runs.<br />
<br />
For dealing with the Arcane Torrent groups in West without a Lock in the group....have your AOEers lay down AOE on the group as the tank tags the big guy.  A frost nova and a couple rounds of AOE should take care of the little guys.  By this time, the MT has probably had to be healed twice, then shift attention the the big guy and take him down.  I've done this encounter with just about any group config imaginable, and it can be nasty if you're not familiar with it.<br />
<br />
As far as DM North goes, on tribute or non-tribute, a bear form druid is idea for off-tanking Cho-Rush.  If you're running Tribute, focus on Dodge and AC, not on Damage.  You should do the initial pull on Cho, tank down to about 60% of your health, frenzied regen, tank down to about 50-60%, bash, quick NS HT, back to bear.  That should be all it takes on your part and the healer doesn't need to look your way at all.<br />
<br />
I've run DM so many times it's almost ridiculous, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about it :&gt;</div></div><hr />

I havent run DM in a bit, as I've been doing ludacris amounts of LBRS runs for the WH shoulders. I realize they aren't necessarily that good, but they look wicked. Skip those and get the Cyclone Spaulders from DM tribute instead.  You'll have no competition from your group for leather +heal shoulders.  If you must have them, as I had to, take stealth groups into LBRS.  2 rogues, 2 druids, and the last spot to either class.<br />

Have you learned to solo Smolderweb for your boots?<br />

Hope to get some serious DM action this weekend. Any suggestions on where to go first for some good healer gear? West? North? East?North boss kill is the only place where you'll be short of loot as it focusses more on plate/mail.  North tribute is more caster-focussed.  All wings have good druid stuff.  Snag the healing cloth as well if you're playing healer for the run.</div></div><hr />

That should be all you need and save you some cash.  Once you've got your boots, though, the only reason to do it is for bragging rights.  It's a real pita.    The boots from &quot;The Calling&quot; or from DM Hydrospawn are better anyways.  There's a good pair in Scholo also.  Also, none of the alternatives are purple.<br />

I, once again, found new respect for the balance druid.  I have maybe +30-40 damage and zero balance talents.  I could pull aggro by layering insect swarm, moonfire, and Starfire spam.  I had to wait for tank aggro, just like the mage.  Even then it was a tossup as to who was second on the aggro list.</div></div><hr />
