<br />
52 Blue Dog democrats (conservative democrats), representing southern and some western states.  Have a higher than average number of uninsured.  1 out of 5 no health insurance, 30% higher than the national average.<br />
<br />
Blue dog democrats insisted on co-ops instead of a public option.  <br />
<br />
Low income people working too hard to go to town meetings, less likely to vote, less likely to make campaign contributions and unrepresented in the discussion.<br />
<br />
$300,000 from PACs in health care and health insurance go to these Blue Dogs.</div></div><hr />
