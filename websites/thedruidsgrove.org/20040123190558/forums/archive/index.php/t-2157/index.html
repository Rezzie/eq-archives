<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any advice for taking these guys down solo?  I've heard people in the DG channel say that they could solo them at 60, but never asked what tactic they used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">dot kiting and scoriae</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bixle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Harmony your way through the front guards (or just kill them).  Run in, agro one of the named vamps.  They are immune to changes in run speed, but I usually snare to agro them anyway.  Run out and start kiting!  SOE is essential (or hunter &amp; lev)<br />
<br />
They cast, which is a pain, so have resists up.  The good thing about them casting is that you have time to cast too.  I usually just put a few DOT's on them (affliction haste helps a lot) and ran around, avoiding bats and wolves.  <br />
<br />
Biggest pain: they gate.  So have a stun up when they get down to 20% health or so.  If you are lucky you can interrupt and then nuke them to death.  Otherwise, fight them nearer to the castle when they are low on health.  If they do gate, run in as quick as you can and reagro them.  They will have healed up to about 50% if you do it fast enough, otherwise they will be full health.<br />

I managed to kill a few just fooling around with no kei.</div></div><hr />
