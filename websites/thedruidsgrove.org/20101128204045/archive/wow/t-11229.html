<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">11-02-2006, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feral charge works on all mobs/bosses that can have their spells interrupted (including Lor'khan and bat boss -- I've used it there myself). They're immune to the rooting effect of FC, but not the spell interruption effect. :)<br />
<br />
...and bash isn't really a spell interrupt -- it's a stun. If they get stunned they naturally stop casting, but a lot more mobs are immune to stuns (and therefore bash) than mobs that are immune to spell interrupts (kick, pummel, shield bash, counterspell, feral charge, etc).<br />
<br />
I've yet to find a boss that can't be feral charged to interrupt a spellcast. :)</div></div><hr />

Can that be resisted?</div></div><hr />

Think Warriors and rogues are enough to interrupt his healings but yeah hunters , mages , locks are in too .</div></div><hr />

If your Alliance...lol pally, maybe he can hearth out or something.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DruidsRock</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what it is worth Darkelf (i know this thread was started a while ago - so you may have got the bat beeyatch on farm status by now) the guild I am in heavily relies on mass DPS...before she changes, full DPS and we rarely get more than one lot of bats coming in before 50%. When they do come in, everyone with an AOE ability hammers them and they go down in seconds.<br />
<br />
After 50%, it is a lot more fun as I generally get to go kitty form for the attack speed :wiggle: . And yes, it can be generally all about the interrupts, and the prevention of the heal...but if you have a kick ass DPS group anything is possible. She has healed twice and we have still got her down...man that one was intense but great fun. <br />
<br />
So try it both ways, yes the slow way is safer - but everyone knows DPS = FUN :D</div></div><hr />
