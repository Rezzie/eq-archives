<br />
I know that for the longest time, when the Druid population was low, Druids did not usually attack other Druids. I guess it was sort of an unwritten rule or more of a show of brotherhood between members of what once was the weakest class.<br />
<br />
I liked the idea of it so I would not attack other Druids even in a large scale fight. However now days I am finding it near impossible to stick to. As soon as I pass another Druid by the next thing I know its....moonfire moonfire moonfire.<br />
<br />
 This happened once again in Av yesterday afew times by the same Druid so I had no choice but to turn on him and rip him apart. To bad it had to be a Druid but it kinda does your heart good to rip someone apart that has teir2 and teir3 armor peices when all I have is my pvp blue set....hehe.<br />
<br />
 But anyways. Do any of you still try and follow this unwritten rule, or should I just forget it and kill em all?<br />

I try to avoid druid fights, because they're kinda long sometimes. Well, except in the case of Mr. no0bfire spammer that uses up all his/her mana by the time I cast my first heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">watup</div><div class="date">01-12-2006, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i only follow that rule in moonglade becuase there the outisde aspects of the war do not influence us. However outside of it in BG's or world PvP i will go after them. Re healing azeroth, then loyalty to my people and the horde come first. Respect for a NE druid comes last, but a lot higher than any other alliance player.<br />
<br />
The other night in WSG I saw a NE druid in cat form (lvl29) running to our base. Being six levels lower than him i simply hibernated him and was going to leave it at that. However I looked at our score and saw we were down one cap. So i decided to kill him and send him to the GY. Sadly that did not happen and I was killed by him, stupid stuttering bug made me lose him long enough to get a mana potion in, popped to bear and got a couple crits on me.<br />
<br />
oh well, long story short it really depends on the situation.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of alliance who attack no matter what lvl you are and they'll wait until you start fighting a mob before attacking, so I've learned to kill before they get a chance to gank me.  And NE druids do sit higher than other alliance, but they're still alliance.  <br />
<br />
My first experience with this on my druid was in moonglade at lvl 10 doing my bear quest.  A druid much higher lvl than me killed me as soon as he saw me, so my opinion of them didn't start well.  I have run into some respectable ones though.</div></div><hr />

We were both in cat form, i faerie fired him and switched to bear.  He stayed in cat form and tried to &quot;dps me&quot; :iamwithst .  I couldn't believe it.  I guess he thought he could get enough damage on me fast enough to not need to heal, because he didnt even try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? First it's the RP angle (all druids live in peace and harmoney etc) and second, because it's usually a long boring fight (if it ever ends).</div></div><hr />

From time to time if I'm in an area and I see the ever popular &quot;Astranaar is under attack!&quot; I may go to help out, but only being 34 when it's a group of 40s or 50+ I make little impact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've come to hate the horde so much that I make a point to kill everyone I see that is not gray for me. Sometimes taking everyone on is a bad idea ;)<br />
<br />
I tried to be reasonable but I didn't get that back. Now it's all out war! I do cut druids slack. And fighting in Moonglade is very bad manners. Nevermind poor RP'ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I fight for Astranaar on almost what seems to be a nightly basis now and even though I rarely see anyone close to my lvl attacking I know I make a difference in the battle. <br />
As for attacking other Druids, if I notice a enemy using mana then you have my attention! So it's safe to say I will attack other druids in combat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">01-13-2006, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually I will bow to other druids as we pass each other. If they attack, then I do, otherwise I salute and we play the emote game. However if they happen to be attacking a same faction player, they are fair game. I can't let someone on my side die if there was something I can do about it. In instanced PvP I agree with Sildan. Druids are far too dangerous to be left to run around.<br />
<br />
I'll gank anything else silly as long as they are within in level range and aren't clearly doing something important like fighting a quest mob or on an escort quest. I also won't corpse camp or wait until a mob blows 90% of their life. <br />
<br />
I also tend to leave people alone that impress me with a clever name like Nyteshadow (my rogue). Conversely &quot;Ibashyou&quot; , &quot;Stabitystab&quot; and the like get it no matter if I have to burn pots to do it.<br />

I wouldn't leave a druid alone out of respect or PRing, but I tend to only attack outright the cloth wearers (fight the rest for survival once it gets going).<br />
<br />
In WSG I tend to not fight anyone and just focus on stealthing in grabbing the flag and running back.</div></div><hr />
