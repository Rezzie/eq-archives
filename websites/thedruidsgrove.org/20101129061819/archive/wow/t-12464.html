<br />
However, I have noticed that a lot of times I'm slow to CC my target because the target is stealthed/invisible and inevitably chooses to become visible behind me.  Usually we've lost in the precious seconds it takes me to turn around and acquire them (even tho I use proximo)<br />
<br />
It occurs to me that if I can have my (visible) partner position himself just right we can force the stealthed person so destealth in my LOS (I figure the stealthed person will either need LOS on their partner or LOS on my partner).  I've had some ideas for each of the arenas but wanted to pose the question here to see how different people control line of sight in each arena.<br />
<br />
TIA!</div></div><hr />

That will allow you to see them 'through' a pillar, or wherever they are on the map.  Which helps a lot with LOS pillar humping, which is annoying but necessary.  Also, get the Proximo Mod (if you don't already have it), which helps a lot.<br />

If their DPS opens out of stealth on you, that means that your dps is opening on their healer which is a good thing.  Druids have crazy survivability in arenas through HoT's and bear.  Whatever you do, don't get stuck in caster form.  Also, in the legendary advice of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, DONT PANIC :).  Try to save your trinket and NS as long as possible.  If a good rogue sees you trinket a KS, they will immediatley Gouge, head off to your partner, then blind you when you are out of Gouge, immediatley start working your partner again, then right before blind wears off they will vanish and Sap you.  Thats a lot of CC thrown on you while they rip apart your partner.<br />
<br />
Do what you can to CC their rogue (I assume this is what is opening on you that is giving you problems - Feral druids are no where near as hard to deal with 1v1 as a resto druid).  If this isn't possible, remember that you can use feral charge as an escape.  Drop to bear, feral charge their healer, get into cheeta and book it.  Feral charging their healer has the added benefit of another interrupt on them while your dps is pounding away.  At all times, stay max range from your teammate so that if you need to get away your feral charge gives you the most distance possible.<br />
<br />
Also, have your visible teammage be very agressive in attacking their healer if you see that they have one stealth.  If your teammate opens on their healer, the rogue on the other team has to make the choice to save their healer, or continue looking for you in stealth.</div></div><hr />
