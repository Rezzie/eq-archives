roughly a week ago i met this guy and we had a cool conversation and i was pleasantly surprised when he really wanted to give me his number and ask if i'd call him. i decided to call him two days later and left a message on his voicemail. the next day he called back and we planned to get coffee two days later, when he was supposed to get off work early. <br />
cut to a few hours before we're supposed to meet, when i get a voicemail on my cell after coming out of class saying he couldnt get off work early, that hopefully we can reschedule for later that week and he would call me later. i also missed a few things he said because of background noise but i assume it wasn't anything that important. maybe i should've waited for him to call me but i figured i'd do the polite thing and call to verify i got the change of plans. of course, i got his voicemail again so i just said it was cool and he can call me to reschedule later. <br />
that was five days ago and i'm quite confused because isn't it a bit rude for him not to call back especially after changing the plans? or is this whole thing behind us and he might just call back whenever he feels like it? or should i risk seeming desperate and text him and ask what's up? i really wanted to hang out as friends because we had a lot in common.. <br />
any advice is appreciated, thanks!</div></div><hr />

No, seriously, just call/text him.  I doubt contacting him once after five days will make you seem &quot;desperate.&quot;  I mean to me, desperate is camping outside his work every day and waiting for him to get out to talk to him or something.  And even if he thinks that you are, his loss.  Who cares so long as you try?  <br />
<br />
If not, plenty of other fish in the sea.</div></div><hr />
