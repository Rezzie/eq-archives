I was just wonding what the most efficient use of lifebloom is.  Should I keep it stacked all the time or should I stack 3 and let them run off and stack 3 more?</div></div><hr />

The most efficient us mana wise is to stack it to three and then only refresh it right before it runs out.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it works well, but I keep spamming it almost constantly.  I think I can heal just about as good by using rejuvenation, regrowth, and the occasional healing touch when I need a spike heal.  Why is everybody so ga-ga over lifebloom?  Does it generate less threat or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prior to the last patch you were able to pop trinkets and keep it rolling on the tank for the full duration of the fight at the trinketed power. It is still the most mana efficient spell a druid has, even stacked at 3.  Letting it bloom while, nice for little spike damage here and there, removes how efficient as you will have to restack it 3x. On tanks it should never drop, and your spike damage recovery should be from a rejuv &amp; swiftmend, on group healing, it is fine to toss a rejuv, lifebloom and move on to the next target ( depending on your +heal of course ).<br />
<br />
Also, it does not generate less threat, but the blooms do generate threat on the target that it bloomed on instead of the healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Lifebloom &quot;blooms&quot;, the final heal value is the same regardless if it was a single lifebloom or a stack of 3. It's the Healing over time that increases as you stack it.</div></div><hr />

it's just more work to keep the stacks up on 3 targets.<br />
<br />
sure u can heal with regrowth and rejuv.<br />
but i like it that when i concentrate on lifebloom im the unchallenged leader of the healing-meters^^<br />
i dont know any other healer who can heal 1000 per tick(every second) on 3 targets and have the time to toss another HoT on a 4th target in that time. Thats 3k hps (if 3 tanks take damage) + a rejuv every 6 seconds in between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are many awesome things about lifebloom (and some I dont even know about by the sounds of it), but here's a brief summary of why it's super-awesome.<br />
<br />
1.  Mana efficiency.  As has been said already in this thread, refreshing 3 stacks of lifebloom before it's about to expire each time is the most efficient healing output possible.  It means you get 7 ticks of 500+ (about 3500 healing) for only ~200 mana.  This method of using lifebloom is great for using on tanks, and because it's so efficient you can just sit there doing it all day without ever running out of mana.<br />
If there are 3 tanks, you can keep lifeblooms on all of them - bringing great stability to a raid encounter.<br />
<br />
2.  Dispel effect.  If you're pvp'ing and your 5% health rogue is running away from a hunter, the hunter may be tempted to use arcane shot to finish him off.  Put a lifebloom on the rog - now if the hunter does arcane shot, it dispels the lifebloom, causing the bloom to hit instantly - negating the damage of the arcane shot.  You can also trick shamans into helping you heal yourself for loads - when they start spamming purge at you (as shamans are prone to doing), it dispels the lifebloom, healing you.  Put on another, and it gets purged again - healing you again.  The most blooms I've managed to chain together in this way is 5, but usually they figure out what is happening a bit earlier :&gt;  In pvp, it's always best to go with no more than 2 stacks if you think it might be purged.  Purge (and possibly also dispel?) removes 2 buffs per cast, so if you have 3 stacks up it will simply drop it to 1 stack, and this won't create a bloom.<br />

<br />
Btw, you only get 6 ticks of 500 (for me its 700 a tick though when no tree is in MT group) because the 7th tick is the bloom.<br />
<br />
@s3rgio your lifeblooms do not heal for 1k per tick, especially with that idol. But yes, its very awesome healing for a uge amount per second on 3 targets taking constant dmg.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this, with two resto druids using solely lifeblooms ticking at 700 each everage on the 1 target, that is reducing the dps of th eboss by 1.4k dps. Add a rejuv and its more. The best thing about this healing is its instant recovery, and swiftmend is an instant cast for a quick 4k or so. Whereas other classes have to use anticipation healing to get the same results. If they don't do that, its even worse. And the fact you can keep lifebloom up on 3 targets for a very very very long time.<br />
<br />
PS: 4 target lifebloom doesnt allow rejuvs to be used.<br />
<br />
1st target: lb, 5.5, 4, 2.5, 1 or lb, 5.5, 4, 2.5, 1 or lb, <br />
2nd target: .., lb, 5.5, 4, 2.5, 1 or lb, 5.5, 4, 2.5, <br />
3rd target:..., ..., lb, 5.5, 4, 2.5, 1 or lb, 5.5, 4, <br />
4th target: ..., ..., ..., lb, 5.5, 4, 2.5, 1 or lb, 5.5,<br />
<br />
The commas represent a global cd having just passes, and the numbers show how long til a lb (lifebloom) stack blooms. So if you re-apply 4 gcd's after first applying it, you can manage to refresh just on the 1 second to go mark (a very fine split second after is most probable due to reaction and changing target times which gives 6 full ticks of the lb).<br />
For me though this is extremly hard with aussie lag (600ms+) and i usally get to refreshing with less than .5 seconds to go.<br />
<br />
I use this if im bored and have been given a job of just looking after my group of 4 melee dps, i macro it all to the one button and spam it lol. But thats only when im very tired from work and feeling very slack, and they make the mistake of giving me a really stupid healing assignment. But those 4 melee dps will never die :)<br />
