<br />
I did what I normally do in most LDoN's when I am not the MH which is cast my clicky &quot;Tempest Wrath&quot;:  http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3602 ; and then cast Eci's and Winter's Frost.  After casting these, I generally Melee and may cast Winter's Frost again for the kill if needed.  And of course I patch heal as needed.<br />
<br />
I watch my casting in case the MH runs into trouble and I need to take over Healing in an emergency... I want a good amount of mana, just so I will be prepared.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I was yelled at by someone in the group because I was not sitting down and medding.  I was told that Druids do NOT melee.  And that the other members in the group were wondering what I was doing since I was not medding (later found this out to be a lie... when questioned later, no other participant in the group thought this)  Annnnnnyway.  My question is:<br />
<br />
If Druids have plenty of mana, do you think it is alright for them to melee?  Or should they sit and med during fights, regardless of mana.<br />
<br />
I was made to feel like a total noob because I thought that causing dmg with melee would help (every little bit helps) instead of sitting and doing nothing between nukes, buffs, heals etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I am in a healer role I tend to be much more mana conscious and try and hold back mana for heals. In that case I often melee. My hammer procs for some nice damage that can certainly contribute.<br />
<br />
Don't let anyone tell you what your role is. They can either except how you play a druid or chose not to have you in their groups. You don't need to fit into the template someone else has set forth for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see the same group complaining had you chain nuked and took aggro. <br />
<br />
I for one love melee. My weapon does nice damage, it procs more mana for me, and its great fun IMO. However, I wouldnt do it in a setting where things weren't easy (Vxed/Tipt/KT) and I certainly wouldnt do it on raids (ok sometimes if pulling trash) but in LDONS I play offtank and love it. <br />
<br />
So I say if you can handle doing multiple things - keep doing it. Its a game and you should do with it what you like (unless it affects anothers gametime as well - for instance melee when you have no mana and are no longer good to the group).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I need to qualify my amazement by saying that low level druids certainly do and should melee. Once you get to 50+, put away your weapons for good.<br />
<br />
Firstly, you can do more damage nuking (quick fight) or dotting (long fight) than you can ever do meleeing. You gain mana for sit-medding that you don't get while meleeing.<br />
<br />
Second, there are better, non-melee items for the primary slot that will enhance your abilities beyond what a melee item would.<br />
<br />
The only time I meleed after level 50 was when I was whacking pixies in Lesser Faydark for their dust (baking tradeskill). I could kill them faster by hitting them, than casting on them.<br />
<br />
If you want to melee, pick another class.<br />

My weapon has a 320 dd proc on it, not a bad addition to the dot I cast at start of fight, especially if it goes off 2 or 3 times on a mob. I think druids and any class should be able to work on melee skills - but pick your times. I play with a group of RL friends, we have a great puller (Monk) and a really good warrior tank. I find that even taking care of regen and DS and sow/shrew recasts, I still have enough mana to backup heal and even throw an extra DD or two on nasty casters - and melee at the same time. The only skill that isn't quite maxed is 2hb - oh and hand to hand lol but I think I'd have a hard time justifying why I wasn't holding all my gear and only punching for 2 damage.  :shuffle:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wha? I suppose this depends on your level, but I assure you the best druid primaries are very much melee-focused while giving you the benefits you mention. What items are you thinking of? Perhaps you mean at a low level?<br />
<br />
Saw this bumped recently and noticed it had been 2 long months and a weapon upgrade since I had seen it last. Despite the loss of a mana proc, I still melee quite often between casts. Every extra bit helps if you can afford not medding. And I see many times that is the case these days with KEI/VOQ, FT15 being easier to come by, Tribute, bard song, etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
It makes little sense not to melee (if again, you can afford it). Lordon's take on it is pretty dead on...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, you can do more damage nuking (quick fight) or dotting (long fight) than you can ever do meleeing. You gain mana for sit-medding that you don't get while meleeing.I don't think most people would suggest melee'ing INSTEAD of nuking/dotting, but simply in ADDITION to. And there's times when you can't recast nukes fast enough to need to med, especially without pulling agro from the tank.<br />

I had to look hard to find something better than the Hammer of Hours for primary slot that wasn't a weapon.<br />
<br />
(I use a Hammer of Hours myself.  Very roughly I found that I gained about 25 dps using mana from medding, if I'm on a horse, compared to about 50 dps from melee + procs if hasted.  The proc accounted for about 25-30 dps of that.  If I had a different weapon with a smaller proc I wouldn't melee nearly as much.)</div></div><hr />

Ive seen several threads showing a decent amount of a DPS boost from the Hammer - the last parse I saw someone was testing on PoE mobs...and it was an impressive increase.<br />

You don't need to land the hit to proc.. most of HoH's damage is from the proc so it is still a reliable form of DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But honestly, medding for more nuke damage will probably be better for your group.  Druid melee DPS is laughable.  If your &quot;doing ok on mana&quot; then you could be nuking more.  If you can't nuke more, then your group should be pulling more mobs or fighting more difficult stuff.<br />
<br />
The answer to this question is really easy to figure out with a few parses, but let's do some back of the envelope math.  I doubt druids even with very good weapons do much better than about 12 dps (due to terrible ATK scores).  How much potential nuke DPS is being given up by not medding?  Let's assume medding yields about 18 mana per tick (to make the math easy - I think it's actually more).  That's 3 mana per second.  Without any focus effects or AA, a druid converts mana to damage at about a 4 damage per mana ratio.  That's about 12 dps from medding mana.  Add in mana preservation, damage focus, spell crits, spell casting mastery, specialization and we probably talking about close to double that.  So unless the druid is able to melee for 20+ DPS, medding and nuking more is clearly better.</div></div><hr />

However, if we have our cleric friend with us I fight because I know my tank can hold aggro very well.  So I dot, nuke and smack em around a bit.  If we are in a more dangerous situation like GoD I don't melee, because if I end up getting aggro, when my weapon procs repeatedly, one or two good smacks and I am roadpizza. <br />
If I am with a pickup group I sit nuke the first few fights and see how the group works and use my judgement from there.  But when I am main healer this usually isn't possible due to oom.<br />
But I say if you can maintain your mana (and I can) and still melee then go for it!  :thumbup: <br />

<br />
Situationally, sure, why not. Or when you're fighting a mana drain ae mob and you're oom. Or when you're fighting something really magic resistant.<br />
<br />
I don't think, however, it's better to melee than to nuke/dot for DPS, but it's fun to NOT have to nuke/dot/buff/heal once in a while.<br />
<br />
It also depends on your gear. If you have a HoH with proc augs and gear with +combat effects and haste, then you'll do an okay amount of DPS. But the MM blade really isn't much more than a melee toy. I still smack it around some, but mostly I get annoyed that I can't hit a barn door with it!<br />
<br />
I think it's much more fun to be in a group with a cleric and have the cleric melee while I main heal. Gets the cleric out of their normal role and with the proper gear, they can do some nice damage and bashing.<br />
<br />
But never let anyone make you feel like a noob. They were being poopyheads.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">11-07-2004, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally speaking, it depends on what weapon you plan to melee with.  If its a weapon with a large DD proc or a mana sieve proc (assuming that the mobs have mana) then its worth it.  Without a proc theres no reason to melee. <br />
<br />
I was parsed doing over 75 dps with just melee in sol ro with my hammer, thats more then some paladins.<br />
<br />
The best places to melee imo are zones where you cant use a horse.  In xp groups I rarely med through fights because agro / ducking reasons.  In some zones where you can use your horse i melee as well, though I find the positioning on a horse annoying, so it rarely last long.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to answer your question should a druid melee I would say &quot;If the sitution makes it efficient to.&quot; I can't confirm this, but I believe medding increases your mana regan rate by 20 / tick, or 200 per minute.  Assuming you have elemental gloves, summers flame will cost a tad more then that, but for the sake of this experiment lets just assume its 1400 more damage a minute (since its over 200 mana just elitmate mods / crits.)  If you have a hammer of hours with a 150 DD proc aug on it, your doing an average of 1800 damage a minute, so In that case BY meleeing you do 400 more damage, and thats before your actual melee damage, which can really differ upon your gear / buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhyanna</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also believe that if you have the mana pool, done your first round of casting, and you're sure you aren't gonna get the aggro, then go ahead and get in a few shots...why not, it's fun to hit things *evil grin*<br />
<br />
Most of the time, no, I do not melee (i'm usually on main heals, though)... but from time to time, I'll notice a mob that just does NOT seem to want to die and once I do my last round of casts I'll jump in and get a few more hits in...or if snare has kicked in so they're turned away and I'm sure to not get aggro.  I am a firm believer in every hit counts...i have spells AND weapons for a reason.<br />
<br />
Now, with this said, I am by no means uber, but I have what I think to be decent mana (not in an uber guild, dont have uber friends, etc so my basis for comparison might be flawed).  I almost always have kei (c3 on some servers), my own mana spells (mask and cabbage, or 9), I also have a droggie.  A few of my items have mana regen and almost all have mana stats.  It is very rare that (with a decent group) I ever go below 70% mana.  If you're not thrilled with your mana pool then medd'ing is the right thing to do.<br />
<br />
I also agree with one of the posters that if you feel you are a solid druid and you've been playing a while, really feel like you know what you're doing and do it well (and you've never had any complaints before) then blow them off...who cares what they think :)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't let the DPS factor deter me either.  I've seen some pretty convincing arguments on how kick (for those classes that can) is pretty much worthless.  However, every class I play that can kick... kicks!  =)  Like someone said, DPS is DPS.  Who hasn't died to a mob that was 0% health? (Hate that!)

 <br />
If you want to melee, pick another class.<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
I could see someone saying something to a druid like: &quot;if you want to Feign Death, pick another class.&quot; as it is currently outside the realm of possibility for druids to Feign Death. However, it is within the realm of possibility for druids to melee, and telling another how to play their class, when it sounds like they had their responsibilities covered, seems, well, a bit paternalistic and maybe borderline rude.<br />

Its your character and you play it how you want... Don't let someone tell you how to play you, and when someone does, don't let it get to you. Maybe they are mad cause they messed up playing them. Who knows but if you want to melee, do it. As for me i have a shammy and i play it like a druid ( root, dot, dot, dot, nuke) and i love it. All classes i think should get some type of HP/AC buff to go anywhere with cause you never know when you will get aggro and come face to face with death.</div></div><hr />

Admittedly, most people don't have access to those toys.  It meleeing worth it?  Probably not.  Could you do more dps if you weren't meleeing?  Maybe.  Is it your character?  I hope so!<br />
<br />
Do what you want, druids aren't great dps and if that's 100% of the reason you were asked to come to a group then your group should've gotten a mage or wizard or rogue or some other dps class.  I melee in a lot of groups like LDoNs.  We tend to end up pulling 3-5 mobs at once and sitting is asking to get smacked.  Melee dps is a viable way to help keep your mana up if you use it in place of a dot or nuking.  Sustaining your dps is far more important than how much you can cap it at.</div></div><hr />

and a nice damage proc like www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=42083 (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=42083).<br />
 <br />
The most time I melee is when I solo with damage shield and regen.<br />
My augmented weapon yields up to 100 damage with high dexterity.</div></div><hr />

As long as you know when you need to med, heal or any of the other things we druids do without ever being asked,:) I say go ahead take a whack at the mob, if you get lucky you might get the kill shot. I absolutely agree with all those that say play the way you are comfortable, there is nothing more boring than sitting and medding if I don't need to. Have fun, it's just a game after all.</div></div><hr />

I am so old school that I remember way back in the day before druids had truly defined roles, I used to Melee ALL the time. When I made 25, I finally had to hang up the staff and admit to myself that most of my time was going to be sitting staring at the spellbook.<br />
 <br />
However, I still melee every chance I get. I have a fairly new weapon that I got from the 68.1 arc that I LOVE! My group is usually myself, 70 warrior, and 70 cleric. Sometimes, we switch out the warrior for another 70 Druid so most of our fights are root/dot. But I still get up there and club the baddie if I can!<br />
 <br />
I agree with the people here who have said, if you got the mana, and know when it is time to heal/dot - go for it!</div></div><hr />

Also if you get the chanty haste that lets any class crit..(sorry mind went blank cant remember name)  I have had 400+ crits with Greatstaff of Power.  <br />
<br />
I love to melee, and I DoT the mobs up while doing it.  I have maxed 1HB, 1HS and almost maxed on 2 HB.  Only melee skill i haven't really worked on is H2H.</div></div><hr />
