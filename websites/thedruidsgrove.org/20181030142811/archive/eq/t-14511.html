Item Information:<br />
You must use the solvent Class XIV Augmentation Distiller (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47014) to remove this augment safely.<br />
&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;You get this quest from a huge butterfly looking drake Anaglass (is marked on maps) in Sunderrock.<br />
 <br />
I think you kill 10 of one drake and 20 of another.<br />
 <br />
I got 2 ash frost hides to drop (swatch did too) and so it nice for folks who might still need mana regen and hides for tier quest.<br />

You're coming up with some great stuff!  It looks like the Developers gave some thought into quests and gear for us casual players.  :smile:</div></div><hr />

I had to adjust almost 5 augs just to get it to fit in my armor.   The quest itself is very soloable, the seething mist drakes are the rare spawn.  It took me solo about 2 1/2 hours to do it.  I got the 1st 20 drakes down, it was the mist drakes I was waiting on most of the time.  With luck and a full group you could bang this out in 30 mins if the spawns go your way.</div></div><hr />

I talked (hailed) to Anaglass after killing 20 steamers and 10 mistys (with completion messages after each requirement) and no reward selection screen.  Just a message saying I got experience and whether I would like to help further with cleaning up the springs.  I checked my rewards window and there is nothing there.  I've put in a petition but haven't heard back as yet.<br />
<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Namira1</div><div class="date">10-07-2006, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An update on this quest.  I got a response to my petition from a GM who said that he checked around and this is a known issue with the Sunderock Geyser quest.  He asked me to /bug report it so that the devs or whoever works on these things can recreate it and fix it.  I /bugged it but I don't hold out too much hope.  The ticket is now listed as closed and I still don't have the augment =(    <br />
<br />
So everyone beware, this quest may or may not work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">10-11-2006, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok..been looking into this and i found this thread on alla http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3589 you will need to register to view it (its free). 2 different ppl say the task has been nerfed and you need to do the whole task (all 3 tasks in the arc) to get the reward ( each task no longer gives a reward..just the last one). but what i cant figure out is if this is the case then how come trayc was able to /petition for the aug from a gm? i cant get an answer out of sony other than their usual &quot;canned&quot; responses can anyone confirm or deny this? does that first task still give certain ppl the reward? after getting the first task sunderrock springs does preview reward button still work or has it been greyed out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tokkyl</div><div class="date">10-11-2006, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I petitioned this the other day and got a response that you now need to finish all tasks in the series in order to get the reward option, and therefore only ONE option would be available. Their sorry for any inconvenience Blah, Blah, Blah.<br />
 <br />
The problem I have with this is my druid got the task when a reward option was available for completing only the drake kills, but I didn't FINISH the task until after the patch that &quot;nerfed&quot; the reward. I feel if I started the task and a reward was available I should still GET the reward for that character.<br />
 <br />
Now my shm didn't get the task until after the nerf, so he never had an option for a reward and I'm fine with that.<br />
 <br />
I'm going to petition again on my druid since it WAS available when started, but I highly doubt I'll get a better response.</div></div><hr />

The risk vs. reward is substantially worse than for the initial quest.</div></div><hr />
