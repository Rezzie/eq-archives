<br />
Thus far I have 'discovered' transmutation of primal shadow to water and primal fire to mana whilst doing other transmutes.  I cant help but wish the transmutations were the other way, but there you go, that's life.  <br />
<br />
Does anyone know what other transmutations can be discovered in this way?  Eg is there a 'primal mana to fire'?  I've got transmutation mastery - I don't know if this makes any difference to the transmutes that can be discovered.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

Primal Lifes sell for a lot of money as they are used in a lot of healing enchants, spell threads, etc.  Primal Earth spawns abundantly from ore nodes, so miners tend to have loads of them.  Consequently, the price of Primal Earth tends to be quite low.<br />
<br />
On balance, though, if you are transmute master the best possible thing to transmute is Primal Might.  These are worth loads of money and if you get a double, you've earned yourself a heap of money for nothing.  :&gt;<br />

Simple as that.  No discovery mechanism before Outland recipes.</div></div><hr />
