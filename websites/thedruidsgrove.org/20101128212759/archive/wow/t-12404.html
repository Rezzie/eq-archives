<br />
Put two shifting nightseye and a steady talasite in the chest.<br />
<br />
I have a red and yellow slot in the shoulders. Any good sights for reseraching good gems? Or any opinions on what to put in there?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing Sta, Agi, Res., +crit are all good stats to look for...<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">02-19-2008, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I see two ways to go in PvP if I stack AGI + STA.<br />
<br />
So given two red / one yellow slot in the s1 chest:<br />
<br />
+8 Agiliy / +18 Stamina / + 4 Resilience<br />
<br />
or;<br />
<br />
+20 Agility / +6 Stamina / +4 Resilience<br />
<br />
Red gems give no Stamina. Yellow gems give no Stamina or Agility. So in order to stack Stamina w/ a red slot, I would need to go with Purple gems.<br />
<br />
My choice is basically to trust I'll get blue slots later and stack them with STA gems, or I need to go with hybrid gems now and mix STA/AGI as possible. Since Yellow slots give neither, I can either go Orange (Agility / Hit) or Green (STA/Res).<br />
<br />
There really is no way with that configuration to stack only STA and AGI. So wondering which I should stack more and what my 3rd preference should be. I'm going with Resilience for now but wonder if my lack of experience in L70 PvP will lead to make making poor shorterm choices that will have me depleting &quot;Vika's Epic Flight Form Fund&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is the socket bonus worth keeping?  Sometimes they are not.  So, placing +sta gems into a non-blue could be a good compromise.<br />
<br />
Second, unless you are really serious about PvP, you don't have to buy 50g &quot;rare&quot; (blue quality) gems.  You can always get the 2-8g &quot;uncommon&quot; (green quality) version.<br />
<br />
Off Topic: Why is there such a big jump in price from &quot;uncommon&quot; to &quot;rare&quot; gems?  Using wowhead prices, a +9 sta gem is 2g, whereas a +12 sta gem is 50g!  WTF?  Is the 30-40 more health worth 48g?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-19-2008, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.Sorry to hijack this thread....<br />
<br />
I'm still not so sure.  Say you have 10 +12 gems (that's quite a bit).  So, 10*12.5*12 = 1500 health (in bear form) for 10*50g == 500g.  With 10 +9 gems at 2g each you get 10*12.5*10 = 1250 health for 10*2g = 20g.<br />
<br />
Or 250 health for 480g.  480g buys quite a few flasks?  Scrolls? ~10% of an Epic mount? other enchants?  Several days of less farming, etc.<br />
<br />
That said, all of my tanking gear has 50g gems.  But I bought those before I did the math. :lol:</div></div><hr />

Or for those that have the time to generate gold through some other means (professions, AH gimics, etc.).  But, for those that play 1-2 hours 4-5 days a week (that's me.  If I play more than 2 hours in one sitting, it is very, very rare).  Money can be an issue.<br />
<br />
It can also be an issue for those that just reached lvl 70.  Though, I guess they could buy 2g gems at first and then replace them with 50g gems at some later time they see fit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">02-20-2008, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While my playing time is limited due to RL, I am not hording my  money and did splurge on the 50g gems. Which is why I want to make good decisions. I don't mind spending the money, I just don't want to invalidate that decision a day later. Which is why I balked on putting an enchant on my lovely Staff of the Beasts. The price was outrageous and I won't have the staff once I have enough honor to buy the Maul.<br />
<br />
I am serious about PvP. Did the x9's extensively so my class wouldn't seem new at L70. I really feel like the old Bards from EQ. So many things I can do and in almost every situation there's something I can do to persevere. So looking forward to Arenas. Already have a 2v2 (feral druid and SL/SL Lock) and 3v3 (feral druid and SL/SL Lock and Resto Shammy). So the arena points should help.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the food for thought. The socket bonus is  a good point. And once I have my Epic Flight Form, I can't see what I'll use my money for. So I'm just spending it all now as I get s1 gear for gems and enchants. You never know when 100 HP's or 10 Resilience is the difference between a 1 in the &quot;W&quot; column. :dance:</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are just tanking regular 5 mans, or pvp'ing / arena'ing casually (1-2 games here and there), or whatever can be done in 1-2 hours, that extra 250 health isnt that big of a deal imo.  Though that could very much mean the difference between living through an encounter or not.</div></div><hr />
