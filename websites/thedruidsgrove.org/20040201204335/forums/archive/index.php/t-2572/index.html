<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somewhere here someone asked a question again about number crunching some dmg spells and out of curiousity I started wondering exactly how dmg and DPM scale up with all the various mana savings and nuke increasers figured in.<br />
<br />
I can't swear to all the details.  There is a fair amount of uncertainty in the data you get just perusing boards...to whit:<br />
<br />
I have heard that FOM has the same progression as SCF (2,4,7% benefits).  I have also heard that FOM has a much lower benefit than SCF.  I don't know of any certain parses on this point, but maybe I will dig around in Graffe's and figure it out.<br />
<br />
Other biggie is the MP issue.  Is it the full value (as Lucy says) or is it a random 1-x% savings as I have also read?  I scanned a little info from Graffe's about that but haven't really digested it all...the data set in the pages I saw seemed to limited to be reliable.  For simplicity's sake, I used the max possible mana preservation rather than an average of the 1-x%.  That could also be revisited.<br />
<br />
I may have missed some steps in the dmg focus benefit as well (that one I am pretty sure is definitely a 1-x% benefit since it is easy to see, but again I did max benefit for this).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was pretty impressed by how the numbers scale up as you approach high AA and Time level gear.  Thought I would share.  Be forwarned...there are 900 permutations calculated.<br />
<br />
Only did Winter's Storm at this point. <br />
<br />
Also, FYI, my assumption is that chain nuking is approximately 1 nuke within every 10 seconds for the aggregate dmg calcs (dmg over 5 minutes).  Might have made more sense to calc it based on expending a full bar of mana and assuming different mana levels but dunno how much time I will spend on it.<br />
<br />
Also thoguht about playing with the nuke haste AA's and foci, but that would have multiplied my permutations many times over so I didn't bother.<br />

<br />
Everything I've read indicates that Mana Pres. items are random 1-x%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still curious about layering in the haste aa and foci since the question behind my exercise is really how far does power scale up beyond the innate spells based on gear and aa.</div></div><hr />
