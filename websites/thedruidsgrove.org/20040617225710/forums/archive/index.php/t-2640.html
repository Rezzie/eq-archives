<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many posts have been made regarding the mid and higher lvl aa's, but none in the basic AA's.<br />
<br />
Now I only have my first 2 AA's and was wondering where is a good place to put my first six AA's.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Run speed for sure.<br />
<br />
Then you can decide between regeneration and metabolism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BriennaMonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most people seem to go run speed and regeneration first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqduffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think metabolism is better though. =)<br />
<br />
run3, metabo3, if I had it to do over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just curious, why would a druid need metabo? <br />
<br />
I have so much food al the time from autoforaging that I give stacks of food and water to my other toons through the shared bank slot all the time.<br />
<br />
Even with a mount, as long as you force feed yourself the odd berries and roots you forage, you should not wipe out your stat food.<br />
<br />
For every other class, ok, but for druids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No room for a forage hotkey.  Between clickies, /assist, heal messages, pet commands, AA abilities I need immediate access to--combined with the need to have some hotkeys the same on all pages, particularly my assist button--I just don't have room for anything non-essential on my main hotkey pages.  I'm not going to remember to switch to hotkey page 7 and back every 100 seconds.<br />
<br />
Besides, with the long duration food, nearly every time I try to force feed myself I get a message that I'm too full.  It seems there's a small window where you can force feed yourself before consuming more food.<br />
<br />
Also, I tend to go afk for long periods of time (not while grouped or anything, of course).<br />
<br />
It's just nice to only have to buy food once or twice a month, and not have to worry about force feeding.  The money saved by innate metabolism when using stat food fulltime easily justifies the 3 AA's, especially if you spend a lot of time on horseback.<br />
<br />
Now, whether to get this or innate regen first...hrm, it's a tossup.  I'd probably get regen first because, well, I like regen. :P  Must...get...fungi tunic...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">metabolism is nice cause when you pay 100pp per hero sandwich you get like a months use out of a stack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;strong&gt;The Basics&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Run Speed&lt;/em&gt;<br />
<br />
Pros: Great for indoor zones. Allows you to outrun most mobs even buffs drop.  Absolutely necessary.<br />
<br />
Cons: Nobody donates for SoW anymore ;) <br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Regeneration&lt;/em&gt;<br />
<br />
Pros: Gives a small boost to HP recovery.  Nice for kiting or taking AEs.<br />
<br />
Cons: 3 HP/tick is not very noticable, especially for a class that can already regen/heal itself.<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Innate Wisdom&lt;/em&gt;<br />
<br />
Pros: A great way to boost Wis if you haven't hit the stat cap yet.  Each point of Wis adds ~6 mana to your overall mana pool.  Can allow some Wis gear to be traded out for Mana/HP/resist gear.<br />
<br />
Cons: It's pretty easy to hit the initial Wis cap (255) with gear and can take awhile to farm enough AAs to open up a higher cap.  C3/C4/C5 and stat food can also boost Wis a lot.<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Innate Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;<br />
<br />
Pros: Can save a lot of money over time if you carry around stat food.  Especially nice if you spend a lot of time on horseback.  Eliminates hassle.<br />
<br />
Cons: Most stat foods are very easy to make or buy from the bazaar for reasonable prices.<br />
<br />
&lt;em&gt;Tanaan Crafting Mastery&lt;/em&gt;<br />
<br />
Pros: An oft-overlooked basic, but the increasing benefits of tradeskills and availablilty of skillup paths make this a viable choice for the tradeskill-inclined.<br />
<br />
Cons: If you don't like to tradeskill, this will be a complete waste of AAs.<br />

<br />
For your stat-enhancing haute cuisine of course.  Some of it is a real pain to make or expensive to buy.  And your horse/drogmor nibbles at it too.  Also, you can carry less at once and free up more inventory space, if you're not the type who restocks often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was about to reply that I did neither metabo or regen first...<br />
<br />
I had just dinged AA 5 when PoP was released. The week before, Tanaan mastery was released.  I did 4-6 on Tanaan mastery and maxed brewing.  :) <br />
<br />
But then, I do everything wrong. When I built my druid I put all of her beginning points into str (what did I know?)  :P</div></div><hr />
