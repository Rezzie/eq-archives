<br />
pounce, mangle, rake, mangle, rake (until 4 combo points) then i do rip and just continue to attack the mob until it die (spamming mangle whenever the 40 energy comes up).<br />
<br />
im just wondering if ferocious bite is of any good and i should ever use it since i believe its much much more better to have dot(rip) than just ferocious bite.<br />
<br />
thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are going to open with pounce, get an energy bar addon you can can land your pounce just before you get another tick of energy.  Pounce--&gt;mangle--&gt;Shred--&gt;Shred (if ooc prcs)--&gt;Rip (at 4 CP).  Cast FFF while you are waiting for energy (usually after the mangle before the shred).  Use Mangle to get to 4 CP if you don't get the 2nd shred off.<br />
<br />
For weaker mobs (green, low yellows), FFF--&gt;Mangle ('till 4 CP)--&gt;Rip works just as well and can be a bit faster.<br />
<br />
Don't use Bite unless the non-elite mob has less than 20% health and you have 35-39 energy.  Otherwise, just hit mangle again.  Bite consumes all remaining energy.  Sure it can crit for big numbers, but when it doesn't you look stupid standing there with a mob at 20+% health and 4s away from another yellow attack (mangle).<br />
<br />
<br />
FWIW, the only time I found Rake useful was before I had Maim as a way to deal with running mobs.  I'd hit them with rake just before they ran to help finish them off.  Really rake is for &quot;high armor&quot; targets (PvP against tanks, pally) as it avoids armor.</div></div><hr />

sorry but what does FFF stand for?<br />
<br />
and how am i going to pull off 2 shred if the mob is attacking me (i assume the stun from pounce is not long enough.)</div></div><hr />

BI combined with an energy bar addon and Shredding Attacks will allow this.  In fact, I think you might be able to pull off 3 attacks if OoC procs.  This was my standard attack sequence for quite some time.  Even before I had Mangle you could get 2 Shreds off.<br />
<br />
0.0 -- pounce 50 E, but assume you get the 20 right back due to a &quot;perfect pounce&quot; so you end up with 70 E.<br />
1.0 -- Mangle 70-40 == 30E<br />
2.0 -- FFF (50 E)<br />
3.0 -- Shred (8 E)<br />
4.0 -- Pounce Fades<br />
<br />
If OoC procs on the Pounce, Mangle or white damage, it is possible to get off 3 attacks before the mob turns around.  But you won't get FFF off until after he turns around (not a big deal).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember this ONE time in arena, i snuck up on a lock, and MUST have gotten off a perfect pounce... i know OOC proc'd, but the dude was dead quicker than i would have imagined... it was awesome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-27-2008, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Energy Watch v2 or something like that.  There are two versions with similar names (energy watch v2 and energy watch v2 ZZZ).  Take whichever one has been updated recently.<br />
<br />
Not sure about X-Perl, but Pitbull unit frames has an energy ticker, but I don't like (it is hard to see).  So, I have turned it off and still use Energy Watch.<br />
<br />
Make sure you enable the addon for stealth mode (&quot;/ew show stealth&quot;).  Otherwise the bar only &quot;activates&quot; when you are in combat.  At that point it is too late (to use for a perfect pouce).  I also have mine configured to show combo points (using the bar text edit option), so I don't have to look at the mob's unit frame.  The energy bar gives me all I need.  When the next tick will appear, how much energy I currently have and how many combo points I have on the current mob.</div></div><hr />

I had a friend of mine who raids with a retribution pally turn me on to ArcHud.  I do use the one from Wowace.  I like it.  I think its very configurable and it keeps my eyes focused right in the middle of the screen where I need them when I DPS or tank.  It might not be as good for when I heal, but I've become a big fan of having my health and mana/energy bars right there and also having my mobs relative health/mana bars right there as well.  Plus on my hunter I have a small set of arcs that show my pet right visually in front of me so he's easier to remember to heal.</div></div><hr />

I also like to Rake the Rogues to keep 'em from Gouging/Blinding me then bandaging :grin: Definitely a situational skill.</div></div><hr />
