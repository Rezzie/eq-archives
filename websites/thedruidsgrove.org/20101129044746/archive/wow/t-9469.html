<br />
Malfurion Stormrage, founder of the Cenarion Circle (with his father/mentor Cenarius) was dead set against the use of Arcane magic, so much so that he fought against the existing ruling class at the time (The Highborne) and forced the splitting of the Night Elf race entirely because The Highborne used Arcane magic from the Well of Eternity...<br />
<br />
How is it that the Druids now use Arcane magic?  I'm so glad i don't play on a RP server at this point, i'd be completely at a loss what to do as my Druid...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's kind of wierd and wrong.<br />
<br />
Blizzard could have just as easily made those spells nature spells.  Or if they wanted variety they could have made them other types of magic like fire or frost.<br />
<br />
Maybe they weren't thinking - just trying to balance resistances with spell types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-02-2006, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you're saying makes sense but I don't see how it could've been done any other way.<br />
<br />
If a druid was limited to one school they would not have any caster dps tools if a mob was nature resistant.<br />
<br />
For example:  Imagine a Moonkin in Dire Maul (is it west that's all the plant mobs?) or Zul'Gurub.<br />
<br />
I do, however, think it's odd that the entire balance tree focuses on arcane rather than nature.  Of the four damage spells available to us they split it even:  two nature and two arcane.  It's the arcane that get the improvements though.  Nature only has improved wrath, which is not bad.<br />
<br />
Did anyone play a druid in EQ?  Remember the dot stacking we'd do there?  If a mild dot was added to wrath (think:  milder hybrid of scorch &amp; ignite from the mage trees) through talents it'd make Moonkin alot more viable in PvE and PvP.  Stack your dots:  Insect Swarm, Moonfire, Wrath - Then blast away with moonfire (edit:  I mean starfire).<br />
<br />
I see two problems with this, though.  We're a class without overlap, meaning we don't have two ways to do any one thing.  This would give us two initial damage + dot spells.  I also think we'd be infringing a bit on the shadow priests' title as &quot;the king of dots&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">01-03-2006, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that it probably has everything to do with resistances and game balance as opposed to role playing.<br />
<br />
It might be better if they fixed it though, open up a new purpose for us against enemies with high arcane resistance ready for a mage (not ready for Moonkin?)</div></div><hr />

Curse of Agony and Corruption are nasty when stacked.  And they have immolate.  Priests just have shadow word pain, if you don't count channeled spells.  If you do count channeled spells, locks own even harder.<br />
<br />
Druids have more dot's than priests, indeed more than locks if I am correct:  Insect swarm, mf, rip and rake.  I am not sure what you mean about a class without overlap.  Seems to me thats what we are all about, though we go at it different ways...</div></div><hr />

While true, I meant caster dots.  Also, I am a warlock newb.  It's one of the few classes I have not played and the only one no one has really filled me in on.  I /tell 'ed a lock in my guild today that shadow priests were the king of dot's.  He laughed and told me basically what you're saying now.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what you mean about a class without overlap.<br />
The point I'm trying to make is that we usually have to be in a specific form to do a specific thing.  We tend not to get two abilities that do the same, or nearly the same thing.  The exceptions I see are maul/claw and starfire/wrath.  This is in contrast to say a mage - who can single target with frostbolt, fireball, and scorch, or a priest - who can self-heal with that one racial, flash, or greater.<br />
<br />
The idea, though, is to bump down the front end wrath damage and add some sort of stackable dot - stacks like scorch does for mages.  Or, alternatively, add an ability like ignite - does x% of the damage over xSec on crit.  I'm just throwing out ideas to make Moonkin just a bit more viable while still keeping the uniquness of the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-03-2006, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Locks wtfpwn.  I just rolled a ud lock to try them out on one of the new servers, and wow.  They do huge damage from dot's.  With a shadow priest that has shadow weaving on a mob, forget about it.<br />
<br />
I like insect swarm as a stackable dot, not only for the mediocre damage, but because it stacks on a 2% chance to miss.  Though thats in the resto tree.  <br />
<br />
I agree that balance could use a talent like what you are talking about.  Maybe like blinding light or something that if you cast it before you cast a starfire, it causes the target to miss its next 3-5 attacks.  Or maybe some kind of increased damage taken by arcane spells similar to shadow weaving.  e.g. each arcane spell that hits the target increases arcane damage done to it by 3%, stacks up to 5 times.  That'd be cool.  Then mages would love moonkins even more, similar to a lock's love for shadow priests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-03-2006, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That makes sense but you won't find many mages using arcane missles for damage.  It's only really used because it can be talented to be non-interruptable from damage, and can be talented to reduce aggro.<br />
<br />
So mages use it to lead off so they don't steal aggro, or if they're waiting for frost nova to finish cooldown.</div></div><hr />
