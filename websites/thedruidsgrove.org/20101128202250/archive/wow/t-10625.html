I was just wondering (hopeing really) that someone could give me a link (or at least name) to this mod.  I might even consider going Feral (balance currently) if I could find this.  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

TO be honest, I was a fan of the druid in Diablo 2.  A lycan form would really be cool.</div></div><hr />

Now, a wolf form like the shaman's I could see. But a werewolf, meh.</div></div><hr />

I saw the video too and yea its not a trinket but he just changed the model. Personally I dunno how to do it &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

However, changing the model is a global change.  What it requires you to do is unpack the mpq files and then locate the specific model you want.  Change the name of the file to the same as the current druid skin.   Then delete everything else but these files and their respective hierarchy.  DO NOT REPACK THE MPQ as blizz checks for changes to this and will require you to uninstall and reinstall.  Then, if you did it properly, you will appear as a tigon on your screen only.  All other druids that would use the same model will appear as a tigon too.  It's coll for a bit but then gets annoying.</div></div><hr />
