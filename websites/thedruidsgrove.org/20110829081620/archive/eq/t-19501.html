<br />
with my group of friends I have reached tier 4 in SOD.<br />
We have a mage, wizzard, ench, druid (me) and just ditched my 85 warrior for my 85 necro, working with the mages pet as tank and using 1 cleric merc, supported by my druids heals.<br />
<br />
We are stuck at Murduchs Last Stand at the moment and every little bit, especially focus items for nukes, would help a ton. My druid has over 3000 AAs, so the only thing to enhance her damage would be focus effects. The other toons have only around 500AAs each.<br />
<br />
I just noticed that neither Tosk nor Warrens yield any int casters or druid nuke focus items for fire, cold, magic.<br />
<br />
IIRC in FOS there was an item with a magic nuke focus, for example.<br />
<br />
Since I do not have magelo premium any more, can anyone link me a site where I can search by focus effect/class/level or give me any hints where to aqcuire these items? <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know of a site that allows sort by focus, but this site is pretty good for listing all the armor sets and where they come from, and th focus on each slot.<br />

Fire = arms<br />
Cold = gloves<br />
Magic = Helm<br />
<br />
Go work on your visable armor from SoD... get T5 group armor from OBF/Dranik's and you'll have a 55% foci, iirc.<br />
<br />
Or you could also do the OMM's to get brews to buy comparable slots.</div></div><hr />
