I have a decently geared resto druid with +1600 healing and 368 res.  have struggled finding a partner that I mesh well with until I randomly asked for a 2s partner in trade chat and a shammy replied.  We went 6 and 1 last night....we kicked ass.  It was alot of fun but I have no clue how far a combo like this will go though....any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Then again, right now there are so many weird comps with the start of S4 that anything has an equal chance of winning or getting farmed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlock is traditionally a very good choice of partner but ymmv and all that..<br />

Shammys are notoriously squishy and I had a difficult time healing him through the initial burst attack and CCing whoever I was supposed to CC at the same time.  <br />
<br />
I'm with an SL/SL lock now and I'm so relieved...I've got more time to stay stealthed, set myself up in a good position and begin healing and CCing.<br />
<br />
Still if it's going well and you play well as a team, then go for it!  The only way to find out how far you'll go is to play.</div></div><hr />

I actually killed one last night in 7 seconds. Unless they are well geared, its gonna be rough to keep them alive, as shamans are always the first target.<br />

I'm playing 2's on my SL/SL lock right now with a dreamstate / restokin druid, and we're having a lot of fun. <br />
 <br />
Strat involves me running out, hitting my dmg trinket and fully dotting everything (i.e. rolling my face across my keyboard a few times :P) while my sheld is still up (from voidwalker sacrafice), then immediatley fearing their healer (or secondary dps with the most cc potential) while my restokin buddy pops out of stealth and MF / IS and wrath burns down their dps while I focus 100% on keeping the healer CC'd. <br />
 <br />
My druid is having a ton of fun after playing last season as 8/11/42 with a rogue. He says that actually doing something other than healing and running away is a blast, which I can imagine :) If you are playing resto as 8/11/42 with a SLSL lock, be prepared for LOOOONG games. You are the quintessential 'outlast team'.<br />
 <br />
Though still the strongest 2v2 comp is a decked out warrior and a decked out resto druid.</div></div><hr />
