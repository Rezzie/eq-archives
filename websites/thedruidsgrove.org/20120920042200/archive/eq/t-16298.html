 <br />
I am about to try and run the level 68 DODH spell missions so I can get the Reptile Skin spell. (It seems like a great spell), and was wondering if there was a buyable upgrade to it?  (I mean no point running the quests if there is a level 70-75 version of the spell)<br />
 <br />
Also, does anyone have a good full spell-list (that is printable) ?<br />
I have been slack with my spells of late and now I am 75, I think its about time I caught up on all those I am missing.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for your help and time!</div></div><hr />

For a full spell list, I always use Lucy, though it's not quite printable.</div></div><hr />

I stress all my druids to get this spells since it both raid and group friendly on the tanks<br />
 <br />
Once I figure it out I'll send you a list of spells from 61-75 by PM</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as Skin of the Reptile, judging by the pre-alpha information on Lucy (search: &quot;Skin of the Rep;&quot; note:  highly unreliable, but possibly resembling spells for new expansion), SotR will be going from a 120 hit limit to a 10 hit limit, with the healing ranging from 900 - 975 per proc...so, if this trend takes place (probably likely, given mana flare to mana recursion upgrade styles), SotR will be highly useful for non-assbeat encounters.<br />

<br />
So...does anybody on Luclin want to help me get this spell, too? :)</div></div><hr />

I was told that a heal proc should appear on my screen every few secs to tell me the tank had been healed for 600hp blah blah. This does not happen.  I was told by another druid on my server that they nerfed the spell during one of their five billion patches and havent' fixed it yet.  Is this true, does the spell not even work. Feedback would be great as I have many more uses for the spell slot if this is a waste of a cast.</div></div><hr />
