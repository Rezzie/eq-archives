<br />
I never did buy WotLK.  I just stopped, and didn't really miss it, although my druid (and all druids) still holds a special place in my heart. :&gt;<br />
<br />
Now I am working on a new project... a project involving this (http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/aug03/images/culturevulture1.l.jpg).  ^_^<br />
<br />
Maybe when I have something audible to share I will post up a link for anyone who is interested.<br />
<br />

::hugs all the druids!!::<br />

<br />
Also by the thought of cat leap !  Man, I had so much fun with it when the pre-expo patch hit.. :&gt;<br />
<br />
But, I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.  I have a new project to apply myself to.  Watch this space...<br />

<br />
WotLK had the opposite effect for me; I was going to quit but WotLK made it worth staying and each content patch makes feral Druiding even better.<br />
<br />
There is such a thing as a part-time player, you know. Although my OCD nature sometimes obscures that fact...</div></div><hr />
