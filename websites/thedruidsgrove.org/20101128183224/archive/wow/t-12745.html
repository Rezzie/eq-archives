And the Xpac is still months away.  What is Blizzard going to do about all that gold in the economy once the Xpac is released?  Seems like it would make stuff awfully expensive for folks with new toons or those who don't have a ton of cash.<br />
<br />
If they give us some &quot;big ticket&quot; item to spend money on (new mount type for 20K, dual specs for 30K) doesn't that make those &quot;new&quot; features far more unobtainable to new players (or alts)?<br />

<br />
I'm no economics guru, but I don't think players' current pot of money will figure much in the grand scheme of things - mobs in Northrend will probably drop several gold each and the quest reward money could be as high as 50g per quest.  Remember the difference between Azeroth and Outland? :&gt;<br />

i certainly dont like the idea of Blizz trying to force me to use a slow land mount.<br />
<br />
i pay for the game and should be able to play it my way. if i want to fly around or over places initially in my haste to reach the magic 80 then i should be allowed and able to.....it should not be down to Blizz restricting me.<br />
<br />
lol, 50g a quest reward !<br />

i hope they introduce some good new things for us to spend cash on ! i've got gold coming out of my ears with nothing wotsoever to spend it on.</div></div><hr />

I think it will be quite fun really.  Using a ground mount in TBC helped to give me a sense of the vast scale of the continent.  Now that I can fly it seems a lot smaller.  :&gt;<br />

It is a shame we won't be able to fly immedietely, but on the other hand I think it will also make exploration of the new continent a lot more fun.  :&gt;  If we could fly straight away, it would take an hour or two at most to see pretty much everything in every new zone.  That's not really playstyle... when I think about playstyle, I think about what sort of role you have within a battle.  Not having the ability to fly on the other hand is about transportation, although of course it all contributes to the game experience.<br />
<br />
Also technically, we pay Blizzard to put our gaming experience into their hands.  We can yell at them when we don't like something but the only way to truly pressure them into changing something to be more to our liking is to vote with our feet - ie stop paying for an account.  I don't think many people are willing to do that..<br />

I've never seen that mentioned before.  I don't do much to earn money today, but I do have 2K, guess I better start saving so I can have 10K by lvl 76/77.  I hate it when I have to earn money, but once I don't it seems as though I have too much.:grin: <br />
<br />
Using &quot;back of the napkin&quot; math, I think I have earned, and spent, 12K+ gold on my Druid.  And probably 2-3K on my first toon (a hunter that I'll never use again).</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't worry too much about money at this stage.  Levelling to 80 will naturally involve generating a large amount of money.  :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">07-25-2008, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is something to think about....<br />
<br />
We've all spent - and I'm not gonna get into specific numbers because for all of us it varies - but, a LOT of money on our Swift Flight Forms.  Which (and I think we can all agree on this) is a Druid's &quot;Raison D'Etre&quot; so-to-speak.<br />
<br />
So, not only are they going to rip it away from us (hard to swallow, but I'm dealing with it) but, they are going to offer it back to us only if we cough up another boat load of gold???  <br />
<br />
Excuse me, but haven't we played by the Swift Flight Form rules already?  <br />
<br />
We don't need to buy a flying mount, we ARE a flying mount.  So, with that in mind, paying the extra gold to get our can't-live-without ability back is fair in the sense that the other classes have to pay (so why shouldn't we)....but....<br />
<br />
will Swift Flight Form be somehow improved, like other flying mounts for other classes will be improved?  And, if so, surely they can't possibly make it faster, because, TBH I currently fly faster than my Herb tracker can track herbs on the mini-map.  I have to fly, pause, fly, pause. And, that's without my trinket.<br />
<br />
Daft thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grynyr</div><div class="date">07-25-2008, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll be able to use your flight form in BC zones just fine.  Just not in the new content.<br />
<br />
Charging money to &quot;de-ice&quot; your wings or whatever is questionable, but taking away flight in the beginning of the new content makes perfect sense.<br />
<br />
If I had flight form in WotLK right away, I'd probably spend my first hours (maybe a LOT of them) roaming around looking at everything, even in zones that are for level 80s.  Talk about spoilers!<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have zero problem with not having flight in the new zones until 77 or so.  The extra money will bother you depending on how much money you have.  If you have enough, it's not a problem. If you don't ahve enough, its gonna suck having to farm more.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Look at when TBC came out.  You had to level a LOT before you got flight form in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I agree with that.  Really, I do.<br />
<br />
But I'm just having a hard time dealing with having to pay another 10,000g to get my bird back when I've already paid so much to achieve it and endured a quest from hell to get it in the first place.<br />
<br />
Pay to get it back?  OK.  But 10,000g?  Damn.  I find it just a little extreme.  <br />
<br />
And, I will be one of those people with money issues.  At the moment, I'm only half way there.  But, you're right, it will probably not take too, too long to aquire.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention, I've got to go through it all over again with my Shadow Priest (who is worth the effort - she rocks).</div></div><hr />

I cant stand dailys anymore, and flying around mining on my warrior on a slow 'donkey' mount to mine is sooo boring.<br />

I run with one of two builds for raiding (either a deep affliction utilty build that boosts raid dps, or a destro shadowbolt nuke spec) depending on who shows up that week, another build for 2v2 arena, another build for 3v3 arena, and if I'm running 5's that week, I have a different build for that.  <br />

I may cool it on raiding for a bit as WoTLK approaches to save time / gold, but I really want to see Illidan down.</div></div><hr />

regardless of lvl 76/77 ?<br />

still... i'd rather him keep everything and continue to play... he was a PvP god on his spriest, and was getting pretty good with his rogue, too... it's better when you have RL friends to play with, and i only have one left on my server, when it used to be around 10 at one point... :(</div></div><hr />

It seems to me that with the advent of things like daily quests, Blizzard are attempting to give players the advantage over bots.  Farming mobs used to be the very fastest way to make money - I remember many happy hours spent at Tyr's hand following my rog :&gt;<br />
But then bots came along and started farming automatically 24 hours a day, and players simply cannot compete with that.  So Blizzard introduced daily quests - short, easy, but inherently too complex for a bot to figure out.  Now most people get their money in this way, and I think that it is largely there as a way to match the inflationary pressure exacted on us by the bots.<br />
<br />
Banning accounts didn't do much, so Blizzard have decided to play with the economics of the game as an alternative method of combatting bots.<br />
<br />
Bots these days are no longer as good money as they were prior to daily quests being introduced.<br />
