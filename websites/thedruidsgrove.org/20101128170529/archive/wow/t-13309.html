The illusive &quot;w/o family aggro&quot; title is not easy to come by.  <br />
<br />
Along the same lines, I would like the &quot;convinced wife to play WoW&quot; title!</div></div><hr />

World of Wifecraft (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVhwwFHGEFI)<br />

I'm definitely not going for that title, solar... if she WANTS to, more power to her, but im not going to convince her... <br />
<br />
seriously though, i WOULD like to get the Champion title before the patch goes live... all i have left is Malygos... i've tried to out a few runs together in the past week, but they've all been pretty fail...<br />
<br />
i'd also LIKE to get the Twilight Vanquisher title, but I'm not making any effort to do it, so i have no expectations :(<br />
<br />
My framerate drops through the floor when i go into OS25, so i'd be of NO help to anyone im grouped with</div></div><hr />

I suppose, I am probably digging my own grave chasing that one.  One day she'll finally give in and then I will have to help her level forever!  Kiss raiding goodbye!  :)</div></div><hr />
