Will the standard gear that I obtain whilst getting to 58-60 to start BC be good enough? I'm concerned that without the gear that the rest of you all raided for after hitting 60, I'll be well under-equiped and find the BC quests too hard. I'd hate to reach the point when I can get in there to find I'm dieing all the time. <br />
I'm not guilded so I can't get help that way.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How successful you are will also depend on how busy the server is on Bloodhoof you have to wait in line to kill some mobs, it is manic.<br />
<br />
I only raided about 6 times and one had one bit of the tier .5 items and have managed to hit 61, so get out there be a druid and enjoy yourself and good luck.</div></div><hr />

Tier 1 is only supposed to last until 62 so you will be fine.</div></div><hr />

You will get greens and blues from quests that are damn good.</div></div><hr />

I believe there's some guy who's leveling a warrior with nothing but the starting items (used the first grey 2H that he found though) and he hit 60 with just 2-3days /played longer than usual.<br />
<br />
That being said, I leveled my druid without touching instances from level 30ish(RFK being my last until I hit 60). My gear was terrible but I still hit 60 with a 8days/played for my first toon =/<br />
<br />
Idk for Alliance but the Horde (one of the first quests) get rewarded with a nice feral staff.</div></div><hr />

I have also seen a green staff as a random drop with 20+ str, sta, int and 119 AP in forms, so ya dont even worry about gear. Also one of the first few quests I did gave me as a reward a Blue chest piece that is every bit as good as Malfurions Blessed Bulwark from BWL. If I remember right it has 426 ac 22sta 23 str and 17-20agi.</div></div><hr />
