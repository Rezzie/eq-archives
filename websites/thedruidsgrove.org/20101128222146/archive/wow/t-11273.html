<br />
Does int only determine the size of your mana pool or does higher int mean you will do consistently high dmg per cast? <br />
<br />
if you have no +spell dmg equipment can you do more that the max dmg of a spell without critting ?<br />
<br />
to do max dmg with spells do you aim at getting as much +spell dmg gear or do you look at +crit gear ?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

<br />
That will be called white damage since it won't be the actual; damage you do. now lest start with +spell dmg. This is really simple as well.<br />
<br />
(Note: I have been informed that the + spell damage  system has not worked like this since the original beta and that there is a new formula out there for getting +spell damage)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope I could at least help a bit.<br />
<br />
Edit: try this site for the +spell damage formulas http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Plus_damage_and_Plus_healing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Esnea</div><div class="date">11-16-2006, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell crit % and +Spell damage are both desireable. +Damage/healing is the best, because that way your whole arsenal of damage and healing spells are empowered. Druids don't have any talents other than MK to increase crit, but in the expansion there will be a nice 4% crit talent low on the tree, and you could have as high as 9% crit if you picked up Moonkin.<br />
<br />
But as far as gear goes, +damage/healing is the way to go. If you run the numbers, 1% crit gives you about the same boost to DPS as +5 damage/healing. And you will find gear with up to 50 damage healing, and you'll never see more than 1-2% crit on a piece of gear. So for DPS, go with the +damage. But if I ever come across a 10% spell crit piece I'd take that too:P</div></div><hr />
