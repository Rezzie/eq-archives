<br />
I'm new to Wow and currently playing my first character, NE druid. I'm at L50 and looking forward to gathering my Wildheart set for heaing in groups. However, I'm spec'd as feral and have so far been collecting as much +Agi gear as possible for cat and bear which is where I spend most of my time. <br />
<br />
My question after all that: Is it worth collecting the Shadowcraft set for use as feral gear?<br />
<br />
according to http://www.wowwiki.com/Dungeon_Set_1 this gear can be worn by a druid.<br />
<br />
Also, hypothetically, if one were to collect both wildheart and shadowcraft gear, could both be upgraded (to feralheart and darkmantle) with the same quest chain?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

BTW, I did do a search for this question figuring other noobs like me must have asked it in the past, but was unable to find any results...</div></div><hr />

The  upgrade quests goes by class, not armor.....plus it's so expensive to do one that I wouldn't want to try and upgrade 2 sets.<br />
<br />
The Feralheart set has some pretty good stats for a good hybrid druid....so you might look into just getting Wildheart and upgrading.  Plus....if you try and role on Shadowcraft when a rogue needs it....you will make enemies.  If you still want Shadowcraft...just be mindful that it is the only Dungeon set of gear that is wanted by rogues (so if a rogue needs....you might want to let them have it....because you can go on other runs to try and get it for yourself).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was aware that this gear would be very important to rogues and I would have to 'greed' if it was a piece they were lacking. I also figured that even without a rogue in the group, I would have to let the rest of the group know at the begining of the run that I intended to 'need' the shadowcraft gear if it dropped.<br />
<br />
I hadn't even considered the cost of the upgrade, which is a very valid point, but somewhat moot I guess since the upgrade quests are class based.<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />

I'm a feral druid, but I'll take my Wildheart gear over SC any day. We were actually running LBRS earlier, and the Shadowcraft gloves dropped. I think our rogue wet himself..:texla:</div></div><hr />

SC is better than WH for a feral druid wanting to maximize his/her melee potential.  Just like beast stalkers is better for an enhance shaman.  And Dreadmist is the best of the 3 cloth sets for pretty much any of the squishies.  T0 sets are open class for a reason.  <br />
<br />
That said, full SC is not the best way to go.  There are a few pieces which are pretty nice but the others have better substitutes.  <br />
<br />
The SC belt, mask, gloves and pants are all good for a dps set.  There are some very good non set pieces though as well if you can get your hands on them.  Deepfury Bracers, Serpentine Sash, Flamescarred Shoulders, any of the Abyssal Leather of Striking armor, Cadaverous Breastplate (its been a while, I think they made the whole cad set blue now, before it was just the chest).  For tanking Atalai shoulders, Slag Hide gloves, bone ring helm.  Then there is the PVP rep rewards which is a mix of blues and epics which are all very good regardless of DPS or tanking do to decent stats and good armor.  The only downside to these pieces is that they are AGI and attack power.  While the AP boosts are good, there is no STR in the equation so you won't benefit from HOTW as much.  Also look into the Bloodtiger/Primal bat skin sets which are crafted though somewhat pricey because they require ZG rep.</div></div><hr />

I would pick that over the wildheart cowl anyday. If you are feral the only real good piece of the wildheart set is the kilt (and it looks cool). :D</div></div><hr />

In my opinion you can find better substitutions for all the other peices, and they can all be found outside of 20+ man instances. <br />
