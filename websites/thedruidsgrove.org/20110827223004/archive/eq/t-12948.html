<br />
Sorry to all i pestered for info on this, but after the 5th day i was starting to believe it was no longer droped in game, or worse, i was given false info =p<br />
<br />
It does drop in the Orb of Subversion task (Shadowalker #2) Normal ( that I can personaly confirm).  But as stated before, it's like a .0001 % chance to drop.  Drop's off any trash spider mob in zone.  Was going kinda crazy, and was kiting 20 plus mobs at once solo, and with group training group with 30 plus mobs. ( Word of caution here, 30 plus mobs all inc, will make the zone buggy and mobs warp, or worse make you warp onto mobs )<br />
<br />
The XP was great considering all the deaths I ate.  3 Druids in group and 3 other Dotters/who ever was needing XP.  Gain 80 Plus AA's and filled up my group leader aa's to max with 8 over :clap: <br />
<br />
It does Drop, and when it did, I thought my group member was pulling my leg =p.  And out of respect, or fear( Swear I would of gone postal =p ), everyone agreed I got to loot it.<br />
<br />
Happy Camper, at least when it's all said in done.  Makes Stormfeather a cake walk =p<br />

 <br />
Instant clickies castable from inventory are useful against dispelling mobs.  Ture will fear you if you that mask.</div></div><hr />
