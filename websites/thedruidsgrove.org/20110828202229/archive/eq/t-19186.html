Not really, but if you take what is going to be given to Clerics, multiply it by three quarters you probably are not going to be too far off for Druids.<br />

 <br />
druids seem to be the only class not discussing this new expansion (or anything useful for that matter) - I know more detailed info about what Underfoot has in store for Shaman, Mages, Wizzys, SKs, Pallys, Beastlords, Necros..... than I do for my own class - and it's not for lack of searching. <br />
 <br />
Kind of sad to me that essentially all you hear on these forums is whining and complaining about how terrible our class has become and how we aren't wanted in groups and we suck with dps and our healing can't compare to clerics... etc, etc..<br />
 <br />
I'm a newb compared to a lot of you, I'm sure. Been playing a little less than 3 years myself so I don't have all the nostalgia of the good old days... but maybe I'm playing a different game than all of you? I start my own groups - never had a problem getting people to join. I am friends w/ a chanter, so my dps is really nice due to mana-reiterate/twincast auras. But even without that, I am able to heal high end content and do my fair share of dps. Am I the BEST at healing and the BEST at dps? No... I'm a jack of all trades.<br />
 <br />
I love my druid. I have tried some other classes and I just really enjoy the diversity I have with my druid and don't think I'll ever switch mains. <br />
 <br />
But coming here, well, it's really disappointing. I visit other class boards and see fairy consistant posting about information, questions, ideas, etc. Recently (for a while now)... druid information is pretty dead and no one seems to care enough to post much relevant information.<br />
 <br />
It is what it is... I'm sure everyone will all continue crying about everything druids don't have... but I've been checking up on this site for 2+ years now and have yet to find very much useful information for current game play. <br />
 <br />
:curse: Sorry for my rant!</div></div><hr />

I think that most of the Grove vets just don't play anymore, so that information has dried up. I did see we are getting an AE debuff of some sort, and that each class gets a specific weapon also, though not of the EPIC kind lol. Add in a new Shawl Quest of some sort, and I feel Underfoot should be a good expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-27-2009, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was that new group wolf thing, never played with it though.  The shawl quest might be fun, think it had 7-8 steps for the new one after the old one.  There was quite a debate with the 8th step on that quest, as it would be one of the final mobs in the expansion cycle.<br />
<br />
quote&quot;Sorry for my rant!&quot;<br />
<br />
That is fair.  The evocation versus alteration versus conjuration debates were pretty fun.  the debates with necros and druids over who the best soloer was. The debates with other druids on the merits of training your defense skill as opposed to leveling right away, I still laugh about my guildies getting smeared by a mob while I am standing over their corpse taking the hits just fine. The debates with wizards about how close wildfire was to their nukes. <br />
<br />
 Druids were funny like that, there was no one end all be all way to play a druid, we all had our little tricks of the trade, style and flair we had to the class.  You could be considered a good druid on so many different levels to go with that gameplay, never so much as nuking nor healing.  You could get a cookie for well timed evacs, being a good puller, keeping mobs snared down, continually buffing thorns/regens, crowd control.  Changes to the gameplay design had alot to do with those issues, like many druids, some liked it, some didn't.</div></div><hr />

It triggers an effect called &quot;healing twincast&quot; which has 3 tick duration, accepts 2 casts, and does exactly what a twincast nuke would do, but to heals. Works on group heal too.<br />
Unlike any previous nuke it's cast on a PC or pet (but not yourself) and it will apply to that targets target.<br />
 <br />
The DD on it is focusable and can crit. You cast the &quot;nuke&quot; on the tank, and it nukes the tanks target, and then you get in the song window the heal twincast buff. It works for 2 landed casts, so if you duck out of a heal, or get interupted, it does not count that cast<br />
<br />
 <br />
Ok, so that's from the eq station forum...<br />
 <br />
So, I'm confused a bit. It's a blast/heal. You have tank targeted - blast - it dmgs the mob. Then you choose any 2 spells to heal the tank with? Or, as it says it's the same as 'twincast' - you click 1 heal spell and it twincasts it? I thought it was a 1 cast blast/heal. I don't understand what the point of this is other than it may twincast 1 heal... at the cost of a large amount of mana...hopefully i'm understanding it wrong.<br />
 <br />
Anyone have a better understanding of how it works?</div></div><hr />

From what I understand it allows you to do both a nuke and a heal without having to switch target. And because of the twincast heal it increases the heal on the tank.<br />
Whether or not it is worth it I can not say. Players who actually used it are in a better position to do so (and that is assuming it does survive the final days of beta in its current form.)<br />

 <br />
1) A spell that targets the NPC that does something beneficial to its Target (HoTT).  So if Druid's have a DD/Heal it will land the DD on the NPC and heal the person it's beating on.  Considering the amount of agro DD's and Heals innately have...That should be interesting for a Druid's life total.<br />
 <br />
2) A AoE spell that you target on the ground (Green ring marks where the spell will land) independent of a NPC.  Read many interesting stories about this new mechanic, should be interesting if they can pull it off.<br />
 <br />
Can't remember what the other new spell mechanic was introduced or if it was only the 2 spell mechanic's introduced but 3 new spell lines created.<br />
 <br />
Currently everyone has said that the spells were sub-par (their are exceptions) but the *NEW* AA lines are AWSOME!  I would imagine that the Druid AA's are no exception.  I would even go as far to say the spell's are probally going to suck for Druid's and you may have 1 spell worth factioning for (DD/Heal spell sounds very interesting to me).<br />
 <br />
And don't worry about sounding like a whiner.  If you have only been playing the class for 3 years, you definitely missed the Druid's hey-day so you really probally not as jaded as a person like me.  I switched mains about 3 years ago(Well, when ever OoW was released, 4-5 years mabye?) and just recently (last 2 weeks) started burning lesson on my Druid again.</div></div><hr />

The hit points of trash mobs have doubled in this expansion, and there is no change that I can detect in druid ability to deal damage in a solo setting.  That makes this the first expansion I can remember where druids are completely not viable outside of a group - and a group healing role, actually, given weak class dps.<br />
<br />
If you count level 85 toons druids have slipped from 4th place (late 2007) to 8th place.  If you count new level 85 toons since June druids are close to last.  If you count high level toons on the new Mayong server druids are in 15th place - barely ahead of paladins, neck and neck with berserkers.  Druids are 2% of toons on Mayong and maybe 10% of all priests (clc, dru, sha.)  Give it a year and I expect total druid numbers on live to be comparable to those on Mayong.</div></div><hr />

Guess which three classes do not (in the current game) have a strong and/or clear group role and do not solo well with mercenaries?<br />
<br />
Next expansion supposedly does away with the mercenaries as a viable group member, so that will cut the bottom out from under two more strongly solo oriented classes.<br />
<br />
I guess Druid numbers do not show up in the developers' spreadsheets and what is not in those does not exist. It does proof though my statement that a class can not survive in a game when its only reason to exist is the lack of players of another class.<br />
In Mayong players are confronted with the choice to level up a main healer and naturally chose, if they have to go through the effort, to pick a Cleric. For backup healer the logical choice is Shaman over Druid. In fact, on the other servers the same choice applies but there you have a backlog of partially leveled Druids muddying up the numers (so the choice becomes leveling that level 70 Druid versus a new Cleric, and even then the majority of players seem to prefer a Cleric).<br />
<br />
An interesting thing to notice is that if not main healing Druids compete with the group spot of an enchanter. Both classes provide low to moderate dps, and give the group additional security (though I might add that an enchanter does that job a lot better in the current game of hard hitting monsters).<br />

I am quite content with our spells though, we got 2 solid ones, 1 usable for powerleveling and one extremely situational / useless.<br />
 <br />
Of new AAs, as it has been said early we got more levitates than we need, however we did score with group white/black wolf form (mana regen, critical heal/blast +%, and mana preservation).  The recast is different than single forms which is money.<br />
 <br />
Wall of wind is extremely situational due to it currently going through floors, ceilings and walls. (I have never had wind come THROUGH a wall before personally...  mabye a hurricane winds knock down a wall, but not go through it)  <br />
 <br />
Spirits of Nature, our new swarm ability is either a horrible joke, or just an excuse for why Extended Swarm was a legit AA for us.<br />
 <br />
More tiers of Healing Adept/Gift (first time since OoW we get both!) helps out alot with the huge increase in DPS from these mobs.  More tiers of other standard AAs, mana regen, critical blast rate/dmg, etc.  are nice too!<br />

Overall I've enjoyed the difficulty of UF, but I do dislike how our class is increasingly becoming less desired in groups and raids vs. the other classes in our archetype (shaman and cleric)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
No, 12 spell slots aren't enough, sadly - but you can make do with them. Sundew Blessing is a must-have for this expansion. It costs a lot of mana, but is a life-saver. Soloing in this expansion is laughable, but I don't have a problem with that. I have a tight group of people I hang out with a lot, so I'm always welcome in their group as well as guildies - I don't have the &quot;unwanted in group&quot; thing a lot of you discuss, but I'm sure it's irritating.<br />
 <br />
This is a tough expansion all the way around -- &quot;casual grouping&quot; is not likely to happen here. If you aren't level 85, you are likely not going to be spending much time in UF zones. If you are not well geared, you'll be farming Brells Rest for a while getting a full set of armor. I don't see this expansion as being any tougher for druids than it is for any other class. Ok, scratch that, Wizards won't have trouble in this expansion (do they have trouble in any expansion?)<br />
 <br />
I am happy with UF as a whole and content with the heal spells, though I do *definitely* think we are in need of a stronger direct damage spell or DoT as well as a way to restore some of our own mana.</div></div><hr />

Like an advantage to an area, especially if they had done it right with the melee resistant types, warriors and rangers would be kings with their all weapon type attacks particularly on piercing and blunt resistant mobs.
