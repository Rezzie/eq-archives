 <br />
Can anyone tell me what the different power sources do to equipment? I see an icy one for sale with orux, it says it slows you down but increases power of the mind. A growth one that I am assuming gives you regen. I can see a handful more, but don't have the best faction yet. Can anyone tell me what they actually do if say, you have the boots? Or the helm? Or a weapon? I am assuming purity is the amount of the power source it uses as well. Any help on this would be appreciated.<br />

Have a read of that - shows you what they do.<br />
<br />
As far as i can tell - 1 powersource does the same thing , regardless of which slot your item is in. From my understanding, if you have a powersource that does, say, 20hp - you get 20hp added for EACH TBS armour/weapon piece you have.. So if you had 2 it'd be 40hp or 10 would be 200.<br />

Has it been mentioned anywhere whether or not the slot will be utilized in future expansions? (when the charm and aug slots were added, clearly they were here to stay, but this appears to me more specific in use)<br />
 <br />
I am not one to complain about new content... except when it discounts previous content.  Which in my opinion is what introducing new currencies and slots that are not backward/forward compatible does.  Hopefully they will find a use for it that does not require a complete regearing in every new expansion.<br />
 <br />
/rude SOE for giving in to human nature and taking the path of least resistance by giving us more things we dont need because they are easier to code.  (not trying to rant, just stating my unsolicited opinion :p )<br />

Yes, that's correct.</div></div><hr />

It depends on the Purity stat of the item.  If one item has a Purity of 50, then it might get 20 hp added to it, if another has a Purity of 25 then it would get 10 hp added.<br />

I have a feeling this will be used in the future.  Of course, I could be wrong, other stuff has been introduced and then never used again.<br />
<br />
I hope this isn't used again because I don't like it.  My biggest complaint is that I hate expendable stuff.  This forces you to spend time dealing with replacing stuff that has been expended rather than spending your time on stuff you would LIKE to do.<br />
<br />
The second (minor) complaint I have is that so far the power sources all have a negative side to them.  I have yet to see one that doesn't have some minus to something.</div></div><hr />
