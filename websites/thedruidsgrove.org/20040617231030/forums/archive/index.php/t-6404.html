<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I've come back to EQ now after roughly a 3-month break only to find a very unfamiliar force at work in Norrath.....inflation.<br />
<br />
While I was &quot;out&quot; I heard about a couple duping exploits and a few macro loopholes, but those have come and gone many times in the past few years and never really had long-term impact (that I've observed), especially since the advent of the Bazaar.   My question is this:  What do you think is causing inflation in Norrath and why?  What will the implications be going forward?  How has it affected you?<br />
<br />
(Surely some aspiring Econ grad student is looking for a thesis topic ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*grin* In the *other* thread complaints were given about plat farming and selling plat.  Any inflation that exists, exists because the money sinks are insufficient to handle the influx of new plat.  Alternately there may be a shortage of farmers for goods to sell.   One would have to look at where the inflation was(common items or rare items) and the people who were buying those items with what money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Callahad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Really tough question eh eh.<br />
<br />
Imho. Inflation has come from multiple factors. <br />
<br />
1 - the real money market of pp and EQ items has skyrocketed in the last year. Those who make a living out of doing this have purchased the high end items and removed them from the normal market, driving the market price up through quasi-monopoly of the resource. 2- at the high end, items are no drop, and there are no pp sinks left. Even tradeskills are done and accounted for. Thus you find yourself with people having lots of pp to spare, driving inflation up.<br />
3- the recent attention on making RL money has caused a number of players to want their own slice of the pie, and they used the dupes and exploits to do just that. I am sure the problem existed before, but was not used to the extent it is today.<br />
<br />
The casino was imho a solution brought by SoE to this inflation problem, and it might be at that (when it gets back live /smirk)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wyte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What we really need then, is a plat sink that actually benefits players on a daily basis; and one that we're happy and willing to pay for.<br />
<br />
The Casino is not it.</div></div><hr />

Well, there's millions, like 10's of millions, of plat for sale for $$'s on each server.  You might follow this thread: http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=6225  to see why that might cause inflation.<br />
<br />
The other reason is that with all the farming of plat going on, there isn't a whole lot of things permanently taking plat out of the economy.  <br />
<br />
LOL!  My supersales.com has a terms and conditions click through.  That strikes me as ironic.  If you hit no, they direct you to the everquest web site.  <br />
<br />
There is a link that will tell you how much they are paying for platinum. <br />
<br />
Hmm... they took down a lot of the plat they had for sale.  It used to be listed in the 25+ million.  Now they only show various lots totaling about the same on each server.  Guess they didn't want to attract undue attention.  IGE is doing the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>B_Delacroix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a wild idea on this.<br />
<br />
There is no limit to the amount of money in the game.  It is &quot;spontaneously&quot; created from killing mobs or selling junk to merchants.  So I had an idea where somewhere a maximum amount of platinum is recorded.  At no time can the total amount of platinum in the game exceed that value.  Then money would go up and down in value as its rarity changed.<br />
<br />
Monsters would drop less and less since the amount of total platinum is converging on the total allowed maximum.  Destroying money would add it back to the allowable pool.  If someone had the clever idea to try to horde all the cash, the value of things would just change in accordance to what the majority could afford to pay.<br />
<br />
That's a really simple explanation of my idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Good way to kill the game....:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sekira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actual play costs have gone down while the amount of money that comes into the game has increased (or at the least stayed the same).  Many of the plat sinks that were in the game just aren't there anymore.  I know alot of these numbers seem small, but over time they add up.<br />
<br />
  Aego/Virtue/Etc/Symbol : Even the most powerful spells still use the 11pp Peridot.  With MGB/Group versions of the spells, you can hit the entire raid with Virtue or Bot9/Symbol for what, 4 dots or 44 plat?  In the old days a raid of 72 would have cost almost 800 plat to symbol everyone or 260ish with just group spells.  With longer durations and duration enhancing foci you are recasting less too.<br />
<br />
  Coffins : Graveyards pretty much eliminated the need for coffins.  A failed raid just waits 20 minutes and starts over.<br />
<br />
  Pearls : It is very often either impossible (spell disabled) or not necessary (it's easier just to walk/fight there) to CoH anymore.<br />
<br />
  SoFR Recharging : Along the same lines as coffins.  While it may have been a raid saver back in the day, graveyards make it unnecessary/pointless so noone bothers with them anymore.  Even at the increased cost since they changed it to make it really expensive to do.<br />
<br />
  Food and Water : Lots of people used to buy bread and water (or milk and muffins, my old favorites) from vendors.  Now we buy Misty Thicket Picnics, Qeynos Afternoon Teas, Halas Meat Pies, Hero Sandwiches, etc from other players.  The vast majority of the components needed for these are looted or foraged and not purchased so the plat being payed for them stays in the economy instead of leaving via a vendor.<br />
<br />
  The casino (if and when it comes back) should make a nice dent in removing plat from the world.  I also think there should be high-end tradeskill recipies that require EXPENSIVE items that can be purchased from vendors.  Sure, it might make it possible for people to buy their way through some of the harsher runs of particular trade skills, but then that money would be gone.  They can already buy components for trade skill items in the bazaar, but that money stays in the economy.</div></div><hr />

GM'ing Smithing and Tailoring via vendor bought items could reduce plat in the economies by amazing numbers. A great idea and one I agree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aedian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">then there wouldn't be any real difficult tradeskills left.  I kinda like the fact that I had to do smithing and Tailoring without vendor skilling.  It feels like a nice accomplishment when my guild asks me to make something cause there are only like 3 of us with 250 skill in tailoring in a guild of 150 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weoden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I do think that having a buff spell that would be in addition to the peridot buffs that would be more hp/ac and it would cost a ruby.  You could also make the buff draw from the recipients bags instead of the casters bags and you would have to be grouped.<br />
<br />
Consumable trade skill items are probably the best approach.  Potions that are really good for the level you could make them and do not stack with spells they mimick.  This would replace power leveling buffs with purchasing potions that cost the skiller plat to make.</div></div><hr />

  Anyone with enough plat can buy their way to GM smith or tailor for the most part now by shopping in the bazaar.  The problem is that money doesn't disappear from the world.  And I'm talking about 2-3k per combine to get you to the 200 range.  Say 3-5k per combine to 220 and leave the higher stuff the way it is.</div></div><hr />

Those were the numbers I was thinking...5k combines 188-250...only the very rich could do it and it would take a huge wet bite out of those half millionaires to multi-millionaires bank accounts.<br />
<br />
I'm facing a similiar problem. GM'ed everything, done the shawl and earring, have nothing to spend money on. I love shopping in the bazaar - but there's nothing I want or could use. =P And my bank account keeps growing...</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL...at those prices per combine (which work out to 100K per skill up, on average), what you see would be a drastic increase in the prices of all bazaar-sold components for competing combines.   Hell, I'd go out and buy up all the components for the 200pp per combine levels, and sell them for 2000 pp per combine.  After all, it would less than half the 5K cost from vendors, and done in bulk, I could assure some buyers of a supply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kulothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A couple of comments.   <br />
<br />
Tradeskill with purchased components would work but if you implement it they should be expensive,  fail more and not be worth selling.   I know that if I could get tailoring up to 250 with bought components and had the 50K pp to spend it would be worth throwing the plat away rather than hunting the ingredients.  The reasoning is that you are skilling up so that you could get to the level to make the nicer items and just throwing the plat away for the skill ups.  <br />
<br />
Secondly vendor crafts could be bypassed by paying for &quot;lessons&quot; .  You pay the craftsman (tailor/smith/etc) for a lesson with the same chance of success as a combine.  The cost of the lessons depends on what your current skill is and gets more expensive (of course).    Fast track to skillup and a huge plat sink.   With enough plat you could get to 250 in a couple of hours with no Carpel tunnel. <br />
<br />
Another plat sink would be the buff vendors in zones with prices and buffs based on the average level of hunters that normally use the zone.  For instance a KEI vendor and in PoK.   They would charge enough that players would undercharge them but if no player is casting the buff you could still get it at the Overpriced vendor caster.  If the Uber lv 60+ buffs cannot be bought from vendors then that would leave that market open.  <br />
<br />
Hired hunters.  In NQH you have the poachers, why not hire them to hunt hides or other drops for you.   Pay the NPC, he runs around killing what drops your item (or a hired forager for dropable forages) until he gets one.   You would have to pay him in advance and if after x kills he doesnt get one you lost your money and have to pay him to do it again.  Or in advance you could give him enough plat for 1, 5, 10 or 20 kills and in return receive a random number of the item you wanted based on how many should have dropped in that number of kills.</div></div><hr />

I still use good old fashioned water for my drink. It's faster to port to RV and buy it than slog through the bazaar and spend beaucoup bucks on a fancier drink. I also use stuff like griffon melts(among other things) that I make for my food. I know I should use MTPs and such for the stats but I don't believe in spending that much money on food.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you guys BUY food???? for everyday stuff??<br />
OMG, I forage everything I need for me AND my alts. I dont think I have ever actually bought normal food - with the exception of if I know that I am going into a 'no food forage' zone and im a little low. I will buy 'stat' food very rarely when the mood hits me.<br />
<br />
I think I forage roughly 4 - 5 stacks of food and water per play session + a stack of whatever the high end 'zone forage' is depending on how long I'm in the zone. I auto-forage and auto-inventory everything, so I never have to worry about having stuff on my cursor at a bad time. I can't imagine actually paying for normal food...especially when I have the best foraging class in the game :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>harvey the dog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i used to play a MUD back in college (Multi-User Domain) called Nuclear War.  you used to be able to buy all kinds of drugs and they would boost your regen and such.  BUT, the more of a particular lind of drug you used, the more addicted you would become to it and get sick and stuff.  but while you were lit up with alcohol, your health would regen faster, so when you went out hunting, you picked up a couple stacks of alcohol to keep yourself good an sauced for the extra regen...<br />
<br />
but over time, you would need to drink more to keep the same amount of regen, so you would have to upgrade...to pot.  hehe, i can guess you can see where this is going.  so if you dropped off a drug, you could eventually get clean again, but it would take a while, (days in game) and you would constantly lose life every so often while you were &quot;going straight&quot;.  anywhoo...so introduced controlled substance type items into the game, where you can use them for X amount of time for X2 bonus, but then have to deal with some negative effect for a more &quot;game enduring&quot; amount of time to recover.<br />

and sell the drugs on a shady halfling...<br />
