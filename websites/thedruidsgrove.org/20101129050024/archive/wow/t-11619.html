This is ridiculous. There is no reason to even use that talent anymore or care about crits. We wont get crits often anyway.<br />
And reducing Bear Armor? I thought Bear form was supposed to make us tanks. I guess not.<br />
Why did this patch destroy us and left most classes alone.<br />
Why Druids???<br />
Hunters and Rogues are overpowered....they get left alone????<br />
We might as well quit and become Paladins, Hunters or Rogues.</div></div><hr />

Rogues and hunters are both pretty crappy in raiding-PvE at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Largest single heal in the game with max rank HT (resto spec)<br />
2. Comparable (a lil higher, actually) DPS to similar geared Mages, Hunters and Rogues, surpassed by combat spec Rogues, destruction Warlocks, fire Mages. (feral spec)<br />
3. Cyclone is amazing in Arena. Inquire with any Arena player about a well played Arena Druid.<br />
<br />
Some of the rants I'm hearing are due to lack of knowledge with the Druid class. It's as simple as that, sadly.<br />
<br />
Yes, we lost 5% damage &quot;bonus&quot; to our crits. Our crits will still do 10% more damage than an average crit from other classes. Wassup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartidiot</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I said.<br />
<br />
1. Healer.<br />
2. DPS but since you can heal you will usually do that with the lack of healers around.  And really when endgame starts Mages, Hunters, Rogues, Warriors, Locks etc will scale better and pass us up.  Esp with the crappy itemization we have been given.<br />
3. Cyclone may be good in pvp.  PvE?  Lose 1/5 of your group in a 5 man for CC or sheep and DPS for 25 seconds.  Hard question.<br />
<br />
Druids will be alright but things are not all rosey like you try to make it seem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not worried about the armor or health nerf.  Tanking isn't about armor anymore as much as defense and resiliance.  Especially and mainly in heroic dungeons.  Being uncrittable is an absolutle must.<br />
<br />
I'm just interested to see how well I can hold aggro, though I'm not QQ'ing.. yet.  I have yet to see the extent of the damage, though like I said, I'm not that worried.<br />
<br />
Most groups that I run with love a druid tank for many reasons.  Improved LOTP aura is insane.  In my experience, Druids tend to be better, and more aware tanks, as (most of us) have experience healing groups:<br />
<br />
We know how much it sucks to be aggro'd on when healing (so we watch our healers backs), we know that usually when cc is broken, the first person the mob goes after is the healer (so we don't swipe around cc'd targets), and overall we have had to work hard to become acceptable tanks with a good reputation.  Well, at least those of us that were feral pre 2.0.  <br />
<br />
Good druid tanks will still be fine.  The new-comers that thought &quot;OOH IM A DRUIDBARETANK warrs l2p&quot; post 2.0 that got by on pure damage alone will be weeded out.<br />
<br />
And all in all, if you still wanna tank, the instances are still 5 and 10 man.  If you are in a guild and they will no longer let you tank, gquit.  If you are pugging, start the groups yourself.  There is plenty of opportunity out there to play the game how you want.  Not like when  you had to run with 39 other ppl with defined class roles in MC, BWL, AQ40 etc pre BC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bear tanks are still going to be fine.  Lots of druids level feral while warriors level arms or fury.  Many, many people prefer the druid specced for tanking over the arms/fury warrior (who may or  may not have an up to date shield).  <br />
<br />
No one can argue that druids don't make good off tanks either.  They are arguable better at tanking everything except for the prot warrior who outgears the bear.  Those are very, very rare and when a group needs a tank they are going to take anythign that tanks.<br />
<br />
Sure the mitigation was nerfed and the damage output of bear was toned down, but it's not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
And don't worry about those dps classes.  Most of them have their own issues since they are competing with each other to be viable in a group (since they all do damage there isn't a niche for them).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I was talking with my friends about last night. With all the DPS out there and the main bulk of instances/raids being 5-10 man...they will be a dime a dozen and there will be way more groups with tons of dps looking for tanks. Druids WILL be tanking into the 25 mans, guaranteed...there just won't be enough &quot;well geared&quot; warriors to compensate for the massive amount of runs that will be taking place. More groups, less warriors = more opportunity for beartanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with most of what was said about the opportunities for tanking instances.  I've always seen LFGs where they need tank and healer.  There is way more dps out there than anything else.  So they are always looking for more tanks.  We'll be nerfed a bit, but it means we need to tank smarter than being able to mash the same few buttons over and over again.  I've looked at the damage meters.  Druids are too good right now.  I've tanked instances where I edge out the ranged dps where I used to get a fraction of their damage output.  We put out a ton of damage and healing at the exact same time.  Masters of nothing but surviving and beating the odds.  Druids I think will still emerge as really good tanks if you take the time to learn the trade and earn a great rep.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite the opposite actually, I pointed out things that you over-exaggerated upon. It's actually not as &quot;bad&quot; as some of u make it seem.<br />
<br />
Druid DPS being surpassed when end-game starts? You mean assuming everyone is decked out in the same Tier set? I suppose we'll see when we reach that level of play. However, u did say &quot;what does a Druid offer now?&quot;, and right now, our DPS in raids are on par (higher than most) with other DPS classes.<br />
<br />
Itemization has been wonderful for Druids, ever since BC came out. There is an abundant supply of leather gear for moonkins who want to make use of their ac bonus (as opposed to cloth wearing moonkins), plenty of feral weapons and dps leather gear shared between rogues/feral druids, and easily obtainable +healing gear (comparable to naxx gear statwise). Ok, I have to agree that itemization for bear tanks aren't that great though. Hopefully someone from Blizzard will take notice of that.<br />
<br />
No one said Cyclone was useful in PvE, in fact, I stated in another post about how Cyclone sucks in PvE. It's more of a detriment to a group, when u hit the Cyclone key without telling anyone. We're definitely not a strong CC class indoors, that's for sure.<br />
<br />

1. Healer.<br />

I'm less concerned with this nerf than what will happen in a month or two when all the raid guildies will be decked out in their uber-gear.  /sigh</div></div><hr />

I don't remember when they buffed it (2.0?), but I certainly don't remember thinking anything of it when I read it in the patch notes.  But tranq really is a wipesaver now.  They boosted the healing a TON on that spell.  Its gone from worthless to usefull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">04-23-2007, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, but since it's now such a long cooldown, and it's pretty much only ever used to save people's bacon in PvE, nobody complains.<br />
<br />
I was DPSing in Arcatraz last night, but busted out Tranq on a couple boss fights and both times got a happily surprised reaction from the party.  &quot;Oh **** oh **** ohhh... wait.  Yay!  We're gonna win now!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Califus</div><div class="date">04-25-2007, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids offer lots to groups :)<br />
<br />
Just the other day, me, 2 prot warriors, enhancement shaman, and a holy pally ran an instance.  W/ full buffs from warrior / shaman / pally  and /w Shamanistic Rage proccin my AP was in the 2.8k's and I was doing 40%+ damage of the entire group.  Not to mention the amount of healing that was done to the shaman's and warriors that were healed by my aura, and the DPS increase to them as well.  I was a madhouse of pain for any monster who turned his back to me (42 nrg shreds anyone?)<br />
<br />
And anytime we were getting in a tough spot (which was often becuase of lack of CC, but thank god for pally heals) I could innervate the pally, bring someone back to life, Tranq for massive healing around the table, heck even toss a few heals myself, and finally offtank mobs attacking our Pally when the warriors couldn't.  Point is, without a druid in that group, it wouldn't have been possible.<br />
<br />
And I bring this to the table in EVERY group that I am in.  If you play a &quot;kitty&quot; druid, you are a one-minded beast and are too parallel of a player to really embrace the class and be an outstanding player.  Think about being a mage, and only using fire spells.  While you'd still be good to a certain point, you would not be using 100% of your class'es tricks that make you a force to be reckoned with.<br />
<br />
Kinda got off on a tangent there ranting myself, but if you think Druid's don't get any love... go check out the Shaman forum at wow.com.  They def have some problems that need fixin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">06-04-2008, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there a class that doesn't think that Blizzard hates it?<br />
<br />
From a hunter point of view I'd say Blizz loves ya, we got our boost to fear beast nerfed to keep druids happy ;)<br />
<br />
I know know, hunters are supposedly overpowered too but I really don't get the &quot;Waaa we're crap compared to a rogue, a warrior and a priest&quot;, well yes, in some respects you are but as pointed out above try asking a Priest to laydown some heavy DPS for a bit.  Biggest problem with Druids is their flexibility, most people don't play a char that can do multiple things so see a druid as a weaker tank, a weaker healer, a weaker DPS character rather than thinking along the lines of all the anecdotes in this thread.<br />
<br />
I'm still fairly new to druiding, but I love it in 5 man groups where that flexibility really comes into play. Not tried 10mans and beyond with it yet, but is this perhaps more where you're likely to be pigeon holed as a &quot;weaker&quot; DPS/Tank/Healer?</div></div><hr />
