If putting out an awesome talent worthy of spending 41 points on and bringing druids on a raid because of that spec then changing it so that it does less dps than a trained ability isn't worth complaining about, then what is?</div></div><hr />

GG blizz.. you almost made ferals viable to raid guilds.. but you screwed us over. GG getting ferals in endgame.<br />

I'm so mad right now. :(<br />

I mean.. it's a F*CKING 41 talent. AT LEAST make it count. :( :( :(</div></div><hr />

That's a considerable nerf :(   I've seen the screenies of it going off in beta before the nerf, I mean, it wasn't UBER damage, but it was awesome considering what we're used to and its spammability... great for holding aggro and actually dpsing in cat form without only relying on shred.  Now it seems... not that great, especially considering where it is in the tree.  :/</div></div><hr />

I have also seen numerous topics on the official WoW General and Druid forums but never found numbers. I thought it was something minor but on paper it looks like a major nerf. As long as we aren't gimped I'm okay with it :)...but then again, I never experienced it's true potential.<br />

On overshot on Blizzard's part in trying to achieve some balance? It seems to me that we're going balistic over a change to the amendment to the unofficial version of a beta trial here. I think I'll wait until there's something official before I get too worked up. The last time I looked there wasn't even a blue post on the WoW druid boards addressing this change. My suspicion (wild hope?) is that we're not done yet.</div></div><hr />

My opinion of that is: so what? It's ok for other classes to have overpowered abilities/builds but not the second-class citizens that feral druids have become? So while a nerf might be justified, it seems like they have carried it way too far and made the 41 point feral talent about as useful as the two other druid 41 point talents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">10-20-2006, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said.<br />
<br />
/Aplause<br />
<br />
Lets be honest.Blizzard has always thought of druids as nothing more than a failed experiment.We have not recieved nearly enough attention as other classes have and that is after almost two years. Think about it. If you go to any druid thread, you can trace requests for more feral orientated gear or simple skill changes that would help a druid become what it essentially is, a choice class.At the momnet we have lots of choices:<br />
<br />
1)Be a good healer and mediocre Feral<br />
2)Be a good healer and mediocre Balance<br />
3)Be a excelent healer and crap at the rest<br />
4)Become feral/balance and suffer getting into a raid guild<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Now people may say that if a guild has enough druids , they let some do what they will. I say that it is true but it comes down to two things:<br />
<br />
1)The guild has enough druids. (Hard to believe on most servers)<br />
2)You have proven yourself as resto and deserve to do what you want to do. (Then when the other druids do badly they ask you to spec back to Resto anyways)<br />
<br />
In closing.<br />
We have but one choice on a multichoice class.<br />
Seems contradictory, doesn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">10-20-2006, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every end-game on my server screams after more druids. Noone is playing druids anymore except some hardcore resto ones and a very few lucky feral/balance that have a nice open-minded guild.<br />
<br />
Everyone else kinda just got tired of being forced to be a primary healer and rerolled.<br />
<br />
True story. :(<br />
<br />
BTW, I agree with Falloraan.. So what if it was overpowered? It's not like a 41 feral is gonna be a master at any other tree? He/She won't even have NS FFS! And even if Mangle lets a feral be on par with a rogue in raid-DPS.. LET HIM! A rogue still has many skills a feral can only dream of.. vanish/stuns/blind/poisons/better feint.. what does the cat have? A crappy cheap shot, a gouge that costs combopoints and erhm.. claw/shred. woopii-freakin-doo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">10-20-2006, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think if Mangle hit for more than shred, cost less, increased your dots by 25%, and could be used from anywhere around the person...it was a bit overpowered. As is, its pretty easy to just about kill any class if you have decent feral gear and knowledge of how to beat them. (the exception being your trinket popping mages that hit for 2k a pop)</div></div><hr />

For rogues, Mutilate is going to replace Backstab. Why shouldn't Mangle replace Shred for ferals? As for you killing any class, have fun with that until the expansion comes out.<br />
<br />
EDIT: My bottom line is, a druid that spends 41 points to pick up Mangle should be able to do more DPS than a druid that skips it. And from all the testing going on right now (see this thread (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=35975737&amp;sid=1)), that's just not the case.</div></div><hr />
