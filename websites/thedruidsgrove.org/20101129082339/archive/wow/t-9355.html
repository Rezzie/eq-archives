Could I take my druid, and a rogue and mage and just us three run through without having to hunt every damn mob?<br />
<br />
<br />
I can never get 5 people together and by the time I do there's always another 5 people running through it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only times I've done WC was with a full group 20+ or on farm mode.  I wouldn't recommend trying to do it with less than a full group before level 24ish, you might be able to do a sneak attack with just druids and rogues but I'd recommend 2 of each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I got 2/5 pieces of the Fang set too!!!!  I am sick of being aggro'd by shamblers.  Every time we go for a boss I get one and 4 lashers run up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me at my new level 21.  A 27 rogue and a 16 mage.<br />
<br />
I pulled with wrath and moonfire, demoralizing roar, growl, and then lots of mauls.  Bash for enough time to pull off a regrowth and rejuv at end.<br />
<br />
Between me doing that, and the rogue took care of the caster mobs, we cleared the entire thing in about an hour and a half.</div></div><hr />
