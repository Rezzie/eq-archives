<br />
I'm trying to fix a friend's laptop that's had a weird graphical problem since the 2.0.1 patch.  Everything in the game is white, with the occasional outline, as if everything's foggy.  We've upgraded the graphics drivers, etc, but can't seem to fix it.  Has anyone else seen this or got any ideas to fix it?  He's ready to quit the game if we can't fix it, which would be a terrible shame.</div></div><hr />

And I assume the the &quot;etc&quot; includes removing all addons, and if that won't work erase whole WoW directory and reinstall everything from scratch?</div></div><hr />

You might try renaming or removing the &quot;WTF&quot; subfolder in your WoW directory to reset to default configuration.<br />
<br />
There's also a file check application you can run (I can't remember the name offhand, it's in the WoW directory) which will tell you if anything's been corrupted.</div></div><hr />

My best guess is they've changed the way fogging works in-game ready for some of the new content.<br />

We've tried a clean install, and also a copy from another PC, so the game is intact.</div></div><hr />
