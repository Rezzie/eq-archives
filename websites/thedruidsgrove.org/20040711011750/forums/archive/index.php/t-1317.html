<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accretion</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here goes.<br />
  <br />
*stands up*<br />
<br />
I'm a card-carrying member of the BDC.  Like many others out there, I loved my Druid 1-49.  That enjoyment gradually gave way to Bitterness after a long time languishing in the 50s, being non-essential to any xp grouping, helping precious little on raids (especially ones with multiple Druids) and watching my &quot;unique&quot; Druid abilities given away to other classes at an alarming rate.  Meanwhile, Verant's message to us was &quot;Caster Balancing is due to happen REAL SOON NOW.  Oh, and don't petition.  They're such a hassle to read&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Well, Verant did gradually start to address Druid needs by implementing the PoTC quest, dropping the healing penalty and adding DoT stacking  (so all those lfg Druids could now group!).  I was starting to have a lot more fun in Norrath again.  <br />
<br />
Then came the 9/4 patch.<br />
<br />
I had never been so discouraged playing EQ and came very close to retiring my Druid (and my account) in sheer despondency.   The PoP spell previews soon followed and provided no solace - just more of the same ol' same ol'.<br />
<br />
Well it's been a few weeks now and I must say that I'm beginning to have fun again.  I've just dinged 60 and spent my life savings on Moonfire, which allows me to be a decent (not great) nuker.  Our new heal allows me to be quite useful in xp places I couldn't touch two weeks ago.  I'm much more useful on raids now and have even been ASKED to help out (never thought I'd see the day).  Our recent PoP revisions have been mildly positive and quite honestly, I'm excited about PoP even though I know it will mean several weeks of technical and balancing headaches.<br />
<br />
I guess all this is to say that I'm moving my BDC Membership Card to the back of my wallet (still keeping it, mind you) at least for the next 3 weeks ;) <br />
<br />
To My Fellow BDCers:  I still acknowledge that we have issues and would love to see us get some NEW and UNIQUE stuff in PoP, but the bottom line is that the game has changed for the better for my Druid.  We're certainly not top-5 material with this &quot;balancing,&quot; but I can contribute significantly to groups and raids again, and for that I'm extremely happy.<br />
<br />
So, uh....I guess....um...thanks Verant?  Heh, wish I could've said that LONG ago.<br />

Don't want to have to renew it a few months after PoP comes out and it takes me ten seconds to heal that buffed tank up for a bubble of health. ;) <br />
<br />
On the other hand, things are looking up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm waiting to see if they are going to make it so HA doesn't work with TR either. Also, with the way clerics are going on about NI's new upgrade I expect that to get nerfed.<br />
<br />
As a side note, I still don't have much of a role on raids. We have so many clerics that TR isn't needed, patch heals are..which is now a cleric/paly's role. <br />
<br />
<br />
TR is great for groups though.</div></div><hr />

TR was a nice start on our healing balance but still does not address our issues from 45+ as a healer. /sigh<br />
<br />
Guess I can heal well from 1-40 and now 58-60, anyone 40-58 is just SOL I guess.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">betina</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can be happy with TR for a few more weeks, but when PoP is out, I think we will be seeing druids kicked back down by the necromancers and mages in terms of usefulness. <br />
<br />
I think part of your joy may be due to the fact that you are now L60. L60 is a good level for Druids, but it wears out quickly. <br />
<br />
I will always be a member of BDC for giving druids a pet... at level 55... which is only level 25...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firemynd</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to sound greedy, but I think druids still *need* a group heal for raiding balance. I've been on several raids since TR went live, and can say without a doubt that I still use Chloroblast 95-99% of the time on raids for groupmates and others who need an emergency heal. Especially when dealing with ongoing AE in high end fights, a 10 second heal doesn't do anything for us.<br />
<br />
TR is a good GROUPING heal to sustain a main tank versus average mobs. We still lack a solid RAIDING heal to sustain groups versus AE mob damage and one to provide quick but effective patch heals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grolmn</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, VI's recent views on not making AAs work on certain spells makes me hold onto my BDC card.  HG not working on TR is dumb.  If a druid spends AAs to crit heal, then by golly all heals should be able to crit.  SK's Soul Abrasion SCF fiasco is assinine as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are actually fixing the SCF Abrassion thing..it's on the dev site today. SK's made them see the light and VI is answering. To bad they won't comment here on why our healing aa's aren't working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really to renounce my BDC membership, Verant needs to do a few more things and some of them are quite critical.  First, TR needs to be fixed - HG should work on the heal, there is zero reason why it shouldnt as the heal is based on CH code which works with HG.  Second and more importantly, TR's cap needs to scale from level 61-65 up to a 5k or 6k cap (depends on the max hitpoints tanks can reach in PoP).   Right now, TR can heal around 40-50% of a tank's buffed hitpoints on a raid and it is far from a replacement for CH, but it does a good job for what it is.   However, if the cap isnt raised in PoP, we will be casting a 10 second spell to heal only 25% of a tank's hitpoints in PoP which wont nearly be enough with the harder hitting mobs and AOEs.<br />
<br />
The other major issue I have is with the new nukes.   Druids have always been about nuking along with backup healing.   However, the new PoP nukes in their current form arent really an upgrade, it reminds me of Moonfire back when Luclin was initially relased when it did 1100 damage, 450 mana ;p.   The current druid nukes arent &quot;big hitters&quot; like the level 65 wizard nuke which allows the wizard nuke to be a poor mana ratio (ie, 2700 damage for 800 mana).  I can understand that Verant does not want to make the new nukes more mana efficient than the Ancient druid nuke to make the ancient nuke still valuable in PoP.   However, the level 64 fire based nuke isnt even an efficiency upgrade over Moonfire (Summers Flame is 1300 damage for 370 mana 3.51 efficiency vs Moonfire 1150 for 320 mana 3.59 efficiency).  Summer Flame should be reduced to 340 mana for 3.82 efficiency (or do 350 mana for 3.71 efficiency) and a clear upgrade over Moonfire, and a nice nuke for those who havent been able to get the Ancient nuke, which most druids wont.  Then Winters Frost could be 350 mana giving a 1395 damage/350 mana ratio of 3.98 (ancient nuke would still be 4.12 efficiency and better overall for efficiency).  However, if Verant doesnt like giving a non-ancient nuke for around a 4 efficiency (*cough* clerics), then they should make Winters Frost into a big inefficient nuke, ie, 2000 damage for 625 mana (3.2 efficiency).<br />
<br />
Finally, give clerics a group symbol at level 65 so the new druid Blessing spell will be wanted.   If Verant does not want to do this, change blessings into a single target version as I dont see many groups wanting this spell.</div></div><hr />
