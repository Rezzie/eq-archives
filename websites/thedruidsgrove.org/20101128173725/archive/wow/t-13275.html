<br />
i was just wondering if its only unique if i tried to have another with the same stat - <br />
<br />
ie : i could not have another one with AGI, but i could choose another one with Spirit ?<br />
<br />
ie one for use as feral and one for use as caster/healer ?<br />
<br />
What do you think ?</div></div><hr />

there are better caster-trinkets IMO<br />
<br />
BTW: I'm going for the card too right now. Have 5/8 and invested about 2600g.<br />
After a long conversation with a seller i had him down to this when i buy all 5 cards he had. :dance:<br />
And a guildie has another 2 (hope to get them for 500g a piece)</div></div><hr />

<br />
that was a damn good deal s3R - they still go for more like 1k a piece with the Ace higher.....<br />
<br />
ps. : you never answered my actual query about unique ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
the badge-trinket is better IMO: [The Egg of Mortal Essence]<br />
Equip: Increases spell power by 98.<br />
Equip: Your direct healing and heal over time spells have a chance to increase your haste rating by 505 for 10 secs.<br />
<br />
and u can go sartharion (with no adds, 30min time needed)<br />
to get [Majestic Dragon Figurine]<br />
Each time you cast a spell you gain 18 Spirit for the next 10 sec., stacking up to 10 times. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
i know!  :rolling: <br />
<br />
<br />
ps. : you never answered my actual query about unique ;)<br />
<br />
i think u can have 2 cards equipped at the same time.<br />
the cards have a different item-ID so it should be no problem.<br />
(but ofcourse i dont know what restrictions blizzard has programmed into it, so not sure if it is possible)</div></div><hr />

<br />
but that wont benefit my oomkin dps as i wont be casting heals ?<br />
<br />
i need to look at badge rewards - have not yet cos not running heroics. plus i'm not sure i'll be looking at oomkin rewards as i still see oomkin as my offspec not main spec so badges would be getting nice feral items.</div></div><hr />
