<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1) Paw of Opalla.  Man I put a lot of time in Upper Guk for that last piece.  It was also my first major achievement in game, and at the time it was a great item.  Otherwise epic but it was a bit anticlimactic.   Without going into uncomfortable details lets just say the day I was scheduled to finally get my last piece, I rushed home, logged in, and a pal said &quot;look in your packs.&quot;  Time waits on no halfling.<br />
<br />
Corallary: Happiest piece to get recently was my seru ring, which I waited and prayed for.<br />
<br />
2)  Longest worn.   Definitely Epic.<br />
<br />
3) Item I most look forward to replacing - Elysian arms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>FireCaller01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">1). 8th shawl followed closely by my epic<br />
<br />
2). My Warden Symbol of Tunare (without which I would have never been able to solo the elysians in UP for a ton of upgrades), I quested it at lv 24 as soon as I could cast wolf form to keep those pesky brownies from rocking my world.<br />
<br />
3). Ring of Thunderous Spirits or Skeeter Mask.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Feuille</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1) What item were you happiest to get (raiding/camping)<br />
<br />
Elder Spiritist Arms.  Was my very first time in KC.  Was my first piece of Kunark armor.  I was incredibly thrilled, especially as the group I was with was almost as thrilled for me.  Was a good day.<br />
<br />
2) What item have you worn the longest.<br />
<br />
Jboots.  I don't use them often anymore but they were great to have, even for a druid.  Great rescue in the old days when you couldn't stack snare and root and sow would drop.<br />
<br />
3) What item would you like to replace the most.<br />
<br />
Crystal Enervated Armband - Love the FT2, but hate the negative to all saves.  LDoN will finally get me a reasonable shot at new arms and some FT2 to put on them.<br />

<br />
Well just recently I got my Mask of Conceptual Energy (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=9444) on a random roll.  Numbers were 1 1000 and wouldn't you have guessed it - I rolled a perfect 1000!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1) What item were you happiest to get (raiding/camping)<br />
Manastone....stil have it today - Got it when it dropped.<br />
<br />
2) What item have you worn the longest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Alyn Cross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1) What item were you happiest to get (raiding/camping)<br />
     I was giddy with power when i obtained my Elder Spiritists Tunic, Epic, and 8th Shawl.  It's a toss up there.  My ES Tunic was one of the first couple i knew of on the server, the 8th Shawl (possibly 1st) as well, and my epic was practically gifted to me from all my friends, who were tired of me not finishing it (friends demanding your presence 'cause they are doing something for YOU and you alone is a pretty cool feeling)<br />
     So yeah, toss up.  Tunic, i'd say, if i had to decide, cause it was first of those 3... but i couldn't sleep for hours after any of them.<br />
<br />
2) What item have you worn the longest.<br />
     Hierophant's Cloak.  It's old.  It's still one of the best available, if you don't have a lot of merit to spend on one.<br />
<br />
3) What item would you like to replace the most<br />
     Boots.  I've never had great boots.  They either lacked wisdom and mana, lacked hp and stamina, or lacked more than 15 combined wis/sta and 80 combined mana/hp... never had great boots.<br />
