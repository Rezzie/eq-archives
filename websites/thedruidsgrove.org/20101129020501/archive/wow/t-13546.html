<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elventra</div><div class="date">05-11-2010, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">last night a few of us ran another guildie through Forge of Souls with one of his newly levelled to 80 alts. Just before the first boss, on one of those big skelly guys the battered hilt dropped. Every one saw what it was straight away and a sudden silence decended over the ensembled group.... every one wanted it of course. No one new what to do. It was quite an interesting moment when you analys it. One of the group in a unsure voice asked if we should all need on it. I suppose as the run consisted on a guild officer (me) and our GM leadership and guidance where the order of the day. So I jumped in and said yes every one need if you want it... (who wouldnt, i mean its worth 10k gold on our server let alone the weapon if you want that).<br />
Any way. We all rolled. Most of us where pretty sure who was going to win. One of our guilds members has a title given to him by us, we also are considering petitioning Blizzard to get him a title created called &quot;the lucky&quot; because he wins every thing. I dont just mean he wins all the best stuff, i mean he is damn spookily lucky. Infact we think he might be a blizzard employee..... no one is that lucky. If you combine that with me... Elventra the unlucky... oh yes yin and yang, for every action there is an instant and immeadiate reaction. You get the idea! He was sure to win.<br />
So we rolled.<br />
It was suprising even in the middle ground around the 50's until i rolled 100!!!!!<br />
<br />
Woot!<br />
<br />
OMFGWOOTWOOTBBQ! I won the battered hilt!<br />
<br />
Elventra &lt;--------- very big cheesy grin!<br />
<br />
I also went on to win a book of glyph mastery and papas brand new bag as well as those bloody daggers the first boss drops every other time im in there.<br />
<br />
Once we had finished the run most of us logged out. Being a sunday and most having work commitments plus being in england we are an hour behind most of europe. This just left me and another druid online........<br />
<br />
Any way. I thought i would start the quest line, apparently it is rather long. First i had to shoot of to the argent tourney grounds. Just south of there is a ring of stones. When you are on the hilt questline there is a group of NPC's one of whom is your hand in and next quest. He sent me off to the wyrmrest temple to speak to Krasus one of the red dragon kin and a key player in &quot;the day of the dragon&quot; book about the freeing of Alexstasza the dragon queen. He sent me to dalaran to speak o a mage up by where you trade in your emblems for nice goodies in the alliance quarter. That mage sent me on a quest to get a disguise so i can enter the horde quarter and get a book. I was keen to get that far as i have explored all of dalaran exept the horde quarter. When you try and get in a guard teleports you out as soon as you pass by. Any way. I went to see this guy doing his laundry on a balcony. He had one of those get me this before the time runs out type of quests like the ones in sholazar for the booze, and the daily in the apothocarys place. I had to gather the laundry items he wanted. Any way, disguise got and then book and explore of the horde quarter done... i was sent back to the tourney grounds again. This is where the quest gets harder (ish) the first instance i am sent to the pit of saron. I have to gather these special stacks of saronite. 5 in total. They glow and are dotted around all over. You then need to kill the first boss and get his hammer and then use one of the forges to make the blade for the hilt.<br />
As i said earlier there was just me and another druid online. So we decided to try and 2 man the Pit of Saron on normal. He had a tank spec and although my tank spec is better than his, (he tried it but does not like tanking where i am main tnaking guild runs) i have a healing offspec. So he tanked and dps'd mobs. We stealthed passed all we could. The first boss took about 8 mins. But he went down. I got my hammer and made my blade. We then decided to try the second boss. Ick and crick. That took also a looooooooooooong time but we got him down as well. I even got a new pair of healing boots out of it<br />
any way, it was midnight by then, (1am for my friend) so we decided to call it a night. We will go back and try to 2 man it all again just for the fun of it. I handed in the quest to the guy outside the instance and he gave me the next step. Forge of Souls. I will need to kill the end boss in there. And do something in his room.<br />
<br />
I will let you know what when i do it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elventra</div><div class="date">05-11-2010, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well. I got to do a quick guildie run to forge of souls. We took down the last of the 2 bosses in there, i cant remember his name but he has by far the best NPC voice in the game... and for me this large glowing goblet type thing appeared. Used my baled on it and quest done. Stepped out and joined up with the rest of our guild to go back and see how far we could get in ICC 10. we are just starting in there so learning the tactics. Any way we got down lady deathwhisper and wone the gunship battle, both of which are guild firsts for us. So we where very happy. ...... any way once we called it for the night a few of us hung around to let me do the next step of my battered hilt quest line. The part that takes us to halls of reflection. This bit is easy enough. You dont even need to do the instance. The person on the quest line just runs forward to arthas' sword and an NPC appears giving you an earbashing for brining the blade into the instance. Then a floating sword appears that needs tanking and DPSing down. Once that was done i looted it and we ran out. Done. That does it for the group stuff. I handed in out side the halls of reflection again and was sent of to the long forgotten isle of qual thalas... or something like that, so off to outland, shattrath to be precise and then through the portal to sunwell plateau. The guy is outside the instance and he gives another quest. Talk to the guy next to him and he ports you inside. I used the blade on the hugh glowing colum of light.... more NPC chit chat and im done. Fortunatly just as i was about to run out and make the long journey back to the argent tourney grounds to hand in and claim my prize i noticed a portal to dalaran. Yay! That saved time. I flew over to the argent grounds and now im the proud owner of:<br />
