Some amazing info I've already started shopping for some upgrades!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is an EXCELLENT Chart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SuburbanLife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the best chart I have seen so far for high end leather! Sucks to have to stick around in takish for RGC then move onto this for some sweet items though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TryonB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Would be nice if you could preserve augmentations.  Even if it cost 1k+ for the solvant to preserve it, it would be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guk sucks enough I'll stay away from it, rather save up like 2x the points for a piece from somewhere else.  orrrr just rather stay in takish for the dots and RGC.<br />
<br />
Wait.  No.  RGC can blow me.<br />
<br />
New dot yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arkturus D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Info from the chicago fan faire.  You can spend your points at any camp you just need to do the required amount of adventures in the specific camp so the vender will show you the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think that might be a common misconception.  There are two different sets of points. The points you are awaraded for unlocking vendor menus and the points you spend.<br />
<br />
Your spend points can be spent anywhere.  The points you earn to unlock vendor (the non spendy type) are never taken away ever.<br />
<br />
Friend of mine was afraid to spend 600 points on Vegence of Tunare afraid she'd go back down to 300 on the merchant vendor lists and thereby have to earn 600 more for an item she wanted. Not true.  Once they show you the goodies, you always have them available as an option.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tiniane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is a copy of a post I wrote for another message board - seems appropriate to reproduce it here:<br />
<br />
Think about points in terms of two different concepts - Favor Points and Advanture Points.<br />
<br />
Favor Points are per camp, and your Favor Rating is the total number of adventure points you have earned in that camp. This dictates the price of the items the Adventure Merchant in that camp will show you (and therefore the price of the items you may buy). Your Favor Points will only increase, they do not decrease when you spend Adventure Points.<br />
<br />
Adventure Points are the points you earn by successfully completing an adventure, and may be spent in ANY camp.<br />
<br />
Here's an example:<br />
<br />
I have completed several adventures in Everfrost and Butcherblock. I currently have 200 favor points with each camp. This gives me 400 adventure points to spend at the Adventure Merchants. As my Favor is only 200 in each camp, each Merchant will only sell me items up to 200 Adventure Points in cost. However, I could spend all my 400 points in either camp. So I could head over to Everfrost and buy a 200 point item and two 100 point items, thus spending all my adventure points. However my favor is not forgotten at either camp.<br />
<br />
If I now head over to North Ro, and earn myself another 200 adventure points, I could then head back to Everfrost or Butcherblock and spend those points there, as I still have the Favor I earned there previously...<br />
<br />
In summary, adventure points determine how much you can currently spend, favor points determine the maximum item value a merchant in that specific camp will sell you. You can lose adventure points (when you spend them), you don't lose Favor points.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loralin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One thing to note about the high-end leather armor (and plate as well) is that they forgot to include graphics for it when they released LDoN. &lt;img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=&quot;:o&quot;&gt; <br />
<br />
I've been told this is already fixed in test but till the next patch I'm a skelli full time at raids (/hug AoN).</div></div><hr />
