So far no lock it's all feral or more restro.(sad huh) having raised several feral druids I'm kinda well burnt out on that spec and seeing my friend tyrn loving her boomkin I decided to try it out. So far here is what i have come up with for a spec http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?5140223125031351310510000000000000000  0000050320300000000000000<br />
<br />
any advice and info would be most welcomed and appreciated</div></div><hr />

Doesn't have to be amazing but don't respec (this goes for all specs) unless you have a decent starter set. Really difficult to get gear when you have 0 to begin with.<br />
<br />
I'm no Balance-Whiz but I see many moonkins with Omen of Clarity from the Resto tree. Maybe you should consider it too. Clearcasting = happy.<br />
<br />
ps. gwmort i miss you (sry, your avatar was the same as his..he was also a balance fanatic)</div></div><hr />

I have moves the points from imp moonfire and brambles to subtley. Now I'm no theroycrafter but im thinking( corect me if im wrong) that with full points in intensity and dream state i should have some good mana regain wich is good seeing 99% of my damage it spells.:mage01: <br />
As for Omen ill see but i dont think ill be hitting much with my wepon less im oom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowlady</div><div class="date">12-03-2007, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You honestly will hit alot with a weapon just because i have noticed being in moonkin that you starfire will do major crits if you have decent gear which unfortunately pulls alot of aggro. I personally never used natures grasp because most instances are indoor so it seems a waste. <br />
And with intesity and dream state you pretty much can throw spells through out a whole fight because your mana builds back up so fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deuce199</div><div class="date">12-03-2007, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using omen of clarity is not a best bet for moonkins, unless you want to be a meleekin, there is no point for it, as you are supposed to be casting from a distance and use your weapon sparingly.<br />
<br />
I would put points into subtley, to dumb down some of that threat you get from casting during groups and raids. Don;t want to pull the mob away form the tanks, I know I do it alot in lower level instances.... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a point left over so if u can sugest a home for it I'd be very thank full also any other info would be welcome to this boomkin nub</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">12-03-2007, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really wanna go for a strong DPS build 2 points in Balance of Power are really important. You will never get spell hit any cheaper than that. It also allows you to focus your equipment on spell damage and crit.<br />
<br />
So I'd put the one point you have left over into that, and find another point that I could move there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also about gear what should i shoot for gem and gear wise other than primal intent <br />
secondly I'm rolling up a boomkin double on a horde sever so what stats should i look for for low lvl char</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">12-03-2007, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just curious..what are is the +crit and +spell damage on a decently equip lvl 70 moonkin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-03-2007, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question would then be, &quot;How do you define decently equipped&quot;? With ~200,000 honor, you can buy full season 1 &quot;Wyrmhide&quot; plus rings, neck, S3 bracers, belt, boots, trinket. (to give you an idea of how much work that is, I knew a druid who got 40k honor, once, one weekend. It was a long weekend. So figure at least 5-6 solid weeks of doing nothing but living, breathing battlegrounds).<br />
<br />
If you mean gear you can get from heroics/kara, that gets kinda fuzzy. Like, do you willing wear cloth or just leather? Do you focus more toward crit chicken (superhigh crit chance) or boombird (super high spell damage)? In general, I'd say lazer chicken is the hardest spec to get decent gear for, so use the pvp gear as a 'baseline' and anything better than that is 'very good' and anything worse than that is 'meh'.</div></div><hr />

um, whats a lazer moonkin? and what is the gear type needed for it</div></div><hr />

Dila means that Moonkin is harder to get gear for, than resto or feral.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">44/0/17 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xcrzicsguVoZxMIL) for raiding, imo.<br />
<br />
Reason being that it'll get you all the damage talents, and balance of power is far more important than the extra point in Subtlety, as nifty as threat reduction is; you can be careful on your threat regardless of gear, but you can't make your spells hit more than your hit rating allows.<br />
<br />
And all of the terms used were for balance: Lazer Chicken, Boomkin, Doomkin, etc.<br />
<br />
I agree with previous posters, though. Gearing for a moonkin is quite tough, as most of your gear will be badge or honor bought, and even then, I'd wager a lot of the cloth gear is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skorpid</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mm ok, but why did he say &quot;crit chicken(superhigh crit chance), boombird (super high spell damage)...&quot; <br />
<br />
Are there anything special that gives them that name? Like by spec, or something? May you be kind enough and give me an example of each spec?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">01-03-2008, 11:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That'd be based upon gear, as in focusing on spell crit or spell damage. Druids going balance usually pick up all the damage increasing talents, regardless.</div></div><hr />
