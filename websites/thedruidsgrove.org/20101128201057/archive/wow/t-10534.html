I was healing at the time.  I can't shapeshift out of this sheep.  Anyone else get sheeped while healing in Scarlet Strat and can't shapeshift out?  My shapeshift keys are dimmed when sheeped there, but I keep getting party chatter telling me to shapeshift out of it...??</div></div><hr />

If you're in animal form, its true that you can't be polymorphed.  But if you're in caster form, its fair game.  Its magic.  It can be dispelled but don't let noobs tell you what to do.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I don't see why u can't shift out of a poly in Strat live, unless Blizzard flagged the spell incorrectly.</div></div><hr />

I gotten entirely too used to using Travel form to break poly in BG's for the minimal mana cost... when you get indoor it doesn't work.<br />

If not, I'd petition it... I ran Live Strat over the weekend, but didn't get Poly'ed at all myself.</div></div><hr />
