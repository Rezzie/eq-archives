<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mappy Sassenfrass</div><div class="date">12-12-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if it's ever been done before, but for my final epic fight, we killed the spawned Faydedar with three people...me, a 62 cleric, and an uber 65 warrior.  Not too surprising really, but just thought I'd mention that it can be done easily with the right characters.<br />
<br />
In fact, I didn't really do jack in the fight.  I landed two heals, but the cleric ended with 40m anyway-and he tried a few nukes (that didn't land).  However, we were using buffs from my alt enchanter.  So it was really two people, with buffs from two more.  In fact, the tank was two boxing the cleric.<br />
<br />
Before spawning Faydedar, we put 8 or 9 junk buffs on each raider, buffed with KEI, VoG, and GRM, and cleric and druid buffs.  The tank had two different insta buffs things he was using to keep his  buffs up.  His important buffs lasted the duration of the fight (a few minutes).  The cleric had a horse, and some FT (not sure how much).<br />
<br />
Neither me nor the cleric could land any damage.  I gave up trying to dot after three tries or so.  Fay was not debuffed at all the whole fight.<br />
<br />
For those on BB, the tank was Zeniff, from Ring of Valor...thanks again Z!</div></div><hr />

I've been wanting to 1 group him but for some reason no one will allow me. Damn chickens.<br />
Nowadays anything more than 2-3 groups is overkill imo.<br />
<br />
Grats on your epic btw. I got mine a few weeks back after giving up on catching the real fay. :P<br />
<br />
Ciao for now!</div></div><hr />

This flat out isn't true.<br />
<br />
We ended up having fifteen people, but it was MASSIVE overkill. He's unquestionably an easy one group kill, if you have a group capable of doing a mob in PoV or PoS you can easily take care of Fay. Anyone above 60 took little to no dmg and I didn't see anyone getting feared, the healing job was a joke, seems the much feared Faydedar has become yet another gimp mob.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even lose a half a bub of health this time..  last time I had to heal myself a couple times to avoid dying..</div></div><hr />

Saw another thread where Uluump was done by less than 1 group.  Now Fay... VSR isn't that hard now either.  I may actually get a leaf blower some day :)</div></div><hr />

What levels?  I have a cleric friend that I might be able to talk into going down there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danaere</div><div class="date">12-30-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Ulump over the weekend with my husband (65 ranger) and our poor abused level 55 cleric-bot-dorf. I did absolutely nothing the whole fight! Just stood there and looked ravishing (at least my husband says so). Think it took 3 cheals? maybe 4. He ran at 19% hp. Kept having to turn attack off so he wouldn't die in a tree or something. :evil: <br />
<br />
Some guildmates of mine did Faydedar with one group a couple months ago before PoP ~ but I think we had 3 or 4 manaburn wizards in the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We did it tonight with the following,<br />
62 monk (me)<br />
61 druid (me)<br />
61 shaman<br />
61 bard<br />
<br />
None of us are in a guild or uber my any means but decent gear for our levels.<br />
<br />
Was easy and no one was close to dying.  Bard was definately the key, the ae's were probably greater than 90% resisted or uneffective so was basically a melee fight.<br />
<br />
Bard used puretone disc and everyone's resists were over 250 in fr/mr. Never got feared and didnt take much damage from ae nuke.<br />
<br />
I mini ch'd with druid and ended fight with 80% mana still with kei.  Shaman was unable to land slow so he used pet and spot heal.<br />
<br />
Just some more data on what you might need to take him down these days.</div></div><hr />
