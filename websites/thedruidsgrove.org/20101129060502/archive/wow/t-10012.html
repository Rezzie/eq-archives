<br />
Even though the score was tied when I left....it was by far the most fun I had in any WSG!  Being able to run with other druids who can catch up to ya to give that much needed heal while you are FC is so nice.  We had an even mix of resto and feral druids.....it was great!</div></div><hr />

There is something beautiful about a pack of 3-4 druids storming up the ramp to the enemy camp in travel form.  Let alone a flag recovery team that can stealth up to the roof and pounce, ravage, and bash the flag carrier, without warning, then if he does manage to run stack 3-4 MFs on him.</div></div><hr />

*single tear rolls down my cheek* Most beautiful scene I could ever see. Sadly, I found that I was usually the only druid on my side (Horde, of course!) in lvl 40s BGs.</div></div><hr />

I decided to go ferral(I normally go support) I was stealthing around killing cloth wearers and it seemed like every guy I went after 2 other druids would go after the same guy we would kill him in one quick shot and re-stealth. The funny thing was we weren't communicating we just kept going after the same people out of a coinky-dink.</div></div><hr />

If you havent already try to find and dowload the video of the all druid raid that killed Onyxia. It was very cool to watch, especially seeing 10-20 druids all in cat form doing dps. I wish i had a link for it but sadly i do not. All i can remember is getting in from filefront. If i find it i will link it on this site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your opponent is really heavy on D with 5+ in the FR (like our Horde farm team likes to do), both of you stealth into position, one waiting on the second floor or somewhere out of sight. First druid grabs the flag and draws them as far down the tunnel as possible, while the second druid gets in place. When the first druid goes down, second grabs returned flag and goes GY exit. Also, if you are alliance and there are several shaman in the FR, I like to hide in the little room between second floor ramp and second floor ledge, buff up with Thorns, MotW, Regrowth, Rejuv, Abolish Poison and then right as you jump down use Free Action pot. By the time they get around to purging your buffs down to to your potion you are outta the FR :)</div></div><hr />

My running gear is just a lot of health/armor and resistances (no DPS whatsoever), and yes, including ring of binding. 8)<br />
<br />
We have two druids (or me and our main PvE tank) as runners where the first one takes the flag and the next one waits stealthed and is ready to jump down and grab the flag as soon as it respawns (as many of the opposite forces are busy running back or similar). We use teamspeak and report where we are so healers can come and meet us when we come runninf or follow behind us.<br />
<br />
So far we are the best WSG team on our server. The Horde teams (wich are much better equipped than us) have really no chance, and they usually just sit down in the flagroom doing nothing if they see they are up against us so we can finish the match fast.</div></div><hr />

Here is how to stop a druid though.  (even if they have a Free Action pot).<br />
<br />
Hunter uses scatter shot. Rrogue then blinds druid til effects of potion wear off.  Then DPS druid down.  <br />

**PS.  I HATE this combo.  Usually need a warrior to run into flag room fake taking flag or fear them.  Then druid grabs flag and runs.<br />

DPS a druid down with a rune of free shapeshift and 14k armor/7,5k health AND 2-3 dedicated healordins running to meet him? Melee is a pretty ****ty tactic aganst a dedicated runner druid. Hunters and rogues can't really damage him/her fast enough. Physical damage doesnt really hurt him.<br />
<br />
Nah dude. Don't work. You can't really DPS a runner druid down. You can DPS his healers down.. but that is also a dead project.. best thing is to take the flag yourself and hope his bodyguards will try to hunt you down. But best, best thing is to not let him take the flag at all. ;)</div></div><hr />

Once I figured out it was the same guy I started to watch his tactics more.  He always ran out the front and down the graveyard side.<br />
<br />
So when I see he picks up the flag Ihustle to that part of the field, moonkin up and go stealth, then he runs right to me while I am invisibly casting hibernate, and out he goes.  Shortly thereafter I root, and by then the rest of my team is on the scene.<br />

He has people out looking for me now, so it doesn't always work, but he still runs the same pattern, and his caps are way down from what they once were.</div></div><hr />

Druids are hard as hell in WSG. Tip:<br />
He has probably used more than half his mana when he comes with the flag.. make him pay for every shapeshift he does! Some ppl use the rune of shapeshift here, and it really sucks.. but still.. make every shapeshift count!<br />
If he's having healordins with him.. remember, they CANT run as fast as him. He will, sooner or later, run away from their healing range.. (root him, spam frost him, do whatever..he WILL run OOM sooner or later).. DONT try to DPS him down.. he's prolly equipped with mastah running gear.. every effort you make to try and kill him is like 20% effective (armor, resistances, overall druidness).. try to separete him from his bodyguards.. then you can wear him down..<br />
<br />
But.. as said.. don&#180;t let him take the flag in the first place. :D<br />
<br />
Theirs a reason why druids are so popular as runners. We are EXTREMELY hard to CC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were up against a team last night with 4 druids!  Man that was rough.  2 were on offense, stealthing in for our flag, and 2 were on defense waiting in the flag room stealthed because it looked undefended on my track humanoids, but before I knew what was happening I got pounced and the MF spam started raining down while I was getting shredded.<br />
<br />
I rez at our graveyard in time to see the other two go running by with the flag, one shifting out of my team's attempts at cc, the other dropping rejuvs, 2 of my team got rooted from NG trying to hit them as they got away.  It was an ugly match.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That brings up a good point I wanna make too...what's up with this game and its add-ons? I've read other people speak of this as well...why should this game be so dependent upon add-ons? How many people actually run their game w/o mods? One might argue you don't really need add-ons to enjoy the game but look at all of the 'hacks' available for things. Just when do the devs say enough is enough and outlaw 3rd party progs? One of the very few things I actually applauded EA for doing with UO was make it illegal to use any 3rd party, non-approved progs - IE. macroing devices, spell progs, etc. <br />
<br />
When do you draw the line between a fair program and a hack?<br />

I agree Goa.  I was actually referring to when you (as a druid) are trying to solo the flag catch yourself.  Ie, you got into a stupid pug group.  If you have healing / support you are golden...just run it home for the cap.<br />

<br />
Ehum? Don't know what teams you are up against, but I seldom get the chance to use cheetah at all.. cat sprint or bear is the only way I run really. Only if the path to our tunnel is totally cleared from infestation I dare run in cheetah. But usually I'm too busy getting hammered. :D But on second thought, cheetah flip/flop is possibly the smartest way to counter all freezing going on.. So, nevermind. :p<br />
