<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a feral druid but to give me a bit more flexability to my 5(+) man group I was thinking of specing 2 points into nurturing instinct to give me the + healing on agility items. The idea is I could act as a ~backup healer depending on who is logged in. <br />
 <br />
In terms of a starter gear set I figured I would pick up the 5 .5 vendor bought PvP set since it would be quick and easy. Past that point I am wondering if it makes sense to flesh out the rest of my slots in &quot;of the falcon&quot; gear (agil/int). Does that plan make sense - at least to get me out of the gate? Are there some quick and dirty &quot;goto&quot; peices or places/instances/factions I should hit beyond that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-23-2008, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">+healing will be the most important stat for you if you are talking about primary healing in a 5 man (gonna be REALLY tough to heal a heroic as feral, but normal shouldn't be a problem).  You have a decent mana pool from HoTW, but int will also help.  MP5 is your friend too, but dont gimp your +heal for it, as you can always sit and drink after every fight if needed.<br />
<br />
Look for &quot;of the physician&quot; gear on the AH, or pick up random +healing gear from quests that don't have feral rewards that you want.  Pretty easy to get up to ~1000+ healing in just random blue gear<br />
<br />
If you are looking to primarily dps, and pop out to heal in sticky situations, you will be fine with just your dps gear and picking up NI.  I don't think that building a set with +agi for the bonus to healing from NI will cut it for a primary healer.<br />
<br />
*edit:  as far as some quick &quot;goto&quot; pieces, I'd say pick up the cloth healing helm from Cenarion Expedition rep (revered iirc), see if you can find an Essence Focuser on the AH for ~20g, and pick up the Cenarion Expedition rep offhand if you are exalted with them.  there are some other rep +healing reward, but I don't have time to look through wowhead atm :)</div></div><hr />

I plan on fleshing out my healing kit a bit once i get a few tank upgrades.</div></div><hr />

If you enjoy saving the lives of your rogues with a well-placed regrowth every now and then it is very much worth your while to spend the 2 points on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-24-2008, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah this is interesting for me atm cos we've just started running 5 mans using 2 druids..me to tank and another to kitty dps with a priest as main healer.<br />
<br />
this is for running heroics and we're finding the priest is often running out of mana - despite having 9k.<br />
<br />
so the kitty druid is having to pop out and heal to help keep me up.<br />
<br />
need to ask him if he has NI.<br />
<br />
<br />
So tlbj - does that mean your kitty gear is really good or your normal healing gear is really bad ? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
i've put a bit of effort into a 'healing set'  but tbh in BC i dont really need it in the same way i did pre BC. not been asked/trusted to heal a 5 man yet ! lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">04-24-2008, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question is if you are feral with the usual feral talents but find yourself in a position where you might be the dedicated 5 man healer for an evening's run how can you best fill that role? The problem obviously (or at least in my mind) is that most of the feral leather gear has agility but no int. NI certainly helps for those shift out of cat form to pop a quick heal on X and then drop back down to cat form moments or if you are starting your raiding career generally in cat form. Even if you had something like 1k agility with your cat gear your mana pool will be crap - even if it is buffed by 20% from HoTW.<br />
 <br />
Can you get enough value out of agil/int or agil/spirit gear to justify NI for this specific purpose? Again this is outside of the raid cat to emergency healer and PvP roles the talent plays. If you can't and would get more value out of &quot;of the physician&quot; or even cloth healing gear which wont have any agility then those 2 points could probably be better spent elsewhere. Many many variables to this argument so the ultimate value comes down to how you play and what roles you tend to fill. This isn't to downplay the talent either - this was more of a mental exercise.</div></div><hr />

No.  But I still have 80+ agi in my healing kit.  That is 80 more +healing than I had before in my healing kit.<br />
<br />
Another real benefit of NI is the 20% healing boost while in cat form.  I do quite a bit of Kitty PvE and I always seem to take some sort of splash damage and/or the occasional hit (pulling a mob due to chain crits, etc.), by giving the healers an extra 20% when healing me, I sort of feel like I'm extending my own existence.  As I'm sure melee DPS are near the  bottom of the healing tree, especially in 5-mans.<br />
<br />
The +agi == +healing aspect of this talent is obviously for Feral PvP'rs.  The 20% healing boost in cat form, seems more like a PvE boost, though it does help in PvP if you have someone else healing (and it helps a bit with self-heals).  If I were leveling again, I'd pick up NI at lvl 66-67 (68-70 are thick hide) just for the self-healing boost.</div></div><hr />
