Thoughts pls !!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate reduction would have been a perfect focus effect for our Solteris tunic.  I'd prefer it on the Ashengate/Frostcrypt tunic as well, but I'd settle for it being on the Solteris one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Until such time as I can acquire a different item with a similar/better worn focus effect, I'm very unlikely to give up this epic, even though it recently turned 3 years old.  A couple more upgrades and my epic will officially become my worst piece of gear.<br />
<br />
Its become clear that I'm expected to keep it equipped until forever.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking forward to the clicky becoming broken once again with the level inceases to 80.  I assume we'll have to yell for a couple months to get it fixed, again.</div></div><hr />
