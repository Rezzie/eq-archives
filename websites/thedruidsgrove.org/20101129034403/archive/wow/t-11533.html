<br />
Posted by Ommra: We have upcoming development plans which we wanted to share now, as it could impact choices that Druids might make in the immediate future regarding flying mount riding skills or purchasing epic mounts:<br />
<br />
The regular Storm Crow form remains trainable at level 68 and moves at 60%. Also as previous, the normal flying mount skill comes with the form.<br />
<br />
An epic quest line will be going into an upcoming patch which will grant Druids an additional flying form with increased stats. The epic flying form will move at the epic rate of 280%, but basically fall under the same conditions as the previous flight form (i.e. can't run on the ground).<br />
<br />
However, the first prerequisite of the quest will require the epic flying mount riding skill, so it would not be a loss to Druids if they wish to purchase their epic flying mount skill now or in the near future. Obviously, one could then diversify their epic mounts beyond the Druid's casted epic form if they choose.</div></div><hr />

Step 1: Get a lock<br />
Step 2: Go to the Clefthoof herds in Nagrand (Note: the ones near durn as in the ones with 6 or 7 beasts per herd)<br />
Step 3: Spam Demo Roar till you have everyone aggroed<br />
Step 4: Let the Lock spam seed of corruption on every beast you get.<br />
Step 5: Loot them skin them and repeat.<br />
<br />
Not sure about other servers but Thick Clefthoof hides go for 10 gold a piece and all the knothide leather go for quite a bit as well. U will also get greens witch you can disenchant and occasionally pick up some dust or something you can hand in for almost 3 gold and 8000 xp and a halaa research token.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now I'm just grinding some rep with various factions and it's bringing in some decent gold (plus I don't mind grinding)<br />
<br />
I might consider doing quests/herb runs later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raising my enchanting was killing me, so I stopped for awhile. You get quite a few green quest rewards and drops, no one is buying the greens I put up on the AH but they do buy the arcane dusts and the Greater Planar Essences.<br />

I have my coinage, but wanted to see what was involved since this saves us about 200g by not purchasing a mount. I'm cheap and if the quest comes out soon, I'm probably not going to buy the mount. But, if this is to happen soemtime 2008...then I'm gona suck it up and buy the mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're already 900g ahead of everyone else for not having to buy the regular mount.<br />
<br />
I haven't even started the epic mount grind yet.  I've sent about 400g to my priest to buy her her epic (ground) mount.  <br />
<br />
I have been selling +12 stamina enchants to boots pretty easily for like 15g each, my mats.  Lots of people buy that.  Also, I've been farming Primal Air to sell +12agi to cloak enchants.  I didnt even start any of the quests in Shadowmoon, so I have a lot of gold to make there.  Ugh, gonna take a while tho.</div></div><hr />

1) riding crop -- faster speed for long distance travel... you can also put yourself on follow on people who have crops<br />
2) who knows when or how hard the quest will be.  The Blizz post said most likely in the next content patch.  That should be soonish I suspect because they put up a Black Temple coming soon page up.  <br />
<br />
200g isn't much these days and it'll still have use after we have our epic flight form.</div></div><hr />

I know this is old news but I'd like to update this for reference purposes. (I know when you typed this none of the information was released).<br />
<br />
1. It's been confirmed that there will be a trinket that will increase our Flight and Swift(Epic) Flight Form by 10% as a reward somewhere in the quest line.<br />
<br />
2. The quest line is on the PTR right now and someone on the official Druid boards has a walkthrough/guide of it and it doesn't look to hard...most of it is soloable =)<br />
<br />
I'm hard pressed to finish up all the quests now =/</div></div><hr />

Quote from WoWWiki: During the quests for the epic flight form on the second quest (The Ward of Wakening) a collection of herbs is required. Some of these are unique to the quest in Zangermarsh. The others include 10x Dreaming Glory, 10x Ancient Lichen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have already the 300 flightskill and what i have done is to grind scryer rep in shadowmoon near the blacktemple. You will get alot of scryer tokens and books. Futher you will loot an enormous amount of cloth which you can sell pretty good.<br />
<br />
At last i have created a bank char. Everytime i had 100 gold i  sended it to him. Cause when i have a decent amount of money i buy designs or ore for that.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you Moonbearer.  What a disappointment.  Here it is, the day of the U.S. patch and I'm just now finding this info. out.   This is very disheartening news to say the least. :curse:   I would have been working on getting money gathered up and just bought an epic gryffon if I knew this.  Why would I want to farm all that money and then have to do a difficult chain quest For This!!  *Sheesh*  May as well work toward getting a Netherdrake in my opinion.  And if people are upset about Druid Epic flight form, then roll a druid........ like was stated, there are benefits that every other class has, so it's quite crap that other classes complain.  :P<br />
