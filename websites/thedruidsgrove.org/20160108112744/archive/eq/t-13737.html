 <br />
Getting bored out of my mind with PoS frogs and HoH root rotting and have read a few stories on the board about Vxed. I don't own GoD at the moment (the only expansion I don't own) but was tempted to buy it for a change of solo scenery. Can anyone tell me if it is possible to just zone into Vxed or do I need to do the sewer trials 1st? (I'm 64 if that is relevant). If that is the case I won't bother as I just came back after 1 year and my guild is dead so I think it would be difficult to get a group together for the trials now.<br />

Just a couple little tricks to soloing this zone and it rocks. A whole instanced zone all to your self.<br />
 <br />
Ask the NPC for vxed then run in and check out the setup. If the first mob spawn point (2 mobs) does not have a stonemite then you are golden. If it does (they summon = death) then just quit the expedition and go get a new one (5 min timer).<br />
 <br />
I pull with ensnare and run to zone out. Immediately zone back in and the snared mob is sitting where you snared it - the other has gone back to spawn point. Then just DOT and keep rooting. Reallyhelps to have sylvan legs for mana free roots.<br />
 <br />
Just avoid the stonemites and you are golden. They respawn in about 20 mins.<br />
 <br />
Warning - do not let these mobs catch you.  If they stun you, you die.  They hit for 500+ so keep your distance....but DOTing reds that can be rooted and snared is really sweet exp.</div></div><hr />
