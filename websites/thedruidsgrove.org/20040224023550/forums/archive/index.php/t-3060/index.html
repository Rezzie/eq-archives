<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VereSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive never really looked much into stacking of items and effects, so forgive the lack of understanding on my part :)  <br />
<br />
I have 8th shawl and SCR 3.<br />
<br />
Someone told me that SCRM will not stack with shawl...any truth in that before I go and waste more aa's on it ?<br />
<br />
Also, I got a EE4 ring (Ring of Firewarding) the other day from SolC. Will this stack or is it just going to have to rot in my bank ?....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macnbaish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes I'm pretty certain they stack... SCRM takes you up to 50% extended duration the shawl is 20%.. that's how they get that magical 70% number...  Also keep in mind that the shawl only effects buffs longer than.. like 7 ticks or something (and therefore won't work on SoTW).  But SCRM will :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I tested it and they stack in perfect additive fashion, so you get 50% from SCRM plus whatever % from your item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Avendesoral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They do stack....a word on wood though.  Class associations were removed from AA abilities a few months back due to some kind of exploit on test.  No focus items will work on any AA abilities anymore for that reason, regardless of the minimum /ticks to affect.  Pretty poor way to handle the problem by screwing everyone on live servers imo, would be nice if they found a real solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For some reason, some AA abilities kept the class label.  Wrath of the Wild, for example, is still labelled as DRU/1.  Yay, extended enhancement on Wrath of the Wild...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Avendesoral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh my fault, I stand corrected, still sucks horribly though =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yrys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The exploit was because when you used /testbuff to make a level 25 on Test, it gave you all of the 1-25 spells for the class... even the ones that weren't really spells, like AA abilities.  We had some level 25 mages PLing themselves with AA pets...<br />
<br />
Pity they couldn't find a better way to fix it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I wonder why Wrath of the Wild didn't get adjusted then.  It seems to me a 650 point one-shot damage shield every 4 minutes could be just a bit overpowering at level 25, heh...</div></div><hr />
