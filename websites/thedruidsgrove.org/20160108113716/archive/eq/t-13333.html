<br />
We are having some problems beating uqua, we can usually get to the part with the twins but need to figure out what kind of healing technique to use. We have had CH rotations, but the clerics get ported over to the other sides and we end up killing 1 twin while the other side wipes, any and ALL help/suggestions will be GREATLY appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you :)</div></div><hr />

Be sure to make clerics get the clubs first so they can run fast.</div></div><hr />

CHeal rotation at twins is kinda iffy because of the teleport so it may be easier to switch to exclusively quick heals for them.</div></div><hr />

To avoid the AE's settle the healers behind the pillars if it isn't changed the AE is Line of sight.<br />
 <br />
Most important is to kill both twins nearly at the same time, because when the firstone die it took perhaps 2 ticks untill the second get the abilities from the dead twin make it nearly impossible to kill afterwards.<br />

I hope i did not spoiled this fight to much ;)</div></div><hr />

Infusion if you have it is nice for this fight so you dont get ported, good luck. Have fun with Barxt, I actually like this raid, it was a nice challenge and chage of pace after doing time 40000000 times.<br />

CHO for each twin was in the same group.  Stand the healers behind the pillars and you should be fine.  If a healer gets ported, just run to the same area with the other healers and heal their tank.  Have a backup tank or two  We normally did Uqua with 5-7 Warriors, but thinks have changed, just be ready to have a switch up.</div></div><hr />
