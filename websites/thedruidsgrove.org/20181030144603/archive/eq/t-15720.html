I did this quest inside of 10 minutes.  Its very simple.  This quest is supposed to be completely soloable - I just find this way a lot easier.  I want you to read the write up to get a basic idea on how to get the quest.  This all takes place at zone in - there will be no adds.  <br />
<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3939<br />
<br />
<br />
You can only have 1 quested person at a time get a shield.  Oddly - if more then 1 person has this quest in your group and someone fails - you all fail.  No matter - you can just get it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have the quest - Wraithguard Hunter Grethmar (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=24161) will spawn right outside of Frostcrypt.  When you hail him he will poof.   You then zone into Frostcrypt.    <br />
<br />
Set up 2 hotkeys in /say ... STOP and MOVE - Only the quested person who hailed Grethmar - can control Grethmar.<br />
<br />
When you zone in you will see a few guards and him at the zone in.   Target Grethmar.  Spam STOP until Warlord Vongar, the Relentless (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=24160)  spawns.  This can take a few minutes...  Take 1 or 2 people with you to assist Grethmar until Warlord Vongar, the Relentless (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=24160) is dead. The person doing the quest always keeps Grethmar targeted, let your friends beat the warlord down.   He is not hard and never summoned the 3 times I did the quest.  I like to use casters - They can just cast away from a distance.  Melee classes will steal argo from Warlord - so avoid using them unless you have a cleric with you - I am not sure if Warlord is slowable - never had a slow class with me. Someone might want to confirm this...<br />

Congratz on shield.... DONE....<br />
<br />
The shield has the graphic of the shields the guards have in vald.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the kicker though...<br />
<br />
You must have at least indifferent faction with Wraithguard Leadership in order to request this task.<br />
<br />
That faction is a beeyotch :(<br />
<br />
Worth working, just hard work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfyre</div><div class="date">03-28-2007, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naw... very very easy to get.. just do Runic Ivory quest like 10 times (kill mammouths for tusks).. can be indifferent very very quickly.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This is a must for most groupers and even some raiders who are not maxxed on those mod2's this shield offers.<br />
 <br />
Cibby<br />
 <br />
p.s. my sk has bracer x2 done will do tusks and get incursion tonight to make sure he is correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaene</div><div class="date">03-29-2007, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, Leadership has been made easier.  As I recall you used to only be able to do Runic Ivory once?<br />
<br />
In any event, wanted to post that I got the shield and used a shammy rather than a necro.  Threw shammy pet at mob, and had shammy right on zoneline.  Pet died, shammy zoned, quest updated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the lead, Wind :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">03-29-2007, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We never used the pet deal at all......we did this 7 times last nite.<br />
 <br />
when the Warlord dies you can still spam guy with stop and about 1-2 mins later he will de-pop and you get ur credit.....if you snare the mob doesn't path into the other reg mobs area.<br />
 <br />
Runic ivory can be repeated IF you had a character flag for CoS, Runed Diamond, Armor Supplies and Runic Ivory (which Windfyre and I did for our staff quest).<br />
 <br />
Lets hope they don't renerf this today....my lil sk wants this :)<br />
 <br />
p.s. getting braaiinnss Monster mission Ac aug is great for this shield now!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">03-29-2007, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this for my necro, with help from my beastlord.   Slowed the Warlord and easily killed him.  Be aware he will run (walk) at low life.  Killed him quick enough that those shade buddies of his never made an appearance (first time I tried it solo with necro and a couple blue shades spawned to assist Warlord).  I did not kill anything at all in addition to the Warlord, be it other mobs or even a pet.   Once Warlord died, Grethmar stood there for a couple, and then pathed off to zoneline where he poofed, which updated and completed the task.<br />
<br />
Considering the third/final stage of the task has multiple objectives all rolled into one, I can see how it might bug out or fail sometimes:<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep Grethmar and his guards alive and destroy whatever is menacing the incursion forces of the Wraithguard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Too much 'and' in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pinepath</div><div class="date">03-30-2007, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get Wraithguard Leadership, not just wraithguard faction for doing the simple things like ivory collection now?  <br />
<br />
They did make it easy then, I thought you still had to do Shade's Bane for Leadership faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">03-30-2007, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it doesn't show WL faction BUT it allows you to talk to the guy who gives out this task.....and he bumps you from appreh to amiable with just this one task.<br />
 <br />
We tested this with just 2 bracers .....couldn't get it.....1 bracer 1 tusk done couldn't get it.....as soon as we had 2 bracers 1 tusk everyone could get....NOW my friends chars did not do the tusks.....but he hunted in FC and had little different level of dubious.....so its some level of dubious that bumps you over with the next NPC (Commander Hearsgan).<br />
 <br />
We have done 9/10 of our crew so we are super happy and braainnss and EJ MM will be next to aug them.</div></div><hr />

I had already done the bracer task twice so all i had to do was knock out the runic ivory task once and i was able to get the shield.<br />

Yes im sure its going to get nerfed very very soon.    Perhaps when fabled is taken out on the 16th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benwin</div><div class="date">04-03-2007, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, thank you very much for posting this Windfyre.  I got my shield last night...<br />
<br />
Just a few additional things....<br />
<br />
I believe on my Druid I had only completed the bracer quest, it took the completion of 2 runic ivory quests for me to attain the faction required to get the shield quest.  Doh which I can remember what it was, I believe I got it with less than indifferent faction...<br />
<br />
I followed the guide exactly, and the whole process worked very smoothly, a few notes to add:-<br />
<br />
a)  Try and stand away from Grethmar, as the mob you need to kill (warlord) spawns right next to him and will hit you first, if you are right there.<br />
<br />
b) The Warlord is tougher than Grethmar from what I could tell.  Therefore besides slowing him, I put all the dots I could on him and chain nuked him with enchanter and druid.<br />
<br />
c) After the fight, I said move and Grethmar moved, then stopped and moved a few steps back to zone-in, and quest update was received then.</div></div><hr />

And for the additional posts by others about faction.  I can confirm that this worked today and I got two of them.  Unfortunately, my druid is a bit small for this yet, but my ranger and mage thank you.  ; )<br />
  Can anyone confirm doing this with a very low level toon like level 55?  I wouldn't mind doing this before it's nerfed, even though I'm leveling the druid very slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I decided to work on my faction for this last night, went to Icefell and wandered over to the bear area, some necros were decimating them and allowed me to scavange the loot.  Got 4 pelts very quickly and went to turn them in.<br />
 <br />
Now this got me my 2nd Bracer and have previously done Runic Ivory once....  but unfortunatly Commander Hearsgan still would not talk to me.<br />
 <br />
Guess I have to farm ivory again now!<br />
Any other suggestions to help with this faction for a level 70 Druid????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaene</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you haven't done it, you should do the Runed Diamond quest - pages/scrolls/bundles from Gnolls in the Steppes, 50/50/50 aug with Mana Pres VI with a Leadership faction hit.<br />
<br />
If you're brave, you can try the quest Construction of Shadows - no killing required, just exploring Frostcrypt.  It's hard, and I wouldn't like to try without Second Life... but ymmv :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pootle</div><div class="date">04-20-2007, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I headed back to Icefall last night in order to farm mammoths for the ivory quest, got chatting to a necro who was kiting them and he invited me to duo with him.  He was after faction for the shield too. <br />
 <br />
We both got our 4 ivorys and headed to Valeholm (sp?).  After the turnin I headed over to shield quest guy and he was now happy to talk to me.  Got the quest and headed into Frostcrypt.  The necro joined me as he didnt know the quest and wanted to see how it was done.<br />
 <br />
I ran through it and the nec was supprised how easy it was.  I then stuck around to help him with his.<br />
 <br />
So for Faction -<br />
2x Runic Ivory<br />
2x Bearpelt quest (the bracer one)<br />
 <br />
Shield Quest -<br />
I (70 Druid) and a Nec (73) with &quot;D'Blue to me&quot; pet, killed the named and Hunter Grethmar was about 35% Health when named died.<br />
I was DoTing with my 3 DoTs and nuking.  Not sure what spells the necro was casting.<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps anyone wanting to do this quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sippin</div><div class="date">06-05-2007, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This IS an excellent shield. Unfortunately for me, I only had one toon who hadn't already trashed their faction XPing in VH in the first few days of the expansion.<br />
<br />
How hard is it to fix that faction by xping in Frostcrypt? My problem with that zone is the fact that giants can't be mezzed. My group really doesn't do well with &quot;untamed&quot; adds in camp. I assume the shades, being undead giants, are unmezzable? Are there any spots in that area where you can reliably pull one mob at a time? When I explored the zone in shroud rogue form (in the early days before they nerfed this) it seemed to me that the mobs were spawned as thick as fleas on a rat, with nary a spot that would be safe even to go afk for a few minutes.<br />

<br />
I brought my BST along, and with slow (partial 65%), -190ATK, couple druid dots, few nukes, bst pet, 3 bst nukes... I had Warlord Vongar dead while Grethmar still had about 50% life left.  Oddly enough, Vongar didn't agro on my pet...he stayed on Grethmar the whole time.<br />
<br />
Resists on Vongar are about non-existant.  Ensnare AA landed first time, all debuffs, even fire nukes landed instantly.<br />
<br />
To confirm:  Don't need to leave the entrance room.  Just spam stop for a while after Warlord dead...took probably 5 minutes before the quest ran itself out.</div></div><hr />
