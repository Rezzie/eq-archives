I have come across many more compitent druids as well. I am wondering how everone else fairs against other druids in the x-bg's?<br />
On a side note I've come across MANY MANY noobs. I beat a warrior once with 500hp and no mana(when he attacked) I was casterform melee for part of the battle until I got enough mana to go to bear it was hilarious.</div></div><hr />

...On a more serious tone, I have come across full tier2 druids that have no skill whatsoever, whether they be healing or not and I've come across a couple druids in 5man instance gear that are feral and know how to PvP too well for my liking...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 Now I have never been the greatest at pvp but on my druid I never had much trouble with hunters. Now on my hunter I never seem to have much trouble with druids. 1v1 I have yet to lose to a druid even when they got the jump on me and honestly it suprises me alot. It seems that none of them know that when my hands start to glow black that a fear is coming. I have never had a druid shift out to screw up the fear cast. The get feared, then trapped and they end up dead.<br />
<br />
 So many new druids dont use all their skills.</div></div><hr />

The main thing I've learned is any community that was built during server only BGs is gone for good.  There is no more getting to love &amp; hate your servers opposing faction.  The only reason I have a horde druid at all is b/c of the really cool people I got to know during my pvp grind.  It really saddens me that such a large part of the community feel of the game is gone.  <br />
<br />
As per how others play:  I always giggle when a druid gets caught in hibernate ( even when I get caught by it &gt;.&lt; ), or when they don't know enough to shift out of roots / frost nova / etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A mixed server PUG that enters a game with a premade team all from one server is #1 - intimidated, and #2 - Outclassed, unless they are just lucky.  <br />
<br />
My server srtill has the community.  At first I was afraid it would be gone.  I was afraid that premade teams were no longer an option...but thats far from true.<br />
<br />
I am having more fun than ever because in between my team games, I am constantly in AV due to no queue times.</div></div><hr />

I miss getting to know the horde on my server ( I'm alliance ).  I rolled a horde druid just to chat with the people I pvp'd against b/c they ended up being really cool people.  <br />
<br />
With the pool of people so much bigger and the probability of actually matching up against anyone from my server anymore nearly gone, THAT'S what I mean about losing the community.</div></div><hr />

Since priests can mind vision you and see where you are, there's no real need to go and hide (unless you're a punk and you're terrain hacking up on some ledge [then again, I can't blame you, what bliz doesn't fix gets exploited.  no news...])...<br />
<br />
Since there's no need to run and hide, I find the best spot to hang out while you wait for the horde flag to return is outside on the second level above the tunnel exit on the horde side...  There is a hump there right next to the fence.  Remember this is on the OTHER side of the fence.  So the side facing the mid field.  Just take a look there and you'll see the hum.  You can easily run along the outer side of the fence to get there.  The cool thing?  If you're in cheetah, you can easily clear the fence just by jumping...  But everyone else can't make that jump...  They have to mount up in order to follow you.  So if you hang out there, you can have a view of the mid field and see when people are coming to get you.  If you get caught by a rouge, shift out of cheetah, warstomp, shift back into cheetah and jump the fence.  They'll have to go all the way around to catch you.  If it's 40+, the'll have to mount up.  Either way, you're out of there long before they can do anything...<br />
<br />
This doesn't apply if a mage/hunter/warlock/priest comes gunning for you, of course...  But most of the time, I find it's a rogue/warrior/pally who comes to reclaim the flag.  They'll never catch you in the 30-39 bracket.  And even in the 60 bracket, this makes it very hard to be caught...<br />
<br />
Sure beats sitting on the roof with my butt half into the wall and not able to see anything...</div></div><hr />

i think that will come back in full force when Burning Crusade comes out. i really do. there are going to be a ton of pvp objectives fromw what i have read in every zone. Some quests etc will not even be available unless you faction controls whatever pvp objective is in that zone. This sort of world pvp will have nothing to do with x-realms. Honestly, i feel that blizzard is trying to move more to this. I think x-realm will be there, but it will be more for people who want a game within a game. the rivalry will exist and become even more heated in the expansion when we are fighting for strategic locations etc.<br />
<br />
at least i hope :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see that helping SOME, but before X-realms, people that did that honor grind all knew each other, on both factions.  I created alts just to go chat with the people I faced all the time.  I'm now lvling a horde druid just to be able to group with them ( pvp and raiding ).<br />
<br />
We faced many of the same people over and over and over again.  Sure, sometimes it sucked seeing the same people over and over again, but you got to know them, see when they got new gear, watched them get better, etc.<br />
<br />
With X-Realms I think I've seen hordies from my server in about 1 out of ever 20 games.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
In the World Encounters ( as described above ) I'd like to hope people would get regular groups to handle these areas, but I don't know if that will happen.  I foresee groups going in to control it just to pickup/turn-in the quests and be done with it.<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />
