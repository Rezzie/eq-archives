The combined must have worked because the compelled spirit emoted what he was suppose to.<br />
 <br />
However, when I said what I was suppose to say &quot;who are you&quot;  he never said anything.  I even went through all of the dialogue but I never heard from him again.  I was at the exact loc and even moved around a bit and tried the /say in spots all around the fallen pillar.<br />
 <br />
This is the first part I have had any trouble with.  Now looks like I have to go back and do the nro event again.  Which was no problem but time consuming.  <br />
 <br />
Has anyone ever had any problem with this part?  If so please let me know any info you may have.<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />

I had the same thing happen to me and it was because I was still invisible.  Had to do the steps leading up to that part over again.  :(</div></div><hr />
