Is the only other way to leanr Goblin speech is to use training points?<br />
I was curious, as the game progressed through the years, how did folks learn Dragon speech and other languages? I understand that you can learn from grouping with folks, but how did it all begin?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">05-01-2009, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">usually just one training point, then, some weirdoes spamming each other alot with gibberish in a random zone with a convenient zone in/out point for quicker learning capacity. Eventually, we skilled up enough from the repeated zoning and stuff to where we understood our gibberish was actually gibberish.<br />
Aside from that, there are few mobs in the game that will speak goblin. You could get lucky repeatedly hailing random non kos goblins in goblin to see if they respond, who knows they might even talk back or give a quest, which would be probably undiscovered. <br />
<br />
Dragon went the same way, although there were some dragons that talked back.  But, if you really want to learn what goblins say, perhaps warcraft will help out with the merchants and zeppelins that scream AHHH! Are you threatening me! and whatever else.</div></div><hr />

You can teach to 1 point higher than the character spamming, so even if you box (which I've used to language up) you can just bounce +1 skill back and forth between two characters until both get 100.  Zoning isn't required.</div></div><hr />
