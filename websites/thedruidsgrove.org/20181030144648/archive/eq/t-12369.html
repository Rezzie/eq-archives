Greetings!<br />
 <br />
I have all the expansions through Gates of Discord. I am a solo player - level 61 Druid - with very limited play time. I do not belong to a guild.<br />
<br />
For the most part, the last couple of expansions really did not enhance my play style. ~However~ I keep reading about the ability to do solo quests with, I think both Omens of War and Dragons of Norrath. And I think I recall reading (can't remember now where ~old age setting in~ &lt;!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :doh --&gt;http://www.eqdruids.com/emoticon/WendyDoh.gif)&lt;!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--&gt; that one of those two was better than the other for the solo player.<br />
<br />
So, for those of you who have kept up with the new expansions, if I only choose one of the new expansions post Gates of Discord, which would you recommend? Again, my MAIN interest is being able to play solo and either get some decent exp and/or something in the way of decent loot.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much in advance for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />

Nobles causeway is a very good zone for the solo druid, there are two zone wide random drops there that are excellent, plus a quest cloak can be done very easily solo (once you kill enough dragorn to get faction).  Tier one armor is also a possibility, altho not solo at your level.  <br />
<br />
The aug drops are mostly very rare random drops, but are a nice plus.  There are a couple augs in dranic scar that you could solo, one is 5 to all stats, other is saves.<br />
<br />
OOW definitely offers more for the solo druid, especially one not at 70 yet.<br />

<br />
However... DoN provides with some purchaseable potential armor upgrades, then again you need to group for those.</div></div><hr />

As I reflect on it, OoW would be the next logical expansion for me after Gates of Discord, but just didn't want to shell out more $ for more zones, content, guild stuff, etc. that personally I wouldn't use.<br />
 <br />
Again, I appreciate your input!!</div></div><hr />

Have picked up the sash and shield and completed broken sword quest, sorry no links. I bind here and pop in. I can solo if no one is there and can pick up good groups. I have a lv 63 and have been camping here since high 50's. Good place to crank out some AA experience. The rest of the zone would be difficult. Be warned these mobs can hit in the 450 range and some can summon.</div></div><hr />
