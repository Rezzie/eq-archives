I havn't been in the mats supply market for some time... usually observing your AH for a week wil give you a good idea of prices tho'<br />
<br />
If your alliance, there's a quest which requires 5 silver bars to complete... so you might try sell'n stacks of 5 a bit above the normal rate.  Impatient questers/solo'ers are usually good sources of coin.</div></div><hr />

It's harder to find resource nodes than with skinning, but every time you mine something there's that chance of getting gems or other sweet treasure.  Plus, later on, things like Rich Thorium Veins are big and shiny, they almost look like they'd be good to eat.. and the possibility of getting an arcane crystal provides much of the excitement.<br />
<br />
With skinning the best you can hope for is some hide, or getting 2 leather instead of 1.<br />

Most of the metals sell well as long as your server isn't overloaded with miners.  There are always people who pick up blacksmithing/engineering after they hit 60 and need the resources for their goods.  <br />
<br />
I've found that iron is the easiest and most profitable on my server.  A stack of 20 sells for 4g+ (usually 4g 75s).  <br />
<br />
Either way....keep mining.  Keep smelting.  You'll level your mining as you level your toon.  Once you get to iron, the money will roll in.  Just don't go on a spending binge at the AH for gear.  <br />
<br />
Btw, Arathi Basin is great for iron.  There is some silver, tin and mithril deposits sprinkled in there, but mostly iron.  The caves to the southeast with the ogres and trolls are great.  Just run a big circle around the map.</div></div><hr />
