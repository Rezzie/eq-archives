<br />
If they work in all zones, the description is worded very poorly.<br />
<br />
If they only work in LDoN zones, that stinks.<br />

PS - Looked over all my equipment.  All of it had &quot;Slot 1, type 1&quot; added to it, with the following two exceptions:<br />
<br />
Epic had &quot;Slot 1, Type 4&quot;<br />
Bridle had no slots.</div></div><hr />

There are some charms for sale that only work in LDoN dungeons, but I haven't heard of any augments that only work in them.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen any regular items having more than one slot.. maybe I'm not uber enough. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the clarification!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only LDoN items have more then one slot. Only time/elemental type items have better then Slot 1, for pre-LDoN items, as far as I can find. Slot is the quality, type is what can fit in it. Like Slot 1, type 4. Type 4 are weapon only augmentations, so that's all the item can take, no +stats/resists, just things like procs, and +damage, and maybe other stuff.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much everything else I own has one type 1 slot (or one type 4 slot for weapons).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No clue, that was kind of weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MellenFC</div><div class="date">09-09-2003, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">those first bought ones are augmentations for your charm.. I think the way it works out is final stats for your charm is  Charm stats + augmentation stats.<br />
<br />
Charm stats are varied depending on the conditions of the charm (ie: it raining in the current zone, have an illusion up etc.)  Augmenation stats would be the same, the ones you buy their condition is that you be in a ldon zone so pretty sure those particular charm augmentations do only work in ldon zones.  <br />
<br />
They seem to be junk ones though anyways.  I think you're meant to use the adventurer's stone charm augmenation with the pop charm to get a good effect.  The condition on that one is that it gets stronger as you learn more from the wayfarers.  The learning them seems to be like a ldon flag.  Got a msg along those lines for every 2 completed adventures when you hail the appropriate person back in the wayfarer's camp.  Think 2 completed adventures in all 5 dungeons = a set of stat increases on that augmentation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Type 1&lt;/strong&gt; - these are going to be your stat upgrades to items such as +hp, +mana, gains in saves, wis/int/sta etc.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Type 2&lt;/strong&gt; - these will be upgrades such as Flowing Thought, Regeneration, Atk upgrades<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Type 3&lt;/strong&gt; - this is just a guess, but I would imagine something such as focus effects like mana pres, improved healing, etc<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Type 4&lt;/strong&gt; - found on weapons, these will add procs<br />
<br />
If I am a lil wrong feel free to upgrade, this is just second hand info from my brother who beta tested it.</div></div><hr />
