I played EQ from Oct. 1999 thru Nov 2006. I played WoW ever since. I was just missing EQ so much. I find WoW so watered down, the game is handed to you. No Challenge. I see people getting to lvl 70 who have no clue about the game.<br />
I want to come home!!<br />
But for EQ I dont have a huge amount of time to play, I just miss the old days. I was thinking of using my lvl 62 Druid to power level a new character and do the Orc Camps of EC, Dervs in WC, Crocs in Oasis, Hill Giants in RM.<br />
Does the under lvl 50 content still exist? Did EQ add anymore content to the under lvl 50 folks?<br />
Also....I had  a few accounts that friends gave to me and I had the billing in my name. I forgot those user names and passwords. But the subscriptions were in my name for at least a year or more.I know Sony doesnt like that I know, but geez I figure they would be happy to get a returning customer.<br />
Is there anyway for me to retrieve the usernames and passwords from accounts that I had the billing in my name, but original registration was in another name who i dont even recall?</div></div><hr />

All of the existing content for those levels is still there, though--and given the rate that you can fly through the first 50 levels, particularly if you make use of the hotzones, it's probably just as well that new content has focused on the upper levels.<br />
<br />
Current hotzones, from http://everquest.allakhazam.com/hotzones.html<br />
North Ro and South Ro<br />
Solusek's Eye<br />
Blightfire Moors<br />

Dulak's Harbor<br />

Akheva Ruins<br />
Crypt of Nadox<br />
Riwwi, Coliseum of Games<br />
Torden, Bastion of Thunder<br />
Ruins of Illsalin<br />

In each of the hotzones (as well as zones that were previously hotzones) new loot has been added.</div></div><hr />

There is a 'skinspike' type of potion that gives better DS than druids spells at the same level, and can stack with druid DS.  So with your druid buffing your char and the potion you will kill mobs in no time.</div></div><hr />

I still have a Manastone and Hog Beads so I may make a Necro or SK.<br />
Is allakazam decent for EQ? It was priceless for WoW.</div></div><hr />

I can't answer your question there, though; I don't really play EQ anymore.  It used to be a pretty good information source, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For spell information, while http://lucy.allakhazam.com is still useful, it has been surpassed by Kumbaja's spell parser:<br />
http://www.antonius-bayle.org/kumbaja/spells/spell_view.php<br />
<br />
For items, http://lucy.allakhazam.com will do (in addition to the main Allakhazam site).  I like http://eqitems.13th-floor.org/ for its &quot;Guru Search&quot; ability, though, which lets me perform advanced searches that are simply not possible at any other site I've seen.<br />
<br />
For tradeskills, http://www.eqtraders.com is still THE place to go.</div></div><hr />

I am glad sites still exist, I was worried EQ was gone in regards to sites etc.<br />
There was a rumor on WoW boards that EQ3 is coming out. I wonder how that will make things turn out.<br />
I still believe EQ1 will always reign superior of all the games. <br />
To me, WoW is like watching a cartoon, and we just manipulate the keyboard a bit to make it go, sort of like that game Dragons Lair from way back when LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damas</div><div class="date">07-01-2008, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one thing Id advise if using your dru to plvl another char is to just make sure you put the time into getting those skills up. IF you pick a class that can cast, you can lvl them much faster than their skills and could run into fizzling ALOT if you dont put some time into their casting skills. Btw wb I think you will find that eq has provided alot more items of pretty decent quality for those who cant put the time into raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">11-11-2008, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I've heard about any EQ3 idea.  If they do, I'd *love* it to be a remake of EQ1, with all the philosophy and grand design of EQ1, rather than the incredibly bland stuff of WoW (and its carbon copy, EQ2).<br />
<br />
I totally agree with your sentiments over WoW.  It's just so repetitive - you get all your basic spells by level 20 or so and from there until the end game you basically just get version 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc upgrades of the same old spells.<br />
<br />
Mobs - same old bandits, same old murlocs, same old gnolls etc just higher levels.  Sure, you could say &quot;same old Orcs / Gnolls&quot; for EQ but no - there are huge varieties of mobs, and even the Orcs and Gnolls have different tribes and visual styles to make them at least seem different from the ones you fought at level 5.<br />
<br />
Then you have the quests/advancement.  Go to new zone, pick up all the BORING quests to kill 10 of x, 5 of y and loot 4 of z (occasionally pick up 5 of something off the floor), do them all, move on to the next zone that you're &quot;guided&quot; to, rinse, repeat.  EQ is more of an effort, and it's natural human instinct to walk the path of the least effort, but if you work around this instinct and return to EQ you find that you get a MUCH better feeling of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
Sorry.  You gave me an excuse to rant about dumbed-down games like WoW and I got carried away.  It just makes me really sad that EQ is almost empty now, given all the amazing thought, love and attention to detail it was given in comparison with the competition, and I just hope that if this EQ3 concept is real that it's developed with the same philosophy.  There's Vanguard, but that seems even more empty (it doesn't have the brand recognition of EverQuest I suppose).  Not to mention you need a Cray supercomputer with a graphics card from the year 2025 to run it at more than 5 fps ;)<br />
<br />
Rant over.<br />
There must be somewhere you can tap in your old email address and have it re-send the username?  Failing that phone SOE?<br />
<br />
If all else fails, it should be easy enough to burn through the first 60 levels.  Even I am almost up to 60, and I'm the slowest leveller on Norrath.  Serpent Spine exp is really quite amazing.</div></div><hr />

Funny you should mention that; it has been a common complaint of the last several EQ expansions.  There have been a few new ideas thrown in--which is much better than not getting anything new--but the bulk of the spells for most classes are slightly boosted versions of older spells.  (That said, just how many different ways can you make a spell that has the fundamental effect &quot;do X damage to a target&quot;?)<br />
<br />
When you reach those upper levels, you'll find relief in AAs, though.  AAs give you some neat hotkey-able abilities, which easily make up for the lack of variety in spells.  Besides, spell gem space is very limited; I'd much rather be getting new abilities in AA form than in spell form.</div></div><hr />

There is a new video game sony is starting to work on, it is going to be a console online multiplayer. It will be based on Everquest. It will be nothing like Everquest online adventures, or the Champions of Norrath series, or the stategy, Lords of Everquest, save for some names and stuff from Everquest. I do not have all the details yet, but, they are working on it at the moment, try back in March, April 2009 timeframe for more of idea what they are working on.<br />
<br />
 But, you will have basic fighting/spell casting twitch based in a 3d environment typical console video game styles similar to prince of persia, god of war, The Two Towers and Return of the King fighting styles. Whether that translates to a persistant online world, again I have no clue at the moment, so that would be speculating, or whether there will be &quot;mission oriented&quot; gameplay with more limited levels and such.</div></div><hr />
