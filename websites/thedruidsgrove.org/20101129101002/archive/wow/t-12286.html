<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">12-30-2007, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not any more. For damage spells there is really no reason to, and for healing spells the new calculation of +healing benefits that came with BC really made it useless to do so.<br />
<br />
Also most healing Druids go for Tree, where you only use HoTs, and the one HoT we use mostly only has one level.<br />
<br />
So, no. I'd guess most of us do not use downranking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure how he does it in raid though but in a 5 man he has to use really low ranking heals. Never had a problem with him gaining agro until he started getting all the good gear from raiding  with the +healing on it; once he went to even lower ranked heals then we didnt have a problem anymore.</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine it'd get more difficult if I actually raided and got to 1800-2000, though.<br />
<br />
For PvP, though, I have downranked spells on my bars. Rank 1 HoTs and DoTs/Debuffs for dispel fodder.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, your best healing spell is already downranked! Lifebloom is only rank 1. &gt;&gt;;</div></div><hr />

thanks again</div></div><hr />

<br />
If its heroics then the tank isnt good enough, if its normal dungeons, who cares, he could probably tank an add or 2 as resto anyway lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A second note (not so much directed at OP) that downranking generally isn't used as a strategy to reduce healing aggro.  Other healing classes downrank their spells for mana efficiency reasons.  If your tank (normal or heroic) can't keep up with the TPS of a couple of HoT ticks, fire him.  I could understand the tank asking you to hold back a little bit if and only if there are three or more mobs to tank.</div></div><hr />
