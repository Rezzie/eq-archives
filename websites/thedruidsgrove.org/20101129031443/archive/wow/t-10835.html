<br />
From the press release: &quot;In Silithus, the situation has grown even worse. Geysers of a strange red crystalline dust have been appearing in the desert. Whatever this dust is, it seems to be related to the crystals nestled in the sands. As it happens, this dust, or spice, has valuable properties. Players can collect spice from these very visible geysers, which spawn throughout the desert, and return the resource to their faction's base in the area. These bases are the same locations where each faction receives field duty quests for the Cenarion Circle. On normal (player-vs.-environment) realms, players will become PvP-flagged as soon as they collect spice from a node. You cannot carry more than one load of spice at a time.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Players receive an individual buff upon turning in spice, but beware: should you be defeated before completing the turn-in, enemy players can take the spice from you. When one of the factions collects a certain amount of spice, that faction gains a powerful buff that benefits all faction members in the zone or in either of the Ahn'Qiraj instanced dungeons. At that point, the spice counts are reset, and the competition begins again between the factions to gain the zone-wide buff.<br />
 <br />
&quot;The world PvP battles in The Eastern Plaguelands are based on a capture-and-hold style of gameplay, centring on the four towers in the region. Players who are flagged for PvP can attempt to capture a tower by controlling the area around it, keeping it free of enemy players. The more allies you have with you near each tower, the faster your faction (Alliance or Horde) will capture it. The faction that controls each tower earns a benefit, such as a fast flight path across the zone. Any faction that manages to control all four towers simultaneously earns a zone-wide buff that increases attack power or spell power against Undead for all faction members in the region or in Stratholme.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm.... A world PvP goal that consists of surviving while running from one place to another as quick as possible?  Sounds like Druid Loving to me!<br />
