 <br />
When I get a &quot;Gift of Mana&quot; it lasts such a short time that by the time I can cast something to take advantage of it the 'Gift of Mana Fades'.  <br />
I have equipped an item that gives me spell haste (ceramic totem of something range item... cannot remember the name) but I still have the problem.  It usually goes like this while I am soloing in VXED:<br />
 <br />
I nuke the mob and root breaks as I get the Gift of Mana.  If I re-root I usually run out of time to get the gift.  If I try to cast a DoT or Nuke to take advantage of the gift the reset time after the first cast, plus the cast time of the next spell can get done in time, but by then the snared mob is on top of me.  <br />
 <br />
Any advice on how you folks have luck with GoM?<br />

THanks!<br />

<br />
Since Sony has made it clear that they encourage grouping more than soloing, this isn't unexpected.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that it lasts about 18 seconds.  I would like it to last longer but it does help at times.  I admit I really want it to last longer but I'm not sure if I would push for it.  And, of course, it always goes off when I don't need it and not when I do (k, not always, but it sometimes seems that way:).<br />
<br />
I have set up a audio trigger to say &quot;Gift of Mana&quot; whenever it goes off so I know that I have to use it right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saying that GoM is geared only towards grouping and raiding isn't really accurate. The tools there, you just have to think how to utilize it properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually if my understanding of DoTs is accurate, the system does a &quot;chance break root&quot; roll every tick on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just DoT the mob up first, if you get a GoM &quot;proc&quot; while DoT'ing, great, next DoT free, if the last DoT triggers it, great, first nuke free.  For Vxed though I would suggest perhaps just root/rotting.  The mobs there are controllable enough via snare that you can get 2 to 3 mobs going at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinner</div><div class="date">03-06-2006, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to nuke alot because I have maxed out all my Critical Nuke AA paths and thus get great return on the mana I spend.  However if I can resist the nukes except as a response to a GoM hit I may well come out ahead in the mana department.. it will just take a lot longer to kill each mob.  I am usually trying to kill as many mobs as I can before my Double EXP AA wears off.  <br />
Thanks for your perspectives on this all!  Much appreciated.<br />
