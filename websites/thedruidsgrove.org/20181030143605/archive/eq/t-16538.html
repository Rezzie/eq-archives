This is the view I prefer; I didn't bother overcomplicating with item names and streamlined the tier ranking.<br />
 <br />
I currently don't have anywhere to host anything but an image file. If anyone would like the Excel table PM me. I will update this as we find out more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">01-23-2008, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think DoT focii are being phazed out, they now have stuff like Merciless incineration, which increases damage of all fire based spells, and arcane detonation, which increases damage of all magic based spells. <br />
 <br />
Focus effects like these affect DoTs and DD, and they have one for each damage base, so based on a guess (and this is purely a guess) i don't recall having seen any Purely DoT based Focus. <br />
 <br />
So its possible that it was removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annabella</div><div class="date">01-23-2008, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank goodness for that too.<br />
 <br />
Raid gear moved away from that after GoD (lookup Discordant focus effects - there was Discordant Flame (DD) and Discordant Fire (DoT), even heals had 'direct' and 'over time' variants, it was sad).<br />
 <br />
I think there were still some purchasable/droppable DoN augs that were &quot;burning affliction&quot; style for DoTs but haven't noticed it on (our) raid gear since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">01-23-2008, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't personally seen burning affliction on anything since DoN.  As far as other DoT focii go, the ones that are extremely useful would be affliction efficiency and affliction haste, both of which offer DoTs a vastly better effect than anything you can find on raid gear.  Unfortunately, in many cases this has historically meant that raiders would have to sacrifice an aug slot or actually wear lesser gear to get the effect.<br />
 <br />
Both were introduced into tribute as twinge of suffering and vision of suffering up to level 6.  Level 5 (to level 70) was the last that was made available to gear.  Level 7 has not been updated on tribute (nor has anything else; I posted on the SOE boards last weeks and haven't heard a peep from the devs on an ETA).<br />
 <br />
The long and short is, if you're a dotter, level 6 trib is your best option for DoT focus right now.</div></div><hr />

Oh, any chance the colors can be toned down some in the table in the first post?  The table has useful information but it's painful to look at. :)</div></div><hr />

You'll notice about the 5th post down I've actually posted the link to the original excel file.  You can play with it however you like.  Personally the colors are half the reason I made my own table.</div></div><hr />
