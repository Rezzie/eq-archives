 <br />
I have 41k HP with the actual debuff on me.  The debuff wears off, I get hit by the DT DD for 20800 (32000 DT * (1-.35 spell shield)) but end up at 33% life afterward.<br />
 <br />
How is this possible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suppose you have 20k hp and sunset lands on you, it increases your hp and max hp by another 20k to give you 40k.<br />
<br />
When it wears off,  you take 32k damage, bringing you down to 8k hp out of a possible 40k hp.   Then you lose the additional 20k hp buff, bringing you down to 8k hp of a possible 20k hp, which equals out to 40% hp.<br />
<br />
Just make sure whoever has sunset is near full HP when it's about to wear off.<br />
<br />
edit: hrm, when i did the math again using your numbers, it didn't work so nicely...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I know.... and I was testing it specifically for that.  No AEs were going off at the time.  I'm 100% this is exactly how it played out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have Geomantra, so that's not coming into play.<br />
<br />
Without seeing a log file and knowing the exact buffs you had, I am at a loss to explain how you have more then 200 hitpoints left after DT fire.<br />

<br />
As for the 33% health instead of 50% health, I wonder if the percentage is being calculated incorrectly due to the numbers involved exceeding 2^15=32768.  Try to make a note of actual hp numbers in addition to percentages?  I won't get to for a few more days since our Ashengate North lockouts just expired.</div></div><hr />
