I HATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC!  If  you dislike a movie,  fine.  DONT bitch and moan about it WHILE its still going on,  or boo during or at the ending of it.  Just because you didnt like it means no one else will,  and your 10 bucks you spent does not entitle you to ruin everyone elses experience.<br />
 <br />

Ok I have decided with the publics shying further and further away from reading books,  or even knowing if a movie is based on a book (but you can be damn sure most ppl know movies based from video games!) that a new rating system need be implimented.  It will save people money,  time and make movie experiences generally better.<br />
 <br />
The system will be a 1-10 system,  and tell you how much thinking is requried for the film to be enjoyable.<br />
1 - LAWL Transformers!  (yes im hostile about this!)<br />
to<br />
10 - Be prepared to discuss this movie for days on end and watch it many more times,  finding something new each time.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
We had a couple sitting in the middle who disliked the movie so much that they started playing video games and talking on the phone,  the movie theater would not remove them until a group of us complained,  and then had to be dragged out and boo'd the entire time.<br />
 <br />
Sadly at the end of the movie another group of people started booing.<br />
 <br />
Honestly,  I cant make people enjoy a movie,  hell I dont care one way or the other except when it directly affects my experience.  I have no idea what people were expecting when they went to see this movie.  <br />

And I have to agree with you ToKu... I will never understand why people in movie theaters make such a fuss about a movie!! If you don't like it, if it is too graphic, too violent, too whatever - then leave!!! Why spoil the movie for everyone else? I have seen some movies that have made me uncomfortable, made me a little embarrassed, and made me want to fall asleep, but I would never disrupt the movie for others in the theater. What is the point of that?</div></div><hr />

Tough not to get excited and spoil something so i'll just say if you like movies like Fargo and Clockwork Orange then you'll most likely enjoy this.  I cant guarantee anything,  but as long as you go in knowing you'll have to think you should at least not hate it.  ;P</div></div><hr />

People who pull that crap should be forced to flip a coin. :)<br />

Personally, I loved NCFOM.  Just seeing the west Texas scenery on the big screen was worthy of the admission price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-26-2007, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree and disagree on several points in this thread about movies. I feel it is inappropriate to make a scene during movies. I don't mind people having to use the restrooms(it beats peeing on the floor) during movies. I watch alot of comedies, so, of course I do not mind if the audience snickers or laughs at the hilarity of a scene. There has been a few scenes that were so sad, there were some sniffles so, I do not mind things like that. But, on the full blown chattering yes, I do mind, I feel it is inconsiderate of the rest of the movie goers to do this during the movie.<br />
<br />
I feel an additional rating system is not neccessary.<br />
<br />
How I feel about booing or cheering the end of the movie is up to the moviegoer as everyone has an opinion. They are certainly entitled to boo or cheer at the end of a movie, and discuss it, what they liked, what they disliked. <br />
<br />
For example, Pirates of the Caribean: At World's End. I liked the first 2. Sure the first one had alot of wooden acting and stuff, but, overall it was enjoyable. Ok, At World's End, there was enjoyable aspects, but, the plot was blah, that was freaking stupid, at least to me. It seemed so far fetched and over the top it was just lacking in my eyes. Kinda like the Star Wars episodes 1-3.<br />
<br />
Alot of people enjoyed them, and you hear quite a varied bit of response from those that did not. Anakin was a whiny, scrawny, little prat, who basically made a quick decision on joining the darkside of the force, omg, wtfzors. Such little depth and little movement in outlining his fall from the jedi to the sith.<br />
<br />
So, I definately feel it is appropriate to walk out of a movie, or boo at the end of it, as well as cheer at the end. In other public forums, like sporting events, I love to heckle the players, if, they are playing bad, they will hear it at least I hope they do. If they do something utterly retarded, I have no compuncture to boo them, or even cheer them.<br />
<br />
Even music events, I have talked to plenty of artists after they have played, and have honestly just said .you know I really did not like your show, musical style and such. It has nothing to do with them as a person or anything, so, we both just respect each other opinions, and the funny thing is being on completely friendly terms with them as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ToKu</div><div class="date">11-26-2007, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is,  movies dont always end at the credits.  Also at the end of a movie,  ESPECIALLY one like this,  you have ALOT of assimilate and absorb.<br />
 <br />
Is it that hard to refrain from booing a movie until your at least outside of the theater itself?  Where your actions wont disrupt the people who do enjoy watching an entire movie?<br />
 <br />
The etiquite for these kinds of movies is different from say,  transformers.  Its a deep think piece,  alot of ppl reflect on the movie at the end,  discussion is fine,  but when people suddenly boo loudly it disrupts that.  When I watched transformers,  the only thought I had at the end was if I had printed my up to date car insurance policy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-26-2007, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, booing in the parking lot will certainly draw a bunch of funny looks, but again, I feel at the end of a movie is appropriate to express your feelings of a particular movie, assuming of course a movie goer didn't walk out or whatever. So, I feel they are well within their rights to boo a movie, if they didn't enjoy it. My question though was it prolonged booing or did they boo and walk out of the theatre? Did they saty all the way through the end of credits booing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ToKu</div><div class="date">11-26-2007, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats the whole point of my movie system.  <br />
 <br />
I would say 99% of the people who did not like this movie were because they didnt know what to expect.  Movies like this are the minority.  If a person was told they would be required to think,  and reflect on a movie,  would they have gone to see it in the first place?<br />
 <br />
You know if a movie is a comedy,  action,  drama,  love piece...  but typically 99% of them are not think pieces,  you can go in,  shut down your brain and just enjoy the movie at face value.  You cant do that with this movie,  the problem is that at face value the movie is enjoyable up until the end,  where it fails to get the hollywood ending.<br />
 <br />
But the second you actually think about whats not said,  about whats really going on...  the movie is completely different.  Its not longer about what is on the surface,  thats not whats important.  Its about the sequence of events,  about thinks you dismissed as &quot;boring&quot; and about dialogue more then action.<br />
 <br />
Tell a person that before they buy the ticket,  and see how many go in the first place.</div></div><hr />

I find the best reaction to an end of a movie is silence. It means the audience are attentive right to the end and then in stunned awe even as the credits roll.</div></div><hr />

I would agree.<br />

quote&quot;Thats the whole point of my movie system. <br />

<br />
It worked for Saw IV and Borat. Both of these movies, which are fairly recent, you can take at face value and/or look at the underlying themes of the movie. Then, there are movies like Pan's Labyrinth, where the ending can have you wondering was this really a girl's fantasy, or reality in a brutal atmosphere. If, it was really a reality, then, there are other considerations to take in as well. With what was required of the girl to move back as the princess of the underworld, that might mean that that requirement was quite malevolent, but, glossed over as benevolent, and on and on.<br />
<br />
 Other movies like Vanilla Sky, it can be ticky tacky. Either way, I feel the moviegoer can decide what they enjoy or do not enjoy at the theatres, maybe, they heard critics say it is an enjoyable movie, check it out and be surprised when it happens to be a movie they just did not like. This is where I feel the ratings system would be flawed.<br />
<br />
For example, Borat with the underying themes that can be pondered on, how would that get rated? Would it be rated low, do to the comical material, or higher do to more serious underlying material? Where would No country For Old men be rated? <br />
<br />
Spoilers.... next  2 paragraphs, sorry not sure how to use that button.<br />
<br />
As far as the basic plot, drug deal gone bad, guy finds $2 million dollars, then is chased around by hitmen, or in particular a hitman, based upon an event in 1980 or so in Texas, then, in 2005 a book is made about it. Pretty standard stuff. <br />
<br />
So, as far as the basic plot, it has been done before, in similar movies. then, there is the sheriff and his whole deal, older police officer noticing the changing of times, his uncle was a law enforcement agent as well, died 20 years earlier. Decides to retire and has his meditation on death thing, with his uncle during a dream set out ahead of his nephew to get a camp ready.<br />
<br />
END SPOILERS<br />

I can see why they booed at the ending.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Again this is why I said we need a rating system.<br />
 <br />
*SPOILERS*<br />
 <br />
The movie failed at face value to accomplish what is deemed a good movie,  that is closure.  If you watched the movie with your brain turned off it becomes very confusing and very boring the second that Moss died,  and in such a anti-climatic way.<br />
 <br />
Many people and a few of my friends became confused,  at first not believing he was dead up until they very end.  People rationalized that Anton would be hit by the car,  but that it would be Moss who did it and he would kill Anton and give the movie closure.<br />
 <br />
The movie is heavy with symbols and symbolism.  Moss wasnt the hero,  in fact the most moral of them all was Anton.  The story doesnt follow any sense of a traditional &quot;hollywood&quot; movie,  there are no clearly defined good and bad guys,  because the story is more a reflection of Tommy and his reflecting on his life.  The title and his opening dialogue are VERY important,  they set the stage and tone for the entire movie.  The movie wasnt about a drug deal gone bad,  it was about Tommy saying the world was becomming evil around him and he was unable to do anything about it.<br />
 <br />
The part at the end with his uncle,  he tries to rationalize it with a &quot;times were not as bad when I was younger&quot; to which he gets the story about how his grandpa was brutally murdered,  which I feel is saying that the world has always been a evil place,  and you either fight until the end or not.<br />
 <br />
Again,  had you known this was a deep movie that would require you to think about the movie would you go see it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-27-2007, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">quote&quot;Again, had you known this was a deep movie that would require you to think about the movie would you go see it?&quot;<br />
<br />
It depends, this particular movie, no. From what I have seen, and since I happened to read parts of the book, and be bored to death, I wouldn't. It just is not my style. But, certainly other movies yes, I would. This is one reason I would go see movies with underlying themes and blurred edges, to watch at face value, and have the opportunity to think allittle, that would be more entertaining. This is where movies like the Matrix, Knocked Up, Borat, like it or hate it the Da Vinci Code, do well.<br />
<br />
That is where Hollywood has gone wrong with scripts and storytelling cinematics, there just isn't great storytelling that much anymore, and consumers have the right to interesting and engaging storylines with underlying themes. And hence, why Hollywood is complaining about reduced movie goers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ToKu</div><div class="date">11-27-2007, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no right or wrong,  however most reviews ive read,  and most people ive spoken with about this are in 1 of 3 camps.<br />
 <br />
Camp 1 didnt expect a think piece,  they were looking for a Silence of the Lambs type movie.  Most ive asked said they would not have gone had they known it was a think piece,  and almost all hated it.<br />
 <br />
Camp 2 knew what to expect,  they were able to see beyond the surface because they didnt shut thier brains off the second thier butts hit the seats.  Almost all of this group loved it.<br />
 <br />
Camp 3 didnt turn thier brains off,  but either knew in advance or else saw something was up beyond the surface and thought about it.  They did not like the movie for a wide range of reasons.  These people may or may not have known in advance,  but were all willing to give it a shot.<br />
 <br />
Had people known ahead of time what the movie was about,  camp 1 would be almost non-existant in the showing,  obviously with as few theaters as this was playing in they were not out for the big money crowd. <br />
 <br />
I fall into the same boat as Bell in the movie.  I feel times are changing not for the better,  and remember better times in the past,  wether or not they reall were.  It irks me and I feel that people should have more respect for everyone around them.  We didnt make them see the movie,  and we did nothing to ruin thier experience,  so why is it ok for them to ruin ours because they dislike what they see?  Honestly it would be like me going to transformers (which I ended up being dragged to and being bored out of my mind) knowing I would hate it,  and being disruptive in spite.  I seriously wanted to ask some of these people when they planned on seeing thier next brainless movie so I could sit behind them in a cape fear fashion and pay them back.<br />
 <br />
Call me snobby,  I dont think its too much to ask that you show a little respect for others around you in public.</div></div><hr />

Well my gripe was both,  primarily the middle,  but as movies are doing more and more often,  the start of the credits isnt always the end of the movie.<br />
 <br />
I am not one of the first to walked out of a theater,  often one of the last.  <br />
 <br />
Regardless,  when the credits came on people were booing loudly.  Is it too much to ask to have the respect to wait until your at the very least,  out of the showing and earshot of people who are still sitting?<br />
 <br />
Aparantly yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I am mostly curious what those people hope to achieve.<br />
The maker of the movie is not sitting in the theatre to listen to their booing or cheering. And the personel in the theatre could hardly care less.<br />
And having an irrepressible urge to imitate a cow in the middle of a crowd tends to get one a complementary stay in the white room ...<br />
