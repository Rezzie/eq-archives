<br />
Returning druid, level 70, haven't played since PoR came out, but haven't REALLY seriously played since the Dragons of Norrath expansion.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know for a fact I'm really lacking in the spell department.  But I don't know exactly which spells I'm missing, because there is NO INFORMATION anywhere anymore about spells!<br />
<br />
There used to be great lists here, and they seem to be gone.  There used to be a great list at castersrealm, and now its some lame applet thing that provides no information on where to obtain spells.  Plus, I think it's missing most of them anyway (such as, I keep hearing about a level 71 charm, but can't find ANY information about it).<br />
<br />
And in general, any tidbits of information I do find seem to be out of date (IE, stuff is researchable now, or something)<br />
<br />
So, I'm begging, can anyone provide a link to somewhere that has a complete druid spell list/guide?  Does one even exist?  If not, would anyone here be kind enough to write out a quick summary of all the spells from, say, level 65 to 75 and how they are obtained?<br />
<br />
I'd be forever in your debt.</div></div><hr />

I thought I had looked at Alla's list before - but this link does provide links to where the spell comes from!<br />

Thanks again :)</div></div><hr />

The problem with this link is that although it gives you alot of spell information.. it doesn't tell you how to get the spell.. ie: quest, vendor, etc. That is why the link Sorrian gave is better to me because now I know where and/or how to get the spell!!</div></div><hr />

If you click on &quot;item with this spell&quot; you'll get the vendor information.</div></div><hr />
