  <br />
  Donations are for the &quot;Server&quot; and &quot;bandwidth cost.<br />
  <br />
  As of now I just purchased 2 more boards that will support &quot;Everquest 2&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. <br />
  <br />
  These boards will be seperated from the &quot;Everquest&quot; forum and become seperate boards. <br />
  <br />
  This will keep an exclusive feel for each person in each area that they desire to communicate in.<br />
  <br />
  How much did this cost? 148 bucks a pop - &quot;296.00 total&quot; out of my pocket.<br />
  <br />
  Enjoy!<br />
  <br />
  As for server cost &quot;that will all depend on you&quot; the community member. If you like to donate its up to you. <br />
  <br />
  You can either use the donate button (http://thedruidsgrove.org/forums/donate.htm) above or send me an email requesting an address that you can send it to at admin@thedruidsgrove.org .<br />
  <br />
 We have had some heafty donations by a few select users that continue to donate.. Much respect to those people.. and I appreciate those donations. As for the rest of you.. paypal is very secure and a couple of dollars here or there help ensure the future of our boards.<br />
  <br />
  What does this get you?<br />
  <br />
 One thing donations does offer is the ability to attach &quot;pics&quot; to the board using our server. This means once attached those pic's are on our server and you do not have to host them. So if you did donate in the past please contact me so I can upgrade your account if you cannot currently &quot;attach a pic&quot;. <br />
  <br />
 Other things are on the horizon that those people who donated freely will be able to use, depending on the cost VS. the donations that were made. Our hope soon is to get a Team speak server up that will allow people to talk via internet. I have had the pleasure to use this system in the past and it works great.. but first goal will be to ensure that the &quot;TDG Network&quot; is stable and works well enough to hit the new projects.. but of course these take time.<br />
 <br />
 I like to thank those community members who maintain a healthy attitude towards the spirit of the Grove. <br />
 <br />
 I like to thank our Staff for maintaining our boards... &quot;we all have real jobs!&quot; so its tuff at times and we do our best. In essence we all volunteer our time and our efforts towards maintaining the spirit of which built the Grove. I can't put into words what these guys do.. sometimes you may not agree with them.. sometimes you may say.. &quot;Mods&quot; shouldn't be able to say that!.. but remember .. we are &quot;All&quot; part of the community.. so each of us have the same right as a poster to &quot;say what we feel&quot; within the bounds of the Spirit of the Grove. <br />
 <br />
 These boards are here for you.. if you maintain a good bearing among the community.. all is well.<br />
  <br />
 I like to personally thank Rahjeir for giving his all to the new system  - he is great to work with and has the same &quot;big picture goal&quot; as I do when we dive towards the next &quot;5 years&quot; of The Druids Grove.. yes you have heard it right.. as of 6 April 2004.. we hit &quot;5 years&quot; and still the oldest class site still supported by its community!<br />
  <br />
  Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

We still need your help. Nothing is free here, so please, help keep your community going strong, do your part and donate!</div></div><hr />

How much bandwidth does this site go through on an average month (cringe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">05-24-2004, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 40 gigs if I recall right. Rahjeir can correct me if I'm mistaken. He's been following the numbers more closely than I have.<br />
<br />
This is also before the EQ2 and WoW forums were implemented. If anything that number would have gone up.</div></div><hr />
