Cleric Self only Mana buffs (not the yalp line) are 1 mana per new version as well.  The Yalp line may go up 2 per level, but, it requires them to recast frequently and be standing.  9's, Mask and a horse/lizard&gt;Cleric self buff and Yalp any day.  Let's not forget that our self buff stacks with every other buff out there and with focus and AA lasts 5 hours while giving us See invis and Ultra vision.</div></div><hr />

Why would you compare these as if clerics don't have access to horse/lizard?<br />

And would you rather have 485 extra hp, or vision enhance? Regardless, all vision spells are about to be handed out to EVERY class, through AAs -- even see invis -- so now any cleric will be able gain PERMA see invis without even having to waste a gear or augment slot. <br />

Proportionally speaking, the upgrades seem fine for me. If anything, C6 should be bumped up to 21 mana regen.</div></div><hr />

As an example, it was not until like AA 350 that I finally picked up MC3.  It would not be so bad if Forest added some other effect, like resists or EB, etc., and the OOW one added something op top of it as well.  Or if we had multiple masks the way Wizards (through AAs) have multiple Familar's, to assist with Healing, nuking, debuffing, etc.  But no, each expansion since Luclin, one of our few TOP level spells for any expansion has been devoted to giving us 1 Mana/tick more and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Yalp will not take hold while on a mount if you sit while yalp is in effect it pops.  A cleric can't get the mana regen of meditation while yalp is on period.  That's why The druid mana regen is better than the cleric regen.<br />
<br />
Look at the spell too.  10 mana for 14 mana per tic for 4 tics. That means it is in reality a 7.6 mana a tic spell for practical uses.  Not to mention that the cleric must be actively using it every 4 tics.  Not to mention that duration focus effects do not work on spells that last less than 5 tics.  On the other hand our mask spell which lasts 1950 tics (3 hours and 15min) and has a mana cost of 250 averages out to 4.8 mana a tick.  Then factor in that It stacks with all other forms of mana regen.  That Duration focus works on it making it last 5 hours. How is our mask spell inferior to yalp?  Would you trade it with a cleric?  I certainly wouldn't<br />
<br />
Also, Their Self buff that stacks with c5 and SD does not stack with 9's OR Focus.<br />
<br />
So, A druid on a horse OR sitting will ALWAYS have greater mana regen than a cleric with or without Yalp and Zealot. A cleric will have more mana regen than a druid when both are standing with no mounts.  But, the cleric has to cast the spell every 24 seconds, use a spell slot to get less than 3 mana a tic more than us.</div></div><hr />

Indoors you can't use a mount, but it still requires dedicating a spell slot and casting over and over to use yalp.  And you need to be standing 100% of the time.  all this for less than 3 mana per tic more for standing regen.  And between fights, we more than make up the difference in mana regen.<br />
<br />
You are percieving an inequity that simply doesn't exist.  I ask again, would you trade your mask spell for Yalp?<br />
<br />
I personally think that the benefits of our Mask far out weigh the drawbacks of Yalp.</div></div><hr />

1 tick = 6 seconds, not 4.  So yaulp can be extended by most focus 4 and better effects.</div></div><hr />

if anything...complain about the gross efficiency disparities...that's why we'll run out of mana first (a mixture of if both healing...they're way more efficient and if we're healing and nuking...we can only have full specialization in one of those areas while they only really need it in healing....again that's another debate)<br />
i think why it seems like it doesn't increase enough is that rangers get stalker all of a sudden at level 65 and druids then only have 1 more mana per tick than their hybrids =P....less if you count their extra mana regen aa's hehe (not really complaining about it, we can actually use our mana for more than nuking 2-3 times every 30 seconds for really inefficient results...just think that's why it seems like it isn't much of an upgrade since rangers go from 0 to 3 mana regen at 65 and we go from 3 to 4)<br />
and imo...yaulp only really supercedes druid mana regen in very few circumstances...like indoor cheal chains or indoor chain healing situations where you really can't sit down to catch a tic of meditate between casts...granted clerics already blow druids away in those things and yaulp lengthens the gap there...but /shrug i dun wanna chain cheal anyway =P<br />

<br />
Yaulp is extended by the Spellcasting Reinforcement Mastery AA.  This extends it to 6 ticks.  If you're fortunate with client/server synch you can occasionally get a 7th tick, but this is luck.<br />
<br />
You cannot use Yaulp to its full effectiveness in any environment when you're casting a lot of spells.  This is because Yaulping requires precise timing (check the duration -v the refresh time on it.)  What you usually do is Yaulp the moment the gem refreshes and you aren't doing anything else... but in a tight CH ring, the loss of ~3.5 seconds (cast time + gem refresh time) to a Yaulp can wipe the whole raid.</div></div><hr />

Mask really is much superior, because its fire and forget it.</div></div><hr />

A spells effectiveness is more then just the number crunching some are focusing on. While I agree that a different modifier could be added to it then the ultravis (due to redundancy) I think the spell is fine the way it is/has been. Our fight should be in our efficiency - not small spells to help us recover from said inefficiency.<br />
<br />
Oh, and most clerics I know dont have time - at least on raids - to even consider memming Yaulp. Thats what necros are for. ^_~</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do?  I'm impressed.  I know I would hate to have to recast that spell every 30 seconds or so.  Out of curiousity, do you cast it in all cases or just when you can't use a mount?  Are there situations where you don't use it due to high demands on healing?  Which would you, as a cleric that uses the spell, prefer?  Yalp or a fixed mana regen of 5 per tic (plus a few other benefits) that lasts 3 to 5 hours?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate mounts.  I hate the problems with ducking on them.  I do have a horse, but I can't remember the last time I actually used it in a combat situation (it was helpful for getting to LDoN's though.)<br />
<br />
Are there situations where you don't use it due to high demands on healing?<br />
<br />
Occasionally, yes.  Quite often during those intense moments when you're staring at the DvA button, willing the stupid thing to refresh, while spamming your fastest heals on the tank and hoping like mad the slower survives another few seconds till you can heal her, I'll let yaulp fade - but I refresh it when I have the chance.<br />
<br />
Generally I sit during downtime, and stand up by hitting &quot;3&quot; (which is my Yaulp hotkey).<br />
<br />
Which would you, as a cleric that uses the spell, prefer? Yalp or a fixed mana regen of 5 per tic (plus a few other benefits) that lasts 3 to 5 hours?<br />
<br />
Who cares about these other benefits?  I already have ultravision.  *grins*<br />
<br />
I'll take 5/tick fixed mana regen please.  Yaulp's poo compared to MotH or Canni.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I do.  I don't have a see invis item, so that portion of the spell is usefull to me.  I also love the much wider field of vision that it gives.  You get use to that part of it pretty fast, and it's noticable when you don't have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firemynd</div><div class="date">08-31-2004, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grendul: Good thing people know what they are talking about before they flame someone for their opinion. =o<br />
<br />
I know exactly what I'm talking about, though I'm not sure what you're calling a 'flame' ... numbers have little to do with opinion. You might not like number crunching but simple fact remains- EQ is based on numbers, so you either learn to live with the numbers and use them to some degree of benefit, or pretend they don't matter. <br />
<br />
As far as comparing the mask with yaulp, I was referring to numbers, not convenience. Sure, it is quite possible that maintainence would be deciding a factor for druids if we had a choice. <br />
<br />
Shadowfrost: That would be me.<br />
<br />
I don't blame you. It's an extra F12 (14 upgrade in OoW) when a mount can't be used (or isn't preferred), and when sitting to meditate isn't an option. I've been on many LdoNs, raids, dungeon crawls, and even exp grinds during which I couldn't use a horse yet never once sat down. It's not worth aggro while mobs are steadily incoming; not possible anyway if I'm the puller; and once I've debuffed, snared, nuked, or healed the MT, sitting would possibly ping the mob away from our tank. <br />
<br />
If I'm standing anyway, why wouldn't I click myself some mana regen? The casting time certainly isn't prohibitive, and once every 36 seconds isn't any more tedious than a tank hitting taunt, or rogue hitting backstab, a monk hitting kick, etc... and doesn't come close to bard twisting. After a while, you just get used to hitting the button between other actions.<br />
<br />
Actually, I do. I don't have a see invis item, so that portion of the spell is usefull to me. <br />
<br />
Lots of things will change within a few short months after OoW is released. Just like we generally take 'see invis' for granted because it's a component of both mask and eagle lines, most other classes will come to take it for granted when they gain see invis as a permanent ability, and no longer rely upon a buff or item for it.<br />
<br />
What used to lend value to our spells has continually been handed out to other classes over the past few years. Not that I mind so much them getting those abilities, but it does diminish the utility aspect around some of which the druid class has been balanced.<br />

Well since I don't know as much about druid mana woes I'll back out of this one, but don't think the regen should be boosted to that of yaulp since there's far more restrictions on it as is.</div></div><hr />

Find a real argument&quot;. Especially after the points youre trying to make:<br />
<br />
Cleric self buff + horse &gt; druid self buff + horse.<br />
<br />
Your question speaks for itself in your lack of understanding in the situation. You can't compare the two, because the first option is not even possible. You could argue however that the fair comparison would be mask+horse vs cleric+sitting however we all know we use a horse when sitting is a bad thing, and therefore an unlikely situation as well.<br />
<br />
Numbers of course matter - and I love number crunching. But using JUST numbers is very close-minded and may make you look foolish is all. For example, of course Yaulp+Horse &gt; MotH+Horse number wise - but its not feasible.<br />
<br />
For instance, if I were to use just numbers and compare spells I could say that:<br />
<br />
Yaulp = 48 mana returned, 10 mana spent = 4.8 returned per mana spent<br />
MotH = 7800 mana returned, 200 mana spent = 39 returned per mana spent<br />
AsoC = 36000 mana returned, 5 mana spent = 7200 returned per mana spent<br />
<br />
Or if you dont like ratio returns... <br />
Yaulp =  960 mana / 200 spent / 10 second total cast time (.5x20 casts since it would take 20 casts = 200 mana)<br />
Mask = 7800 mana / 200 spent / 3 second total cast time<br />
Necro = 1440000 mana / 200 spent / 120 second total cast time (40 casts x 3sec per cast = 200 mana - an invalid argument as it wouldnt be logical to use the mana to begin with)<br />
<br />
Using this formula, look how much better Mask appears then Yaulp now. Does that make it accurate to say that Mask &gt; Yaulp. Nope. Because there are other factors or ways to view it (do you need mana now or later for instance - Yaulp would win in an emergency situation where less time is needed - or you are playing/casting for less then 26min or so).<br />
 <br />
Balance is more then just numbers as well. And convenience would be a deciding factor when determining balance. So is mana spent, casting time, availability etc. <br />
<br />
The original question/comment is to improve the Mask Line by more mana per tick. The way the original poster stated their fact was solely number based - and of course it looks as if druids get the short end of the stick per tick. <br />
<br />
But when you look &quot;outside the box&quot; you see that there is very good reasons why it is set the way it is, and we really dont have it so bad. Its all in the twist.<br />
<br />
I just get tired of seeing the same ol' bitter druid comments (such as &quot;Better try again on that &quot;hey druids have xyz&quot; mantra we all love to hear...&quot;) Last thing I want is people to hate us for not only what we can do, but for how much we bitch that we need more.<br />

<br />
Sorry =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yaulp = 48 mana returned, 10 mana spent = 4.8 returned per mana spent<br />
MotH = 7800 mana returned, 200 mana spent = 39 returned per mana spent<br />
<br />
If you want to continue being absurd, don't forget to mention that it takes druids over 3 hours to realize that return, while it takes clerics a mere 24 seconds. Wow look, a huge disparity! heh<br />
<br />
All you're proving is that with a little effort, you can turn almost any comparison into 'apples vs. oranges' rather than look at base value of two spell lines in the same reference. Yay for you.<br />

Your own answer to rez is on test, as is your own answer to DA - but clerics still can't even get self-invis (&quot;no changes planned at this time&quot;) let alone useful nukes.  Last time I soloed in GoD, I was killing light blue undeads on Natimbi beach with my LFG flag up; last time I saw a druid solo, she was killing white-cons at the entrance to Yxtta, and she had something like half my AA totals.  Leather armour goes to twinks while plate classes are still wandering around in LDoN gear.  Rumour has it that there are as few undeads in OoW as there are in GoD, but your OoW spell set will have you charming hynids.<br />
<br />
Druids are looking like a really good class to be in OoW, and I'm afraid that I simply can't accept that Mask of the Hunter -v- Yaulp is a serious issue.</div></div><hr />

And getting more mana regen for druids out of the Dev Team stands about as much chance as clerics getting self invis...:P</div></div><hr />

The only way clerics have better mana regen is IF it's indoors where a mount can't be used AND if it is a place where you can't sit between pulls, or durring a fight.  Those are pretty big if's.  If druids are going to pick a battle, this is not one to choose.</div></div><hr />

I dont know what all of this has to do with the topic but anyways here goes:<br />
<br />
The only 2 mobs druids can solo in Yxtta are the 2 entrance animals, they cannot solo past cause mobs are unsnarable, are immune to harmo, and you cant tank them either cause they hit hard as hell. Even if you are a 10k druid you cant. <br />
Leather armor is non-existant now in the GoD world. The muramite armor all/all tags have solved the problem of armors rotting. But as for elemental and select time armor I agree with your comment.<br />
<br />
Also lets hope they don't tag Hynids as immune to charm, but of course they should cause that would make other classes not complain about it so much.</div></div><hr />

Of course getting into the Primal Caves blows the entrance for any raid/guild on your server for 3 days....</div></div><hr />
