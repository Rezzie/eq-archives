<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravnia</div><div class="date">10-02-2009, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night since there were a few groups looking for a tank for 10-man VoA I decided to spec tank and give it a try.  I have accumulated what I considered a good amount of gear.  Before starting our attempts I checked my hp which was sitting around 43k that included raid buffs, flasks and well-fed and my dodge at 40%.  The group had 3 healers, 5 dps, warrior tank and me.<br />
<br />
Within a couple of minutes in the encounter I died from a Meteor Fist hitting around 35k ... I thought it was a fluke so we tried again and the same thing happened.  So needless to say we called it quits because a new battle was starting in less than 20 minutes for WG.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if I was missing any rotation mitigation or not being properly geared for the encounter.<br />

<br />
Were you and the warrior making sure to move out of the fire on the ground?  (That's what did me in when I tried to tank him before, MT wouldn't move him and I got yelled at for taunting him out of the fire).  If you're getting pounded by meteor fists plus have the fire debuff on you- it's a recipe for disaster.<br />
<br />
Meteor fists hit hard- healers really need to be on the ball with them to keep up whichever tank has to eat them.  IIRC- they're considered magic damage, not physical(? I could be wrong), but if so, can't be dodged anyway and maybe a little fire-resist gear could help mitigate some of that damage.  Otherwise, the healers HAVE to be on the ball and focused on keeping the OT alive when those fists start falling.</div></div><hr />

I'll do a little more research and try to find out.<br />
<br />
Fire Resist gear would help considerably, I think.  415 is the FR cap, iirc...(could be wrong...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nhexus</div><div class="date">10-03-2009, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might be that the tanks was standing to far from each other. Meteorfist usually hits me for around 20k. Often a bit less with pally-aura. And as mentioned standing in fire gives a debuff that increases dmg taken? A good way to make tanking easier is to mark MT so you always stand on top of eachother.<br />
<br />
Also notised that some healers act too slow at MF. They need to cast big heals so the land directly after MF lands. If not OT is probably going to die.<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-05-2009, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed Nhex.  I still think you're geared well enough to tank him.<br />
<br />
That's really a healer fight, in all truthfulness.  The healers need to be focused and getting the tanks healed quickly right after the MF hits in order to keep the tanks up.  <br />
<br />
Because the damage is split amongst targets within 10yds (I think is the radius), it's important that when the tanks are moving the boss off of embers that they move together and stay stacked.  The debuff from the embers (from what I remember) seems to last a second or two after you move- so that might have been another reason you got hit so hard.  It's hard to say without having been there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will give tanking another try this week and let you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravnia</div><div class="date">10-07-2009, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This week went better than last, the Meteor Fist hit around 25k with 5k mitigated.  Started with 2 healers but I died around when Koralon was 40% then we went to 3 healers and downed him the 2nd try.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the inputs.</div></div><hr />
