<br />
I have removed them. Recreated them. Zoned, Logged, camped, camp desktop and I keep getting them. I'm using mostly the default UI now even. <br />
<br />
Last effort is to keep he ones with spaces and creates new ones without. Will see if that works but it's a pain. <br />
<br />
With hot keys this happens sometimes also and you have to sometimes just delete it and make another but it's not quite the same for audio triggers. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? Any others have this problem?</div></div><hr />

I keep recreating them too, but other than that haven't found a way to fix it. I also use default UI, only player window is custom.</div></div><hr />

Replace &quot;1&quot; with the name of the audio trigger set.<br />
Replace &quot;2&quot; with the character name.<br />
Replace &quot;3&quot; with the server name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something is adding the spaces at the end. I dont think its the UI.<br />
<br />
It seems random for those that get spaces. But seems to get those in the middle of the list as you view it in game the most but not always. <br />

(When you choose &quot;Save As&quot; in Notepad, at the bottom of the dialog box there should be 3 select boxes labelled &quot;File name&quot;, &quot;Save as type&quot;, and &quot;Encoding&quot;.  The &quot;Encoding&quot; box is the one I'm talking about.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However..... for no logical reason..... I edited the file again and then bade a backup copy. <br />
<br />
For some reason, so far at least, things are ok.</div></div><hr />
