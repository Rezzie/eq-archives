<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Macwood</div><div class="date">06-22-2005, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there.  I was looking for some PVP advice from my fellow druids, especially ones who have been through this kind of scenario and won.  :grin: <br />
<br />
Backstory:<br />
While questing in Tanaris with a 45 druid and 42 hunter (I was 41 at the time), an undead rogue came up to our party and started spamming duel requests with everyone.  After a while we all decided to put up or shut up, and we turned on our pvp flags.  The rogue then went into stealth and took off, for a while.  So we went back to pulling mobs for our quest, and during a large pull the rogue reappears (with his PVP flag turned on), along with another rogue, and they both quickly drop the hunter (who was at half health from fighting multiple mobs).  I quickly try to root the mob I'm fighting, but I quickly get sapped and they drop me within 5 seconds.  The other druid tried to get some damage in, but he eventually fell too.<br />
<br />
We all run back to our corpses, and see that the rogues are waiting for us to ressurect so they can tag-team each of us again.  We put some distance from each other, thinking that if they go for one of us then the other two can heal up real quick and have a fighting chance against them.  But again they went after the hunter first, and me, in my stupidity, went against them in bear form.  Needless to say I didn't last very long, again.  :bonk: After this I guess they got tired and took off to leave us licking our wounds.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, it was a bit disheartening to get beaten so badly by two rogues, especially with us outnumbering them.  But I did pick up some mistakes I made, like getting within melee range of them, and not using faerie fire to prevent them from stealthing.<br />
<br />
But are there any extra pointers someone can recommend in this type of situation?  Cause I'm itching for revenge and hope to fight the battle a bit wiser next time ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
More precisely, you were likely cheap shotted.  PCs and NPCs in combat cannot be sapped.  In any case, this is where Nature's Grasp is indespensible.  At rank 5, the next thing that hits you will be rooted.<br />
<br />
PvP isn't always a numbers game, as you've learned.  Two rogues can drop any class but a paladin in seconds quite easily.  I should know, since my first level 60 is a rogue.  With 2 on your group, some of your party at lower health, all in combat, and no mage to sheep one of them - about the only thing you and the other druid could've done is travel/cat form and run/dash away.<br />
<br />
Faerie Fire is the first spell you should cast on a rogue in most situations.  On rare occasion, when I have a rogue at range I will Root first, followed by FF immediately.  After that, Moonfire, Bear Form and tank him down.  Before PvP trinkets, I would cast Starfire on rooted PCs.  Now, just about everyone will pop the trinket to get out of it.<br />
<br />
The lack of druid dps is offset by one thing - our ability to escape virtually any class / group.  Don't be afraid to run.  Of course, if your opponent has an epic mount and you dont, they will catch you in any case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the rogue can't stun you, he's pretty gimped. He can't run away from you either as you have cat form sprint and NS/roots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true. If your opponent has an eopic mount and you don't.. he have to be out of combat to mount it. Wich means you can catform/stealth. Not a problem. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">06-23-2005, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first instinct would have been root one rogue, feral charge and bash the other rogue.  Throw up a heal or two if able to give the party some more life, drink a mana pot and go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">06-23-2005, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faerie fire and direbearform seem to be the only wayfor me to handle rogues. One thing you can do is root one and focus on the other, assuming the one who is rooted isn't a gnome and doesn't have vanish/prep up, the pvp trinkets also make things a little tougher. But improved bash and frenzied regeneration go a long way towards keeping you alive, and the longer you live the more likely you'll kill the rogue. Rogues have to kill fast, or at least keep you in stunlock because they can't handle much heat themselves. They also seem to be a bit tougher at lower levels, it seems easier for me at 57 to drag a fight out with a 60 rogue then it was for me at 40 to drag a fight out with a 40 rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have to totally agree as I have a 55 rogue as well as a druid Potions of Free Action for the win.<br />
<br />
90% of rogues don't look for this type of potion will try to stun, kidney shot etc wasting theri combo points and by that time its too late they are running out of energy and loose all their combo points.<br />
<br />
My tactic for two rogues is similiar root one rogue straight away and FF him pop on Natures Grasp, Rejuv, Drink Potion of Free Action, Bear Form and go the other rogue.  If the rogue you have rooted uses is pvp to get out of root do not worry as he can't stealth so no cheap shot.  He can't use it again so now you swap the rooted rogue from natures grasp move back.  Pop to caster root the other rogue again keeping him out of the game is key.  Regrowth and Rejuv and back to bear form and back too the rogue you where on before.  Now let your rage build up as you will use this for Frenzied Regen.  Trust me by this time this rogue is now quaffing a healing potion or using blind to try and use a bandage.  The longer you stay up the more the rogues will panic if you get a rogue down to 20% he will most likely try to run just pop out and Moonfire him to death.<br />
<br />
I am surprised your hunter didn't use scatter shot on one of the rogues also this can keep him out of action just long enough to concrentrate your firepower on one rogue and 3 V 1 rogue = Dead Rogue.  Ice Trap is also a good tactic for Hunters.<br />
<br />
These types of fights are all about crowd control contain 1 and concentrate on the other.  Use all the skills at your disposal to keep one rogue out of the action if he can't fight he is no threat.</div></div><hr />

use your pvp trinket :D it really screws some rogues up to havea  stun break early, and it gives you time to NG and or shift to bear.</div></div><hr />

How well you do in PvP will show in how much you prepared for it. i.e Freeaction Potions, Major heal pots (high drop rate in ruins of andorhal), combat potions stocked, Enriched Mana Biscuits and getting the lvl 55 water from mages, and just about any Magic absorb potion (cold and shadow usually). I usually do an hour of prep time for PvP before I actually PvP.<br />
<br />
I found that Feral charge with furor is indispensible:<br />
It keeps the healers/casters from casting, flag runners in place, used to get away (target a farther mob from the heat of battle.) so along with other suggestions I would say mix in feral charge to help crowd control with good ol' bash when available.<br />

No doubt.  Unfortunately rogues have mulitple stuns which can be deadly.  Especially when they get 2 or 3 crits in a row.  Ouch..  Tis the nature of the rogue.</div></div><hr />

Just a reminder that if you are a Tauren Druid, I think the War Stomp stun should be the first action to be taken if you are surprised by a rogue. Followed with FF.<br />
War Stomp is a life saver, and should be saved for last resorts since it has a long cool down. But if a rogue gets the surprise on you and stuns you, by the time you are out of the stun your health is low enough for drastic measures. <br />
<br />
Great thread, I learned some things. Not to mention that I forgot about my Hunter's Scatter shot skill, which would have come in handy in BG lately.<br />
<br />
By the way, I am a lvl 30 Tauren Druid currently, and a lvl 51 Dwarf hunter.<br />
Hello!! Great site you have here and a great resource for Druids.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to break the stun that the rogue initially puts you in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Free Action Poiton] &lt;-- points :D<br />
<br />
It lasts for 30 secs. If a rogue cant kill you in 30 secs the scale is tipping in your favour. They hit hard.. but they can't take much heat temselves. And with massive bear armor.. you have a very good chance of outlasting them.<br />
<br />
I can't believe how many people disregard this wonderful potion. AND rogues are used to a common approach of attack.. if it fails.. they usually panic and try to tank you as a warrior (= bad idea). :)<br />
<br />
Of course.. good rogues know this and will change teir approach.. but in my experience, 90% of rogues panic. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're Horde, Fishing next to the Zoram'Strand will give you mucho Oily Blackmouth, and there is a crapload of Stranglekelp there.<br />
<br />
I would not suggest going to Baradin Bay to fish if you're a Hordie, especially as a lowbie.</div></div><hr />
