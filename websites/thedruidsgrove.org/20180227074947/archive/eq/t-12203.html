 <br />
I am a druid from waaaaay back, who recently reactivated. I haven't played in so long that when I last visted the Druid's Grove it was on EZBoard. :p<br />
 <br />
Anyway, I could definitely be wrong, but I swear I could remember there was a guide somwhere on that old DG that listed good places and mobs to quad kite at various levels. <br />
 <br />
I'm level 57 atm, so quadding maybe isn't the best option right now (1 level below next AE DD spell), but should make 58 this week, and wondered where I might go to quad when I do. I have pretty decent mana, especially for a bazaar-geared character (255 wis) if that makes any difference.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty to pull from, and you can root DoT the casters singly.  Also, there is a new concept in EQ of &quot;hot spots&quot; (zones with an extra large ZEM, for better XP), and Scarlet Desert is one of them :)<br />
<br />
Once you get 58 and Fist of Karana (I think that's the name), you could head to ME to quad the toilers, but stay in SD and do the Tro Jegs as long as they're all dark blue.<br />
<br />
The other thing worth mentioning is that you might be better off root/rotting or charm-fighting in the PoP zones.  With the higher ZEMs and bonus XP (you get bonus XP when you are 51+ and kill mobs that are 51+ and within 5 levels of you.<br />
<br />
Oh, that reminds me of another thing! ;)<br />
<br />
Another hot spot right now is the Grey.  In the far NW corner of the zone is a small lake with giant skeletons (forget the names).  They are easy single pulls, and pretty easy to root/rot, and they are all level 55.  So you would get bonus XP, extra hot spot XP, and a relatively safe zone to hunt in.<br />
<br />
Better yet, try them all out, and see which you like best :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tallenn</div><div class="date">09-25-2005, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the answers so far. <br />

I had been quadding in SD, but not the aliens- the sun revenants on the plataeu. They are all dark blue, where the aliens were some db, some lb. Plus, they were already scowls, so I figured I wasn't hurting any important faction. <br />
 <br />
Then, I decided to try root-rotting in the Grey, and the experience was actually faster- almost twice as fast. I got the last half of 56 that way in a couple of days. I knew about the revenants in the NW corner, but didn't know about the bonus for killing mobs over 50. I will definitely try that out. <br />
 <br />
I will also head to maiden's eye to try out toilers once I get 58. <br />
 <br />
I tried root-rotting in PoN, but it took a REALLY long time to make a kill, and the exp didn't really seem that great (though admittedly, I didn't try it very long). How well does charm hold? Long enough to get both mobs low in health (or do you recommend trying to keep the pet for several mobs)? How easy is it to find charmable mobs? Actually, I was thinking of heading back to the planes once I made level 59 (cabbage). <br />
 <br />
One last thing on root-rotting. As of now, I'm using winged death, drifting death (does about as much damage as Ro but isn't resisted nearly as much) and drones from vambraces. With the mount, the cast time on the vambraces isn't really a problem. I know there are other nice DoTs, but as far as I can tell, they are all LDoN purchases that would take a LOT of LDoN missions to buy. I have LDoN, but haven't done any missions- there doesn't seem to be a lot of people doing them these days. Are there any DoTs I am missing besides those?<br />
 <br />
So, there's no list of goods quadding places, so I don't have to come back asking this every few levels? :p</div></div><hr />
