<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyte</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a fair bit of history to the debate of Druid 22 minute SoTW reuse timer, vs. the 15 minute timer of Clerics and Beastlords.<br />
<br />
You can view the discussions here:<br />
Case for reducing SoTW reuse timer (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=6333)<br />
Who would give up the DS/AC of SotW for faster reuse? (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=6340)<br />
<br />
Aaeamdar reported to us from the most recent Fanfair (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=7191&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15) with some more insight:On some druids issues. Spent most on my (sober) time attending Developer meetings and then talking to them afterwards.3. SotW. It was discussed after the last FF. They aren't changing it. At least not now. For reasons not at all understood by me, they really think the DS is a very big deal. Apparently DS &gt;&gt; more healing or Mana regen. /shrug.<br />
<br />
It looks as though SOE devs are really hung up on the power of the DS.<br />
<br />
Given this information, I believe a strictly mathematical calculation is in order.  Reducing the timer from 22 minutes to 15 minutes, and applying the same reduction to the Damage Shield component would yield a damage shield reduction of:<br />
<br />
22-15=7 [22 minutes - 15 minutes = 7 minutes]<br />
(7/22)*55=17.5 [7 minutes / 22 minutes multiplied by 55 DS = 17.5 DS]<br />
<br />
17.5 DS<br />
<br />
So if you were to reduce the timer to 15 minutes, and also reduce the DS by 18 (17.5 rounded) then you would mathematically have the same outcome of aggragate DS data over a large sample.<br />
<br />
Would you trade 18 DS (making it 37 DS instead of 55) on SoTW for a 15 minute reuse?<br />
<br />
Yes<br />
No<br />
Yes, and I would also take ZERO damage shield for the reduced timer (it doesn't mean that much to me)</div></div><hr />

The problem of damaging adds and allowing them to summon seems to more than offset the advantage of extra damage.</div></div><hr />

The DS is what makes the longer reuse time. I would gladly give up the DS for a shorter reuse time. I have never cast it for its DS component.</div></div><hr />

I still don't quite buy this...and yes, I remember who made the statement, and the &quot;math&quot; comment.  Personally, I think it is because it is a Druid ability.  The same reason we didn't get hastened MGB.   Oops...letting myself get a little bitter ;)</div></div><hr />

like SotW Mastery or something<br />
5 levels ( 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 ) reducing reuse time 10% per level. <br />
( maybe 3 levels if 11 mins asking too much. )<br />
<br />
Level1 reuse would be 19.8 mins<br />
Level2 reuse would be 17.6 mins<br />
Level3 reuse would be 15.4 mins<br />
Level4 reuse would be 13.2 mins<br />
Level5 reuse would be 11.0 mins</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaeamdar</div><div class="date">04-29-2004, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd trade away the AC part.  ;)  To me, I think it should be 15 mins. like the others, but the DS is very useful.  I use it in 1 of three situations (well, 4, but forget PLing atm):<br />
<br />
1. At a raid as part of Mass Wood/CR/Para chain. - There the timer is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
2. As part of a &quot;super&quot; DS, mostly against a GoD named (though I do it against any named/boss at raids). - there the healing is actually almost useless and the DS is everything.<br />
<br />
3. As an emergency heal while grouping. - Here, there is some minor benefit in being able to refresh faster.<br />
<br />
While I do think our ability should be 15 mins like the rest of them, I would not want to see the DS part reduced or eliminated for it.  Wood is more flexible in its application than CR or Para, though the effects of CR/Para are better at healing than Wood (plus para has mana regen).  I personally think the increased flexibility of application (like paragon) but with less than half the healing ability of CR, balances out and our ability thus, should be on the same timer.  SOE disagrees.  I guess I dsiagree they are perfectly balanced out too, because I would rather have Wood as it is now than CR (though I'd probably take Paragon over Wood).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd vote no on any downward change to the DS, and in fact, would almost certainly vote yes to an even longer refresh time if I could have an even bigger DS.</div></div><hr />
