<br />
I am a lvl 21 Druid and do not spend much time around ironforge. My latest quest however has sent me there and I Stopped by the war effort people to see what I had that I could contribute and happily found that all my leather I had saved up could now be turned in for a box of goodies and some commendations which in turn could be turned in for more goodies. <br />
<br />
Like I said this is by far not my idea I got it from someone who posted on another forum. <br />
<br />
but to my point I turned a large amount of lever in exchange for a fair amount of green items of which I used three saved one and disenchanted the rest. After disenchanting and enchanting my new acquisitions I raised my enchanting 20 points and am now a journeyman enchanter. <br />
<br />
yes I know I am a lowbie /laugh at the newb go ahead, but just thought I would share my fun. I don't farm leather I just skin what I can when I can and have been able to turn it into a source of items for the ever hungry enchanting profession.</div></div><hr />
