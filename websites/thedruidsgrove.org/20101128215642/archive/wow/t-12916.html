<br />
If you are not afraid of some respec costs, try out Berserk a bit and then take OoC for its PvE uses. Otherwise I'd go straight for OoC.<br />
<br />
Generally, as long as you have decent equipment it shouldn't really matter.</div></div><hr />

hmm just looked at the smallprint in OoC on wowhead.....its says its triggered by 'auto attacks' -  does this include abilities like mangle etc ?</div></div><hr />

For DPS kitties the burst damage is huge.  For tanks the extra threat generation for the period its active is pretty big too.</div></div><hr />

We lose talents either way.<br />
<br />
Yes it triggers only from white damage (no Mangle, Shred etc), but it had its proc rate increased. The procs per minute are the same as they were before.<br />
<br />
Berserk, while nice, just doesn't measure up to OoC in PvE, at least IMO. Is it fun to use? Definitely! But does it give you more TPS/DPS than OoC? I'd say no.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what you wanna do. For fun just spec any way you like and try out the new stuff. But if you wanna maximize your DPS/TPS, you should go for OoC.</div></div><hr />

It allows your high threat maul to hit multiple targets.  That is a big deal from a multimob threat situation.

All of my runs have been no-cc-AE-fests (which has been so fun) and berserk has really helped for that. Also with 5, 6, 7 mobs on you plus bonus rage for your swipe crits (which with it hitting 6 or 7 at once you pretty much always get at least one crit per swipe) and dodges I've found that I generally have a hard time dumping all the rage I have even without OOC procs.<br />
<br />
However, when I start leveling again I'm definitely going back to having OOC for my cat soloing, and if I were mostly dpsing right now I'd probably take OOC too.</div></div><hr />

Berserk only works for Mangle, not Maul. I guess that's what you meant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OoC is still the shiznit for kitty dps though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont think 0/59/2 is for me given my wow playing is not all 5 mans and is never any raiding.<br />
<br />
i think i need to alter it a bit to allow me some balance between bear and kitty.<br />
<br />
i'm also likely to be a slowish leveller post wrath due to RL limiting time so some kitty stuff is probably necessary for me incl OoC.<br />
<br />
thanks for all the advice though nice to hear what other people are thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only tanked Kara and ZA (and a few heroics) since the patch, so no high end stuff yet, but I stayed out of the resto tree completely.  <br />
<br />
OoC vs Beserk....OoC might win, I emphasize might, because on the T5(ZA) trash content &amp; T4 Bosses stuff I was getting hit hard enough or dodging enough to have almost perma rage, so OoC is waisted.  That being said, Maul is by far the new lacerate!  It generates sick threat.  I was generating +1200 TPS pretty consistently.  So I say take beserk for the instant uber threat on multiple targets.  Swipe will hold off healer threat but eager AoE Dps will yank them off you if you don't pop beserk.    <br />
<br />
I also use the badge Idol which procs on mangle, so having no CD on the mangle is pretty nice.  Its like a gaurenteed proc of +65 agility.  <br />
<br />
Another big decision is that OoC is deep in the resto tree and Furor is really a pretty useless PVE talent.  You just should not be shifting that much and if you do, just enrage.<br />
<br />
(ignore the talent build in my signature, it is no longer correct.  I will update it shortly...61 points feral)</div></div><hr />

I am using that idol too, but are you sure it can re-proc in this way?  Previously there was a hidden, internal 10 second cooldown.  Has this now changed?<br />

 <br />
Is Maul still an 'on next hit' type cast?  What does the tanking rotation look like now?  Something like:<br />
 <br />
Berzerk, Maul (primary target), Mangle (primary and two other), Swipe, Swipe (to get some aoe threat to keep off healers), Mangle, Maul, Mangle?  Is lacerate still used?<br />
 <br />
What's the key to keeping aggro on 4+ targets with all the crazy AoE going off?  (it's been a while since I tanked on my poor resto druid and haven't been feral since the patch =/) ty</div></div><hr />

0/52/9.<br />

i love beserk - only tried it in cat so far doing some dailys but its great.<br />
<br />
and infected wounds to is very nice.<br />

gotta try some pvp soon to try out these new talents.  also feral charge cat :)</div></div><hr />

I love berzerking which is epci for situations that you threat on multiple mobs or even unlimited mangles on a targe for quick threat.  Also I donno if people use it but I have this macro that uses mangle/maul/lacerate back to back and it doesn't have any down time in between if mangle is down it will throw up lacerate.  That my friends allows me to pull 2400 tps.  <br />
<br />
Also my spec is a kitty build so I do not have all the dodge abilities and I am pretty sure I did not pick up the armor upgrade.  I do my job off offtanking Bloodboil/Shazraz/and Supremus.  My spec is on armory.  I am Moviefone from chogall.</div></div><hr />

pull lots of mobs and just kitty dps them all to death with half price moves :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only time i thought furror was viable pve was in the following situation. Before a boss fight I'd shapeshift humanoid, cast regrowth, rejuv, then bear enrage, and run in for my FF, maul/mangle combo for initial threat. I **think** the added healing agro really gave me sick TPS plus extra healing. I base this on my baby tank was still wearing some blue gear and was still able to pull 1750 tps spike **prepatch**. but i heard a horrible rummor that self heals don't generate threat so maybe i just had good luck with crits. Either way the extra healing wasn't horrible. and furror helped give me extra rage when i initially ran in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given the current threat build and rage consumption I think you are much better off with Beserk.  Poping Beserk and spamming mangle actually builds threat and RAGE at the moment...I know it doesn't make much sense, but it does.  I expect this to be nerfed soon, but for whatever reason (I think its the sick amount of crits) when I am tanking and pop Beserk, my rage bar is racing to full!  I strongly reccomend staying out of the resto tree until Wrath if you want to main tank.  OoC is very nice but VERY VERY expensive.  11 points that could be used in the feral tree to get to it.  And all you are getting is lower shift costs and +rage on shift.  Powershifting bears are done, stick the points in feral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, hold on there.  You also get Naturalist and Furor on the way up the tree.  Naturalist is a flat 10% damage -- and threat via damage boost.  It's still a very good ability.<br />
<br />
Furor's now a little iffier, but after playing around with it, I like it.  There's a lot more overlap between tanking and dps gear now for most druids, and that means with a tank gear set, you can probably do reasonable DPS in catform when it's appropriate.  With Furor, when you pop into catform, you now have a full energy bar and can go to town immediately rather than needing 10-15 seconds to ramp up into a DPS rotation.  It's more of a PvP-heavy talent now than it used to be, and less vital, but it's not a waste.</div></div><hr />

This still only can proc once every 10 secs, but is an almost gaurenteed proc when you are mangling every 1.5 secs. (or less w/ haste)</div></div><hr />

Kinda funny...on Tidewalker the other day I did 1270 dps in cat...with a 0/59/2 spec tanking spec...and still got absolutely crushed by our rogues, hunters, boomkins, ret pallies, etc...they did 50% more dps.</div></div><hr />

Glyph of Maul), you'll do more DPS in bear than cat on 2 or more targets, I think.  I ran #2 on the DPS meter the other night, and I was in bear most of the evening.  The Prot Warrior was feeling kind of ragestarved most of the evening, but on the single target bosses, I went kitty for him to shine.</div></div><hr />

OOC procs more often now and is a free attack that does not use Energy or Rage, think Free Double Maul with glyph of maul!<br />
<br />
I will have beserk by lvl 74, and that wont take long to get to, since I probably wont be doing heaps of group tanking while I level, I dont see this as a major problem.  I am anticipating most of the instance runs worth doing will start from lvl 73 or so anyway.</div></div><hr />

in SM Cath in the big room where u fight Mograine? and decided to just kill him despite only killing half a dozen of the mobs in the room - yet my old brain seemingly telling me that if u dont clear the room they all join the party when u attack the boss...<br />

sure enough i get him and about 15 or so others.....bear...beserk and swipe ftw.<br />
