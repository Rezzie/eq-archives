I went to Unrest, slipped into my wolf skin, and got a big surprise :) I'm guessing wolf form no longer changes your faction anywhere? I tried a few other places as well, and so far that's true. Just wanted to make sure before I zone into kittytown and get massacred!<br />
 <br />
Edit: I can't search because the search engine tells me the words &quot;wolf&quot; and &quot;form&quot; are too short or too common.</div></div><hr />

I remember finding this out running up to Maru's Seru and shifting to wolf form at the guards.  I was level 20 something... didn't last long.<br />
 <br />
I don't remember when Halas and Unrest were added... before my time.</div></div><hr />
