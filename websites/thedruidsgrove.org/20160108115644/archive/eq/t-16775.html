My mage friend and I have duo'd crystallos (including elder nameds).   We started doing it when we were partially TSS raid geared so only around 16k mana~ or so I'd say.  important thing however is AAs.  mage really needs to have all his pet defensive AAs, Pet HP, Fortify companion maxxed.  Pet healing AAs help too. Air pet for stuns and rancorous servant, druid healing = win. Can pretty much take on anything that doesnt spawn adds or doesnt have too much HP (squires are too hard for duo, but have done squires in a group before with mage pet tanking it the entire time)</div></div><hr />
