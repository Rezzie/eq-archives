I am still new to being a druid(have power levelled her and have been run thru dungeons by 70s..lol) as she is my 3rd alt(side project) after a 70 lock and 70 rogue...needing to do something other then DPS for a change and i have liked doing the bit of healing with her so far and tanking just doesnt sound attractive to me.  I am aware that it will be a crash course in druid healing thru outland dungeons but I am up for the challenge.<br />
<br />
Here is her armoury as it sits now:<br />

MotW in your resto tree and then proceed by maxing out Naturalist. Afterwards pick up Omen of Clarity and max out Intensity (3/3) and drop a point into Subtlety which would leave you with 1 more talent point before you hit 70 and respec to whatever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">12-28-2007, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea. I don't believe in respeccing/wasting gold to min/max for leveling unless you specced something really anti-leveling which you did not. It's not that noticeable to have the &quot;best&quot; spec.<br />

ps. I'm actually from Coquitlam but I always just put Vancouver ;D</div></div><hr />

I will give it a go and see how i do...thanks for the replies :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it comes to respeccing, don't waste your gold. Once you get into Outland 5g isn't going to be that big a deal, but still. My 65 paladin, for instance, has been respecced precisely one time in the 10 days /played I've spent on her.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm like a junkie with the talent calculator (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent). :) I seriously use it like twice a day every day, even when I don't actually log in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">12-31-2007, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Balance is the best spec to &quot;fake it&quot; as a healer in instances.  If you put your 41 points in Balance and the rest in resto, you can easily heal any of the pre 70 instances.  Ferals can do it too, but typically we don't carry the gear.<br />
<br />
At high ends though you can swap pretty seamlessly.  My feral druid tanks and heals in Kara.  I tank when we need two tanks and heal on very specific fights (Maiden, Prince) where needed.</div></div><hr />

=( People have been able to do that since Armory came out, but since 2.3 they don't even have to alt-tab. I really don't understand why people (used to) do this. Y'know, shammys standing around in ele gear when their real gear and spec is resto. Wtf.<br />
<br />
I know that hybrids can specialize in any direction available to that class, but that doesn't mean ferals should be main healing Ramps. Every time something like that has happened to me it's ended in a series of increasingly frustrating wipes until everybody's mad at each other and goes home.<br />
<br />
Seriously ask a drood/paladin/shammy if they're geared and spec'd for healing before you just send them an invite. Ask LFG for a tank if you need one, don't just assume a holy pally will work. Nothing is more infuriating than a fury war trying to tank.</div></div><hr />

What i was originally thinking was putting half the points in balance and half the points in resto...that I way I still have good talents to heal but wont be lacking in dealing damage when trying to level....cause i dont want it take forever to get to 70.<br />
<br />
Or....can you guys tell me is it rough to level going full resto or should I not worry about it.<br />

Also the one thing I am finding that I go thru mana so fast I spent half the time drinking....grrrr....it could be due to some crappy gear...so i will hold on till i start getting more quest rewards in Hellfire before getting too frustrated with that.</div></div><hr />

The best boomkin raiding spec is 40/0/21 hybrid. And I've heard of some resto droods going deep into balance for Lunar Guidance or even Dreamstate. Feral's a different story, but for balance and resto you have to go hybrid. Balance should be hybrid for both levelling and endgame, resto probably just for levelling but you can definitely argue for some hybrid resto specs.</div></div><hr />
