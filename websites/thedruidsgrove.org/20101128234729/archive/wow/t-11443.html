<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
- Due to various talent changes, all Druids will have all their talent points refunded.<br />
- &quot;Feline Swiftness&quot; has been renamed &quot;Feral Swiftness&quot;. The dodge % increase now also applies to Bear and Dire Bear Forms.<br />
- &quot;Improved Moonfire&quot; has been reduced to 2 ranks, for a 5/10% bonus.<br />
- &quot;Insect Swarm&quot; has had its damage on all ranks increased. The mana cost of ranks 1 and 3 has been increased. The mana cost of ranks 4,5 and 6 has been decreased.<br />
- &quot;Nurturing Instinct&quot; now grants its benefit at all times, but the bonus has been reduced to 25/50% of Strength.<br />
- &quot;Improved Starfire&quot; has been renamed to &quot;Celestial Focus&quot; and now also increases the chance to resist casting pushback when casting &quot;Wrath&quot; by 25/50/70%.<br />
- &quot;Blood Frenzy&quot; benefits have merged with &quot;Primal Fury&quot;.<br />
- &quot;Improved Leader of the Pack&quot; has been reduced to 2 ranks for 2/4% total health healed.<br />
- &quot;Pounce&quot; no longer requires the druid to be behind the target.<br />
- &quot;Barkskin&quot; is now usable while stunned.<br />
- Druids now need substantially less agility per dodge.<br />
- &quot;Dire Bear Form&quot; armor bonus increased to 450% and health bonus changed to a 25% percent health increase instead of a flat increase.<br />
- The Health bonus of &quot;Bear Form&quot; has changed to a 25% percent health increase instead of a flat increase.<br />
- &quot;Swipe&quot; has had its threat bonus multiplier removed.<br />
- &quot;Maul&quot; has had its threat bonus multiplier changed to a flat value similar in threat per time to &quot;Heroic Strike&quot;.<br />
- &quot;Regrowth&quot; has had its mana cost reduced by approximately 18%.<br />
- &quot;Tree of Life&quot; healing bonus now increases the healing received by your party members instead of the healing dealt by your party members.<br />
- The &quot;Tranquility&quot; base amount healed per second has increased by approximately 273%. The radius of effect has increased from 20 yards to 30 yards. Mana cost has increased by 40%. The Cooldown has increased from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. The Duration has decreased from 10 seconds to 8 seconds.<br />
- &quot;Mangle&quot; will not stack multiple copies from multiple forms or druids anymore. This was never intended behavior. The percentage modification on bleeds has increased from 25% to 30% and &quot;Mangle&quot; now increases the damage from &quot;Shred&quot; as well. In addition, &quot;Mangle&quot; will now benefit from the damage boost from &quot;Tiger's Fury&quot;.<br />
- &quot;Enrage&quot; will now show up in the combat log and in floating combat text.<br />
- &quot;Lifebloom&quot; will now correctly consume clearcasting.<br />
- &quot;Predatory Instincts&quot; has had its tooltip adjusted to indicate it only works in feral forms, and that it increases damage by a percent, not damage bonus by a percent.<br />
- If a spell is resisted, it will no longer break stealth.<br />
- &quot;Tree of Life's&quot; bonus healing aura will now reactivate correctly when &quot;Banish&quot; wears off.<br />
- Shapeshifted druids will now be able to speak to npcs while shapeshifted. (It always bugged me that we could pick plants and skin but not talk).<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
- The druid Restoration Talent &quot;Tree of Life&quot; healing buff is no longer being removed from the Druid if afflicted by a &quot;Banish&quot; spell.<br />
- &quot;Moonkin Form&quot; and &quot;Tree of Life&quot; form now have a casting animation for &quot;Warstomp&quot;.<br />
- The druid talent skill &quot;Tree of Life&quot; now has a swimming animation.<br />
- Adjusted the tooltip for Barkskin to reflect the proper functionality.<br />
- &quot;Insect Swarm&quot; Rank 6 will now benefit from the clearcasting effect from &quot;Omen of Clarity&quot;. <br />
<br />
This priest bit affects us as well:<br />
<br />
Priests<br />
<br />
- &quot;Mass Dispel&quot; will no longer cause stealthed Rogues and prowling Druids to lose stealth.<br />
<br />
The following item changes all affect Druids.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
- &quot;Idol of Ferocity&quot; now increases &quot;Claw&quot; and &quot;Rake&quot; damage instead of reducing energy cost.<br />

- &quot;Idol of Health&quot; now provides bonus healing on &quot;Healing Touch&quot; instead of reducing its cast time.<br />
- &quot;Wushoolay's Charm of Nature&quot; now provides haste rating instead of reducing &quot;Healing Touch&quot; cast time.</div></div><hr />
