Mathrengyl Bearwalker (druid trainer) nor Dendrite Starblaze (moonglade) will talk to me about this quest. I have nothing in my quest log pertaining to this quest line to abandon.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had this happen? :eusa_booh</div></div><hr />

I think they give you the first step (which is just to report to Moonglade) that you need to get started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just want to add to all your problems about this.....<br />
I am lvl 28 Druid and have attempted this quest for the first time about 5 levels ago and have tried it a few times since.<br />
<br />
I started my Druid with all the quests in Elowin forest...read about bear form and aquatic form so went to Darnasuss to get them.<br />
Bear form not a problem.<br />
<br />
Started the aquatic form quest from the guy in Darmasuss....went to the moonglade guy and got the quest there.<br />
Dived down in lake...found chest first pop...took it to the shrine.....activated the Bauble thingy....talked to the person......Here is where it gets weird...<br />
Had to talk to the guy at moonglade to get the second part of quest (pendant bits).....quest log came up of what I was to do.......I accepted it......but it is MISSING from my quest log!!!!!<br />
Went to Thotbot to research of what to do next.....as i thought i may be able to do the rest of the quest anyhow.<br />
found where the 2 cheats were......talked to the griffon person in moonglade first....but she had no dialog about the quest...neither did the other guy!!!<br />
<br />
Sooooo....swam alot and found the chest near Auberdeen.....cant open it (no interaction)!!!!<br />
Found the chest near Westfalll.....same deal no interacton and cant open it!!!!<br />
The silliest thing is that I cant even abandon this quest as it is missing in my quest log....and nowone in Moonglade or Darnasuss has any dialog about it!!!<br />
<br />
PLEASE can someone help  me....as I want aquatic form and it seems this quest is going to be the bane of my exhistance!!!<br />
LOL<br />

You may want to just go around and try talking to all the quest NPCs in the chain.  Failing that, I would petition a GM.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Serriously though ... there was an error before that made it impossible to complete for some people. That has been fixed but you need to petition a GM to reset your quest status for that particular quest. They will be more than happy to do it if you don't have your aqautic form and there you go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikeMac</div><div class="date">03-04-2007, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For what its worth, The quest's first phase involves a time limit to complete. When I first tried it (at lvl14?) I got killed and the item I needed disappeared from my inventory and Dendrite Starblaze would no longer talk to me.<br />
At Lvl 17 I completed a poisoned deer quest in Darkshore that I had to report to Dendrite. This time, when I talked to him I had two options: &quot;?&quot; re: the poison quest and &quot;!&quot; for the Aquatic form quest. (The Quest reappeared).<br />
I'm not sure if it reappeared because I finished the Poison quest or because you have the opportunity to do the quest every time you make a Level.<br />
In any event it all starts with the second floor trainer in Darnassus.</div></div><hr />
