<br />
 I recently hit exaulted with CC and got my Mace of Unending Life. I cant decide which enchant to go with, +15 str or +22int. I am currently 1/41/9 spec and loving it. My AP is 1200, crit % is 22, and my mana pool is sitting at 4400.<br />
<br />
 I know the str will give me more attack power but I keep thinking that as a &quot;Hybrid&quot; the int has more value.</div></div><hr />

Guess I have never been to concerned about it to be honest. I know that burst dps is important in pvp but I have never noticed lack of crits being an issue. I have however wished several times that I had mana for just one more shift.<br />
 <br />
 Definately gives me more to think about though. Thanks for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">22 int. It's better with HotW. As that weapon is &quot;allround&quot; (ie good in any form with some builds) you can get AGI or STR from other stuff with some customization.<br />
<br />
But it all depends on playstyle and build tbh. But my advice is +22 INT. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats kind of my way of thinking Goa. Im 1/41/9 spec but i tend to play a hybrid style, I shift alot and I heal alot. Guess thats why I like the Feral spec so much. It seems, to me anyway, that it gives you much more flexability in the roles that you play.</div></div><hr />

Thats not much, but it definitley adds up.  I'd probably go wiht the str enchant, but it really depends on your playstyle.  I carry around a couple weapons and change them out in combat depending on whats going on.<br />

I've never really been a fan of Int enchants, cause once you blow through the 220 mana that the enchant gives you on top of your existing mana pool, you dont really get anything out of it.  (yeah, well, i guess some spell crit).  I look at it as basically a free rejuv.<br />
<br />
Though for a true hybrid weapon, where theoretically you'll be regening your mana to full before you shift out again so that you get to utilize that additional 220 mana, its a toss-up..</div></div><hr />

The 22 INT enchant gives you 330 mana, and if you have 5/5 HotW you get 396 mana.</div></div><hr />

I could have sworn it was 10 mana per 1 int, but its actually 15 mana / 1int?  And yeah, didn't calculate HoTW.  I'd still go with str personally, but thats just me.</div></div><hr />
