&quot;Druids as a class take a lot more patience to really be effective in PvP.&quot; He said. &quot;But in watching how the Druid is actually played in PvP, we realize now that we need to do something to improve the Druid's punch.&quot; <br />
<br />
Unfortunately Warlocks are their current priority...<br />

Certainly on my server the top ranked pvpers are warlocks, the issue to adress isnt that they arent powerful.  Its that warlocks are overly complicated to play well in pvp.<br />
The issue of giving the druid more punch comes as a surprise to me.  Yes we lack damage output of a high nature without burning serious mana but.... actually there is no but, roll on the patch.</div></div><hr />
