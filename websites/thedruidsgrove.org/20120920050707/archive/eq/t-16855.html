 <br />
It adds +50 to your limit, but not to your skill. You need to skill up to actually get a skill increase. <br />
 <br />
Even if you are at the 200 max, the AA will add 50 to your forage limit and raise it to a whopping 250. <br />
 <br />
I've only had mine a little while but I spent few days specifically foraging and running around waiting for my skill to go up and all those misty acorns to fall into my hands.  It didn't happen.<br />
 <br />
My skill has gone up a mere 2 or 3, and while it was probably only a few hours of foraging, I can tell you it's going to be a long wait to skill up to 250. <br />
 <br />
It took a while just to get that 1st skillup to 201 but it eventually came and I could let my breath out. <br />
 <br />
I was in Misty Thicket this morning for half an hour before work, and I actually got 2 ground forages of misty acorn, I've never had more than one in a day it seems to me, and I had no real forages of misty acorn /sigh. This was even with my foraging machette. But that's another problem</div></div><hr />

Ah, there' s a nice thought...............<br />
 <br />
edit:<br />
Aww, just tells me I'm more skilled then he is. Talking to Reebo in Rivervale. I Talked to 3 of the guildmasters too.<br />
 <br />
ok, the GM in POK is more skilled. Got it to 248 before I ran out of skill points. Interesting, I never knew their skill levels differred. EXpensive. I think I spent 5K or so.<br />
 <br />
Excellent Idea to pay for lessons</div></div><hr />
