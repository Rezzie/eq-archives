<br />
1) Very high mob HP, no animals to charm, and complete DPS stagnation for solo druids implies that we will have terrible trouble in that department.<br />
<br />
2) Healing might be a decent group role (the class is capable there now), but clerics got a seriously spruced up set of abilities there, and cleric + robot will be sufficient.  So I see our group healing as &quot;if a cleric isn't around&quot;, which is far from healthy.  The nuke while heal thing would be handy if it wasn't common to all priests.<br />
<br />
3) Melee dps ramped up, druid dps did not, and druid utility is still minimal - group wolf form is a marginal plus, we didn't get consolidated atk debuffs, etc.<br />
<br />
It's going to be a hard winter for druids who aren't in raid forces or who don't have dedicated guild groups.  Those will be charity invites or ones made because a cleric isn't around.  I'm just not willing to support this degree of neglect by SOE any longer.<br />
<br />
Another note, by the way, is that I've lost faith in the strategic judgement of the developers.  I love the idea of meaningful group content, but designing an expansion so that solo/duo people can't get anywhere - immediately after one where everything could be obtained by boxing with a couple of mercs - is also simply begging for trouble and a subscription exodus.  Games have to support multiple styles, and the time investment in high-end toons is simply too high for new players or for people to reroll old ones.<br />
<br />
I can't post over there any more, but wouldn't mind a x-post to get some reaction.  The fact that we're seeing such limited discussion from druid players  is significant.  I don't know if the druids in beta lost an argument about class dps/utiltity or didn't make it (suspect the former), but the results are the same and they've going to be measured in wholesale abandonment of the few remaining druid mains.</div></div><hr />

From the few posts I've seen of developers, the intention of Underfoot is Tank/Cleric/Chanty (or Bard) for all zones.  Druid heals were purposely not scaled for content (during Beta at least).  Druid's do have a nice spot for back up healer though, so take that as you will.  That's if the Shaman doesn't beat you to the group to free the Chanty up to focus on CC b/c of all the wondering mobs and no &quot;true&quot; camps.<br />
 <br />
Druid's should be in high demand for back up heals and ATK debuffing though (Just make sure you list your attributes in LFG).  Just like GoD, Druids shined as back up healers and evac specialists.  And Underfoot is shaping up to be GoD 2.0<br />
 <br />
Also note:<br />
A) The expansion isn't live<br />
B) Many things can change before it goes live<br />
C) They still can patch the content multiple times after release (They did this for GoD 1.0, I think GoD is on version 1.4 or something)<br />
D) The exodus you and I are expecting may cause them to re-think Underfoot after release causing &quot;C&quot; to happen much faster.</div></div><hr />
