<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phalia</div><div class="date">02-28-2008, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly new to playing a druid.  I've only been playing her for a few months.   I'm resto specced, and play always with a paladin tank and a rogue.  I'm almost 65, and starting to look ahead.  I'm looking at doing the OL dungeons, and looking ahead toward heroics.  My question I guess is, should I look at getting PvP gear?  Or is it crap for PVE?  I've looked up a lot of druids on the armory, and I rarely see any wearing pvp gear, so I'm guessing it's not something I need to worry about, but I am second guessing myself.  I really would like you're opinions, please.<br />

Thank you in advance!<br />

Plus item points are spent on +res, +sta and additional armor which aren't really needed by a PvE healer.<br />

That said, it can make for some nice gear to fill in the gaps while you wait for a &quot;true&quot; PvE piece (from a long quest chain and/or a dungeon drop).  Check out he nearly free &quot;starter&quot; PvP sets (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemsets&amp;filter=cl=11;ta=21) that will be made available once 2.4 is released.  You just need to be honored with several PvE factions in order to purchase them.  And that takes very little (if any) effort, just a bit of planning.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Now that I've looked at more of the caster/Resto PvP gear, it appears to be junk for PvE.  You'd be better served buying &quot;of the Prophet&quot; , &quot;of Intellect&quot; , &quot;of the Elder&quot;, or &quot;of the Owl&quot; gear from the AH.  That said, PvP gear is nice for Feral PvE.  But that's not what you are asking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slightly longer answer...you will end up with more Stamina than you need, and not enough Spirit.  This can be addressed with gem choices, though...<br />
