Seriously tho, go get a real group, get some input going to SoE on our spells so we can hopefully get some changes made....before the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Still, the spiders are good solo or group, as are bears. Nice no faction hits and start at amiable (bears and wolves at any rate)...<br />
<br />
With regard to feedback, I cant ever use rain spells in groups so have no idea what they are like :). As for other spells, when I stop fizzling I´ll be sure to let SoE know... !<br />
<br />
Im so far really liking the outdoor zones in general. Lots of room, lots of animals, and so far a decent range of quests seem to be appearing. Just a shame new levels make old stuff &quot;trivial&quot; before most guilds are done with them.</div></div><hr />

This is assuming the charm lasts longer than 5 seconds!  I've tried this at level 71 against DB wolves in Icefall and great if charm holds for a little while, but at 960 mana a cast (tier1) this starts chewing up the mana pool when have to cast 5+ times to kill two DB mobs.<br />
 <br />
It was fun to play around with but I haven't found it as a viable exp method yet - also tried mammoths and bears.</div></div><hr />

It was a southern ridge drake that summoned me.</div></div><hr />

Where are the Spiders in Icefall?  I found a few using track inside a crevice on the East side but it doesn't look like there is much room there to kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilluen</div><div class="date">10-02-2006, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two ways to get to the spider area. The south canyon is easiest and has no mobs but you need lev. You can enter the south canyon at the south bears camp (by the ruins). The map shows an impass in the south canyon but that's only an issue if you don't have lev. The north canyon contains mobs, some of which see invis. You enter this canyon at the north bears camp.<br />
<br />
If you come through the south valley you'll first encounter the goblin pit. Climb above the goblin pit and you'll see the spiders area. If you come from the north you'll see the spiders area first.</div></div><hr />
