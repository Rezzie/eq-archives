I do not know what prompted this question, but I have to say that I am still shocked when somebody lies to me. Sadly I am not surprised anymore :(<br />

If you lie to somebody you do not respect that person, and I do not think that is ever acceptable, even if very few people seem to care about respecting each other anymore, and thus do not hesitate to lie :(<br />
