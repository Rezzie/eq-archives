<br />
i dont raid so its just for me to go along to some guild heroics.<br />
<br />
wot gems should i be looking at :<br />
<br />
+stam<br />
+spell damage<br />
+spell penetration<br />
+spirit<br />
+int<br />
+spell hit<br />
+spell haste<br />
<br />
what are the top 2/3 of those for running heroics....<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-11-2008, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As always... spell hit till capped... then I generally look for pure spell damage and spell crit.  Beyond that... nothing else seems to matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-11-2008, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok spell hit even for running just heroics ?<br />
<br />
wot is the spell hit cap ?<br />
<br />
spell penetration is what exactly ?<br />
<br />
and not worth going for spell haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-11-2008, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell penetration is a worthless stat for PvE.<br />
 <br />
It effectivley negates spell resistances (e.g. the buff to all resist that druids get from MoTW, or a priests prayer of shadow protection, etc.) There are very few mobs in the game that have any kind of built in resists. (none that I am aware of in heroics, only ones I can think of are the fel hunters in Hyjal and maybe 1 or 2 in BT)<br />
 <br />
Spell cap is 16% for lv 73 mobs (bosses in heroics), which works out to 203 hit without any talents. Boomkins get a talent that increases their chance to hit by 4% or so (Balance of Power), so you'll only need in the neighborhood of 120 hit. I'll look around for the exact numbers. <br />
 <br />
Spell haste is great and will increase your dps, though it will definitley make you oom faster. OOMing shouldnt be a problem on heroic trash, but some of the longer boss fights might be tough. Also, you will need a lot of haste to notice a difference, and unless you are farming ZA I don't know where you'd get it.<br />
 <br />
I'd go:<br />
 <br />
+spell hit<br />
+spell dmg<br />
+spell crit</div></div><hr />

<br />
not looked at talents yet so.....<br />
<br />
whats a good starting oomkin build ?  for heroics not raiding?<br />
<br />
<br />
ok sounds like for heroics i wont worry about spell haste.<br />
<br />
ok hit then damage and crit is it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-11-2008, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spell hit for Boomkin has always been 153.  <br />
<br />
Personally I would think the build is about the same for heroics and raiding, but that's just me... I don't do that many heroics.</div></div><hr />

http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xcrzicsTuVoZxMIx<br />
 <br />
Mana regen and threat reduction (both big issues for moonkin) plus all the fun dmg / crit increasing talents.  <br />
 <br />
Any other experienced moonkins let me know if my build is off, or feel free to suggest a better one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
still looking to get the Spellstrike set and then respec and give it a try just ot see what damage i can do, what i can bring to a heroic and more importantly what fun I can have with it as an individual.<br />
<br />
cos for over 3 and a half years i've always enjoyed playing as feral and have never ever been any other spec since the day Wow started (nor even in the Final Beta!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-12-2008, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boomkin can be a hell of a lot of fun.  I swapped and I'm having a ball.  Boomkin is all about the rotation.  Get your spellrotation and know when to spam Wrath and when to use Starfire and you're golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-12-2008, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so when to spam wrath and when to use starfire ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-12-2008, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah so generally on trash you can spam Wrath because the wind up on Starfire is just TOOO long.  You'd be lucky to get more than one or two hits with Starfire.  The down side is that Spamming Wrath will typically cause you to go OOM really fast.  So you have to plan for sitting down and drinking a lot in between trash pulls.  For quick burn down situations you want to use Wrath if you can.  For boss fights typically because they are longer you need to be spamming Starfire.  If you don't use Starfire you'll go OOM about half way through the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-12-2008, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which has a higher dmg coefficient, wrath or sf?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-12-2008, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm good question... I honestly don't know.... I'd think since Wrath is a 1.5 second cast that it would technically have a lower damage coefficient.  I know that when your crit gets high enough Starfire hits like a ton of bricks.  I see 5.5k crits regularly, but.... again In the time it takes to fire off 1 starfire, you can fire two Wrath.  So assuming all things stay equal you are doubling your chances for a crit to land.  So Wrath regularly hits for about 1.2k.  Starfire hits for about 2.5k.  So if you get even one Wrath crit you are up over the damage the starfire would hit with... there's some pretty beefy math in there, but Wrath spam is technically the highest DPS, but I think its also the highest mana use as well....</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats more points in resto than i was expecting for an oomkin build ?<br />
<br />
well i've now got the spellstrike set, the belt of blasting and i picked up the charlottes ivy - could use the other one of the set - the ring iirc.....<br />
<br />
ok its all gemmed with +hit and +damage mainly.<br />
<br />
i cant really find a build i like !  some of those Resto points seem a waste ?<br />
<br />
3 in Natural Shapeshifter ? 2 in Nature's Focus ? I'm even wavering towards 5 in Furor for those times i may need/decide to go feral......<br />
<br />
The early couple of ranks of Resto dont really help do they - its just you have to have 10 points to be able to choose Intensity and Subtlety !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furor (Restoration): Now increases your total Intellect while in Moonkin form by 2/4/6/8/10%<br />
<br />
validates my wavering towards choosing :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um yeah... that's pretty much a no brainer.  Sorry Resto druids you are on your own for having that beefed up MotW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-15-2008, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah indeed Alla.<br />
<br />
gonna read some more about the balance changes.  do like the look of starfall though.<br />
<br />
but i'm gonna miss my big bear butt meat shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-15-2008, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah.. that and the removal of Hurricane's cooldown is going to make Druids pretty on par for AOE packs.  In fact they've nicely taken away most of our issues....<br />
<br />
1.  CC anywhere?  Check<br />
2.  AOE anytime?  Check<br />
3.  Mana Regen?  Check<br />
<br />
Can't beat that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-15-2008, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i've respecced and just tried out oomkin for the first time in netherstorm going to collect a few sunfury signets cos they sell so well...<br />
<br />
omg its weird being a caster after being feral since day 1 !<br />
<br />
help !<br />
<br />
i now see 3 mobs coming towards me and i wanna run away scared ! :o<br />
<br />
i guess i will get used it to but is multi mob killing that much more difficult in oomkin than feral ?<br />
<br />
more use i guess of cyclone / roots cos having 2/3 banging away at me at the same time is not healthly for a starting out oomkin with not many HP or mana ! lol.  and i'm gonna need to carry more food/mana pots or something as it goes down fast.  gonna be more downtime along the lines of a mage i guess...not used to that !<br />
<br />
i'm used to killing stuff fast, having 12k hp in kitty form, and being able to take on 4 at a time......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">09-16-2008, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can try some of your Cat gear while in moonkin form when fighting 3 mobs. Stand at max range and hit the closest with Starfire. Root a different one as they run to you. IS and MF the other two and wrath spam them down. The reason I say put on Cat gear is to beat on the two in melee range. You won't be drinking you'll be regenerating mana while meleeing. You might have to reroot the one you cc'ed to cast a few heals on yourself or you might not. <br />
<br />
I used to be afraid to get beat on when I first respec'ed to Moonkin cause I was Resto the whole way. Now I grab my 2hander and stand toe to toe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-16-2008, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but if i put on feral gear it will mean even less mana and spell damage ?<br />
<br />
and i am not sure it will make a lot of difference to doing melee damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">09-17-2008, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll probably have less mana but you'll gain survivability and mana regen. I practiced this farming leather as I built my skinning skills. Remember in Boomkin form you regen mana on melee hits based on AP. It always seemed odd to me and isn't very useful in anything other than dailies and farming but I never have to drink or eat when I do it this way.<br />
<br />
Balance it out with Feral gear and ummmm Balance gear. Put on your big two hander with a lot of damage and AP. Maybe some AP pants and gloves to mix it up a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-17-2008, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm ok i'll give it a try....<br />
<br />
wot sort of AP value is good to aim for ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-18-2008, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well we wanted to run a heroic last nite so i respecced to feral again !<br />
<br />
i will back to oomkin soon though and i'll be looking for suitable +damage etc loot now in heroics like some boots from SP - blasphemy cloth ones ?  to boost my +damage which i think with a couple of pots got to about 760 yesterday.<br />
<br />
<br />
what sorta +damage / crit / spell hit / mana / hp  sholud i have before expecting to venture into heroics...say SP/Mech or Ramps.  Maybe Sethhek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-06-2008, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I levelled alot as boomking...wrath is better dps, starfire is better dpm.  For longer boss fights IS, SF x 3, repeat is your most efficient rotation, IS, MF, Wrath is your highest dps rotation but OOM for sure on bosses.<br />
<br />
Wear leather caster gear, seriously.  Mages can aoe crowd control, locks have pets, you have high armor.  Wear cloth armor and you give away your built in survivability.  Itemization in BC was horrible for Boomkings, but at level 70 there is enough available for you to run around in high quality leather caster gear.<br />
<br />
Intensity and Subtlety are must haves.  Boomking spell efficiency is pretty much teh suck, and they all seem to be high aggro spells so you must talent for those things.<br />
<br />
This is all pre patch, of course.<br />
<br />
My guild set 600 spell damage as the minimum for Kara runs, and that works pretty well as a minimum for heroic mgt, too.<br />
<br />
I'm going to do a few levels as Boomkin after the xpac comes out to check out the new tree.  I checked out my gear on the PTR, and my best weapon for magical damage is now Light's Justice...lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-07-2008, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cheers Oiy.<br />
<br />
i'll have to see what leather gear i can pick up early in Wrath.<br />
<br />
as i want to try out the new balance tree come the patch and then wrath being released.<br />
<br />
could not find any good balance craftable leather gear so ended up with the cloth items instead.<br />
<br />
think i ended up with 700 spell damage.</div></div><hr />
