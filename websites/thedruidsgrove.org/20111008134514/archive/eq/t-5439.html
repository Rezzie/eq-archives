<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noliniel</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guild had a thread going on about this topic, kinda interesting read. So I thought I might ask here for your best newbie memories ! Here is my. <br />
<br />
Well, my newbie experience is really wonderful; one that I won’t ever forget about it when thinking about EQ. Kane Bayle is my first server ever. I choose KB cause on the server select screen Kane Bayle was the first server on the population list. I thought cause Kane Bayle had the most people, so I choose it cause I really like servers with lot of people. =p  The truth is kinda exactly the opposite.  Anyways, I created a Wood elf Druid; I think I put most of my newbie points in int lol. I had totally no idea what I should do etc..<br />
<br />
 I had a different computer back then, one with some crappy Video card. Everything was pitch black, totally. After I created my character, I couldn’t see anything at all. I could see the chat windows and little bit of players. (Least I can tell if they moving or not =p)  I had no idea how to use tells, ooc, shout, auction and others back then lol. Only channel I know how to use is /say. So I would use /say to ask for help, or hailing players for no reason. =p  I think I even posted on EQ boards asking for help on the gamma problem. After spending a few hrs standing around I finally figured it out.  Ok hmm iirc I learned how to use /shout and asked around for help lol. Some stupid questions I asked was like how to get spells and where to get money. <br />
<br />
Back then, EQ was totally different. There were many new players and a lot of helpful ones. I got a few people willing to help me, one of them gave me 2 pp iirc. That was a lot for a newbie at that time. That player told me to get my spells using that 2 pp.  I had 0 idea on where the heck I am supposes to get my spells.  I had him showing me the way iirc.  Anyways he taught me how to use tells =p I was going to ask him where the mobs are but then I fell off the platform on Kelethin.  So I kinda found out where the mobs are =p<br />
<br />
I traveled around for a bit. Totally like lost. I got so lucky that time, no orc pawns or any kos mobs saw me =p Somehow I got to Felwithe without dying! I zoned in and /shouted around for help cause I was lost. (How silly I was!) Then a gnome poped out and saying he is willing to help! I had no idea what gnomes looks like back then =p  So I am like turning around and around looking for him. Lol I guess he figured out that I was a newbie and had no idea where he is. He told me to look down and I am like omg ! So short ! He helped me half way to Kelethin before I died and poped at my bindspot ! ( Lol my bindspot is right beside Kelethin and I had no idea!)  <br />
<br />
I played around for a few hrs and one of the spells require a fire beetle eye ! (How annoying was that ! No mobs in Greater Faydark like drop it ! ) I ooc’ed for help iirc and someone said it only drops in Freeport area. I had no idea where is that place so I asked around to see if anyone is willing to help me to get to Freeport! I got so lucky and a level 20 bard said he is willing to help me. So he picked me and a level 2 wizard up and zone’d into Butcherblock Mnts. I was like wow I never thought EQ is such a huge world. We took the 15 minutes boat to Freeport from Butcherblock !  After we arrived there then the  bard left us. A year and a bit after, I still wondering what his name is =p  Anywas, I got a beetle eye and some xp from the newbie zone. I got back to Kelethin somehow. Had some great times from then. Meet a lot of friends and had a ton of fun. From a raid attempt on Befallen to a successful 7 person raid on Emperor Crush when I was level 5. =p  Most of my friends from when I was a newbie quit though, kinda sad =/  Newbie time is something to be proud of in my EQ career I guess !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoak</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just the things that I still remember...<br />
<br />
<br />
* Wandering around and actually making it alive to right near HHK back when I was level 4.  Walking up to the three thieves near the town to hail them (thinking they were players) and not being alive anymore.  Lost my leet newbie gear and my oh so important Tome of Discord.<br />
<br />
* Thinking for the first few nights that if I killed too many goblins and orcs their people would, in fact, hunt me down.  I stopped killing them for a while.  Knew I could not survive the orc death squad that was surely on its way.<br />
<br />
* Making it through Kithicor (which I actually didn't realize was a dangerous thing to do) and seeing the planes of the commonlands for the first time.  Hard to imagine now but I was overwhelmed by the immersiveness and beauty of it...those really looked like lions!  Look at those spiders!  Look at that sky!<br />
<br />
* Running all the way to everfrost because I wanted to see if there was really snow like the map suggested.  Got there hmm around level 5 for the first time, but went back to Blackburrow to level up a bit before I spent any time (oh a lot of time) in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
* Having a high level player buff me and not knowing what they had done.  Worrying that I had been attacked (my only prior MMORPG experience was in UO so....).<br />
<br />
* Dieing horribly to Froon or Broon or some such and having them sit on my corpse.  Trusting a high level (level 12 omg!) enough to /consent them, back when consenting meant that you could loot anohter player's corpse.  Yep, my tattered leather was ubah.<br />
<br />
* Busting my halfling ass for faction so I could have faction with the Guardians of the Vale.  Thinking that surely being a Guardian of the Vale would add the title after my name (ie like a guildname).  And definitely wanting that uber rechargeable heal ring.<br />
<br />
Oooh hooo mem-or-ies...like the corners of my mind....<br />
<br />
Ty for the trip down that lane Noliniel.  Very timely for me to be reflecting since I am kind of on the point of quitting the game now, and it is nice to remember the innocence of Oldoak's youth ; ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aly</div><div class="date">10-27-2003, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well... I started way back in January of 2000 and began as a dark elf enchanter.  I got to level four before being frustrated by how long it took for mana to regen and the lack of spells.  So I deleted her and created a rogue.  I got to level fifteen that time and died deep in RunnyEye and hadn't really made any friends.  I couldn't get my corpse and it rotted. I started the rogue over again.  This was March 23rd of 2000.<br />
<br />
That's when I met a blacksmith.  Human paladin of Marr.  I was roleplaying and amazingly, he roleplayed as well.  It was the first time I'd seen real roleplaying in EQ.  So, my innocence was further kept pure.  I'd come into EQ thinking it was going to be just like the D&amp;D games I played.  I was quite naive.<br />
<br />
The paladin and I began to roleplay together a lot even though he was level thirty something and I was around six.  I got a new suit of banded mail armor that I wore most of until I was higher than fortieth level.  The day he gave me that set of armor, I felt so cool and stylish in a full set of chain armor. Hehe.<br />
<br />
Now I just feel foolish when I compare myself now to then... although I'm still in a set of chain graphics armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh!  Well, I had leveled my first character to the very high level of six or so.  My other RL friends were playing, they had all made gnomes, I had a high elf.  I decided I wanted them to come join me in Faydwer, so I met them in Ak'anon and tried to escort them to me.  <br />
<br />
It was like herding cats.  They sucked so badly at trying to find their way around or to even follow me.  It was long before /autofollow used to work very well.  It used to make you run in circles and was just horrible.  <br />
<br />
My friends got lost, they died.  When they finally got to Faydwer they wanted to go back &quot;home&quot; because they were unfamiliar with everything!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Racmoor</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a lot of good ones, but the best came when I got SOW.  My brother made a HE wizard and we decided that with sow we could now go see the world after I got a buffer into the level!  While we were seeing the world we would stop off in Qeynos and kill that dwarf for the bloodforge hammer.<br />
<br />
We found the boat and the trouble didn't start until Freeport.  Luckily we changed our bind spot the minute we got off the boat due to some advice from a higher level who chuckled after we told him what we were going to do.<br />
<br />
We wandered into the evil section in freeport.   Death 1.  Found the bank and attack the guard with the &quot;a&quot; key.  Death 2.  Didn't know much about the zones so we zoned into Northern Ro.  Paniced because we thought the &quot;evils&quot; controlled this area.  Wandered around FP some more then made it to EC.  Couldn't figure out what all the 'Spam' was for.  Zoning into WC we started to get nervous.  Together we're running along the path when BAM!  He's dead.  I thought he stepped on a trap or something...nothing was around us.  About that time a skeleton attacks me.  I panic and run around in circles with it beating on me.  Just as I remember I can outrun it, I slow wayyyyy down and a new icon is on my screen.  I look up and there is this mean ass plate armored DE bearing down on me with this huge pike.  He lays the smack down on me I zone back into WFP at the gate looking at my naked brother.  Death 3.<br />
<br />
He was there waiting for us when we tried to get our corpse.  Death 4<br />
<br />
He was waiting for us again when we tried to get our corpse.<br />
Death 5<br />
<br />
Who the $%^%$%^%$%^%$%^% is this guy and why won't he let me get all the tattered leather and silk armor I made for us!?  Death 6.<br />
<br />
We get our corpses finally and move on to Kithicor.  Look there is a nice bixie..that's cute.  ok, do we take a left or right here?  Hmmm...it just turned night.  Going to be a little harder to see I guess...WTF?!  Death 7<br />
<br />
That damn DE is back!!  $%^%$%^%$%^%$%^%!  Death 8<br />
<br />
Holy ****...not AGAIN!  Death 9<br />
<br />
About this time we decided to bind at the entrance of every new zone.<br />
<br />
Dude, I'm not going through this forest when it gets dark.  What kind of freaky **** comes out?!<br />
<br />
Ok, HHP!  &quot;Hey, you two want to join the group?&quot;<br />
<br />
/tell brother dude, we need xp, another death and I lose sow then we'll never get home.<br />
<br />
Ding 15.<br />
&quot;Damn, he was hiding in that tower! Unding 15 and Death 10.<br />
<br />
Look at all the animals....See the lions, they won't attack me though I'm a druid.  Death 11.<br />
<br />
Hello Mr Hill Giant!  Death 12.<br />
<br />
Bandits!!  run!!  Death 13.<br />
<br />
Holy ****!  Hill giant!  Wait, He's chasing that group.  Umm...no he isn't..he's killing **** for them!  WTF?  Dude, THEY'RE CHEATING!!<br />
<br />
Qeynos - /tell brother we just walk in, kick his ass, get his head and head home.  Hello Mr dwarf I need your head.....WTF?!  Why did the bouncer help!! Death 14.<br />
<br />
Let's try again..wait where is he going?  Follow him.  Dude!!  Now!! nobody's around!!  Yaaay!!<br />
<br />
/tell brother see that boat, I'm getting on it and riding it all the way back to Butcher I don't care how long it takes to zone, I'll never make it back otherwise.<br />
/Brother tells you Ok, I want to play around here for a few minutes, I'll catch up.<br />
<br />
zone 1, zone2, zone 3, zone 4  As I pull up to the dock, my brother is standing there....I stare at him and say WTF?!  I get off.  Guess this boat doesn't go back to butcher.<br />
<br />
/tell brother dude!  We're not going to make it.  We're going to die out there in those huge zones and we'll NEVER be able to found our corpses!  /cry /finger /rude.<br />
<br />
West commonlands - Almost home.  BAM!  Dead wizard...../cry Skellie on me!!  Death 15.<br />
<br />
/brother tells you I'm going to kill that son of a bitch someday.<br />
<br />
Khaladim - Bloodforge hammer /tell brother I'm NEVER EVER going to sell this thing!(We found out what the spam was in EC)<br />
<br />
Racmoor Kri'shandria<br />
<br />
P.S.   I sold it. :(  Needed money for my 19 spells. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jadegreif</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember just starting out as a ranger in Greater Faydark. Someone cast a buff on me.. ah.. shield icon, ok, got it.<br />
And I couldnt die, I kept on killing, and my red bar never went down. Wow, this is great.<br />
Eventually, the buff faded. I had no clue how to check out what kind of buff this was (must have been skin like nature or something like that)<br />
Some time later I get another buff, yay, that cute shield icon again, now I am invincible again. Well turns out, not all shield icon buffs are the same... hehe<br />
<br />
Nearly crying after I lost a tarnished rapier on a corpse near orc hill, just couldn't find it in time (30min corpse timer below lv5 back then).<br />
<br />
Standing at orc lift, I see this gnome in a distance, beeing chased by an orc. Pulling out my trusty bow I just bought for 2gp, I shot at the orc. Only to receive some mean tells about kill stealing, kiting. What the hell was he talking about ? I was just trying to help<br />
<br />
Speaking of that tells he sent. He had a pretty long name, and I kept typing /tell Soandso everytime I replied..... later I found out about the reply key.<br />
<br />
Never seen this blunder before., but I stayed in the newbie field a long time. Yay, those bats are finally green, and I can kill them easily now. Hmm... level 5 sure takes a long time.. wonder if thats one of those hell levels they kept talking about.<br />
Took me a while to notice the lack of 'you gain experience'. I was so busy looking at everything, keeping my eye on the fight and possible adds, that I didnt notice really I didnt gain exp off them anymore :P<br />
<br />
I would give a lot to get that intense feeling of innocent amazement back. Just beeing in the world... amazed at everything, not caring and knowing about stats, classes, nerfs, items. You know.... just beeing in a magnificent fantastic world.<br />
<br />
Even though I dont play EQ anymore, I truly thank the DEV's for letting me have that great innocent fun.<br />
I have played, and still playing, many other MMORGP, and though I am having fun, I never felt the feeling I had when I first stepped into the lands of Norrath.<br />

<br />
those orcs just along the hill from the merchants in lesser fay, see, they needed to die.  my friends gruffyd (ranger) and ghimkyllian (cleric) were just the folk to help make it happen.  the problem was our plans for splitting, peeling, or attacking never seemed to work... and ususally resulted in our own deaths.<br />
<br />
this time, the problem was, see, that big guy was mighty tough.  the other four or five in the camp were no problem whatsoever, solo.... so we scout the camp... we find we can pull an oracle out solo.  <br />
dead orc<br />
we find we can agro another through the tent, without actually seeing him.<br />
dead orc<br />
we scout some more... mind nobody has invis...  we try ranger sneak.<br />
dead ranger<br />
we try to pull the corpse...<br />
dead ranger<br />
we try to pull both corpses...<br />
dead cleric, but whew, got them both pulled back out of the camp.<br />
<br />
so we discuss at length, while getting our bodies back (this was long before any zone had a roaming cleric able to rez...)<br />
<br />
the plan was simple, we'd run though the camp (mind, nobody has sow), agro everyone to the merchants (and npc rangers nearby!), and gruffyd and ghim would peel the big guy off and work him over, while i helped (yeah, right) the npc's dispatch the rest of the pack.<br />
<br />
ok, we dispatch the oracle near the tree again, the other two move to the far side of the camp and wait in ambush... a war cry is called, and within 2-3 minutes of fighting, the whole camp was dead, but we.  yes, WE! had killed our prey.<br />
<br />
ah, the good old days....<br />
<br />

Faydwer is a continent, Madame(oiselle?) Pana :), and Ak'Anon is on Faydwer, so I think you mean the Faydark. Aye?</div></div><hr />

<br />
*snickers* Herding cats... you got the uber guild experience early on in the game... as for autofollow, I can get it to make me run around my target in circles all day long.  It's fun for irritating people that are trying to buff you after you send them a tell.<br />
<br />
Most people don't know about the /rtarget command.<br />
<br />
/me goes back to running in circles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent a lot of my EQ career herding cats.  One cat in particular, friend and old guild leader, Vert.  Someone Trevize knows...<br />
<br />
Anyway, Vert never did learn her way around EQ.  A very, very intelligent women in RL that could put us all to shame, I just couldn't teach her how to use /loc and figure out how to go from one location to another.   She'd get frustrated and just cajole someone to come get her and guide her to where she wanted to go. <br />
<br />
But one time, a group of us traveled from Freeport to Qeynos.  One person put another on follow, just outside of HHP in Eask Karana.  Those of you that didn't play that first year of EQ after it went live don't know the horror of /autofollow back then...   Anyway he starts the running in an enormous circle thing and runs off the edge of the cliff.  <br />
<br />
It took us hours and hours to locate his body!<br />
<br />
And then there was the time Vert drowned in the fountain in Unrest....   /sigh  Someone had to run all the way back to G. Fay to escort her back at least twice that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vila</div><div class="date">10-28-2003, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My two favorite memories come from my first character -- human warrior.  <br />
<br />
Started in Freeport and was amazed at the graphics and my inability to kill a rat...  RL friend of mine had a level 10 ranger and I watched him kill in a place called Crushbone... again, totally amazed.  Said if I came over to where he is, we could fight together.  After a long time of trying to figure out where the boat was I saw a /shout &quot;Boat!&quot;   Didn't make sense at first then *Bam* there was the boat in front of me ... wow, what a sight ! ... Got on the boat and thoroughly enjoyed the ride to Butcherblock.  I still enjoy watching Butherblock dock come in to focus after the trip...  I hop off the boat to see my friend waiting for me ... we run off the dock and I instantly get owned by the dorf guards... what the hell was that??!?  Apparently, religion counts... <br />
<br />
2nd favorite memory comes after I decided there was no way around getting killed by the dorf guards in Butcherblock, so I decide to go it alone in East Commonlands.  I'm beating an orc pawn to death when a real high level person wanders up (can't remember name or class) and says to me &quot;You might want to kill this next orc pawn, I think he has something good on him&quot;  Not knowing what to do I say ok.  Sure enough there is an orc pawn, I engage it and it dies.  I go to loot the corpse and to my surprise it has a Banded Mail tunic on it... wow !!   I turn to say something to the high level person but he was gone.  Didn't catch the name so couldn't send him a tell.  That noob experience was what made this game so much fun for me...<br />
<br />
Also, /shouts of &quot;Griffon!&quot; and watching people scatter were classic ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">10-29-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Friends bought me the game for my birthday and I started a half-elf bard out of Qeynos.<br />
<br />
I remember one of those friends showed up in Qeynos, and we ran thru Karanas, HH, Kith, WC (there were SO many people just sitting at the rings!), EC (omg the tunnel, where was I being taken??), and NRo (wow, what were all these monsters in the desert?  what would I do if one came at me??) to EFP!  It was wild and scary and oh so exciting!<br />
<br />
Another great memory, same character (now semi-retired) got married.  We held the ceremony in the Temple of Ro.  When I arrived at zone, there was a pink section of floor at the zone in (a welcome mat? or a glitch?).<br />
<br />
We said our own vows, and our guild leader, a paladin, led the ceremony, as no GMs got back to us.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the ceremony, I turned around to see not one, but THREE GMs!  They handed out cake and champagne, and one even followed us to the Arena for the Reception Rumble...his name was Leosaur, iksar monk, if I recall.<br />
<br />
That was an awesome nite, and I still have the log from it somewhere.  Wish the GMs had the time and freedom to get that involved again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celaeno</div><div class="date">10-30-2003, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First incarnation of Celaeno lasted just long enough to be killed by an orc pawn. I wasn't used to games that couldn't be paused, so I paniced and didn't even know where I died. I didn't want to lose my newbie tunic, so I rerolled her :)<br />
At level 3 or so, I struck gold: some incredibly high level guy was trading patchwork armor for batwings! I leveled to 5 killing bats, and got a full set for my trouble :)<br />
At level 10, I left Gfay for the first time :) After spending enough time in Crushbone to decide I didn't care for it, I ran to the boat to Freeport, using the cloth map that came with Kunark to figure out where to go.<br />
At level 15, I was killed by a ghoul, swore I'd get a runed totem staff, mentioned saving up for it in a group only to have one of the others take me to the bank and hand me one for free :) It was around this time that I was completely in awe of a friend of mine, who was a whopping level 26 and exping in Cazic Thule!</div></div><hr />
