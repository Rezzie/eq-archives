<br />

<br />
that other account was the free (through velious) account they emailed around shortly after luclin came out, and i spent money to upgrade it to SoL and PoP, but never bought LoY or LDoN for it.</div></div><hr />

We've been playing over 4 years, and at one point we each moved our 2nd mains to new accounts.  One was originally a mule account, the other a cheap trilogy.  Since then we picked up a 5th account when a friend left the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to pay for two (both my own).<br />
<br />
I canceled one, and then the other.<br />
<br />
The second is still payed atm, but I am not paying.<br />
<br />
So...put me in the &quot;other&quot; category.<br />
<br />
I didn't give any of my accounts away, but I am not paying.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;i gave away my account&quot; option is just extra info.  I guess you could assume that someone else who hasn't voted would be in the 1+ category.</div></div><hr />
