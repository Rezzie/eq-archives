I can't find anything though that says yes/no on this.  Has anyone else heard a similar rumor floating around?</div></div><hr />

There aren't a whole lot of items that are *clear* upgrades for me with the Emblems of Triumph. Heck, I may end up spending them all on PvP gear = \</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-18-2009, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">same Skw, i currently have about 110 of them and i still cant decide wot to buy hence i have that many given that they have ALL come from daily heroics only.....<br />
<br />
with 3 possible specs i just dunno wot to get....sure the 245 level stuff is nice but i'd need a lot more to make a dent in gear upgrades for my main spec.  and not convinced to buy 245 level stuff for either resto or feral.<br />
<br />
i guess if this patch is soon and i am swimming in them i can then buy a load of the 245 items in reasonable time.....</div></div><hr />
