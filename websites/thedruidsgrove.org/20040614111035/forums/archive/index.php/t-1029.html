<br />
I'm compiling a list of the merchant LDON lists.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know so is everyone else.  So what's the big deal? Well, I got irked by the fact that you can't search or filter any of the other lists, so I'm working on a script that will allow you to do that.  The search isn't active yet, but if you want to see work in progress, or just a list of items, check out:<br />

&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Eventually, I hope to be able to filter by dungeon, price, stats, classes etc.  Hopefully it will all get done in the next day or two, depending on how much free time I get.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>random user</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Filters for class and dungeon added.<br />
<br />
Filters for min/max points, augmentations are coming next.  Filters for effects may take a bit but I'll try and get those done.<br />
<br />
What I really need now is for people to help me flush out the list.  <br />
<br />
If you find yourself at an adventure merchant and see something that's not on the list (or if you are lazy, if you see stuff worth 500 points or more) please either note it here or send a cross-server tell to: eci.xylem<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for any help, and as always please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darlyn Freeheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, so far this looks amazing!! Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gimli fan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are able please add and AP matrix to your sight that shows how many AP's a person of a particular level will get for normal or hard.<br />
<br />
It would be a great piece of info associated with your sight.<br />
<br />
Perhaps even a calculator so people can see how much time/success it will take to buy Butter muffin +1, etc. Though I am sure people can do the math it would be no problem for your code to do it.<br />
<br />
I am starting a thread about it and hope to post the matrix when someone with access to all the data puts it out for the public. No dobut you can get the info that way as well.<br />
<br />
Nice tool btw, good show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>random user</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks, added the Ruj items.<br />
<br />
I'll see what I can do about putting up something with the matrix at least.  I'll have to think about the UI a bit to see if I can fit in how many adventures required without making it too crowded, I'm not super happy with the layout atm anyways (mostly in terms of some things taking up too much space, like that all minus charm slots) so I'll see what I can do, once I finish implementing more of the features I think are pretty core.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>borreny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is great so far!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karanthal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great list.  Its a shame you used port 8080 for the site though, Id guess a few people cant view it from work.  I had to alter my firewall config while looking at it.<br />
<br />
Also wanted to bump up this post, took me a while to find it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>random user</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually I think port 80 works now too...<br />
<br />
There was a firewall problem at one point in time, but it's too late to ask everyone to change their links, rebookmark etc<br />
