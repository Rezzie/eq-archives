<br />
I was hoping i could get some advise for my feral druid<br />
<br />
I have been pvping lately to get some purple gear (can't make it for the usual raid times) This is my current profile:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Blackhand&amp;n=Garionn<br />
<br />
I've already gotten the Merciless Gladiator's Dragonhide Helm as well.<br />
<br />
I find that I die too easily while pvping, rogues I hit are constantly dodging my blows and I dont seem to hit hard enough. Druids are supposed to be pretty resilient right? <br />
<br />
1) What stats should I improve and to how much? <br />
<br />
2) What gear should I work towards to in order to join raids in future?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

i'm not much of a pvper so cannot really comment other than i find rogues a pain if i come across one 1 on 1.  they do seem to have such a high dodge chance so i guess you need as much +hit as possible ? although i've not found much +hit gear and tbh i think you simply want to aim for as much stam as you can to survive longer against them and then stack some agi/str/ap.<br />
<br />
<br />
having said that its all going to change in 6 weeks when Wrath comes out and any gear you go for now will probably soon be outdated as you level ?<br />
<br />
otherwise some current good tanking gear includes :<br />
<br />
Tree Mender's Belt - heroic Ramparts<br />
Badge of Tenacity - from the AH !<br />
Bands of the Swift Paw - badges of justice<br />
Idol of Terror - badges of justice<br />
Belt of Natural Power - crafted<br />
<br />
plus lots more nice items from Badges of Justice assuming you are running heroics.<br />
<br />
stats for raiding / heroics - always make sure you are uncritable - easy if you are using some pvp gear with +res although this i believe is going to change come Wrath ?  Then aim for high armour and stam. then stack some Agi/+hit.<br />
<br />
The links above should show you what to aim for...<br />

i've not bothered with much hit. only bother with hit if its on items that have other stats i want.<br />

Does anyone have any recommendations on gems if the epic gems aren't readily available?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi Dest, I would wait till the expansion, as the new green gems are almost identical to epics being cut currently.  I am a JC and have watched the price of epics plummet as the new expansion draws closer, stones that used to go for 300g are now selling for 120-150.  <br />
<br />
Oh well, still some money to be made buying uncuts for 80g and listing for 150 :)  :deadhorse</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Not sure about wotlk, values haven't been finalized yet, and no one is really sure how Druids will tank.  At 70 in bc, quite a few endgame druids just stacked +10agi gems all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like a safe bet considering our physical damage mit is going down, along with our armor and multiplier in Dire Bear.  Less Armor + a ridiculous amount of stam could maybe balance it out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind Dest that yes we were nerfed, but only to bring us in line with other tanks' mitigation, not to make us worse than them.  If we are in fact proven to mitigate worse than the other classes, it will be by a tiny amount.  Blizzard will fix any major discrepancy.<br />
<br />
In TBC pre-Sunwell you wanted to aim for being uncrittable, and have 40% dodge and 20k health unbuffed.  After that you had some flexibility based on your preference and situation to stack more stam, more hit for better threat, strength for ap...whatever you wanted.  You won't be able to get 40% dodge unbuffed until several levels beyond 70 anymore, but 20k health is totally achievable.<br />
<br />
Baselines for LK have not been established yet, but the safe bet is to stack armor like crazy, once you are comfortable with your level of health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-10-2008, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've heard bear tanks at 80 should have about 32k health going into Naxx, but that might be raid buffed.  The other tanks were hovering around 30k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-10-2008, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, our stam multiplier is still intact as far as I know.  I haven't heard any grumbling regarding that yet.  Stam is a pretty good stat for druids to stack, because the gems seem to be heavy on th stat (+8 agi or +12 stam) and we get an extra 25% Health in bear form.  So your 12 stam is worth ~150 hit points!</div></div><hr />
