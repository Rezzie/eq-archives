Try it sometimes guys, solo of course. I reccomend Mammoths in IFG, dark blue ones. Can clear out the entire camp in 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, Entrap now frees up the spell slot you may have used for some other snare spell.  I don't understand how the need to cast a spell snare (pre-entrap) made charming an impossibility, or impratical, or pointless, or however you may classify it.<br />
<br />
I have effectively used charm techniques to max out AA's, and have been using charm in varying degrees as a primary form of AAXP since the PoP era and level 63's Command of Tunare (much &lt;3).<br />
<br />
Entrap just allows me to juggle spell slots differently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaiffanFV</div><div class="date">11-24-2007, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please correct me if I'm wrong - but a while back xp using a charmed mob was supposedly decreased significantly, depending on how much dmg the charmed mob did to the defeated NPC.  Is this still active/correct?  If so, how much less solo xp do you get?  <br />
<br />
Also, charmed NPCs (past OoW zones IIRC) do much less dmg than non-charmed ones.  Does this make it difficult to keep charmed pets alive?  <br />
<br />
The last 1-2 years I'd only been charming in groups since it reduces the amount of total dmg vs. PC damage done by the charmed pet (point 1) and is much easier to have a tank on a mob and pet as DPS if pet does less dmg than the mob.  <br />
<br />
I'll have to go and try out mammoths in ICF to see if its better to solo charm then in the past - but any of you charmers out there have any comments to my concerns above?  <br />
<br />

Thanks !</div></div><hr />

Rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />
