<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">05-15-2008, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, so I'm feral... but i have a pretty sweet healing set... the only green is my boots... trinkets, idol, and back are blues, one-handed is blue a mace from MagT (with a gem slot), and the rest are Kara drops... bonus healing atm is about 1077, but i digress (as usual)<br />
<br />
I was playing around with my healer gear, and noticed that my lifebloom is ticking away at 300-something, and final heal is like914... but it's not stacking! whether i pop it once, or try to stack it, im still getting the same numbers... i notice that when i have my arena set on, it ticks for 100-something and final heal is 600, but that i can stack and it's STILL not as good as ONE lifebloom with my healer set on (even though it doesn't stack) i should have paid more attention to my idol at the time, as that MAY be the answer... but i was wondering how +healing bonuses affect lifebloom, and why the hell it's not stacking for me...<br />
<br />
2nd question: with 1,077 +healing, do you think i could mH reg level 70 instances?</div></div><hr />

Especially on longer boss fights.<br />

The LB issue is weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">05-15-2008, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your Lifebloom issue is really, really weird.  If what you're saying is true, it sounds like you're getting two stacks no matter what in your healing gear (if it's healing for 300-something per tick at your bonus healing level), whereas your Lifeblooms are stacking properly in your PVP gear.  Your idol is certainly not going to dictate whether or not Lifebloom stacks.  If this problem persists I'd contact a GM.<br />
<br />
As for coefficient information, this is quoted from http://druid.wikispaces.com/Druid_Game_Mechanics:<br />
<br />
Lifebloom:<br />
<br />
- Approximately 51.8% of your +healing is added the the HoT over all 7 ticks (7.4% per tick); <br />
- Approximately 42.8% of your +healing is added the end heal; <br />
- The +healing bonus of Lifebloom is, as of patch 2.1, added to all 3 stacks of Lifebloom, so stacking lifebloom 3 times will add a total of 155.4% of your +healing to the HoT (22.2% per tick). <br />
- The end heal of lifebloom is unaffected by the amount of stacks of Lifebloom. It will always heal for 600 + 42.8% of your +healing regardless of 1, 2 or 3 stacks. <br />
- The end bomb of lifebloom doesn't count as your own healing. Therefore, all agro generated by the end bomb of lifebloom is attributed to the person healed, not to yourself.</div></div><hr />

okay, that imformation definitely helps a little bit, thank you!<br />
<br />
now, as far as those mechanics go, is that with any points in improved LB or anything (is there even such a talent? i've never really even looked that hard down the resto tree)<br />
<br />
as far as contacting a GM goes, i think i know the anwer: &quot;please delete all files from your addons folder and your WTF folder&quot; (ie youtube's World of Warcraft Jimmy story) lol</div></div><hr />

There aren't any talents that affect Lifebloom only, however, Lifebloom will get an extra 30% of your bonus healing if you go deep enough in the resto tree to get the 10% extra bonus healing to all heals and then the 20% extra bonus healing to HoTs talents.  I don't remember the names of the talents ... but there is probably an explanation on that game mechanics page.</div></div><hr />
