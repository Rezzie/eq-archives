The expansion goes live in a little over 2 weeks, yet nothing.  How are we to test these new AA's for bugs and problems if they are not given to us on beta??<br />
<br />
Im going to assume that most of you are going to say that SOE does not want us to leak the new AA's.   Without breaking the NDA.. This expansion is going to change the game as we know it.. forever.. <br />
<br />
Now, if i can make such a claim from what is open to everyone in beta testing, why cant i beta test something as common as AA abilties?   Unless these abilities are just crazy..<br />
<br />
Why do i have a feeling when one of us buys a new AA ability and use it, its going to crash the server..... cuzz the idiots didnt let us test it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The website says there will be, but i have yet to see any in Beta or on Lucy.. so they are keeping real tight lipped about the AA's and Spells.</div></div><hr />

We are getting a little to close to that grey area bordering the Non Disclosure Agreement the beta testers made with Sony. Crossing over that line would be a no-no on the Grove.</div></div><hr />

B: To even mention that you're in the &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; beta is a violation of the NDA.<br />
C: We're pretty big sticklers here at TDG about sticking to the NDA.  In fact, we even have an entire section in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=2048&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; that's devoted to it.<br />
D: I'm closing this thread because I'm an evil person.</div></div><hr />
