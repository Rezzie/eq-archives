To be honest I didn't know and feel kinda stupid for even trying to finish this strand.  Any word on when Blizzard will fix this?  From what I read the quest was bugged beyond completion when they put in the honor system.  The books are friggin floating above and are unreachable as far as I can tell.  Anyone else recently complete this quest with any luck?  <br />
<br />
The reason I am asking is because this quest eventually finishes with you defending Darrowshire from undead attacks, and freeing Joseph Redpath from being evil or whatever (the ghost).  One of the rewards from this final quest is the Ring of Protection which gives some around 100+ AC.  I NEED that for my build to get insanse Feral AC in Dire Bear for PvP.</div></div><hr />
