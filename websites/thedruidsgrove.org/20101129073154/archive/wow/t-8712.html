Instead of getting an epic mount, I think it would be perfect if druids had an equally painful quest to get their epic travel form, the crow.<br />
<br />
The crow form would work just like the current epic mounts, and would 'fly' just like many of the birds we encounter in game; just a few feet off the ground.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

Make a suggestion on the official WoW boards for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, the paladin/warlock epic mounts are an INFERIOR version of something available to every class.  A new improved travel type form ISNT available to every class.<br />
<br />
((They are inferior, because unlike other epic mounts they take mana to cast.   So you can't mount silenced/low on mana))<br />
<br />
Second, other classes got epic quests for items.   I am not sure Druids are included or not as mine isnt that high.   But you'd have to likely give that up.</div></div><hr />

Well druids need mana in order to shapeshift too, don't they?<br />
I guess the best choise will be a raven fo NE (druid of the talon...) and some kind of eagle for the Taurens...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think it would be no higher than the other birds in the game. We wouldn't be able to fly above anyone, or do up/down motion and we would be accessible to be hit by any ground based PC/NPC. <br />
<br />
However, just thinking about it, this would have to come with a permanent feather-fall because how lame would it be to have a flying form and die from dropping off a cliff?</div></div><hr />

A SS to druid of the fang (snake) form would be awesome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
you would infact be giving NOTHING up since there is no epic quest for this class</div></div><hr />

In WCIII Druids of the Talon got a CROW form so i think it would fit more into the storyline since WoW is mainly about storyline not just questing and raiding and getting to lvl60 :D. So yea i think crow would fit more.</div></div><hr />
