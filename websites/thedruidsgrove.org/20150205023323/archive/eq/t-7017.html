Where is a good place for a 34 druid to start quading and soloing?<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Then I moved to the ones behind the Tower of Frozen Shadows. There are snow dervishes there too but sometimes they gate back to the tower when low on health.  This was before they nerfed KEI however, I'm unsure if you'll be able to it without KEI.<br />
 <br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

I did this before KEI was available, so with todays mudflation, I know its doable.  The zone is awesome for kiting druids as you can wolf form, sell to the vendor at the aviaks, hurt no factions, have zone out nearby, can bind there, and only have to worry about the cyclops, and undead cyclops mobs.  You can also go up in the aviak tower and be completely aggro free for hours while medding.<br />
<br />
Shortly after you outgrow aviaks, you can move up to the gnolls outside splitpaw.  (If not before.</div></div><hr />

Who needs it (can't get it anyway)? As far as quadding, there are several posts here, but to put in my two cp worth, the first question I guess would be how much wisdom/mana you have? If you don’t have at least good wisdom, I’m guessing around 180 or more then I might be concerned with running out of mana before the quad is successfully finished. And how good your gear is is also a good question, but at level 32, you should have enough stats/gear to be successful. Get your Solstice Earring (FT1) as that will help.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
I started quadding in Iceclad by the igloos (just northwest of the dock). You can run cougars back and forth just south of the igloos for 3 or 4 levels at least. They resist snare occasionally and also will draw an add if not careful, but good EXP. No real loot except the cougar claw earring (Mama Pres I), which sells for 100-200pp in the bazaar. After that I moved to the big Island in Iceclad where I did wolves and Giants (you’d better have LOT’S of mana for Giants,). Giants can also be root/rotted there as well for soloing. Giants have good loot and occasionally some drops for the Prayer Shawl quests if you’re interested.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
If you’re not sure, try Gnolls in SK first. They are real easy, drop some loot and weapons and are just plane fun to learn to quad. Aviaks as well in SK for quadding.&lt;BR&gt;<br />
After that try EW…lot’s of solo and quad mobs there (be careful of the Mystic of Ry’Gor if quadding them, he’s a caster and rooted me yesterday with 3 mobs in my pull…VERY UGLY. He hangs out in a hut just off the bridge in EW). Anyway, good luck.</div></div><hr />

There is an area just east of the tents by the Rockhopper caves that you can use for your 'runway' and you won't get any adds.  Not too many people know about it, or use it; at least they didn't back then.<br />

I did rhinos at around 34-39 then sarnaks when they started turning light blue. After that was TD spirocs till 52 then i went to the raptor island in TD. Then velious came out and i found the Wyverns are way better exp and PP and if you die its easier to get a rez. Just watch out for the drakes. If you pull a wyvern to close to the wandering drakes it will agro.<br />
<br />
 After that i started doing otters otters are awesome xp i did them until 60 i think. After that i would just get a group in POP the xp was about the same as quading since they changed the way xp works.<br />
<br />
Note i havent quaded for awhile this is more of an old school way hopefully this still works well.</div></div><hr />

They are easy and drop the best loot. All these other places are not as good if you want loot too. And the XP is awesome, especially at 36, and right up to 40. I'm talking about 2.5 blue per quad.<br />
<br />
Oh, at 34 I was soloing Hill Giants, then I went to the spctres at 36, never regretted it.</div></div><hr />

I got a lvl every night there till 34 when i went to OT but i also got about a lvl a night. Although you should remember i wouldnt be as good of a druid as i am without grouping. So just solo while looking for a group or if you dont have much time to play. I would never have to look for a group for long because everyone knew how good i was. whether it be healing, back up healing, or ghetto mezzing.</div></div><hr />

I wore Ulthork arms for a long time.  The Nothern Ulthorks will take you to your low 40's.  The southern ulthorks are a bit higher and can take you up through the low 50's if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />
