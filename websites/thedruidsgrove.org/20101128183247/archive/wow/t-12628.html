I was wondering if it's possible for us to do that in Heroic instances? Has anyone tried this?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is we're a smallish guild and I'd like to get some of our members working together and getting badges would help too. Better than a PUG and makes Heroics easier if we don't have  great gear.</div></div><hr />

You can do that in all of the old world ones. It sucks when you have 6 or 7 friends/guildies online and everyone wants to run an instance together.</div></div><hr />
