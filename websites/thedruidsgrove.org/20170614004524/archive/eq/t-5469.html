random stuff sees invis on the way there but low reaction time, with sow you can for the most part run through, otherwise you turn to some judicious use of root/snare and camp<br />
<br />
and yes, there are 5 mobs in the camp, none of them have more than 11kp or hit for over 150 and they do not all aggro at once, 2 at a time and the one in the corner single to break the camp, easily doable with decent bazaar bought gear and kei =)<br />
<br />
on a side note - prolly 6-7 hours spent here, 5 Kuxiux and 5 cloaks thus far, from all the posts Ive read it does still drop though, just kinda rare =)</div></div><hr />

They are made by your local GM Tinkerer, and can be recharged with a mana battery class 6 in a toolbox by anyone.<br />

Will get kei, and go back in tonight -- working one's way through by waiting for the see invis mobs to cast and running by can be tiring, hehe.<br />

I was very unlucky, getting no rares in 3 hours of work, without kei. Ended up rooting and burning with Starfire, for the best mana/damage ratio.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've carried a minimizing device, a stack of mana batteries and a collapsible tool kit with me since we raided Bertoxx in CoD.  Shrink is pretty handy to have when you are raiding in tight quarters or raiding on a mount.  When we are raiding where mounts can be summoned, people on mounts are &quot;requested&quot; to shrink.  Pretty tough to target around in a 72 person raid with half of them on mounts.</div></div><hr />

I went to get this wand the last weekend.  A level 65 druid can get back there solo and kill the PHer without much in the way of problems.  You can kill the few see invis mobs as you go, or just time your run past them.<br />
<br />
You may run into various casters in the area who debuff you, so don't depend on KEI staying up long.  Moreover, the drop rate is not nearly as good as you might think.   It took me three days, but I ended up with 10 cloaks before getting the Wand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the bid room with the cavern and bridge, if the bridge is straight ahead of you, there should be a path off to the left. Follow path until you see a big collumn, spire, whatever you want to call it to your right. It is slighty tilted so jump off the path onto it. Now, look towards the path and slighy walk forward until you start falling, after a bit you will fall down a ways and land and a platform that is like 1/2 to the bottom of the cavern. At most you should take 600 dmg. Simpy jump off that and take a little more damage, and you are at the bottom, safe and sound  :).<br />

I have a 65 Pally I'm bringing with me (pacify), but I'd like to know so we can both try soloing it when we're not online together.</div></div><hr />

This works MOST of the time that I could see.. have egress up and be ready to use it.. it will probably take you a few tries and some luck.  What sucks is that some of the mobs in the camp dispell so they got my C first and I had a hard time holding down the camp solo.  Good Luck. :)</div></div><hr />

It should, but then, druids can't cast pacify.</div></div><hr />

**edit** 7 cloaks 0 wands<br />

Easy camp for non uber level 65 druid. Even after kei is dispelled if you just kill the 4 mobs in the cave. I found that on the break in of the 3 at the end you can cast root on the far right one and only the center one will come. Kill it then the the rooted one. This leaves the left one where Kox spawns for last which is perfect since you wont have to worry about adds when you fight Kox. This even worked when Kox was up when I got there. <br />
<br />
I usually just kill the see invis mobs on my way there. Most the time you only have to fight one add and I've been able to just root rot them. And with the in game map system you can easily cross the invis bridge now. Just zoom in and there is a nice fat path to follow. Or use the piller method but it's not needed anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I camped here for 4 days... there was 4 mobs here for those 4 days. 1 in the middle of the hall and 3 at the end. Had Kox spawn several times but no wand. <br />
<br />
So last night I get there and there are 3 mobs in the middle and 5 at the end!!! Twice as many!!! So all I could handle were the 5 at the end. Just barley, would slowly have less and less many as the repoped. And after 3-4 kills of whole camp I was usually to low to stick around and usually lost my kei by then. Funny how they always get kei, pot9 and regen every time no matter what buff slot i moved them to. <br />
<br />
So is the normal camp or was it changed in the patch?</div></div><hr />

Eventually, a Necro joined me and it made things so much easier. Later, Monk and Sham friends joined us (for shards) and it was silly easy.  We all got shards and had too many to count rot.  Saw more cloaks than I care to mention, and Zero Wands.  That tiny little guy is starting to annoy me.</div></div><hr />

Pretend that you're going to log (I.E. - Hey guys, I'm tired of camping this, I'm going to head on out.), then after you log out come back in like 8 mins...POOF! Kioux is up and he'll drop the wand.  This is how these kind of camps work. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol. I'm gonna try that.<br />
<br />
But I HAVE to say that there is NO WAY that dispell is random. Only ONCE in over a week here has the dispelling mob MISSED my kei. I've hid it in just about every buff slot. I even made sure I had 15 buffs. It don't matter if kei is 1st, last or anywhere in the middle. And I'm talking about over 20 times this has happened.  :curse:</div></div><hr />

This thread (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12966) at Alla's was the one I found.  Most useful was this post:<br />
<br />
Koxiux (or his placeholder) spawns at -279, 2366.  He's near a big rock at the end of a tunnel, with four other mobs around him. With pacification you can pull him without the others.<br />
<br />
I managed to do it solo as an enchanter (without using charm), but it's much easier with a partner. A 65 necro could solo too... it'd be kinda tough to break the camp but once you did, no problem.<br />
<br />
You might want to add these lines to the TheDeep_2.txt file in your Maps directory:<br />
<br />
P -2091, 207, -77, 0, 127, 0, 2, pull_to_here<br />
P -2366, 279, -65, 0, 127, 0, 3, Koxiux_the_Imperceptible<br />
<br />
One warning: In the southwest of this zone, near the THO, there are Elder Thought Horrors. You really really don't want to fight those -- find some other route to get to Koxiux.<br />
 <br />
-- Sylphan, master Enchanter of Knights of the Round Table on Cazic-Thule<br />
If you mod your mapfile with those lines, finding him couldn't be easier.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I could get a minimizing device, but I'm far too lazy to get batteries and recharge it ;) I'm not a huge druid (obviously not an ogre or a troll or something), but I too would like the ability to shrink while on a mount. <br />
<br />
I took my warrior friend with me the other day and we had no luck after a few hours. I went there by myself yesterday, and after finally making it there (had to kill a couple see invis mobs on the way, but they were alone so I didn't have adds), I ended up leaving after about the fifth mob. Somewhere in there my KEI got dispelled, and I was in a bad position when the respawn started happening. I think I will try again today and not give up all hope when (not if) my KEI gets dispelled. Maybe I can convince a chanter friend of mine to come along...<br />
<br />
Wish me luck, I'll respond with my progress, hopefully. =)</div></div><hr />

Most of the mobs in the tunnel could not be mezzed. I also found out that my mana pool isn't quite large enough to solo my way in. I kept having respawn to deal with while I was medding from one of the 2-at-a-time pulls.<br />
<br />
That was very disheartening, but later we brought back my friend's necro, who proceeded to own the place :) We stayed about 2.5 hours (though it seemed like longer) and I didn't get my wand. No, I'm not talking about &quot;only cloaks dropped,&quot; the named never even spawned for us.  :bs: Ah well. Another day, I suppose.  :(</div></div><hr />

Took my warrior friend and went there for a couple hours before an otm. Only we weren't there very long....killed Xiox in the next cave over, then came to camp Koxiux. Killed the PH that was up, and another one....third one spawned the little guy! That was my first sighting of him and he dropped the wand...I feel like one lucky druid  :elfgrin:</div></div><hr />
