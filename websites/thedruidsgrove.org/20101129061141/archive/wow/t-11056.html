Whats your strategy in there? Sometimes I play offensive and change to the cheetah/cougar grab the flag and run back. <br />
<br />
Other times I play defense by hiding and when I see someone with the Alliance flag running back I root the Alliance thats chasing him/her, moonfire a few times and run back with him. How do you all play in there?</div></div><hr />

I end up in cross-server PuGs, which are worse than regular Pugs and not nearly as polite, so I am not in an organized group.<br />
<br />
I usually start off by cheetah form all the way to their base, and then stealth to where their flag was (some other player with an epic mount is now running it to our base), as soon as he gets hammered for trying to go solo and the flag gets returned, I jet off with it.<br />
<br />
If I am lucky a few quick shifts anda free action pot will get me back to my base.  If the opponents are organized well and stomp on me, I spend the rest of the time near the exit to our tunnel rooting their runners and chasers and healing ours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the weirder phenomon I've encountered is how easy it is for me to sit and drink in the opposing teams Flag Room while people are fighiting to get the flag back... I guess it's cause people are too busy fighting to protect the flag carrier and they think &quot;you can't kill the flag carrier with heals&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another useful thing is with stealth and track you can pin down flag carriers.  I'd suggest &quot;/tar carrier-name&quot; aswell, it helps finding those annoying hiding spots. <br />
<br />
I judge my performance of HK's not KB's.  I think the ultmiate druid score is always 0/0/&quot;whole lot of HK's&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">09-12-2006, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moonfire can rack up the HK's in any BG, however WSG is not about kills anyway.  It's about snare and go cap, rinse repeat. The team should be assisting to kill or snare a supporting healer perhaps.  Other than that your just keeping the other team away from your carrier.  Kill em and they just respawn with full mana and return to the fight while your mana and health are still suffering from the long fight.  If you want to rack up a lot tof HK's or KB's spend time in AB or AV.   Druids rarely get high numbers of KB's because they lack a high damage instant cast.<br />
<br />
Warriors execute<br />
Shaman shock<br />
Mages fire blast or cone of cold<br />
Warlocks shadowburn<br />
Hunters multishot<br />
<br />
But the moonfire is not enough dmg usually to get the killing blow if your fighting in groups.  So I would definately just work on maximizing your HK's.</div></div><hr />

I was getting owned beyond belief yesterday. How can a Alliance on foot catch me when Im in the cheetah type form? His spell range was crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarconious</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do they determine that battlegound? By level? If so then my God atleast be 3-5 levels higher than me or others and not 9. I played last night and was only level 40 in their, others where 47-49. I need to just level up more and come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Battlegrounds are broken up by &quot;brackets&quot;:<br />
10-19<br />
20-29<br />
30-39<br />
40-49<br />
50-59<br />
60<br />
<br />
You can occassionally get a 20/30/40/50/60 in your group if they level up after they queued up, but this shouldn't happen so much anymore with the crossrealm battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Going against someone 7-9 lvls higher is just asking for a beating.  I always suggest you enter battlegrounds towards the latter 3 levels of your bracket, just so you can be more competitive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sugar</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, now with the x-realms BGs im thinking they should make the level range be 5 lvls instead of 10.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is it any different than it was before X-realms?  If you step in at the lower end of the bracket you'll get WTFBBQPWND, you come in at the higher end and you have a shot to live ( for a bit ).<br />
<br />
Even if you break it down by ranges of 5, you'll have people waiting at lvl 34 to go in and beat on lvl 30s.  You'll still have a disparity and it may be harder to get queues at that small a bracket.  <br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sugar</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats a whole lot less disparity to worry about if u ask me!!  if i'm 22, i'd much rather face a 24 twink than a 29 twink!<br />
<br />
my point was pre x-realms it would have taken forever to get in a game if they made the brackets any smaller.  that never seems to be a problem now.<br />
<br />
perhaps most importantly, i think that psychologically it would help to curb people who make BG twinks.  it seems overall 'less worth it' if you can gank a smaller subset of the general population.   if i'm 29, i can gank people from 20-28, whereas if the bracket is smaller i can only gank 25-28, who are actually a lot harder to truely 'gank' than the 20-24 peeps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Twinks are all about getting the highest lvl blues &amp; purples they can and getting all their gear enchanted.  <br />
<br />
Going in as a 22 and having a 24 in all blues with crusader, life stealing, +100 hp to chest, +9 str to bracers, etc etc etc they will still gank you faster than you can say &quot;oh sh..&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarconious</div><div class="date">09-14-2006, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing I noticed or trying to figure out is a certain spell that resist nature damage. I must of tried to root this dwarf like 5 times and kept getting RESIST. <br />
<br />
He was chasing the flag runner so I thought a root will slow him down but nope, 5 times nothing.</div></div><hr />

At least one should have stuck though.  Maybe you just got unlucky.</div></div><hr />
