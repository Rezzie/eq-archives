Am I limited to only 2 other zones for level 18 to 25 hunting? Whats the places you enjoyed the best at 18 to 25?</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure but what about Redridge...it's close isnt it? or Duskwood?<br />
<br />
Heck I havent a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends. You could try Redridge first, and then hit Duskwood once you're into level 20. Ashenvale works around the lower 20s until about level 30. Wetlands could work as well, but that's level 20ish as well. I'd say Redridge and then Duskwood or Wetlands or Ashenvale. You might be better off with Duskwood after Redridge.<br />
<br />
Generally, it'll go like this, I think (I haven't actually played a gnome or dwarf yet):<br />
Humans: Elwynn, Westfall, Redridge, Duskwood<br />
Night Elves: Teldrassil, Darkshore, Ashenvale<br />
Dwarves/Gnomes: Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, Wetlands<br />
<br />
Problem with the human lands is that Westfall ends at a point that you should ideally go to Redridge. Loch Modan and Darkshore would be bad as you'd have to do the lesser quests to get the better ones, and by that point you're better off going to Ashenvale and Wetlands. Or so I think, at least.<br />
<br />
Er, long explanation short: Just go to Redridge. :P</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I don't know what it is, but I am really enjoying the horde side on a RP server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
too much running there imo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh. I loved Ashenvale, as I love Night Elves. It took a while to reach level 30 from there... Lots of running, of course. And we only have one town there. You guys have two. If planned right, though, Ashenvale wasn't too bad for leveling. It has a good deal of quests, though, as it's the next zone for night elves after Darkshore, which ends at 17-19, depending on how good you are at finding and finishing quests. Unless the NE goes to Wetlands or Duskwood, of course.</div></div><hr />

I'd say goto Redridge though I personally hate that zone, but it's a filler until you can goto Duskwood which is the best place to level to 30.</div></div><hr />

But maybe they've changed that. But I went to westfall/Redridge/Duskwood ASAP with my 2nd NE. Boring as it may be, you level quickly there.</div></div><hr />
