<br />
I noticed that the &quot;Mother Bear&quot; talent seems to be one that a lot of druids are passing on.  It almost seems like it could potentially be worth it.  For every member in your party when you shift into Dire Bear - you get a 3% Damage Reduction, not to mention the increase of attack power in Dire Bear by 2% with each rank.<br />
<br />
There are others that druids seem to be passing on, that based on tooltips seem like they'd actually be helpful in bear form.<br />
<br />
Feral Aggression, Predatory Instincts, Primal Tenacity and a few others seem to be passed on an awful lot.<br />
<br />
I realize that we're on a tighter budget now for feral talent point spending, and that many of us are already giving up our Resto talents to pick up more beneficial talents in Feral Combat, but I am a curious bear by nature.<br />
<br />
Another forum, when asked this exact question, gave some pretty uninformative answers...ie: &quot;I don't like the name 'mother bear' for a talent.  It's lame&quot; <br />
<br />
So, I wanted to hear from you guys what you thought about it, if you're picking it, or why you aren't.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much guys!  (Yes, I checked out Solarflash's projected spec - I was planning something very similar but was thinking of throwing a point in Mother Bear for the Damage Reduction instead of Imp MotW perhaps).</div></div><hr />

If you are planning on grouping a lot, then I'd throw in Mother Bear (or Protector of the Pack or whatever its called...)  Its in my current level 70 build, but I plan on tanking instances and raids.  However when I go to a DPS/leveling spec I'll skip it as it provides no benefit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-15-2008, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you guys both for the input.  I kept staring at it thinking &quot;What am I missing?  Why are tanking druids NOT picking Mother Bear up?&quot; <br />
<br />
I just couldn't figure out, with the other nerfs, why you wouldn't want to pick up an extra 12% damage reduction or so.  The 3% doesn't change with rank, so I imagine if you're doing it for pure DR, then you'd only really need 1 point in there, since there are a lot of weapons and trinkets that can increase feral AP.<br />
<br />
That would leave a few points open for other fun stuff.  <br />
<br />
Makes sense that PI would affect kitty more for DPS.<br />
<br />
A question on Mother Bear or PotP- For a 5 man group, obviously you're getting the benefit of 4 friendly party members.  Does this change in a raid?  Would you then see a benefit from the 9 other members?  Does it take &quot;you&quot; into account?<br />
<br />
Meaning, in a 5 man, do you get 15% DR or only 12% DR?  I've been scouring the web to find out and can't seem to find anything that states specifically...</div></div><hr />

No serious tanking druid can skip Mother Bear, though.  (I like the name Mother Bear better than Protector of the Pack! :thumbsup:  )<br />
<br />
Dest, that's been a source of confusion since the tooltip first came out.  I'll see if I can find out and get back to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like running instances, so I'm going to probably go with a tanking build, unless they release the dual specs.  That'll change things for me.</div></div><hr />

It's 12%. I did a Kara last night to test the new talents and you get a buff on you with 4 &quot;charges&quot; that shows you getting 12% DR even with 9 people around me. On a side note: the unlimited target swipe is completely insane. We were aeing everything in kara and I ended up #2 on the total damage chart for the raid due to swipe, the maul 2 target glyph and berserk mangles... and I was the MT.<br />
