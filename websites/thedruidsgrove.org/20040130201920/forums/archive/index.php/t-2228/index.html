<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>casualeq1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know a little about this from Allakazam and a few other boards. <br />
<br />
Ithiosar the Fallen is the NPC/dragon? that starts the ring.  I went by today and he wasnt up.  From talking to others I gather that this event is done rarely. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to spawn this NPC?  Are the other mobs in the cavern area PH for him?  Does he spawn and then depop after a certain time?<br />
<br />
Any information would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
