I'm wondering if there are any other items to help extend the duration of our DOTS?  I found a nice list on http://home.comcast.net/%7Eaelfin/downloads/DruidFocusGearHE.html.  Unfortunately I am not yet able to acquire any of those items listed.  Might there be an item that a pre-ele guild might be able to find or perhaps a tribute option I over looked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">11-22-2005, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">unfortunately that list is accurate.  the only viable option for detrimental extension replaces the only viable option for magic dot improvement if you want any shield other than ture's or vish's.<br />
 <br />
it's a huge roadblock I'm running into right now in my own equipment upgrade plan, as I'm doing the tongue quest and can't find a magic dot improving item to replace the qvic one.  my neck slot is already taken or I'd just wear it there.<br />
 <br />
so I'm freakin stuck too.  I'll be using my hammer of hours, qvic belt and orb of clinging death till I retire probably.<br />
 <br />
of course there are other options on the horizon with the bazu stone combines for those uber augs, but you pretty much have to be cutting edge to get those right now.</div></div><hr />

Belt of the Stagnant (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=47284) - Vindication of the Dragorn ( http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6474) - 30% Detrimental extended duration - Warden Hanvar drop.<br />
<br />
Get Hanvar belt, Tongue Quest in neck, and forget about that crappy CoD neck or AMV neck. Those Foci you can get on other slots.<br />
<br />
CoD neck effect (Alacrity of the Ikaav - Beneficial Haste) you can get on Anguish gloves, Mask of the Ancients, Yar Lir Back, Emperor Draygun leather arms.<br />
<br />
AMV neck (Warbeads) effect which btw is one rare item (Avariciousness of the Aneuk - detrimental mana pres) you can get on Yar Lir range (Crystallized Glass Staff) or OMM Back.</div></div><hr />

It's an LDoN aug from Butcherblock, costs 1150 I think, maybe more.  It extends DoTs.  That used to be pretty easy to get.  Unfortunately, with the more or less death of LDoNs now, it'll take a good while to get now.</div></div><hr />

Do druids have the highest amount of focuses they can use, compared to all other classes? Or is that just my imagination..<br />
 <br />
bene preservation / haste / duration / range<br />
detri preservation / haste / duration / range<br />

If you go by CoA/Vishi gear standards, then you will be lacking Dragon Frost (Replaced by Mask of the Ancients) and detrimental range.</div></div><hr />

The Symbol is a damage modifier though, and not an extension of the duration of the dot itself, like you'd find on Belt of the Stagnant or Facade of Fright.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, you took it literally and by Magelo :)<br />
Vishi eye quest is definately in my list of things to get, but it costs too much right now. The guild I'm in (Tide) got a lot of new people lately, including me, and that drove up the anguish legs / bp and vish eye prices a lot. I'll get it in a couple of months, cold focus isn't that important anyway.<br />
 <br />
To derail the topic even more - how valuable is extended range for you? Beneficial range is somewhat helpful, I can cure / heal more people without moving, but the ones I have to heal / cure should be near me anyways.<br />
 <br />
How about extended detrimental range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">11-25-2005, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get Hanvar belt, Tongue Quest in neck, and forget about that crappy CoD neck or AMV neck. Those Foci you can get on other slots.<br />

 <br />
For me it made a lot more sense to just stick with quarm bracer (txevu zun one works as well) for dentri haste since the depreciation on that is tiny (it's 23% @ 67 to 20% @ 70) then go hanvar belt and amv neck.<br />
 <br />
I just can't see myself giving up using time clicky when soloing and I know personaly that I won't swap it in just to click and remember to swap it out for mana pres on everything else. Also have 3 other range slot clickies on top of orb so it just seemed like it'd be too much of a pain getting a 5th range slot.<br />
 <br />
You can also get alacrity of the anuek now on emp's ring along with a chunk of stun resist.<br />
 <br />
But yeah think hoh, fear/hulcor mask, and hanvar belt are the only options for us that will add any ticks to dots. For all dots other than immo 20 to 30% will get you one extra tick only unless you combine a 30% with that awareness potion. Unless you can get a demi plane 35% any foci in that range will have the same effect for the majority of your dots<br />
 <br />
To derail the topic even more - how valuable is extended range for you?<br />
 <br />
I like it a lot, most dentrimental spells have a decent range on them so the end result is pretty sizable, and for short range (spore spiral) every bit is nice. It's particularly good for soloing, with magic dots it's like if you can see it you can cast on it almost. It's nice for either kiting or just running back to camp on a pull and getting half your dots on before it catches up.<br />
 <br />
oh and add dot pres / haste to that list hehe</div></div><hr />

Yea, i made the mistake of getting anguish legs and anguish gloves the day before we got druid gloves in DP. So I slap myself in the face.<br />
<br />
But trust me i'm in the same position as you. The prices have been driven up a bit on vishi items since we havent been doing him much but rather concentrating on DP. So i'm really screwed when it comes to mask of the ancients :p<br />
<br />
To be honest det range is the only foci i can leave out. I don't think it's that important, however you bet that I will try to find a spot on it if it's on a piece i like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">11-28-2005, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last Blood and cultural stuff makes it a bit easier to get that one focus you can't fit anywhere else. Like hat or bracer that generally doesn't have a focus. But of course the AAAA info and links of uber stuff with last blood augs has driven the price up there too...<br />
 <br />
Actually, some bazu seal of something or another might be able to add dot duration too.. not that it's easier to get than mask from mpg trial or even hanvar belt.</div></div><hr />

Vampiric Frost (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=7850&amp;source=Test)<br />
60% to Ice Nukes (Compared to Dragon Frost (Yar Lir Mask) which is 50%, and Frost of Anguish (CoA Pants) which is 45%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Jagged Gravestone of Affliction http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24884 in my Slaver's Buckler of Station http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31013 . It is my favorite combo ever. While the effect says it extends detrimental spells by 10%, I have noticed it seems to round up. It adds an extra 2 tics to most of my dots, and through some fluke 3 at times. The drawback is the max it will extend a detrimental spell is 3 tics. On snares and roots instead of the full 10% it goes 18 seconds longer. I do love it for root rotting. Those couple extra tics on each dot really add up.<br />
 <br />
The gravestone is an aug bought at the Butcher Block LDoN camp for 1450 points. On a quick sidenote, in the Mistmoore adventure Bloody Ancelle's Pouch will drop every now and then http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23257. It still fetches some nice plat in the bazaar. While on most servers LDoNs are history, if you ask around a lot of people are willing to do them, even if just for memory's sake. I took a week in the spring of 2005 and ground out enough points for this. If I remember correctly, it only took me about 5 nights. I like doing LDoNs, and at least on the Rodcet/Quellious server there is rarely a time I can't get a group together for one when I try. Good hunting.</div></div><hr />

Doh! It says right in the link its 70.2 - pretty sure it was the normal version too :)</div></div><hr />
