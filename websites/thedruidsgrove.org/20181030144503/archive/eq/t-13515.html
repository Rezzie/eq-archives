Upon completeing the Samples of Corruption as a raid, we decided to scout some. If you go all the way to the top of the Tower, there is a non descript bedtoom. It has a few smashed pieces of furnature, one bed straight across from the doorway, and a broken mirror on the wall behind the bed.<br />
<br />
I was talking on Ventrillo about it so more people came up and farted around there.. people started getting ready to leave when I was talking about Sullon probably spawning on this brown square area infront of the bed... that's when it happened... I accidentally clicked it and the floor opened. The raid rushed forward like children in a candy store.. loop after loop after loop all the way down this tunnel when WHAM.. we ran into the room SS'd below.<br />
