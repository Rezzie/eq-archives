(seems like a lot of us these days) I've been off a long time and no longer have a guild or many friends that I know of that still play.  I never bothered to get my epic and I was wonder, could a lvl 63 druid with ghetto gear solo his epic 1.0?  I thought that it might be a good way to get my feet wet as I figure out how to drive my druid again and learn about all the changes since I left.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

Here are the things that will give you some trouble solo.  Faydedar (soloable at 65 with PoTime/Qvic/Tacvi gear or 70 with grouped gear), Ulump (froggy in SonH, extremely resistant still was annoying to solo at 75 with CoA gear), Venril Sathir(soloed the spawned version several times, and you can probably find a partner to help seeing as he drops 2 pieces of the epic) and mabye the Jade Reaver(this part you can buy in baz though).  If you can find a nice person on your server to help you out, you could knock out these four things, or three if you buy the reaver, in under an hour.  But if you plan to level up to try to solo these things, the epic's power will be greatly diminished and only for getting epic 1.5/2.0 and a trophy.  Around that level it is still extremely helpful as a free 1,650 damage per click.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a side note: I already learned how to use the veterans reward that summons your corpse and gives you exp back.  I think that thing won't recharge fast enough for this death prone druid.<br />

 <br />
What server are you on?<br />
 <br />
Also there is LOTS of buyable upgrades that will probably seem huge for you.<br />
 <br />
I think if you do a few upgrades and get your hp/mana up you can do all but Fayder solo and maybe him depending on your fire resists.</div></div><hr />

A little tip for baking once you get 252 skill most people do Kaladim Constitutionals, and two components are little mushrooms that spawn in one of the Kaladims in a farm.  I suggest binding there and every time you die/gate you pick all 18(9 of each) and this should give you a decent stock seeing that you are a death prone druid like myself(I'm a tank on the inside!)  As for gear I'd suggest searching alla for gear from namers in Dragonscale from SoF, I know you said you didn't have the expansion but you can buy the gear and it rivals any other gear at that level obsolete it is like 260hp/mana+ with lots of mod2s and foci.</div></div><hr />
