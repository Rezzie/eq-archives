I found my disks and loaded up WoW off a wireless router connection. But when it was running the patch it stopped at 21% and said there was a Firewall blocking it. I had disabled the McAfee Firewall and the Vista Firewall was already disabled for some reason. <br />
Yet the download patch stops at 21% and then still says there is a firewall.<br />
The tech support at Dell tells me it must be because WoW is not yet compatible with Windows Vista.<br />
Anyone out there have Vista and WoW and both works fine?<br />
What else could it be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still use Windows XP but there are many people who've been able to run WoW fine with Windows Vista (beta and live).<br />
<br />
The Official WoW Technical Support Forums might be a good place to check.</div></div><hr />

There are better places to get patches, try Fileplanet or something similar ( Blizz lists some in their knowledge base as well ).  I have had a hard time downloading any sizeable patch through their downloader.  Under 5mb seems ok, above that and it just hangs.<br />
<br />
Personally I use Fileplanet.</div></div><hr />

Oh and hi, been a while etc, hope TDG is ticking along nicely.</div></div><hr />

I work as a tech on Dell Business Support. Even though I do not support inspiron / dimensions I know for a fact that this should work...<br />
<br />
GIve me the name of the tech you talked to and I'll give him some flaming ;)<br />
<br />
Seriously, I have a mate who has a XPS and he has Vista on that, no problems at all..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">06-18-2007, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've read Vista is just teh crap, don't know as I haven't tried it much, but when I was to install Civ4 on my sisters new comp with Vista, I get some error when I tried to load it saying that this program have compatible problems with WinVista.<br />
<br />
Read somewhere that not many games but those especially made for Vista (i.e Micro$oft games/program) work with it, doubt this tho, but stilll have problems.<br />
<br />
In my case, does DirectX 10 has something to do with it, does seem strange to me but many posts Ive read about games+vista points towards DirectX 10, could that really be it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">06-18-2007, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I run Civ4 and WoW on my machine and they both have no problems with Vista. Just click the &quot;I don't give a crap&quot;-button in the incompatibility-dialogues and you are good to go.<br />
<br />
But still, Vista is not a good operation system. It is slow, buggy and, at least for me, offers no advantages over XP (or even Win2k). So stay away from it!</div></div><hr />
