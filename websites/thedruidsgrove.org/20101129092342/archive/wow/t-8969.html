<br />
Now either I'm being incredibly stupid (feel free to tell me so) or there aren't any.<br />
<br />
So how come we can buy all these nice nifty leather pouches, satchels, backpacks and so forth, and we can make armour out of dragon scales and whatnot, but we don't seem to have the nous to make a bag out of leather.... while the tailors can make cloth ones.<br />
<br />
Seems a bit inconsistent to me.... can we have some leather bag patterns please... or could someone set my mind at rest that there is one, before I get much higher in leatherworking.  Might change my mind and become a tailor at this rate.<br />

Only bags (besides the kodo 6 slot - joke anyhow cause of the very low drop rate of thin kodo leather) we can make are ammo bags / quivers.  The upper end of leatherworking is pretty sparse.  Devilsaur sells well - and the 2 patterns are easy to get.  <br />
<br />
For elemental, Stormshroud sells probably not as well as Devil on my server, and I believe one of the 3 patterns is uncommon.<br />
<br />
Tribal is pretty pathetic in lack of recipes - or rather, lack of craftable items anyone would use.<br />
<br />
At lower levels, the Turtle Scale armor will sell - this is speaking from Horde side where Shaman love sta/int/agi.  <br />
<br />
Overall - there are no uber crafting recipes for Leather I'm aware of - on par with high end smithing or enchanting for example.  I chose it cause I wanted a leatherworker.  My 60 rogue is 300 alchemy.  The rest of my toons are/will be all Engineering (aside from the Tailor/Enchanter I made and haven't played much).  Smithing I positively don't have interest/patience to really level up in. Far easier to farm mats (with Engineer-miner) and have someone make you something you want.</div></div><hr />

And we got all the awesome patterns! at least, they are really easy to make. Ive been elemental 300, tribal 300 and dragonscale. around 300. <br />
<br />
Got lvl 300 tribal leather worker in lvl 41 without any help what so ever. And now i earn loads of gold by making http://www.thottbot.com/?i=36157 for people. Dont say that tribal leatherworking needs patterns. We got 4+ lvl 55 Rare items whos EASY to make and then a freakin epic healer cloack.</div></div><hr />
