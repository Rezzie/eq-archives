 <br />
I was wondering if anyone had any advice on leveling @ 52. Since I am on Zek, I am looking for a place that few people go to, since I have to worry constantly about getting ganked. (People love to try to whack wood elf druids, and they often fail)<br />
 <br />
Any Ideas? Any help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Use that link to help find zones appropriate to your level. I am not sure if you have to sign to see it or not.</div></div><hr />

Also at level 52 you got Call of Karana which charms mobs up to level 53, and in the.... southern corner of the zone there are about 20 ravenous nightstalkers (level 51 werewolves) which you can swarm kite easily.  I do this on my bard currently and im sure it is doable as a druid just dont aggro them all aggro like 4 at a time, snare them all then when you hit 53 load up glamour of tunare (druid animal tashani) and hit them all with that and charm 1 sic it on the pack and invis when it drops to around 10-15% hp, charm another sic it on that hurt one and it should finish it off.  Stock up atleast 5 AAs while doing this for Innate camo, you will be very glad you did.</div></div><hr />

I loved this place also, even way back when I used to hunt here it was fairly quiet. I am sure it is completely dead now.</div></div><hr />
