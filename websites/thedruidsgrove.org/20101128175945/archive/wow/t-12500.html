WotLK Druid Wish List...<br />
<br />
Ok.... you know you've dreamed of it.  I know I spend a decent amount of time thinking about what cool and unbelievable thing they could add to make Druids infinitely cooler in Wrath of the Lich King  What's on your wishlist????<br />
<br />
Mine:<br />
1.  Epic/Dire/Super Cool advance Kitty form.... they did it for bears... why not cats????<br />
2.  A water form worth using... ok yeah it works and you can breath under water, but I look like a weird mutated plucked chicken in the water... can't you at least make me look like a neat shark or dolphin or something equaly cool????  All I can say is THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE HORNS TOO!!! :p<br />

I've read that it is the combination of stealth and short cooldown rez that gives Blizzard concern about abuse.  So, why not make a high-level Resto talent that nerfs Prowl and gives you a new spell (or reduces the cooldown of rebirth to 10-15s) at the same time?  They could even require tree form to cast it (or put it low enough in the talent tree to prevent non-resto's from pickup the talent).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavin</div><div class="date">04-08-2008, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really happy with some of the changes recently put in place.  Switching instantly between forms without going into caster is my current favorite, especially when off tanking in Kara.  Being able to use a health potion with a macro while tanking has been really useful.  Lacerate scaling with atk pwr and affecting more mobs that it used to is great too!<br />
<br />
<br />
This next suggestion has been mentioned on the WoW forums for a year or so now but I am at work so I can't link it... <br />
<br />
I would like to have some way of choosing a different cat or bear model.  Possibly through a long quest chain.  Druids could choose a cat or bear model that exists in game and permanently adopt that form as their own.  Some have even suggested even branching out to other mobs beside cat or bear.  For example: Raptor for dps and Croc for Tank.<br />
<br />
Bizz would probably not go for this as druids could get confused with hunter pets in pvp, but I think it would be good to add some uniqueness to each druid.  How about some options to change coloring/markings on the existing bear and cat models?  I have been staring at the same bear butt for years!<br />
<br />
Pysonivy- do you mean a gradual health regen spell like troll's blood potions?  That is an interesting idea but I dont see that happening.  Dont warlocks already have that with Demon Armor?  Since we have so many hots that might be viewed as overpowered.  <br />
<br />
I would also really like to have another shout type spell for bear form.  The 10min taunt one is useful but demoralizing shout doesnt scale well.  What other shouts do warriors have?  Is there something that druids could have that would be unique?  I would take anything really... Here are some ideas.  Feel free to shoot any of them down.  <br />
<br />
Bear<br />
more crit or atk pwr for allies<br />
debuff that slows casting time- should have a 5 min cd<br />
an aoe fear (bears should be really scary, right?)<br />
<br />
Cat<br />
I would like to see a change to tiger's fury.  It doesnt scale at all.  Again, anything else would be better.  Plus to attack speed? Plus to dodge?  Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-09-2008, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warlocks Demon Armor does have a hp/5 component to it, but no one uses that cause Fel Armor is so much better:  Increases dmg done by 100, and healing received by 20% (untalented, can be increased by up to 30%).<br />
<br />
With all the HoT's druids have, I don't think that having a hp5 would be that useful.  Mana regen seems to be pretty good too.  I'd suggest, if anything, an increased move speed in tree form.  Or a second rez with a much shorter cd, only used out of combat (keep the in combat brez at 30 min, but give druids some sort of single rez that can be used if a group wipes and there are repops and a druid's brez is down so that he can stealth back in and rez a 'true' rezzer).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors have four shouts:  <br />
Battle Shout (increases atk power of party for 2 min)<br />
Demoralizing Shout (decreases atk power of mobs for 2 min)<br />
Challenging Shout (aoe taunt, 10 min cd)<br />
Commanding Shout (increases paryt health for 2 min)<br />
<br />
Warriors also have piercing howl (talent in fury tree) that decreases enemy's movement speed. <br />
<br />
Adding on an aoe atk power increase to druids wouldn't be that bad of an idea, and not too imba.  ...</div></div><hr />

Edit: Ok, but seriously? Dire cat form is a much needed idea. The whole stealth/res mechanic I remember being debated as long ago as patch 1.4 or so, when there were serious issues being voiced about the cheeseability of such mechanics. Honestly, I'd just like the Bearform model changed. I really dislike it, it's very angular and blocky...I mean what bear has a square-ish ass and 12 claws total?</div></div><hr />

Or perhaps a group HoT would be nice.  I remember in EQ my cleric had the ability to equalize the hit points in the party and then hit the group with a heal.  That was awesome.</div></div><hr />
