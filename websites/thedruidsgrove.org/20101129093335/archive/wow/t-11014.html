<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">08-29-2006, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea. I'm at a loss as to what to do.<br />
<br />
Right now my professions are Herbalism and Skinning. I have them both at 315 being a tauren. I also have the Bloodscythe for Herbalism and Finkle's Skinner and the +5skinning enchant.<br />
<br />
In a recent UBRS run, I've picked me up a Recipe for Flask of the Titans! (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=25326). I'm thinking if I should raise an alt to level 35 and give it Alchemy and Leatherworking or if I should drop Skinning and pick up Alchemy on my druid. The reason being is that I heard some of the alchemy recipes (Major Mana Potion) is BoP and my alt wouldn't have access to that (I never play alts).<br />
<br />
Just to see what you guys would do in this situation. Hopefully I described it well enough for you to understand.:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tough call.  Not sure what I'd do.  Maybe sell the plans.  They go for a decent amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">08-29-2006, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well a buddy of mine (who's also a druid) can create the flask of distilled wisdom and he's never set foot inside BWL so I'm pretty sure you don't need to be in BWL to make flasks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">08-29-2006, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright. I asked a couple guildies (None of them Alchemists, I'll ask my friend later) and they are under the knowledge that there's an Alchemy Lab in Scholomance. If so, I'm probably going to have to give alchemy to my druid and not an alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">08-29-2006, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you can only create flasks at the alchemy lab in Ras's room in Scholo.  Likewise, Scholo is where you get the Major Mana Pot recipie from a quest chain, which is BoP.  Alchemy is a great talent, and extremeley useful endgame.  Pretty easy to level it to 300 as well if you have herbalism.  <br />
<br />
I know a lot of people that have leveled alts to pick flowers / mine / skin for their mains, as traveling around gathering mats is more fun / worthwhile if you are getting experience doing it.  My priest has been my druid's herb dealer for a few months now :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">08-30-2006, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea. I'm gonna drop Skinning as soon as I can get all the herbs needed to powerlevel alchemy to 300. In the meanwhile, I'm gonna try and get some UBRS runs in to try my luck with the beast :) and black dragonscales. Skinning, gonna miss ya.<br />
<br />
Thanks for help guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakiniku</div><div class="date">08-30-2006, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so apparently there are two labs.  One in Scholo and one in BWL after Broodlord.  Since thats the case, I would roll and alt with herb/alch.  Finkle's isn't the easiest to get (in terms of time).  Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">08-30-2006, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I didn't have the guts to raise an alt to level 35, let alone high 50s and 60. You're right, Finkle's isn't the easiest to get but if I ever raise an alt to 60 or drop herbalism or alchemy for skinning again, I don't mind running UBRS tons.<br />
<br />
I got my Finkle's SKinner on my first UBRS run and have been in about 10 in total (Only 4 going as far as the Beast and I've seen it drop 1 other time.)</div></div><hr />
