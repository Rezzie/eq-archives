<br />
Im a PvP noob and i wonder if a 1/46/14 is best for PvP!<br />
<br />
My thoughts were, if mangle &gt; natures swiftness.<br />
something like 0/38/23 built!<br />
is mangle really that important in PvP?<br />
<br />
yesterday i saw a video of a 12/11/38 druid in PvP and he owned!<br />
resto in PvP?<br />
<br />
What do u think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">06-12-2007, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I use 1/46/14. But mainly for PvE. That it is nice in PvP is just a side-effect.<br />
Certainly this is not the ideal way to skill a PvP-druid, because survivability suffers without SoN. You deal A LOT of damage, but have no instant heal.<br />
<br />
IHMO the &quot;classic&quot; PvP build is 1/39/21 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zzZxMGssroezfZVAIz0o). One point for Nature's Grasp in balance, 21 für SoN in resto, and all the others in feral.<br />
You will not deal as much damage as with full feral, but you will survive many fights you would not otherwise.<br />
How you spread the 39 points in feral is pretty much up to your taste, but you should definitely get HotW and LotP/ILotP.<br />
<br />
Another interesting build would be to go balance/resto. Something around 27/0/34 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0tcrzicRZZxvc0xqM0s). That way you deal good damage and can heal pretty well. It is not suited for Pve very well, but in PvP it should be quite interesting to play.</div></div><hr />

I think its a pretty viable PVP build, IF you have a good mana pool..<br />
<br />
Try to aim for at least a manapool at 5.5K so you can shift/heal alot.. If you really want to get more shift and heal try to get some moonglade parts..<br />
<br />
I currently have 9K hp 5.7K mana and about 2.4K AP / 30% crit in full PVP gear, and I find it quite good.<br />
It dont have the really good survivability as the previous stated build (1/39/21) - but you will deal more damage..<br />
<br />
Its really up to playstyle as well. Test out a few specs for a week or something, see wich ones you like the best..<br />
<br />
But its nothing like jumping a warlock, hearing a clearcast sound and 4/5 shotting that piece of cloth...</div></div><hr />
