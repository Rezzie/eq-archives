<br />
Oh well I'm the kinda druid who will never settle down. <br />
Where the mobs are, you know that I'm around. <br />
I kite and I nuke 'em, cuz to me they're all the same<br />
I root 'em and I DoT 'em, they don't even know my name<br />
<br />
Cuz I'm a Wanderer...yeah I'm a wanderer<br />
I port around around around around<br />
<br />
Well, there's Naggy on left and Voxy on my right<br />
and the Efreeti is the mob that I'll be with tonite<br />
And VI askes which one I like the best<br />
I'll tear open my shroud and show 'em PharaDar on my chest<br />
<br />
Cuz I'm a Wanderer...yeah I'm a wanderer<br />
I port around around around around'<br />
<br />
Oh well I port from town to town<br />
I go through Norrath without a care<br />
And I'm as Happy as a clown<br />
with my 2 furry feet but I'm going nowhere<br />
<br />
Cuz I'm a Wanderer...yeah I'm a wanderer<br />
I port around around around around<br />

<br />
I made it through the wilderness<br />
Somehow I made it through<br />
Didn't know how leet I was<br />
Until I found you<br />
<br />
I was beat, incomplete<br />
I'd been had, I was sad and blue<br />
But you made me feel<br />
Yeah, you made me feel<br />
Shiny and new<br />
<br />
Like a druid<br />
Sowed for the very first time<br />
Like a druid<br />
When your leaves blow<br />
In my eyes<br />
<br />
Gonna click you day and night, toy<br />
My buffs are fading fast<br />
Been saving mana for mobs<br />
'Cause only dots can last<br />
<br />
You're so fine and you're mine<br />
Make me strong, yeah you make me wise<br />
Oh your dot wore off<br />
Yeah, your dot wore off<br />
Recast for mobs' demise<br />
<br />
Like a druid<br />
Sowed for the very first time<br />
Like a druid<br />
With your green leaves<br />
Before my eyes<br />
<br />
Oooh, oooh, oooh<br />
<br />
You're so fine and you're mine<br />
You'll blow leaves till the end of time<br />
'Cause you made me feel<br />
Yeah, you made me feel<br />
All minty fresh inside<br />
<br />
Like a druid<br />
Sowed for the very first time<br />
Like a druid<br />
With your green leaves<br />
In my eyes<br />
<br />
Like a druid, ooh, ooh<br />
Like a druid<br />
Feels so good inside<br />
When your leaves blow, and the dot sticks, and the mob dies<br />
<br />
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh<br />
Ooh, Norrath<br />
Can't you see my leaves blow<br />
For the very first time?</div></div><hr />
