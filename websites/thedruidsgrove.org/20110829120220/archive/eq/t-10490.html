Is there anything that is worth my while to melee with or should I stick with a book or something that just boosts stats?<br />
 <br />
I'm 53 and have 8k to spend.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I used is solely to train up my 1hs for my epic 1.  you can find it fairly often in Bazaar on Vazaelle for between 2500pp (what I got it at) and as high at 10k.  Just wait on it to drop, thats what I did.</div></div><hr />

You won't be doing much damage by meleeing anyway - it's far more efficient to do your damage with spells at this point. IMHO, get something with stats for your primary slot for now.</div></div><hr />
