My guild leader tanked it so I could do the hots on the statues.  Some heavy dps and healer from my guild came too.  Very fun fight.<br />
<br />
I am a casual player but I wanted to get it before the expansion.  Did double dailies with my druid main and alt hunter to get the 5K.  Totally worth it.</div></div><hr />

How'd hSethekk Halls go for you?  <br />
<br />
My group was a wipefest, but at least we kept making progress and got through it all.  &lt;3 my Epic Bird!</div></div><hr />

Now the last boss will kick your butt, but if the group struggles to finish the bird boss, I just stop at that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My +heal is sitting at 1438 buffed, a little weak for tougher heroics, the group as a whole is in T4/Badge gear, I've got one piece of each and a few assorted epics, and none of us had been in hSethekk Halls before.  Oh, the tank had once, to do his flight form quest like a year or so ago...  but hadn't tanked anything but Kara in many months, and that not often.<br />
<br />
Frost traps were resisted left and right, and one of the hunters is specced into better traps too.<br />
But we learned from our mistakes, actually did quite well at *oops* recovery, I think.  And managed to get Ikiss down too.<br />
<br />
I respect that instance, but I'm not afraid of it by any means.  I'm looking forward to a rematch when my guild's next druid needs to do the quest.</div></div><hr />

And with the large pulls, CC is just about required, though with the 3.0 patch coming soon, I plan to use hSH or the other hSH as a testing grounds of our new unlimited swipe target ability.<br />
<br />
What I tended to do on the 5 pulls was CC one and tank 3.  I'd tell the DPS'rs they better burn down skull (usually a caster type) ASAP since I'm not gonna touch it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavin</div><div class="date">09-30-2008, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a pretty smooth run.  All guild people.  A few deaths but no wipes.  One of the most fun runs I have done in a long time.<br />
<br />
Prot Warrior (Tank, guild leader)<br />
Holy Priest (Healer)<br />
Affliction Lock<br />
Elemental Shaman<br />
Feral Druid  (me)<br />
<br />
I got to do cat dps most of the way with some off tanking on the larger pulls.  It is always fun to do a run once in a while without the responsibility of tanking all the time.  <br />
<br />
The quest boss fight was really cool.  I put on caster healing gear and kept rejuv rank 1 on the three statues. I used wrath/moonfire on the boss and then used hurricane for the aoe part.  Minor dps on my part but that didnt really matter with the heavy dps we had.<br />
<br />
I did have some trouble keeping up with the other dps, but they raid a ton and my cat gear is Kara/blues The shaman and affliction lock got blasted and died during the last boss and then the priest kept getting polymorphed.  So I off-healed a little bit, tossed a brez on the shaman, popped tranquility and then continued to dps in cat.  Main tanking is cool and all but flexibility is why I love being a druid.  <br />
<br />
Oh and the flight form is wicked fast!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think my GM has druid envy :P<br />
<br />
back when i ran hSH for the quest, it was pretty tough... i needed my guild's help to down Anzu... we went with a boomkin that had the heals for the birds macro'd, so all i had to do was tank... it made my life much more pleasant... i think i posted about it right around a year ago...<br />
<br />
does anyone have that macro? my guild may want to start trying to farm the Anzu mount...<br />
<br />
i tried just using targeting macros one time after that, but that didn't go so well :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Swift Flight Form totally rocks and is about the best part of being a druid :)<br />
<br />
I love heroic sethhek.<br />
<br />
I've even been lucky enough to get Anzu as my mount :)<br />
<br />
We still go back and run it as often as possible in the hope he drops again for a guildie.<br />
<br />
We usually run with :<br />
<br />
Me, feral tank<br />
Holy Priest<br />
2 mages<br />
Rogue or a DPS Shammy<br />
<br />
So at Anzu i tank him then do the HOT's on the statues as soon as the birds arrive before resuming Bear when he comes back.......works no problem.</div></div><hr />

I had read that you needed a non-tank druid to keep the hots up for the entire fight.  I have the 3 macros for rejuv rank 1.  I will try that next time if I am tanking.</div></div><hr />

i can never remember whcih spirit does what so i'm just trying to keep them all going !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me, too.  Once I figured it out, I put he macros in order in the macro &quot;folder&quot; so I don't have to remember again.<br />
<br />
Eagle is the one that does AoE damage and is by far the most important of the 3 (during the AoE phase).<br />
<br />
From wowhead comments...<br />
<br />
The Hawk gives an aura that reduces all party members physical damage taken by 500.<br />
The Eagle gives an aura that deals 300 dps to all enemies in the room<br />
The Falcon gives an aura granting all party members 10% haste (movement, attack, casting)</div></div><hr />
