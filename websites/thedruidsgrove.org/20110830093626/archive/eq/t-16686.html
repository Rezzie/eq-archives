<br />
I am using macui now, its nice, but I am sure there are some more druid oriented ones out there, right?<br />
<br />
Yes I have been to eqinterface.com but even then its like a needle in a haystack.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions!</div></div><hr />

Can't remember his name, something King, have some very nice interface (if you like the artfully created interfaces rather than the functional/simplistic interfaces).<br />
<br />
I personally prefer Sars with a few modifications (bags and bank from Minimalist) or for my laptop where screenspace is an issue, I use Minimalist:<br />

Most of what I use is the original UI, with a few pieces to make things easier for me.<br />

Check it out and download any pieces you might want here:<br />

Note that the buff windows have changed slightly since the screenshot (they are smaller and the blue color is a different shade) because of a SOE patch that forced me to replace them.  Anyone who has any problem, please let me know and I'll fix it.  I'm afraid I haven't downloaded and installed what I have posted onto a fresh system to make sure it works without tweaking, I just put up copies of my own stuff.</div></div><hr />

I need to spend some time fiddling with the different ones apparently. I do like the macnew, but his inventory/clicky slots arent what I need so thats one I will end up changing/replacing for sure.</div></div><hr />

Seems more and more the good ui makers of old aren't keeping up with patches.   So I've resorted to using the default with some other things taken from things I like.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
In fact, I love it so much, not only does my druid have it, but so does every alt.<br />

Wasnt that bad as an exwebdesigner (pre xml) but of course now I have the problem that I am upgrading and changing equipment so quickly that my customizations are no longer valid. :)<br />
<br />
I will hold off until I get a little more upgraded and go through and make changes again. Once I get more comfortable with playing - comes back pretty fast - I will make more changes/swaps to the ui.</div></div><hr />
