<br />
Does anyone have ideas regarding the fastest way to raise DoN faction starting out with nothing whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Is it faster to kill guards or do the tasks? Is there a specific task at each tier (0, 1, 2, etc.) that is best to do? I took a cursory glance through the quests and there didn't look like there was a lot of overlap.<br />
<br />
How many hours would you estimate to complete everything? (exclude pick up raids necessary to progress) Is it better to save faction tokens until after indifferent? Or some other faction level?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />

Guards are 20 min repop and are attached at the hip so I dont know of anyway to split them, I was told it wasnt possible so we just rolled them over 2 at a time and then the rest are singles. I think there are 4-5 total guards. They summon, but they cant hit too hard... I went back a second time and duoed them with an 80 bard in pairs without even trying, when she needed faction.<br />
<br />
You can turn down the task offered and keep requesting until you get the lavaspiners silk task. I had the best success with Elayne the male guard that looks kind of prissy. ;)<br />
<br />
Make sure when you get the quest that you are getting the right faction... seems stupid to mention but its easy to pick up the wrong quest from the wrong giver when you are just starting in LS.<br />
<br />
I was told guards were the fastest faction but it was just as easy to go add the Lavaspinners task on while we waited for repops.<br />
<br />
I think after that its pretty linear but you can pick up raids that you arent to yet in the progression and complete them but you dont get credit until you have done the prereqs... someone correct me if I am wrong on that one, but I got it from someone I know has done it all.</div></div><hr />

Also, does killing guards for faction max out at indifferent or can you do them all the way through Ally?</div></div><hr />

Once we got the crew to mission faction level we stopped guard killing. Unless we find pickup raids we will never progress past Tier 2, but thats ok, those first two bonuses were worth the minimal effort.</div></div><hr />

I've also tried zoning and accepting/removing the task, but I keep getting the same, non-silk collecting quests over and over again after I finished it the first time. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />
