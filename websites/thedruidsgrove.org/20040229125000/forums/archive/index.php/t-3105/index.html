<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaliet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Everyone. I just made level 15 on my Human Druid and I have the entire Pine Druid Newbie Armor and the Pine Druid Scimitar. <br />
What I would like to know is how many more levels this Armor and sword is good for and what I need to look for. I don't have much Plat.<br />
BTW I am on the Prexus server and my name is Baena if you want to say hello. I really havn't met anyone there yet. People usually just want  me to buff them up adn thats ok but it sure would be nice to meet some other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faedia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should start working on new armor, but the quest stuff isn't worn out yet.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of items you can look for in the range of 200pp or less, and you can make that easily by selling things like Spiderling Silks, Spiders Silks, animal pelts, certain kinds of meats, and other things that a level 15 druid can easily hunt/forage.<br />
<br />
If you have Luclin (I recommend buying it if you don't), do searches in the Bazaar for Druid useable items. Focus on Wisdom, Mana, and HP while searching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>lonewylfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, my 41 druid just got rid of her newbie leggings (the Kelethin quest leggings). I had the money to upgrade, but spent it on other equipment instead.<br />
A lot of the druid newbie armor seems worthwhile to keep until you get better gear, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's all a matter of cost v. benefit.  For example, if you had 200pp laying around, I'd recommend a couple of switches that would be big improvements relative to your quested armor (e.g. Othmir fur cap for ~75pp, Chipped Bone Bracelet ~150pp).  <br />
<br />
Three other tips to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
1) Your spells are your #1 priority.  Never sacrifice spell cash for gear upgrades, IMO.  If you have a choice to upgrade an armor slot for 100pp or buy most of your lvl 19 spells, go with the spells.<br />
<br />
2) Spend some time in the Bazaar.  Get to know price ranges for particular items.  In your case, look for +Wis items that would be be the biggest improvement for the least pp.  I've had a lot of success targeting an item or two, then watching the prices and being able to pick one up on &quot;sale&quot; when the time is right.  It may take a few weeks, but it's very gratifying to get an upgrade at a bargain price.<br />
<br />
3) Keep focus effects in mind.  These items make a HUGE difference at lower levels.  If you Root/DoT, try to get an Extended Affliction I or II item at all costs.  Mana Preservation I or II is extremely helpful too and can be had on several sub-1K items.  <br />
<br />
Just my perspective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaorin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You want a Mana Conservation I item go do the Testament of Vanear quest.  This I think is a must item for low level (and even mid-high is nice) +10 Wis and +10 mana (although wis is whats best of the two) plus Mana Preservation 1 to boot although this only will work on your spells up to level 19 (though I do see it glow when I cast higher level spells which makes me wonder)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ailuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Testament of Vanear should be a required quest for every druid.  I just recently got rid of mine at 44....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think.</div></div><hr />
