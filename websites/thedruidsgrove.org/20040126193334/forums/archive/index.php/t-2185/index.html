<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Autius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone give me any tips about spawning the tainted gorilla?  I've follow Ally's advice, been hunting around top of stairs at plateau, but can't seem to get them to spawn.  Somebody had mentioned that there is a 3 gorilla spawn near top of stairs, but I can't find it sigh...<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you try killing the live (not undead) tottering gorillas?  I did that for an hour or two and got the tainted, as far as I can remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's not near the top of the stairs, you need to kill the gorillas in the NW corner. (after you reach the top of the stairs)  There are only three tottering gorillas trackable in the NW corner, keep killing them as they respawn and the tainted will appear sooner or later.  Just keep in mind that undead tainted gorillas will not spawn a corrupted, just kill it like a normal tottering so that hopefully the next spawn will be a live tainted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bound in the absolute NW corner of the zone so I could gate back to track after each kill.  I got the tainted to spawn after about 90 mins I'd guess.<br />
