<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nalaan Walker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am new to charm kiting.  I am recet 55 so I have tunares request.  I do not have CoK.  Someone (59) druid told me Tunare's request is not that good compared to CoK.... Is he serious?  Also does Charisma gear help with charming?<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BriennaMonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Before I quit, I did a lot of charm soloing.  This is going from memory here, so hope I remember right :) <br />
<br />
Tunare's request lasts longer, but is limited to a lower level of animal max than CoK.<br />
<br />
So you can get a higher level pet with CoK than with TR, but TR is less unpredictable.<br />
<br />
As for Charisma, there are people who swear that it helps.  There are others who swear just as vehemently that it doesn't help.  Personally, what I found most helpful was AC/HP gear.  That way when your charm broke (and it most definitely will), you can take a few hits.  This is especially important in PoP zones where the mobs can hit very very hard.  Of course the harder they hit, the better pets they make :) <br />
<br />
It's ok to sacrifice wisdom for ac and hitpoints when charm soloing.  If you do it right and are careful, you don't use much mana anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tunare's Request is a piece of trash.  Max pet level is 35 (which makes for a useless pet at 55), it costs 130 more mana than CoK, and takes 3 more seconds to cast.  It's higher level than CoK because the pet won't aggro when charm breaks, but if you can't handle a charm break you really shouldn't be charming.  To charm after level 51 you really need CoK or CoT, and as for charisma it does make a difference but it's so small I don't bother trading out gear to boost it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You want to use Call of Karana.<br />
<br />
Tunare's Request is best saved for player generated quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nalaan Walker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now those are helpful posts.  Thanks for the advice.  I will begin the adventures in charm kiting immediately.  I already bought the CoK spell.  Thanks again.<br />

<br />
Now if only it were easier to get voice graft!  I've yet to even see the mob that drops the preserved chokidai vocal cords...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't need voice graft, just imagination.<br />
<br />
Of course it was more fun when WC and Oasis were not deserted.  I use to have much fun way back when with Tunare's Request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nalaan Walker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am now lost in an entirely new direction.  Do I even want to ask what a player generated quest is?  Or do I want to save everyone the trouble, and pretend I didn't read that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RetlawEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It works like this:<br />
1) Charm a mob<br />
2) Use Voice Graft<br />
3) What you type out now comes out of your charmed pet<br />
4) You then have people interact with your pet, as you talk through it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, it worked more like this.<br />
<br />
1) charm a mob<br />
2) buff the mob out the wazzoo<br />
3) put some trinket on the the mob<br />
4) egress<br />
5) let the zone know that you will give a reward for return of the trinket.<br />
<br />
You will probably understand why WC and Oasis were the best places to do this, if you remember the way that WC and Oasis use to be.  Tunare's Request(it still breaks naturally as other charms do, just minus the agro) was just the spell of choice, 3 and 5 were optional too, depending.<br />
<br />
Player generated quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps if you dispell TR, or invis to break it, you will still get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You get aggro if you invis to break it?  That's silly...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was just thinking it would be nifty to charm something, go into treeform, and start making my pet talk. :) <br />
<br />
Or just a fun trick to throw in during a long exp group...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lyanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Necro I knew used to use voice graft and his pet in Black Burrow to freak out the newbies.  He'd just stand around the corner while people talked to the unusual 'npc'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ClaeophaRah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You don't get aggro on a Tunare's Request pet by invis breaking it, unless you are/were KoS to that animal to begin with or did something else to make it mad.<br />
<br />
For instance - Using Glamour of Tunare to make Tunare's Request last longer will aggro the mob, and so it will be aggro when charm breaks.<br />
<br />
I've gone through NK shrinking all the griffs with TRequest/Tiny Companion.  They look so cute when they're small.  =)<br />

<br />
Yes definitely silly, but fun!</div></div><hr />
