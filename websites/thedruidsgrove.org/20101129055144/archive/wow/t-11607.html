<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elvenlust</div><div class="date">03-02-2007, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really never enjoyed meeleing ever, feral is not my thing. Balance is great fun though, I like it for soloing, instancing, and PvP.<br />
I've hit level 29 and want to get quite a few marks from both of the bg's at my level. While im doing okay in PvP my tactics are quite crude. I heal mainly with the 2 second cast rejuv when I have a solid front line protecting me as well as root.<br />
My main problem is a run out of mana so extreamly quick and easy. Between buffing, healing, rooting, and damage spells im spread very thin and really lack any powerful gimmick. (you know like the mage's presence of mind + pyroblast, the locks dot + fear ect ect) <br />
My equipment is mainly cloth blues with some leather that I was able to find good caster stats on. It just seems silly that I have 3200 mana and I run out in pvp so quickly and then stand there looking pretty until i get wacked. I could shapechange I suppose (after poping a mana potion) but even with an item swapper my cat and bear don't seem to be very useful.<br />
<br />
Well I suppose I should end this before it becomes a novel. My basic question is what do you caster druids who are successful at PVP do? Is it bettter to go for the talent that increases critical damage, or is the stun chance of starfire (usually after a root) and 70% uninterruptable machine gun wrath better? Should I focus more heavily on my mana. I hear int is a fairly poor stat to boost in PVP but the reason behind that is that you die before your mana is depleated. (Which ovbiously isnt the case) Finally am I doing myself a great injustice by not utilizing cat and bear form. If so when is the right time to switch from caster to meele (Which seems far less useful to a battleground team then someone who can root cast and heal)<br />
<br />
Anyway I hope to hear what you all have to say tword optimizing my spellcasting for PVP.</div></div><hr />

This works especially well if your near the tunnel on either side. I usually start out the fight with a starfire to get their attention (trick is to determine their speed so your sure to get it off). Follow that up with moonfire and then root and finished em off how you like. Bear form is great to use agaisnt melee classes w/ the armor + heal. I usually use cat form just for the stealthed movement or dash if i'm about to be overwhealmed. Stick with the more crit dmg talents if you can, I went back tho and filled in the &quot;machine gun wrath&quot; and couple that with the must have Natures Grace its perfect.</div></div><hr />
