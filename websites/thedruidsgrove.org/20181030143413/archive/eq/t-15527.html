Dabloons = Pirates<br />
Orux = Katta<br />
Not looking at game now so not sure on the exact names of the other 2 currencies, but I was lead to believe that 1 of these currencies is for raids.  This would account for 3 of the currencies, so where do you get the 4th currency?<br />

<br />
One should be for raid trash, and one for raid named.<br />
<br />
I believe that is what was decided, but I may be mistaken.</div></div><hr />

Phosphites for raid level power sources.<br />

Or vice versa, don't recall offhand and not in game atm to verify.<br />
The spelling is probably incorrect as well  :)<br />
<br />
Open up the &quot;elite&quot; level merchants, and while you won't see anything to purchase, you'll still see zero specified currency available to spend.</div></div><hr />

Correct... <br />
<br />
If your guild is not raiding TBS.. your going to use Orum currency which buys you armor that is less then TSS.   My suggestion.... stick with TSS armor if you dont have a good guild.. its better then normal TBS armor and patterns and power sources are 1 groupable.<br />
<br />
<br />
..and yes even with the new infusions..</div></div><hr />

TBS Ally is BETTER then TSS with powersources....it has base 40-60hp/m and it has more spell shielding and dot shielding and 10more avoidance.<br />
 <br />
And we have 4 more foci on the gear....we now have access to Cold, Magic, Detri/beneficial spell haste (hoping this will get bumped a little or condensed to one spot)<br />
 <br />
TSS was fire (tbs has fire too), heal (tbs has heal on bp) and thats it.<br />

show me one pieces of your (or mine for that matter) of tss gear that is better?...now if you were thinking citizens then yes you are correct.</div></div><hr />

Phosphenes are used to buy both raid level visible armor and rk. III spells. The rk. III spells are way overpriced right now though, so I don't expect anyone to be spending phosphenes on them for the tiny upgrades they provide.<br />
<br />
Phosphites (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=79913) drop off the trash in Solteris and are used to buy the most powerful Energeian powersources.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Powdwar</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Infusible means that equipping a power source in the new slot will have an impact on the stats of that item. Be warned though that some adjustments from power sources will be positive and some negative. For example you may lose hp to gain mana. The purity number on an infusible item determines how much of an impact the power source will have on it.</div></div><hr />
