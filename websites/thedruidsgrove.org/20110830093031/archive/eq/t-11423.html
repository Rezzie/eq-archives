When/If we get new character models, I'd like a specific armor set type for each class to be reserved for 'epic armor'. That way, we can have a set of Shadowknight plate armor, for example, that looks dark and gloomy and has some cloudy particle effects and Paladin armor would be white and have a certain 'glow' to it. A set of rogue armor that looks like a dark chain, and they have a hood for concealment. Stuff like that.<br />
 <br />
If you've ever played or seen FFXI, I envison having something similar to their Artifact Armor quests, which were really well done in my opinion.<br />
