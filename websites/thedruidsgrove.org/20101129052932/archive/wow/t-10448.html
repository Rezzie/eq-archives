<br />
AV waits and suck, and recently I found that I've gone AFK waiting for AV to ding, only to be instantly kicked out of AV for being AFK *sigh*.  Then you get the stupid &quot;Deserter&quot; mark and can't queue for another 10 min *ARGH*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horde if I waited for more then 30 seconds, I was pissed, usually you get the join box as soon as you queue.  Alliance on Uther wait for an hour or more most nights.. it's all about population imbalance.<br />

Use this site, on any server the side with the lesser # of players has shorter wait times for BG's.  On 85% of servers, horde has the smaller pop.</div></div><hr />

I don't do WSG much or anything but I've been in queue for about 15 times...I got in once (my first time) before I got tired of waiting and left the queue and logged off....</div></div><hr />
