<br />
With the arenas coming I know a good healer will make or break a team.  <br />
<br />
I was thinking about either taking my druid to higher levels or rerolling another class (probably paladin) for pvp healing.  I've tried a priest in the bg's we have now and really don't like it.  They die too fast for me.</div></div><hr />

Paladin is quite good at this I believe but a resto specced druid should do pretty good as long as you get swiftmend and natures swiftness. You just need to know when to go into bear form and when to run like hell!</div></div><hr />

A paladin is extremely mana efficient though and if you don't do something about his mana, he's likely to heal all day long. There's also nothing more frustrating than a paladin healing groupmates while he's immune, but it's really the only thing they have to heal under fire, whereas with swiftmend and NS you can dish out some heavy healing on the run if you have to.<br />
<br />
That said, priests are nasty too but they make for prime targets by the other group.<br />
<br />
I don't have a priest or a paladin, but if I were to pick one of the 3 specifically on healing ability in pvp I'd prolly take the druid, just  because you can avoid being targeted first alot of times because of stealth etc. Can't really go wrong though they're all powerful imnsho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as tactics go, I'd pick a druid. Why? Stealth. What better way to suddenly surprise your opponent than seeing a druid shift out and start healing the other guy? I saw a video of a tauren druid doing arena battles with a rogue, mage, warlock, and maybe another class. They did pretty well from what I saw, as the druid would stealth in and stay near enough to heal. When his opponent got low, he'd heal them. Or, he'd sometimes attack one of them from stealth. Either way, I think the druid would be best for arena battles, just for that reason. Also, I agree with the previous reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All 3 can do really well in the hands of a good player, but I'd personally go with druid or pally too.  I've seen holy pallies rock group pvp, and I know druids can too.  Just go with what you enjoy most I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">12-05-2006, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One advantage to a druid healer is you can be by your partner and the enemy won't know exactly where you are (arena) or if you're even there (BG/World PVP) which can make for a nasty surprise and get them to blow cooldowns etc before they know their target has back up. <br />
<br />
Other than that, player skill &gt; class every time. If you're a good healer, you'll be a good healer whichever class you choose, if you aren't, you won't be :p</div></div><hr />
