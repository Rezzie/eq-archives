<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unloved</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We know that EQ has developed proximity sensors to determine that appropriately flagged or appropriately itemized players are triggering certain events or spawns.<br />
 <br />
My question is whether it's possible to get some hint as to whether the South Karana Coven spawn is supposed to be triggered by something. We know they spawn at midnight, but:<br />
 <br />
1) Is it supposed to be every midnight, or random?<br />
2) Must the toon have something in their inventory, like the furtive figure note?<br />
3) Does anything prevent the spawn, like having one of the Coven drops on you, or is there some serverside flag that says you're done with the event?<br />
 <br />
We're having a particularly hard time with this step. We get our guild involved in everything we do... We've already pulled our guild down to the rings 6 times, once an hour every hour, over the course of an entire evening with no spawns. And if we wait for the spawn, we can't get the entire guild to drop what they're doing and scramble there within 10 mins. I don't mind multi-hour, random spawns as long as it's just me, but I can't ask my guild to come down every hour all day long just in case it might pop, or to sit around and stare at the empty ring all day long on my behalf doing nothing else.<br />
 <br />
I would presume that the Coven event would spawn when a druid with the furtive figure note is standing at the rings at midnight. We tried killing the furtive figure again, thinking maybe it would reset some serverside flag that the druid needed Coven, but he didn't drop his note the second time (unless having the prior one on the druid at the time prevented it from showing up on the corpse).</div></div><hr />

However, since the note is not no drop, that kind of puts a wrinkle in it.  I would guess alternately that being flagged past the runed head might.</div></div><hr />

I realize the reasoning behind this is probably so you don't have one druid standing there and everyone else just killing the spawns, but sheesh.. come on.. Just do a quick check. Note+flag /spawn .. No note/No flag../no spawn<br />
Ahhhh.. I love how everything is working as intended... ummm...rriiiiiigghhtttt...<br />
:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unloved</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'm just concerned that without more information about what might be wrong, we're just yanking our guild back and forth for no reason, because we're missing some flag or something somewhere. Or if it truly is just a random spawn, it'd be nice to know that so we can stop worrying that it's our fault somehow.<br />
 <br />
With the new quest capabilities, there's a lot more that can have gone wrong for the player, opening a whole new range of possibilities for points of failure. In the past, we could have just assumed it was either a timed, placeholdered, or triggered spawn (ie, player turns something in). Nowadays, with proximity sensors checking your inventory for certain items, the number of failure points (ie, player just isn't holding the right item on their person, maybe it's in the bank, etc) makes the whole process of determining what's wrong nearly impossible. We could stare at this ring for months not realizing that we're just lacking a flag or item to trigger it... all I know is we can't keep bringing the guild down to the ring every hour for another no-show.<br />
 <br />
Maybe we could have an NPC where where we turn the furtive figure note in, NPC keeps the note and despawns, and triggers the spawn at the next midnight. If we fail the event, we can always kill the furtive figure again for another note. And make the note NoDrop of course.<br />
 <br />
I don't mind random spawns, and I don't mind quick despawns... but both together either means you gotta have your entire guild staring at the rings all (real) day long, or have an incredibly narrow window of opportunity to pull your guild from whatever they're doing to the middle of SK within 10 minutes, of which I find neither realistically feasible. There's making a quest difficult (&quot;sheesh that mob hits hard!&quot;) and there's making a quest pointlessly frustrating (&quot;sheesh, I've been staring at a blank wall for 14 hours now&quot;).</div></div><hr />

IMO any druid anywhere in the SK zone with the note should trigger the coven spawn. I say this because after the patch I logged on and ran to SK at about 11pm. I was in the SK zone but not near the druid ring at midnight (got that instant lag at midnight I seem to get when they do spawn) and when I did arrive at the ring they were there. I was theonly one in the zone.<br />
<br />
I would say if you have any of the crystals to delete them, delete the note and start at the FF, since he doesnt seem to drop another unless you delete the one you have. <br />
<br />
edit** Also might want to talk to Silanda in Abysmal again but not sure if this is needed before covens. <br />
<br />
Also, the covens seem a tad harder since the patch.</div></div><hr />

And regardless of whether we solo it or not, your advanced uberness seems to have completely missed my blatant point that it's not spawning. Evidently your elite uberness has contributed to your profound case of illiteracy, or perhaps you were just naturally gifted with the inability to comprehend the written language. Perhaps your sig should read &quot;I am the illiterate incarnate&quot; too.<br />
 <br />
This all seemed to clear up after the last patch. IMO any druid anywhere in the SK zone with the note should trigger the coven spawn.It was working for several spawns immediately after the patch. We wiped one time, and we killed one and looted one crystal the next spawn. It's never respawned since.<br />
 <br />
We have checked every EQ midnight for 12 hours today, not a single spawn. Have redone FF. A previous druid said she had some crystals on her when they spawned, and I'd hate to destroy them on guess after our guild managed to procure one for us. Like you said, our druid had the note on her when we killed the FF again (hadn't yet destroyed the original note) and corpse was empty. Our druid put her crystal in the bank (thinking maybe it was interfering with it being on her person) but it's still a no-show too.<br />
 <br />
Prior to the patch (and this may be a moot point as such), yet another druid reported that she logged in late to check on them, they were already up and part way through their script, and nobody else was in the zone. Which led us to believe (at least prior to the patch) that they were capable of spawning on their own, independent of any other factors. Of course, this may have been a particular trait of the pre-patch spawner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unloved</div><div class="date">10-15-2004, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time, we backtracked by killing the furtive figure again. The druid still had her previous note on her when we killed him. We noticed that we did NOT get the message &quot;The Mind Crystal grows warm&quot; and the furtive figure did NOT drop his note again.<br />
 <br />
This time, we went back to Abysmal Sea and redid the part there (hail the chick, talk about the stabilizer and mind crystal, hand in the mind crystal), druid gave me her previous note so it wasn't on her, and we DID get the &quot;Mind Crystal grows warm&quot; message and the furtive figure DID drop the note this time.<br />

He agreed, and lo and behold, at midnight the coven spawned.  This was my first time getting them to spawn with my note, which might have been why they spawned that time.  Having gotten two of my crystals, i stuck around for 4 more midnights to get another spawn.  Nothing.  <br />
<br />
It could be coincidence that I showed up with my virgin note and they spawned.  Or not.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />

I returned to the ring at 10pm with my fresh note, and at midnight, no coven spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unloved</div><div class="date">10-16-2004, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same here Zeph. We deleted our note, backtracked to Abysmal, had the Mind Crystal glow warm, killed the FF, looted a new one, and still negative spawns for Coven. <br />
 <br />
We've talked to druids that have come and gone with perfect spawns right on time for them since the patch, every time. We are still zero for over two real days now, with two of us covering a watch of 15+ hours a day. It seems other druids show up (in the middle of the night, we just watch), it spawns, they leave, and then for hours and hours and hours with just us there, nothing.<br />
 <br />
We've done everything correctly up to this point, just like everyone else. It did spawn for us both pre-patch and post-patch, but we haven't successfully completed it yet. We have 1 crystal. It never spawned for us since.<br />
 <br />
I'm loathe to destroy our one crystal, but it's the only thing we possibly have that could be stopping it. Like you said, maybe you were the one that spawned it for the previous druid. Our druid's crystal is in the bank, I have no idea if it checks that far... we've been staring at this thing for going on three real days now, watching other druids come and go with ease, I'd really like to hear if this is correct behavior or not.<br />
 <br />
It could at least give us some emote clue as to why it doesn't spawn... &quot;Seeing the blood of the Coven on your hands, the members silently disappear into the wind!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I agree.  Sat through another midnight with no coven after my last report -- that makes about 5 or 6 tonight... I lose track :)<br />

<br />
lol - I love that. You should write for SoE. But I doubt they want to give us that much help. <br />
<br />
I really think one should delete any crystals AND the note. Then kill FF again and get fresh note. If you're not getting a note there is a problem. Be sure to delete it not give to someone (just in case, heck you don't need 2). <br />
<br />
If someone is getting spawn while you watch it's cause they are spawning them. You wont get a spawn after they leave. I'd make sure ALL druids in zone do not have any crystals just to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unloved</div><div class="date">10-16-2004, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was talk that the note had to be on your top inventory for the quest trigger to see it. I can affirm that this is not the case, at least for the FF... Mind Crystal did not grow warm, and FF did not drop note, when our druid had her note buried in a backpack.<br />
 <br />
However, the next time around she gave the note to me (necro), the Mind Crystal grew warm and the FF dropped his note. <br />
 <br />
So the trigger obviously saw her note even though it was buried in a backpack, and prevented her from obtaining another one. As soon as she gave the note away, the Mind Crystal/FF part worked again.<br />
 <br />
I see this as proof that the new quest system will deny loot if you already have something in your inventory, top-level or not. I'm begining to think you may be right with the crystal we have as well.<br />
 <br />
I'd like to try the FF part again, this time with her note in the bank. I'm curious if it searches your bank account as well. It's pretty easy to check, either the Mind Crystal grows warm or it doesn't. Then destroy the note from the bank and see if the behavior changes.</div></div><hr />

We were the only players in the zone, and this was the first spawn we got since we looted a single crystal almost 2 (real) days earlier. You MUST have the hasty note and you must NOT have any previous crystals on you for the spawn to happen.<br />
 <br />
Other druids that satisfy this requirement in the zone could still spawn it by simply being present, but that's because of their presence, not yours.<br />
 <br />
Having the note, and not having the previous crystals, includes both your personal inventory *AND* your bank. It's sorta doing a type of Lore Item check, to see if you DO have the note and do NOT have any previous crystals.</div></div><hr />

The reason he was having trouble with the coven is because he already had a crystal on him and to trigger the NPC you must have the NOTE open and no crystals on you or in the bank to make this work. Reason I know this is because at the time I didnt know the rules to trigger the 3 NPC untill I read this thread (thank you to all who posted here) I being the nice person i am helped the other druid get his other 2 crystals and i looted the other crystal. I then waited for coven to spawn again, 12 midnight came and went no coven, ok try again, 12 midnight came and went a 2nd time, at this point I knew something was wrong, only i didnt know what, so I came here druids grove. after reading this thread, I logged back into EQ and i destroyed my note and my lone crystal went back to south qeynos killed the Furtive figure got the new note went back to south karana , guess what coven spawned had no trouble kill the 3 NPC and looted my 3 crystals . Im happy to say i have 4 fights left and ill be 1.5 epic carrying =). <br />
