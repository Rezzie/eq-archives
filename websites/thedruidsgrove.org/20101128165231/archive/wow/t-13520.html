I usually don't bother much with the holiday things on the first day or two unless there are parts I can work on that don't involve me having to battle with my own faction or even the horde to do. I tend to be very impatient with these things- since they aren't a &quot;normal&quot; part of playing and take me away from other things I'm working on...I have zero patience for a same-faction gankfest...I really got lucky with this one.  I was on late a few nights and ended up doing most of the more irritating achievements when it was a little quieter on server =)</div></div><hr />

We grouped up and three of us ran in to keep the horde busy while one plopped into a chair.  Then we just rotated through til everyone had it. =)</div></div><hr />
