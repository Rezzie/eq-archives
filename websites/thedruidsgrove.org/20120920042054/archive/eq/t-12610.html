My druid is 65 and used primarily to 2box heal my warrior so i'm mostly concerned with how quickly I can get him to be an effective healer.  He's level 65 in essentially all ornate gear.  So far I have:<br />
run 3<br />
metab 3<br />
scm 3<br />
healing adept 3<br />
mental clarity 1<br />
<br />
I'm wondering what other aa's I should go for and in what order?<br />
healing gift<br />
advanced healing adept<br />
advanced healing gift<br />
mental clairty 2-3<br />
planar power<br />
innate enlightenment<br />
others?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or help or heck even point me to the right threads (which I've looked for and not found) is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Another spell slot is always nice.<br />
 <br />
Spirit of the Wood/Grove/Convergence of Spirits. (PoPAbility/Omens/DoD)  A mana free clickie heal is always nice even if you only get level 1 of SotW.  If you want to get the strong single target hot, then you have to work through them all up to CoS.<br />
 <br />
Innate/Shared Camo (Class/DoD)<br />
For when you need to invis the druid or both the war and druid.  Insta cast, 20min base duration fixed invis.<br />
 <br />
Exodus (Class)<br />
Depending on where you hunt, this can become invaluable.  If you are tanking with the war and things are going south, this will be able to save you to fight another day without having to summon to the GL.<br />
 <br />
I believe all of those are available to a level 65.  SotG/CoS may not be for all levels, you can check the link for all druid aa requirements/descriptions.</div></div><hr />

Exodus is &lt;3.  Spirit of the Wood/Grove is nice as well.  HG and HA lines would be best to go for first if 2-box healing is what you're using your druid for imo.</div></div><hr />
