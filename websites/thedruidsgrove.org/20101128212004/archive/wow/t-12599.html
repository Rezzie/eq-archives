S3 Gloves (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33671):<br />
Armor: 343<br />
Str: 31<br />
Agi: 32<br />
Sta: 44<br />
Hit Rating: 9<br />
Res: 22<br />

T4 Gloves (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29097):<br />
Armor: 475<br />
Str: 32<br />
Agi: 24<br />
Sta: 28<br />
<br />
Assuming I don't need the +res from the S3 gloves, does the 132 extra armor (pre-bear) of the T4 gloves make up for the loss of 8 agi, 16sta and 9 HR?</div></div><hr />

I personally prefer the armor to the stamina, but 200 HP and another .5% dodge is nothing to scoff at. And they absolutely will help with removing the clefthoof set bonus. I'd probably keep both around, and swap as needed against certain bosses. Against really hard-hitting bosses I'd want the extra armor, so when you're taking on Gruul or Mags or something, put on the gloves. When you're doing prince, you'll want the HP and hit.</div></div><hr />

I so rarely maim in PvE, I've never looked for it.  Maybe I will tonight as I often maim those paladin type mobs on the Isle when I'm doing my dailies to interrupt their heal.</div></div><hr />

I assume the list is rather short.For Kara? Nightbane for sure. Curator possibly. Maiden if she's feeling frisky. For 5-man, some of the random odd bosses here and there might be useful, though most don't hit all that hard. <br />
<br />
What about for multi-mob trash? Armor or Health/dodge?I'd personally want armor for multimobs. Reducing multiple attacks by 2% is a bit more valuable than 200HP. <br />

Really, I'd almost always prefer the armor to the stam. Stam is good, and avoidance is good, but armor reduces damage in a consistant, predictable way - and that's the key to making a  bear tank so easily healable. Where I'd want more stam is against fights with a lot of spelldamage flying around. So heroic MrT, Prince, Slabs, Illhoof, Aran...that sort of thing.<br />

Eh, if you don't maim bosses it doesn't matter, really. It's about the interrupt. A maim on QD does just fine, as it stuns 'em. It's the stun immune bosses that the interrupt ability kicks in.</div></div><hr />
