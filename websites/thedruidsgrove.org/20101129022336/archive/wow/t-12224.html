<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-28-2007, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Word on the street (http://www.resto4life.com/index.php/2007/11/27/trinketed-lifebloom-nerfed-on-ptr/) is Blizzard has fixed the bug which enabled you to prolong a trinket's +healing benefits well past the initial 15-20 second duration simply by renewing the HoT before it expired. It affected Lifebloom, Rejuv and Regrowth.<br />
<br />
For those of you unaware of this; as you know, our HoTs get a +healing bonus from the +healing bonus Use effects on the trinkets. Right now, you're able to retain that +healing effect as long as your HoTs never ran out on the target. This was often used by some druids on Lifebloom, cause of its ability to stack x3.<br />
<br />
Personally, I see this being a fix, even though everybody is calling it a nerf. Trinkets were meant to be a limited time buff. Prolonging the benefits by merely updating your HoT is more an exploit than &quot;intended effects.&quot; <br />
<br />
Now, I'll be honest, I used this, too. But these days, I used it purely to pad the healing meters. :biggrin: <br />
<br />
I'm sure some resto druids would be effected by this. But me? I never replied upon it, which means I won't be effected. Honestly, I'm surprised it took them this long to fix this.</div></div><hr />

The poison would continue to get the initial AP buff (bestial wrath, bladefist, etc.) as long as the stack was kept up.  This allowed Scorpid pets to do 700DPS on their own thru an entire boss encounter with very little management.  It was fixed in 2.2.</div></div><hr />
