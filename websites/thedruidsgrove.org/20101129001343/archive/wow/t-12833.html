I'm guessing my leveling tree will look a little different, but here's what I'm thinking for raiding. I feel I need to test talents like genesis and eclipse out before committing, and I have a feeling that oom-ness and threat will still be somwhat of an issue for us. <br />

Yeah, it's great -- more Lunar Guidance, more Dreamstate. And with the patch 2.4.0 boost to how spirit and intellect factor into mana regen... I only see great things.<br />
<br />
The regen talents Hunting Party by a SV hunter and VT by a shadowpriest now also looks at your max mana. I'd wanna take advantage of this as much as I can.</div></div><hr />

There are too many good talents you can't pick them all.  So its kind of a crap shoot what you should aim for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-23-2008, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear not, h00tkins.  I has read blue posts that indicate Blizzard still have a lot of tinkering to do in the Balance tree.  Their feeling appears to be that h00tkins have not received enough attention over the years and they seem keen to get it right this time.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
They mentioned this just as they were announcing changes that freed up 3 talent points in the Feral tree - so it's not a huge jump of the imagination to see them doing something similar to the Balance tree.  :&gt;<br />

i'm sure some more experienced oomkins will give me pointers on some talents i really need that i've missed out !  to me trying to work out the relative merits of the ones that increase bonus type damage is mind boggling !</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">11-10-2008, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well after extensive testing on my part during Mount Hyjal and Black Temple raids I have confirmed the following.<br />
<br />
Check spell rotation with Eclipse and noted the following.<br />
- IS,MF,SF,SF repeat has 300 more dps than<br />
- IS,MF,SF/Wrath(change every time eclipse hits) repeat had 130 more dps than<br />
- IS,MF,Wrath repeat<br />
<br />
Top rotation also did not go below 70% mana even when Bloodlust was used while the bottom two rotation did eventually make me go oom.<br />
<br />
This was tested base on only boss fights. (I toppped dps on hyjal trash by spamming hurricane ftw!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Both of those spell rotations only needed one MF per fight since I have glyph of SF (Kazrogal started with 13 sec MF dot and fight ended with same dot at 25 sec :P )<br />
<br />
Thus I have concluded:<br />
-eclipse sucks way 2 much to be considdered as an effective talent.<br />
-spamming starfire is the best rotation for boss fights (but can be so boring).<br />
-FF has not been tested but can up your dps quite a bit as well.<br />
-Furor is awsome and the only resto talent I took in my boomkin spec.</div></div><hr />
