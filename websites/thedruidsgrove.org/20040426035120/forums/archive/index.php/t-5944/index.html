The battle of Minas Tirith had my jaw in my lap for quite a while.  My only complaint was that the ending dragged out a bit, but it pretty much did in the book too.  Overall it's  A+ :)<br />

Oh, one small spoiler... Legolas &gt; an elephant :D</div></div><hr />

Great flick.<br />
<br />
My biggest complaint was all the slowmo shots.  Minor.  Distracting.  And when you have a 3 hour movie, that has been obviously pared down for time, I would think as a director one would use real time, not slowmo.<br />
<br />
Other minor complaint was Eowyn.  He makes her a major player, kills the number 1 ring wraith even, by herself.  Love interest for Aragorn.  And at the end scene, where everybody is patting each other on the back, good job.  Nothing.  She is missing from the whole scene.  And when the elf shows up and gets huggy kissy on Aragorn, not even a reaction shot?<br />
<br />
Epic.</div></div><hr />

Well, I assumed he simply cut out the portion of the book where she falls in love with Faramir, since it would have added at least 20 mins to the movie to explain it lol.<br />
<br />
And well, he didn't make her kill the Nazgul King by herself...he pretty much died the same way he died in the book.  Merry stabs in him the back of the leg and Eowyn kills him.<br />
<br />
The only thing I didn't like is how early he revealed the rider who grabs Merry is Eowyn.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree.  Arwen is a bit part in the books.  She is such a bit part that she is actually pretty much just an appendix (Appendix:  Aragorn and Arwen.  Seriously.)  She makes her major appearance at the end of the book when she marries Aragorn.  First time I read the book, I thought &quot;who's this Arwen chick?&quot;.  My husband laughs at me because everytime I see her on screen (at home, I don't like to yell stuff out in theaters) I yell &quot;BIT PART!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just saw the movie today. It was soooooooooooo good! Absolutely loved the ending. The only thing I wish they would have gone into more was Faramyre (spelling sorry) after his father died. After that entire episode, he just dropped out of the storyline, until the end when they showed a small clip of him and the kings niece, which I assume was eluding to a love interest between those two (I haven't read the last book though so that's just a guess). My fav. part though was when Merry was singing to the steward as he sent his son and the other warriors to their death. That was put together really well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, they did such a great job! The special effects were awesome and it was fun to finally see the end of the story. :) <br />
<br />
P.S. it took all my will power to not read this thread until after I saw the movie ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jinjre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The only thing I wish they would have gone into more was Faramyre (spelling sorry) after his father died. <br />
<br />
Faramir was wounded when his father tried to burn him alive.  The reason we don't see him is because he is recovering from his nearly fatal injuries at Osgiliath.  In the book there is a very very long section showing those who were recovering from injuries, however, it was left out of the movie (I assume due to time issues).  <br />
<br />
Since you haven't read the book, I won't tell you what happens during the recovery section, but I will say that there are 2 hobbits, a king, a princess, and the steward of Gondor, plus one really annoying woman who can't shut up (who never makes an appearance in the movie, but would have made a great character for comic relief).</div></div><hr />

Saruman and Gandalf are both powerful wizards, right?  How come we never really see them do anything wizardly.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>palamin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">In the books the 5 istari, gandalf, saruman, radagast, and the other 2 blue wizards, rarely used their magic. The general reasoning was to keep a low profile and casting spells was like a homing beacon. It was like an I am here please kill me.  Gandalf used magic quite a few times in The Hobbit. The istari were more or less to advise the people of middle earth to bring down sauron, and otherwise contain him to mordor and prevent him from finding the one ring and otherwise conquering middle earth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">My thoughts:  (MUCHO SPOILERAGE)<br />
<br />
* Gollem (Andy Sirkis) deserves an ocar, a star, a handprint, and whatever else he wants.  That was the best movie experience I have ever had with an anamated character over these three movies.  I never once saw him as anything other then gollem/Smeagle...  Perfect in every way.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on RoTK:<br />
<br />
* I think it was the perfect MOVIE end to the story.  Except for a few trifiling points:<br />
<br />
- For those that read the books, I think we all were missing the &quot;true&quot; ending at the SHIRE, but honestly there was not enough time.  I really hope that this true ending will be in the extended edition because it was what truly showed how much these hobbits had grown.<br />
<br />
- Aragorn taking the &quot;crown&quot; of Gondor was really half-assed done.  It was built up as this incredible thing to do, and then all of the sudden he was like &quot;OK, I'll do it&quot; and then he gets the crown.  No dialog from ANYONE in Gondor about his ascention... Very half-assed.<br />
<br />
- The fall of Farimir trying to take back Osgillith... With Pippin singing a tune, and Denathor eathing food (Spiting out blood and juices)... It was just a bit too much like an &quot;Obsession&quot; comercial.<br />
<br />
-  Sam not using the ring to get into the Orc hideout, instead SOMEHOW.. All the orcs decide to kill each other... hmm CONVIENIENT...<br />
<br />
- They make the big deal that &quot;SAM&quot; took the ring from Frodo and not orcs (Whew!), but they reveal &quot;Eowyn&quot; as the rider who picks up Merry right away.  Very opposite of the books.<br />
<br />
-  Cut out about 20 minutes of &quot;Homoerotic stares&quot; from the male cast members, and I might not have had to take a piss in the middle of the movie.<br />
<br />
-  Leave out the final trip on the boat... It was less important then other scenes they cut out.<br />
<br />
-  I would have desired a &quot;reward&quot; scene for the hobbits. because, If Paldor had done that quest, Walked though a dozen zones without teleports or SoW, had to kill a mountain of orcs with the constant (you are hungry, you are thirsty messsages) lost a ring of power I would have had to destroy.. I am going to want a quest reward.. mmmmkay?<br />

<br />
haha! I'm glad someone else pointed that out. The first of those stares came from Legolas in Rivendale. I thought, what an odd look, thinking there was some deeper meaning behind his stare...then there was Sam and the way he stared at frodo constantly and everyone else but there was no meaning behind any of them. They definately could have left those looks out of the movie.</div></div><hr />

One I really missed that no one mentioned was why is the Steward so crazy (besides Boromir's death)?  Read the books and find out or hopefully we will see in the extended edition :P It was hinted at in the movie.  I also missed Aragon's challenge to Sauron and all the other Aragon stuff that was left out for time, hopefully all that will be back in as well.<br />

There was actually only one that I thought was bad, the rest didn't bother me at all and actually were pretty true to the book.  The look at the end between Frodo and Sam when Frodo is going to leave on the boat, I swear a passionate kiss could have followed that look.  Honestly though, Sam is extremely devoted to Frodo in the book and all the other &quot;looks&quot; seemed in context to me anyway.  Oh, and did anyone else think it was odd that Sam was not in Bag End at the end of the movie like he should of been?  At least it didn't appear to be Bag End.</div></div><hr />
