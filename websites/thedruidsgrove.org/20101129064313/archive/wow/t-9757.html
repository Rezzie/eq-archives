The fight started out well.  I was in cat form and hit the Paladin a few times before they noticed what was going on.  I thought 'This is going to be over soon'. <br />
<br />
But then something happened.  I couldn't hit them at all.  Next 15 attacks (swipe, claw, moonfire, insect swarm, etc.) didn't work.  The Paladin was immune to then all. I don't know if this is normal of if this is extremely unlucky.<br />
<br />
Worst comes to worse they meleed me 4 times with 300+ crit EACH.  I have never seen anything like this.  At the end of the battle I was owned.  I never have seen someone at an even level be immune to that many attacks and get 4 crits in a row.<br />
<br />
Anyone ever experience this before?  Any tips for fighting Paladins?  Anything will help - I don't want to get totally owned like that again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, paladins have plate armor from level 1, so cat form is not the way to go. You might start in cat form, but then switch to caster or bear. Remember to heal when you're low on life.</div></div><hr />

Most people dont consider them a dps class but if they get a crit or two combined with a Seal of command proc or two they can put out some huge burst damage. Unfortunately for them its nothing they can control and its very random.<br />
<br />
 On the point of armor I think they start out with the ability to wear mail and once they hit lvl 40 they can upgrade to plate.<br />
<br />
 One pally in my guild loves to group with me because with his crit gear on and my LotP buff he has 30% crit chance. I have seen him absolutely rip people apart in seconds. I remember once in AB we both came up behind a mage, I stealthed, and we hit him at the same time. I crit for 1806 and he crit for 2200 I think it was. That poor guy must have **** himself.</div></div><hr />

Only way to fight a pally is in bear form,  their ac is way too high for cat, and you'll be oom by the time they use their shield if you just cast on them.   Depending on who you're fighting, you can try and bash when they're low on hp and shift out to finish them off , but smart pallies will start healing at or around 50%, so that's hard to do sometimes.  They have a 5 second stun on a 1 minute timer, so do not let your health fall below 50% if possible.  That's it for now I guess, I'll post more if it comes to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will start out bear, whittle them down, when they are low and bubble to health, i will switch to cat form and build up some combo points. Switch to bear, whittle some more, switch to cat, get some more combo points (remember you KEEP combo points no matter what form you are in as long as you do not untarget the player/npc). Once i have 5 combo points, i  begin the process of whittling them down. Once they get low enough, but not low enough to bubble, ill try to hit them with a 5 point full energy + tiger's fury ferocious bite and pray for a crit. If they let themselves get low enough, and it crits, its usually game over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, he can't kill you either, all you have to do is run away =D<br />
<br />
A properly spec'd Pally will have two shields, and a 3/4 LoH every two minutes and well timed use of mana pots.</div></div><hr />

Skilled Pally v skilled Druid is a infinite stalemate. And IF he gets the upper hand.. you can, as said, just run away.. he can't catch you unless he's doing engineering tricks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-03-2006, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1v1 means you want to get the jump or get the upper hand early.  Against healing classes it's more of a mana efficiency battle than anything else.  You place a stun or silence at just the right moment and burst out the rest of their health.<br />
<br />
This sounds dumb but it's worked for me a few times.  Get a few yards, feral charge, caster, moonfire spam, bear, bash, caster, moonfire spam, engineering bomb, moonfire spam.  If you see the shield come up after that and he's not oom (as you will be), run.  If you click fast and use all three tricks you should be able to get 1.5k damage out of that moonfire spam.<br />
<br />
omg, did I just tell someone to moonfire spam?  Kill me now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meen</div><div class="date">01-04-2006, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im starting to gank pallies pretty bad after months endless fights. <br />
what always happens is that he heals when u get him down to 25% and u do the same and then the fight starts all over again... <br />
now, what u gotta do is to make sure that at one point in the fight, the pally is at 20-25% health and that u have one stun left and are high on health. u stun the dewd and then u go catform. when the stun wears off, he always tries to break u down because ur in catform and he thinks itll be easy, so he takes a chance. however, u can bring him from 25%-0 much quicker than he can bring u from 100%-0.<br />
<br />
anyway, it works for me almost every time now :)</div></div><hr />
