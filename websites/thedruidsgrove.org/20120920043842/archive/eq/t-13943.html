There is a package deal (Titanium??) which has all expansion except Prophecy of Ro, all for about $30.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since you asked about soloing, and you probably aren't in a raiding guild, my suggestion would be to go for AA's, and not to go above level 65 for now.  PoP has a few good hunting spots for that level, with PoS and HoH being the two best.  Also, Noble's Causeway in OoW would be good for that level.  Concentrate on zones with mobs within 5 levels of yourself, so that you get bonus XP.  And the HoH basement camps will net you parchments which are turned in for your level 61-64 spells.<br />

I had caught an account up on expansions, buying I think four of 'em right before the package was announced, grrr.</div></div><hr />
