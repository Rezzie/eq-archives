<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">12-01-2007, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure if this is because of the loss of reptile skin to draw aggro to the tank, which I used to do a lot, but I am drawing aggro all over the place when I used to only grab it here and there. I have gotten the first 2 new tiers of spell casting subtelty, and I don't use the Winter's Flame or Nature's Blazing Wrath upgrades, since I don't have them. The only new spell I am using is Sunsear, and that is only in some raid situations and soloing. I also use our 2.0. I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this? Maybe they broke the first tiers of spell casting subtelty when they added in the new ones?<br />
 <br />
I can get aggro off any tank easily. I've gotten it from 4 of my guild's top warriors, 2 on a regular basis, 2 of the paladins on a regular basis, and various SKs all over the place. The rest I haven't grouped with. I mean easily too, I'll let the mob get to 85% or so before I start casting my usual spells in group situations and still get mobs on me. I've had a few raid mobs like me too, which has only ever happened with Fiddleback before if I use our immolation line and go overboard with fire damage. This is what made me think it couldn't be from losing reptile skin, which is what I chalked it up to in the first place. Is this a bug with me or something else?</div></div><hr />

Only waiting til 97% then opening with storm strike debuffs and dot set. <br />
I am using the new fire and swarm dots also plus usually Entrap (AA snare).<br />
Only times have seen agro is if mt dies or mob memblurs<br />
If I hit it too early, pally stun, SK, or tank can get off me pretty quick<br />

You might try keeping spore spiral up. root park mob so tank can gain fast agro. Remember rooted mobs agro on closest target so be careful in tight quarters you don't get a robe smooshed.</div></div><hr />

With my regular groups I play CC a lot, but with the others no one listens if I say rooting, move away, etc. No one backs up, no one gets further away than the tank, etc. If it's between that and dying I root and let them deal with not listening, but most of the time it's not worth it.</div></div><hr />
