Not to say that normal xp camping isnt, but there's a lot of different places you can go do to that.  LDoN is essentially 5 zones, and the timer makes socializing difficult.</div></div><hr />

Should have been the expansion between velious, luclin, definatly before pop. It is way to repetitive for my tastes even though I kill the same stuff over and over to exp and aa off of. I like variety.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't doing the level 65 hard adventures there are hardly ever any drops, and the ones that you do get aren't suitable for your level.<br />
<br />
I haven't done many simply because of the nightmare that pickup groups have been for me. I occasionally get a reasonable group but most of the time I end up screaming at my screen for most of it :p It's become nearly impossible now to even get a group, since most of the players have maxed out what they wanted and have moved on so I am stuck with no one to play with most of the time. It would have been a cool idea if there was more to do and they took out the time constraint / group requirements and scaled the dungeon to account for the fact that you had a reduced number of people. These would be great if you could bring as few or as many people with you as you wanted and have your own personal dungeon crawl.<br />
<br />
I burned out on them and I think I did 20! they are just too repetative. Now I will only go if I already have a group and someone happens to bring it up.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy meeting new people when guildies aren't available. I have been on over 300 adventures and have only had a handful of failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerodol</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I think that LDoN has served to fractionalize many smaller, non-raiding, guilds. I know from my experience that I used to be able to get a group with anyone in my guild at almost any time. Ever since LDoN came out you have to be within 7 levels of the lowest member of the group. While that wouldn't be a problem for my druid, my SK (who I play almost exclusively now) is only level 56 and cannot group with many of the people that I used to be able to group with.<br />
<br />
Another thing that I think it has caused is cliques within guilds. My guild did not have them before LDoN, but now, the same people group on a regular schedule and always in a LDoN. We have set aside one night a week to raid with an allied guild, but other than that, you can count on logging in every night and seeing the same people in the same groups in one LDoN zone or another. And since I don't do pick-up groups and I want to play with my guildies, I am also stuck with the same people in our group night after night.<br />
<br />
In short, LDoN has made the game boring to me.</div></div><hr />

I was very happy to get a group that would assist me, since I hadn't grouped before, They taught me well on the multi-roles that a druid can play in a group. Good time all around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole who's guild is at elemental level, or whos killed mob X this week with PoP was something everyone was interested in.<br />
<br />
The whos group has done 15 adventures this week or which guild has the most people in the top 10 if of little interest to anyone.<br />
<br />
Other than collecting some points (none of which Ive even spent yet) theres no progression, you just do the same zones again and again.  Even if getting 10 wins in 1 location opened up a few more maps that would be something, but for 2hp/mana on my charm its just a place to make some easy xp and pretty good xp for those not elemental flagged.</div></div><hr />

Check out my enchanters profile.  He is almost 3000 hp's unbuffed (profile is a bit out of date as I added a great mask from LDON last night).  3k unbuffed hp's is unheard of outside of a raiding guild.  Thank you LDoN for giving me a true alternative to raiding.</div></div><hr />

Personally, the points (gear/augs)+drops+quick pace more than make up for the lack of experience. Normal LDONs also allow me to do more in a group situation then I normally would - as they are pretty effortless now, I can easily spend most of my time nuking or even melee'ing with little concern to teh group. The drops in normals are decent Tribute point loot as well.<br />
<br />
The hard LDONs are great for experience with a good guild group, and the gear - while not quite elemental, really helps save that ph4t bkp for Time/GoD drops. Since an elemental upgrade isnt THAT much better, it keeps me for spending points like mad. My fullly augmented legs from MM (760pts) rivals a lot of elemental drops due to the three slot capacity. Some of the drops in Hard are still upgrades to hold me over as well - or if nothing else great solo (FT) gear. <br />
<br />
I agree they need to be scaled per the # of people on the adventure though. 3 people try LDON cause they cant find more - not to handicap themselves.<br />

It is so hard to make a pickup ldon group in my server, may be they ought to evaluate the LDoN trader prices.</div></div><hr />

Getting as many as 2 yellows per adventure isn't a bad deal for the hour and a half.  We ended up going back a little while ago and tried to beat some of the raids that were deemed far to difficult to be worth during LDoN.  Two nights of post-normal raid fun, we managed to beat the last 2 of them.  They were pretty fun and surprisingly complex!  The augs dropped weren't too great, but they all did find homes with mains on the raid, so I guess they weren't too bad!</div></div><hr />
