<br />
Here is the situation: My husband bought me my own account so that I could lvl up with him.  I made a druid to group with his shaman, but hes already 63.  I'm only 32 atm and I'm looking for suggestions to catch up with him really quick.  Any ideas?<br />
<br />
btw, atm Im a feral druid, but I'm thinking of respecing Balance once I'm 40.</div></div><hr />

Period.  Now to complete quests quickly, it probably make sense to follow a questing guide.  Check out Jame's (http://www.wow-pro.com/node/692) Horde and Alliance leveling guides.  I hear they are nice (and free).  I bought Joana's Horde leveling guide more than a year ago and love it.  But at the time, Jame didn't have a Horde guide.  Otherwise I would have used his.<br />
<br />
I would stay Feral until you are much higher level before switching to Balance.  For one thing, there isn't a whole lot of Balance gear pre-BC.  So, for solo questing it make more sense to stay Feral as Rogue/Kitty gear is readily available (and gets better once you reach the Outlands).<br />
<br />
Maybe stay Feral until 58-60.  During the first few levels in the Outlands make sure you pick Balance quest rewards if/when you don't want the Kitty reward.  That way when you make the switch you'll have a solid kit to start off.  I've been doing a similar thing with Restro gear, I now have 10 pieces in my Restro kit after completing all of the HFP and 7+ Zangamarsh quests.  Along with a full Kitty set (wearing) and 4-5 pieces for my bear kit.<br />
<br />
That's the one nice thing about being a Druid, just about every quest reward (in the Outlands) is worth keeping for one kit or another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As tlb says, one of the fastest ways to level up is to do lots of quests in an organised, efficient manner.  Guides are great for this.<br />
<br />
It's also worth having a copy of Wowhead (www.wowhead.com) open all the time; if you need help with any kind of quest, just type it in and it will show you everything in exacting detail  :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
At level 32 you are ideally placed to do the quests in Shimmering Flats, which are an excellent source of experience.  Get your husband to escort you there if you're worried about the journey.<br />

I just finished them on an alt and they were all good exp and some of them use some of the more interesting quest mechanics that weren't available when the old zones were first made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">12-12-2007, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is important to emphasize that with the recent 2.3 changes (increased quest reward XP by as much as 44% and decreased XP required to level), completing quest is the key.  If the quest requires you to grind a million mobs for some stupid drop, forget it.  There are plenty of quests to go around.<br />
<br />
Plus don't forget to maximize your rest XP (always log off in big cities or inns), especially if you are a casual player (I typically gain 1-2 &quot;bubbles&quot; of rest XP per day regardless of level).<br />
<br />
I went from lvl ~40 thru 70 with my hunter and never left rest XP.  With my current Druid, I've been in rest XP since the mid-40s (though it helps that I went on vacation for 5-days after I hit 50 and have been sick a few days after hitting lvl 62).  Unless I go on an instance run spree there is no way I'll exceed my rest XP bar before I ding 70.  That is a lot of &quot;free&quot; XP.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.  Might want to have your buddy start a new alt just so you have someone to play with that is the same level.  Even if he discards the toon after reaching the level of his current character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going from Crossroads to Ashenvale?<br />
<br />
Kill anything near the road while you run.<br />
<br />
Sure it'll add about 5 minutes to your run or so...but the killing XP coupled with the quest XP will level you in no time.<br />
<br />
Also, try to do a quest when it's RED in your quest log, get some help and pound it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">12-13-2007, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try and use Lightheaded (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7017-LightHeaded.html). It's an awesome addon that links your quest window to wowhead. You will never have to tab out to look up a quest ever again, for the most part. That saves a ton of time doing quests.<br />
<br />
When you open up your quest window (L key) it has a tab with all the comments from the quest discussion on wowhead. I even use it on dial-up when I'm at work.</div></div><hr />

It's an awesome addon that links your quest window to wowhead. I installed this last night, along with TomTom (simple loc addon with waypoint integration with LightHeaded) and DoubleWide (displays quest log index and quest description side-by-side for easier reading and less scrollng).  Those three addons should be required for anyone wanting to level.  They are great!<br />
<br />
I do wish there was some way to clear all way points in TomTom via a single command.  If you don't run over the way point, it doesn't automatically disappear.  So, after a couple of quests there may be a few extra waypoint dots on your map that you have to manually clear.</div></div><hr />

Even playing casually the last few days I've made it almost to lvl 36.  I'm looking for a good place to go.  I've tried stv, but I'm on a pvp server and I keep getting killed by higher lvl players.  Heading to Desolace right now and I hope it's a good place because I know that there will be a lot less ally there heh<br />

thanks so much.</div></div><hr />

Given the recent XP changes in 2.3, you just might be able to avoid it completely.  Though there is a ton of XP in that zone.  In my experience it is, by far, the worst PvP zone in the game (I didn't quest in the Hillsbrad zone).  In fact, I've had almost zero problems in every other zone.</div></div><hr />

Or just reroll on a PvE server. I didn't want to have my game interrupted by idiots. I don't get much play time as it is.</div></div><hr />

Try Arathi Highlands / Alterac Mountains or even Desolace (there are a good handful of quests, just the zone was my least favourite leveling on my druid although I enjoyed it a tad more on my priest).<br />
<br />
I REALLY TRULY ABSOL-100%-LY RECOMMEND HITTING DUSTWALLOW @ 38. I've read/heard too many good things about that zone now. I haven't gone thru there personally but general consensus seems to tell me that if you start it at 38, you should make you're way into 40-41 area no problem just doing Dustwallow. Great alternative to STV I suppose.</div></div><hr />

That's what I ended up doing: limited play time makes waiting for days to play because one's body and the graveyard are corpse-camped ridiculous. I made the same level in half the time. Granted, I knew which quests to pick up for clustering, and I'm rolling this druid slightly differently.</div></div><hr />

Try one of these (http://www.wow-pro.com/node/692).<br />

I like Jame's take on STV. There's like three times you go into STV. Low 30s, there's a few quests near Grom'Gul. You take the zepp from org, you run outside town, you kill some stuff, you run back. In and out. Then in the high 30s there's the Nesingwary quests in north STV. After that the next time you go back into STV is mid 40s. He keeps it very organized, very quick, there should be no grinding or dilly-dally in STV. You go in, grab a few hundred thousand xp, then get the hell out as fast as you can.<br />
<br />
Done this both horde and ally side with non-stealth classes (priest and pally). Druids should fare much better, as they have stealth as a base ability, and can disappear if they need.<br />
<br />
Don't fear STV. But don't live there either.</div></div><hr />

Can dps and tank instances and easily grind. You get mobs to half health before they even come out of stun, more hp than the other two specs and dont really have to wait for mana.</div></div><hr />
