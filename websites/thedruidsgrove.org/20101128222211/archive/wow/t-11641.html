<br />
Personally I think the 'healing' portion of durid healing is perfect.  It's the non-healing aspect I have cause for concern.  The other healing classes have some sort of agro-management ability that allows them to deal with any agro they might encounter....i.e.  priests have fade/bubble, pallies wear plate AND have a bubble, shammies have self-rez.  <br />
<br />
The only thing I think that is lacking from durid and ToL healing specifically is some sort of agro-reduction ability, or something to counteract a 5k hit.  If you somehow pull agro in a 10man Karazhan raid you're basically dead....there is just no time to shift from tree to bear, and when you're in bear nobody is getting healz.  I HAVE used that green watch you get from the quest out in Hellfire sooo many times it's sorta unbelieveable.<br />
<br />
What I'd LIKE to see is either a 'fade' ability, a self-cast only shield (like mages), a form of 'perma-barkskin'...although the dmg mitigation is pretty meh, orrrr.... tree form getting the same armor buff as bare &amp; oomkin :texla: <br />
<br />
opinions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mobs in heroics hit SO hard it's not funny and even with a sunder and sometimes 2, 2 regrowths that crit make the mob look at me and chop down this druidic tree :(<br />
<br />
Yes, I have the highest repair bills during any heroic.  Non-heroic no problem.  Heroic = Kyane goes broke from repair bills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Set up your form shifts as double tab changes so you can change directly to a form. Use cat form if you pull agro and run towards the mob and cower, thus pulling the mob towards the tank. <br />
<br />
If you are a Tauren use war stomp (Move towards the mob and help mitigate there damage by interupting it)! The number of times I see resto druids trying to heal thru damage!<br />
<br />
Bear form &gt; frenzy regen &gt; move towards tank &gt; bash<br />
<br />
I am also supprised at the lack of use of cyclone, try saving that for those situations.<br />

Bear in healing gear is about the same effect as Barkskin, but you can't heal while in it.  I never pull aggro with Salvation though, and I don't use Subtlety.  I can see where you could pull it without either, but with a sufficiently good tank, I still don't think you should be in too much trouble.<br />
<br />
You should learn to distinguish when its your fault as a healer for pulling aggro and when it's the fault of the tank.  There are plenty of lazy/not good tanks out there; don't go changing around your spec/gear/strategy just to overcompensate with people you should avoid grouping with anyway :p  I'm generally a pessimist when it comes to grouping with people I don't know lol.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for reminding me of the princess.  she's Hot.  brings back some good memories... late at night, alone in Mara with the princess...  I think i'll stealth back there tonight to say hi again</div></div><hr />

Being in an especially sadistic mood last week, I helped a friend in a Mechanar PUG: Me, shadow priest, resto druid, hunter, and a fire mage. <br />
<br />
The priest and hunter were trying to one-up each other on their stupid damage meters, so they kept pulling aggro off of me.  After almost every pull, one of them would check the damage meter (and then proceed to break my stones for coming in third and eventually fourth). They had little clue that the Big Bad Bear takes a beating so they don't have to. <br />
<br />
But, that's what I get for joining a PUG. <br />

Our hots have less hps and cost more mps than healing touch. The main TOL heal ends up being regrowth, which is quite poor in mps, assuming you have good +healing gear. If you include the global cooldown time, hots take 1.5 seconds of counts-toward-fsr-time to cast versus 3.0 seconds of not-in-fsr-time for healing touch, but they do less healing. And casting more often reduces your fsr ratio substantially.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can heal almost anything in TOL if you're a good player, but why would you want to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myraine</div><div class="date">04-01-2007, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently respeced from full tree form to a 27/0/34 build and I am loving it.  <br />
<br />
Not being able to decurse or use HT while in form was driving me nuts and I have had tree form since it was introduced but since BC has come out I have found it to be next to useless for me. Tree form should allow you to use all of your healing/curing abilities especially since in BC we are not part of a 40 man raid that has multiple healers and decursers to supliment our talents or failings.<br />
<br />
I often find myself as a main healer in 5 man groups and due to the above limitations I stopped using ToL all together.  There was just too much having to change forms mid fight just to decurse someone and when your tank is taking 5000 + damage per hit, you kinda need to use HT.  So I figured why have a bunch of talent points being wasted, hence the respec.  <br />
<br />
The interesting part is, I still have the healing talents that I mainly used as a full resto and a kick ass healing set.  I have not missed the extra points in resto at all in fact I think I am a better druid than ever.  I can solo like a fiend, I can dps in an instance when there is a priest or pally present while back up healing as needed, and I can still MH 5-man instances!  <br />
<br />
I hope Bliz takes a closer look at Tree Form and tweaks it in a good way.  They got Moonkin and Feral working well now they need to take a closer look at Restoration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently respecced out of ToL into a build extremely simlar to what you have there.<br />
<br />

<br />
It occured to me after reading a thread on Elitist Jerks, then realizing that:<br />
<br />
 Tree of life means I'm casting a ton of HoT's &amp; instant cast spells, all the time<br />
 This leads to me being inside the 5second rule, like all the time<br />
 Even though I have a ton of Spirit, it is doing me no good<br />
<br />
<br />
So I looked at what it would take to get to Dreamstate.<br />
Once I mapped it out, and mapped out the Resto talents I couldn't live without, I realized I could get some handy things like Moonkin (for soloing mostly), improved thorns (not huge, but I keep it on the tanks when raiding. It must be helping some.. right?), Insect Swarm (there really isn't another debuff like it).<br />
<br />
So far.. it's working for me. Even though it isn't really conventional.<br />
