I got a bunch of the hateful/deadly gear resil up to like 500 or something, and i was getting slaughtered. Plus it has horrible damage compared to my pve sets. <br />
<br />
currently i pve i have 3 feral sets, kitty, bear avoidance, and bear stamina. and i gotta say the bear stamina one is the most fun. <br />
<br />
With my bear stam set on i have 44k self buffed. I think this is better than the avoidance set because of stuns and spells. Let me just say though that this is fun. people hit me once, the alt tab and run away. I commonly run into packs of enemies by my self and they can't kill me. its great for spamming macros /laugh /dance.<br />
<br />
i highly recommend this if u guys wanna play around</div></div><hr />

I do have about 110 resilence, but thats hardly making a difference. Going from 32k to 39k does :)</div></div><hr />

I think it all depends on your team-setup.<br />
I play with a healer, so i need my DPS and more importanly my 49% crit!!<br />
Still i need to survive some burst damage vs dual-dd-teams. Thats why i choose my +res-gear. In my normal kitty-gear i get burned down twice as fast.<br />
I'm sitting on a constant rating between 1800-1900, so maybe in the higher ratings i will consider the max. hp-equip. But then the timing of all damage must be very good to burn your enemies down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still in mostly all Savage gear, except for my Hateful Shoulders, which i got by spending Emblems of Valor. I've run Vault week in, week out, since hitting 80 and have gotten NO PvP drop love...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on one of the oldest WoW-Servers with population always at max. so i dont know if u can do the same:<br />
On my server everytime alliance gets a hold of wintergrasp (on the evening) u find at least 5 groups who wanna do archavon.<br />
What i did was starting a fast raid myself. Right after the wintergrasp win open a raid and shout into general and lfg &quot;LFM fast archavon 25 run&quot;.<br />
Everytime i did that, i had about 50-70 whispers in 3 mins with ppl wanting to join.<br />
And now the most important part:<br />
I GET TO CHOOSE SO IM THE ONLY FERAL IN THERE!! :band: <br />
<br />
Got until now 1 deadly feral piece, 2 resto and 2 balance pieces.<br />
3 PvE T7.5 pieces. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, I am Alliance, and its a rare occasion that we don't have WG.  So, groups are a bit less prevalent.  But I suppose I could just do my own groups, but then again...I am lazy!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">o yea, i've been doing that... i've even set up a macro that goes something  like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;LFM for 25 Man Vault. please pst me with class and spec for inv. I don't want to stack too much of any class, so please don't take it personally if you don't get invited, thanks!&quot;<br />
<br />
It usually takes a couple of quick edits right after &quot;LF&quot; if i need another healer or tank, etc. but as soon as i hit that macro in /2 i get bombarded with &quot;inv please&quot; even though i specifically ask for class and spec. The most common offenders are huntards, of course... If i already have 3 or so of a certain class and get a tell from another one, i'll let them know that there are already 3 people of the same class running, and if they're ok with it, I'm ok with it.<br />
<br />
About 3 weeks ago, I started a group and it seriously just so happened that i was the only druid in the group. RIGHT after i filled, a boomkin asked if he could join... We ran Vault, and the T7.5 feral legs and resto gloves dropped, so that worked out for me pretty nicely. I have yet to see any Feral PvP gear drop though...<br />
<br />
I'm REALLY hoping it's not going to be another Terrestrian Strangle Staff debacle for me... I swear, I was already Exalted with the Violet Hold, after running Kara for about 9 months before that damn staff dropped for me... gah...<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I am getting fairly well known for runnign a balanced raid into Vault. I've seen a few of the same names week in and week out. It's really getting to the point where i'd much rather run Vault with my guild though, now that everyone in my guild has the dps for it... NO druids in my guild love PvP as much as i do, so if something drops, chances are they'd let me have it anyways... This past Tuesday was a guild run, and the holy pally on my team picked up the chest and gloves in one run... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-13-2009, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a similar experience when puging the fillers for Naxx-25, I usually get my pick of the litter!  Unfortunatley its usually those unqualified to run with their own guild or too annoying to be in a guild for any length of time.  Thankfully we have a pretty good list of &quot;regulars&quot; that fill in from outside of guild.<br />
<br />
So I have to ask, is there a mod that just tells you class/spec/stats of a person from the whisper window?  <br />
<br />
I would love to be able to see some basic players stats from just clicking that person's name in chat...is that possible?<br />
<br />
There seems to be a mod for everything these days.</div></div><hr />
