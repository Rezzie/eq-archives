<br />
I needed Oily blackmouths and Firefin Snappers so i went and fished them up myself. Every other raw fish i cought i used in cooking, My cooking skill at the moment is capped at 150. The good thing about cooking fish is you dont need anything else to cook it, just a fire which is free. <br />
<br />
The book to become expert fisherman is in Bootey Bay and costs 1 gold. Its on the bottom floor of the dock farthest away from where the boat comes. <br />
<br />
It is a good idea to always use the baits when fishing. It raises up your fishing skill so you can catch faster. And there is also a Strong Pole that is sold in limited supply by fishing supply vendors that has +5 fishing. The Aquadynamic Fish attractor made by engineers adds 100 to fishing skill for 5 minutes. There is also an enchant to fishing on gloves. I dont remember the exact amount at hte moment though.<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, when your waiting for your group to get to the instance, or the town, or your waiting for the guild to make a raid call, bust out that pole and catch some fish!!!!</div></div><hr />
