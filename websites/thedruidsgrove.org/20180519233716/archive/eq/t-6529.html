<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinsi</div><div class="date">02-02-2004, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Hmm&quot;, I thought. &quot;Maybe I should do epic, just for the hell of it. Give me something to do on those afk-not-really-online&quot;-days. Yea. Good plan!&quot;<br />
<br />
So to start off, I figure I'll re-visit Kedge. I get lost like 15 times on the way to the seahorses, but tsk, innate camo really made moving around that zone trivial. Some named druid mob saw invis on the way, but she gave her life for that bit of aggression she showed. Located seahorses. Seahorse1 nuke nuke die. Seahorse2 nuke nuke die. Seahorse3 nuke nuke die. (Rinse, repeat.) Hmm, out of seahorses?<br />
<br />
Observation1: I remember there as being a -ton- of PHs in Kedge. It's like 8. OK, so I get to afk for 5mins after each clearing. Amazing how much housework can be done in 5minute intervals. All is good.<br />
<br />
3 clearings later. Pop tainted. And even better, he poped as the last mob on my PH-clearing, so I don't have to deal with dumb adds. Life is good. I'm preparing to leave Kedge, planning on hitting OOT next.<br />
<br />
Nuke, nuke. Summoned. Hmm, didn't remember tainted seahorse summoned, but no biggie. Nuke, Nuke. And then the fekker complete heals. Start again.. Nuke, Nuke (etc) Dead tainted. Pop corrupted. Nuke nuke nuke. Nuketinuke. And then he complete heals too. Lame cleric mobs. I hate them. Nuke, nuke. Getting bored here... Die, dammit, die! <br />
<br />
He's at 40, I'm hovering around 70% seing no real reason to waste mana on healing until..<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED.<br />
<br />
Ah bite me, you pos firewall! Of course it chose to crash right at this opportune moments. I don't mind dying, I mind having to waste 15min to get back to where I was. I'm not a happy camper.<br />
<br />
Run back from Butcher, swim down in the water in DC. Realize that without gear I have no EB. Run up on land. Cast EB, swim down again. Get lost 15 times AGAIN on the way to corpse. Locate corpse. Drag to safe spot. Loot. Med. Curse the firewall.<br />
<br />
By this time all PHs have repoped, so I get to clear some of them again before tackling the corrupted. Right as this is done, corrupted depops.<br />
<br />
Bite me again, you pos game. I am less than pleased, and I take it out on a few innocent place holders. New tainted pops fairly fast. Nuke nuke nuketi CH nuke nuke nuke die. Corrupted nuke nuke nuketinuke, ch, nuke, nuke. He's at 6%, I'm aruond 90. Firing last nuke..<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED!<br />
<br />
Ah f this!! We are not amused at this point. No sir, not at all amused. Log back on. Realize I'm still in Kedge. Be somewhat pleased that at least the game decided to kick me before the dumb thing CHed again and sent me back to bind. Look around for corrupted-corpse. Realize it's not there, since (/slam head in key board) I killed it while LD.<br />
<br />
Observation2: Kedge Keep hates me.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't really remember why I decided to get this dumb scimmy. And of course, eqclient.exe crashed while I was cursing in guildchat, so here I am, taking it out on you instead.</div></div><hr />

Did you DC as well?<br />

Why don't you try some of the easier ones first tho? Or at least on days like that, give up on Kedge.<br />
<br />
Btw, I would suggest NOT doing this unless you have at least 15 slots free in your bank to hold the quest gear...=P</div></div><hr />

hmm, KK isn't exactly -hard-, silly elfthing :P Just annoying when the firewall from hell gets me deaded, thatsall.<br />

1 semi-active soloing day netted me everything except Kedge (GRRRR), oot, LoIO, Frog, Fay and VSR stone (And that's only cause VSR wasn't up (btw, to duo real VS w/a druid/pally team you need REAL luck with slay undead &lt;-- lesson2 of the day)) Pity my bank, pity it a lot!<br />
<br />
Kedge-hell nonwithstanding, all in all not as bad as I thought it'd be. Is Froggy still 100%MR or do I stand a chance of soloing him now?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I r dumb.</div></div><hr />

I had a monk tanking him when I got mine and that was quite a while back.  Get your pally friend and go kill him.  Should be a cakewalk.  It's a 1 minute fight if he's up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barkrubber</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ulump has a pretty high regen and is fairly resistant.  With all fire debuffs ticking on him you might be able to use your fire based dots and the Ldon dot (unsure).  I tried to pincusion him a bit ago and his regen beats pincushioning.  He is the hardest thing for a druid to do solo in the quest for your epic.  You might be able to dc somethign in the swamp and have it dual wielding/hasted a Diz shillegh for slow, and maybe a tash stick to make him trivial.. then tank/pincushion him while the pet attacks and softens him up for you.<br />
<br />
If you can kill him fay is pretty easy solo.  Just hand the turn in (after all your buffs are in order) then run high up on the north west canyon wall and find a flat area to wall yourself against (scout first.. it helps)  land a few debuffs and horse up.. just pace back and forth a few times to get fay all the way up on the wall and then walk over and sit on him (belly dragon).  He dosen't hit too hard, and with all defensive aa's he should be cake.</div></div><hr />
