Feragho liked innervate and MF-spam, Rubix liked bear. Both were 31 resto as all other druid builds was worthless at the time.</div></div><hr />

I tried Balanced and have yet to try Resto.  I like the fact that Feral Spec allows you to have 3 fairly effective roles...Roguelike DPS/Stealth, Warriorlike Tanking ability and great healing ability if you have the right gear to switch into when raiding with the guild and u have to play priest.</div></div><hr />

Feragho/Conquix Video - might be worth going to warcraftmovies and getting a better copy, definatly the best produced druid pvp video I've seen.<br />
<br />
http://warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=1424<br />
<br />
This is Rubix's Force of Nature, his claim to druid fame.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both of these are pre-1.8</div></div><hr />

But the Night Elf &quot;Spoh&quot; is a very good druid who uses the hybrid to it full advantage.<br />
<br />
He also teams up with a hunter named &quot;Rick&quot; - and that infamous duo is also very impressive.<br />
<br />
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1124193408787700878&amp;q=Spoh<br />
<br />
He also has a new video called Unique thats on warcraftmovies - check that out as well.<br />

Peace<br />

That is the coolest thing ive ever seen.  He owned every class there is several times and did it all in the resto talent line. im going to have to rethink my specs for BC.  thanks for posting that video Rockwell, now i have something to aspire towards lol. the way he plays his druid is amazing, when i duel or pvp i almost never shapeshift out of cat form.  Now after reading some of the posts in this forum i have to rethink what ive been doing with my life lol. Thx again!</div></div><hr />

Learned a lot from those 2 vids =D (they were posted on WoWDruidForums a while back)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably the closest current &quot;legend&quot; that relies on outlasting the opponent, is Azgaz with the &quot;Nerf Druids&quot; series. Azgaz uses the pretty common 30/21 and 1/29/21 builds. (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/viewauthor.php?id=2299)<br />
<br />
If you prefer a full feral spec, the guy behind &quot;Druid of the Claw&quot; series is my favourite -- he plays his druid really  agressive, and it's a joy to watch if you're into feral stuff. :) (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=24394 is the fourth one in the siries -- the others can be found via the search function on that page.)<br />
<br />
Both of these druids are well-known both amongst druids and outside the druid community. Dunno if I'd call them legends though...</div></div><hr />
