<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saffun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So since the planes are being opened up please list good advise here to help us tier 1 newbies out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps. keep flames limited, my guild has alot of paladins and we really started to grind alot on undead in COD. So we know too the pains of losing hunting spots that are not crowded. However since i am gimp myself ill see alot of zones that only some of my elder brethren have seen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saffun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Opps i was one of those druids that stayed 60 forever because i quit once a year for 6 months. <br />
<br />
<br />
Im a 62 druid about to turn 63 with two spells our 63 dot and new heal spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ellzii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get a slower a rezzer (Cleric prefered Paladin if you are totally destitute) and a tank. Holy trinity rules still apply in the planes With slow being more essential.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ccLothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good start on spells.  That 63 heal is nice.  Use that and TR as your healing one, two punch.  Groups in PoP need a slower, tank, and usually crowd control plus random other.  You can be the healer or an other.  If you are the healer, start your CHs really early(like 75%), until the mob is slowed.  This of course depends on what class and how good your tank is.  As far as surviving, play and have fun.  Most mobs run, so remember to snare.  A horse would be a good thing.  When you do zone into PoV invis up and run around.  Load the map and learn it, and where all the camps are.  If you get a choice, Inner Cave is the best XP in the zone.  Try really hard not to get agro.  Stuff in this zone can remove 1k hipoints in a blink.  Just use your standard grouping instincts and you'll do fine.  <br />
<br />
P.S.  Most of the ubers have moved on to other zones; and don't let the people you do find intimidate you.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Usually depends on the Plane.<br />
<br />
Please note that if the holy trinity isn't mentioned, they will still apply.<br />
<br />
Valor:<br />
Can holy trinity, aggro kite, charm tank, ping-pong ... It's DL, KC and Velks all rolled into one.<br />
<br />
Storms:<br />
Same as Valor.  Kiters are limited to forest frogs.  Holy trinity for everything else on account of summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
Torment:<br />
Don't go there.  Just ... DON'T.  If you don't go crazy from the static comming out of your speakers ... Saryn will find some other way.<br />
<br />
CoD:<br />
Standard Holy Trinity.<br />
Charmed tankers + rangers/nukers (non-melee) groups are possible<br />
<br />
Bastion of Thunder:<br />
Holy Trinity for melee type giants (summoners)<br />
Can aggro kite elementals and casters as they don't summon<br />
<br />
HoH:<br />
Kiters paradise.  Aggro kiting snareables.  Ping-pong unsnareables.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just go, my son, go and live in the free air of the tier 2+ planes.  They are boring as heck but they will give you better exp rates than anything you dream of in PoN/PoD.<br />
<br />
Just don't train the afk room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tilien Venator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HoH is basically a solo'rs paradise. Hardly ever saw groups there for long. The RvR is pretty weak for groups.<br />
<br />
Not bad though for solo'ing. I made about 100aap there back in the day.<br />
<br />
As for the un-snareables. Just load up your stun spells. They are fast enough casting that you can easily kite them. Oh ya, also make sure to refresh your SoE BEFORE starting. Died a few times when I forgot that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Voronus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can i just ask, what is Holy Trinity. That has really been bugging me reading this thread. Probably something stupid that i cant think of. Please enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Onetree Tallbarque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tils, that maps identifies the &quot;5 stones&quot; incorrectly. From left to right they should be: unused, Plane of Valor, Tower of Sol Ro, Halls of Honor, and Plane of Tactics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Unfortunatly thats the only one i could find which was ok lol..all the rest are well crap.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>buzweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Great info. Kin, they will keep some folks from on their toes and probably save a few lives, including my own, LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tubben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Slower / Tank / Healer - Holy Trinity.<br />
Can kill allmost everything with that combo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vermilion Starfires</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have done Storms and Valor with no slower except an Epic Ranger, not the best way but definately doable.  Any Competant cleric, druid, shaman can heal sufficiently for non named mobs.  My &quot;normal&quot; PoS/V group is<br />
<br />
61 Paladin<br />
61 Ranger<br />
63 Druid<br />
63 Rogue<br />
62 Shaman<br />
62 Paladin<br />
<br />
We do just fine, root and druid charm are our only CC and it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SilleyEskimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Best group I ever had for CoD was:<br />
<br />
3 Pallies with Slay Undead<br />
2 Druids with DC pets<br />
Necro<br />
<br />
It was sick.  Sick I tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thandril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That's one of the things that really annoys me lately. Those non standard groups do work in the right location and they often work better than a more standard arrangement.<br />

The problem? Too many people are just too inflexable to even try!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the most part they already do, at least in my guild.  PoFire and PoEarth are the best exp in the game and the named actually drop good loot (gasp!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>sudawilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Same here Za Arain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm... I'm almost scared to think how many people are going to be camping those planes now, training, and CRing all day long.  It was nice to have at least some limit on who could go there for a while.  I got access to CoD, Tactics, and most of BoT solo.  PoV and POS are easy enough with a pickup group. I worked hard to get those flags, and now they're giving them away, and the planes will be swamped.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some will flame me for this, but I don't like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>sudawilde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Alot of people dont like it,  but it really is a trend with VI and it had to be expected...  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>buzweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I can see why people are upset, Frogs in Storm were prized Solo MOBs, they are giving about 2% less exp. Not sure how badly this will effect Parchment drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>buzweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Is HoH worth soloing? I tried it out on a light blue and ensnare was resited, is it worth soloing there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Oh dear, it's happened.....  BoT turned into a newbie zone yesterday.  People shouting all sorts of crap you used to see in West Commons, trains everywhere, and camp checks???<br />
<br />
The frogs in POS give less XP now, AND there are tons more people trying to get to them.<br />
<br />
Good spots in HoH, or PoV are also being over run....<br />
<br />
Now what?  Where do those of us go, who just want to do some quiet solo hunting?<br />
<br />
I don't think the flag change was a good idea.  You could access all of the planes that were opened by gathering a normal pickup group, and it didn't take all that long.  Those that wanted to get there, could!</div></div><hr />
