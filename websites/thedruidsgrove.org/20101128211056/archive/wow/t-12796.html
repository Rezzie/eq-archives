Gruul's is such a long fight, that I feel I really should be power-shifting to help boost my damage output.<br />
<br />
At what point in the &quot;Shred-to-5CP&quot;--&gt;Rip cycle should I powershift?  How much (really how little) energy should I have before I should consider power-shifting?  Less than 15?<br />
<br />
We had a bear tanking Gruul, so I didn't have to waste energy keeping the Mangle debuff on Gruul.  And, raid buffed, I had 45+% crit.  So, I would often reach 5 CP well before the previous Rip had finished its cycle.  I assume the best course of action is to continuing Shredding until Rip expires (or just before it expires), correct?<br />
<br />
Also, I picked up 2T4 this weekend, does the 2 piece bonus effect generate any sort of UI notification when it occurs?  Just wondering....</div></div><hr />

I use Scrolling Combat Text and it's pretty obvious to me when I proc the T4 bonus.</div></div><hr />

Other proc based effects (idol of terror) show up in the stock combat text.  Wonder why this one doesn't.  Looking back at my recount data, I do see that the effect is called &quot;Bloodlust&quot;.  Maybe it was there and I didn't see it.</div></div><hr />

The timing needs to be really exact for you to get any real benefit from it, and what with latency and so many other considerations in a raid environment, such as your party's health bars, I've just found it a distraction and a waste of mana more than anything else.<br />
<br />
I just don't feel like it's worth it for what is really a very small dmg increase.<br />
<br />
With that said I do know some druids like to powershift, so if someone wants to provide an opposition argument to bring to this debate I would be very interested to hear what you have to say :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">09-02-2008, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a raid situation, and when one has most of their moves down to rote, power shifting provides mathmetician's the ability to see their DPS increase, or those who are bored a bit of interaction.<br />
<br />
Yes you get a positive result DPS-wise if you trade Mana for Energy efficiently.<br />
<br />
That said, I would hope that a well-oiled team would not need anyone to perform this maneuver unerringly to be victorious or to justify a spot in the raid for Kitty DPS. I'm a bit OCD so I think I'd do it out of boredom eventually. But I'd prefer not to.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the real charm of powershifting is for movement impairing effects or to get off a rip / ferocious bite when energy is below 20. There's actually a macro, I believe on Elitist Jerks, that let's you establish an energy threshold and then exectue a script. Then when energy hits a certain floor and your mana hasn't gone below a threshold as well, it will automatically powershift. And I believe it has a coefficient for lag built-in as well. I'll poke around for it again, I really not into that level of automation...yet.</div></div><hr />

The real trick is to manage your mana like a caster so you can powershift the entire duration of the fight.  It's hella fun.  Insta mana-pot macro ftw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-03-2008, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That macro sounds pretty cool.  I'd be interested to take a look at that, if you do manage to find it :&gt;<br />
