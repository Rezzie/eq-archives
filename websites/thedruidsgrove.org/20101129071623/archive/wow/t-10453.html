Yo I saw you too! Was good times and I got lucky being paired up with Kane's crew, otherwise I usually get mopped up quick in WSG =/. WSG is slowly growing on me, mostly because I get into some of the premades matches by sheer luck. Otherwise the pug wsg matches are usually me getting slaughtered vs. VoW/Paragon/Gorrs crew....can't even get outta the fr without getting destroyed by 3-4 rogues and double paladin stuns lol.</div></div><hr />

Kane licked me good a few times.  He has quite the rep on the Alliance side.  When PuGs see his crew it is usually &quot;sit down, this will be over quickly&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let's see, as I run from the FR I get frost shock, frost shock, mind flay, scatter shot, charge stun and shortly after that sweet death.  <br />

A lot of the well respected Ally PvPers on Malfurion were hitting BGs hard this weekend, having a group of 10 premade and just jumping between AB and WSG.  This weekend was the first time I've won WSG since I was in my 20s!  AB too, but that was mainly due to a lack of Horde players once and a slow trickling of hordies the 2nd time.  <br />
<br />
It was funny to tell people in the raid chat &quot;hey, I know that Stugots guy!&quot; to which they usually responded &quot;Then you should enjoy killing him that much more&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
Hopefully, we'll see more of each other this coming weekend. :)</div></div><hr />

I like the PvP sets but in all honesty I don't have the time to grind to 12-14.</div></div><hr />
