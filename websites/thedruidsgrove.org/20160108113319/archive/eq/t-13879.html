<br />
Personally i only view authentic magelo cause there are just too many &quot;WISH LIST&quot; druids on there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">05-15-2006, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you need to pay for eqrankings syncing to get the autentic symbol next to your name on rankings?<br />
 <br />
And ethierway, I filter it by any.  High end people usually don't make fake magelos (although you get a 480 hp drachnid candle here and there.)  <br />
 <br />
However, technically my magelo is fake ;D.  You cannot add 'epic 2.5' augment to standard magelo so I boosted my ldon stone by 30% to show the extra hp / mana I have in game from 2.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">05-15-2006, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct Kamion, you need to pay for auto syncing to get that icon next to your name. And that icon is ONLY on people that pay for autosync, and not for premium magelo. So Kinyenya has been &quot;ranking&quot; himself or herself with auto-sync people and not necesarily with premium magelos :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinyenya</div><div class="date">05-15-2006, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye Nimchip, i look for the authentic symbol next to the names.  I mean it only cost me an extra $2.97 for a year or lifetime whatever it was to get it autosyned so to me was worth it.  Considering when i look under authentics i rank in the top 15 overall but when viewed by all its like top 50.  Then when i go to look up some of those top druids on Saryrn server they havent existed in years and are retired or never existed or one i actually looked up was really level 5 trader mule but on eqrankings was in the top 20.<br />

Oh ya and its she:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">05-16-2006, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea but what Kamion is saying is that EQRankings' Autosync isn't the same as Premium magelo. So you can have Autosync players without premium (maybe made up) magelos and vice versa. So it's not really a good idea nor an accurate one to rank with Autosync in mind.</div></div><hr />

I've moved up to 44, I'm very happy to be in the top 50 only raiding 3 days a week. Soon I shall be bumping druids on Saryrn down a few notches. =)<br />

I have a symbol next to my name. I had it there only for a short time after autosyncing was live, then it went away. Last week noticed it on one of my alt, but not on mine. Now its on mine. So no clue whats getting it there.  Either way I look at all druids.</div></div><hr />

I see, that's interesting.<br />

Maybe some sort of bug on their part.</div></div><hr />
