I've talked to the ogre in Lower City (by the reagent vendor) and on the tower at the arena in Blade's Edge. I got the three group quests from him, but can't get the Ogre Heaven quest to go to Ogri'la to talk to Chu'a'lor (http://thottbot.com/q11009). Do I have to do the group quests before I can get Ogre Heaven? It doesn't say so on Thottbot. Or am I missing something else?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">07-31-2007, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you have to do all the group quests before getting the quest to unlock the Ogri'la daily quests.<br />
<br />
And it's like 9 or so...not just 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do the skygaurd quests till freindly, then take the skygaurd to the same area of blades edge, once that is done your faction is tied together, when you complete the skygaurd quests it also gives you rep for the Ogri'la guys.<br />
<br />
so far i have pulld about 50 shards per day in just quests<br />
<br />
so far trying to find a group to do the group quests has been a serious pain in the arse on my server (dark iron)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">07-31-2007, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are skyguard quests that are independent of the Ogri'la quests, but in the same area.  There are only 2 or 3 Ogre quests as I recall.<br />
<br />
After you do you 3 ( kill this ogre, then that one ) you then have 2 more group quests ( one is a 5 man requirement ).   Then once you have turned those in and are dubbed King/Queen of the Ogres, you can proceed to Ogri'la.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weaselking1973</div><div class="date">08-01-2007, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you must be talking about the inital ogre quest that starts in shat and send you to blades edge area to get quests from him.<br />
<br />
not sure if thats even part of the chain or not, but i had done those a while before ever flapping my wings to Ogri'la and doing quests there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">08-01-2007, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the Ogri'la quests open based on your Reputation level.<br />
<br />
Fastest way to do it is to kill all the Sons of Gruul. After finishing the chain you can automatically get the &quot;The Apex Resonation&quot; or something like that once you're Friendly with Ogri'la.<br />
<br />
Quick side note....the items from killing the Sons Of Gruul can be looted by anyone who has the quest. You don't have to be in the killing party to loot it.<br />
<br />
It might be worth your time to check and see if anyone else is killing the sons and just tag along.<br />
<br />
When I did the quests initially, there were 2 other groups killing as well so we just took turns racing to the next objective and smashing the buggers.<br />
<br />
Then once you hit Honored with Ogri'la you unlock the &quot;Banish Demons&quot; quest with can get you the Crystalforged Darkrune which is used in the Shartuul Event that can get you a Depleted Badge.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">08-01-2007, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's really weird.....I had 2 full groups loot it and it was still there.  This was right after initial release of the area, maybe it was changed in a subsequent patch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">08-02-2007, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks again for all the responses. I can now verify what you all posted, because my guild went through the Sons of Gruul quests, I went back to Ogri'la, and the quests started opening up. There's actually quite a lot to do there, including all the Shatari Skygard stuff.<br />
<br />
Last night I was wandering around with my priestess buddy trying to find the link to buy one of those vials for the questgiver's son, and I found a clickable tooltip in one of the Forge Camps. So I clicked on it, gave it my 35 apexis shards and BAM:newburn: this huge 72 elite spawns and starts pounding on me! I popped into bear form and the priest was healing me up and we were holding our own, but she would clearly run out of mana before he died. This nice wandering rogue offered to help, I invited him and we killed the big brute! Since he was so nice to help I let him roll on the apexis crystal, and of course he won it :confused: , but at least we didn't die and I learned my lesson (again) about clicking on things I don't know about :dance:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">08-23-2007, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, now that I've farmed Apexis Shards and accumulated almost 800 of them, I'm ready to try Shartuul. I read up on it in WowWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Shartuul's_Transporter_(event)) and it sounds really complicated. Does anybody have any advice on this event? Is it as hard as it sounds? Should I just recruit a group and let them help me, or would that help much? The hp listed on the strategy sounds obscene! I would appreciate any help I can get here.</div></div><hr />

http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32602#comments<br />
<br />
Check here for a nice rundown of the encounter.<br />
<br />
I have 1 Crystalforged Darkrune, 1 Darkrune (they're both unique) and a Grab Bag that contains a Darkrune (I'm guessing as I can't open it yet...the game won't let me.) in the bank right now with 1500 Shards in there too.<br />
<br />
I'm scared to try the event as I've never been able to get past the Doomguard stage after 6 attempts.<br />
<br />
I'm tempted to have someone in my guild play my character to finish these events for me...cause I want that friggin badge dang it.</div></div><hr />
