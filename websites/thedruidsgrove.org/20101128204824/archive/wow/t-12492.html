<br />
Now it could be that Omen just isn't reading properly yet, but  I've ended up normal fights in normal instances with like 15k threat leads.... that seems almost excessive given how short some of those mobs live when you smack them around with some level 70s.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed this?</div></div><hr />

It's not just on mechanicals and undead either; I have to scale back my threat on some encounters to avoid overtaking the MT.<br />
<br />
And it's not just omen either; omen is being pretty accurate in showing when I'd get aggro and actually having me get aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the change was kinda funny, because I've never met a feral tank who had threat problems anyway!  Gotta love Blizzard for constantly trying to make PvE easier and easier!!! ... (not.)<br />
<br />
Imagine if they had actually changed Swipe so it didn't break CC.  I mean, it isn't bad enough that idiots can get to level 70 by mashing five buttons ... now we're going to let them tank successfully at level 70, too?  Come on, Blizzard ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">04-01-2008, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The increase in threat is largely due to the increased periodic damage of Lacerate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lacerate has 2 components.  The first is a tiny bit of direct damage, and it is this part that contains the threat payload.  There is also the periodic bleed effect which does not (as far as I can tell) add any extra threat beyond what that amount of damage would generate anyway.<br />
<br />
If you have 5 stacks of Lacerate ticking all the time you can expect quite a lot more aggro now, because with 5 stacks the amount of damage it churns out is really quite considerable.<br />

<br />
i still laugh when they dont and get 1 shotted :p<br />
<br />
i just wish they would all use omen - then they might understand and save themselves a death :o</div></div><hr />

WFT) my threat generation was through the roof.  Normally I can't keep pace with a warrior.  This time, it was no sweat.  I was keeping pace the same as a warrior and giving the DPS a HUGE ceiling.</div></div><hr />
