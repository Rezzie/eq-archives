I am 36% into 55, and at my current spot, I can grind about 5-8 % a KEI, which i guess ill live with till 56.....<br />

I must have the record, the record of most levels(and time) spent in Dreadlands, I have been there since level 35, and now I am 55, lol, I must have the record. <br />

<br />
Not sure if you know, light blue mobs only give half of whatever XP their level would indicate.  You should be killing only dark blue (or higher) mobs when soloing.<br />
<br />
ME is good, Chardok, Scarlet Desert up on the Plateau.  The Grey if you learn to handle the traps.  If you're pursuing the shawl quests, Frenzy in Velks, or Geonid caves in WL (XP, loot, and quest drops =)<br />
<br />
You don't mention if you have all expansions, or any sense of what equipment you have.  My two biggest recommendations, regardless of XP style (quad, rot, charm, grouping, etc) are get a horse, and get an MP3 focus item.  They will help you a LOT no matter how you hunt.<br />

Now, on to your other questions, yes, I know light blues give alot less exp then dark blue(gimmi some place to kill DBs) And yes, DL has VERY few, but SOME, Dark blues, with track I can get a few, but mostly I just quad around about 12 Lightblues at a time, but a dark blue is nice to find :) <br />
<br />
I am saving up for a Obulus death shroud(MP3 plus better stats then BCP) and do you think a horse is worth it??? I dont like the idea of the slow/start slow/stop thing, I heard, if you turn off all the luclin graphics or something you dont get to see the horse, but you also dont have the slow start/stop thing, true? Or is the slowing down/up not a big deal?<br />
<br />
Hehe, thanks for all the suggestions</div></div><hr />

after that try grouping, i didn't read all of your first post, so i don't know if you hate groupin or whatnot, however, go to velks. The exp isn't the best, however, you should be able to find a group readily there, and the loot is quite nice...if you get a good camp you can expect a few k in gems/items in 4-5 hours...<br />

<br />
As to Elysians, if you are after FAST xp, they are definitely not the way to go.  XP will be very slow compared to almost any other camp mentioned here.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, regarding the horse:  I've never had Luclin models on since I've had the horse, and I love it!!  No stop/start hesitation, and I can still duck out of spells.  Absolutely, positively the best 8kpp any druid can spend in EQ.<br />

That zone stops giving decent exp at like 48.  And with all the roamers, its not one I'd really rank as easy.  Its a PIA, IMO.<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye is almost the same, but much much much better exp.  Really,  you need to try it.  Whenever you learn a new zone, there is a learning curve, where you exp gain might not  appear to be improved.  But, ME is not very  difficult to learn and provides a lot of opportunities for trying really all of the soloing techniques that druids can use (once you become faimilar with that zone).  Also, on my server its pretty much empty, which is nice for me.<br />
<br />
All that being said, most folks I know skip all that and solo in Nightmare now.<br />
<br />
But..DL...man, that has got to be the most inefficient way of trying to level at 55 that there is.  LET IT GO.   DL IS OVER!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I want to, :D <br />
<br />
So Tat, horse no start stop with models off? Grrrrrreat. <br />
<br />
Just to be safe, since I have never charm kited in my life(other then a few crocs and caimans in Oasis in my teens.) What spells should I be using? :)  <br />
<br />
If anyone could either tell me here, or post a link to a good guide for ME, that would be cool, I really like Root DoTing so I may just root dot the wolves if they are ok exp. <br />
<br />
Hey Tat, also, do you still get the mana regen of the horse and no aggro even tho you dont appear to be on the horse?<br />
<br />
as of now, I am 36% through level 55. <br />
<br />
Please lemmi know what are things to do, and things NOT to do :)  and anything else that is helpful, like the spell lineup as I said earlier. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help, once I get back to my moms it sounds like ME time(lol get the pun?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Hey Tat, also, do you still get the mana regen of the horse and no aggro even tho you dont appear to be on the horse?&quot;<br />
<br />
As to the mana regen, why on Earth would I have the horse if I didn't get the mana regen =)  ???  As long as you are not  moving or in auto-attack (and as a Druid, why would you be in auto-attack ;)  on the &quot;tick&quot;, you get the extra &quot;sit/med&quot; mana regen (an extra 20/tick with maxed meditate skill).<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean by &quot;no aggro&quot;?  Being on a horse doesn't change your faction anywhere that I know of.  If you mean, does it still keep you from getting &quot;sit aggro&quot; when swapping spells, then yes.<br />
<br />
As to &quot;appearing&quot; to be on a horse, well that's PC dependent.  &gt;I&lt; have models turned off, so I don't see me being on a horse, but if you have models on, you do see me being on a horse.  Fortunately, SoE requires all mobs to keep Luclin models on =) !!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<br />
With horses, have you had any problems with them tat? I mean like miss selecting and stuff? Or not a issue with Models off? oh and one more thing, with models off, can you SoE yourself and get all the benefits? IE, sow speed(not 10%horsey) and levitate??<br />
<br />
Cause that is a big thing for me. If i could have all the benefits of SoE While I have a horse's mana regen :)  that would be sweet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">01-27-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, all benefits of SoE.<br />
<br />
As to selecting and such, I'm normally in 3rd person view, so I don't usually run into the &quot;clicking on the invisible neck of your horse&quot; thingy.  But it does happen on occasion.  However, the mana regen is a big enough benefit to learn to live with whatever downside there may be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tawnosii</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With 199 wis i think you definitely need to do elysians at least until you get the tunic, crown, and legs.  You should get some other pieces by then also.  The horse is really key for elysians as with rotting anything.  Because at 55 elysians will break root constantly, i would also suggest getting the warden symbol of tunare if you can.  With it, you can chain cast root while still getting med benefits on the horse.  After that, I would suggest raptors at 55 and 56.  All are still blue at 55 and only a few go lightblue at 56.  You can either charm them (disposable pets) or quad them.  <br />
Most of the explanations of charm tactics i've read are for 58+ charming (ie after TR).  For raptors, the only thing you need to do is snare, charm, set them on other raptors, and break charm with camouflage when your pet is low on hp to kill it.  The same would apply to ravenous nighstalker in pon also i would imagine.  The key is that you need a steady stream of charmable animals without any that are too high for your charm spell.  This makes blood ravens in pon and rats in pod impractical.  I think it would also make ravenous beasts in ME a bad idea.  Once you get TR at 58 you can start keeping your pets around effectively and then can start looking at pets that might be too high for charm.<br />
The other spot i used when raptors was taken was toilers, but with only 199 wis i doubt you could finish a quad.  With 255 wis at level 57, toilers become a better option.  By that time, a good number of the raptors are lightblue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolodo</div><div class="date">01-28-2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It takes about 15-20 mins to root/rot Elysians.  Yes they break root but just reroot.  I started hunting these at lvl 53 and the druid armor can't be beat.  I have a full set and all the druids in my guild also have a full set.  <br />
<br />
At level 55 you will find red, yellow and even cons.  I was getting a full blue and more taking down reds.  You will easily hit level 56 with the added benifit of upgrading your equipment.  I am amazed at the difference the Elysian armor has made from ac to resists.<br />
<br />
I then hunted in Sebilis until I hit level 58.  Once I got Fist of Karana, I went to Colbalt Scar and started quadding the &quot;gift that keeps on giving&quot; otters.  At level 58 I am getting almost a full blue per quad.  Not only is the exp good, my bank account is getting very fat from these otters.  When PoP came out, you will be amazed at how available the otter camps are.  I am currently at level 59 and very soon will be 60.  After that I can't help you with any suggestions.<br />

I also wanted to second charm soloing in ME and especially in Chardok.  Using Call of Karana, I would charm a Sniffer and I would be able to hold Iz along with pulling some fort mobs if it isn't camped.<br />
<br />
This leads back into getting Elysian armor.  When I was charm soloing in Chardok before I got Elysian or ME, I died alot and became discouraged with charming.  Once I was outfitted in Elysian I tried Chardok again and the equipment made all the difference in the world.  I no longer die when charm soloing in Chardok thus more exp with no downtime.<br />

Go east a short distance to the zone wall, then head south for another short run.  There will be a tunnel in the zone wall that leads to Maiden's Eye.  <br />
From the zonein to maiden, camo and run east.  There will be a large stone enclosure with xi's (guys in black robes).  Go around it and don't get too close.  Look out for wandering xi's nearby, and con them to make sure they don't see invis.  Go east until you hit the zone wall, then follow it south.  There will be another cave in the wall, and this one leads to umbral.  At the entrance to the cave will be 3 xi's.  If any of these see invis (check by conning) you may have to be adventurous.  Otherwise, run right past them.  If one does see invis, you can try to run past anyway, but some of the xi's are sk's and will harmtouch you, which would be bad.  Otherwise, you can try to pull the one out that sees invis and kite it around, but the xi's cast and the nearby area is usually filled with unpleasant things.<br />
Once you zone into umbral, make sure you remain camouflaged, and turn right when you leave the cave at zonein.  Follow this wall around until you get to a temple with stone guardians outside it.  Skirt around this temple (the guardians don't see invis) and stick to the wall afterwards.  The only things that see invis along this path are dark stalkers (more guys in robes) and they only rarely see invis.  Once you pass the temple and follow the zone wall, you will reach a corner shortly.  This is the safe valley to which you will pull elysians.<br />

Actually, when you port into DSP, have lev or SoE up, invis after you port in, and just run straight ahead.  Don't touch the left or right keys.  When you port into DSP, you are lined up facing EXACTLY at the ME zone tunnel =)<br />
