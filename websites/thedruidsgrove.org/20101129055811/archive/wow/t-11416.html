Anyone know great locations to farm Post 2.0? Tyr's Hand seems alright and pretty quick killing, BRD Pyromaster is pretty good too, But I'm always looking for something better. Population in farming areas isn't a problem for me cause I'm on a low population server and always love to pick fights with the alliance. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

I personally, picked up herbalism to go with enchanting after getting bored with leatherworking, just so I could farm for my epic mount easier. <br />
<br />
In any case, what I do with herbalism is go to Un'Goro crater. There, I run around randomly and without ever having a certain direction. Here are what I look for in that place:<br />
<br />
<br />
1: First and foremost, dreamfoil. Sells for alot. 265 herbalism required I think, somewhere around there.<br />
2: Killing Stone Guardians. (The 60-61 elites roaming Un'Goro). They are very easy to find, as noone bothers to kill them, and most of them don't seem to be able to kill them solo, possibly simply because they believe they can't. But as a druid, especially with warlord gear, you should be able to kill them easy enough. The Stone Guardians drop nice loot, sometimes elemental earth, and with a 25% chance of Guardian Stones. Each stone sells for about 4g on my server.<br />
3: If I am having problems finding any of the above two, I go to Fire Plume Ridge and kill the fire eles there for awhile for Essence/Heart of Fire.<br />
4: And last, I pick up any other herbs I pass by.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure on this, but based on the fact that your server is a low-population server I'm guessing that things like Dark Iron Scraps still sell for alot on that server? On mine the price has lowered some albeit they're still worth a fair bit of cash. If the price for them is still high, go solo as much of BRD as you can. They often drop Dark Iron Scraps, and you make alot quickly by soloing.</div></div><hr />

I've never farmed much myself, but a friend of mine managed to grind for his epic mount within 3 or 4 days. What he did was he abused his professions first, meaning if he had herbalism he got as many as I cared to get and sold them. He said he also farmed elementals in Silithus. That's just what he did, though. I think there was a part three in there for farming, possibly Tyr's Hand--Tyr's Hand and Hearthglenn are good for farming, from what I know.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I don't know much else to tell you about. I've heard of many people running SM, with enchanting, for shards and whatnot. I don't know how profitable that is, though.<br />
<br />
Edit: Flix posted while I did, and I agree with his mention of herbalism. Being a herbalist myself, that's some big bucks... And as a druid, with 55% speed travel form, you'll get herbs fast. Probably your best choice, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Hehe..I actually got my epic mount in 2 and a half days, starting the procedure at 14g. This was however months after I got 60, I just had never cared about getting my epic mount until one random moment in time. At that moment in time I dropped leatherworking, picked up herbalism, and then lvled it to 300 and added that time to my total time of 2 and a half days. But I just randomly ran around different places. <br />
<br />
I would tell you what places I went to besides un'goro, but I honestly.. don't remember much of anything about those 2 and a half days.. my head felt numb after that.<br />
<br />
My guild has labeled me &quot;The Ultimate Farmer&quot; ever since then.<br />

How many hours did you put in per day? Enchanting, you say? I was keeping Alchemy to get into making potions and stuff, but if you can farm gold that fast... *has wanted his epic mount since October*<br />
<br />
Hehe, I'd follow Flix's tips if I were you, Fantana... That's a pretty insane speed to get the epic mount at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">12-27-2006, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I don't enchant stuff much in reality. I have nearly every non-OMGRARE enchant out there, but I never really go around selling the enchants unless a guildie/friend wants them(In which case I of course give for free with mats), or someone personally requests it.<br />
<br />
However..D/Eing makes a TON of money VERY fast. A single lvl 55 green will usually DE into about 10g worth of mats on my server. I have DEd every one of those BoE greens everyone gets from instances that most people sell on the AH I have ever gotten on this character that I haven't used. Plus of course DEing my old gear when I replace it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I focused on Winterspring and Felwood for the most part. Those two zones are very easy to travel back and forth to and in those two zones you can farn all the good stuff. Icecap, Mountain Silversage, Dreamfoil, Gromsblood, and even Black Lotus.<br />
<br />
 A couple other decent places for lesser herbs are Blasted Lands and Swamp of Sorrows. Between the two zones you can farm up alot of Blindweed, Sungrass, Gromsblood, and some Fadeleaf.<br />
<br />
 There is ALOT of gold to be made farming herbs.</div></div><hr />
