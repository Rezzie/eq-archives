Spirit is the more healing-focused stat.  However, you will have a rough time of it if your max health is too low, it really helps your raid survivability if you can at least take 1 hit from a mob without instantly dying.<br />
<br />
If your raid buffed health is at least 9k, you're fine imho.  Pile the rest into spirit.<br />
<br />
You didn't ask about intellect, +healing, or mp5; I assume you know these stats are also very useful for healing druids.  Let us know if you want some more details on what these do.<br />

- stamina: increases your total health by 10 per point of stamina<br />
- intellect: increases your total mana by 15 per point of intellect<br />
- spirit: increases your mana regeneration while not casting by 0.56 every 5 seconds (0 while casting, unless you have the talent Intensity, then it is 0.08 every 5 seconds while casting)<br />
<br />
<br />
Spirit also affects the tree of life Aura - the more spirit, the better your aura will be.<br />

What item or items are you intending to enchant?  Or do you mean all of them? :&gt;<br />

Slight change....<br />
if you are a tree druid, its:<br />
<br />
+healing, spirit, mp5, int and stamina<br />
<br />
The Spirit gives you additional MP5 and +healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suppose a warrior in your group is the main tank.<br />
You have 1000 spirit.<br />
<br />
25% of 1000 = 250.  So the warrior (and everyone else in your group) will receive up to 250 extra healing from spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I lead raids we normally have 2 warrior tanks and 1 paladin tank.  I put these 3 in group 1, along with a warlock for the imp aura, and whichever tree druid has the most spirit.  That way, all 3 tanks receive some extra healing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have also been talking about making spirit more useful somehow, although I'm not certain on exactly what they plan to do with it.<br />

<br />
I agree with the above order, too. For Tree of Life healing: +healing, +spirit, +mp5, +int +sta.<br />
<br />
You'll find a lot of healing gear has int on it, so it'll come naturally. The only think you'll need to balance out is spirit and mp5. However, with today's change, the upping of Intensity, it may make spirit even more important, now. But I hadn't tested the affects of it yet.</div></div><hr />
