<br />
I use to use it for Counter-strike, and now ive been using it with a few friends and i during WoW.  Helps alot during instances, some people can get really annoying though  :crazeye: <br />
<br />
Oh Yea, Ventrillo is a microphone program such as Team Speak and Roger Wilco.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another good one to use if you've got like two-four people, is Skype. It's much clearer quality, but there's no push-to-talk, it's just like a real phone call pretty much =-p It doesn't support large groups, and wouldn't be so good to try even if it did, but it's nice for a couple friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muchew</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ventrillo is amazingly clear if you join the right server.  I join a very popular Radio ventrilo that they use to have guests come on there online radio.  I just go to a different room.<br />
<br />
Also in setup, you can change it to pick up your voice as you talk so u dont have to press a button.  However i prefer a button</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right.. Ventrilo can do that, but it's not recommended, it can cut people off and sound wierd. Generally no push-to-talk is bad for gaming anyways, just depends on who you're with. And the clarity of Ventrilo depends on the codec the server is running, but Skype still wins out in clarity and quality. The big disadvantage to Skype is that it uses more resources than Ventrilo does, I had troubles using it on my old shoddy computer well running CoH/EQ where as Ventrilo would run just fine.</div></div><hr />

We looked into purchasing a Ventrillo server, but quite honestly, the Ventrillo Dev's were jerks so we decided to stick with TeamSpeak.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a big counterstrike player as well, so I already knew the benefit having the ability to function as a player while communicating. I type fast as hell and it still doesn't compare, I can't control my character while I'm typing.<br />
<br />
You are at a huge disadvantage if your group is not using this in pvp.</div></div><hr />
