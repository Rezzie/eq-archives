They've freely admitted we need new textures, but it won't be out immediately after the expansion.  It takes a very long time to do fur textures so I'd guess 6months to a year before we actually get to see good textures.</div></div><hr />

I hate to disappoint, but that's a Model Viewer image using a polar bear from Winterspring. I just drew out the Druid shoulder graphic and masked that onto Mr. Bear. Allahanastar is probably correct; I haven't seen that Glyph in beta yet.</div></div><hr />

Surprisingly, I'm actually not very familiar with this particular community; however, someone pointed me here also wondering where I'd managed to pull the polar bear graphic from.

Huge improvement in every way imo, and the much improved cat hitbox eliminates that bug.  His tree skins are quite beautiful as well.<br />
