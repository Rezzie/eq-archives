<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">06-23-2005, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on  Cazic Thule and I just wanted to say a HUGE thank you to the guild &quot;The Relentless&quot;. They are the top guild on this server, yet they have helped me out many times even though I am only lvl 56. They dont know me at all, and each time they assist me it is different folks from the guild.<br />
They have patience and are always eager to help. Many think that a top guild would have &quot;stuck up&quot; attitudes, but these folks are the nicest and they are what keeps EQ alive.<br />
On many occasions they have reached out to me to join them in a hunt, even though i am only lvl 56 and i am not equipped to fight the mobs they do. But they also included me in their loot. They taught me how to be a Druid and how to fight.<br />
Basically, these folks are what EQ is all about. Being there for each other.<br />
When I lose faith in this game and get frustrated and wish to quit, I just think of how there are folks out there like &quot;The Relentless&quot; and it keeps my spirits up. I know this game will survive for a long time as long as these folks are around.<br />
What makes them special is that they Volunteer their services, I have never reached out to them first. They reach out to me first and other lower level folks also. That's what makes them so great.<br />
Thank you &quot;The Relentless&quot; for everything :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I have never personally run into you ( at least not under your Grove name ), I'm sure glad to learn that you have had some positive experiences with us.<br />
<br />
I'll make sure and pass your message along to the guild.</div></div><hr />

Any kissing up to, or other form of flattery, done to Scirocco is considered against the rules! Your druid license will be revoked, and your case will be reviewed to decide if more serious action needs to be taken.</div></div><hr />

I have been on and off EQ since October 1999 ..........and this guild really stands out as being a bunch of great guys and girls. I used to have a bad opinion about all high end guilds thinking they were only out for themselves, but The Relentless proved this extremely false, thanks again :)</div></div><hr />

But you know, I think that can be said for a good portion of the folks I have met from upper-end guilds. There seems to be a perception of them as being snooty or arrogant, but overall I've never found that to be the case. Sure, I've run into a few here and there, but as a general observation most of the members of high end guilds are nice. Ok, Sildan is weird too, but still nice.</div></div><hr />

Ya just figured that out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noirblood</div><div class="date">06-24-2005, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it seems like its hit or miss. Either a guild prides itself on honorable members or it lets in any swine with 200 AA's and two hands to type.<br />
<br />
Surely there are diamonds in the rough in all guilds, but most high-end guilds have a pretty well-known rep and most of them are either really good or really bad.</div></div><hr />
