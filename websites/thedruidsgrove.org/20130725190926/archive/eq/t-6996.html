<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fyyr Lu'Storm</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Betty Friedan is arguably the most influental person in the Feminist movement of the 60's through 80's.  Was her discounting of Freudian diagnoses of female hysteria incorrect, that is to say; did we supplant the name for the same condition with just a different title.  I find it rare in this day, to have a conversation with a woman, and her not tell me of some female family(usually mother) member suffering from so called Bipolar Disorder(when the topic is addressed).<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of what Freud believed to be biological, instinctual, and changeless has been shown by modern research to be a result of specific cultural causes. Much of what Freud described as characteristic of universal human nature was merely characteristic of certain middle-class European men and women at the end of the nineteenth century.<br />
<br />
For instance, Freud's theory of the sexual origin of neurosis stems from the fact that many of the patients he first observed suffered from hysteria - and in those cases, he found sexual repression to be the cause. Orthodox Freudians still profess to believe in the sexual origin of all neurosis, and since they look for unconscious sexual memories in their patients, and translate what they hear into sexual symbols, they still manage to find what they are looking for.<br />
<br />
But the fact is, cases of hysteria as observed by Freud are much more rare today. In Freud's time, evidently, cultural hypocrisy forced the repression of sex. (Some social theorists even suspect that the very absence of other concerns, in that dying Austrian empire, caused the sexual preoccupation of Freud's patients.) Certainly the fact that his culture denied sex focused Freud's interest on it. He then developed his theory by describing all the stages of growth as sexual, fitting all the phenomena he observed into sexual rubrics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Betty Friedan (1963)<br />
The Feminine Mystique<br />
<br />
<br />
Were feminists wrong about Freud all this time?<br />
<br />
If Freud said that hysteria was caused by sexual repression, then why do we see it today(if bipolar disorder is what Freud called hysteria)?</div></div><hr />

We are speaking about the most mysterious and adaptive organ in the body.  <br />
<br />
I frequently see studies about scientists finding this biological cause of that emotion (or searching therefor), and I wonder why the assumption is that the chemicals cause the emotion, rather than simply signifying that the emotion is present.<br />
<br />
Part of it is the somewhat admirable goal of shifting public opinion from blaming those with mental or emotional disorders as &quot;weak&quot; to &quot;proving&quot; that those who suffer the problems have no control over it.  I say somewhat admirable because while I agree that the vast majority of those suffering such disorders are in no what to blame for it, but I question the long term benefits of attempting to find causation solely on biological causes since it shifts attention from attempting to locate and correct the social causes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can they not(if I understand what you mean)?<br />
<br />
To me it is no different than watching a dog while eating, growl or snap at another; just for getting close(a behavior I have seen in humans).  Behavior has its foundation in physiology; I mean is there any doubt of that?<br />
<br />
But you can control most of those behaviors if you chose to, super-ego.  I have no idea what the new post-Freudian word/label is for that model..<br />
<br />
If what you mean is that we can will our way out of reflexes and physiological behaviors, I don't think the majority can/try to do that.  But I know that there are those who can, lying people who pass lie detector tests for example, retardation of gag, flinch, or patella reflexes as others.<br />
<br />
So the question the becomes a relativistic one.  At what point is a person defective for not controlling behaviors through will?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest issue to me is that Frued stated causality between sexual repression and hysteria (bipolar etc).  I know a few sexually repressed individuals, they are not bipolar.  I know a few bipolar individuals, they are not sexually repressed.  And more to the point in regards to the women's movement was the idea that sexual repression ONLY affected women, and that women secretly desired to be men and that caused many psychiatric problems.  This is where the women's movement really had some issues.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, although he may have had his causality all messed up, more women suffer from depression and bipolar and anxiety and and and  than men.  Who knows whether this is social (men don't report it or seek help, women feel more free to do so) or physiological, but the numbers seem to represent more women seeking help with depression/anxiety/bipolar/obsessive-compulsive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So have I.  It seemed ludicrous, frankly.<br />
<br />
My unprofessional, unscientific, anectodal discussion of sexuality with lesbians is kind of pointing to it not being completely as far fetched as it seemed to me originally.  The type of **** that they prefer, for example.  I think what got me going in this direction something(lot of things really) that Camille Paglia wrote back in The Sexual Personae.<br />
<br />
And considering my belief that a) female homosexuality has been more tolerated(even nurtured) than male homosexuality through our history b) females have a higher degree of negative social outcomes to sexuality than males c) women lie even to themselves about their own sexuality; which points to many more female homosexuals(or bi) than stats(census) show.<br />
<br />
I am still working on that hypothesis, though.  Needs more research.</div></div><hr />

Here is a fun one, try this one at parties:<br />
<br />
Them: She's an alcoholic.<br />
Me: What's an alcoholic?<br />
Them: Someone who has alcoholism.<br />
Me: Sounds bad, what is alcoholism?<br />
Them: Alcoholism is a disease!<br />
Me: How do you catch it?  Is it like crabs?<br />
Them: You don't catch it, you inherit it like diabetes or epilepsy.<br />
Me: Then it is genetic?<br />
Them: Yes.<br />
Me: You get it from your parents or grandparents or ancestors, right?<br />
Them: Yes.<br />
Me: What about the American Indians?<br />
Them: What?, ya like them.<br />
Me: But the American Indians did not have alcohol until da 'White Man' gave them 'firewater'.<br />
Them: Huh?<br />
Me: The American Indians came from Asia across the Bering Straight land bridge about 15,000 years ago.  They had not invented alcohol yet, did not even know it existed.  They had no alcohol for 500 generations, at least.<br />
Them: Huh? land bridge?<br />
Me: How can you inherit alcoholism when there is no alcohol?<br />
Them: Well if you are an alcoholic, you just know it!<br />
Me: Ya, like if you are an idiot, you know that too, right?<br />

I don't like words that hide the truth. I don't like words that conceal reality. I don't like euphemisms or euphemistic language. And American english is loaded with euphemisms. Because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. Americans have trouble facing the truth. So they invent a kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it. And it gets worse with every generation. For some reason it just keeps getting worse.<br />
<br />
I'll give you an example of that. There's a condition in combat. Most people know about it. It's when a fighting person's nervous system has been stressed to it's absolute peak and maximum, can't take any more input. The nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap.<br />
<br />
In the first world war that condition was called shell shock. Simple, honest, direct language. Two syllables. Shell shock. Almost sounds like the guns themselves. That was 70 years ago.<br />
<br />
Then a whole generation went by. And the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue. Four syllables now. Takes a little longer to say. Doesn't seem to be as hard to say. Fatigue is a nicer word that shock. Shell shock ...Battle fatigue.<br />
<br />
Then we had the war in Korea in 1950. Madison Avenue was riding high by that time. And the very same combat condition was called Operational Exhaustion. Hey we're up to 8 syllables now! And the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase now. It's totally sterile now. Operational Exhaustion: sounds like something that might happen to your car.<br />
<br />
Then of course came the war in Vietnam, which has only been over for about 16 or 17 years. And thanks to the lies and deceit surrounding that war, I guess it's no surprise that the very same condition was called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Still 8 syllables, but we've added a hyphen. And the pain is completely buried under jargon. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br />
<br />
I bet you, if we'd still been calling it shell shock, some of those Vietnam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. <br />
<br />
I bet you that.<br />
<br />
But it didn't happen. And one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language, that language that takes out the life outta life. And it is a function of time it does keep getting worse.&quot;<br />

I heard Carrie Fisher talking about it.  She had it badly.  Apparently in the manic phase you have a couple days of extreme energy where you feel you can do anything.  She'd start these nutty home improvement projects and work at them 24 hours a day.  She said she virtually didn't sleep in the manic phase.  Actually, the manic phase sounds kind of fun.  Then that phase wears off and you sink into the worst depression you can imagine.  Now everyone has mood swings, but bi-polar disorder is well outside of normal.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't confuse this disease with bi-polar bear disorder which afflicts those big white bears who aren't choosey about the gender of their mate. :p<br />
<br />
Fyyr, I heard a guy who studies memory talk about PTSD and its causes. It was fascinating.  He was talking about how you remember emotion provoking things far better than just dry facts.  They did an experiment by telling two stories, one that provokes emotion, one that doesn't.  And the emotion one people remembered the details far better the next day.   Anyway, they found the presence of adrenaline makes memories stronger.    So imagine having a very emotion provoking negative memory that you keep replaying over and over in your head.  The memory will get stronger in time because it is getting reinforced with all that adrenaline release.  It won't fade like a normal memory.<br />
<br />
One of the ways they're treating PTSD is to give people who have suffered a trauma like that an adrenaline suppessing drug, so that the memory isn't reinforced.<br />
<br />
I always kind of poo-poo'd PTSD too until I heard this guy talk about the actual mechanics of memory and hormones and how they affect one another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, the manic phases aren't normally &quot;fun&quot; ;P.  There are plethora of ways in which the manic phase expresses itself.  Frequently manic episodes are borderline psychosis, a person embarking on madcap &quot;adventures&quot; with little or no concept of the repurcussions.  Multi-thousand dollar shopping sprees that aren't affordable, streaking, sudden trips across the country to see your friend from the 3rd grade whom you've not spoken to in 25 years, engaging in sexual relations with complete strangers (when this isn't the norm for the individual).  Things of that nature.  In some people the manic phase includes an increase in anger and violence, though it isn't typical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PTSD can be caused by either a single incident (rape, witnessing a buddy get killed), multiple randomly occuring events (being shelled, child abuse, never knowing when it's going to happen) or repetitive ongoing trauma (torture).<br />
<br />
From my own (unfortunately) personal experience, what you stated in your post sounds right Panamah.  The 'fight or flight' system keys itself up to be constantly at the ready, and the smallest thing can push one into a full blown adrenaline response, making normal living quite difficult.<br />
<br />
Keeping a person on adrenaline suppressing drugs like valium (benzos) will eventually reset the homeostasis in the brain chemical balance, but it is not a quick fix.  When the brain eventually resets so that it isn't in the heightened state of readiness, then the drugs can be lowered and the person hopefully will go back to leading a more normal life.<br />
<br />
Of course, the drugs, without concommittant therapy aren't nearly as effective.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, these same drugs are highly controlled substances and sold on the black market as a drug to get high or 'warm and fuzzy' on.  In people with PTSD, the drug does not create any sense of euphoria, it just eliminates the 'jumpiness' of day to day living.  Wanna buy some drugs?  They'll make you feel perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
Better living through chemistry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to hear you had to experience that yourself, Jinjre. Sounds like the drugs worked in your case?  <br />
<br />
I wonder if the reverse would be true?  Could you take something to stimulate adrenaline production while you're studying for an exam and better retain those memories?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jinjre</div><div class="date">03-16-2004, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The studies I read about test taking all essentially said whatever state you were in when you studied for the test should be the state you're in when you take the test.  So if you're pulling an all nighter and are hyped up on chocolate covered espresso beans, save a few for the day you take the test.  I&quot;m sure the more you can focus, the better you'll retain the information, and when we're in a heightened state of consciousness, as we are during an adrenaline rush, we tend to focus much more closely on things around us.  The flip side of that is that while our senses are heightened, our higher thinking skills tend to be diminished (hit first, ask questions later type thing).  <br />
<br />
When I was in college (more years ago than I care to admit to), there was a story about some French medical students who accidentally overdosed on strychnine.  Strychnine is similar to nicotine in how it acts as a stimulant, but also has amazing properties to sharpen critical thinking and mental retention.  Where would be a good place to get stychnine?  Rat poison!  So they assayed a bunch of rat poison, figured out exactly how much they needed to titre into their bloodstream and were mixing it with their coffee to get an edge in school.  Unfortunately, rat poison only needs strychnine 'in excess' so the levels aren't terribly tightly controlled.  The med students got a different batch of the same brand, but there was more in it than was in their original assay, and they OD'd on it.  Nicotine is also horrendously poisonous and it doesn't take much to OD on it, if you have it in liquid/syrup form.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the drugs have fully worked or not, as I'm still on them.  Depending on the severity and length of trauma, it can be a few months to several years for homeostasis to reset itself.  In my case, the trauma was quite long term (13-18 years, intermittant and unfortunately random, which makes it 'stick' in the brain that much more.  Random negative reinforcement is one of the strongest forms of reinforcement out there, 2nd in line only to random positive reinforcement like gambling and EQ have), and although I've been on the drugs for over a year, I&quot;m guessing I have at least one more year to go.  On the plus side, the drugs do subdue the 'jitters' and I no longer jump out of my skin or habitually clench my teeth, or 'brace for impact' for no reason whatsoever, so even though I haven't finished the treatment yet, they have improved the quality of my life significantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If true(hey truth is part of their name, right), then nicotine itself should be relatively inexpensive.  I mean if they are just putting it into cigs, and not increasing the cost of cigs, it can't be expensive.<br />
<br />
Ok, then, and we all know that it is the tar and other burned materials which cause most of the harm to the body.  Right, You with me so far?  The nicotine itself is relatively harmless(it is not, I know) compared to the smoking of the rest of the delivery system(cig).<br />

But as they say (and if I could ever get that damned monkey off my back, I'd agree), better the gum than the cigarettes.  The gum is actually about the same cost in terms of how it works in the body, as are the patches.  There have been no studies which indicate that the gum causes anything other than jaw muscle tension headaches and slight stomach upset in some people (like me &gt;&lt;).<br />
<br />
I don't know the stats on how many become addicted to the gum/patches.  I can tell you it's easier to quit the patch than cigarettes (managed to quit once for a 2 year period).  It seems every 6 months I try to quit, sometimes I do better than others.<br />
<br />
So if any of you were thinking you'd like to become a social leper by taking up smoking, I'm here to tell you now that it's an evil evil addiction.</div></div><hr />

The key is persistence.  If you quit and start again, just quit again the next day.  One thing that made it easier for me was using the patch and also knowing that after 72 hours the addiction part was psychological, not physical.  So all I had to do, in my mind anyway, was make it 72 hours and I knew I had it licked.  Not that it was easy after that, it wasn't, but it got progressively easier each day.<br />
<br />
After that, you have to make an effort to stay out of situations you associate with smoking, like bars (if they allow smoking) or hanging out with friends that smoke.   One thing about San Diego is that we banned smoking indoors in public places so I can actually go to a bar, if I wanted, and not be tempted to smoke again.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my advice.  Just be persistent!</div></div><hr />
