<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaebler</div><div class="date">04-10-2008, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, my question is this:  Which is better/more important for a low level tree healer?  Spirit or +healing?  <br />
<br />
I spotted Dalewind Trousers in the AH and snarfed'em up:<br />

<br />
Later, I picked up the Windscale Sarong in ST:<br />

<br />
Thing is, I'm not sure which is actually BETTER for me.  I was stoked about the +25 spirit earlier on, but when I saw the +healing legs I instantly felt like those were better.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  I know that gear is gonna be upgraded and changed as I level so its not that big of a deal, but the underlying question will remain regardless of level.  :)</div></div><hr />

The end result is that having more of both increases your regen by a nice amount.</div></div><hr />
