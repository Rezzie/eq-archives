I can't confirm that the mobs need to be snaring for them to drop the shrink earring, but common sense tells me there's a relationship. <br />

My question is, at what point in the task will you be able to solo mobs without any snare / loot issues?</div></div><hr />

What Strat are you using to complete 68.4?<br />
Are you waiting till the disguise drops?<br />
Are you following Overseer Renok to the room in your disguise?<br />
Do Commander Hithrav, Overseer Renok, Protector Iknar, Protector Vrek summon?<br />
How are you dealing with the 5 mobs that spawn when you click the monolith?<br />
 <br />
Just some thoughts<br />

Maybe I misworded the post but I have no intention to complete the entire task - the only thing I'm worried about is figuring out how to get the instance to a point where it's possible to solo for a shrink earring.  <br />
 <br />
What happened: I was trying to duo trash mobs with a guildie of mine to help get him an earring, but we couldn't get the mobs in the instance working correctly.  I'm under the assumption that once you get to a certain point in the task it'll be working correctly.<br />
 <br />
---<br />
 <br />
Before overseer gets to commander no spells will take hold on the trash mobs.  If he gets there and you don't run the script correctly (ie your not standing next to them and don't kill them both) you'll be able to kill mobs but they won't become snared and virtually don't drop loot (so I'm under the impression there's no chance for shrink earring to drop off of spiders at this point in the task.<br />
 <br />
I zoned into the task after he was soloing in there for awhile so I don't know all the exact details.  Overseer got stuck on a wall a few rooms before the commaner somehow.  We duo`d commander -- he doesn't summon, but he'ld be duoable (by the right people) toe-to-toe if single anyways.  Even after killing commander the mobs weren't working correctly.  Before we engaged overseer the person who was filling the last slot of the task left task and logged and task closed before we were able to add another.</div></div><hr />

There was no snare or loot issues at that point..i have never tried killing spiders before the commander/overseer have died tho.</div></div><hr />

The group I have always wipes, or the last time everyone had to leave 3/4 into it. No way would I even attempt to solo it.

Hard version gives an earring to all casters, and the normal version has a 175 HP/mana earring drop from the chest item...not to mention tons of druid-useable gear (pants, hat, charm, augs).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have completed this mission 25 times as of right now, the last 17 of which I have duo'd.   However, when I duo, I use an illusion to drop the drachnid illusion at zone-in, then proceed to kill Overseer separate from commander (the overseer shouts about  intruders and script proceeds from there).<br />
<br />
My question is, has anyone attained the shrink earring in this manner?  The script works fine, and one is able to finish the mission.  I have in fact begun to even flag random people.  The drop tables *should* be the same, but 25x is a bit crazy, even for usual bad luck.</div></div><hr />
