I'm looking at upgrading a few items and get the level 5 focus effects. Still playing with magelo so no link available. Iif you could just list some items that a non elemental druid could obtain that has Mana Pres 5 or some of the other named Focus that effectively is Mana Pres 5 but goes by other names and has more than 10% that would be most appreciated.  /run-on sentance off<br />

<br />
Mine will cost me about 175k to make but you can get some made for about 75k as well (This is baz prices on Trib, cost for Discordant Scoraie + original Aug) I have friends who are doing the combines for free but it might cost you a little more to have someone you don't know make them. <br />
 <br />
I suggest you look that up if you can get a hold of the cash..or farm for a rare aug and discordant scoraie.</div></div><hr />
