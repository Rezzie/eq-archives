 <br />
Could anyone please help me out? I am currently stuck in a place that only has dial up *swallows the rising bile* and am looking everywhere for the graphic of Shield of Dark Hues (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=29906) I would get it myself, but I am not going to be able to log on to EQ for a couple months. If anyone is able to post the graphic I would really appreciate it. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
May have a screen shot somewhere - I carried that one for awhile. Will post it when/if I can find.</div></div><hr />

A more common item with that graphic is the warrior shield from Auliffe (wind tower boss in BoT) - stormrider cataprice.  I'm sure you can find  a warrior who has one in bank.<br />

Ethierway, this is EQ, not fashion-walkway-simulator.  Who cares how the thing looks, just worry about how much benefit it'll be to your play :texla:</div></div><hr />

The point of EQ is enjoyment, whether that is getting the best equipment, a fashion show, hanging out, or getting drunk and running around Kelethin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">02-19-2006, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something today made me think about eq player's concerns about their characters looks -- I was looking at my guild's dkp site, and I noticed that while only a small fraction of my guild is female, about 2/3 of the &quot;pink sparkly&quot; sticks from GoD raids were looted by female players.  And yes, I was one of the few males who looted a pink sparkly stick ;p (needed a new shield as an app and couldn't be picky!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shield from Cypheron for example, should not look like the Sol Ro shield.</div></div><hr />
