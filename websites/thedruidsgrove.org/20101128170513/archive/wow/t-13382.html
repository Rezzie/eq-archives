<br />
everytime I go I say never again !  its not even as though I think there is anything I need in there...i got the Trickery ages ago, which ofc i dont need now /sigh<br />
<br />
unfortunately it was the daily so and its a 'quick' heroic - yeah right :gunfight: so off we go to do it.<br />
<br />
with hindsight we were in a bit of trouble as our dps was low - i was the highest dps we had and mine is not that great given my gear. although i expected a naax/uldaur hunter to be doing major dps. and the mage has not long been 80, gear is so so and she'd never been to VH before.<br />
<br />
first boss...Void one /cry  - we actually killed him but we were all dead...the tank finished him off but also died so we all had to run back in asap and then heal/buff up.<br />
<br />
so we were a little on the backfoot as it took us a while to all run back and iirc the next portal had already opened before we re-entered combat.<br />
<br />
so onto the next boss.....the water one which is not to bad but can be annoying. we get him down with a single death and move onto the last waves....<br />
<br />
somehow due to low dps we ended up with 2 open portals and mobs running around killing clothies so we wiped by the time the last boss came back....suffice to say we failed and had to re-start.<br />
<br />
We did better the next time...Void dead with only 2 deaths ! Water boy downed quickly.<br />
<br />
BUT just as we were on the last portal something happened and i died...i released to run back in to help out ASAP but by the time i got back to the person who puts you back into the fight at the entrance and clicked on him/her it said Cyangoisa was there - and then it would not let me in ?  Not realised or seen that before.<br />
<br />
They did kill her but then I could not loot the Head for the daily.<br />
<br />
So 90 mins or more of the damn place and i did not get to complete the daily - nor did i get a chance at loot but i [B]did[B] get a heroic badge which i found odd ?  no loot, no head but a badge was on the dragon and I could loot it ?<br />
<br />
<br />
no to the dps......how does a 213 geared hunter who also has 2 ilvl 226 items from Uldaur only do 1200 dps ? I thought hunters did high dps !<br />
<br />
that's one of my heroic pet hates....if we have to get people from lfg/lfm we end up with wannabe heroic people in greens and blues who are a liability.<br />
<br />
Blizz need to implement some minimum spec/gear/stats for heroics and not let people in else !!<br />
<br />
I was lower than usual but did 1700...mage only managed about 1000-1100 so you can see our dps was not ideal for VH !</div></div><hr />

Autoshot....Hunters got nerfed hard in the last patch, and blizzard has admitted that they need to fix them (particularily Survival) But, in mostly naxx10 gear, my SV hunter still does ~2.3k, and I am by no stretch of the imagination a &quot;Good&quot; hunter.  He's really just my mats farming whore that occasionally helps out in a raid if my other two toons are locked.  <br />
<br />

There are addons that help with this.  I used to use one called &quot;Inventoryonpar&quot; which is basically a version of Wow-heroes.com assessment in game.  Tells you a person's gear &quot;Score&quot; as soon as you target them.  Makes and easy decision to find someone else.  Unfortunatley, IOP is one of the mods that is in battle with blizz atm over the mod revenue stuff.   :(<br />

Yeah....the mage just sucked.  My mage was doing that much damage before WotLK hit (and FFB = huge increase to lower geared mage DPS)  Literally just spamming one spell in any of the 3 specs will get you 2k+ damage in level 80 blues/greens.  <br />
<br />
One stat on your recount meter that most people never even see is called &quot;Presense&quot; (at least that is what WWS calls it...may be named somthing different on recount, but I am certain the meter tracks it).  This is about 99% accurate in determining why someone DPS is bad.  It tells you who is there ready to pull, from the word go, and sticking with it...and who is &quot;distracted&quot;.  It is basically a % of time you are doing somthing while anyone in the party is in combat.  It's used a lot in raid to say, &quot;Hey, Johnson, do SOMTHING!!!&quot;  People like to afk / RL interuptions...etc.  It happens, but H-VH is a really bad place for it to happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this hunter in MM cant remember exact points spread on talents but it was x/55/x.<br />
<br />
are you saying autoshot was nerfed and that's wot thety all use for dps ?<br />
<br />
yeah i spoke to a guy i know who raids a lot on multiple 80's including a hunter whose not his main. he talked of 2k+ on his hunter and upto 4k on mega hunters in the guild - he just laughed his socks off when i said 1200dps !<br />
<br />
<br />
I may take a look at that addon.  What i tend to do is do a fast wow-heroes check on someones name before we invite them ! <br />
<br />
Re - mage, whats FFB ?  this one does not play much - she in our guild and took a break, her better half is in a big raid guild and always in Uldaur. so i know she will improve over time as her gear improves - it just did not help having 2 out of 3 dps doing such low figures :(<br />
<br />
lol, Presense sounds good ! I will have a look at recounts options !<br />
<br />
i'm certainly not going back to VH for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I am saying he could have achieved 1200 DPS by simply right clicking the targets and walking away until they are dead.  The Autoshot function of a hunter in raid gear is well over 1k all by itself!  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I may take a look at that addon.  What i tend to do is do a fast wow-heroes check on someones name before we invite them !   That addon is &quot;broke&quot; atm, so you may want to find a similar one that isn't in fights with Blizz.<br />

FFB= FrostFire Bolt (its a spell/build that benefits from two tree's talanets (frost and fire).  She is likely Arcane build before her gear justifies it (common downfall of Mage DPS)  or she is poorly glpyhed/spec'd.  Mages are very proc dependant!  We've had several mages in our guild that couldn't break 2k DPS, but a little coaching can go a long way!!!!  <br />
<br />
Mage's tend to be elitist A-holes (not sure why, just seems to be a personality type???), so its tough to find good friendly advice...ElitistJerks/MMO-Champion, tend to just belittle folks looking for advice.  Send her my way if she'd like some pointers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahha frost firebolt - something new given my mage is only 58 and has been a bank alt living in og for well over a yr !<br />
<br />
i know she will do better - her other half raids on his mage so is more than up on what/how to play.  in fact she did some respeccing yesterday and in a good run to HoS she was upto 1500 dps. plus bought 2 epics off AH to help out with betrter gear.</div></div><hr />

I call it my &quot;money run&quot; in /g... I just have to make sure to ask everyone loot ALL corpses when we start.<br />
Are you running these as Boomkin khel? what kind of tank are you usually running with? It's been my experience that warrior tank=ezmode for Voidwalker, but have done VW with all the tanking classes. Just have everyone UNLOAD, pop all CD's (which should be ready for bosses anyways) and ignore adds.<br />
<br />
Have I mentioned how much i LOVE LOVE LOVE kitty dps lately?</div></div><hr />

<br />
tank is a guildie DK.<br />
<br />
why is VW easy mode for a Warrior tank.<br />
<br />
yes we have tried to just dps through the adds even if shifted.  depends on the healer.  not sure on hp of the little void things ? i unloaded starfire when i was shifted but not sure how it did as its too manic in there to take notice !<br />
<br />
i've not done any kitty for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FWIW, I've never done anything other than the &quot;ignore the adds an kill the boss&quot; approach.</div></div><hr />
