Arent the gloves a leatherworking drop from sunwell??<br />
Not easy to get and looking at the mats to craft this....<br />
not for a casual player</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've got myself the nerubhide cloak but until the armour nerf i still like my old resolute cape.<br />
<br />
aiming to farm some mats for trollwoven set.<br />
<br />
i do like the look of them quest gloves you mention Mook from CofS questline to and need to get a set soon.  still on my old merciless pvp ones !<br />
<br />
i'm trying to decide if the Evis Facemask is worth it over a Merciless helm which has gem slots incl the meta ?<br />
<br />
i like the look of the Titanium Earthguard Ring - lots of stam/str and some dodge but 3k atm on my server. needs dragon's eyes iirc which seem to cost the earth !<br />
<br />
what's a good neck then before you have the badges to buy one ?  i'm still using the SSC Exatled one as it has a nice amount of Stam and a socket......</div></div><hr />

<br />
will take a look on the AH for that choker. not planning on running normals so probably unlikely to get the HoS one.<br />
<br />
may save some badges for that purple one though which does indeed look good post the armour nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you said you aren't planning on running &quot;non-heroics&quot; but I strongly reccomend hitting regular HoS.  There is a very nice leg upgrade for you as well in there.  Given the gear you listed above, you should be able to /faceroll regular HoS.<br />
<br />
As for the had piece, your first emblem purchase should be either the chest piece (T7 Token - x80 emblems) or the Savage Glad Helmet (x40 emblems).  Both of these items are very difficult to find anywhere else.  <br />
<br />
To get a better chest you will have to be in 25 man raid.  To get a better helm you have to complete heroic Occ, which is no small task for a casual player.  <br />
<br />
What is your current chest?<br />
<br />
I have also been struggling to find tank gear with +hit on it.  I have more expertise than I could ever use, but I have very little hit.  <br />
<br />
I agree with S3rgio on the neck.  None of them are really &quot;Bear&quot; neck pieces.  You could get the kitty one (agi/stam) but I would not reccomend the &quot;tanking&quot; neck for the emblems.  Stick with the Titanium neck piece if you can afford the mats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've recently made myself the Dark Arctic Chestpiece (and legs) which replaced the old BC 100 badge one !<br />
<br />
Thanks for advice on first badge purchase....i was thinking i'd get that Military Gorget above initially....<br />
<br />
atm i'm using the Betrayer's Choker which iirc was a quest reward and has a socket to. very nice item esp post the armour nerf when its lack of armour wont be such a problem.<br />
<br />
going to get mats over the weekend for the Ring of Earthen Might which is an upgrade from some green quest ring i'm currently using although the titanium bars are 60-80g each !</div></div><hr />

It's the 2nd best leg-item right after the heroic-gundrak one pre-naxx.<br />

<br />
hence i made the Dark Arctic ones.<br />
<br />
i was hoping i may get revered soon with Kirin Tor for the Mind Expanding Leggings.<br />
<br />
and i read that the Handwraps of Preserved History are or have already had a nerf....<br />
<br />
Old:<br />
+68 agi<br />
+103 stam<br />
+100 AP<br />
+40 expertise<br />
<br />
New:<br />
+47 agi<br />
+71 stam<br />
+76 AP<br />
+38 expertise<br />
<br />
these if memory serves are the ones from the CoS chain ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">12-23-2008, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my target list for pre-raid<br />
<br />
WEAPON<br />
Bear: Enraged Feral Staff (H UK)<br />
Cat: Staff of Trickery (H VH)<br />
<br />
IDOL<br />
Both: Idol of Terror (level 70 badges)*<br />
Note that I'm specced for manglespam-style cat DPS.  There are better options for cat if you shred.<br />
<br />
FINGERS<br />
Bear: Keystone Great Ring (H DT)<br />
Titanium Earthguard Ring (430 JC)<br />
Cat: Hemmoraging Circle (H GD)<br />
Band of the Kirin Tor (8kg in Dalaran)<br />
<br />
NECK<br />
Bear: Titanium Earthguard Chain (440 JC)<br />
Cat: Pendant of the Outcast Hero (25 badges)<br />
<br />
TRINKET<br />
Bear: Darkmoon Card: Greatness (Faire)*<br />
Valor Medal of the First War (40 badges)*<br />
Cat: Mirror of Truth (40 badges)<br />
Darkmoon Card: Greatness (Faire)<br />
*After the patch.  Until then, I'm still with the big armor.<br />
<br />
BACK<br />
Bear: Durable Nerubhide Cape (440 LW)*<br />
Cat: Cloak of the Gushing Wound (H VH)<br />
*Once 3.0.8 comes in -- until then, I'm still sporting Thoriumweave<br />
<br />
CHEST<br />
Both: Heroes' Dreamwalker Rainments (80 badges)<br />
<br />
FEET<br />
Bear: Slag Footguards (H HoL)<br />
Cat: Boots of the Neverending Path (Exalted Argent Crusade)<br />
<br />
HANDS<br />
Bear: Heroes' Dreamwalker Handgrips (60 badges)<br />
Cat: Gilt-Edged Leather Gauntlets (H UP)<br />
Until 3.0.8, the CoT:S quest gloves, Handwraps of Preserved History are overbudget and nearly as good as the T7, so it's probably better to save the badges<br />
<br />
HEAD<br />
Both: Mask of the Watcher (H Oc)<br />
<br />
LEGS<br />
Both: Gored Hide Legguards (H GD)<br />
<br />
SHOULDERS<br />
Both: Trollwoven Shoulders (440 LW)<br />
<br />
BELT<br />
Bear: Trollwoven Girdle (440 LW)<br />
Cat: Jorach's Crocolisk Skin Belt (40 badges)<br />
the Sharp-Barbed Leather Belt from H UK is a good fill-in on both sides until you get the badges, and it's almost as good as the Trollwoven for bear, so it may be worthwhile as an interim target.<br />
<br />
WRIST<br />
Bear: Bindings of the Tunneler (H UK)<br />
Cat: Dragonfriend Bracers (Exalted Wyrmrest Accord)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not true.<br />
<br />
The neck is still the one best in the game right now after the armor nerf.<br />
<br />
Here is a beta of Emmeralds list.<br />
<br />
http://www.emmerald.net/WotLK_Beta/Bear_Mitigation/Neck.html<br />
<br />
The neck has more stam and has the armor, it is only missing a little bit of dodge.<br />
<br />
TEC - 350 Armor, +63 Stamina, +34 Defense, +49 Strength, Red Gem slot (+21 stam or +8 agil and +18 Stam)<br />
CMG - +75 Stamina, +32 Dodge, +33 Defense, +41 Strength, +21 Hit<br />
<br />
The blue shifting gem does not exist until the patch so use the +21 blue stam gem.<br />
<br />
That makes the neck<br />
TEC - 350 Armor, +84 Stamina, +34 Defense, +49 Strength<br />
<br />
That means TEC has 350 more armor, 9 more stam, 1 more defense, 8 more strength and 32 less dodge.<br />
<br />
They are both good.</div></div><hr />
