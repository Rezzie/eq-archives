<br />
why dont people do in bg what they do in grps - stay together and play as they do normally?<br />
<br />
am i the only one who has encountered this problem?<br />
<br />
its exactly like playing counterstrike or day of defeat, which, imo, isnt worth it.</div></div><hr />

I just act like I give a damn about the flag early on, and just run around massacring people.  Then when it's about time to win/lose I will team with a druid and we will run the flag ourselves!</div></div><hr />

While organization isn't what it could be most times, it's much better than WSG pickup groups I got into.  Even in a loss, the bonus honor is very good - since it's based on what resources you've gathered.  I think the lowest my team has earned is about 1500 - basically against an organized alliance guild that's on teamspeak/vent.<br />
<br />
My favorite run came on Friday, when I held off 4 alliance assaulting the stables for a full minute or 90 seconds before they downed me just as reinforcements arrived.  This was only possible because they had no rogues lol.  2 rogues stunlocking = quick death even in bear form at the start.<br />
<br />
Thing I hate the most - people not joining the raid.  If I could make one improvement to battlegrounds, it would be to force people all into the same raid while in the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have noticed the same thing..the groups always seem to be all over the place and not really going places together, just going to the nearest place they see an enemy.  Of course its always going to be hard to invite everyone to the raid grp, sort them out into even groups (few tanks/healers/casters in each) and then give instructions on what each group should do, given that once u join the AB instance u have like what, 2 mins before it starts lol.<br />
<br />
It would be awesome to be in a totally organised group, u would smash the other team, even if they are higher levels than u...<br />
<br />
i guess theres no real solution tho, just try to join a raid grp on ur first run then hopefully the majority of that grp will keep entering the next battle as a grp, and u get ur **** sorted hehe.<br />
<br />
the druids survivability is awesome for AB tho, makes it heaps of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">09-21-2005, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must be lucky.  So far the majority PuG I have ran with have won AB.  Usually we manage to get just about everyone into the raid mine 2-3 people.  Sometimes though I don't even join the raid but still, with my group we cooperate and it all works out.  I went into AB 4 times with 3 other guildmates and rather than join the main raid just formed into our own group, but still cooperated with the current raid leader in the AB instance and held defensive postures on the mines.  It was sweet, horde didn't take it from us at all during our 4 AB maps we particpated in.  We won those maps also.  <br />
<br />
And as a Druid I love AB, the small group pvp skirmishes, and defensive tactics really flesh out the people who know their class and the people who don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One druid can defend a node long enough to reinforcements to arrive. :)<br />
<br />
Remember: They can't take the node if you have a constant moonfire on them.</div></div><hr />
