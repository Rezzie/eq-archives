<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorran</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most PoP zones have DC-bait mobs in them (even the Elemental Planes). There is usually an animal specific one (druids), an undead specific one (necros) and a generic one for the chanters. You can't use them to tank like you can with a CoK or CoT pet, but they do add a pretty reasonable amount to your DPS in a group, especially once hasted.<br />
<br />
The ones I remember (Tier 2+ - most Tier 1 zones have quite a few DC'able mobs, assuming the zone has animals of some sort):<br />
<br />
PoValor - a small tree frog<br />
PoStorms - a grezlan cub<br />
PoTactics - one of the boars, can't remember its name<br />
CoDecay - a scrounging rat<br />
PoTorment - dunno, always forgot to check on raids.<br />
BoThunder - None that I know of<br />
Lair of Terris Thule - None.<br />
HoHonor - a wrulon cub (or something like that)<br />
HoHonorB - None.<br />
Tower of Sol Ro - None that I know of<br />
PoFire - a young obisidian spiderling<br />
PoWater - can't remember name, but I'm sure I've seen green con mobs in track in here.<br />
PoEarth - can't remember its name, but it spawns when one of the armadillo things dies<br />
PoAir - dunno<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

 <br />
  Quite rare.<br />
 <br />
&lt;strong&gt;PoTactics - one of the boars, can't remember its name&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 <br />
  The 4 boar spawn are all, to my knowledge, PHs for the enraged (which got nerfed from about 1 spawn in 10 to 1 in 100, /rude SOE) so using it as a dire charm pet just cuts your chance of getting named significantly if you're clearing the pit.<br />
 <br />
&lt;strong&gt;PoTorment - dunno, always forgot to check on raids.&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 <br />
  a small raven hatchling?  Theres a rotting ... as well which is the necro one.<br />
 <br />
  All in all if you're grouping it's a pretty good AA.  If you just solo it's fairly worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone ever actually xp in that hell zone?<br />

Kiting mobs at the entrance for tradeskill drops (not the best xp in PoP, but it doesn't suck) and guards near the bridge (until I got too close to one of the named Phoenix's and he charmed me - for 15 minutes - it finally broke and mashed Exodus - whew)*<br />
<br />
*I did know a paladin who got charmed for 45 minutes there, same way. Insane.</div></div><hr />

Now that we get the spell Summon Companion, can we do this? I don't have DC yet or I'ld give it a try. Would appreciate any info from someone who's tried this. <br />

DC'd him once was green to me at 65. Next time I went there it was a dark blue con. Apparently the Raven DC'able mob is not always there. It was to left by itself. Two were to right together. (This was near zone btw before entering walkway)</div></div><hr />
