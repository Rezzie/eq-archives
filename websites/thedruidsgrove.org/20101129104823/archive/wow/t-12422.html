My new guild seems pretty haphazard in most things.  There's no attempt to divide up healing in any manner, each healer just gets whoever.  We have 2 druids and a pally generally.  How do other group divide up the healing chores, or do they?<br />
<br />
I should mention, we've actually downed Shade of Aran even with our lack of coordination. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">02-22-2008, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, for my Kara runs, the healing isn't really assigned.  <br />
We use (2) healers most of the time, myself and either a priest or a holy pally, and our runs are pretty smooth.<br />
<br />
The only time healing assignments have ever been mentioned have been for Moroes, when one of us is on the off-tank.  <br />
<br />
Although not much direction is given to the healers, our part is pretty obvious, there's lots of instructions for other classes.  Freeze this, Shackle that, Kick him, Mis-Direct!  :tongue:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">02-29-2008, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My group also does not assign healing in Kara/ZA, except for very specific parts of certain encounters.<br />
<br />
I.e., For Hex Lord Malacrass during Spirit Bolt our priest will PoH her group while the other healer and I (pally, druid) take up the other group.<br />
<br />
If you think the overheal from not assigning roles is excessive, then go ahead and assign roles.  With three healers in Kara no one should be having mana problems under normal circumstances IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">02-29-2008, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For our runs we only use two healers, but I've personally found the DPS to be worth way more than having the extra healers.  Of course every single one of our tank assignments includes someone with on off healing set.  (Druid or Pally) so its not a big deal.  Our OT just off heals on the important fights that need extra healing.<br />
<br />
We only do two healing assignments.... who has MT and who has OT.  Other than that, we fly pretty loose.<br />
<br />
The only exception I make to this is when I have a tree druid healer.  In those instances I tell them, the Druid has both tanks and then the other healer's job is to just top them off where necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">02-29-2008, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  I always figured at least on the Moroes there would be an assignment of a druid to heal the rupture dmg.  But truthfully, it wasn't really that bad.  I don't know why but my old guild the healers always seemed to be overtaxed.  I played my rogue in that guild and it seems like I was always just barely clinging to life and popping pots right and left.  This guild I've had to hardly even pop innervate on most of the fights so far and melee dps seems to get good heals.  But then again, I've only been as far as Aran with my healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sey</div><div class="date">02-29-2008, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a druid you should heal kara thusly:<br />
<br />
- maintain rolling triple lifebloom stack on the tank<br />
<br />
- in your spare cycles drop a lifebloom on any dps taking damage.<br />
<br />
That's usually it except maybe when tank is taking big damage throw rejuvenation on him also, and maybe swiftmend / regrowth.  But do so in between lifebloom stack refreshes... so your stack keeps rolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">03-01-2008, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, my first run with my new guild my task was to heal the raid and keep HOTs on the tanks.  It was a bit more than I could handle to keep the lifeblooms up on the tanks all the time while healing the raid as well.   But I'm happy to report the WWS stats had me at the top of the healing charts with the least over healing.  <br />
<br />
But I have another question, if you have a dps that draws a lot of aggro, do you avoid using lifebloom on them?   Just wondering if that might be a good practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">03-03-2008, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't get too excited on your lack of overheal.  Druids naturally have low overheal because our Overheal shows up on  the person who we are healing kind of.  Lifebloom's &quot;bloom&quot; effect shows up under the person you hit with the heal.  So you may have an overheal of 3k at the end that never gets counted against you.  However yes Druids tend to own the healing charts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As mentioned above, we druids don't get credit for the final bloom or the heal/overheal it does.  We also don't get overheal for HoT ticks when the target is already at full health.  In fact, I believe we only get overheal for the initial Regrowth heal, Swiftmend, and Lifebloom blooms on ourselves.  So ... yeah.  There's no reason why you shouldn't be at the top of the healing meter, but don't read into it too much.  :D<br />
<br />
As for keeping blooms on the tanks while raid healing, that'll come with practice.  At first practice keeping two stacks going on two tanks while just using one GCD between refreshes.  After that becomes cake, use all of your GCD.<br />
<br />
But I have another question, if you have a dps that draws a lot of aggro, do you avoid using lifebloom on them?   Just wondering if that might be a good practice.<br />
<br />
If you have DPS that draws a lot of aggro, tell them to l2play.  You shouldn't have to resort to this, but tell them straight up that you will not heal them if they pull aggro off of the tank under normal circumstances.<br />
<br />
If they are simply taking slow damage (which is typical in a raid setting), then a Lifebloom should be enough to top them off.</div></div><hr />

I never expected heals.  The only DPS I think should get a few heals are melee DPS classes like Kitty Druids, Rogues, DPS Warriors and Pets.  Depending on the encounter, they will suffer some AoE damage that they just can't avoid.  Throwing a HoT on them between LB shouldn't be an issue, but the tanks always get priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had my first two 25 man raids and I was at the bottom of the raid healing in both, so my little ego bubble is burst.  I think I'm going to start using macros for lifeblooming the tanks as using grid/clique in such a large raid seems difficult, what with all the running around trying to avoid cave-ins and what not.</div></div><hr />

Trees ARE super efficient, make no mistake about that, heh ... just not to the degree that your healing meter would like you to think.  ;)<br />
<br />
Not topping the meters isn't necessarily something to sweat.  As long as you were doing your job and the raid succeeded, that's all that matters.  There are raid healing duties that just aren't conducive to huge healing numbers.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would suggest sticking to Grid+Clique over ... it'll take a while to get used to, but it's certainly the easiest I've ever healed!  :lmao:</div></div><hr />

<br />
And topping the meters isnt necessary but it gives your ego a boost ;-D<br />
i love it, to play with full concentration and let our schami-healer behind me!!<br />
U dont have to be first, just try to keep up with the rest.<br />
In my guild the top 5 healers are less than 0,5% away from each other at the end of the night (if no unnecessary deaths in trashies).<br />
<br />
For help in healing:<br />
Dunno all the addons available and what they can do.<br />
I had my experiences with X-Perl-Unitframes and Pitbull.<br />
For me, Pitbull is a blast. It has so much things u can configure. And i love the thing that i see all my hots on raid-frames and the timer to it. Only Problem is, that i cant get the MT-Targets work.</div></div><hr />

We've already gone over how this is a completely unfair statement.  You will never know how much overheal you actually do.</div></div><hr />

Any suggestions on configuration that makes that easier?  I have most of the grid modules, but the configuration is challenging (to say the least!).</div></div><hr />

The whole point of Grid is to keep your unit frames compact!  If you are really having problems here, try configuring the layout to group raid members by class.  Then your warriors and druids will all be in the same columns.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">03-12-2008, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will do that.  But sometimes tanks are druids or paladins.  It'd be nice to have Grid let you define who the tanks are. :(<br />
<br />
Other times I am supposed to heal my group but also include another tank, so I have to kind of preserve my group in the Grid.  It is confusing!  Maybe Ora2 could be of use... gotta figure out how to use that, I know there's a module in Grid that uses it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">03-12-2008, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I just suck it up and move my cursor around the grid to click the tanks.  All it takes is some getting used to how your raid leader likes to set up the groups up.  For me, I know that the MT and OT are always going to be in group one (with me), the feral druids are in group 2 (melee) if they're tanking for a certain pull, etc.<br />
<br />
What I would recommend for you is for you to keep your party frames visible even in a raid, and then position your Grid frames close to your party frames.  This way you can still keep a close eye on your party (using your party frames) while focusing on the tanks (using Grid).<br />
<br />
I have actually never figured out how the 25 w/ tanks layout is configured (is it using CTRA or oRA2?) ... if anyone has any insight here it would be much appreciated!</div></div><hr />

Turns out I didn't have the Ora2/Grid mod loaded, so I loaded it.  It puts an extra group at the end of the grid with the tanks.  But then my own group was at the extreme other end so it wasn't really much help.  I ended up turning it off.  Gosh, if I could just rearrange the columns of boxes I could have what I need.<br />
<br />
The option is, once you download that mod, 25 with Ora2 tanks (and that works with CTRA too I think). <br />
<br />
Have you ever found any really good guides on configuring Grid?  I'm always on the lookout for one.  I'm sure there are a lot of options I could use that I'm not.</div></div><hr />
