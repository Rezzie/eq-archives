<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenmarel the Banisher</div><div class="date">11-15-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently my computer chair of many years broke.  It is still barely holding on but the writing is on the wall that it's time to buy a new chair. I see a lot of people come on the forums and ask for computer adive but, I don't ever remember people coming on the forums asking for chair advice.  So I am wondering if anyone out there in the Grove has any advice on a nice computer chair that is confortable and ergonomic?  I am looking to spend under $300.  I have been looking at alot of differnt chair sites one thing that interested me was this chair (http://www.officemax.com/max/solutions/product/prodBlock.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;expansionOID=-536880778&amp;prodBlockOID=537044822) I was wondering if anyone had experience witha chair like this?  Seems like it would be ok until you wanted to lean back and kick back a bit.</div></div><hr />

The best office chairs are out of every normal person's budget. The one I'm thinking of is out of Chicago called Case, but it's impossible to google.<br />
<br />
I just took myself to Office Depot/Max/whatever, sat in every chair until I found one I liked. It's going on 3 years now? My requirements: long enough in the seat to support my full upper calf, padded/cloth covered arms, normal adjustments (up/down, tilt, etc.). Nothing special, just works.<br />
<br />
About 3 months after I bought my chair, my fiance's chair died. We did the same thing (went and he tried every chair) and he ended up getting exactly the same chair.</div></div><hr />

You can skimp elsewhere.  They're the BEST!<br />
<br />
Don't just go and bid tho.  Do a little research about them and you'll see what they're all about.  Oh!  and 12 year warranty if you get a new one.  I believe that the warranties are also transferrable if you buy a used one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hermanmiller.com/CDA/SSA/Product/0,1592,a10-c440-p8,00.html&quot;&gt;Aeron&lt;/a&gt; chairs have gotten really popular in the last few years, you probably see them a lot in various offices.  However, they're not cheap, they usually run around $500-700 easy.  Used, they're still usually over $400.  I &lt;i&gt;would not&lt;/i&gt; suggest any of the knock-offs that are made of this chair.  They usually skimp on the mesh bindings, so your chairs will start to fray like wicker.<br />
<br />
However, if you're like me, and you're a cheap bastard, I went into places like Best Buy and CompUSA/OfficeMax/OfficeDepot/Staples for my $100 or less chair.  Staples and the other various office stores usually have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.staples.com/Catalog/Browse/Sku.asp?PageType=1&amp;Sku=451585&quot;&gt;this chair&lt;/a&gt; or some variant on sale for $40 or less.  Don't expect Italian leather or anything like that, but it usually serves it's purpose.<br />
<br />
When you go looking for a chair, I suggest making a list of features you want, like I did.  For my chair, I had to have:<br />
- Adjustable arm rests (move up and down)<br />
- Adjustable seat height<br />
- Adjustable seat position (ie: I wanted one that rocked back and forth, not just locked)<br />
<br />
Cloth or leather didn't matter with me, as long as it wasn't, you know... hot pink or something.  One thing to check out - where ever the wheels go - make sure that part is sturdy (metal if you can find it).  The sockets that hold the casters in place are the part most likely to die first.<br />
<br />
I found a good little gray fabric chair at Best Buy for $45 with everything I wanted.  Lasted me a good five years before I accidentally ripped the seat open while opening a package :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and one more thing - when buying a cheap chair like I did, make sure that the seat is padded well.  On one of the cheap chairs they had at OfficeMax, you could feel the screw that held the seat onto the lifter through the cushion.  But heck, if it's cheap enough for you to suffer through that, you could always buy the chair and then get an additional seat cushion.<br />
<br />
I lied, couple other things - <br />
- If you have back problems, prepare to spend more.  Chairs with real lumbar support are usually expensive (jacking up the price over $100 easy).<br />
- Figure out how much space you have to use your chair.  Don't get a gigantic full sized chair when you only have a 2x2 area.<br />
- Full sized or half size?  Do you need a chair that you rest your head on, or is one that only comes up to your mid-back fine (I like mid-backs, I hate full sized ones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I manage a power plant. This included setting up all aspects of a new organization, including buying office furniture. The furniture included the usual desks, tables, chairs, filing cabinets and shelves.<br />
<br />
The power plant has a control room that is manned 24 hours per day.<br />
<br />
By far the most expensive piece of furniture in the plant is the chair used by the control room operator. It cost $1,500. From a business perspective, comfort, functionality and back support for the employee doing the most critical job in the plant is absolutely essential.<br />
<br />
If you use a computer chair a lot, you shouldn't scrimp on the cost. (No, you don't need to spend $1,500 --- Lol). With the possible exception of a bed mattress, a much-used ergonomic chair is the most important piece of furniture you will buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenmarel the Banisher</div><div class="date">11-16-2004, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I tried the Office Depot pick a chair route 3 years ago with this chair.  I wasn't satisfied.  I really need to but a chair that I can spend extended periods of time in.  Currently I am unemployed and have been spending long periods of time in my chair in the last 6 months.  Even beyond the time I was spending in my chair when I was employed.  I easily spend 12 hours or more a day in my chair.  So I need to buy something that will be every bit as valuable to me as my computer.  I was hoping to do that for around $300 but, it might be worth it to spend more if I know for sure what I am getting will be worth it.</div></div><hr />

We used to buy the cheap Office Max chairs $80 and go through a new one every month. (24 hour job) I finally convinced my boss to buy a really nice chair so that it would last longer and we still have it going strong after 2 years of abuse. Now granted you're probably not going to abuse your chair as much as some of my employees do, it's still well worth the comfort.</div></div><hr />

If you can't afford the Aeron, go for the Mirra.  Not a knock off Herman Miller, but a true Herman Miller.  12 year warranty... that's a LONG time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its predecessor, you know on some chairs you can set it to either lean backwards or stay rigid upright?  Well I always liked the chair rigid to lean back on.  Only all of a sudden it'd go CLUNK and set itself to lean, making you almost fall off and have a heart attack :p</div></div><hr />
