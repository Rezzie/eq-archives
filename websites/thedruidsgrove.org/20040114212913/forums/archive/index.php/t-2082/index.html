<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moridin the Mad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, at level 52 I got 5% exp per othmir quad and 2-3% exp per wyvern quad in CS.  Then the patch hit and I got only 1-2% per wyvern quad and 3% per othmir quad.  Now, I am level 53 and I only get 2% per othmir quad!  And 1% per wyvern quad...  To top it off othmir quads take around 80-90% of my mana.  What's going on? I should at least be getting othmir quad right? Did SoE screw around with the xp tables in the last patch? Someone fill me in :(  <br />
<br />
Edit: If this isn't my imagination and exping now just sucks, could someone fill me in on a better way to get experience?  2% for a full bar of mana just isn't worth it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Are the othmir around level 47 by any chance?<br />
Levelling up to 53 might put you out of the 5 level range that gives you a bonus 95% exp...<br />
<br />
On the bright side, with level 53 you get Glamour of Tunare, so between that and Call of Karana you should be all set to start charming instead of quadding.  Charming is MUCH better for exp, and a lot more fun too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moridin the Mad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just checked.  The max othmir warrior level is 46, so that definately isn't it :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
My understanding is that both you and the mob have to be 50+ for there to be any bonus XP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, could be...I thought only the player had to be 51+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AmonraSet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not all levels are equally long.  Could be that L53 is bigger than L52 and so you get the same amount of xp, but it makes for a smaller percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I moved to skyfire and slugged my way through a few levels kiting wurms there.<br />
<br />
The exp blew but I was able to farm all my missing spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It used to be that 51-53 were roughly the same length, 54-58 were around 2 to 2 1/2 times as long, and 59 was 4-5 times as long (as 51).<br />
<br />
A while back the levels were supposedly smoothed out.  I know this is the case for 1-50, but I don't know if 51-59 were adjusted in the same way.  60 is as short as ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's not. Level 51-59 still have the same old horrid hell levels and exp curves. <br />
<br />
And yes you will notice a drop in exp for a given quad when you ding. It's normal. At a certain point you need to move on to bigger and tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
What you'll also find is quadding is going to have dimishing returns as you level because your stuck with that same old lightning spell. I'm quadding in PoM right now, most are light blue and not worth the exp at all. I just do it for the drops.<br />
<br />
If I want exp, I charm and break charm as mobs are ready to die for full exp.</div></div><hr />
