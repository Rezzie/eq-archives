<br />
I've been trying to distribute my talent points fairly evenly between feral/balance/resto and haven't gotten very far on any particular area...<br />
<br />
right now my druid is level 22, and there's still a LOT i have to learn regarding general gameplay and strategies for the most effective attacks.<br />
<br />
I've been reading over other threads and it seems that when i do that, i come away with more questions than answers...<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go with a bi spec, balance / resto, feral / resto, resto / feral, resto / balance<br />
<br />
and I think you'll be happier in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The more common bi-specs tend to feral/resto or balance/resto.<br />
If you distribute your points well you'll be able to play 2 roles quite well and the 3rd role will be a bit weaker but gear can improve it.<br />
<br />
Leveling up, a feral/resto build will be much more suitable imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yea, that makes sense.<br />
<br />
then we get into the discussion where balance/resto is good for moonkin and feral/resto is good for bear and cat, right?<br />
<br />
moonkin isn't even a consideration at this point, as i don't even have a clue as to what level i can get moonkin... i've seen other threads regarding the advantages of moonkin, if one is up to the challenge of learning how to play him, and would probably consider re-speccing down the road (a good ways) as far as it goes right now though, i guess i'll concentrate on feral...<br />
<br />
i've been asked to be tank in the WC instance, and didn't get very far... is there a good general rule of thumb as tank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">12-14-2006, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thing with moonkin is that is pretty gear dependant.<br />
<br />
No doubt a moonkin can be a lethal ally, but feral/resto is a proven good allround specc that can be decent even with pretty average gear.<br />
<br />
But in the end, try different styles and play the one you feel most fits you. One advantage of druids is that we can &quot;grow&quot; into our roles better than many other classes.<br />
<br />
I don't remember much of low-level tanking as a bear. But when you hit dire bear at 40 things will become easier.<br />
<br />
GL with whatever you choose. I'm sure you will find &quot;your&quot; style. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">12-14-2006, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking of gear, is there any good low level gear that i should keep an eye out for? if so, where?<br />
<br />
i currently have the amor of the fang chest and gloves... I'm thinking about running back through WC in an attempt to pick up the rest of the set (only cause it looks cool :lol:  )<br />
<br />
seriously though, it seems that the bonuses get good when you have the whole set... is there btter low level stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-15-2006, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So leveling up as an intended tank on a new server (my friends and I like to break the mold with specs and still succeed, we've hit nef in BWL this way and are salivating over BC, where offspecs seem to become very viable), I will tell you that in the early levels, for tanking and WSG, stamina is king.<br />
<br />
To hold aggro, you just have to maul and taunt.  Not much else you can do at your level that doesn't burn rage like no tomorrow.  More important than your ability to tank is your group's ability to assist.  If they're hitting every mob in a group, and you're not, then they get to tank it.  =]<br />
<br />
I have played about every spec under the sun with druids and found some fantastic trinity specs.  For me, however, nothing beats a feral/resto build for all around viability.  Down time is almost nil.  You have decent DPS and decent heals.  You can fill 3 of 4 roles in a group (melee dps, tank, healer). You can even do a little casting!<br />
<br />
In the lower levels, if its an upgrade at all, go for it.  Don't hold out for 'that awesome piece' as it's likely you will find better before you actually get that piece.</div></div><hr />
