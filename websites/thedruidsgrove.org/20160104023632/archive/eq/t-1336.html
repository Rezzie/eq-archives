It allows you to specialize in additional trade skills thus exceeding the 200 cap.  It can be trained 6 levels and the first one costs 3 AA points.  I didn't try it out because I only had 2 to spend.  I seem to be the only person that had in on the server, so I thought I would share the news.  <br />

That was listed as a PAXP ability on some PAXP pages I saw.<br />
<br />
I don't think it is meant to be live yet.<br />

And I for certain don't think that it was meant to replace HA for druids.</div></div><hr />
