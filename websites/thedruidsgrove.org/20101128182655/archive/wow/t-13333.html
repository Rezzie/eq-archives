<br />
My Guild has 4 10man-groups open right now.<br />
My group is built of 10 good friends so we are having a really good time in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
We downed so far:<br />
- Flame Leviathan<br />
- Razorscale<br />
- Deconstructor<br />
- Assembly of Iron<br />
- Kologarn<br />
- Auriaya<br />
- Hodir<br />
- Thorim<br />
- Freya<br />
<br />
Whats left:<br />
- Ignis (not doable in this weeks ID because of the one-hit-bug when he grabs u)<br />
- Mimiron<br />
- General Vezax<br />
- Yogg-Saron<br />
<br />
The ohter 3 groups have downed Deconstructor yesterday, so they are a little behind.<br />
<br />
Raided 3 nights this week. So we are doing quite fine i think.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are only 3/14 in.  (Leviathon, Razorscale, Decon)<br />
<br />
Our raid nights are Weds only atm, so that consisted of about an hour of actual playtime, surrounded by server crashes and lockouts and Ignis spankings, the other 2 hours....grrr.<br />
<br />
We did form up and head back in to get Razorscale down on thurs, but again only for about an hour.  (Casual guild, and GM doesn't want the 10 man team alienating themselves from the rest of the guild, especially since most of the guild officers are in the 10 man)<br />
<br />
Our second raid night (friday) we are keeping for our Naxx25 so that the &quot;lower&quot; geared/skilled raiders aren't left in the dust.  They still struggle with some of the fight coordination in Naxx, so Ulduar is out of the question for a bit.<br />
<br />
Our plan is to push our 10man through to learn the content then try and bring the 25man team in.  <br />
<br />
With only about 3 hours a week to focus on Ulduar, I think we will be needing a few weeks before seeing more than 5-6 bosses a week.  :(<br />
<br />
Good news is one of the trash mobs was bugged and dropped a 25 man boss epic staff for our healer!!!   (shhh)</div></div><hr />

Going back into 10s tonight so hopefully can do something with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">04-24-2009, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We made our first stab at 10-man uldar last night with zero advanced reading.  We died a few times just running around.  Then we noticed the colored towers and focused on those (I guess that is what we are suppose to do??).  Things went well when we focused.  We quickly read up on the boss and wipe'd.  I think we got him to 60%.  More reading and a few other strategies (put someone on the boss to kill his guns???) and we got him to 40%.  That's it.  I think we wiped 5 times on the boss???<br />
<br />
Things I know we didn't consider that I have become aware of after we stopped....<br />
<br />
Everyone (just the drivers??) should wear their max ilevel gear as it used to determine the health and maybe damage(?) of your vehicle.  I know we have players still wearing blues and maybe greens, but I don't think they were drivers.  But I know I didn't have my max ilevel gear on but I certainly could put together a full ilvl 200 purple set if I mix a couple of sets and use a healing idol I bought.<br />
<br />
Seems like we need someone (ranged dps???) on the boss to kill the guns, but to get them on the boss you have to throw them from a demolisher.  Once you thrown one, you lose the ability to use charges that are suppose to be very important to our DPS.  Which, I guess, means we have to have folks run between vehicles mid-fight, or use all of our charges before we throw someone on the boss.  Someone told me they throw a healer and a ranged dps on the boss. Why a healer?<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Anyone do this on 10-man?  In 10-man you have access to 2 of each vehicle type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2x Seige Tanks (4 players):  These folks are responsible for &quot;Kiting the boss&quot;  We try to drag him around the outer edges of his little area.  His threat seems to be kind of random so demo's have to be ready to kite too.<br />
<br />
2x Demolisher (4 players):  Demo's have to DPS the boss and throw their gunner onto the boss after a while to destroy his turrets.  We send a high melee DPS (ret pally) and an Ele Shammy who helps to heal those two as needed.  Once turrets are destroyed those two are thrown from the boss.<br />
<br />
2x Motorcycle(2 players):  The motorcycles have to go and pickup the two that were thrown off the boss as they take massive damage when not in a vehicle or on the boss.  Demolishers should be at max range as often as possible, incase they get aggro.  Bikes must also drop the Oil slick thing that slow and damages the boss!</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm, I really don't know...I have always tanked (all 2 times) and I know they are constently picking up the barrels, but I was under the immpression that the barrels were like &quot;ammo&quot; and they had to have them to use their abilities...I am not sure the rotation though.  I know the oil+fire are the most damage the boss takes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing for the siege engines is that they should be saving their second ability (the shock thing?) for Flame Jets to interrupt that.  Also on the trash that are the big Collosals, make sure to interrupt their ground slam thing.  <br />
<br />
Motorcycles just zip around spamming attack and dropping oil between the boss and the thing he's chasing.  Pick up passengers if need be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have wiped so many times on the furnace master (over the past week), I hope we never try him again. We just don't seem to have a good handle on how exactly to deal with the adds considering our group make-up.  Some times I think I should re-spec moonkin just for that fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're a bit stuck at Mimiron though. =/   Always die in Phase 4.  Anyone has any tips I'd be happy to hear.  <br />
<br />
I've been swapping between healing and tanking fights.  So far the Thorim fight is really my favorite.  <br />
<br />
tlbj: For the Ignis fight just throw on a stam set and tank the adds.  If you get a pocket healer you can pretty much just stand in the fire until it gets 10 stacks and turns red.  When it's molten there's an aggro drop so make sure to pick it up.  Then drag it into a pool.<br />
<br />
We tank Ignis between the two pulls in four spots making a box<br />
<br />
  o  -&gt; o<br />
[S] |:newburn: | [N]<br />
     o &lt;-  o<br />
<br />
Moving clockwise, when he scorches one area, we drag him to the next spot spreading the scorches out.  Add tank should stand in the newest scorch he can and then just drag it over to the pool after it's molten.<br />
<br />
Have a hard hitting ranged DPS attack them when they're brittle.  We call out north or south pool over vent and then as long as you have a DPS that can do 5k damage in a crit or more, the golems should explode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-05-2009, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's more or less what we've been doing, though we don't kite the boss around.  The tank stands in the water and just turns him left/right when we need a scorch spot for the adds.  Typically what happens is I, on the adds, die because I have 2-3 adds on me at the same time when they turn red (their damage goes crazy at that time), or 1-2 other folks die from the red adds on the way to the water (they do AoE), the belly thing or just are stupid and step in the fire.<br />
<br />
I think in the 15+ attempts we have killed 2 maybe 3 adds.  Our best attempts have been when we just ignore the adds and dps the boss while I tank him in the water.  Got him to 30%.  We could probably do it that way if we had top notch DPS.  As you have ~5-5.5 min to kill him before the add buff results in a near one-shot on the tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the Mimiron-Fight we split up our DD in Phase 4.<br />
The parts need to get killed at the same time and if we are splitted, one of each section can always tell the casts of mimiron so we can react!<br />
If u are through phase 1-3 it should be easy with a little practice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">05-06-2009, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, we had them split up but on our best attempt we were really close and the melee didn't notice a death rocket target on them and they all blew up gloriously.  ¬¬;  <br />
<br />
Hopefully this week!<br />
<br />
@tljb: If you have a bunch of adds on you and you're not trying to kill them I wouldn't bother turning them into the flame.  Also if you time the add killing right you should only have 1 add on you at a time.  Especially now that you only need 10 stacks to go molten.  I suppose if you guys have really heavy heals you could try the burn method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-07-2009, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We tried it again last night with 5+ wipes.  The &quot;best&quot; attempt we got him to 85% in 5 min.  We did the &quot;kite the boss in a square&quot; method.  And we did deal with the adds quite a bit better.  I (cat spec) put on my SP set and did nothing but root (and mark) the adds once they were pulled into the fire by the off tank (pally).  Once they are rooted, a hunter (and later a mage??) were assigned to pull them into the water and kill them.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure what is wrong.  Once the person assigned to kill the adds dies, it is a wipe.  And often the OT dies??<br />
<br />
The other real problem we have is that when the DPS pulls the molten add, it seems that they always end up running back to the OT about 3-5s later.  Not sure what the OT (pally) is doing to them...  but when this happens it is a wipe as the molten adds do insane AoE damage as they run across the room, usually killing a healer or DPS.<br />
<br />
And having 3 people dedicated to the adds, really hurts our boss DPS.  As 15% in 5m, means the fight would have taken 35m.  There is no way the healers would have lasted that long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">05-07-2009, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am not sure what the &quot;Right&quot; way to do it is, but here is how we do it. (2 shotted this week)<br />
<br />
1) I (OT in FR set) pickup the ad and drag it into the scorch.  A boomkin roots him as I am kiting (I stand outside of the scorch while the mob is taking the ticks).  Once he's molten I charge in to pickup aggro (full aggro dump once molten) or a simple taunt should give you enough focus to get them into the water.  Then the same boomkin starfires.  And the mob is dead.  You have to be quick to make all of this happen before a second mob comes up.  <br />
<br />
The difference in our strats is that I am taking the crazy hard hitting mob into the water, so the ranged DPS is never at risk of threat.  We only lose one DPS off the boss this way to focus on killing the ads.  Even a terrible geared boomkin will crit well over 5k to kill the mob.  <br />
<br />
Note:  You NEED a backup OT (ret pally or kitty works well) who can keep the mobs busy if you get pulled into the slag pot.  I don't reccomend your backup to try to get the mob molten, but rather just OT it until you are out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-07-2009, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The question I have is how does blizzard expect us to do this encounter without a boomkin?  Maybe just an OT in FR gear is all that is needed?<br />
<br />
On several occasions I have tried to OT the adds in the fire while standing outside the fire, but they never seems to turn molten.  It seems the edged of the fire &quot;area&quot; is not at the edge of the floor graphic.  Though there must be some way to do it.<br />
<br />
Guess I need to start looking for a FR set.  Don't we have a thread on that elsewhere???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">05-07-2009, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we do have a FR thread somewhere, but I can tell you the bulk of my set is the &quot;Blastgard&quot; Items.  Lvl 69 Rares, LW crafted by Aldor Exhaulted LW.  Mats are cheap, but good luck finding an LW who has exhaulted Aldor Rep!  :)  <br />
<br />
I spammed Trade for 3 days looking for one.<br />
<br />
Anywho, my set is:<br />
Blastgard Pants/Boots/Belt with all 7 sockets with x24 stam gems.<br />
Random green FR Cloak from AH w/ FR enchant<br />
Badge Gloves from TBC (x25 Badge of Justice I think)<br />
<br />
I am around 360 FR with Mark on myself.  With Pally buff I am well into the &quot;Excellent&quot; resistence to fire and about 35-38k health in 10 man.<br />
<br />
I can stand dead nuts in the middle of the scorch tanking a molten mob without overstressing a healer.  Infact, our first Ignis kill was without a boomkin, when you had to stack to 20.  I just stood there and took it the whole time.  I sucked up an entire healer though.  Now, Healers just HoT me and ignore me!  :P</div></div><hr />

I know Kalon has a list on his site for Sarth3D (http://wowthinktank.blogspot.com/2009/02/druid-gearing-and-strategies-for-heroic.html), that doesn't include any BC pieces.  But some of it would require that I re-enchant my current gear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">05-07-2009, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We don't bother rooting the adds anymore actually since the debuff stacks so fast so there is no need for a boomkin.  You do need a pocket healer for this fight though for add duty.   <br />
<br />
If you awnt have the DPS give you a couple of seconds to get away before they nuke the add.  The add will explode in 10 man so long as someone hits it with a crit of 5k+.  But it also does AoE damage when it explodes so try to get out as soon as you get it in. <br />
<br />
I did this last night on 25 man and didn't use any Fire Resist.  I just threw on my stam set.  You will need a healer on you.  In 10 man I place a healer on the tank a healer on the OT and another healer on raid heals + both.  <br />

zomg though, Heart of Iron totally dropped and I got it.  I was a very happy bear. =D</div></div><hr />

The Primal fires and Waters were a bit pricey on my server too. <br />
<br />
The lake up in &quot;Skettis&quot; in Terrok Forest has piles of water ele's that aren't farmed anymore.  Took me about an hour for all 10 waters.  Get a &quot;Water Breathing&quot; potion of some kind (I had some in my bank) and you can grind them in a real hurry.  <br />
<br />
Also, you can solo several of the TBC instances, so no need to bother a shammy!  :whistle: <br />
I farmed the HFC instances and Coilfang ones solo, took 3 days (maybe 4 hours total) to get the badges.<br />
<br />
SD is actually useful here, as it sucks up almost all of the damage you take from lvl 73 bosses.  :)</div></div><hr />

Hehe, I definatley was in full Naxx-25 bear gear!  Its also mostly my kitty gear, but you want lots of stam.  Also, you don't need to kill any of the ads before the first boss!  Just backup into the &quot;door&quot; that opens behind him.  You will avoid all the mobs!<br />
<br />
I stealthed through almost all of the instances, only stopping to kill trash to clear space to fight bosses.  When fighting a boss, don't forget to go kitty, dash, Regrowth, Rejv, and bear backup to finish off the bosses.  The Eyeball guy (with 4 rooms of ads) I would kill the last mob from each room kitty-corner from the next one that was opening so I had time to HoT myself up before the next pull...that was the hardest boss.</div></div><hr />

We wipe'd 6-7 times on the furnace boss.  First we tried DPS race as we had much better DPS than what we normally have.  But only got him to 25% in 5m (at that point your tank can be one-shot at any moment).  Then we tried it 4? times with me wearing FR gear that I managed to collect (I had 343 FR raid buff'd).  Got him to 50% a couple times, but some healer or DPS always seem'd to die in the pot, etc.  One time I taunted the boss rather than the adds (dumb ass bear).<br />

So, we decided to combine the methods (not sure why we never did this before), I MT'd in my tanking gear.  And our DK did something (skill? talent??) along with some buffs (pally and potion) to get to 250 FR??.  I'm not sure why the DK didn't mention he could do this before.  He took the adds and pulled them into the fire/water until boss was just below 50%.  At that point we just off-tanked the adds and DPS'd the boss.  We wiped the first time because I had never tanked the boss in the &quot;square pattern&quot; before and didn't do something right.  The second time we got him.  Not sure how many adds were on the OT, but I didn't feel like I was getting pounded by the boss, so it must not have been too many.  4-5?<br />

We go back in tonight.  Here's the WWS (http://wowwebstats.com/djugfoll2yunq).</div></div><hr />

Ignis is one of those bosses you will look back a month from now and think..&quot;Oh, look, free loots!&quot;<br />
<br />
Once you have the pattern down and your OT is comfortable with their job, there is really no reason to collect.  Its just more stress on the healers.  They go molten uber fast now, so dedicatiing 1/2-DPS, 1/2-Healer, and 1-tank to the job is a pretty efficient way to get him done easy-mode.  Collecting, puts added stress on your MT healer and your OT healer.  I guess it depends where your raid strengths are.  We like to run only two healers when possible, so extra stress for the OT is a given for this one!</div></div><hr />

Once you have the pattern down and your OT is comfortable with their job, there is really no reason to collect.Not sure what you mean by &quot;collecting&quot;, I think you are basically saying there is no reason not to properly deal with the adds (OT them into the fire, turn molten, pull them into water, range DPS nukes them).<br />
<br />
The one thing that helped way more than was probably obvious to the rest of the raid was that we had significantly more DPS than we normally do (we had 3+ doing 3K, normally, we have 1).  While this boss isn't technically a DPS race, it is certainly a RNG vs healer race.  Get the wrong person in the pot at the wrong time can cause all sorts of healer stress.  Do that once you might live, have the RNG hate you twice and you'll wipe.<br />
<br />
The same is true for the Deconstructor fight.  If you only have 1-2 good DPS and they get the light/gavity bomb on them all the time, your DPS suffers and the boss enrages.  But if you have a solid core of good DPS'rs, you can live thru the fight with one DPS AWOL most of the fight.  In fact, that happened to us on this past run.  Our top DPS'r died (not sure how) early in the fight (before the first heart phase??).  Once I saw that I thought we'd wipe.  But since we had 1-2 other DPS'rs that were &quot;good&quot;, we lived.<br />
<br />
Most of these issues are more of a concern in 10-man than 25-man where a single player makes a huge contribution.<br />
<br />
Interesting you run Ulduar with 2 healers.  I thought I read that Blizzard built Ulduar to be primarily a 3 healer raid (10-man).</div></div><hr />

Yep Collecting = more than 1 ad up at a time.  Should only happen if the OT is in the Slag Pot.  <br />
<br />
As for the healers, we always run with 2 healers full time and a hybrid with healing dual spec to jump in for the &quot;Non-DPS&quot; race fights.  We have only cleared through Freya, but our 3rd healer only heals for Kologran &amp; Freya.  (We are blessed with several very talented healers though)  DPS is our biggest weakness.  One of our Resto-Druids solo healed most of Naxx10 (Prepatch)!  Obviously some fights he couldn't because of fight design, not damage out put.  It was sickening.</div></div><hr />

On our 4-5th attempt, the boss is near 80%, I hear across vent &quot;Damn!  The earthquake just killed me!&quot;  I'm thinking to myself, &quot;this boss doesn't do an earthquake, maybe he meant the slam???&quot;.  The end results is a wipe.  During the recovery I discover that the 5+ players that live in the Los Angles area just had experienced a rather large real earthquake!  One of them said &quot;I had to grab my laptop so it wouldn't fall off my lap!&quot; (which begs the question, How the heck to you play wow with a laptop actually on your lap??).<br />
<br />
So, one of those wipes should be classified as an &quot;Act of God&quot; wipe.<br />
