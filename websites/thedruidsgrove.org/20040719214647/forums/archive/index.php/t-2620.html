I do a lot of charming in PoS - will spending AA points to get my innate CHA up help?  What is a good CHA number to get to for charming purposes?  I don't want to give up other stats on my gear to increase CHA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should buy innate charisma to help you get a better price at merchants.  <br />
<br />
My anecdotal experience is that the thing that improves charming the most is debuffing MR of the charmed mob.  Other than that, maybe levels helps, maybe not.  I never noticed charisma having much affect although it won't hurt either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">100 seems to be one of several &quot;important&quot; points in a stat.  Around 100 cha (varies slightly) you'll get the best prices from indifferent vendors; at 100 stamina fatigue affects nothing except your ability to jump; I believe there's a relatively large jump in AC at 100 agility.  I'd get your charisma to at least 100 if you can.<br />
<br />
You may want to look at grandmastering a tradeskill, particularly brewing if you want to master something quickly.  The grandmaster trophy things have 50 charisma on them (and 10 wis too).  That's a nice boost for a single slot, and it can fit into any of primary, secondary or ranged slots.  Plus you get a &quot;free&quot; permanent 100% weight reduction bag (10 giant slots, wt 1.2) and the ability to summon additional no rent ones.  The trophies do cost a few thousand per attempt though.<br />
<br />
Levels and target MR definitely make a large difference, but charisma does appear to make enough of a difference to be worth raising a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tham Treehugger</div><div class="date">07-28-2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been charming for over 80 aa's now with sub 100 char (was at like 76 until a few weeks ago), and I can't complain about charm duration at all.<br />
If cha acctually helped charms I'd be very surprised, because that'd mean even longer durations and less charm breaks than I already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocalypse Criterion</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My experience is CHA has absolutely no effect on druid charming, it only has an affect on merchant prices and the chance that a mob will aggro you on a harmony resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AzariahTunare</div><div class="date">07-30-2003, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my GM trophy about a week ago (50 charisma).  So far, I've noticed no difference in charming at all while wearing it.  <br />
Breaks just as often.  <br />

I don't have the exact text, but the idea is higher cha = less resist. <br />
<br />
Says nothing about duration.</div></div><hr />

If your cha is 85 and you have enough gear to raise it up to about 125.. you may not notice. However, with my cha gear and a chanter buff my it is 218, and I can tell compared to a higher level druid with 125 cha. Call it chance or good luck, but certainly says something to me. <br />
