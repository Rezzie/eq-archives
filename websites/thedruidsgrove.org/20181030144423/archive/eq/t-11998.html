Gah, if that's for real, I'd wish wizzies would get it, too.  <br />

What I really hate is running through PG to a trial and someone who demands the 'good' invis at all times keeps breaking it to loot.  :rolleyes: <br />

But why on earth give a healing class that bandage wounds one???</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the only ability i care about.. everything else is just a retred of what we already have... or an improvement.. We have never had an AA pet spell. This means in the future, this will only continue to improve.<br />
<br />
This could also be some forshadowing on druids getting an upgrade on booboo the bear. They did say we are getting new spells in this expansion.. How many nukes and class line spells can we get at level 70? We already have Class level 70 spells and Ancient spells. They going to move to Super Ancient spells? I think we may get a better pet.<br />
<br />
Even if it was in line with the power of a shadow knights pet at level 70, id take it.</div></div><hr />

A new fire nuke.<br />
A new heal guessing a new 10 second heal since it is so out dated.<br />
A new dot.</div></div><hr />

SoE has stated that they are trying to phase that line of spells out of the game.  The other 2 sound right probably.</div></div><hr />

Thanks.  Read that one, but (perhaps it's because there were more incomplete listings around than complete listings) it was missing from this post at the top.  Just noticed now though, that some classes are missing entirely from this list too.</div></div><hr />

First of all that's not a complete or finalized version<br />
<br />
Second of all this is a druid site, I believe other class sites have complete and finalized (up to now) versions of their AAs and Spells/Discs. <br />
<br />
IMO if you wanna be better informed, you should go to other sites until someone prepares a better list with all classes.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't noticed some classes were missing until after the initial posts (meaning it was incomplete but looked complete at first glance).  Anyways, I'm glad that the group camo includes both druid and ranger, I'll be buying it first on 3 characters.  Thanks all for the confirmation, I'm looking forward to the expansion, especially on the chars I had maxed the aa's on.</div></div><hr />
