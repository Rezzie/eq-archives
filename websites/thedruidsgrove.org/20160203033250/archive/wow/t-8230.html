I've also been looking for the last 3 weeks for a trainer who will teach me 1h Mace.<br />
<br />
I finally found one last night.  The place is called Timberline Arms and its located in the military ward in Ironforge.  There is a weapon master to your right as soon as you walk in.<br />
<br />
You can train 1h Mace, 2h mace, and fist weapons.<br />
<br />
Good luck fellow druids !!!</div></div><hr />

Everyone mentions taking off the gear to avoid damage/repair costs, but no one mentions directions. I really want to train up the weapons now instead of later. Any advice on the way to go?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">09-12-2005, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I'd advise waiting until after level 10 to make the run... you have the Moonglade teleport then, so you can hop back to Darnassus fairly easily.<br />
<br />
Optional: Bank all your gear in Darnassus.  This will save you repair costs if you die while running over.  Next, take the boat to Menethil from Auberdine.  In Menethil, grab the flight point, then you can mostly just follow the road through the Wetlands.  Keep going east, then south, then west into the tunnel.  Watch out for the orcs and keep running through to Loch Modan.  Follow the road, optionally stopping by Thelsamar to pick up the flight point.  Follow the road south again, and take the west fork into Dun Morogh.  From then, it's pretty easy going into Ironforge.</div></div><hr />

I decided against training fist since, well, useless. So I now have 4 weapons and unarmed at my disposal.<br />
