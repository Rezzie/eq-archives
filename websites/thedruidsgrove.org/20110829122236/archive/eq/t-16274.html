I wonder if they plan on reimbusring people for actual cards in the future heh.</div></div><hr />

If I want to play cards again, I'll dig out my collection and go about rebuilding a deck and gather together with other players in a social setting.  Hell, half the fun of Magic was in the gathering.  <br />
<br />
I have no desire to play LoN and I'm already quite sick of the never ending tournament spam in broadcast messages.  Its become quite apparent that in order to continue to play Everquest, I must deal with being subjected to LoN garbage even though I have no interest in it.<br />
<br />
So much for LoN being optional.<br />
<br />
When was the last time some Everquest in-game feature was spammed at players non-stop for days and days and days on end ?<br />
I don't recall incessant broadcast message spam inviting players to partake of LDoN raids or to take a run at MPG trials.<br />
<br />
I equate LoN to the precursor of pop-up ads in game.   EQ is now a real-time billboard for other Sony products to come.</div></div><hr />

They give you some really crappy cards. I bought 3 booster packs with the smallest of hope I would get a mount. AA horse speed, very nice. I want a cat.<br />
 <br />
It is amusing if you are really bored and just sick of soloing and waiting for something. Also if raid is getting ready but going to take quite a while. You can still keep an eye on chat windows to make sure you aren't needed. One way to really piss everyone off is to play LoN during a raid and miss stuff<br />
 <br />
The only real good thing about LoN is the chance to get a loot card. You can get 1 of 4 mounts (kirin, chimera, snow leopard, and panther), a few items (the only real good one I saw gives you 7K endurance and 10K mana every 20 hours), 1 of 4 weapon cards that let you permanently change the graphic of it's item type (1hb, 1hs, 1h piercing, etc), or a potion pack (things like 10K mana or 10K hp fillers, exp potions which are way overpowered. There is no real recast time. I know someone who has a lot of money and has gotten 55 of these).<br />
 <br />
If you don't want to spend money for a pretty worthless thing in hopes of getting a useful but rare loot card you just have to loot booster decks if you are lucky enough to see one drop. They are supposed to drop in any zone from any mob that cons light blue or higher (1 in 300 mob drop rate my ass.)</div></div><hr />

Friend said no loot in it but some cool cards for his deck.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
BUT...  I really do want a mount (snow leopard).<br />
 <br />
Guess I will buy a bunch of booster packs and try my luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladred</div><div class="date">09-25-2007, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The card game is seriously sweet. I personally love TCGs and haven't played a decent one since MTG. LoN plays very well, and a lot of strategy goes in to each deck and each game. For those that don't like the game, you're welcome to send your cards my way, as I'm always looking to fatten my collection up a bit.</div></div><hr />

A bright LON&lt;lon&gt; needs to come up by your name like an &lt;afk&gt; AFK if you have it open!&lt;/afk&gt;&lt;/lon&gt;</div></div><hr />

Or find more responsible raiders. Don't blame LoN for your member's lack of dedication. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madie of Wind Riders</div><div class="date">09-27-2007, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I have never played a card game like this before I was intrigued. I went through the entire tutorial and found it extremely confusing and really annoying. I personally have no desire to play it and I too am disappointed that there will be items I wont be able to get because I don't play. :ohwell:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">09-27-2007, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played M:TG in the past, and it was enjoyable enough, but personally not at all interested in a digital card game within my mmorpg.  It's disappointing that there will be some prizes I'll never see, but I think resources might have been better used towards fixing some bugs that have gone on forever (ie, pathing, west bug, etc).<br />
<br />
LoN will be popular though and really, instead of incorporating it into EQ, I wonder if it could have been created and marketed as a separate tack-on to a Station account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">09-28-2007, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds a bit like the WoW collectible card game?  A game on its own, but with bonus items that appear on &quot;loot cards&quot;? For example in WoW you can get a noncombat pet, a unique baby turtle mount, etc. I think it's 99% useless &quot;pretty stuff&quot; that won't actually affect the game.<br />
<br />
If that's the case I don't care for it, in either game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">09-28-2007, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The loot cards in EQ are &quot;pretty stuff&quot;, but besides the weapon graphic cards they do affect the game. Mounts are AA horse speed, familiars have different things (resists, DSes, etc), illusions have different things (banshees are a DS, not sure about the others), items that are similiar to staunch recovery and a hatred reducer, and you can get 10K refiller hp/mana potions and exp potions. That last one affects the game in a big way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadwen</div><div class="date">09-28-2007, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasnt really including the loot stuff from the ccg, but I think all of that stuff is adding more dynamism to the EQ game. It just allows people to further customize themselves.... However I think that SOE should allow people to acquire these items in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">10-03-2007, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I heard they were adding Legends of Norrath as a seperate game I was so so. When I heard they were going to make it so packs drop in game I started laughing. I don't see much point than to try it out with the starters and stuff they give you, it could be good. While, I do not play Everquest now, all it seems to be is just something to do farm packs to sell in bazaar if you choose not to play the game or just want the additional items. I feel sorry for the pure melee classes that will end up with the mana recovery item.<br />
<br />
The other thing I thought of was old showeq, and how I heard it shows the loot tables on mobs currently up in the zone. So, I figured good luck finding those mobs with packs, someone will exploit it and cruise around zones in search of packs to sell in bazaar and the plat selling market. Those guys really used to annoy me, warping on some named mob I was chasing down at the time.<br />
<br />
I feel it was completely unnecessary for the in game loots and should be treated as a seperate game entirely. So, I would ask what would bring me back to the game, as well as other players and attract new players as well. I don't think it would, but, good solid gameplatability with newer expansions would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladred</div><div class="date">10-03-2007, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were no extra resources used for the LoN development. The team that was brought over from worlds apart modified the auto assault ccg. They tweaked to norrath and changed some game play mechanics that were a little sour from the auto assault version.<br />
<br />
The game plays really well, very challenging. Last night I unveiled my newest deck and I tore through about six opponents in a row. Stopped to watch house, came back and got pwned about ten times in a row. Some really funky decks being created out there.<br />
<br />
This one lock down deck had me twiddling my thumbs for about 15 minutes. I couldn't attack, I couldn't deal damage, I couldn't do anything except sit there while he completed quests. It was annoying, but it fueled conversation, heh.</div></div><hr />
