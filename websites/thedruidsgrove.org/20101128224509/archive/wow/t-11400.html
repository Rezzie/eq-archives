<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWK</div><div class="date">12-19-2006, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I'm sure many of you are, I have been PvPing with the goal of obtaining as many pieces of the FM/HWL armor set.  I have now accumulated over 22K honor and have 40+ of each marker.  Currently, I'm in full FeralHeart (Rings, Trinkets, neck are not an issue in any form) and Would like to begin to replace each piece.<br />
<br />
I was looking for some feedback as to the order most druids would replace.  I have been leaning towards<br />
<br />
Legs&gt;Helm&gt;Chest&gt;Shoulders&gt;Boots&gt;Gloves<br />
<br />
My initial thinking was to replace gear that could be enchanted/libramed with HP.  I was speaking with another Druid and he said that there was no way he would enchant with HP but instead go Agility on Helm, Legs, Boots and Gloves, and +4 Stats on Chest.<br />
<br />
This brings up my 2nd question.  At this level of gear, do you see a better return on STA or AGIL.  I have long left my raiding guild and amongst my real life friends I play druid exclussively so that I can always fill the roll that is missing.  I do Tank, I do DPS...and yes I do have to Main heal (a lot).<br />
<br />
I was never much of a PvP person until the last few weeks.  I have discovered that even though Feralheart is a great Utility set in a PvE environment, in BGs there are certain classes that can absolutely demolish my Health pool in a very short time.<br />
<br />
I'm never going to be #1 in DPS, but I do know that Agil can assist in Armor, Crit and Dodge.  What I don't know is if I want to go that route over pure Stamina.  Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

The breastplate, hat, and hands there's no competition for, so there's your 3 piece bonus.  With the recent bump to armor on the epics, the boots are now, I think, clearly better than the AB boots, but if you can't do better than the defiler's belt, you may want those boots anyway for the +run speed and 3 piece +1% crit set bonus.<br />
<br />
The shoulders are a hybrid piece with all 5 stats and a SP bonus, whereas AB has awesome leather shoulders for less honor that are clearly better for physical damage.  Going to go pick those up tonight and finally ditch my freaking Atal'ai Spaulders.<br />
<br />
It's also a toss-up as to whether the pants are better than the WSG pants.  The rank pants give 24 STR and some int/spi, but the WSG pants have 10 more AGI, 9 more STA, and 15 more armor.  It's really a tank/dps thing, but I'd consider the Outrider ones carefully, given that they're cheaper.<br />
<br />
While I'm on the subject, don't overlook the epic bracers from WSG, they're very nice as well, and it's hard to get good feral bracers.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you go with the rank pants, and you're looking at a potential 6/6 bonus for the rank set, then it's a lot closer between the AB and rank pieces.</div></div><hr />

Got legs the first week and should have enough points for the helm tonight. Already put the 100 HP enchant on the legs, will probably put +8 strength on the helm. As for chest, 4 to all stats is the best enchant currently available, but with the expansion coming I wouldn't spend it on this enchant just yet; there's going to be better enchants available for less costly mats.</div></div><hr />

I went with the Belt of Preserved Heads from ZG, Chitonous Shoulderguards &amp; Thick Silithid Chestguard from AQ20.  Grab the bracers and the pants from WSG (get the druid pants.  the rogue ones aren't worth the sacrifice in secondary stats.  no need to be one-dimensional).  <br />
<br />
That leaves gloves, helm, and boots from the General's/Warlord's set.  This gets you the speed bonus and the 20 stam bonus.  Nice =]<br />
<br />
Grab the Amulet of the Darkmoon for a nice solid neck (or the ZG neck if you're exalted)  Throw on a ZHM and a couple PvP rings and you're looking at a solid set.<br />
<br />
Granted, this is much easier to pull off when you have a Mace of Unending Life.  But even with a Warden Staff, this set comes out pretty wicked, offering you more than just a little survivability.  You can use rings, trinkets, and cloak to change from bear to cat (stam to attack pwr/agi/str).<br />
<br />
As for enchants?  Honestly, I have stam on boots, agi on gloves, dodge on helm, stealth on cloak, HP on chest, (here i cheat) stam/str on bracers.  Yes, I bought two pairs and gave them different enchants.  I also put the +30 attack power on the shoulders.  I put str on my one hander and my Warden Staff has agi.<br />
<br />
I find that I have a ton of viability in this set.  I can deal a great deal of damage, run flags, soak up damage in bear form. . . very multi-faceted.  I even have some mana to heal a few times.</div></div><hr />

Nice to see you on the forums =D.  I remember the days of spec'ing feral.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
Soon I will be back.....Yes, yes I will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man, I just got the waiver to spec feral from my guild.  To be honest though, I miss the crap outta swiftmend.  That was sick for never dying.<br />
<br />
Its too bad we can't have cross faction arena teams :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">12-19-2006, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol. I spec'ed feral at first (2.0) and missed swiftmend and didn't like dying. Spec'ed back RestoPvP until xpac=/<br />
<br />
Anywho. I'm gettting EpicChest first...Not sure what to get afterwards...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A handfull of the best pvp'ers from each faction would be awesome on a team together.  I could actually not be the taget of Krylencelo &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
For a chest piece I actually hope to pick up Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark, but only time will tell if that will happen.</div></div><hr />
