When I compare my pally with my druid the spell vs healing is not making sense to me.  <br />
<br />
On my pally I have more healing power and dont see any talent that boosts the +healing ... and on my druid the spell and healing power are the same.  I only got to heal a couple of AVs last night and didnt notice anything different, I was still at the top in healing but I respec to dreamstate just for fun till expac...<br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight?</div></div><hr />

So, you may have +600 heal on your druid and +1200 heal on your pally, but their effective healing maybe be identical (assuming similar level gear).<br />
<br />
In short, it is now even more difficult to compare +heal and +spell between classes any more.  Futhermore, you can't compare pre-3.0 +heal to 3.0 +heal due to the major coefficient changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there supposed to be a Bonus Spellpower stat somewhere?  The only mention of it is on my gear.</div></div><hr />

When I looked at the talent page it had my old spec listed and didn't show the lvl 51 talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my druid I have 997 spell damage and 997 healing while in my pally I have 924 spell damage and 1225 healing... as I mentioned I dont see any talents boosting the + healing on the pally so my question is the healing output the same pre and post patch? <br />
<br />
Post patch my druid had 2100 +heals and the pally had +1800 so just a bit confused on where the effect has been reworked.</div></div><hr />

But i haven't ran into differences due to class that don't relate to talents. This is a tough one. As for the trainers. ...i am restraining my self from going to visit blizzard employee's. I cant train any of the new skills. Wild growth doesn't even show up in my spellbook.</div></div><hr />

I heard 1.7 (i.e.: 1.7x the current spell power number should equal your old +heal). This worked out for me.<br />
<br />
I did notice that in caster form my +spell and +heal were equal however in Tree my +heal was greater.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tree has a bonus though that only affects healing.  Its the spirit bonus so it buffs your healing but not spellpower in general.  I'm sure this is meant to be a balance so you aren't specing deep into resto to get say +300 spellpower or something like that.</div></div><hr />
