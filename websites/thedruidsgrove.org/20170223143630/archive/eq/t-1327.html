What would make it great would be.... the Druid rocks in outside zones but inside we lose alot of our spells use. Why not make an indoor only pet for us to tank a little bit? Any way post thread if there is one already on this subject.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes sense we have lots we can do so balance that with mana cost and micromanagment.<br />
<br />
With a decent set pet that could melee (though prob not defend itself all that well) it would be to easy for us, just press pet attack one per fight, and pet guard here a few times after.<br />
<br />
With charm you get more power but must use the mana and manage the pet when it wears off, etc.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if  there were more charmable animals in the game and in dungeons. Also that things that are obviously animals be marked that way. What you gonna do though. Hopefully they will sprinkle a blanced amunt of them into the game for PoP.<br />
<br />
I would rather them make our pet into more of a wizard familar with mana regen, resists, caster levels, and or some other types of AA enhancments.<br />
<br />
How about making Boo Boo forage for us? Har har.</div></div><hr />

Should last longer then wizards eye.   Pet would not draw aggro in dungeon--just like beastmaster on series can use hawk to check things out.--perfect scout</div></div><hr />

Right now his only usefull purpose IMHO is farming silk in EK.<br />
<br />
Just make em a spider and let em shoot a dozen silk an hour out of his butt. Save us all some time.</div></div><hr />
