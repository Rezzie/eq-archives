    nice. I know my heart warms abit every time you guys respond. If only it would happen more often.<br />
<br />
    I have some questions<br />
<br />
    1) When do you think you will give us a glimpse at what you are planning with itemazation?<br />
<br />
    2) Would you agree that druid have a bit too many talents, and not wnough points? That is to say, alot of things in the feral tree are aweful expensive for what they do, and some things undeniable feral are in balance and restoration.<br />
<br />
    3) Could you please make moonfury scale with gear, pretty pretty please? and maybe give balance druids a silence? They need it to stand a chance vrs casters. and it would make them more viable in several enounters you have designed. (cthun eh)<br />
<br />
    5) Rework Tree of Life. While theorycraft says this is an effective talent, alot of use are afraid it will be the new innervate. required in raids, and not fun at all.<br />
<br />
    6) Answer this question: Will druids get an epic flight form? We really dont want another gimmik spell, we really are tired of being annoying and running away.<br />
<br />
    It'd be nice to stand toe to toe with a fury warrior or warlock and win(with some healing naturally)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Hmm, tough to quantify. From my perspective, it will definitely feel &quot;soon&quot; (of course, June feels like yesterday to me right now, the weeks blaze by at blinding speed at this stage of the project), but to you &quot;soon&quot; probably means tomorrow or the next day. So, &quot;soon-ish&quot;?<br />
<br />
2. Yes, the next iteration will include some talent slimming. As far as some things that are undeniably feral that are in other trees, bear in mind that that kind of tree hybridization is exactly what a lot of you are asking for (so that spec'ing primarily in one tree doesn't gimp your hybrid capabilities).<br />
<br />
3. We're definitely looking to make sure that there is enough gear scaling. As far as giving druids a silence, I definitely can't promise that. Druids not having easy access to interrupts is one of their defining features (much like paladins not having easy access to pulling mechanics).<br />
<br />
4. Hmm, it appears you have no #4. So yes, I can totally commit to this one!<br />
<br />
5. I don't know that Tree of Life needs a &quot;rework&quot;, although that may just be a matter of semantics. I do think the move speed reduction is a bit overly restrictive right now, and we're expecting to change that in one way or another. As far as it becoming a &quot;required&quot; raid talent... definitely trying to avoid that (fortunately, there isn't much bang in having more than one tree on a raid).<br />
<br />
6. Maybe, it hasn't been ruled out. Note: that doesn't mean &quot;yes&quot;, so I don't want to hear &quot;you promised us etc etc etc&quot; next month. ;]<br />
<br />

Goa, please, tell us, if/when these changes happened and how they look like :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">10-10-2006, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The talent slimming sounds very nice -- I've hardly got enough points to fill out all the tanking talents I want. :-/<br />
<br />
About gear -- I've seen a few items from the beta -- blue weapon with +AP in forms (quest reward), some very nice feral leather pieces, a blue  allround chest (+ to all stats, and 3 sockets so you can focus it in one area), nuking leather, armour ring, etc. Given that they're far from finished with itemisation, I'd say they're on the right track seen from non-resto druids' point of view. :) Oh, and the stamina! The high stamina on expansion items makes me grin every time I think of my Heart of the Wild talent. ^^<br />
<br />
6. Maybe [druids will get an epic flight form], it hasn't been ruled out. Note: that doesn't mean &quot;yes&quot;, so I don't want to hear &quot;you promised us etc etc etc&quot; next month. ;]<br />
