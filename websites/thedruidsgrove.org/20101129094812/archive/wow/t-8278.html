Ok guys, help me out here.<br />
I'll hit 35 this morning and I need alchemy training.<br />
I have searched the forums and I see that I need to go to Feathermoon. What I don't see is how I might get there.<br />
<br />
The Doggie paddle is one obvious method, however I was hoping there may be a boat I can grab from somewhere.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions/tips/instructions on making this Trek would be most appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you do you'll find Feathermoon to the north of the northen island in Feralas. There's a boat going to the island, but you can swim if u like, usually faster. You reach Feralas from Descolace or Thousand Needles.</div></div><hr />

Can be hazardous though if travelling over land (Feralas is lvl40-50), just stay out of the forests where possible and be careful. :D</div></div><hr />

You can also just swim across, there isn't really anything dangerous in the water once you leave the coast.</div></div><hr />
