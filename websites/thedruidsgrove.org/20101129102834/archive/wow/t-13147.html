With healing split between so many spells now, I hate to use an idol that only benefits one spell.<br />
<br />
I guess I could just emphasize the spell that benefits from an idol as much as possible, but that seems awfully clunky.</div></div><hr />

Its not great, but in the big picture, most of my heals come from LB ticks.</div></div><hr />

I did some quick testing with this last night, as I was trying to determine which of the Idols available to me would be of most use.<br />
<br />
Quick'n'dirty: I took off gear then put it on to create an artifical health deficit, then cast either Rejuv or LB (single) and wrote down what it healed me.  This was repeated for each of the three Idols I have - Harold's Rejuvenating Brooch (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25643) (HRB), Idol of the Raven Goddess (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32387) (IRG) and Idol of Lush Moss (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40711) (ILM).  Then I repeated it all in Tree form.  The results are below:<br />
<br />
Spell(Idol)  .  Caster  .  Tree<br />
LB(IRG)  .  276  .  318<br />
LB(ILM)  .  290  .  333<br />
LB(HRB)  .  276  .  318<br />
<br />
RJ(IRG)   . 1400  .  1606<br />
RJ(ILM)  .  1400  .  1605<br />
RJ(HRB)  .  1443  .  1652<br />
<br />
As expected, the ILM does not affect RJ, and Harold's does not affect LB, but....  IRG affects neither.  I didn't have time to test out the full array of Resto heals, but so far I have no reason to believe that it affects any heal spell, and is broken.<br />
<br />
My recc:  for Resto, it's worthless as currently in-game.  If they do manage to fix it, it will be worth re-evaluating.<br />
<br />
For myself, I'll bank the IRG in case they ever do decide to fix it, but swap between Harold's and ILM as I feel like from fight to fight depending on my assigment and which spell I expect to be using more.  <br />
<br />
It just seems odd that a quest reward from the mid-60's is still competitive at 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed!  And the sad part is, its not because of the HRB being OP, its just that druid idols as a whole right now are garbage.  The badge idol (+65 agi proc) for ferals...yes I meant &quot;Badge&quot; not emblem is still competitive and arguably better than other idols available.  I use the PvP idol for tanking that gives +swipe/Maul dmg when tanking (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=38365).  I am considering going back to the +agi though.</div></div><hr />

I've just been using the ILM recently. the IRG does still work for Moonkin Aura and presumeably Feral aura. I guess maybe when the tree aura was changed they never bothered to make the conversion.</div></div><hr />
