<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the deal with this spawn? I've heard he has a ph so can be a random spawn and I've also heard that he's a set timed spawn (3 days like the rest?). Either way, I have not seen him since the day PoP was released when I was exploring PoI and he ate me for dinner, but I need him for his power source ;p<br />
<br />
Anyone know what the truth is surrounding this guy?</div></div><hr />
