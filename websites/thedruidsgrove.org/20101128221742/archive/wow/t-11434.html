I've run Strat DOZENS of times going for that thing....never have I seen it drop.<br />
<br />
Yes, I QQ over it =P</div></div><hr />

I've run UD countless times for it, though I dont have it yet.  I've seen it drop, though ofc I was on my priest trying to get the Crimson Felt Hat.  Then a few runs later, I take my Druid, and the Crimson Felt Hat drops.  <br />
<br />
Both of those things have been taunting me.  I've given up on the hat for my priest, but I want that stupid idol.<br />
<br />
And yeah, we can't stealth.  The UD and those bastard eyes see us &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I had farmed for it for forever(Especially since it makes a TREMENDOUS effect on tanking, and I spend almost all of my group-time tanking), but then one day I was just taking a break from UD, then decided late at night to help my guild do an all-guild 45 min UD.<br />
<br />
By chance, I won the idol and the UD run was a success. And everyone got like 6 or 7 large brilliant shards when we split the shards equally at the end. (We had done like 3 runs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">01-06-2007, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a much higher droprate than 1.4%. When new items are introduced on old mobs/bosses, thottbot, allakhazam show droprates way off target.<br />
<br />
I've run quite a bit of strat baron, and I reckon I've seen it 30-40% of the times we've killed the magistrate.<br />
<br />
Btw, even with the incoming nerf to the idol, it still rocks. That extra damage on swipe will be very useful when tanking big pulls. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">01-06-2007, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh I believe the drop rate, because in my well over a thousand times of doing ud run after that idol was introduced, I have seen it drop once, although I'm probably just unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">01-06-2007, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, stuff like that happens. :-s I still remember my endless grind (over 30 solo runs) before Hearthsinger finally decided to drop his piccolo (which has got a 15% droprate) :-P ...and the heavy dark iron ring still hadn't dropped for my guild after 6 months of weekly MC runs. (Lost my chance now, as we stopped doing MC some months back.) <br />
<br />
Sometimes I get the impression that bliz' random numbers aren't as random as they should be. :-P</div></div><hr />

Eventually I got better and said screw it.</div></div><hr />

It dropped like candy. I had a total of 7 in my bag at one time...3 in one run was the most I've gotten. But they fixed the bug that made it drop so often &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
i farmed mine by going in Scarlet side and working our way towards undead.  <br />
<br />
I was really lucky, found another druid that wanted it, a tank that wanted the gloves that are immune to disarm, and some clothies that wanted the hat.<br />
<br />
we ran it 5 straight times before the group broke up.<br />
<br />
Both of us Druids got our idols, and one Crimson hat...but Magistrate cuffs and that pole arm were a tad disappointing to see drop.<br />
<br />
On a side note, that same druid worked with me to get us both our Idol's of rejuvination.<br />
<br />
Keeping good people on the buddy list ftw.</div></div><hr />
