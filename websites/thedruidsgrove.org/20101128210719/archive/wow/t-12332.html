I think that this is a great idea, personally I like the idea of changing this into a finisher move like SaD, and I think its potential to increase our dps in raids is huge for those more geared out druids that have to go head up with the BT geared rogues.  It could also help our PvP status with interrupting cast time.  I hear all the time of higher end druids having to dump our combo points into FB or saving them for the next bleed rotation, everyone knows that when we have no bleed rotation our dps goes down a ton.  What are your thoughts?  If you are like me and like the idea, please keep this thread bumped, I would like to see some blue response to this idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-17-2008, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The existing tiger's fury is pretty good already imo.  There are 3 main times to use it.<br />
<br />
1.  Just before you ravage or pounce.<br />
<br />
2.  If you get feared or whatever, and while running back to the mob your energy gets near 100; you can usefully activate tiger's fury as a way to prevent energy ticks being &quot;wasted&quot;.<br />
<br />
3.  If you build up a large amount of energy (say whilst waiting for the tank to get 5 sunders up), and then get an OOC proc as well, it's a good idea to do a tiger's fury as this doesn't use up the OOC proc, but draws straight from your energy bar - preventing wasted ticks.  It will allow you to get up to 4 shreds in during the 6 second buff.  With the modifier being 285%, that works out as roughly 154 extra damage per shred hit, not to mention 40 extra damage with each white damage attack.  Therefore with 6 white damage attacks and 4 shreds: <br />
<br />
dmg = (6 x white damage attacks) + (4 x (white damage attacks x shred % modifier)<br />
dmg = (6 x 40) + (4 x (40 x 2.25)<br />
dmg = (6 x 40) + (4 x 90)<br />
dmg = 240 + 360<br />
dmg = 600<br />
<br />
Remember that this damage has the potential to crit as well.  If all 6 white damage attacks crit and all 4 shreds crit, it can be up to 1290 extra damage.  So depending on your crit chance you are getting 600 - 1290 damage (before mob armor) for a mere 30 energy.  It's 25% cheaper than a fully talented Mangle, and with only average crit chance it does more damage than mangle non-crits for most druids - especially druids that don't have 2/2 savage fury (such as yours truly..)<br />
<br />
At 40% crit chance, your 30 energy is granting you on average 876 damage.<br />
<br />
For lesser-geared druids this is a very nice rotation to use on bosses that are bleed immune, as you will have relatively few opportunities for an efficient ferocious bite anyway.<br />
<br />
It's also very nice for druids with extremely high crit chance, as its a good method of using your energy whilst waiting for your previous rip/mangle to wear off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite all of this, I still support your cause in a very sort of general way; buff druids more plx bliz kthx ! :&gt;<br />

I would still think that another finisher for us druids could be nice especially since we are very rarely ever in a situation were we say &quot;wow... I should use FB!&quot;  You bring good tactics to using this ability to its fullest potential at this time; I just hope to see a better use of its utility if we can change it to a finisher move, of even give us a new one for that matter.  Again this is just a ruff idea of what we can do to make it better, nothing set in stone says &quot;this is the way to go&quot;</div></div><hr />

But cats already attack very fast, so perhaps that is the reason for not giving us a slice&amp;dice type ability.<br />

Another finishing move would be very nice, though.  Perhaps we could call it Battle Purr - like an aoe tiger's fury that affects your whole party's weapon damage.  :&gt;<br />

I like this idea... but talk about OP...  Think of this, BM hunter, feral druid with this ability, enh shamy, fury warrior, MM hunter...  This group would do rape dmg if we had another way to increase someone’s weapon dmg.  Very thoughtful idea though, and its a start.<br />
<br />
As far as the SaD idea, i was thinking more of a dmg multiplier, nothing huge, but say 2% for a certin about of seconds per combo point, my point was to show that SaD was a good start to develop this idea, yes it should be its own unique ability and not TF.  So maybe the idea will be like this:<br />
<br />
Lions Fury:  Per combo point increase melee dmg output by 2%per combo point for a certin about of sec's:<br />
<br />
1 combo point:  2% melee dmg increase, last 9 sec's<br />
2 combo point:  4% melee dmg increase, last 12 sec's<br />
3 combo point:  6% melee dmg increase, last 15 sec's<br />
4 combo point:  9% melee dmg increase, last 18 sec's<br />
5 combo point:  12% melee dmg increase, last 21 sec's<br />
<br />
This seems to be a very small increase in dps but it could be a huge increase to those more geared out in raid status, this would be a true scalable finishing move.  It would also give use a good way to dump our points if the mob is not bleed able.  On top of that with a good group synergy you can make a huge impact on your dps output waiting for your bleed rotation to come up.  <br />
<br />
Please help me throw some idea's around, i think its best that we come up with something now that blizzard might look into to help us scale better in end game content, and give us more variability with un-bleed able bosses.</div></div><hr />
