all i can see is &quot;PAWNAGE&quot;.<br />
<br />
Savage Roar is my nr. 1 finisher for leveling now.<br />
+40% attack-power OMG.<br />
I'm running arround with over 6k attack-power all the time.<br />
the buff lasts 34 secs (5pts) and im critting for almost 900 white-damage :grin: <br />
<br />
And with my nr. 1 leveling trinket silvercross (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32770)<br />
i have an AP boost almost 100% of the time on me.<br />
This is soooo huge.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what do you think about the new ability??</div></div><hr />

<br />
although someone i know is 79 ! lol he needs a life ! his other half said he had about 6 hrs sleep between the release of Wrath at midnight and yesterday afternoon.<br />
<br />
and he's taken a week off work to level ! and he's online now !<br />
<br />
I hit 71 yesterday afternoon !<br />
<br />
That's an old trinket available in BC yes ?</div></div><hr />

It was kind of funny when i was in an instance with him at saturday night and he fell asleep during a boss-fight ;-)<br />
<br />
I think 50% of my guild is between 75-78 right now.<br />
Im hitting 76 today at aprox 23:00 :-)<br />
<br />
But now my progress will slow down cause i only got 3 days from my girlfriend to do extreme-gaming ;-)<br />
Now the time is hers again! (except the 3 normal raid-days).<br />
<br />
My goal is dinging 80 at the end of the week or in the middle of the next week.<br />
<br />
@Kheldar: yes it's the reputation trinket for exaltet with the shatari skyguard. there is also an equivalent trinket which boosts spelldamage (+80) instead of AP(+140).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best I could do was to hit 72.5 this weekend, but we did have at least two people hit 80 saturday evening.  The first person on our server was a druid!  <br />
<br />
There was sever wide &quot;Achievement&quot; announcement for the first of each class to hit 80.  Druid, then a mage about 20 mins later.  Those are the only two I saw. <br />
<br />
Add that to the list of acheivements NOT to be proud of.  Yikes!</div></div><hr />

+40% attack-power OMG.Why use it during leveling?  Seems like a mob would be dead by the time you'd gain the benefit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cause i dont need a finisher for mobs. 2-3 mangle are enough to bring the mob down. then i use SR (if not at 5 cpts 1 extra rake).<br />
So the buff never goes away. It's 34 sec.<br />
In every killing quest i have it up all the time.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just the excitement for the new ability, but i like it during grinding.<br />
And it seems to me, that i have more energy to spare if i pawn down several mobs in a row.<br />
Cause when mobs are near im not always full energy when coming to the next one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That make sense.<br />
<br />
Do you use rake in your questing rotation?  Or just mangle?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally I would say the benefit on mobs B &amp; C would be lost because of travel distance etc.  But with the crazy close proximity of mobs and the fast respawn times, I am often fighting 3-4 mobs in a row if not at one time. <br />
<br />
I normally open with Rake if I am not stealthed, and then just mangle, mangle, (depending on energy mangle again) Fer. Bite....Loot, skin, rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normaly i use Mangle, Rake, Mangle, Mangle, SR (if i fight several mobs in short time, else FB)<br />
But if the mobs are a little spred and i can asume that i have almost 100% energy on each mob, then i almost always go stealth-&gt;pounce-&gt;mangle-&gt;shred-&gt;FB. takes almost every mob down.</div></div><hr />

#showtooltip<br />
/cast [nocombat][modifier:ctrl] Feral Charge - Cat;Tiger's Fury<br />
<br />
I'm gonna do something similar...untested...<br />
<br />
/use [combat] 13<br />
/use [combat] 14<br />
/cast [nocombat] Feral Charge - Cat;Tiger's Fury<br />
<br />
If that works, when I'm in combat I'd use my trinkets (if not on cooldown) then cast TF.</div></div><hr />
