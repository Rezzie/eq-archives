<br />
What if this was implemented in EQ as a Cleric MEZ ability ? It could give clerics a decent non Healing role as CC . There are only 2 classes currently that can Mez . With 3 Healers , 3 tanks ,3 slowers and a SLEW of pure DPS I see no reson why there shouldnt be a third CC option via mez ..<br />
<br />
Thoughts ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
After all, they share the pac line with Enchanters, and the ability to call down the wrath of a cleric's god to immobilize has a long and rich history in both D&amp;D and literature.<br />
<br />
Giving Clerics a low-resist, moderate duration, unbreakable root (&quot;hold person&quot;) would be an excellent way to introduce desirability into the Cleric class that they'll need when the healing balancing is enacted.  But, since the mob is immobilized via a &quot;mez&quot; style spell, then any attack should break the spell just as any hit can break a mez.<br />
<br />
I personally like this idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on the CC abilities -v- the solo abilities on offer.<br />
<br />
But if I had the choice between being able to mezz like an enchanter or solo like a necro, it's a no-brainer.  :)  Mezz plz!  Mezzing is fun, soloing is dull.<br />
<br />
I don't think clerics are going to end up being able to mezz like an enchanter, though - I fear that idea would be more than a little unbalanced.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um ... I might be able to buy into this.  I hate adding an ability from a non priest class, but wouldn't mind (at all) a cleric being able to mezz a mob.<br />
<br />
But how would that affect enchanters, necros, and bards?<br />
<br />
not if you make it inefficient for it to be their primary role. via either higher costs or longer recasts.<br />
<br />
Would definitely need to be inefficient compared to the others.  <br />
<br />
I'd also still like to see the cleric nuke line improved so it isn't resisted as much and is a viable use in groups at the least.  Although, if a cleric is able to channel a nuke through while meleeing, wouldn't that help those who want to be able to solo by melee?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Necros, hardly at all at level 65.  Necros don't mezz much at 65 anyway.  If a necro wants to deal with an add, she can kite it.  Or just kill it.<br />
<br />
The other two classes might very well have issues with the idea, and I can't say I'd blame them.  I wouldn't be overly enthusiastic about enchanters asking to be able to CH.</div></div><hr />

(I'm amazed with bards and think very highly of them.  They do so much so well and bring an amazing bunch of abilities to a group, besides their solo abilities.  I miss our guild bard and his crowd control tremendously :( )</div></div><hr />

Seems to me that with the ability of clerics to call upon a diety for assistance, said diety should be able to make a clerics enemy witless for a bit.  &quot;Holy light from heaven holds a target in thrall, consumed by holy terror&quot; or some such thing.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dadalan Lyfrender</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of a hold mob spell. Maybe to help keep balance and keep the classes that can already do it happy, make it more of a unresistable root. Touch the mob (or do any damage at all.... i.e. dot's) and it breaks, but get close to the mob and it can still hit you (unlike a true mez). Have it last for 24 seconds so that you couldn't hold a mob while you camp out safely. Give it a 18 second recast time so that you can only hold 1 mob at a time, but gives you enough time to cast it on the mob again to start the 24 second timer again (i.e. the first mob isn't dead yet). Level of mob limit would have to be worked out unless they could flag certain mobs un-clericmezable... i.e. Vindi and his 2 guards, you couldn't Hold Mob on the 2 guards while you single pulled Vindi, etc.<br />
<br />
I already use my direct heals to pull adds off the tank in LDoN's and then root them off to the side. But it usually breaks fast or gets resisted, so the wizzy's or other classes will end up overwriting my root so that the tactic works. Would be nice to be able to handle it myself without having to have another class stop what they are doing to help me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dadalan, just a small point - with your 18/24 scheme, you could easily have two clerics pull &quot;guard mobs&quot; off to the far end of a dungeon/platform/where ever and constantly them while a guild takes out the main mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's surmountable, you could say that if the mob's flagged unmezzable this new spell wouldn't work on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">06-16-2004, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thinking about this some more.  The answer doesn't have to be cleric mezz per se - you could achieve reasonable cleric CC without adding a new spell line or creating new capabilities.  You just need to muck around with the existing cleric spell lines.<br />
<br />
Start by giving paci a seriously increased duration and you can use it almost like a mezz... repacify before the last paci wears off and the mob won't attack unless you get close enough for it to hit you.  The only thing preventing that at the moment is the 42 second duration on pacify.<br />
<br />
You could also add in a (fixed) version of Atone which (a) works most of the time instead of needing to be recast six or seven times and (b) gives a success/fail message (the fact that you don't know if Atone's worked or not has bugged me since Kunark).<br />
<br />
Between Paci, Atone, stuns and root, you have the beginnings of some crowd control tools that don't tread too heavily on enchanter/bard toes.</div></div><hr />

And duration either increased or made to last closer to their full duration.<br />
<br />
For example, I was on a CR in Kael and a DB giant aggro'ed me (arena yard trash not anything special). I cast Greater Immobilize on it 8 times. Out of those 8 casts: 5 were resisted, 1 landed and immediately broke, 1 landed and broke 3 seconds later, and 1 landed and broke 10 seconds later. For a spell that's said to last 60 seconds... 10 max on 8 casts is pretty lame, and it's a level 62 cleric spell.<br />
<br />
But yes we do have the spells... but their usefulness needs to be augmented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our root line is pretty decent, I don't think we need a lot of help there.  Root is just a pain because for it to be effective, you have to root them away from your party / raid.  When it breaks, the cast time doesn't allow you to keep them in one spot.  I would love to see a message, even if &quot;cryptic&quot; that warns you root is going to break so you can re-do it (by cryptic I mean not in bold yellow like the worn off messages are by default or whatever.)  Or, just make cleric and druid roots set duration -- can be resisted, but if not it will be rooted for X time, and only knockback can break root (so any nuke with zero knockback won't break root, keeping druids &gt; clerics in the root / nuke game as it should be, and making melee very likely to break root, as it should be.)<br />
<br />
Actually, the spell I'd like to see?  Silence.  Make it so the debuffed mob can't cast or proc.  Make it resistable, with no resist mod, so that big raid targets are not likely to be silenced easily.  Make some immune to silence entirely.  Example:  Carprin Cycle, silencable if they are way debuffed.  Bertox, not silencable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins were given this spell some time ago, and its effect was deemed to be game breaking, so it was changed from a silence spell to a mana sieve.  I believe SoE was grasping at something to give paladins a raid role.  The spell, Thunder of Karana, was changed from a silence to a mana sieve (75 mana to cast and drained 100 mana from the mob, I think) with the promise that it would be re-evaluated &quot;soon&quot; to something useful.  That &quot;soon&quot; was a long time ago and I think the last time we got an official reply on the subject, we were told that it would not be changed from the mana sieve to anything else.<br />
<br />
So if anyone gets a reworked silence, shouldn't it be Paladins?<br />

<br />
The key here is to come up with new cleric abilities that keep them in demand if/when druids' healing skills are upgraded to be able to heal very, very close to a cleric.<br />
<br />
The 18/24 idea is a very good one, but it should truly put a mob out of action via mez, be classified as a mez for spell engine determination, but act more like a STUN, which is already a cleric ability.  Just flag the spell as a mez, so unmezzable mobs can't be held.  Also set it so mobs that can't be stunned (giants for example) get a chance to break the spell just like a root, which can be lowered by debuffing the mob's resists (such as Malos can make normal root hold longer by lowering the chance of an early break).<br />
<br />
This introduces a weakness in the spell that solidifies its role as &quot;3rd best&quot;<br />
 in SoE's concept of the class ability triumvirate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The purpose of Thunder of Karana, the silence spell, was to give paladins raid desirability, a role we are still searching for.  I am just saying that if they have given it to paladins, then taken it away, then give it back to another class, there will be some rather upset people.<br />

<br />
As far as silence goes, I see no reason why they took it out.  They could set the spell line on the slow mitigation table and apply mitigation to casting time and proc rate.  Any mob that mitigates slow mitigates this spell, thusly:<br />
<br />
No mitigation = silence (no casting) and proc rate percentage reduced 50%<br />
&quot;mostly&quot; mitigation = 75% increase to casting time and proc rate percentage reduced 50%<br />
&quot;partially&quot; mitigation = 50% increase to casting time and proc rate percentage reduced 25%<br />
&quot;slightly&quot; mitigation = 25% increase to casting time and proc rate percentage reduced 10%<br />
<br />
Now paladins can feel the love of knowing what it's like to be mitigated.  ;)</div></div><hr />

As for the guy that ask for paci to get longer duration well only 4 months Ago (or about that) SoE cut down Paci duration since they thought it alow for to much content skiping and other kinds of game balanceing issues.. so again Not going to happen.<br />

<br />
More realistically, it could be worth pursuing upgrades to the Pacification line at high levels (as in, duration 5 minutes not 42 seconds, and look at the mana cost), fixing Atone, and adding a boosted root.<br />
<br />
The result is somewhat better cleric CC without getting silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murtak</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could see a long duration high level pacify with a large mana cost. The main issue with pacify was skipping content and making single pulls too easy. Well, single pulls in GoD are already pretty easy in way too many zones and content skipping can be adressed by mana cost.<br />
<br />
Sounds good to me. What would that spell need? affects up to lvl 67? Duration 5 min+?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The present Pacification spell costs 300 mana, affects critters up to level 65, and lasts 42 seconds.  The OoW spell is the same, but it affects critters up to level 70 and costs 450 mana.  (Yeah, 450 mana for a 42 second pacify on a single critter.  Translation:  &quot;I didn't know how much mana this ought to cost so I've just pulled some number out of my ass.&quot;)<br />
<br />
Either Paci needs the mana cost keeping the same and a 5 min duration, or preferably, make it last 2 mins and reduce the mana cost accordingly.<br />
<br />
By itself that isn't sufficient.  We'd also need Atone to be fixed (so we could deal with wanderers as well as static spawns; the technique would be root, then pacify, then atone.  Assuming root wears off within the duration of the paci, the mob would just wander off again rather than adding.)<br />
<br />
If I were a Dev looking for AA ideas for clerics, if that idea gets implemented, I might consider adding a cleric class AA to reduces the chances of aggro on a paci resist, or an AA to increase the chances of Atone working successfully.<br />
<br />
But Atone needs fixing before that can be done.  Right now, the spell's worthless for two reasons.  First, it doesn't tell you whether it's succeeded or failed (and sometimes there's just no way to tell); and second, it takes six or seven casts on average before it works.  I'd have no problem with Atone having the same kind of failure rate as Pacification, but the present situation's unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

Also mez aggro is pretty high, so, on a resist, i would have to deal with the mob beating on me.<br />
<br />
So i would have a mez that keeps one mob mezzed about 70% of the time, if i'm lucky, and beating on me 30% of the time.<br />

And clerics.  We are miffed enough that paladins, a hybrid, stun better than us but have let that go.  If they give paladins silence, and not clerics, I will quit -- hybrids should not have &quot;better&quot; spells than the caster they are based on (though, in the case of Beastlords, SoE apparently does not agree with me /grr)  I would not mind at all seeing paladins get this, and I like the mitigation idea posted above, but Clerics should get it at lower levels and eventually have a more powerful version than paladins ever get.<br />

EDIT:  SYNAPTICUS!!  What's happenin there guy!</div></div><hr />

But the $100 question.  If these changes went in would clerics be happy as CC/backup healer with a druid main healing if there was no chanter/bard in the group?</div></div><hr />

I am overjoyed when I am in a group and get to use more than 2 spell slots for anything other than heals or DA.  My normal lineup is CH, Yaulp6, SR, SE, SL, 2 slots (generally root, nuke or mor, nuke or stun, nuke), and DB.  On raids, I get one slot for non-heals/da/db -- usually condemnation, or MoR on long luclin fights.<br />
<br />
When I get to do a group with SL, Yaulp6, SR, 4 slots, DA -- that is where I can &quot;shine&quot; with my knowledge of the other tools at my disposal.  Things like root CC, then using tarnation to blast the mob away from the group when it breaks and re-rooting while stunned.  Or loading up 4 stuns and stun / HoT tanking an add that won't stay rooted.  <br />
<br />
Not that I don't have fun in challenging healing situations (Doomfire, Hard LDoN, etc -- I'm in high luclin / some VT gear, GoD is / was largely too much for me to handle at times), but sometimes I like using a variety of my other tools, which you simply can't do when playing main healer.  <br />
<br />
One of the main reasons I still do normal LDoN or enjoy helping on VT Shard hunts or Ssra farming -- I get to step outside the box.</div></div><hr />

I disagree with that. Hybrids should not have spells that exceed their parent class specialities.<br />
<br />
Thus I have no issues with beastlord mana regeneration buffs or even if they get bigger better and faster nukes then mine.<br />
<br />
I do care them being being better at stat/AC/HP/resist buffing then shaman because that has always been descripted as a shaman speciality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mobutu</div><div class="date">06-17-2004, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll concede that -- I should have specified that IN THIS CASE, I don't think Paladins should get Silence / &quot;Spell Slow&quot; and not clerics, and if they implement this, we should have the better version.  Clerics are casters, and this certainly would be more fitting on a cleric but paladins could certainly benefit from it as well.  <br />
<br />
Paladins having better stuns that us was a slap at first but makes sense now.  Their superior vs. undead AA's and procs are understandable.  In regards to a &quot;silence&quot; or &quot;antimagic&quot; ability, clerics should be superior.</div></div><hr />
