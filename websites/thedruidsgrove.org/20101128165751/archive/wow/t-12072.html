<br />
is it enough to just have the reagent (maple seed, at my level) in one of my bags, or do i have to put the reagent on the toolbar and click it?  <br />
<br />
and in what order do i click things?  the rebirth button first, then the target i want to rez?  or other way around?  (and if the answer to the first question was that i have to click the reagent, when do i do that?).<br />
<br />
thank you so much for any suggestions, this seems like a useful spell, but i am getting nothing out of it as yet.</div></div><hr />

The reagent just has to be in one of your bags, no clicking on it needed.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you have the correct reagent? Every new level of the spell uses another one. Also make sure to be in range.<br />
And the target needs to be dead, maybe you tried it on a hunter who feigned death?</div></div><hr />

Mouse over their body and see if it says &quot;Resurrectable&quot;</div></div><hr />

In that state they aren't fully dead and can't be resurrected, but can be after they fully die. I've shifted out of forms many times trying to res my priest, only to have to stall for 15 seconds until she's truly dead. This talent may not be present at your level though. It's tier 5 in the Holy tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can rez after they've released?  Sometimes I will literally be standing on a body trying to rez it, and nothing.  I figured it was because they had released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I am Main Healer in a PuG with no other healing classes, I make certain that they know the deal (feral) and they must accept my rez limitations.<br />
<br />
Same goes for Tranquility.  Although cooldown isn't as bad as rebirth, I still try my hardest to save it for bosses.</div></div><hr />

Rebirth is wonderful...BUT...personally, I hate having to use it.  I covet it so much because of it's cooldown time.I don't see it as much of an issue.  As 90% of the time in PvE it is either success or a wipe.  <br />
<br />
That said, in normal 5-mans once in a great while one person might die and you don't wipe.  But it is rare.  In Heroic 5-mans, it is probably not possible to survive most encounters with just 4.  In a RAID, there will be other classes than can rez the occasional 1-2 dead folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">10-12-2007, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't the whole point of having an in-combat rez so that you don't have to finish a fight with just four? I've seen many times that a druid's Rebirth has saved my group from what would certainly have been a wipe otherwise. My biggest problem is that I can't shed aggro for long enough to shift into caster form to do it. At least there's barkskin :thumbsup:<br />
<br />
An OOC rez would be wonderful, even if it were the 51 point Resto talent, but after three years I just don't see Blizzard giving it to us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember back preTBC one of the CMs said they had no plans whatsoever to add an OOC rez for druids but as the talent trees get deeper and deeper, I don't see why not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrækLord</div><div class="date">10-14-2007, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, too, think they should add an OOC res in the Resto tree. Even if they made it come with the ToL and only castable in ToL would be better than nothing. It's so annoying when I'm main healing PuGs and I can only res one person every 30 min. =/<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Of crouse, Rebirth has it's lovely moments. Like if you're in a group without a Lock or Self-Res Shaman, and the resser dies and it looks like you're gonna wipe, you can res the resser, the resser waits until everyone's dead and the mobs are gone, and then they ressurect. Then they can res everyone else. It's a fun spell even if it's kind of annoying. =P</div></div><hr />
