<br />
I wonder if someone knows of a viable way to farm money as a Druid. There are several known places to farm money: Tyr's Hand, Azshara Satyrs, Felwood (Water Essences), Silithius (Wind Essences) to mention some of them.<br />
But since we're the lowest (besides Holy Paladin, maybe) DPS Class in the game, those places are very uneffective to farm as a Druid. Especially because I'm in a MC-farming guild, so I can't specc to Feral or Balance and have to stick to Innervate.<br />
But maybe someone here knows a good farming spot for druids. I'm thinking of instance bosses, hard elite monsters or something.<br />
Equip/Level requirements shouldn't be the problem.</div></div><hr />

I'm 36, so I can't pretend to know how well the Druid functions at that level.<br />
Can't you moonfire/Fariefire/bearform-melee two mobs at a time? I do that now and it is the only way to keep me insane and leveling.<br />
<br />
I skin and gather herbs for professions and sell it all to the merchants. Herbs certainly don't bring in the cash from merchants, so maybe I will look into selling at AH. It's just a hassle, and if it doesn't sell, then I lose my deposit.<br />
Skinning is good though. Farming Yeti's is the best, since they drop coins and skin. There are low/mid level 50's Yeti in Winterspring.<br />
<br />
I'm working Felwood now with my hunter, and I have not encountered Water Essences. What are they dropping that is profitable?</div></div><hr />

On at least two of the servers, horde has a surplus of Tauren herbalists.  I get cash by farming instances around 10-15 levels below my current level (i.e. Stockades at 40, scarlet/uldaman at 50).  Check your AH prices before you go and remember that a stack of mageweave may sell for more than a &quot;XXX bracer of the whale&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well, of course a Druid can kill his enemies and sometimes even deal with two, but this isnt really an advantage. in the farming places i mentioned, the only thing that counts is DPS (and downtimes). <br />
yesterday i tried tyrs hand again. it was kind of embarassing. i was fighting against one of these mage mobs and got him to 20% with cat form (cat form is the onliest way to do any damage without high downtimes), then another pala mob came and outhealed my damage on the mage. when the mob was 50% and i began to think about fleeing, a horde rogue (im alliance) came to help me. it took maybe 10-15 secs and he got him down.<br />
the priest mobs are unbeatable as well, because they outheal our damage, while rogues do more than double damage and can interrupt their healing.<br />
even some bossmobs that seem to be only beatable by druids due to the mobs high damage can be beaten by rogues with their dodge skill as well. and they can do this MUCH faster.<br />
<br />
well, i gave up playing druid as a farming character. i just started a rogue with herbalism/mining. but of course will i keep playing druid as my mainchar ^^.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anomaly</div><div class="date">08-03-2005, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yes, mobs that heal themselves. Pain in the butt. As a 36, I have not encountered many. Sounds like at the higher levels they will be a challenge and an annoyance. Being a low DPS class can really suck sometimes.<br />
My only encounter so far with mobs that heal themselves were these satyre demons in aschenvale. In bear form, I basically saved rage and timed my Bash stun so that I used it right before they would heal or during their cast, then unleash a Maul, and if necessary shift to moonfire. <br />
I am certain at your level they wont be as easy at that.<br />
I don't use the cat form except to prowl, so I am not sure if it has a stun. All mobs are predictable once you get to know them. They will cast their heal at the same time/HP level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawdawg</div><div class="date">08-04-2005, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh, druids need to pick their spots, because some mobs we are good against some not.  Also, we aren't great mob grinders, our strength is our versatility but not our overwhelming power in one area.  So accept that you aren't going to grind as well as rogue or mage aoeing.  I'm resto specced, lvl 60 and this is what I've found.<br />
<br />
1)  Can't fight healing mobs effectively, don't bother.<br />
2)  I use caster form with Omen of Clarity to cast regrowth every so often.  This combo allows me to start with starfire, moonfire and faerie fire and then melee them.  Whenever OoC procs I cast regrowth.  When moonfire wears off I cast it again.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
3)  Though killing the mob is slow, between innervate and OoM healing I never have any downtime between mobs.  That is where I gain some efficiency.<br />
4)  At lvl 60, I find that I can grind the toxic horror's (Felwood) pretty well because they don't do tons of damage and I can remove their poison easily.  I have grinded alongside warriors, rogues and mages and they are way faster in killing a monster but normally I catch up to them after a few because of the 0 downtime.  They eventuall have to drink or eat or whatever.<br />
<br />
If you really want to make money as a druid, hit high-level instances or use a profession.  We are very good at herb gathering as we have stealth and can pick up herbs in cheetah form.</div></div><hr />

Fairbanks dropped three BoE greens, and you could make 15g per hour farming him. Now, he only drops 1 BoP green, I think. Lame :(<br />
<br />
Aside from that, I know that Tyr's Hand and the ghosts in Azshara make for good farming. Another way that I know of, and this differs depending on demand, is devilsaur leggings and gauntlets. On my server, the leggings sell for 80-100g, and it takes maybe 3 hours to farm up 14 devilsaur leather in Un'Goro if no one else is farming them as well. It might even take less time than that, but I spent a lot of time looking for the bastards. This is, of course, only open for tribal leatherworkers, unless you're close friends with one and want to duo the devilsaurs and split the profit. But I've found it to be a very nice money maker, and it feels good to make cash off our class' incredible ability to solo hard hitting elites.</div></div><hr />

In addition, they nerfed the chest spawn in Cath as well.  Kind of weird since Armory and GY still have 1, and Lib still has 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though it's pretty cliche as a Tauren Druid, I went Hebalism/Alchemy and I've been making a lot of money doing that.<br />
<br />
I can either sell the herbs I farm or I can sell pots for a pretty good profit. Elixir of Greater Defense sells for 10g per stack of 5 on my server. Just under an hour of fishing/farming earns me about 20g with just those pots alone. Elixir of the Mongoose and a couple of other potions are easy to make as well, and sell very well.<br />
<br />
As far as farming by killing mobs? Pretty slow.<br />
<br />
Most of the farmed mobs you have referred to are camped 24/7 by both factions, especially the Toxic Horrors in Felwood. It's virtually impossible on my server (PvP) to farm the Toxic Horrors in Felwood because not only do I have to deal with Alliance players and Chinese Farmers, I'm also competing with my own faction for them, even during off-peak hours.</div></div><hr />

Just curious.<br />
<br />
I have heard that for upper level 30's and lower 40's that the cemetary in SM is good for grinding xp and money. But, which mobs there? I went yesterday and died at the hands of some mob that seemed to triplicate himself or something. Otherwise, I did find I can bear form 3 ghosts at a time and they drop 2-5 silver a piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SM graveyard is where you want to be, and by your description of the mob you had issues with, you were in the correct spot.<br />
<br />
For the mob that spawns the apparition(s), go bear form and save up 15-20 rage depending on your talents.  Right when the mob finishes casting the spell (you can tell by the summoning animation), hit swipe.  You will kill the add in one hit every time without ever changing targets.  Just remember to keep at least 15-20 rage and you will be fine.<br />
<br />
For the apparitions that come in groups of 3, I like to use swipe again.  In order to keep the rage building as fast as possible, I try to keep all three mobs alive until the very end.  I will work on one mob til its down to 15ish%, change targets to the next mob til its down to 10ish%, then target the last mob til its dead, all the while swiping as soon as I have the rage.  With a regrowth to start the fight, I may end up low to half health, but its a fast kill and an easy way to manage all three at once especially since they are not elite.  These 3-groups seemed to me to be the easiest to kill and have a good chance at dropping greens.<br />
<br />
Farm SM on rested xp and you will get both good grinding xp as well as good drops to sell for mount cash.  <br />
<br />
Just my tidbit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't really, it's just a commonly accepted term.<br />
<br />
The &quot;companies&quot; who sell WoW gold on e-bay, etc. are usually based in China, and they usually &quot;hire&quot; the &quot;players&quot; who farm for gold from their home country.<br />
<br />
You can spot a Chinese Farmer by the following:<br />
<br />
1. Crappy Gear (at Level 60 they have all-greens or worse).<br />
2. Poor PvP skills.<br />
3. Usually a Rogue or Hunter (Fast killing, good solo classes).<br />
4. No matter when you go there, they are ALWAYS in the same place killing THE SAME mobs.<br />
5. Bad English.<br />
6. Will sometimes have an Oriental-sounding name, like Mitsumi, etc.<br />
<br />
*Of course 1 and 5 I can't usually tell since I am of the other faction, however, there is a Mod out there that allows you to inspect players from the other faction.<br />
<br />
I apologize, I did not mean to offend anyone.</div></div><hr />

Those sound like reasonable signs to me. I read an article about them once. They work in sweat shops practically, hundreds maybe more cramped close together, working for very little money.

<br />
Hide of the Wild pattern, eh?? Wow, it would require some serious farming to get the materials to make one of those.<br />
<br />
Tygre,<br />
Sounds like you are saying rage builds on the hits we take. That makes better sense to me, but I thought it built on the hits I delivered, because It doesn't seem to build any faster whether I have one or 3 mobs beating on me.<br />
I've been taking care of the 3 mobs one at a time. I've never really bothered with Swipe because it seems to deliver very little damage to the mobs. Too bad it is not like the hunters multi shot that will combine for a single hit on one mob.<br />
I will try your method though. Anything to make it go faster. And I will try the Swipe on the apparition mob too. <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
And got people to farm the stuff for me and buys it all for 200g and then sell a complete cloak for around 300-400g...<br />
Also got a buiness partner who farms em, i take care of Hide and leather and he essences and somtimes we buy the larval and then split the gold. <br />
<br />
Its easy when you first get such a pattern. The options are many.</div></div><hr />

For less rage you can just use Demoralizing Roar and they will die.<br />
<br />
All of our bear abilities are not really meant to do alot of damage.  For the amount of rage used swipe is not very efficient at doing damage.  What swipe does do, better than maul or demoralizing roar, is generate aggro.  Since you're solo and therfore not competing for aggro it's just not the right tool.<br />
<br />
Also, allowing three mobs to beat on you when you could have killed one is not the best idea.  You end up taking alot more damage that way and it'll just slow you down.  Yes, more incoming damage means more rage.  More rage leads to more damage also.  The amount of damage you take is much more than the amount of damage you'll be able to put out because of a few rage points.<br />
<br />
If you've got 10 levels on the mobs the above strategy makes sense.  The amount of incoming damage is minimal as you have more HP and higher AC.  If you've got that much on the mobs you should probably be in cat form though.</div></div><hr />

Woah!!  Never knew that one because I typically only demo'd at the beginning.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Swipe on the 3-spawns...I dunno.  I have had mixed results killing one at a time in bear and also hitting them all using swipe.  Thorns on and regrowth at the begining of the pull for each scenario.  Both methods left me around half health at the end.  I guess I just felt like I whittled them down more if I used swipe as opposed to mauling each one at a time.  *shrug<br />
<br />
But that is what is so great about this forum.  Learn new tips and techniques (heh, I just did as evident above) and apply them to your own playstyle to find what works best for you.</div></div><hr />

The 2nd and 3rd are usually down to 50% health from the moonfire and thorns by the time I start on them. <br />

The mob that seems to triplicate itself is just a Phantom that creates illusions of itself. These illusions are one-hit-kills so no need to worry, just hit it once with moonfire and continue on with your mob.  :)</div></div><hr />
