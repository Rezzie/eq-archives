In Naxx this weekend though i'm 90% sure it wasn't showing up on bosses :(. Anyone verify this? Is this a glitch or intended?</div></div><hr />

Some are immune (mechanicals seem to be) but it also seems that some bosses cleanse themselves as FF seems to fall off sometimes also.  I just reapply and carry on.</div></div><hr />

Maybe 2-4 bosses in Naxx are affected by it????<br />
<br />
I think most, if not all, of the 5-man bosses are affected by it.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully the debuff limit change will show things better.  I'll keep better track of IW when I am back in Naxx tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">12-08-2008, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it is...  Thunderclap was available pre-LK, and I think some bosses were not affected by it.  The bosses are not affected one or both (movement speed debuff, attack speed debuff) of the effects.  Though the loss of a movement speed debuff is minor against boss mobs as that is primarily a PvP debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">12-09-2008, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i'm only really curious about raid bosses. This is disappointing if it only works on 5 bosses in Naxx. Would it possibly be better then to invest in improved demo roar(aka feral aggression)? current build: http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Akama&amp;n=Heartcrusher</div></div><hr />

I know I had an issue with IW not showing up on bosses on my screen but others in the group could see it on theres.  I run CTBar addon that manages debuffs etc.  I think its just an addon glitch.  <br />
<br />
Some bosses do cleanse themselves though, but that in no way makes it a useless ability.  You should be reapplying it every 6 secs or so.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
XPERL has an option to show the debuffs you put up larger than the others and always move them to the front of the debuff slots.  Very useful when playing my warlock to make sure that DoTs weren't falling off, I can assume also very useful to make sure bleeds / IW / etc are still up.<br />
 <br />
And IIRC, attack speed slowing effects work on (most) all bosses, but movement slowing don't.  Which is why it was always so important to have Thunderclap up as much as possible on bosses.</div></div><hr />
