You'll probably be lvl 58 before you finish WPL.<br />

Focus on questing and not grinding.  The changes made last Nov make it such that rapid questing is far faster than grinding (if grinding ever was faster).  If you run into a hard quest, skip it.  There are plenty more.  Don't forget about rest XP, make sure you log off in an inn or major city.  I know I never left rest XP from lvl 35(?)-70.  It makes it go so much faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">09-23-2008, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one thing I should point out (and what I really hate about the old world) is that often a zone has a first round of quests you can do in the zone at lvl X, but the remaining quests require you to be X+2 (or 3), which means you often have to do the first third of a zone, leave it for another zone and come back later.  Ex.  When you reach Azshara you might be able to do the first batch of quests, but then you'll want to leave for Hinterlands, only to return.<br />
<br />
In the Outlands, that never happens.  The zones are all linear, which is so much nicer.<br />
<br />
While solo leveling, the mobs you are attacking should be high greens or low yellows.  Basically 2-3 levels lower than your level.  Sure you can kill a +1-2 lvl mob, but they sap so many resources that your XP/hour (or just kills/hour) rate drops because you have to stop to eat/drink, etc.  So, if the mobs are all 4+ below you it is time to leave.  If they are all -1 to +1 you might have arrived too soon.  Though, if you are just about to level you can probably stay.</div></div><hr />

Getting the 41 point talent Mangle is worth its weight in gold.  For me, the end of the 40s is an interesting push.  I highly recommend finishing up as much of Hinterlands as you can... do the rest of Feralas and then do the rest of Tanaris.  That should comfortably put you up to 50 or 51.<br />
<br />
Azshara is nice for late 40s as well, but the zone is a bit barren and doing some of the quests is a PITA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once I hit 50 I pranced over to Un'Goro then Winterspring.<br />
<br />
The rep quest in order to walk through the Timbermaw Hold cave gave me about a level worth of kill XP, but it was worth it for me.</div></div><hr />

Am I in the wrong area or what am I doing wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-30-2008, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By 49 you should be able to finish up the rest of Tanaris or look at lower Felwood or maybe Azshara.  Hinterlands is probably a bit too low.  Another option you might be on the verge of is there is a sequence of gathering quests (horrid ones no less) in the Blasted Lands where you have to kill about a million things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-01-2008, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could always do the Rep quest for the Timbermaw Hold in Northern Felwood.  It's definitely a mundane sort of grind, but from Kill XP alone I gained an entire level because the drop rates on some of the rep quest items is sort of low.  <br />
<br />
You'll need rep with them to wander through the cave without getting attacked to head to Winterspring.  (Prowl didn't work for me...thank goodness for dash!)<br />
<br />
Felwood in general was a lot of fun for me.<br />
<br />
And congratulations on lvl 49!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tankwhomee</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just keep questing, quests will level you faster than grinding, and head to ungoro crater to start on some of the quests there, as 49 is a good starting level there. <br />
<br />
Make sure you start the linkens memory quest early, as it will take you to winterspring, felwood, feralis and tanaris, and is probaly close to a level by itself when followed through from start to finish.  there is no really great quest reward, but it will give you some purpose while you level and travel from one area to another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait wait wait... I completely forgot 49 is the PERFECT level for Searing Gorge... very tight quest locations... lots of quests can be worked on all at once and it takes about 2 minutes tops to get to the farthest place you'd need to quest at from the flight path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;html&gt;Oh yes!  I loved the Un'Goro quests!  <br />
<br />
Just watch out for those blasted Devilsaurs!  They sneak right up on you and next thing you know...splat!<br />
<br />
There's also a Druid Quest there...just make sure you talk to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=9619#starts&quot;&gt;Towra Pathfinder&lt;/a&gt;.  The quest will ultimately take you into Sunken Temple.  <br />
<br />
A lot of the instance quests give you some pretty decent experience in the end, and I believe everyone has a quest in the Sunken Temple.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wowhead.com/?quests=2.1417&quot;&gt;Here's a list of the quests available for Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt;.  I loved that instance!</div></div><hr />
