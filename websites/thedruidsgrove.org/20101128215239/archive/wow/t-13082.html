I'm in a small non-raiding guild.  I'm a dedicated dps and this is my current spec.  Is Master Shapeshifter really worth it, and should I take IMotW? Any other help would be appreciated.<br />

MS is really only worth it for PvP, and Berserk is crazy fun burst dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for pure group DPS, furor has almost no use (gives you a bit of energy after you shift out to brez, I guess), so why not give your group a bigger boost from 2/2 iMotW?  Though if you have a Resto Druid in your group, you don't need it as they will already have it.<br />
<br />
1/1 OoC, 2/2 SA, 3/3 PI, 3/3 iMangle, 5/5 RnT, 3/3 KotJ and 1/1 Berserk are a must for a pure DPS'r.<br />
<br />
If I wanted a pure DPS build, I'd start with 0/53/16 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZEMMcfrb0eo0huAobAczb) build.  But would strongly consider giving up 5/3 MS for more stuff out of the Feral tree.</div></div><hr />

i agree with Oiy and tlb.</div></div><hr />

And it's one of the few talents left that increases your damage.  <br />
<br />
As for improved mangle for raid DPS it's not worth filling it out.  2/3 is sufficient.  You should not be in any way mangle spamming on raids except maybe for trash mobs.  <br />
<br />
Also 5/5 Furor is still good because energy regenerates in caster with this too so if you switch from cat -&gt; caster to heal/brez and then go back you'll have a full 100 energy bar.  If you're raiding, hopefully you'll have another druid with IMotW.  <br />
<br />
I agree with all the other comments though about beserk/PI/etc.  <br />

Personally I'd reccomend this build.  You can take those two points in infected wounds and play around with them.  (I didn't think brutal impact really effected your DPS at all).</div></div><hr />
