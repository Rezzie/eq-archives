<br />
I have been back for about a month now, and in that time have gotten about 50 AAs, sitting at a little over 250 total.  With double EXP weekend upon us, I want to really try and catch up on some vital AAs.  I put most of that 50 AA into Maxing out my healing AAs, with only the last level of Healing Gift Mastery left to go.<br />
<br />
My question is, since I will probably be applying to a Raiding Guild of at least Qvic level, hopefully Anguish, What AAs should I focus on for raiding?  What do high end guilds expect druids to have?<br />
<br />
When not raiding, I'm trying to group mostly.  Only really like soloing while LFG.  I'd be putting some AA into the DOT or DD line for that, but mostly want to focus on raiding.<br />
<br />
Here's my recent Magelo... http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=149890<br />

Thanks for your Wisdom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that get Spirit of the Grove max, quickened curing, chaotic potential, mental clarity, expansive mind, spell casting reinforcement, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery (good for longer buffs) in that order - or at least in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Then get whatver I guess...</div></div><hr />

Just 2 more AA to finish up Gift and Adept Healing lines, will get that within the next hour.  I'll work on SotG next, SotW has always been one of my favorite AAs.</div></div><hr />

Good order imo.  After those defensive aas are nice.  If your looking into raiding, they'll help ya a bit on mobs that spawn quite a few adds.  Healing is nice agro np.  Spell casting subtley 3 (didnt see if u had it) is kinda nice too.</div></div><hr />

That aa is the bomb, I would get it before sotw and maxxing healing adepts all day long, and I am a HUGE fan of the healing aas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">03-22-2006, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would wait till after the healing AAs for GoM for the reasoning that healing more will save you mana as well, and it will also help you be a better healer in the process.  GoM will only save you mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhosyn</div><div class="date">03-22-2006, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't really be an expert on that call, since I did get all my healing aas first, i just remember my mind being blown by how terrific gom is.   I had no idea it went off so frequently.   I think you're right though, healing aas first on principle.  But GoM is only one bank of AAs which drastically affect your healing (major mana save) and nuking (gives me more opportunities to nuke cause woohoo, gom fired and noone needs a heal).  Also gom works on blessing of steeloak, including mgbing it.  That is a -nice- 1 mana cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a question, is the 1 mana accounted before or after casting.  For example, specialization affects happen after casting.  If a spell cost 500 to cast, but only actually cost 400 due to specialization, you still need 500 to begin the casting.  <br />
<br />
Is it the same for GoM or will it let you cast a 500mana spell with only 1 mana on your bar?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">03-23-2006, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, GoM is like a huge preservation, so it fires off after the cast is complete. You have to have all the mana available to you already, which I learned the hard way with Dread Pyre =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tryon</div><div class="date">03-24-2006, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finshed off my healing AAs, GoM, SotG all the way to Conv of Spirits 1, and am now working on Chaotic Potential (only 1/5, these are expensive, heh) and Lightning Reflexes (currently 3/5)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice everyone.<br />
<br />
At 324 AAs now thanks to the weekend.<br />
