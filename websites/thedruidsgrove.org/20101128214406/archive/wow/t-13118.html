However, now that i'm finally building my gear my rotation is gonna have to change.<br />
<br />
Change? yes because my crit is getting high enough where my rip and SR are still ticking when i need to blow combo points. I'm thinking once my crit is a little higher, i'm gonna start the finishing move rotation, SR, RIP, FB (hopefuly TF is on CD) here, repeat. <br />
<br />
I just don't like FB because its a energy regen destroyer. While great at pvp, FB seems to mean that i'm not going to get to use a move for 4-5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Thoughts on this change in rotation, and its necessiity?</div></div><hr />

That means working a FB in between rips on bosses.  You'll have to see where it lands you, but I'd say even 3 points is a reasonable FB for mid-combat, but let your energy be your guide.  If you're going to be blowing 10+ energy by FBing, just toss another mangle/shred and wait for it to pop up on the next one.</div></div><hr />

I generally FB right at 35 energy.  I don't see a difference between doing this and hitting mangle because it's the same dead space.<br />
<br />
My rotation as it stands actually just involves keeping savage roar, rake and rip on the target and hitting mangles and shreds in between with FBs if rip is still running.  <br />
<br />
While I'm DPsing though, my energy is never ever going to be over 42 though so I don't find FB to be a huge energy waste.  I don't ever recomend dumping a full 100 energy on a FB but tossing them inbetween rips is can get you some nice 8000-10,000 crits even with 35 energy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm did some more experimenting, there seems to be some lag between when the 35 energy is used, and when the &quot;added&quot; energy is used, and during this lag period more energy regenerates... so its never just 35 energy, id' say i'm using over 50% nergy which makes this really ****ty. The RnT crit guarentee is nice, but without KoJ off cooldown, FB seems for situational only. I'd rather just spam shreds over the 5 point cap and loose the combo points sadly. For PVP its too bad FB uses 100% energy, i really wish it was more like eviserate. But i understand its value is too important pvp.</div></div><hr />

So then past 40% crit, i'm curious useless crit is.</div></div><hr />
