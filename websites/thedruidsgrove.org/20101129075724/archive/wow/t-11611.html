<br />
On a side note, it was a fun run cause I was dps'ing (another feral druid was MT), but on the multi pulls I'd OT, then switch back to dps, and I'd occasionally heal or innervate the priest.  Truly felt like a Druid.<br />
<br />
But the stupid rogues suck.  Out of nowhere our priest was dead. Nerf instance rogues.  <br />
<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a brighter note, I've heard that they're decreasing the amount of rogues that pop out in SL when the  patch hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rogues there can be painfully annoying, but probably wouldn't be so bad were they not popping out just as you have some of the hardest pulls in the instance ( if not the hardest ).<br />
<br />
Shattered Halls has a few rogues in it, but don't seem to be anywhere near as annoying, perhaps due to their placement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhroam</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you start pulling, I suggest having a hunter flare or human with perception walk around the room with the 1st boss.  This should help.<br />
<br />
Another help is Elixir of the Searching Eye.  They give you extra stealth detection for 10m.  The recipe is a BoE drop... and will give you something useful to do with Ragvail =]<br />
<br />
I believe the shattered halls rogues are confined.  Since you're walking down a hallway, you can have a hunter flare every 10 yards as you walk down between the 1st and 2nd boss and most definitely between the 2nd and last boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had a hunter with us, and he was flaring as often as he could, and we waited for a while before a pull, to see if any rogues would pat into us, but none did.  We assumed we killed them all (already killed 4, with 3 wipes), and out of the clear blue on that 6 person pull a rogue kills the healer in like 4 hits.  Wipe # 4.  Oh well, at least I don't have to go back there again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The number of rogues varies wildly, we had runs with none and runs with 7.<br />
<br />
To prevent a wipe: If you are in the group as DD, wait stealthed in cat-form near the healer and pounce the moment the rogue pops out. Have patience that could take 10-20 secs of waiting and letting the other DPS. If you are the tank, stay close to your healer and bash the moment the rogue pops out. Use feral charge if you don't want to stay that close.<br />
<br />
With that tactic you should no longer wipe because of rogues.<br />
<br />
If the rogue still kills your healer: Shift out -&gt; barkskin -&gt; tranquility -&gt; b-rezz -&gt; innervate the healer -&gt; throw some heals and hots around -&gt; bear -&gt; get aggro and keep the mobs of your healer. <br />
The standard move in &quot;oh crap&quot;-situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although our damage in cat form warrants the comparison ^^</div></div><hr />

Everyone always call them DPS so I wanted to be sure.</div></div><hr />

She was a dwarf priest with huge juggs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">04-04-2007, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the deffently nurfed the number of rogues spawned during clearing of that room.  The deal with those rogues is you can wait all day long for them to spawn and sweep the whole room with anti-stealth detection and not find them.  Then on the pull they pop out and gank someone.  Its random chance after or when each group is pulled.  Not sure which one it is to be honest they also seem to have a spawn point both inside the room and in the other room behind that was cleared prior to that room.  The primary thing to do is make sure your healer does not get killed by supprise when they do deside to come.  To do this you need to make sure the healer is never the person in the FAR BACK or all the way forward.  He needs to maintain a spot between everyone as they rogue will then jump someone else.  This lets someone else take the stealth hit.  I hate that room more then any other place in that whole place.  I ussually die there at least once due to those darn rogues.  Though not near as much now days.</div></div><hr />
