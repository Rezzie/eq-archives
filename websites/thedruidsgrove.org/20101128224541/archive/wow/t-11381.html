I've decided i'm going to stay balance and the GM has given me permission to roll on cloth damage gear. <br />
<br />
What I really want to know is, is it worth me spending all my DKP on cloth damage gear or is the stuff I have ok?<br />
<br />
I have 6/8 Stormrage which has serverd me well for crit but has only 170 damage, i've also tried my feralheart set which  has a lot more damage but hardly any crit. This isnt completely updated but gives an idea of what i have  http://wow.allakhazam.com/profile.html?1602627<br />
<br />
I've got Leggings of immersion and am going to go for gloves of ebru when they drop.<br />
<br />
What would you say is the best kind of gear to go for? I'll mostly be using moonkin in PVE but am doing some pvp aswell.<br />
<br />
Would really apreciate some help as i'm kinda confused and a little bit overwhelmed trying to search trhough all this stuff and not really knowing what i'm looking for :p<br />

<br />
for leather waist and wrists, there aren't any spelldmg bracers/belts better than cenarion. i would go cloth for those two pieces, until some better leather spelldmg pieces come out in bc.<br />
<br />
weapon, off-hand, rings, trinkets, neck, back items are up for u to decide... :)</div></div><hr />
