<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trevize</div><div class="date">10-03-2004, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My great misconception of epic 1.5/2.0.   When I heard the 1.5 epic was largely 1 group doable for most and a medium raid at the end, I was very happy.   I thought to myself; this will be great,  get a group of friends we'll work on each epic in turn as a group.  After a few weekends we'll be very far along in progression or even done with 1.5.   The druid epic however, involves solo activities.   Foraging,  this epic to anybody?  Foraging, in Rathe Mtns,  North Ro,  EJ, etc.   Is making a golblin disguis epic?   Is chasing a goblin hider under the world epic?   Is prentending to be a singing skeleton epic?   Is this in your minds epic?   Well, in my mind it is de-grading and insulting.   <br />
<br />
I find it insulting that at almost every turn of this quest I'm met with bottle necks, bugged events and a &quot;take a number druid_9999999&quot; for camping rare named spawns that rarely drop what is needed.  (eastern waste for example).  <br />
<br />
So while my guild largely has their epic 1.5 done and the guild focus is on everybody finishing their anguish key.  Then their focus will be on epic 2.0.  Where will I be?   Ya you guess it,  foraging in North Ro.<br />
<br />
This isn't epic.   This isn't epic at all.  It's sad.<br />
<br />
So I'm sorry SOE that I misunderstood this epic quest.   Perhaps better luck next time?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
and if you cant get you guild to help you with you epic. then maybe you should find a new guild.<br />

This quote, in relation to Trevize, made me chuckle.  I don't see him doing that Haillon  :dance:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, the best &quot;epic&quot; quest I went on had a great story and background to go with it.  It involved investigating missing persons, creating items, doing tasks for various related NPCS that were connected via the story and, in each portion involved a raid (or mini raid as it would be in the EQ world).  This quest wasn't in EQ, however.<br />
<br />
The EQ epic never made any sense to me as to why I should do it or even how.  It was mostly guesswork and tedium.  I think that is the way of Sony games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always like the DAoC epic armor concept.  You started the quest at I think level 6 with mini quests every 2-4 levels each mini quest being soloable or small groupable.  And each mini quest giving an item appropriate to your level.  At level 50 (top level) you got the final quest which was a small raid event and were rewarded with a full set of level appropriate armor.  <br />
<br />
I know that once a few expansions came out the Epic Armor was no longer the best you could get but there were still pieces of the set that were pretty dang good.  Not having played DAoC for quite awhile they may have changed the rewards since I played.</div></div><hr />

1 stats (but if I can get something else with roughly the same stats - then I will go for that. Although lower stats, I still want to get a shot at http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24576 :D)<br />
2 it looks pretty (which is subjective, and not important)</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't if at all possible just like in the old world there was no druid quest armor.    I don't know who Soe put in charge of druids but obviously they never played one and probably still hate them from being either KS'd or trained by one when lv 10..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have been a druid since release date.  I meant prior to and including South Ro..  <br />
<br />
The only questable items we got were the tarnished scimitar (yippie), the halfling ring, Paw of Opalla, the tome, 2hb hammer and the 1hb with yaulp. About the time of S. Ro we got the Raiders Cap, shovel and belt for halflings.   <br />
<br />
It wasn't till PoF opened that we got class armor and then Vermiculated was heavy as heck with no wisdom on it.  Took me close to two years to get my Verm BP. <br />
<br />
SoE has a track record of not putting DRU on either leather or priest items and not having a lot of DRU class items.   We are lucky they even included us in the Epics or that it has stats we can use.   I was half expecting it to have have something like another 3 min dot or maybe a Root with a DD.   Or maybe a focus of Reanimation Haste V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fulgrun</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">trevize well yea that kinda is epic or at least it is now =) soe has made epics alot more harder! and alot more challenging! and its going to take alot more time! they've added extra things also in there =) like baking and what not. get used to it. its not as easy as the old epic, OF COURSE ITS NOT! why would it be the same difficulty. they made it for the players who alrdy have the awesome gear and what not as a challenge and no i dont believe that anyone has solved the druid epic yet so if its to different for you, dont do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">10-06-2004, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont mean to come off as rude, but honestly...  that just really doesnt apply to Trevize.  He's been around since day one, just like Kulothar, myself, and many others here.  These are people who did the original epic when it was hard and not the duo adventure it's become.  We're talking about leaving a toon out in TD because stupid Faydedar spawned once a week and lasted about 20 minutes before being killed by the Iksar Master or depopping, and needing 30-ish people to kill him.  (To this day I remember when my friends fayd-bot died, and my guild at the time stopped the raid in progress - killing WW dragons woot! - to boogie out there and kill the little sucker.)<br />
<br />
So before telling some of these old vets who are still playing to &quot;suck it up&quot;, take a second to do a little research, and realize that they already have - about a billion times in this game, and if they are complaining about something, it's with very good reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">10-08-2004, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes the Fay spawn was what stopped me.  When they put in the mini-Fay my life changed and after getting 3 guilds together we were able to take her down and finally get our druids epics.   The VS raid was always a nightmare also on par with the Ragefire part of the Clerics.  You had to be quick to get the spawn and hope he dropped our item... Think I got lucky and got mine on my 4th raid. <br />
<br />
Now it takes a person that 4 boxes a couple of weeks and they are Epic.   It only takes that long because of the foraging. <br />
<br />
I do appreciate SoE correcting what made getting our Epic almost impossible but then they are the ones that made the problems to begin with.   I used to help friends get Bard and Rogue epics and there was nothing nearly as hard about them as ours.   I don't mind ours requiring Uber incounters but then RvR states it should have Uber stats and abilities.</div></div><hr />

I keep seeing people state that Trevize's guild won't help him get his epic?  I read his post to say that the &quot;epic&quot; quest was fraught with bugs and the steps to gather a lot of the parts were not what one would expect from any quest labeled &quot;epic&quot;. I never saw him say his guild refused to help him.  :/  <br />

I think its more a statement of the difference gear makes then how hard this is to do.  Things I did duo I have seen others have to use 1 or 2 groups to do.  Not sure about your server but here we only have 5 Time+ guilds(had 6 but FoH left for WoW beta).  I just figured this would be the same for most of the other servers so if your in the top 5ish guilds that clear Time in one raid, Raiding GoD content(KT, Ikk, Uqua, Qvic, ect.), and Doing RS Raids, MPG Trials then you are right our epic is not very epic.  But like I said it's more a statement of the difference Highend gear makes then anything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">10-28-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd think +5% nuke damage from a raid would be worth it.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have 20 - odd nukers, who do on average 500 DPS.<br />
<br />
A +5% nuke mod (if it is straight 5%, and not 0% to 5%, or whatever it ends up being) is 500 more DPS over 1 minute.  If it is 0%-5%, that's 15000 more damage over the minute.<br />
<br />
Not bad.  But only 1 druid can use it per minute per mob.  Diminishing returns starts early.<br />
<br />
In a group with 3 nukers doing 500 DPS -- well, the creature will die before the minute is up (that's 90 k damage).  So, lets say a creature with 40 k hps, and 2/3 the damage is done by nuking.  Then the clicky does 1300 or 650 damage, or 11 to 22 DPS while active, and 1 to 2 DPS sustained.<br />
<br />
The clicky scales overly well.  Outside of raids it is junk.  On raids, the one or two druids with it are benefiting the raid alot, while any extra are ignoreable.</div></div><hr />

Joy!&quot;. Druids are a priest class, I wished we've gotten some kind of healing focus or something else that's actually useful. Other epics tend to suck as well and hah, to no surprise: The cleric epic rocks. You think cleric owners have to cough up more monthly fee for their enjoyment? I think not :p It's not fair I tell you :(</div></div><hr />

But seriously,  the first 15 -30 seconds is melee setting the agro usually...  It is rare that casters start throwing nukes as soon as the mob is pulled.  If the Epic also lowered agro on those nukes that it boosted then THAT would be more useful.</div></div><hr />

I know it's not right to compare, particuarly when my comparison is to something considered outrageously good by so many non-priest classes, but in contrast to the cleric epic 2.0 clicky (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6265),  the druid one (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6269) is just rediculous.<br />
