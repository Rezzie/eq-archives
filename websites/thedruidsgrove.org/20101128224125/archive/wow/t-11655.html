<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So something that has been buggin at me in the back of my mind is why strength is roughly equal to agility for cat forms.  The sad part is that we need our talents to make it that way.  That has never really added up for me.  It seems to me that the devs would designate strength as the attribute buffed in cat form by HotW because it was actually far better for us than agi.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I did find something that leads me to believe that strength is, in fact, largely better, but every other post on the net seems to discredit it.  If you look at our damage range when equipping strength at level 70, we gain +1 to our range for every 4-5 strength.  Since the cat attack speed is 1.0, this is effectively a 1 dps gain.  In terms of attack power, 1 dps = 14 ap.  Every other calculation out there rates strength as only slightly better after talents to agility, but none of them take this into account.  After this damage range bonus, our gain from strength is almost double.  <br />
<br />
I feel like I must be missing something to have been the only one to notice this.  I thought at first I may be seeing the after-effects of ap being factor into the damage range equation, but that didn't make sense either as 4-5 str x 1.2 = 10-12ap, not 14 (which is the 1 dps gap).  Lookin for some more theorycrafters to research this stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was a strength-addict for very long. But now I am around 2,4k AP unbuffed and start caring more and more about agility. <br />
<br />
Why? Because the more AP you have the more 1% crit gives you in terms of damage done. Especially taking Predatory Instincts into account.<br />
The relative gain form additional 100 AP gets less and less the better my equip gets, but the gain from one more percent crit chance gets higher and higher. So after a certain point agi just gives me more than a comparable amount of str.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that agi also increases dodge, which I like very much. Because dead kitty does no damage :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I'm thinking that we should get b/w 30-33% crit, then throw the rest into strength.  Tbh, those are just numbers I pulled out of air, but once I got to that threshold of crit, I felt like I had enough to abuse the 2x combo points.  <br />
<br />
I'm hoping to see a significant dps boost when I finish my tier 4.  I'm up for the pants so hopefully they will drop tonight, then I can just equip the gloves and be gtg.  Between the two of those and the 4-pc bonus, I should see a 200ap upgrade.  I'm about to finish a transaction (still haggling lol) for the Staff of Natural Fury which I'm pretty excited about too.  Outside of the 30str/30sta upgrades, I've become very confident with power-shifting to abuse Furor, and with 500 mana shifts, I really do think it will make a nice sustained dps difference.  If anything it will allow me to actually take advantage of the mana pool/regen buffs on raid and convert them to physical dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobull</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't paid too much attention to AP tbh, but at 43 the most available armor is +agi +sta, so I've been noticing my crit% to be very nice.  Not to mention the dodge/armor bonus from +agi and with Imp.LotP getting that little bit of health with every crit is nice while grinding (the longer I can stay in cat the better).<br />
<br />
But from the higher level persepective, should it even matter to me what stats I focus on or should I just keep grinding to 60-70 when stats/equip start to really matter?  In other words, save my money for other things rather than equip swap every friggin level and wait until then to worry about euip stats.  Because right now I feel like a +agi +sta whore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't waste any money till you get 70; quest rewards and instance drops are more than sufficient.  At 70, your gear options will diverge to a point that you need completely seperate gear for feral pvp, pve tanking, and pve dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobull</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for that input.  Im already feeling the effects of always spending money on new equip to maximize stats because Im at 43 and still can't afford a mount!  And I also keep having to sell off equip I get in drops because I spent good gold to get equivalent euip in AH... /sigh<br />
<br />
Sorry for the tangent, continue on with main discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get to the Outlands at lv 58, you will get some excelent stuff from the first few quests / instances there.  You get a blue chest piece that'll take you to 70 and a feral staff that'll last until you get into the Blood Furnace (second instance you'll enter).<br />
<br />
In the first two instances, you can get a nice pair of shoulders, some nice rings, and all the green drops are high quality.  LOTS of stuff with +str +agi and +sta on them.<br />
<br />
Pre 60 gear doesn't really matter, unless you wanna dominate a bg bracket at say 39 or 49.  You will still want to have 2 sets though:  feral and healing.  Eventually, you'll end up with 3 completley separate sets as Chloee said (maybe 4 if you collect balance gear too)  It certainly helps to have a set with int / spi for healing, as you won't go far healing in your feral +agi +sta gear.  If you have the time, you can keep up to date on gear by running instances over and over and over while leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Str doesn't offer us any crit/dodge, so a nice mix of str/agi is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If something has a large amount of str, it's probably safe to assume it's good for us.  :)<br />
<br />
My DPS set has around 32% crit and 2100 AP self-buffed, and I'm pretty happy with it... I like critting admittedly (although I do have to watch my aggro, not really used to that xD), could have more AP but I like the crit. &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;  I'll probably start going for more AP stuff now though, since I'm pretty happy with my crit rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i still tend to try to mix str and agi as bhroam said.<br />
<br />
currently am only on around 26% crit and 1850ap so looking to boost both over time.<br />
<br />
but i do like STR for its 1str=2.4ap=more damage=quicker dead mobs.<br />
<br />
i really enjoy cat now with BC for levelling / questing whereas preBC i always used bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I know that str gives ap.  I'm just adding that I think it increases our damage range separately and is therefore far better than agility.  If someone actually knows this to be true, it would be totally against the way most people gear themselves.  <br />
<br />
Proof or no proof, I've been sold on the evidence I've found and I'm starting to rework my set to strength.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our damage output (based on atkpwr) increases noticeably when we get Battleshout and Blessing of Might, however, critical chance is still important for Druids. Actually, I would say critical chance is a lil more important to us than other classes for sustained dps. We have the talent that gives us a 10% dmg bonus to our critical strikes. That extra damage from crits off-sets the need for atkpwr substantially.<br />
<br />
Just in case it was overlooked, we get 1ap per point of Agility when we switch to Catform. We used to get 1ap per point of Strength, but they changed that a while back. This is separate from the bonus we gain from HoTW.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">03-26-2007, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I focused on str and then gave some regard to Agi once I hit 2000AP. I am now at 2300AP and 30% crit and 31% dodge which I find out of this world. I cannot all out dps now no matter which warrior in my guild I run with...I just suck in the aggro (cower button is loose and wobbly now). But if you get to a point on the Ap you are comfortable with I would suggest then switching out to Agi for the increase in dodge and crit. If you control your aggro right you will be at the top of the damage meter with more emphasis being on str and aggro control than agi for crit and dodge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's not just you but in Outlands the quest rewards are much more minding of feral druids so don't worry. Gear for just leveling shouldn't be worried about...I was still using Silvermanes Family Seal (sp?) @ 60 =o</div></div><hr />

Now I all I have to worry about until I do get into Outlands is the color of my armor, gotta look good while grinding you know. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">03-27-2007, 07:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya its probably to much to ask, (although easy for them to do), to atleast have them give Dire bear an armored look that would change depending on your gear and whether you were Horde or Alliance. Also would be nice if we were to get a Dire Cat form with the same effects.<br />
<br />
 Like Trix said though, unless your wanting to twink for low lvl BG's dont even worry about gear to much. The only thing I will spend gold on for an alt is weapon upgrades just for grinding, although for a druid that dosent mean quite as much i guess. Just get to 58 and you will start to get quite a selection of gear choices.</div></div><hr />
