I followed this awesome guide:  Kitties For Dummies: The Common Mistakes (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=18031239854&amp;sid=1). Just some tweeks on how, when and what I use increased DPS. I don't mind taking a beating for not knowing an instance, but damn, I at least need to know about my own friggin' toon.</div></div><hr />

I'm bear/resto, so I wouldn't have the foggiest idea how to improve the dps on kitty- the guide looks great though.<br />

I think our resident kitten is still on vacation or he would have been all over this =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
First please remove claw from your bar once you get mangle.  I'm glad you read up and hopefully that'll help a bit but make sure you only mangle enough to keep the mangle debuff on the target.  <br />
<br />
It's all about your bleed timers and debuffs.  Get some combo points and pop Savage Roar.  <br />
<br />
I'm at work so I can't really take a huge look at your talents and gear but the basic concept is stack agi until you can get a decent ArP rating, something like 500 without gems then start stacking ArP gems if you can also get some sort of ArP trinket.  <br />
<br />
You want to aim for at least over 50% crit unbuffed to smooth out your rotation.  <br />
<br />
Priority is:<br />
<br />
SR<br />
Mangle Debuff on Target (or an Arms Warrior)<br />
Rake<br />
Rip<br />
<br />
Ferocious Bite can be used if you don't think the boss is going to live beyond 12 seconds or your Rip has 50% duration and your SR is up.<br />
<br />
Glyphs: Savage Roar (a must), Rip, Shred<br />
<br />
You could alternatively use beserk glyph but I prefer the other two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i checked out the thread that you linked, and there was a lot of useful information there... <br />
<br />
The way i've conveyed the &quot;rotation&quot; before is that it's a lot like spinning plates...<br />
<br />
Keep Mangle up<br />
Keep Rake up<br />
Keep Rip up<br />
Keep SR up<br />
<br />
99.99999% of the time i open with Mangle because i have the Idol of Mutilation. So i go mangle rake shred to 5 cp's then SR, Tiger's Fury, and my Vengeance of the Forsaken trinket (i could probably eek out a little more dps by popping SR earlier, but i like to use my TF timer as a reference for refreshing SR... GET OMNI CC to show your cooldowns in big numbers) refresh Mangle, rake, shred to 5 CP's and Rip. THEN i pop berzerk and go nuts, spamming Shred to 5 CP's and then FB. With Berzerk active, i can usually pull that cycle off twice before everything drops off and i start over again.<br />
<br />
I'm currently running about 63-64% chance to crit raid buffed, and when my Idol of Mutilation procs, AND my Death's Choice procs, that goes up pretty substantially, and allows a LOT more time to pull off a FB without any other buffs/debuffs to drop off. I like stacking agility (and crit when agility isn't available for my gem choice... i'll admit im a little neurotic about getting my gem slot bonuses) because rip tick crits are om nom nommy and it makes its easier to generate CP's.<br />
<br />
hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />
