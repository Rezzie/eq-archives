If you are tanking, Wildfury Greatstaff from SSC is better. If you are DPSing, Terestian's Stranglestaff from kara or Merciless Gladiator's Maul from arena is better. And since we can swap weapons in and out during combat, why would you use Pillar of Ferocity? There's probably a couple occasions where it's better, maybe tanking hydross adds where you are taking magical damage so the extra stamina helps. But for being our tier 6 instance weapon, it sucks ass.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the only thing it's good for is taking more damage and building a tad more threat. -That- makes a lot of sense. [/sarcasm]<br />

I wish we had a DPS staff upgrade (other than arena weapons).<br />
I wish we had a tanking staff upgrade.<br />
<br />
This is both, but also fails in both departments. Hybrid weapons do NOT work due to not only lacking in some areas (dodge for tanking, and +hit and crit (agility) for DPS), but there's also the factor that you can swap weapons in combat.<br />
