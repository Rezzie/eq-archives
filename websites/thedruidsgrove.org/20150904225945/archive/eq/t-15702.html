<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palladballad</div><div class="date">03-26-2007, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After several petitions to SOE and being reassured the issue is being looked at, yet nothing's been done, I'm wondering if any fellow EQers are having the same problem. Brother Hayle, the SoulFire hand-in NPC that usually spawns NW of Splitpaw in South Karana, has been missing for several weeks now on the Combine server. Has anyone else had this problem recently? I've met two players in-game who told me that they did find him recently and were able to complete the quest, so I'm wondering if he might be a spawned NPC, a roamer, or anything similar. I want to move on with my Pally Epic, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />
