My account expires on Monday and I'm going to be out of town for the weekend, so today was my last day on WoW. :cry:  As I am broke, that leaves me with old faithful. . .Halo 2.  Most of the people I have met on here seem like good peoples, so I was wondering if anyone wanted to hook up some time to play some H2?  XBox Live gamertag is Mysikal Jester (yes, there is a space, and it is needed).  Anywho, look me up on Halo or chat me up in here.</div></div><hr />

Too bad dude.  I would have shared my money making schemes with you. Hahaha.  Come and visit TDG sometimes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, your account won't be deleted for a while, so once you get money again you can start right where you left off.</div></div><hr />

I intend to keep coming here as this is what I do to keep from being entirely bored at work.  It's nice to know someone at least responded.  I had a few RL buds who have offered to all chip in to pay for me to continue to play, but I feel somehow wrong taking their money. . .go figure.</div></div><hr />

Then again, it might be a blessing in disguise, if ur anything like me the other aspects of your life kinda become background noise when ur playing WoW all the time.</div></div><hr />
