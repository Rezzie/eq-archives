Just a little background of where I'm at in the game. I'm training up maces now in Darkshore.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it's just me, but I just noticed after I switched to a mace that my melee attack rating in animal(currently bear) form is only one. This is the same as my melee attack rating with my equiped weapon. What gives? All guides and such say that if you're feral you'll rarely swing a weapon, but if that's true and you don't swing a weapon from the time you get bear form you won't be able to hit the broad side of a barn come endgame. And you gain no weapon skill points while in animal form. If someone would clear this up for me that would be great. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanaburs</div><div class="date">07-14-2006, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I'm currently level 16 and I have 60 skill points in Staves with the max being 80. I don't recall what my attack rating in Bear form was, but once I switched to a Mace it dropped to 1 with a max of 80 in Bear form(we all know it drops to 1 in NE form so that's no big deal). Now after grinding my Mace skill in and NE and Bear attack ratings are 75 out of a possible 80. <br />
<br />
Now if I'm reading you right my attack rating in Feral form should always be max for my level, which at lvl 16 would be 80. Sadly that isn't the case here. I don't know if it's a glitch with me or if it's everyone. I'd say give it a try with a weapon type you haven't trained much in and report your finding. Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
<br />
And for the record I don't mind grinding I just find Moonkin and collect Light Feathers for cash. It's just something that's really bothering me.<br />

[EDIT]<br />
<br />
I just tested the same thing on another Druid with the same result and that person was shocked as well. She was 12 points shy of the max for her level and when unarmed her Melee Attack Rating went down to 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
[EDIT] <br />
<br />
OK, so I figured it out. Even though the displayed value for your attack rating doesn't change in the Character window when shapeshifting, it IS actually max for your level. Kind of annoying, being as every stat in the character window is displayed with the new values from when you shift except that one. It's so mesed up since everything changes except for maybe resistances and that's the only one where the change isn't displayed. They need to fix that, ASAP.<br />
<br />
I tested this by unequiping my weapon and goin after a thistle bear. Same AP with and without the weapon equiped(displayed as 75 and 1 respectively mind you).</div></div><hr />
