<br />
In my regular group, I heal and do damage about equally.  When grouped with other guildies, it works out about the same.  Sometimes, I do more damage.  Other times I heal more.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's why I prefer playing a druid over my cleric.  I get to be more than just a wizard or just a cleric.  and to be honest?  I don't like being forced into a role where I can only nuke or I can only heal.</div></div><hr />

However I refuse to be a crutch to a cleric.  If im grouped with a cleric that thinks im going to cover them on heals because they are lazy they are seriously wrong and will find out fast.  I take pride in my healing (especially my assist healing) but I wont let clerics use me.  Id rather use my mana for dps over healing anyday.</div></div><hr />

I also can deal out damage in a nuker role as well, but I would never suggest I can out-damage a &quot;real&quot; nuker.<br />
 <br />
Where I think I have significant value, it is my ability to adjust to different circumstances.  I can heal and DoT and Nuke all at the same time.  My DoTs are varied, as are my Nukes, so in areas where one doesn't work well I can vary them &quot;on the fly&quot; and adjust to changes.  In this respect, I think Druids excel over all classes, but that's just my opinion and I don't consider it worthwhile to engage in &quot;mine's bigger than yours&quot; debate.  <br />
 <br />
In addition, my port abilities when done with a mission or raid or group are almost always useful.  My buffs are always in much demand.  And my evac and succor capability, together with my Spirit of Wood aa's have saved my group many, many times.<br />
 <br />
All told, I think Druids are the most fun to play since you can always vary things if you start to get jaded or bored.  All that said, nothing I say is meant to detract or put down any other class.  My most enjoyable times are when in a group and we enter a new zone and find that our standard modes of grouping are not working, and we adjust, change spells or our tactics to adjust to the new situation and overcome the difficulty.  This requires creativity, concentration, and courage.  Nothing is more enjoyable than overcoming a situation where you thought all was lost!  And Druids are better at this than almost any class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's been a while since I've grouped with a cleric who really needed me to spot, maybe I've just gotten lucky with all the overcautious ones. Normally, he / she heals until out of mana, then I heal while he / she meds, then I got back to dotting.<br />
<br />
But eesh, I remember the groups where there was a cleric, but I was doing pretty much all the healing for one reason or another. I'm not sad to see those days fade, not one bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I retired my cleric and became a druid.  While The icy lands of Velious had just been discovered by some crazy gnomes on a METAL BOAT?!?! (WTF!!! Who'da thunk metal could float!) I was being mentored by a very wise halfling.  Being a young halfing myself, I was eager to learn from this elder.. (and he had PIE!)<br />
<br />
He taught me that we are of much use in a raid setting, and while we can smite mobs with the powers Karana has granted to us, once we get to 50-40% mana, to hold off in reserve some, because we can't fully rely on a cleric to do thair job.<br />
<br />
These days I heal 80% of the time.. Clerics are becomming more and more scarce, generally being a twink, or someone's boxxed alt. =(<br />
<br />
What I get my druids to do? Debuff and heal or nuke.<br />
<br />
With Moonshadow added in, I like to use a druid to watch a group's health and debuff/DPS.  Only when we are definately short on clerics will a druid step in to heal. While in a group setting I am a healer 99.99% of the time,  but rarely I do team up with a cleric, then we take turns being healer and DPS... and that makes a happy druid AND a happy cleric ;)<br />

<br />
Thats the great thing about Druids, as has been said many times before, we can swap into DPS or Heal modes at will, as needed, not to mention buffing, porting, and just being damn sexy while we stand around waiting on the non-druids to catch up.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Depends though, in raids I basically only heal...<br />
 <br />
In groups it is usualy as healer, but I like dps'ing best- although not often I get to do it=)<br />

<br />
I could get lots of groups if I wanted to be primary healer, but I personally don't think druids heal well enough (fast enough or mana-efficient enough) in a non-trivial setting.  In a group, I nuke; sometimes DoT if the killing is slow enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamdaru</div><div class="date">09-27-2006, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on what raid we are doing whether i heal or dps. I love to be grouped with a cleric so i can dps, and in my guild that can happen alot. <br />
 <br />
I will occasionally get stuck with that lazy cleric and if i find out right away that is what is happening, i will forget every heal in my spell line up and put nukes there. Lazy clerics are useless clerics imo. <br />
 <br />
I am asked to main heal alot in groups too, and nowadays its easy, but i too am spoiled by the tanks in my guild. I love our versatility as a class to do whatever the group needs. I have played about every class up to level 35 or so. My druid still is my main =).<br />

I play my cleric if I want to main heal. On raids however, it is mostly healing though, since I seem to get all the suicidal groups.<br />
<br />
But for exp or whatever, I nuke. Rarely dot these days cos I'm lacking fire and magic foci, and blowing things up is just much more fun anyway. I shoulda made a wizzy.</div></div><hr />
