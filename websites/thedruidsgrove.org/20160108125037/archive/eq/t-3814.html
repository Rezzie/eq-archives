I don't get how they have 9, when there are 4 druid races (wood elf, human, halfling, half-elf), so there should be probably 8 or 12 in order to achieve equal number among the races.<br />
<br />
But then again, wood elves rule so there are probably 3 wood elves in the Nine, while the rest of the inferior races only have 2 representatives. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Silvered/Sylvaned Tree is Sobe Silvertree (1): Champagne™<br />
<br />
Sirocco is Scirocco (2): Sickle <br />
Though Scirocco is a human druid in actuality.<br />
<br />
Fox's Fyre is Foxfyre (3): Idol<br />
<br />
Gosselin (4): Fishing rod<br />
<br />
Paldor (5): Stein  <br />
<br />
Running Wolf (6): Robe<br />
friend of Rebecca Cabbageleaf<br />
<br />
Sorrun (7), piemaker<br />
<br />
Rebecca Cabbageleaf aka Lotusfly (8): Picnic, Lucky Cabbage<br />
<br />
<br />
You know I'm right:<br />
<br />
However, you can perhaps try too,<br />
By making the Nine sacrificing true,<br />
In a fiery furnace of suitable heat,<br />
A smiths forge, perhaps, your needs will meet,<br />
<br />
You forge together the Nine [gifts] to make your earring and spell.</div></div><hr />

I love how the gifts each has a significance, it's own particular meaning.<br />
<br />
What else would one use for trolling?<br />
<br />
/smile<br />
<br />
<br />
I was always confused about Sylvaned Tree.<br />
I don't think that is Sobe.<br />
Someone else who we here don't know, perhaps.<br />
<br />
All in all, I think it is the zenith(epitome) of what a good quest should be.<br />
There should be more like them.<br />
<br />
And I still say that 'liber' translates better to english as 'manual', rather than 'book'.<br />

He came forward [from the throng] carrying the bottle of champagne then stepped back.<br />
<br />
There came a tall elf named Sylvaned Tree,<br />
Carrying a bottle bigger even then me [Rebecca]!<br />
Of workmanship it was most refined,<br />
the jewelled bottle well definied.<br />
The bottle itself was first created,<br />
from magical gold, with opal mated,<br />
<br />
With a glass bottle, by jeweller skilled,<br />
what gorgeous craft with drink to be filled.<br />
Once bottle crafted, now came this brew:<br />
Using the magnum, wine yeast, and double grapes too,<br />
With a little soda water mixed to taste,<br />
Not a drop of liquid gone to waste.<br />
<br />
With these fine ingrediants five,<br />
The result was a champagne for which to strive!<br />
In order to mix the soda water,<br />
Ye should seek out Mudhand's Daughter.<br />
Thus water and soda should ye simply mix,<br />
To produce more fizz than Fizzlepop's six!<br />
<br />
The elves do brewing in varying strengths,<br />
adding more or less grapes, such lengths!<br />
However this drink requires grapes just two,<br />
Though using one or three can taste fine too.<br />
With gift upon the fire overturned,<br />
Back to the throng Silvered Tree returned.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Aye, you might be right, just like the reference to Summer's Wind.<br />
<br />
Or, The Lucky Cabbage.<br />

Is Xanthe considered one of the 9, or the tenth mentioned?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the context of the section, read these concluding verses:<br />
<br />
With gift upon the fire overturned,<br />
Back to the throng Silvered Tree returned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Back to the throng&quot; and &quot;returned&quot; indicate that the subject made previous actions. You have to have separated yourself from the group in order to return to it or go back to it, and the only one doing that is Silvered Tree. The implied referent is revealed by the verbs and their inherent chronology, not by the name of the character. There is simply no other referent in this section. &quot;Sylvaned Tree&quot; [cf. Silvanus] could be seen as a play on &quot;Silv.&quot; I mention Silvanus because god of the forest, god of the grove/woods, is the position that Sobe Silvertree has in this textual grove. I don't know any other &quot;EQ&quot; Silvanus other than Elial and Spiritual. <br />
<br />
Xanthe isn't considered one of the nine because the nine is the gifts, not the druids per se. She would be the ninth druid mentioned in the last Liber text, but she had no offering to sacrifice.</div></div><hr />

With the Cabbage quest, Verant put in the backstory of Nine gifts/druids as the source of Protection of the Cabbage.    Referring to the &quot;Nine&quot; in the name of the &lt;em&gt;upgrades&lt;/em&gt; to Protection of the Cabbage (and the more generically named group version) seems a pretty obvious connection to me.</div></div><hr />

Yes. There were nine. The text did not specify who the nine were. The earring quest nine is still eight druids, so I am wondering who the ninth is supposed to be. &quot;The Nine&quot; is the gifts, and by metonymy, it refers to the druids bearing gifts, but as I indicated, Cabbageleaf bore two, so that makes her number eight and nine all in one.

&quot;Silvered Tree&quot; is Sobe.  EQTraders.com lists &quot;Sylvan'd Tree&quot; in one section from poor translation; as is my understanding, the reader was not a Master in the language in which the book is encoded (Faerie) and utilised the oft error-prone translation method of repeatedly opening and closing the book in order to derive the original text.  ^_~<br />
<br />
Head to Faraniel Leafsway, in Northern Felwithe, with Master skill in Faerie and the correct translation shall be revealed to you.  ^_^<br />
<br />
Not all the druid references have been &quot;spoiled&quot; yet, either!  I would encourage cunning linguists to chat a little in the Plane of Justice: there was a list of NPC dialogues on the Safehouse, but they consisted mainly of &quot;humanoid&quot;-faction conversations.  There are two factions of prisoners in the zone, and the &quot;monster&quot; faction conversations are largely undocumented... and considerably more interesting.  You never know what you might find...  Boom!  ^_))<br />
