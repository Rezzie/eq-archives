Last night I was tooling around Astranar (27 Druid) and I happen accross a 24 Tauren Warrior.  So I think &quot;sweet!  Gonna kill me a Warrior&quot;..  <br />
<br />
So I root him, moonfire, starfire, root again, moonfire one more time and then root breaks.  He is down to less than half helath now.  I switch to cat thinking i'll just slice him up the rest of the way.  Well at this point I'm not too sure what happend.  He may have popped a heal potion but I cant swear to it.  When he gets to me he basically just choppes me up with his 2 axes and walks away.<br />
<br />
WTF?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean.... I HAD him... and he was 3 levels below me.<br />
<br />
Should I have gone into bear instead of Cat?<br />

Their dps is high, so cat form won't keep you alive long enough to do anything.  Almost always bear against a warrior</div></div><hr />

I fought a 51 warrior.  He had some decent gear on but I got a little cocky and went cat (had feral gear on).  Bad move.  The warrior basically 4 shotted me.  Wow.  alt+f4.  Always start of bear unless you can get the jump on them first.  But even then, switch over to bear asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainlight</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only time I'll ever go cat on a warrior is to jump them.  Pounce &gt; Faerie Fire &gt; Shred &gt; Rip and switch out to  bear form immediately or they'll tear you up. Killing people in bearform is slow but you live a lot longer then the few seconds it takes them to kill you in cat form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea....that is all good advice.  Cat form against warriors for the entire fight will not get you a win.  Of course if you start the fight sneaking or root em and cast for a bit until the roots break that's great....then once the roots break go for bear form.  I find it hard to mess with Warriors.  <br />
<br />
I was proud when I finally beat my bf in a duel.  He's a rogue and has more experience with the rogue and I do with a druid.  So when I finally beat him I was so happy.  On the other server we played on I was able to beat his rogue with my Shadow priest once I got shadowform.</div></div><hr />

Against warriors roots is your best freind so remember you can root them 3 times i think before they will become immune so use that to your advantage. Once you have them rooted try not to use moonfire right away because it has a greater chance of breaking roots than starfire or wrath. This can allow you to get in 2 or 3 more wraths before root breaks then hit em with a moonfire, and then most definately go bear.</div></div><hr />

It's so easy to level up I don't know why people would, but it's possible. That could be why you got 2 shotted too. I'm also curious about you're gear? Are you geared up mainly for dps? I've always favored the armor with sta, or at least keep some sta armor on hand for when I want to pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kireth</div><div class="date">02-07-2006, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well at the time I mainly took whatever gear I could get or make.  I am 30 now but I guess if I had to say what I had most of it would be str, sta, agi gear.  I am leaning more feral atm but I do recognize the benifit of having a good mana pool.<br />
<br />
I have done a bit of research on warriors since then and if the warrior had done his ability to counter attack all my attacks that would explain the quick death but really I think it was my inexperience in PvP in WoW more than anything.  <br />
<br />
Its alot different than PvP in Everquest as a Paladin lol..<br />

<br />
But anyway.. there are so many factors involved when you PvP so maybe you did everything right but just got unlucky.. happens to me all the time. :)<br />
<br />
also: never go on low health against a war.. as he could just execute you.. gg pretty much. Be sure to try and keep yourself on high hp as much as possible even if this means you are ditching dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got lucky once and did a quick grab when other people were distracted, but haven't had such luck in last 20 attempts or so.  My guild has about 7 60s now and they are trying to help me out, but we are having trouble coordinating all our efforts in the relative free for all.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any good group strategies for capturing the chest.  The hardest part is that I have to loot the chest to get the trinket, and I'm our weakest member.  Also, we are a cross faction guild and are trying to use both Horde and Alliance characters at the same time using Yahoo Messenger with Voice.<br />
<br />
Any tips would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
