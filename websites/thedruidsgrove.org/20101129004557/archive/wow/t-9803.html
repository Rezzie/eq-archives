I was looking for a nice place for Druids to talk about stuff....or just chit chat.  This place seemed like it might fit what I was wanting....so I signed up.  Just wanted to say hello to all of you.<br />
<br />
I have 2 druid toons....but I have recently switched servers so I have only been playing one actively.  They have become my favorite class to play now....especially in WSG.<br />
<br />
Anyways....it's nice to meet you guys....and I look forward to many fun conversations with you guys.</div></div><hr />

Lots of great info here - I found this site when I was about lv 34, and the info / advice has helped me become a much better druid.  I am now 53, and loving being a druid.</div></div><hr />
