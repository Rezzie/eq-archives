<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bigskyn</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My druid is almost to 50 and looking ahead to acquiring spells through drops and/or bazzar. The purpose of this post is to get some feedback on which spells (yes through 65) that are the hardest to find and/or buy. Seems that prices vary significantly on my server and I would be nice to know when I should pay an arm-and-leg for a spell. Your help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gatori Vonhinx</div><div class="date">04-21-2003, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to find:<br />
<br />
Level 50<br />
Improved Sup Camo - and worth it until you get innate camo, then it has no value at all<br />
<br />
Level 51 <br />
Levitation<br />
Enduring Breath<br />
<br />
Level 54<br />
RGC - unless you are in a guild that regularly kills Luclin names, don't expect to see it ever.<br />
<br />
Level 58<br />
RotG - if you aren't doing HoT (or theoretically Kael arena, but leather is sickly rare there), this is a good buy.<br />
<br />
Level 59<br />
Legacy of Thorn - decent, I suppose.  Not worth the cost.<br />
Spirit of the Oak - pointless<br />
<br />
Level 60<br />
Nearly all are rough, potg and banishment seem fairly commonly sold though, so pick them up.  The only other ones that are really worth getting are moonfire and mask of hunter/stalker.  All the rest of the spells are absolutely valueless unless you desire a full spellbook.  <br />
<br />
Level 61+ spells follow a different format, as I am sure you have seen elsewhere.  You turn in ethereals (61-62), spectrals (63-64) or runes (65).  It seems as if some of the spells are more commonly received than others, but I really didn't do a large enough sample to say for certain.  The 61-62 spells are all easily obtained by a solo druid of the appropriate level, whether it be various names in PoD or PoN or from trash mobs in third tier planes.  Even if you have difficulty getting some of these spells, all of them are cheaper to buy than most level 58-60 spells.<br />
<br />
Level 63 to 64 are where things get rough.  The vast majority of these spells drop from third tier (or better, I would guess) bosses and mini-bosses so they tend to be much rarer and much more expensive.  If your luck on rolls (and HoH drops) is as poor as mine, you will find yourself buying quite a few of these.  On the Rathe, the commons run in the 5K to 10K range and the rares will cost 50K (pot9, cot).<br />
<br />
Level 65 spells are also available from tier 3 bosses and above, but are even rarer.  Unless you are in a high-end guild (which, at level 50 I figure you are not), don't expect to see very many of these until they start to dribble down from the big guilds . . . something that really hasn't started yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regrowth of the Grove, is worth buying even if you get the kael/SS BP only cause you don't always have your armor.  (CR's)<br />
<br />
Protection of the Glades, Moonfire, Mask of the Stalker.  Buy the indoor/outdoor version of mask first.  The other two are must haves though.<br />
<br />
All of your level 60 spells drop from Kunark Dragons with some of them dropping from jugs in Seb.<br />
<br />
Levitation, EB, and RGC are now starting to show up from &quot;research&quot; on Morell Thule.  Just be patient and look for them.<br />

<br />
In a few months, once the casters get most of their spells, and the market floods with extras, you should see more of the priest spells popping up for sale as extra comps start rolling in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People said this about lev/eb/rgc when luclin came out, &quot;give it a few months for the raid guilds to fill up and start selling them&quot;<br />
<br />
Guess what?<br />
<br />
They're still stupid rare, only now, not only is the spell itself rare, so are the components to make it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must be kidding.  About a year ago I farmed Skyshrine for a Wurm Lord Shawl, and I got several backpacks worth of Improved Superior Camo.  There wasn't much demand for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">04-22-2003, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would've paid 5k for it if I hadn't found it for 12pp on a vendor.<br />
<br />
The big problem is that while yes, it's *worth* 5k, a lot of level 50 people don't *have* 5k to spend on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrystofC</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Improved Superior Camo drops off shardwurm guardians in GD as well.  Take a group there, and you'll have several copies of level 50 spells for other classes too (improved invis, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interestingly enough today on MT, Improved superior Camo still sells for 5kpp.<br />
<br />
Every server has a slightly different economy though depending on who's farming what...<br />
<br />
The reason the &quot;Raiding Guilds&quot; never started selling, Lev, EB, and RGC?<br />
<br />
Typically turnover in these guilds meant that not everyone got the spells, ever.<br />
<br />
Further Levitation and Everlasting Breath drop from mobs that no raiding guild ever targets.  But are pain in the ass single mob camps with rare drops.  I've killed the mob for EB 10 times this weekend and no drop yet.<br />
<br />
Researched versions of these spells will ease this over time.  Nothing overnight.  Spell research components showing up in the bazaar are carrying rediculous prices, but are coming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also to the original poster, once you hit level 53 and get winged death, if you can't find the spells you are looking for try running the named cycle in Skyfire, youll get quite a few spells and the druid ones are rather common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Opivvy</div><div class="date">04-28-2003, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The level 60 AE Root rocks, I don't understand why people fail to see this spell as being valuable.  Great for pulling if you can't harmony and have more than 3 mobs huddled around, root em all, toss on snare and then throw on a regular root.  The time it worked best was when I was in Sol coming up to Neirot for the gale weaver quest and tossed root on all the fire giants around him.  They all stuck too and Neirot came solo cause he's unrootable :)</div></div><hr />

Like that chanter selling Everlasting Breath for 8kpp.  I'm killing vampires looking for that spell and have 5k from that so far.  Sooner or later one of the punks is gonna cough up a spell.<br />

<br />
The irony of it is that, assuming you're in an elemental-flagged guild, runes (level 65 spells) are at least 10x more common than spectrals (level 63-64) spells.  I've had all my 65 spells for some time now but I'm still missing some 63-64 spells.  Most of the other casters in my guild are in the same boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkturus D</div><div class="date">04-30-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe i found 5 yaeth's compendium pages 70 (left side) on a vender for 5 pp each and sold them for 350 pp each  <br />
<br />
but yes, 8kpp - 9kpp for everlasting breath and 15k for levitation.... are these people mad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Levitation would ONLY be worth it to me if I could cast it indoors, and I'm not about to pay 15k to learn that.<br />
<br />
Everlasting Breath?  Well, I would use it on raids to keep others alive.  I have 3 different Perm EB Items I can put on.  Not worth 8k to me to stop people from dying in PoWater.  Fish Scales are cheap yanno... and its great when they are drowning looking for a corpse in the middle of a rock while 50 people are on top of the rock and are begging for EB when you say... Sorry, no fish scales.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gatori Vonhinx</div><div class="date">05-01-2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Levitation is castable indoors.  <br />
<br />
I would seriously recommend those considering buying it to consider camping it instead.  Pre-PoP, I went in with a single group and farmed up two copies over the course of a couple hours.  It was considered good AA at the time too (probably not anymore LOL).</div></div><hr />
