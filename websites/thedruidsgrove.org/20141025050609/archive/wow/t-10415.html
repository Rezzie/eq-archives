<br />
I was wondering how dishonorable kills work.  say you have Dishonorable Kills.  Does that affect your ability to Rank quickly in the future??? or do dishonorable kills only hurt you when you already have a rank, and then you kill dishonorably??? can dishonorable kills done in the past before you were ranked hurt you later, even if you've stopped killing dishonorably?</div></div><hr />

They do not send your honor into the negative.  I think the demotion would occur on the Tuesday still.  Not sure if that happens 'on the fly'.<br />

 Just my 2 coppers, but I think that DK's should not even exist. If anything make those certain NPC's non killable. Give them infinit hp's or crazy regen or some, because things like that are whats killing open world pvp.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, the only reason to not get DK if is you are trying to get a higher rank because you want the pvp rewards.<br />
<br />
If you don't want the stuff, get all the DKs you can get.  It's so much more fun to not play &quot;by the rules&quot; set up by Blizzard.  I play on a pvp server to fight and when the opportunity is there (players not around) npc's become the next target.  Personally, I think one of the best ways of messing with your opposing faction is to kill the npc's they need.</div></div><hr />

QFT.  Oh, and make them stop spawning guards :( Its no fun when you stealth up the Grom Gol zep tower, get on a zeppelin, ravage shred and FB all crit, and then when you jump down some civilian spawns 100000000000000000000 gurads to kill you.</div></div><hr />
