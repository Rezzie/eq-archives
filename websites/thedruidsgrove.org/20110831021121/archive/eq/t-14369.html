I am trying to max out my tailoring and I think I figured out a way to help my fellow druids.  I currently have a tailoring skill of 262 with trophy tailoring mastery of level 3 and salvage of level 3.  If you would like the grandmaster's brambleborn armor made for you just get the pieces and I will try am make it. If you are interested please send me an e-mail in game and we can talk. Their is a chance of failure but I have had good success in the past.  My character's name in game is Laythorn on the server above.</div></div><hr />
