Just an FYI, this turned out to be one of those fun things that ends up being a lot more complicated than it looks on the surface.  It's going to require a code change to correct so won't make the patch this week but I'm expecting it should be available for the patch after that.<br />

Can you please use the same code for Illusion : Fairy too please? They're huge when you use the illusion too.<br />
<br />
The change we have to make would fix that problem too.  The problem is that there is no way to specify height on an illusion so the models use the default height which either has to be hardcoded per model or defaults to the standard human size (6 foot).  Illusions that change size, like gnome, have a hard code inserted that override the height.  The change we're making will allow us to specify default size by model in data so we can set that information for all models and fix this problem with all illusions.<br />

Sounds great, Rashere - a universal implementation is always better than a quick fix for a couple of instances.<br />
<br />
However it has always troubled me that when gnome necroes lich they turn into human-sized skellies, surely they should be gnome-sized skellies <br />
<br />
Although I'm not sure if the code would support illusions (which the skelly form is) to be scaled to player height as many people use illusions specifically for size adjustment.  At least they can shrink back to gnome-size.  It's just amusing to see gnomes release the inner skelly and wonder about gnome bodies being larger on the inside than on the outside...<br />
<br />
It wouldn't cover that, but I'm actually ok with that particular case for the same reason that I feel when you change into a brownie, you should change size.  I view the illusion as a totality, which includes the height of the creature you are turning into, rather than just changing some portion of your character.  So, its not just Illusion: Skeleton, its Illusion: 6-Foot Skeleton with Flaming Red Eyes.<br />

All wolf forms are now massive.  Spells, AA, pets - everything.  Could it be returned to its previous normal size please.<br />
<br />

Oooh, that's actually good news...that means at least part of the change is out there and I might be able to update the rest without needing to wait for the next patch.  That'd be nice.<br />

No such luck.  It'll have to wait until the next patch unfortunately.<br />
