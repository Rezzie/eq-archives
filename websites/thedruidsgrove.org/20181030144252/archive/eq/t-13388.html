 Mini Guide to Barkspur<br />
<br />
     <br />
<br />
This task pops up with you looting a skin from red-con mobs in Devastation, named in Sverag or any mob in Ragethorn. As soon as you loot the skin a task will pop up in your screen (Saga Skins) - you get it automatically. There is no npc to request this task from.<br />
<br />
This will grant you a single task -NOT a group one- to collect skin samples from different model mobs from Plane of Rage. You need to collect a total of NINE skins. You can do your farming either in Devastation or Sverag... as long as you do red-con Named (in Sverag) or red-con Captains/leaders (In devastation), these are what drop the skins. They also drop from just about everything in Razorthorn if you have access.<br />
<br />
<br />
 I. Where to get skins from?<br />
<br />
The Devastation<br />
<br />
In Devastation look for red cons called &quot;an elite&quot;, &quot;an elite soldier&quot;, &quot;a centurian&quot;, &quot;a dark initiate&quot;. etc. Watch the camps and troops in Devastation as they wipe out other camps, they will spawn new races. Sometimes these red-con will pop up. They spawn at a higher rate close to the Stronghold and around it. They can be soloed, the tedious part is getting them alone. Stay out of range, cast snare on the red-con... then run as far as you can and egress or exodus. Then go back and see if he's solo - rinse and repeat if he isn't. You can also try and cast Nature's Serenity on his friends and then pull him from a distance as quickly as you can, but this technique didn't work for me well enough (they warp all around and end up agroing others). Pull them to the Stronghold walls so you don't get adds. They break root often so keep on alert, and also watch for trains - don't stick particularly close to the Stronghold door (because of trains), though the side camps are fine for soloing.<br />
<br />
You can also check the outer walls. Sometimes lines of mobs stand there and red-cons pop. The red con eye was particularly abundant here. I did the harmony thing, ensnare the red come... if friends followed i ran and evac'ed. Then you can go back and get the red con alone.<br />
<br />
Some of these mobs can summon. A list of these mobs include Red con Werewolves &quot;A Ravager&quot; and &quot;An Elder&quot;, Red-con Drachnids and &quot;a basher&quot; which should be a troll red con. Red con Shiliskin, Kobolds, Orcs and Evil Eyes do not summon. <br />
<br />
For a complete list of mobs' names see Fenier's thread here (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13460).<br />
<br />
<br />
Sverag, Stronghold of Rage<br />
<br />
In Sverag (the stronghold)look for easy named such as &quot;The Subjugator&quot;. The best camp area is near the instance door. If you can get a group around that area they can pull &quot;the subjugator&quot; as well as a white con that spawns right beside the door. Both of these drop skins. Even if they aren't the race you need, they mostly drop Bolvirk skins but can also drop others that aren't of their particular race.<br />
<br />
<br />
Razorthorn<br />
<br />
Like I mentioned earlier, if you have a group with access to these instances, you can hunt here for the skins. The skins have a 80% chance of dropping of trash here. NOTE: The task will not pop up here if you do not have any skin, you can only get the task from looting skins in Devastation or Sverag.<br />
<br />
<br />
II. Complete List of Skins<br />
<br />
The complete list of skins you need is as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Bolvirk - Scarred Bolvirk Skin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88069)<br />
2) Undead - Mummified Pigmented Skin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88070)<br />
3) Kobold - Patch of Dyed Kobold Fur (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88071)<br />
4) Orc - Torn and Tattooed Orc Flesh (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88072)<br />
5) Evil Eye - Inked Evil Eye Hide (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88073)<br />
6) Wurines - Decorated Wurine Hide (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88074)<br />
7) Drachnid - Etched Drachnid Carapace (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88075)<br />
8) Shilliskin - Tattooed Shiliskin Skin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88076)<br />
9) Berserkers/Vah Shir - Scarred and Tattooed Skin (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88077)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
III. Who to give the skins to<br />
<br />
After you got all the skins, take them to Grand Librarian Maelin in the top of the library in Plane of Knowledge.<br />
<br />
He will give you pages for each skin sample you give him. Combine the total 9 skins in a Book Binding and you should get a book. Turn in this book for your spell. You need an open top inventory slot for the Book Binding, you can get it on East Freeport, Corathus, and most home cities. Here's a list with buying locations (http://www.eqtraders.com/items/show_item.php?item=19421&amp;menustr=035000000000)<br />
<br />
He then tells you,<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Well, these are very interesting! I've learned a lot from the things you have brought me, so I wanted you to have this.'<br />
<br />
You get Barkspur.<br />
<br />
Cleric: Elixir if Divinity<br />
Ranger: Scorched Earth<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Correct name of spell is: Barkspur. - Ruadh[/I]</div></div><hr />

Any skin that has a lore item tag, no drop tags... <br />

Is there a task to obtain first?  If so from who?  If not, who do you see to obtain the task once you have one looted, or does the task appear auto magically upon looting one of said skins?<br />

Has anyone else experienced severe difficulty in finding red-con Bolvirks spawning in Devastation? I have spent hours at the Rage zone, and have not seen any Bolvirks near there. There is a camp of four, south of the Rage zone, but they are all DB, and respawn as DB. There are a few camps on the outer circumference of the zone, but they spawn on top of each other in groups of 20+; all yellow cons.<br />
 <br />
I have found it impossible to finish this mission. Is it bugged? Is there any way to camp them inside Rage? How does one change the races that control rage, in order to camp them? Are Bolvirks a possible controlling race?<br />
 <br />
These are the only boards that I have found with any discussion whatsoever of this quest to date.</div></div><hr />

Uh, not necessarily.  On Emarr server it's the Kobolds that control Sverag.  It depends on which race is in power at the current time.  There are a couple of raid type missions I have heard about that allow players to aid another race to take over, but so far no one has changed it from the Kobolds on Emarr.<br />
<br />
I spent all day watching the battles on the field in The Devastation yesterday and we obtained 54 of the skins needed for our group.  As the patrols march through the center of the fields they happen upon an enemy and proceed to do their best to wipe each other out.  Camps are cleared and there will soon be a new race spawn to take over the spot.  <br />
<br />
I watched three different &quot;camp&quot; areas plus the surrounding wall spawns go from Brolvirk to drachnid to undead to eyes to .... well, you get the idea. Each area seems to be random as well as the patrols, I didn't get a sense of any 'patterns' but I was only there 12 hours.  If you keep a camp cleared you will very likely see your target race sooner or later.</div></div><hr />

Actually... An orc named was the one that dropped my Bolvirk skin. Called The Subjucator. Goblins and Orcs control Sverag in Maelin. Call it weird but it's true.<br />

I am having the problem as you cannot find any red con giants, been there for hours on end, have seen one spawn in about 8 hours of farming and it didnt even drop it. so i think quest is bugged or someone is leaving out some info <br />
<br />
I think Kaidman got all his from devastation so I was skeptical about this, however I got mine from Sverag, so I wouldn't know for sure. Which is why due to these posts I made the change temporarily. But since you have cleared this up then I will edit it yet again.</div></div><hr />

We trained one race onto another after we got the squad leaders pulled and killed.  We kept a rotation going on all the surrounding camps, and while the giants are difficult spawns to clear, there were times when we had many more giants than we wanted.   LOL<br />

I believe the part of the point in this zone is that we, as players, can take an active role in the battlefields to aid one race to overcome another.</div></div><hr />

As far as the  The Subjugated is concerned, inside the tower, if you read the books you received back from Maelin once you get your spell, that individual character appears to be 'elected/appointed/chosen' to the title for it's ability to channel it's rage and then sent out to expend it's rage in battles.

Oh geesh, yea, uhm heh  /blush...  I registered here when I was playing Ahlanna, 65 Druid, now semi-retired.   I mostly play, these days, as Tehya, 70 Shaman on EMarr..    Hope you don't mind that I am a forever Druid lovin' Shaman?   <br />

I frequent these boards quite often to stay informed and appreciate the Druid class.<br />

Nearest I can tell we have probably some of the best recon/research collectives in the game.<br />
<br />
I just zoned into Devastation for the first time yesterday and put to use some of the information you all have already shared.  Very accurate and well done.<br />
<br />
One question:  Can you give me an approximate location of the red con mobs.  I found and  killed a few of the blue cons at the entrance.  <br />
<br />
~Blue con kills were fairly efficient mana wise.  Engaged a named blue con in the field (Shadowlord) and basically tanked him as he summoned.  No biggie and no real drop of consequence.  Engaged the yellow con Bolvik's.  The one I engaged was apparently a rogue with Tendonslice.  Fun stuff.  Singled me for 1400, doubled me for 900's and 500's and summoned.  Not a real feasible mob to kill and really no reason to other than experimenting with tactics.~<br />
<br />
Also, these apparently wer on some sort of faction as I noticed with all the kills, there were faction hits involved.  has nayone determined the importance of those yet?</div></div><hr />

We got the task stage complete/update messages but no messages on the task itself being created plus no update for further things to accomplish.  We think we unintentionally caused the server crash (all other servers were still up).  When we could get back in 15ish minutes later, there was an approximately 10 minute rollback on our characters.  Approximately an hour later the Server-Wide message stated that Maelin in PoK was taking a temporary leave of absence (not exactly, but similar).</div></div><hr />

Yes, read above the guide, i added that in red text this morning.<br />
<br />
Apparently some folks found a way to exploit it and give spells to their entire guilds. I'm thinking the book wasn't no drop and they just passed it around their friends and they turned it in to get more spells.<br />
<br />
Additionally some servers have been crashing on the task after that one. <br />
<br />
One question: Can you give me an approximate location of the red con mobs. I found and killed a few of the blue cons at the entrance.<br />
<br />
I can't really, they are fairly close to Sverag walls, roaming around that area probably semi-close to the moat. Sometimes they are halfway from the outer wall to Sverag walls but most of the time they are closer to Sverag. There are even a few that spawn right in front of the door area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Once he's back up, if you give him the books to get your spell, he will no longer return them to you.  After our next patch, the books will be made No Trade.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Also, after the next patch the &quot;Bring me the head of...&quot; quests within Devastation will reward you with this spell drop as well.  The current quest will continue to reward the spell so those of you working on Razorthorne access can get the spell as you're working through it, but this quest wasn't originally designed to reward spell drops and is more time intensive than we'd like for access to those spells.<br />

I got my spell (Mages get Spear of Ro, btw). However, upon turning in the books, I was assigned a task &quot;Become the Vessel&quot;. This is a task, which requires looting of some no drop items in dev/rage/etc. However, it is shared, meaning that one cannot receive any other shared tasks while it is active, correct? And, with the books disappearing, one cannot ever get this quest again. So, it seems as if the patch has totally screwed us here. Is there any information available about this quest, what it does, if it is for progression etc? I'm just trying to understand what is going on here. :(</div></div><hr />

It has you go around looting and killing  for a lot of stuff. It will stay up for 24 hours if not finished before. And it does seem that you will have to get the skins quest again to get the &quot;Become the Vessel&quot; quest again. If you do that, keep in mind that with a single group, the Vessel quest takes a good few hours to complete.</div></div><hr />

Oh and also, the dark initates cast a very nasty snare, and re-cast as soon as i cured it, would need to be lucky on root holding is only way i can see to solo those.<br />

Inside rage facing in, go left.  Dont even break the door down.  Keep following that hallway.  If you look on your map the left middle most corner theres a drogmor named there that drops a 65/70/70 aug and a 50/50/50 shielding 2 aug.  He also drops the skin everytime.</div></div><hr />

If you complete saga skins, you can't get a new one.<br />

We had an issue with a cleric accidentally removing himself from his saga skins quest around 80% finished and unable to reactivate it.<br />

 <br />
The mob at the entrence in stronghold of rage (right behind the door) gives out a number of collect 4 quests. Doing any of those will get you your spell. Basically ever type of mob that drops a skin also has a chance to drop another no drop item, typically a body part. You get 4 of those and turn them in for the spell (they made it so you can get the parts first and task 2nd now too).<br />
 <br />
I got all the parts for mine from devestation, not sure if they drop in stronghold of rage as well (edit I did get an undead drop in stronghold - if you farm there though you'll probably have to do the turn in after the next control change). The drops are;<br />
 <br />
Bolvirk - Bolvirk ear<br />
Undead - Undead legionaire's skull<br />
Kobald - Kobald paw<br />
Orc - Bloody orc head<br />
Evil Eye - Evil eye central oculus<br />
Wurine - Wurine paw<br />
Drachnid - Drachnid head<br />
Shiliskin - Shiliskin feeding tentacle<br />
Berserkers - Stone war axe <br />
 <br />
The berserkers seemed like the best ones to go after. Troll bashers summoned but were still soloable, otherwise it was easy to pull packs of zerkers to the wall snaring them along the way then root dot them. Drop rate seemed good, especially for the vah shirs. Ended up pulling like 3 or 4 packs of them total maybe to get 4 axes.</div></div><hr />
