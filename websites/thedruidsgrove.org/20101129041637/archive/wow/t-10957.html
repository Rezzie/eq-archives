I was at work on a Friday, working my butt off, and Fridays and Sundays are our guild's MC days. I come back, and they say &quot;Hey Kinma, look what dropped&quot;, only to reveal an oh-so beautiful Cenarion Belt and Helm. Here's the kicker; NO DRUIDS IN THE RAID! So they both got DEed! /cry<br />

Tell us any stories of how you've missed out on items because of work!</div></div><hr />

He was called in for work yesterday and it dropped for the raid. Went to our tank for laughs because no one else needed it. I got mine running with another guild that needed a healer, got to roll on it, and won it :)</div></div><hr />

The only times I have available anymore are weekends, which means I miss most of the raids.<br />
<br />
So my story about what happened today isn't a missing loot story, but it is a work ftl story.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, so I'm about 2 weeks away from transfering back to the states from Japan.  I've got a lot of paperwork to do.  Everything that moving implies, except that now its half way across the world.  In addition I have things to tie up at work.  So I'm trying to set things up so my replacement can get a smooth transition into the gig.  My boss tells me to stop what I'm doing because I need to help plan some things for next week.  Well thing is, I'm not even going to be at work next week as this is my last couple days.  And as I said, I'm trying to finish up my loose ends.  Basically I was told that what I was doing wasn't important and to shut up and color.<br />
<br />
Well I'm pretty pissed, also this was about an hour before I was supposed to get off today and my boss (who actually had been gone pretty much the entire day) had just informed me that no I won't be getting off and in fact I will be working another 4 hours.  All this is going in my head and I'm just thinking how easy it would be for me to break his fast, tub-o-lard body.  It really would have been.  But the triumphant Buddhist that I am decided to seek more peaceful means and chose to talk it over with him after work.<br />
<br />
So here we are, I'm bringing my frustrations to him face to face; a manly conversation.  After all that's all most guys want is to just be told straight out if there is a problem with them.  I informed him of the amount of load I have to accomplish before I leave and also how I am trying to work on their time.  Really I was, the last guy basically never showed up to work his last month there, and never bothered to train a replacement (something which is really causing severe after effects on the work center).  I really have been trying to be the good guy and handling personal business out of work, as well as trying to take the time and set them on a good track after I'm gone.<br />
<br />
Well I was basically told that I'm lazy, irresponsible and am just pissy because things are coming down to the last minutes and I'm asking for more time.  That I should have planned better (keep in mind I'm regularly putting in 12+ hours at work as is).  I was told that I should be staying extra hours with my replacement if I wanted to train him.  And that there was plenty of time on the weekend to train him as well.  I was lazy and should have been bring him in on weekends.  <br />
<br />
So anyways, now I'm in the mood like fuk that place and everyone there.  I really don't care that they are undermaned now with me leaving, or that there will be a strain because now I am not taking any further steps to set up a replacement in my space.  If I'm so irresponsible, I'm sure they will find a way to handle it.<br />
<br />
So in short.  When its time for you to leave, leave a good couple months early.  And never try to be the good guy.  People only respect @$$holes.<br />
<br />
Take care</div></div><hr />
