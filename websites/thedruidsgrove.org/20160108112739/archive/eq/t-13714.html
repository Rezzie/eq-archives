Jump down the hole (be prepared to fight and there's an ae dispel iirc too).  Find your way out of that area and you'll be at a building.  In the building there's a way to go down (I think it's down) and you'll go past where Velkator the Sorcerer lives and up some stairs.  There's a room there with ghosty things and gargoyles.  Basically clear that room until your Experiment spawns.<br />
<br />
*Note: I've only been down to that point twice and it's been a year since I did last so my memory of the place may not be 100% accurate (it's obviously not specific &gt;&lt;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went to the castle past the kobold tents and just killed the golems there until the Failed Experiment popped.<br />
<br />
I was able to solo everything in the area, including the Failed Experiment.</div></div><hr />
