<br />
I used to do a lot of PvP with my druid (who was feral and resto/feral at the time) but then did nothing for a very long time.  I'm starting to get back into it again, but haven't quite found my niche.  I'm not sure I want to spec specifically for PvP, because I do support my guild in KZ--where I have in the past done a lot of healing (ask me sometime about my 27/0/34 spec) but recently more DPS--and other ventures.  Right now I have a completely insane 31/30/0 hybrid build that completely cracks me up but I'm not sure is going to be viable long-term.  (Mostly I like it because I can swap gear around and go feral for long boss fights for sustained DPS and save my mana for spot healing/rezzing as needed.)<br />
<br />
So... talk to me. Show me your builds, tell me a little about tactics you like to use and hopefully I'll get a chance to try some of them out. In particular, my feral skills are lacking in PvP; I spend most of my time in caster form healing and nuking. I'd be particularly interested in hearing about strategies for taking out various classes from feral forms (what opening move to use from stealth, whether to stack bleeds or just keep clawing and biting, etc.).</div></div><hr />

I've done a couple BGs over the past weekend and have been involved in 2v1 and 1v1 encounters throughout. I guess with my build (1/41/19) it's vital that you make good use of your Maim / Cyclone and even roots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3v3 is:<br />
Me (Feral)<br />
Rogue<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
5v5 is:<br />
Me<br />
Priest<br />
Rogue<br />
2 Hunters<br />
<br />
<br />
Now none of us are PvP masters by any stretch...but we did 10 matches and only won 1......and I don't know why.<br />
<br />
Our strat was to tie up their biggest DPS &quot;threat&quot; with a sap while we work on the healer...from there we try to take out the DPS one by one.<br />
<br />
The only problem we came across was taking out the healer....it seemed like 80% of the time they got away and bubbled/shielded and then the team would take out our priest, then me...then clean up the rest.<br />
<br />
Any arena advice or are we just gimped as an Arena class?<br />
<br />
I really want that Mace and the Helm but I don't want to lose 10 matches a week for 3 months if I can help it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">06-26-2007, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the problem lies with you.<br />
<br />
In the 5v5 team the Hunters are pretty much useless and you only have one healer. If my team (Pala and Priest, both holy, Rogue, DPS-Warrior and Druid) would meet yours we'd cut you to shreds, and we are not a good team (we win more than we lose, but are far from a good rating).<br />
Especially since the changes to the PVP-trinket Hunters are breakfast in the arena.<br />
<br />
The 3v3 looks quite good. With 2 classes that can stealth you definitely should wait for the enemies to come to you and focus your damage on one enemy. That does not have to be their healer. If a Pally is in the other group we almost always just ignore him and kill the clothies first. Warriors should also be ignored, because the more you hit them the more damage they can deal.<br />
<br />
Generally it takes some time to become good in the arena. You need to get a feel for the different group setups you encounter and how to handle them. Also you need to learn what abilities, strengths and weaknesses your teammates have and how you can combine all of that most effectively. Just keep playing and in a few weeks time you will succeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nit666</div><div class="date">07-04-2007, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I done quite a few battlegrounds and had some matches in 2x2 arena with me (feral) and a holy/retribution paladin. We did ok in the arena winning about 1/2 the matches but had to abandon the team because of the pallies raiding schedule (he didn't want to respec for the arena every week). We found that that the paladin is generally targetted first and if i could cyclone one player then we could seperate them and take them one on one which worked quite well. My healing is pretty crap but I use tranquility in an emergency and then everyone is happy again (except my mana bar that is!). I'm about to start a 3x3 team with me, a frost mage and holy/protection paladin and I'll see how that goes, just waiting for the pally to level (68 and counting). <br />
<br />
In battlegrounds I've done ok, cyclone is better than i thought because it will break up groups a bit and can take out a healer quite effectively. Mangle produces great damage, and combined with fast darting movements in cat form then you can dish it out and create enough confusion to not get hit!<br />

One more thing: Eye of the storm was made for druids, a big open space with a flag in the middle ready for the plucking!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Swapping my &quot;not so good&quot; Feral gear with some of my &quot;primo&quot; healing gear and healing after a stun+cyclone helped the other 2 take out one damage dealer or even the healer (if it wasn't a pally)<br />
<br />
2. Stay stealthed until combat has begun...then if your team is getting kicked, heal heal heal then drop into bear once the other team targets you.<br />
<br />
4. Bash the biggest damage dealer if they hone in on you and get your team to take them out.<br />

I say good, we have the max amount of people on each team and rotate everyone through.   If we took our best five, we'd be great, but we;re interested in getting everyone some gear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here's what I've discovered of the druid role.  Cyclone is the $h!t.  And it's bananas!   For real though, cyclone has several purposes.  It's a great spell interrupt.  With the gloves, it's faster than most heals.  Want to stop the heal that pally is about to cast on the class you're killin?  Feral charge isn't always up.  neither is bash.  You don't have time to lay combo points and maim.  But you can cyclone his butt.  Even if he trinkets out, he loses that time.<br />
<br />
I found that druids can effectively silence pallies and priests.  Because they lack an instant heal, you can engage a pally or priest like this:  Pounce, (add a combo point), maim, cyclone, (bear + enrage), Feral Charge (wait for school to become castable again), Bash, Cyclone.<br />
<br />
Every time, you should wait for them to begin casting again.  Watch a priests hands, cause they might start throwing hots or Prayer of Mending.  If they do, just continue with the stun pattern.  You don't want them HoTing the whole team.  This strategy is best on paladins.  Often, they don't bubble because druid stuns aren't long.  They think they'll be back in the action in one, two, or three seconds.<br />
<br />
As a druid in an arena, I feel like i have three jobs.  I run most successfully in my 3v3 with a rogue and a warrior.  My three jobs are to apply mangle, cyclone, heal.  Truth be told, in the 3v3, with the sap usually going down, I find myself just cycloning a healer while we burn down the third.<br />
<br />
And for those of you in 2v2, don't you hate paladins?  That bubble comes up and what can you do but watch the other guy in the arena get healed?!?  Simple.  The power of cyclone comes through once again.  Cyclone that other player, even if he's almost dead.  Keep him cycloned as long as possible so the pallies bubble will wear down and he can be controlled again.  Heals don't go through bubbles.<br />
<br />
I've won a couple 2v1 battles against pallies and another class that was almost dead using that strategy.  Time a cyclone on the pally to hit just after his bubble drops and then get into cat form and kill that other player.  Usually the pally will afk out of the arena, knowing that they can't kill you and its only a matter of time (a long time) before  they die.  I imagine cyclone control is even easier for resto and balance druids, but  the resto flava might have some trouble killing the other guy =]<br />
<br />
That's my current tip on arenas!</div></div><hr />

Hah, that's an awesome tip, never thought of that. All I run in is a 2v2 and we always struggle when going against a team with a pally. I'm gonna put this new strategy to work :)</div></div><hr />

The first piece you should go for is the one that is the biggest upgrade for you, in a slot you are least likely to see an upgrade in. I'll be getting tier 4 shoulders probably the next time they drop for my guild, so I'm not going to waste points on the arena shoulders (which are excellent btw). I won;t be seeing tier 4 chest anytime soon though, so I am getting the BP. Use the same logic for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now I could use new shoulders/chest/bracers/gloves/pants/hat since they are all the &quot;pre-kara clefthoof&quot; set.<br />
<br />
Stylin Purple Hat<br />
Assassin Shoulderpads<br />
Clefthoof Vest<br />
Umberhowl's<br />
Verdant Gloves<br />
Clefthoof Leggings<br />
<br />
I'm thinking I should replace my headpiece asap but I'm not sure which Gladiator's to take.<br />
<br />
Dragonhide has the most armor....but how important is Agility compared to Armor/Strength?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-13-2007, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are looking to upgrade a primary tanking piece, and still use it for dps, agility is much better than strength. Gives you dodge and crits for bear, and gives similar dps returns as strength would. <br />
<br />
Since you said pre-Kara, I assume you won't be seeing T4 anytime soon. In that case, the shoulders would be an excellent first piece. Great tanking and dps, and not likely to be upgraded for a long time. You're more likely to get T4 gloves and hat from Kara before shoulders and legs from Gruul's Lair, so again shoulders are a good choice for your first arena piece. I'd do shoulders before helm if I were you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get that you have to play 10 weeks in a 5v5 that stays around the 1500 rating. Or 12 weeks in a 3v3, 14 weeks in a 2v2. That duration gets much shorter if you have a better rating. A 5v5 that wins enough games to get a 1600-1700 rating should enable you to get that mace in 5-7 weeks.<br />

I have a question for the person who posted the 27/0/34 build.  I modified it slightly to remove all pve applications, but in general i am testing the same build.  Can you run me through a typical melee encounter and how you might react?  I'm having a tough time with warriors in particular, although i'm still fighting feral instincts to rest in bear form  and soak for a bit.  This is clearly not an effective strategy.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I didn't do much Arena with the 27/0/34 build but in general PvP when dealing with melee types I'd use nature's grasp to get an initial root, get some distance while dot'ing, then re-root and nuke. Of course, this only works against one foe at a time.</div></div><hr />

Just checking the viability of the spec.  I was finding a lot of downtime as feral that was trying to apply effective CC and sprinkle heals.  On the whole, I think it has potential, although I haven't reached my gear minimum yet, so I'm really just a wet sock.</div></div><hr />
