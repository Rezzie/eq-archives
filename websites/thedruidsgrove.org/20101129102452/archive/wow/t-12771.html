<br />
It does not, I'm afraid.  Instead, druids get a trinket (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32481) as a reward from one of the final quests (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10992) in the Swift Flight Form quest chain.<br />
To start the quest chain you need 5000g to purchase your swift flying mount skill from the trainer NPC in Shadowmoon Valley.<br />
<br />
Once you have that, you can begin the questline by speaking to Loganaar (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=12042), our dear trainer in Moonglade, who first taught us the way of the drood.  :&gt;<br />

<br />
Don't worry though druid.  With our help, making money can become easy :&gt;  It seems like an impossible figure now, but really it's just a number.  Once you have Swift Flight Form and you are zipping about shattrath like a feathered bullet, it will all seem worthwhile.<br />

<br />
http://files.filefront.com/epic+flightform+questlinemov/;7386446;/fileinfo.html<br />
<br />
i watched that video for weeks while i was trying to the gold for epic riding skill together... i took notes on all the quests (except for the raven god fight, which i really should have) and had everthing except for the final quest done the first night i had the riding skill... getting the gold together for epic riding skill can be an intimidating task, but with all the dailies you can do, and with using your proffessions, you'll have the gold more quickly than you think. With the dailies alone, it's a lot easier now than it was when i did it... <br />
<br />
BTW, the riding crop is a good item to have, too... it speeds up your mount for those times you're inconveniently in Azeroth or the Eastern Kingdoms...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The absolute bomb is to have the reward from the race quest chain on Netherwing Ledge (too lazy to look up the name and link it). While it doesn't stack with the trinket Annik describes, I use an item set on ItemRack to equip both when I'm travelling so I can move my fastest no matter where I am, Outlands or Azeroth. It's a quick click to go back and forth, and it really is a noticeable increase in speed.<br />
<br />
Riding crop does the same thing, but that particular quest line is really fun (should be a daily where you have to pick one level on a given day and can't change your mind- go for hard but rewarding or quick but cheap?) and rewards a fair bit of gold and rep in addition to the trinket.</div></div><hr />

It is now just useless due to the nerf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">11-06-2008, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, i've bitched about that in several other posts, and im sure my guild has gotten tired of me bitching about it... i now find myself mounting up and equipping the riding crop when i want to travel quickly...<br />
<br />
we no longer pop out of forms automatically when we're crafting, or using things that we can't use in forms... im wondering what the point of that little change is, too... granted it's not a big deal, i just have to keep remembering to make a click before i use the goggles in Nagrand, or before i start to craft anything... minor annoyance for the price of being able to use pots in forms (which saved my furry butt last night when we were 4-manning ZG with a ret pally healing me)</div></div><hr />

zomg that is now such an annoying change and i dont understand why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">11-07-2008, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but we can use almost all daily-items in forms^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-07-2008, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'almost' is the key word there...</div></div><hr />

What I find odd is that we use to automatically switch to caster form when we started casting.  It still happens when you cast a spell (I cast thorns and MotW on myself all the time in the air), but not when you &quot;cast&quot; the goggles.  Not sure why...<br />
<br />
Maybe the goggles are channeling and not casting???  Does casting tranquility or hurricane pop us out of flight form?<br />
<br />
For now, I just shift to cat as my landing move, as you can cast/channel/use in cat form.</div></div><hr />

So I assume the same mechanics would apply to flishgt form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but I&quot;m convinced the charm nerf was just a way to kick us while we were down.  I mean how did that really give us an advantage over anyone else? We have to do a quest chain for the form, are they going to nerf crusador aura for their speed bonus to their quest given mount?  NOPE</div></div><hr />

Accept it and move on.  Even I'll admit that the shear amount of abilities we can perform even without talents is staggering.  Talented properly a druid can fill so many roles that other people can't even dream of.</div></div><hr />
