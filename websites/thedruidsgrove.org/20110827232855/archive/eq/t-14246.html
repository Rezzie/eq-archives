As can be seen from my profile I have a ragtag mix of gear gleaned from the bazaar and old quests. I was wondering what might be good gear to work on solo if there is any? <br />
I do have a decent family sized guild so should be able to get my 1.5 but other than that I am not sure what to do next as far as gear.<br />
 <br />
As far as leveling and AA go, I think ultimately it is in my best interest to get to 70 (75) and then worry about AA. As far behind the curve as I am gearwise I think it behooves me to just level and be able to get into the harder zones and acquire gear casually. The thing that does kind of worry me is being so far behind on the spell curve but hopefully the new expansion will fix that.</div></div><hr />

You should consider getting GM gear, or if you can't afford it, masters gear would probably upgrade most slots.<br />
POR has some great quests for casual players. You could get a 200hp/190mana earring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39706), a 195hp, 200mana ring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39708), a 250hp/mana cloak (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=85614), and a 55hp/mana augment  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39710)from simple quests.<br />
DOD spell missions should sort out the rest of the slots, or the bazaar!<br />
ebit: doh - didnt think about the required lvl 68 on these or that you can't solo them. you could do them all with a small group though.<br />

For a casual player, the easiest is GM (master if GM is too expensive) culture armor for body parts, POR/DODH quests for ear/finger/charm aug, then fill the rest slots and the augs with DON crystal bought things. (some require level 70).<br />
 <br />
However since the next expansion is due next month, there may have some upgrades. I suggest postpone spending large quantity of money at this moment.</div></div><hr />
