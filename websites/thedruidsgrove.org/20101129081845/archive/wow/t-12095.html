<br />
Im level 55 now and getting ready to hit the outlands in a week or so.  What i want to do is to get some kind of system in place to maximize my rep while leveling to 70.  Im not too worried about gear until i hit 70.  But what i dont want to do is have to endlessly repeat instances to get my rep up because i didn't do something, or i did it wrong.<br />
<br />
So my questions are:<br />
<br />
Am i right in thinking that i should do the instances first until i cant get more rep from them, then do the quests?<br />
<br />
What order should i do the lands in? and at what level should i go to each land. <br />
<br />
If a quest is green or (gasp) gray do i still get the same amount of rep for doing it?<br />
<br />
What I think would work the best is to run an instance get all the rep i can from it, then only do the quests in the area that give me exp for that faction.  Then move on to the next area.   <br />
<br />
Thanks for you time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do instance runs until they no longer give any rep (be sure to get the quests associated with running the instances, just don't turn them in).<br />
<br />
Do quests.</div></div><hr />

Check out both factions and the corresponding user comments on Wowhead to get the &quot;best&quot; approach.  The above post covers 90% of the scenarios.  Basically quest always give rep regardless of current level.  So, do those last.<br />
<br />
Also, in 2.3, you only have to be honored to get your heroic key, which means lower city rep management isn't as much of an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cenarion Expedition - I turned in plant parts until I couldn't get anymore rep ( honored I think? ) then did quests and ran maybe 3 instances and hit revered somewhere in there.<br />
<br />
Lower City - not many quests....Just bite your lip and run Shadow Lab to revered.<br />
<br />
Sha'tar - similar to lower city - run instances for rep ( this was the slowest for me )<br />
<br />
Gray quests still give you the same amount of rep.<br />
<br />
Order of progression in terms of leveling<br />
Hellfire -&gt; Zangramarsh -&gt; Terrokar Forrest -&gt; Nagrand -&gt; Blade's Edge -&gt; Shadowmoon Valley / Netherstorm</div></div><hr />

I didn't run Ramparts or Bloodfurnace till I almost had all the quests done. Also, I went to Terokkar first. All the quests there were pretty eays. Guess I hit Zangarmarsh next. Faction is gonna be a biatch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darth603</div><div class="date">10-24-2007, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, running Ramparts or Auchenai Crypts until 5999 Honored is a dream. I doubt any guild will ever do that for someone, and the the LFG is too full of DPS classes to be of much use. Which is unfortunate, because it means you have to run Shadow Labs and Shattered Halls until your eyes bleed.<br />
<br />
Which is also why Blizz is going to be changing Heroic keys to only require Honored rep in 2.3.</div></div><hr />

I read through the whole thing. It's not really hard to think this out but it's nice to have something organized you can follow.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />

Im glad that i get rep even for the grey quests so that i dont have to worry about getting all the quests done before they hit grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uttercup</div><div class="date">10-24-2007, 11:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trixtaa /hug /love.   I posted the last one before you had posted your reply.   This helps tons.<br />
<br />
Here is another question.  There is a rogue site <br />
http://shadowpanther.net  that was my bible for gear as a rogue.  is there something like this for Druids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">10-25-2007, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't realize they lowered heroic keys to Honored! The guide should still work though, nothing wrong with a little more rep ;D<br />
<br />
You could always try The Druid Wiki (http://druid.wikispaces.com/) and check out the gear section on the left navigation bar.<br />
<br />
Not sure what spec you are Emmerald's Feral Gear list (contains Bear Tanking/Bear High-End Tanking/Kitty Burst/Kitty Sustained DPS) all in a nice spreadsheet. Not so much help for leveling but at 70 it was really useful.<br />

<br />
If you're going for your Heroic Keys, just do things as you normally would.<br />
<br />
They dropped the requirement for Heroics to Honored in 2.3.</div></div><hr />

If you're playing daily, there's no reason not to work on the rep now, especially since a lot of the nice profession rep items are for revered and or exalted.  You'll want most of the rep eventually.</div></div><hr />
