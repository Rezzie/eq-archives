This is really my first experience with true PVP.  I played EQ for 4 years but on a blue server.  Also My main toon was a Paladin (lvl 70)<br />
<br />
So anyway I am constantly getting my butt handed to me by the Horde.  Usually its a Rogue in stealth but the other night my RL wife (who is a lvl 19 Druid) and I were attacked from behind by a 26 Orc Shaman.  He attacked her first and killed her outwrite.  Once I realized we were being attacked I turned on him.  I was already in cat form as we were out killing spiders in Wetlands.  The fight with him was over in a few seconds.  I was able to get him to about half health maybe almost a third before I switched out to try to heal myself or go to bear or do SOMETHING.  Anyway I was dead before I could do anything productive.  <br />
<br />
Now gear wise he looked pretty decked out.  I am just going on the graphics of course but he looked like he had his slots filled.  I could be wrong here though.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to start thinking like a PVP Druid?  basically every interaction with the Horde so far as resulted in me being dead.<br />

The same goes for rogues if they get the jump on you.<br />
<br />
 Now as far as learning how to be effective in pvp its just gonna take more timeand more talents. Ill try and give you some basic guidelines.<br />
<br />
 Cat form is good for openers if you get the jump on someone however its not good for sustained  toe to toe fighting unless you are a higher level or your initial attack puts a huge dent in their HP's.<br />
 The most effective pvp druids use all of their forms in a fight and with time you will learn when to shift back and forth. Each class that you will face will take differnt tactics so you can play on your strengths and their weaknesses.<br />
<br />
 One of my standard techniques is to start in cat. Try and rip a big hole in them and get some combo points, shift to caster moonfire once, Fairy fire (if you havent already with feral FF) then go bear or back to cat depending on how the fight is going. This is a very basic example because with a druid things can be done very differently depending on your style or the class you are fighting.<br />
<br />
 I guess to sum it up just give yourself more time to get better talents, improve your skills, and develope your own style. Druids take alot of skill to master (IMO), but they do kick ass.<br />
 If you have anymore questions please dont hesitate to ask. I, along with others here, will help you out as much as possible.<br />

<br />
I have been leaning more toward strength and agility gear so far (although at my level getting any gear is sometimes a challenge) and basically been guessing at which talents to pick.  I have put the majority into Feral with a couple into Restoration (Furror).<br />
<br />
I have a 1 handed mace that has +8 to attack and some kind of stick thing for my off hand that is +2 to spirit and +2 to something else.  Cant remember what. lol.. <br />
<br />
When fighting mobs up to about lvl 25 I can basically shred them in cat form before I need a heal.  My wife likes to be a castor and rarely uses the bear form.  Shes lvl 19 atm.<br />
<br />
If I am soloing I pull with Wrath, moonfire, Fairy fire, sometimes a starfire then usually Cat form.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I am usually holding my sleeping 7 month old baby in one arm and have to use the mouse to do most of the actions. lol..  If I had 2 hands to use the keyboard too I would do better I am sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-11-2006, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats fairly impressive that you got a shammy 5 lvls above you to half health.  They are probably the hardest class, aside from locks and shadow priests, in the game to beat imo.<br />
<br />
A great talent that will help you shift out to heal, and have a relativley uninterrupted heal is Natures Focus.  I would strongly recomment this talent for pvp and pve, as if you are fighting a mob / horde, you can jump out, cast a renew rejuv on yourself, then go into bear to take the beating that is waiting for you.  Without this talent, it is really hard to get a heal off if you have more than one mob on you with a decent attack speed.  Just my personal experience.  I have played both with and without, and everything is harder and more stressful without it (you have to pop out to heal sooner, as your heal will be interrupted a lot)<br />
<br />
As far as PvP for Feral if you can get the jump on the person, go in cat form b/c stealthed you can open with either a stun (and combo point) or ravage (big dmg and combo point).  I like to open with stun, b/c in the 3 sec they are stunned, I can get off a rake, ff and shred, giving me 3 combo points.  I will usually then shred again, rake again (keep the dot active) and then rip using all 5 combo points.  This will give you big dot while you shift out.  Once you shift out, you have a couple options.  Root, Heal MF then back to cat, or switch out, MF Regrowth and to bear to let your dot's and hot's tick away so that when the mob is dead you are at or close to full health.  One other piece of advice: At lv 30, pick up the green whelp armor.  It gives you a 5% chance when hit to put the target to sleep for 30 sec :) <br />
<br />
Dont forget about rooting and hibernating things.  Crowd Control goes a long way.  You are doing great.  Esp with the 7mo in one arm :)</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they can't purge Frenzied Regen though.<br />
<br />
I guess that's something to remember when you're fighting a Shammy.<br />

I should have my leathercrafting high enough by then to make it.  I'm at 116 right now.  It requires 175 I believe.<br />
<br />
Maybe then I can kill a rogue lol..  /spit on them.  Just kidding to all the Rogues.<br />
<br />
I need to get my feral talents up a bit and offer some payback.  <br />
<br />
Last night in..   oh..  not Auberdine but the city south of it...  Begins with an A also.  <br />
<br />
Anyway in the city a dang 60 Rogue cleared out the guards (lvl 40s) and proceded to kill everyone passing through the town.  Me included lol..  When other 60s showed up he would stealth and wait them out until they left.  Then would pick up where he left off.  <br />
<br />
ah well..  thats why its called PvP.<br />
<br />
Someday.....<br />

Almost makes me want to do that to young horde when I hit 60, but I have more class than that.<br />
<br />
Thats what we call a bored, ganking bastard little kid.  And the main reason I hate rogues.  Don't know if it is because there are more of them (there are more UD rogues and shamans on my server than all of alliance), or if it is just the mentality of they type of people that play rogues, but they tend by and large to be bastards.  <br />
<br />
There is no point in ganking lv 20-30 while they are trying to lvl in a contested area.  SO QUIT IT ROGUES.  Sorry, struck a nerve there lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">01-11-2006, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'd suggest is going to Filefront.com and downloading some druid PvP video's.  Without question the best produceded/edited one I've seen in Ferhargo's &lt;sp?&gt; &quot;Never&quot; video... but that is all pre-1.8 and feature's the classic druid outlast tatic.  It's still mainly how I fight as a primarily resto-druid, but I think you'll pick up some hints.<br />
<br />
Oh, and maybe one of those baby strap things that let you hold your baby without your hands 8)</div></div><hr />
