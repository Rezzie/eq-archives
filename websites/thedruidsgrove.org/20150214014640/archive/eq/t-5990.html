I just had to bitch about that cause more then likely sony wont give it to me grrr. I now qualify this as WORST PATCH EVER! ( yesterday was an over all bad day anyways lol). After working a 12hr shift (working for TRU) Losing a few 100% store sales because of dumbass Seasonal people then got a 2.5k sale back out, was not a good work. Get home, OTM Ssra, Com1 &amp; 2 up, get bounced between groups like a ping pong ball in Forest Gump, Get back to the raid, raid drops EVERYONE goes LD, no one can log back in (ive been up since 5:30am est) It's close to midnight for me, I cant log back in, try for about 30mins still cant get in, go to chat and find a friend from guild, talk a few, we both log. FIX THE FOCKING SERVERS!  :evilgrin: <br />
