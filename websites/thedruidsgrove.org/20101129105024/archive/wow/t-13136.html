Ok, I am trying to think of the maximum way to heal this.  I think the max ways is to maintain 3x LB on 2 people, depend on LB bloom on 2 people and hit WG 3x when necrotic run is down.<br />
<br />
Here's a spreadsheet I did trying to figure out the timing.  I'm not sure how long my LB lasts, gotta figure that out yet.  It is either 9 or 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pBE9T9gcHlKYZfPLVaxCHNA<br />
<br />
I'm figuring 2500 Bloom and 2400 for 3 WB hits (1st second ticks).  Also I am getting about 1100 for LB ticks right now.<br />
<br />
Oh, just found an error.... 2nd and 3rd person on bloom will get some ticks of 1xLB... fixed.<br />
<br />
I just don't know if a strategy like this is too micro-managed to really do any good though.</div></div><hr />

Your DPS all have to make sure to get the crit buff so he dies before the group is taking TOO much damage.<br />
<br />
Our druids pop rejuvs on everyone so they get a few ticks before the aura comes back up.  I think they hit a few WGs too.  As a shaman I get off 2 chainheals and a riptide, our priests hit a few prayer of healing or circle of healing and pallys have a bacon up and hit a few heals.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">01-04-2009, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I healed him I just timed an LB to bloom during the healing period, dropped a Rejuve for some extra ticks, and dropped an HT bomb.  Had no trouble keeping the tank (that was well-geared) up.  I also make the dps self heal to take some of the strain off the healers so they can focus on the tank and on themselves.<br />
<br />
I usually tank and if the healers are struggling with the timing I'll drop a pot or Frenzied Regen to help out.  The main thing is for the raid to make it as easy as possible on the healers.  If your raid isn't helping you tell them to man up, turn off their damn meters, and measure success by how smoothly the boss goes down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">01-04-2009, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Rejuv ticks once every 3 seconds so that seemed a bit weak to me.   Granted, having it running is another 1100 health but that isn't enough later on in the fight.  <br />
<br />
We're kind of new to Loatheb (25-version) so it's a bit rough for us still.</div></div><hr />

It is absolutely non sensical for four healers to spam their biggest heal on the tank because at least two of you will be over healing. This might already be the case.

Yeah, we do the same thing.  Good point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-06-2009, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another fun strat, is to break your groups up in raid.  If you are anything like our guild...we have an overabundance of druids atm, so its rare that we enter Naxx-10 with less than 3 druids.<br />
<br />
1 Resto, 1 Boomkin, 1 Bear (OT, so kitty for this encounter)<br />
<br />
If the Boomkin and the Kitty just Tranq about half way through the encounter together, and they are in different groups, the enitre raid get healed to full, and healers get a whole round off.  This seems to really help mana pools etc.  Also, 3 x druid with innervate glyph....lots and lots of mana.<br />
<br />
And yes, if you are raiding without DBM or BigWigs...you need to rethink your raiding habits!  These have become standard raiding reqs like Omen and Vent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried my strategy I posted and found it was WAY too fiddly.  I kind of thought it might be.  What seemed to work best was to get everyone Rejuv'd and spam WG a couple times (since it's heal is front loaded).  I managed to do the most healing on the raid, so I must be doing something right.  <br />
<br />
We had issues with our DPSers, as we seem to do often.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
I didn't even think of Tranquility until kind of late.<br />
<br />
Deadly Boss mods is definitely necessary.</div></div><hr />

Had a similar issue in a Naxx 25 last night, i was actually Boomy on this run. We only had about 3-4 of us over 3K, Hunter and I over 4k. Everyone else was below 2k (trash being what it is in terms of AOE this is understandable) but even our Boss Dps was low. Alot of the melee seemed to simply neglect +hit rating, which i don't fully understand. That's the problem with making the leveling process so easy and then including stats that half the player base obviously doesn't understand. (of course it could've just been &quot;one of those nights&quot;) We finished Arachnid Quarter at least though.</div></div><hr />

This seems to be a global issue!  I think in TBC even the non-theorycrafters were informed on their class and rotations.  Also, so many of our DPSers simply out geared the content we were raiding, thanks to OP badge gear.  <br />
<br />
Now, so many are new to 80, and they see 1500 DPS and think its somthing to be proud of.  Badge gear is on par with the content we are raiding, so poor players, with badge gear, simply won't cut it anymore.  So many people are struggling to understand the importance of stats!  Many of our casters were passing on Naxx-10 drops when they had T5/6 gear still equipped and socketed with Northrend gems.  The result maybe +20 more spellpower on the T5, but they fail to notice that they are losing 25 stam and 40 int...etc!  <br />
<br />
Our guild is struggling to make the push to 25 mans atm.  We have 10-12 strong players that can easily clear to Saph.  However, the other 13-15 players for our 25-man are still struggling to understand their class, and the newer complex raiding environment.  <br />
<br />
I have seen recount charts from full Naxx clears where no one was +2800 DPS.  I have also seen epic fails in Naxx with DPSers +4k.  Its really a matter of educated raiders right now with the content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">01-13-2009, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, a lot depends on being able to follow directions and coordinate with everyone else.  Plus, raid leaders need to be able to verbalize appropriately what has to be done.  We've had some epic misunderstandings due to how RL's expressed themselves.  <br />
<br />
I remember on my first OS run, I was told to stay behind on the first portal.  I thought that meant, the first portal, exactly as said.  Not the portals (plural) of the first drake.</div></div><hr />
