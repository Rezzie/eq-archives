<br />
First, a player in the game mention &quot;quad kiting&quot;, now I get the concept, snare four critters then hit them with a lightning spell (??) or something.  Can anyone fill me in on the procedure for quad kiting?  I am now level 29.<br />
<br />
Also, at level 30 I get to &quot;specialize&quot; in one of my magic skills.  I have been using my Dot spells a lot because I have been soloing a lot.  Should I specialize in Conjuration?  Or would I be better off specializing in something else?  Keep in mind that I do like to solo a lot.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help, and thanks again for the help in the other thread....much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

This may have changed with the spell level alterations a few months back.  I would recommand doign a search for it and seeing what you come up with.<br />
<br />
Secondly, If you plan to continue soloing, the Spec you choose would either be Conjuration or Evocation.<br />
<br />
If you Root and DoT a mob, choose the former, if you like to nuke things to death - pick the later.<br />
<br />
If you ever plan to become a grouping druid, pick alteration.<br />
<br />
You can change your spec with a quest from Sol Ro Temple Later, but getting your speced skill back to 200 will suck.<br />

Do you remember what spell you first used to quad kite?  It must be an area effect spell right?  The person I talked to in-game could only tell me that they thought it was a lightning effect of some sort.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice on my specialize.  I think I am going to go with conjuration.</div></div><hr />

The spell had its level lowered to 31.  It is known as Lightning Strike:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">01-16-2006, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quad kiting gets to be more important for druids in later levels, it can really make exp fly at times.  Quad kiting in cobalt scar is one of the old standbys.  Its a great tool, but it is limited because it depends on an outdoor zone with plenty of room and a good supply of snarable mobs...plus good zone pathing, heh.<br />
<br />
Whenever you want to check an area for quadding, start with just two mobs.  See how it goes, their hp vs mana output, their pathing etc.  Test things a bit to see if you can manage the area, then go to town.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">01-16-2006, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you wanna start quad kiting, I suggest Iceclad. Try doing the snow cougars. Just pull em with snare and kite em until you have 4. After that simply kite around until they are all lined up in a tidy bunch.<br />
<br />
It's important to read what sliggoth said first though, you need to find out if your mana is enough for a full kite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">01-17-2006, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I would suggest Evocation as your specialization if you solo mostly. Most of the DoT spells you will use later also use Evocation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eiram</div><div class="date">01-17-2006, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At later levels you can also use our coldbased Rainspells to quadkite in Iceclad and Cobaldscar the Mobs are highresistant to Cold but in Hall of Honnors and if you get luckily flaged for Plane of Fire the Rainspells are much better for quadding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodie</div><div class="date">01-17-2006, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well thanks for all the help everyone.  If the higher level dot spells are run by evocation then I had better specialize in it.  My understanding is that all the specialize skills will climb as high as 50, the one that goes to 51 first is the only one that will continue to climb.  I should have saved some of my skill points so I could give evocation a 20 point head start eh?<br />
<br />
Anyways...gonna head back to Norath.  Someone should have told me that this game gets real addictive fast.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-17-2006, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to be confusing..<br />
<br />
2 of the DoT lines are Evoc, the highly unresistable one is Conjur.<br />
<br />
Since you don't gain the 3rd dot line till 55, Conjuration is the way to go till that time if you root rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">01-18-2006, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly suggest alteration. It's not the dot spells but ensnare and root that matters. If you can pull out a quicker root when the mob is beating on you, you survive. Safety first :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatankawd</div><div class="date">01-18-2006, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Huh?  Specialization helps with saving mana on cast, not in cutting the cast time.  Speccing in alteration to help with roots and snares makes no sense at all. It does help with healing, but that's a separate issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dari</div><div class="date">01-25-2006, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my favorite quadding spots was EW. Take the IC port, head to EW and hang a right just off the bridge. Go past the coldain huts and you'll see a spot with ulthorks, rhinos and walrus. The ulthork hunters are great to start with. Plenty of room to kite and they don't have a lot of hp. As you level, you can move up to walrus, rhinos and ulthork warriors. There are plenty of mobs here to keep you busy-just watch for walrus adds that come up from the water's edge. I alway keep 3rd person view for kiting so I can see exactly where my kite group is, and where possible adds are.<br />
<br />
Start with 2 mobs. Work your way up to 3 as you gain experience. The cougars in IC are also much fun and easy to kite. Once you've had your fill in IC and EW, you should be experienced enough and high enough to head to CS and take on the wyverns-just watch out for the named ones-they give CoV faction hits and don't snare!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodie</div><div class="date">01-27-2006, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...I hunted the uthorks in EW, got 16 tusks that I cashed in in Cobalt Scar.  Made 800 plat...woot.<br />
<br />
Still haven't grouped up yet...lol.  Contimplating joining a guild but want to find one that is still doing some LDoN adventures.  <br />
<br />
I'm level 42 now.  Any suggestions for soloing at that level?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the advice.<br />

Oh...and I went with Conjuration as my specialty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kodie</div><div class="date">01-27-2006, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more question.  About the Druid Epic.  Is that first one the Epic 1.5 mentioned in another thread?  Can I start it soon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madie of Wind Riders</div><div class="date">01-27-2006, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first druid epic is the druid 1.0 or Naturewalkers Schimitar. You can start some of the preliminary things like the foraging required and running errands. In general, the &quot;fights&quot; required are all 1 groupable now, some are even duo-able.<br />
 <br />
There is a quest you can do if you wish to skip that part and start on your epic 1.5. However, I would suggest at your level to get the 1.0 first then after 60 to start your 1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-27-2006, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 1.0 Can be completed at 46, but does not work till Level 50 (You can't click it).<br />
<br />
The 1.5 Can be started at level 60 (I think), but can not be completed equiped till level 65.<br />
<br />
The 2.0 Requires having done the 1.5, and can be started directly afterward, but can not be equiped till level 70.<br />

<br />
I have a question about this - &quot;duoable&quot;.  Are we talking uber-geared top-tier toons, or your average level 65-68 casual players.  I really can't see 2-3 casual level 67s taking out Faydedar.  Who knows though, I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm mainly asking because the OP seems unlikely to be hanging with top-tier toons, being relatively new and all.  It would be nice if people would qualify these statements sometimes, so people don't go blowing an epic fight opportunity by bringing vastly underpowered forces.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

A watched a 65 BST solo Faydedar. Was a guildie at the time in a guild that wasn't even in PoP, never finished Ssra, etc. So I'm sure by the time you are 65 these days it should be quite easy with the gear that is avail to non uber guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madie of Wind Riders</div><div class="date">01-30-2006, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a friend that 2 boxes a warrior and cleric - both level 70 but no where near time geared. They are the ones I mostly hunt with - so lately we have gotten a bit better gear - but I watched him duo faydeder several times over a year ago.<br />
 <br />
Faydeder was one of the old world dragon types that has the fear roar and AE fire breath. But after you are level 65 you resist that alot. As well as having the Cleric run his HoT - it was very slick actually :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-30-2006, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faydedar hits a max of 325, has 32kish Hitpoints, a AE Fear which is -150 MR Check and a AE Fire Dispell for 500 Damage which is FR -150 Check.<br />
<br />
Since he is a Kunark Era Mob, he only doubles and frankly, a Valor Razorfiend would be harder to kill then he is.<br />
