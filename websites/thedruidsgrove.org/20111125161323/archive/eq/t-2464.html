<br />
I'm looking for some advise on soloing the bank area in Kael for some armor upgrades.  I'm lvl 58 with epic and 255 wis, but only 2k hp self buffed, so i'm not too sure if this is really feasible at my current state.  I've scouted out the area and there doesn't seem to be any really good place to pull to, and it looks like i'll get at least 2 mobs per pull.  Another thing that i'm unclear on is what mobs in the area drop the armor?  I assume it's the seargents, but what about the watchmen?<br />
<br />
Any input on pulling techniques and other info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

None of the Stormgiant Watchers/Sargants/Leuitenants summon. But they do have a good few hps. And watch out for wanderers.<br />
<br />
A few more levels, and arena is doable w/ wolves from the pit.</div></div><hr />

Puppies make decent disposable pets if you get bored, root is rarely resisted, and they don't hit all that hard if it does break.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing you need to seriously worry about in the bank area/tunnels just below Arena..  is Captain Bvellos.. he's quite nasty. :(</div></div><hr />

I heard about this the other day so I figure I would go down there and try it out.  I pull the wolves snare one in that safe hall egress and it is waiting there for me when I get back.  I charm it and start pulling giants.  The wolf tears through the giants, so things are looking good then charm break.  My wolf proceeds to summon and beat the bejesus out of me.  Do some of the wolves not summon or is there a tactic for dealing with it?  Appreciate any info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always end up on the bad end of that deal.  I hear folks can get it down though, not sure if it is &quot;technique&quot; as much as it is a little luck, great AC and HP.<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
Forgot to add, if your doing the arena, there is a possibility you'll get a summoning giant as well.  Nothing like having charm break, get summoned, have gaint summon, although druid Pong I guess could be fun :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually go with maximizing wolf dps to minimize wolf hurt, most of the stuff at the bank can't hurt a dual wielding, hasted wolf enough that the wolf summons if charm breaks (Bvellos, Drioc and Helssen are exceptions).  The wolves have hefty regen, and won't summon unless below 97% health.<br />
<br />
At the bank only Lieutenants can drop armor.  However if you're at the bank and have the cajones you can pull the stuff up the ramp to tormax (adjutants/veterans/etc) all of that stuff summons though, so you have to be careful (and the first pull will get 2 giants).<br />
<br />
I've parsed my wolves at over 300 dps on the bank trash at times.<br />
<br />
I do die a lot though.</div></div><hr />

As soon as it drops below 97% heal him<br />
After the fight invis snare glamour charm then pull next<br />
If you wait 30 seconds or so you will know if charm will hold for the 4 minutes or so to kill a giant because it seems to break either real fast or real slow.  also you have to try a few times to charm since some are too high unless you have command.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ecchu</div><div class="date">01-12-2003, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Believe it or not kael is the best exp hands down for a level 60 druid.  I farmed / exped there constantly with minimal risk until PoP came out... which in effect killed all my velious exping... but anyway there isn't much to it.  Charm a wolf and keep it under control... SotW is very nice for something such as this.  The max any wolf will hit that is charmable with Call of Karana is 233... not too much but if it is hasted it could mean trouble.  Charm breaking, while it may seem like death, really isn't.  If you want to play it safe only do the bank area and up to the arena for some nice exp, or if you want to do exp I reccomend starting off with the Tmax ramp before going to arena.  It is much easier to do CR in bank area lol.  The wolves and giants only summon every 10 seconds.  That is more than enough time to run away and recharm... that is always first priority unless you at 1 bub of hp lol.  After that just root the giant and let your pet eat it.  If you want to just farm armor then I reccomend grouping with a similar level shaman and going to arena.  After shaman slow the pet regens faster than the damage given out by even Veterans.  Its just a matter of getting the hang of killing summoning mobs.  Most druids are afraid of such a thing, but in the end you will find yourself much richer for the experience.  Enjoy kael as I once did... for it looks like the whole secret to doing it was already released lol.  Try not to die and enjoy the exp.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah there used to be an awesome bug that no longer works.  /pet back off used to regen wolf to 100 percent hp.  This was very nice but got nerfed really fast.  I did 5 aa in around 6.5 hours doing that... which was very good at the time.<br />
<br />
Best of luck!</div></div><hr />

But the bank account usually goes whee.</div></div><hr />
