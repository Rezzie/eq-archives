<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kalest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok last patch message said they had lowered the failure rate on trivial items. Now today hasnt been a good day so maybe it was just bad luck but a friend said he had the same problem of failing to many times. I failed an entire stack of Kiola sap I was making. 7x's in row even once on another stack. /sigh. Anyways is anyone having the same problem? Or is it because of my sucky dex?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BriennaMonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think Dex gets taken into account on brewing.  Probably they changed the percentage of failure on trivials, but you're still dealing with the same Random Number Generator.<br />
<br />
I wish they would let people combine stacks on stuff that was way trivial.  I used to wreck my wrists making kiolas, and now I have mild Carpal Tunnel Syndrome that's affecting my work :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loralin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The change to the way trivial combines are handled was actually to reduce the rate of failures as you increase how far over trivial you are.<br />
<br />
For example my JC is skill maxed and over a few hundred combines of lacquered star rubies (trivial 128 )  the other day I only a failed 2 combines.  However at smithing 235 I failed the subcombines for the PoTC sickles (trivial 180) at a much higher rate.</div></div><hr />
