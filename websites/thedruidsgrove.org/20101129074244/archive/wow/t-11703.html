Small FAQ I'm working on. I'll update if I notice anything else to put here - or you can just tell me if you think somehing else should be here.<br />
<br />
Q: Where does the quest start?<br />
A: The quest starts from the druid trainer in Moonglade. NOTE: To start the quest you need to have purchased the 300 riding skill (5000g). The quest won't even show up if you do not have the skill.<br />
<br />
Q: Where do I find Bogblossoms?<br />
A: They are on top of the giant mushrooms in Zangarmarsh. You do not need to be an herbalist to gather these, however, while you are on the quest these can be tracked with Find Herbs. Since it is a test realm you can always drop something else for herbalism to make these easier to find.<br />
<br />
Q: Essence of the ____ is bugged - how do I summon?<br />
A: Stand on the edge of the base on either side and you should be able to summon it. It shouldn't take very long to get to the right spot.<br />
<br />
Q: Where do I get the Charm of Swift Flight?<br />
A: It's a quest reward for the Essence of the Hawk. (it's the last one of the 3 essence quests I have to double check the name)<br />
<br />
Q: Do I need a group for these quests?<br />
A: All of these quests should be soloable except for the last part.<br />
<br />
Q: What is the final part of the quest?<br />
A: You have to kill the new Raven God boss in Sethekk Halls on Heroic dificulty. Completion of this quest will Give you Swift Flight Form as well as Idol of the Raven Goddess.<br />
<br />

Ok, so I'll update this as I go through it. After moonglade you get sent to Zangarmarsh to talk to someone. He says bring him 10 ancient lichen, 10 dreaming glory and 15 bogblossoms. Bogblossoms grow on top of the mushrooms and you don't need herbalism to get them (track herbs tracks them though). One of them just blew up and sent me flying when I tried to harvest it. 3 min debuff that decreases str/int by 25. Then back to moonglade. Boring and easy escort quest in moonglade, back to Zangar and onto the new Blade's Edge area. Kill a ray and I think the item is a 100% drop rate - but use the item which allows you to see spirits there. The guy you need to find is near the ogre town. Go to nagrand next to capture a bird, kinda fun quick quest. On to Skettis - very very annoying quest where you have to call a bird to dig up stones for you. 40s CD on the item to call him and he finds 1 or none. After this you have 3 quests to kill guys and get essences. They are currently buggy and it's hard to summon the boss right now. They are all in Terrokar and it suggests doing the 1st in bear, 2nd in cat and 3rd use magic. Then back to Blade's Edge, Zangarmarsh, and Azshara for the next fun part. You have to go to an altar and some goblin shows up and steals the Moonstone you need. You have to hop into the river and catch up to her and she throws bombs and frost novas you. I'm guessing a travel form and maybe even healing quest is coming up.<br />
<br />
Return this quest to the guy in Zangarmarsh and you are on the last part.</div></div><hr />

While you don't get the birds helping you, you also don't have to fight his adds -- you just get a couple mid-fight breaks.  On balance, it makes the fight considerably easier.<br />
<br />
In 2.1.2, you won't be able to pull him out, but it seems they're reducing the adds somewhat.</div></div><hr />

I just finished the last step before going to Sethekk and, yes, it's interesting and somewhat entertaining, but mostly I found it tedious, requiring excessive amounts of travel time. At this stage I'm almost indifferent about flight form, I just want to spend some time doing SOMETHING other than traveling. Wish me luck in Sethekk.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to hear how you found heroic Sethekk... I'm still grinding Lower City rep, and raising gold by doin as many dailies and quests as i can when i log on, but im still only halfway there (rep-wise AND gold-wise)    &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sethekk Halls is not all that bad if you have a mage/rogue &amp; priest ( priest with fear ward is even better ).  Just be careful of the mobs that fear and the guards that pull in 2.  They hit hard and VERY fast and cannot be CC'd.  You just have to burn one down.<br />

I did the same thing, but last night I went through Sethekk with a PUG put together by a shadow priest named Alphasage. He was gunning for the staff that Ikiss drops, and accused me of planning to drop after we killed Anzu. As a gesture of good faith I bypassed Anzu and we went on to Ikiss. It was awful. Just awful. This ^%$#*&amp; Alphasage was bossy and tried to tell us all how to do our jobs (me- tank- included) and I almost quit, but I really wanted to get to Anzu so I hung in there. Finally we got Ikiss down, and Alphasage had &quot;an urgent phone call&quot; and hearthed out. The group fell apart from there so I'm still flyin' slow. I'll be going back tonight, this time with my guild, so at least the company will be better. I only tell you this to warn you never to group with Alphasage since you're on Malfurion too.<br />
<br />

I almost pst'ed you when the group fell apart, but you were in Kara. Maybe next time.<br />
<br />
BTW- will the altar where I summon Anzu still be there when I go back? If not, how do I spawn the altar again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah buddy! I REALLY appreciate your offer to help. My guild pulled together and we got it done. We have a couple casters who are gunning for the staff that drops off Ikiss. so they were willing to help out.<br />
<br />
I LOVED the fight against Anzu. WoWWiki's advice about creating macros to target the statues, cast Rejuv (rank 1) and target last target are dead on. It was a long but fun and easy fight.<br />
<br />
But most of all, epic flight form just rocks! That's all I can say, it just rocks! Can't wait to do my bombing runs at Mach 1.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ranchy</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for this good info... I also wanted to give some feedback from a bear tank's point of view.<br />
<br />
As a tank, I able to solo up to the Hawk's Essence and had a Healadin help for that.  I nuked while he healed and did some dps.  It took all our mana to drop him--but we weren't trying to be efficient.  :)<br />
<br />
For chasing the Moonstone: swim as deep as you can helps from getting blasted out of the water and dropping out of sea cow form.<br />
<br />
When you get to Heroic Sethekk Halls, the toughest fight will be the first boss in the instance, Darkweaver Syth.  Our party had 1 mage, 2 warlocks, 1 healadin and me to tank.  We wiped a few times.  :)<br />
<br />
We cleared to the room to summon Anzu and I tried tanking it (which meant no bonuses from the statues) and that was a big waste of time since we wiped very slowly, so the mage logged onto his warrior to tank it so I could try to HoT the statues.  :P  <br />
<br />
With me doing nothing but casting rank 1 rejuvination on the statues, the fight was easy peasy even with just two warlocks for dps--it was ample.  <br />
<br />
The moral of the story:  If you're a bear tank, have someone else tank, or bring a 2nd druid.  It's a fun fight.   <br />
<br />
The warrior got back on his mage and I tanked Ikiss for another easy Badge of Justice.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for collecting the info for this quest, it was a huge help.  If anyone on Argent Dawn needs help with this feel free to send a tell.<br />

Just got mine today.  And the above quote says it all.  There really are not enough words in the English language to fully describe Epic Flight form's full &quot;awesomeness&quot;.  <br />
<br />
For those who are on the fence about going for it, that's cool.  Not everyone actually wants it.  Not gonna lie, the quest chain is a royal pain in the butt.  However, once it's completed, you realize immediately that it was worth the time, the blood, the sweat and, depending on your Sett Halls run, the possible tears. ;)</div></div><hr />

everything else was pretty easy. <br />

<br />
I'm on the last part of the epic flight form quest and have never  been into Sethekk Halls on heroic level before.<br />
<br />
I levelled as resto druid on another server in a raiding guild, Im now on Stormrage server with real life friends and respecced to feral for fun. But I really want this epic flight form so i think would be best to respec to resto for it and hopefully find a good group to go with.<br />
<br />
Is there a minimum armour requirement for it? Do I have to have all purples? <br />
<br />
And is there anyone on Stormrage server who knows a group that will take me with them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">02-22-2008, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">u should definately have a druid-healer with u.<br />
because of the 3 statues that should be perma-HoTed.<br />
Makes the fight sooo much easier.<br />
<br />
I'm a healer and had no problem healing the group and keeping the statues up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-22-2008, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i finally got into Sethhek Halls for the first time in normal earlier in the week.<br />
<br />
now gotta find a good group with another druid it seems to do it heroic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrana</div><div class="date">02-23-2008, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got my swift flight form and it was a lot easier than I thought. I stayed as feral until Anzu then changed to caster form to keep spirits alive. Didnt need to respec to get a group after all.<br />
<br />
I must warn everyone though that this form is fast. There are 2 holes in the Shattrath bank walls where I flew into them. Pity I couldnt keep my scruffy little 60% speed crow for city flying!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">03-19-2008, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought the riding skill and have finished everything but the last step.  I will say that as a Feral Druid with a crappy healing/nuke kit, the &quot;The Hawk's Essence&quot; was stupid difficult.  I died twice in seconds and the mob had 90-95% health.  I brought in 2 friends (Pally and Mage).  Again, I died within seconds, but they barely managed to take him out.  Pally rez'd me, I looted.  I hope I never have to see him again.<br />
<br />
For the Heroic run, assuming I'm an &quot;off healer&quot; (I'll respec for ToL), how much +heal, mp5, int, spirit will I need?  Or will just about anything do as long as the rest of the group is uber?<br />
<br />
One more thing, on wowhead, it mentions using<br />
/target XXX Spirit<br />
/cast Rejuvenation(Rank 1)<br />
/targetlasttarget<br />
<br />
Where XXX: Eagle, Hawk, Falcon<br />
to keep the spirits alive.  Why not use Rank 1 Regrowth as its HoT last longer?  Cast time?</div></div><hr />

I will say that it completely sucked that my entire contribution got to be standing there casting HOTs on statues while my friends did the heavy lifting.... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feral tank druid (me)<br />
Warlock<br />
Warlock<br />
Mage<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
The one warlock had a lvl 70 tank that we brought in just for this fight.  So for Anzu we had <br />
<br />
Pally Tank<br />
Warlock<br />
Mage<br />
Priest <br />
(me in my healer gear)<br />
<br />
So the priest healed the raid and I put HOTs on the Eagle and Hawk spirts.  Those are the two that ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO BE UP AT ALL TIMES!!!!  Its the onlything that makes the bird packs easy to deal with.  My healing set is loaded with +int and +spi.  I off heal in Kara occassionally so my healer set is pretty substantial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my heal gear is not great. about +850 healing and i have just over 9k mana in heal gear.  so would need to bring a proper healer along as well but would allow me to dps for the rest of the run.<br />
<br />
there seem to be some very different views on this run.<br />
<br />
i need this flight form to add it to the other 3 epic flying mounts i have :elfgrin:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">04-01-2008, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got swift flight form last night.  The battle went very, very smoothly.  I (feral) kept HoTs on all 3 birds and threw a few on the tank when I remembered.  I had on my crappy healing kit with 3 items replaced with AH green +int pieces (over 11K mana).  Never used Innervate or a mana pot.  Had 52% mana left at the end.  And I did a battle rez of our mage after the first AoE phase.<br />
<br />
Group:<br />
Warrior<br />
Priest<br />
Shammy<br />
Mage<br />
Feral Druid (HoT duty).<br />
<br />
The other 4 players run this instance all the time in hopes of getting Anzu's mount (and badges).  Probably 1-3 times a week.  So, they know the battle inside and out.<br />
<br />
I made the 3 HoT macros shown on wowhead write-up and assigned my /focus to the Eagle spirit so I could monitor the HoT timer.  When the /focus's HoT was about to expire, I'd click thru the 3 macros one more time.  And then cast a HoT or two on our tank.</div></div><hr />

Got Epic flight form at last! As a casual player it's taken months to grind the gold, get the lower city rep, do the Q chain and then finally into the instance.<br />
<br />
Group consisted of warrior tank; mage; hunter; druid dps; druid healer.  My fellow druid was also gunning for the epic flight form.  To be honest, the hardest part of the run was the first boss - he literally 'wiped' the floor with us.... several times!<br />
<br />
Once we got past him the final fight was relatively easy. At the end of it all me and the other druid could say was 'Is that it?  Have we done it? Really?'  After months of effort we could hardly believe it!<br />
<br />
And isn't epic form the best!!<br />
<br />
Good luck to everyone else on this Q<br />

I also did a bit of solo grinding in order to get all of my PvE reps to honored (for heroic keys and nearly free PvP gear).  I had so many greens that dropped, I had a buddy DE them all.  And I sold the dusts.  Made quite a bit.  Plus daily quests (the old ones, this was pre-sunwell).<br />
<br />
I'm an AH whore, I buy lots of stuff on the AH.  If I didn't do that I'm sure I would have had 5Kg the moment I hit lvl 70.</div></div><hr />

<br />
finally got around to talking about this in /g last night as someone also wants a ton of LC rep so we might finally do it next week.<br />
<br />
re : making money i agree on DE greens and sell dust etc on AH. also being a herby is quite a good money maker still on my server.  and ofc the daily's.....i used to make 130g a day doing all 10 pre 2.4.  now you can do 25 its easier to make more money each day if you concentrate on doing them as often as you can.</div></div><hr />

So, it is worth doing this chain _before_ you reach exalted with CE (while trying to get your earthwarden).  I still have 10K to go, but every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
It is so tough to get groups to run hUB, hSP and/or SV right now.  I'm lucky if I can beg one group a week.  Might just have to pug it out.</div></div><hr />

We've done soo many and we do soo much raiding that people just generally don't want to spend time in instances.My guild doesn't raid (we run Kara maybe 1-2 times a month), but they seem to be alt-oholics and/or happy just running easier Outland instances.  I can get a group to run Mana Tombs in a second.  Heroics?  Run away!  There seems to be a very select few that are &quot;brave&quot; enough to handle them.  I sort of wish the heroic fear would just go away.  Once you've done 1-2, you realize that aren't all that bad, you just can't get away with being sloppy.</div></div><hr />

I'd also recommend levelling cooking and fishing - I make some nice gold from these skills.  Also you can get decent gold from other items fished.  Of course, as others have already said, the dailies can be a steady source of income.<br />
