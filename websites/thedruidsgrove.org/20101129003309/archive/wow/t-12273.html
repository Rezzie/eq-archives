I am considered a hybrid at the moment, but from here on out, I am sinking my points into balance.  I have found and gotten some good gear.  I have some in the bank for when I hit 39 also.  I try to get stuff with bonus healing and damage. I currently have 60 bonus, and 112 mana regen.  Is that good? I get some good crit hits, sometimes hitting for around 500.  Anyhow, how am I doing? I desparately seek the approval of my piers. :P LOL, j/k  Would appreciate opinions though. I have my armory page linked in sig! Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not too sure how great preOutlands balance gearing is but I'm going to guess that you may need to wear a lot more cloth as +dmg leather is not as common =/<br />
<br />
Statwise I think you should get  Int&gt;Stam&gt;Spirit. But I never played balance so I may be wrong D=<br />
<br />
good luck and happy leveling~</div></div><hr />

As Ms Trxitaa said, the balance gear pre-outlands seemed to be geared to clothies and that was not the best for Boomkins.<br />
<br />
You won't find a lot of +dmg gear, but pick up what you can.  Don't skimp on +stam or int.  Get Omen of Clarity when you can so you can be the melee boomkin for mana regen and free spells once you progress that far in your talent trees.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

That said, you should pick up quest rewards and boss drops that are compatible with your method of killing mobs and/or intended group role. Don't buy gear from the Auction House.</div></div><hr />
