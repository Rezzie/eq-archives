When you cast a group port spell open your blocked buff list and add &quot;Circle of whatever&quot; or &quot;Wind of whatever&quot;, like Circle of Grimling. When you cast the port everyone in the group near you will get sent there, but the druid stays. Just click off the blocked circle spell and you are gtg.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure this was not meant to work though, but I doubt it would be bannable either. Anyone have heard about this before?</div></div><hr />

Anyway it does work as Discanthir stated I tried it out like last saturday, I was in Frostcrypt and while there a group member needed to go to pok so I just put Circle of Knowledge in blocked buffs, dropped group invited the ranger with me ported and I stayed in Frostcrypt while she was in Plane of Knowledge, so this does work but eventually my belief is that the GMs will catch up and eventually deny us this ability and we are back to square 1</div></div><hr />

I thought about it for a bit before posting. We are already given teleports for the new expansions, showing that they don't think druids should never get the ability. They have said they will not do it for older expansions, and I am pretty sure the reason is purely not to step on anyone's toes, namely wizzies who would like it to stay a wiz only skill. This takes just a bit more effort than memming a spell and punting someone off. Druids need to add the spell to their block list (big woop there). There is still the main circle spell limitation.... have to be in group. You also need to be only grouped with the one(s) you want to teleport, be away from the rest of the group who don't wish to go, or make sure everyone else has the spell blocked for this to work. It also really helps out those of us who load very slowly. I know the only reason I ever refuse a port is because I take far too long to zone to certain places. I don't really see this has being a problem.</div></div><hr />
