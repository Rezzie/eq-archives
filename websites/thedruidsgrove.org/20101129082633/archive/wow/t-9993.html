I think its a great guide to many things druid.  This site actually convinced me to be a druid for my first character :)   I just joined the site tonight because its time I started posting.<br />
<br />
Ok and now to my point.  I noticed all the great, detailed info on a lot of the higher level instances level 35+, but I haven't seen any info/guides on the lower level instances (ex. DeadMines).  I know there are at least 3 instances that I can do now at level 22 but i forget the names of the other two.  It would be very helpful to a new player like myself to be able to read the info and know what to expect before making the bold venture into an instance.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again and you guys are great for creating and maintaining this site :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for instances, are you Alliance or Horde?<br />
<br />
If I'm remembering correctly...<br />
<br />
Alliance side, you have Deadmines, Blackfathom Deeps, and the Stockades.<br />
<br />
Horde side, you have Ragefire Chasm (kinda easy now), Wailing Caves, Blackfathom Deeps... and I think Shadowfang Keep.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can go to some of the opposing side's instances, but it's a bit tougher to find groups for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:) also, depending on whether your server is PvE or PvP it could be quite difficult to just survive and reach them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome!  This is a great place to get help.  Like the others have said, it would be helpful if you had given your Druids faction and type of server.  <br />
<br />
By your post mentioning Deadmines...I would make a guess that you are Alliance.  Your first instance would be The Deadmines.  As far as the first instance any faction can run....this is my favorite.  If you are on a PvP server then it will be easiest for you to do Deadmines and Stockades.  BFD isn't that hard to get to....just don't wander very far to the South of the entrance or you will find yourself running from Horde NPC's.<br />
<br />
If you are Horde then you would do Ragefire Chasm first, then Wailing Caverns and then you can choose between C=bFD and SFK.  Again, if you are on a PvP server then you might want to stay away from BFD....but the others are in friendly territory.  <br />
<br />
Now if you are on a PvE server then you can possibly get to some of the other factions instances.....but you have to be very careful.  Wailing Caverns has some nice Druid gear.<br />
<br />
Out of the lower instances...these, in my opinion, are the most enjoyable...<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
Stockades<br />
Wailing Caverns<br />
Shadowfang Keep<br />
<br />
And if you are doing Skinning and LW then you can skin some of the things you kill in WC and SFK.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  Good luck....and don't hesitate to ask any questions about these instances....we all had to do them at some point.</div></div><hr />

I am a Night Elf Druid (Alliance) on the Feathermoon RP-PVE server.  And I actually decided to join a group today and do the Deadmines instance.  It was alot of fun because I was able to be an off-tank and then fall back to a healer when necessary.  I appreciate the replys and hope to hear more about the other Instances and what lies inside of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will love it when you hit the 30's and can run Scarlet Monastery.  It's my favorite instance in the whole game (highest toon is a level 52).  <br />
<br />
Glad you had fun in Deadmines!<br />
<br />
Any time you have instance questions just ask!  I know that anyone here will be willing to help you out with information.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />
