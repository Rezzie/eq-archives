<br />
I rolled a tauren druid and now am a level 23.  It is fun, exciting, and has endless possibilities.<br />
<br />
What I hate is the comments.  I mean people rip into the class all the time.  I get whispers about how bad druids are - said in ways that are not very nice.  <br />
<br />
Warriors especially say things like, &quot;If you ever get in bear while I am around I'll...&quot;  <br />
<br />
The guild I am in said that I better not even think of doing anything besides restoration.<br />
<br />
Why is it that people have to trash on a solid support class that can really be beneficial to parties.  <br />
<br />
I hate the 'hate' and just want to play.  <br />
<br />
<br />
By the way - I am going feral - nothing beats switching back to a full mana bar to heal and keep going.</div></div><hr />

If anyone ever says ANYTHING bad about me, I will smash them.  It has happened a few times... &quot;wtf go back to healing dumbass your gonna aggro da entire grewp.&quot;<br />
<br />
(I abruptly ceased pulling/tanking and sat back watching them get slaughtered by level 25s in RFK.  After that, they begged me.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what I suggest.  Get yourself some levels, preferrably level 30.  Get some nice greens/blues, and ask them to come into XR or in front of ogrimmar.  Get a large crowd, and proceed to claw/maul their face off.<br />
<br />
I happened to do this to a rogue 6 levels higher than me last night who was potting the entire time...  I didn't hear anything out of his mouth afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
People who attack you, which has basically never happened to me, are attacking you because one of 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1.  They got smashed by a druid, and are looking for someone to harass who can't kill them.<br />
2.You need a new server, your current one is full of @ssholes.<br />

BTW, Warriors are newbie, I-Just-Started-WoW classes.  Except for the competent fury/arms build warriors who know how to build rage and use threat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, wide, sweeping statements like this one are to be avoided, I think. ;)  I have met many good warriors, of various talent specs, and yes, several bad warriors as well.  Like any other class, it all depends on the player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">12-04-2005, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not all the warriors are noobs.  Not all of anybody are noobs.  Best thing to the OP, leave your guild now.  Don't bother guilding up til later in levels.  And then, don't be afraid to leave if they don't respect you.  I didn't find the right guild for me until I was already level 60.  But when I found the people I want to play with, I knew right away that they were the group. <br />
<br />
You will break past that wall eventually.  At level 23, let what some punk says go in one ear and out the other.  They don't know what the game is about yet.<br />
<br />
A good group will know how to use any player.  I rarely MH anymore.  There are other druids in my guild who love to.  And I don't shy from it, but my guild knows my playstyle and my feral spec.  They bring me along because they know that I use every ounce of my skills to do what has to be done.  Like when I roll in a raid and though I never top any meters, I always out dps at least a couple hunters while out healing at least one priest or druid and out tanking at least one warrior.  <br />
<br />
And that same playstyle got me promoted to officer in my guild.  So not all people are narrow.  There are those you will meet that will let you be every bit of the druid that you want to be.  Whether that's take the reigns and main heal, roll with the bombers or get up close and personal.  Or like me and have fun with all three :)</div></div><hr />

I was in a PUG of all things in Scholomance.  Rattlegore dropped the SC boots.  The rogue told me to roll, because they were my set piece!

I can picture a world where a resto druid is healing, a moonkin is nuking, and three feral druids are tanking and dpsing.  Everyone would be able to help out everyone else in their roles as the need arises, including rezzing.<br />
<br />
Of course wouldn't be as effective as a group of dedicated role players (priest, mage, warrior, rogue), but would be a whole heck of a lot of fun, and how often do you really get into the archetypal group anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was nice switching alot, healing when needed, and tanking alot.  For the first time I didnt have someone complaining about something that is trivial.  <br />
<br />
Maybe an all druid guild would not be that efficient for everything, but it would be nice to know 10 strong druids who would like to do the all druid thing from time to time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not about pigeon holing, raiding is about being the most efficient you can and exploiting the best of each class. Druids heal great so they &quot;pigeon holed&quot; into doing that job on large scale raids. Classes such as Mages, Warlocks, Hunters, Rogues, Warriors, Priests, Shaman (no idea about Pallies as I'm Horde) umm...all classes...out DPS us.<br />
<br />
In a raid-centric game where DPS &gt; all for epic encounters, why would you use Druids for anything else?</div></div><hr />

Group would be fine for a relatively easy instance but harder ones you'd get owned without crowd control. I hate the way my CC abilities are so limited indoors, very frustrating. I can see why it is, but its just such a tease where so much of the important end-game is indoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Primerib</div><div class="date">12-05-2005, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The druid is IMO the most misunderstood, underestimated class in game. Even Blizzard downplays this class's abilities by offering only end game sets like Stormrage and Wildheart for PVE, sets that primarily focus on the caster/healer aspect of the class. But what those who have never played a druid fail to realize is that a druid can feasilby outdps a rogue in cat and square off against a warrior in bear. I have been a purely feral druid fighting against the healer stigma for the better part of a year now and tonight I gave up the battle and deleted my lv 55 tauren druid. I had previously given up on leveling until 1.8 and returned with the hopes that this patch would open the eyes of the rest of the classes to what all a druid really can do, alas this was not to be the case on Khadgar and I refuse to pay $15 a month to play my character to someone else's standards. It is afterall a game and as such is meant to be enjoyed. And I myself do not get enjoyment out of standing there and doing nothing but healing for the duration of an instance/battle. For those of you who enjoy playing a healer, you have my respect as well. Somebody has to do it and I appreciate you stepping forward. And for those who argue that if I wanted to DPS I should have rolled a rogue or a warrior had I wished to tank, my answer is simple, why? I can do all of these things w/ a druid and shapeshift into unique forms to do it. I could go on but those of you who are feral I'm sure have been/are in my shoes. And so I say good luck, keep up the fight and hopefully someday people will respect our other abilities the way they respect a shaman for being more than a healer.</div></div><hr />

You do make some great points - it is a game.  It is for fun.  It's meant to be enjoyed... it's not work.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't have as much fun in even a 5 man group as opposed to solo or with a friend.  I started this thread and now my mindset it different.  Who cares what people say - just play.<br />
<br />
In the real world we don't pick our race, specialties, or talents and we have found ways to manage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyin</div><div class="date">12-06-2005, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, true it is sh*tty to be able to backup heal when the main heal is out of mana, or off tank when needed, battle rez the tank if he takes a face plant in the middle of a fight, or DPS when not needed to fill emergency roles.<br />
<br />
The problem with druids as I see them is that there are too many that are not aware enough to quickly switch roles when needed.  They want to be DPS, tank, or healer, and not to switch up as needed. <br />
Too often I see a druid in cat form die without switching out to heal himself, or even try.  Cat druids are always low on my healing list.  If they can't be bothered to control agro in cat form then they can heal themselves (unless the tank is really bad).<br />
When I am playing MH in a group while letting another druid play DPS it pisses me off when I get smacked around while he stays in cat form and doesn't go bear to taunt adds off me.<br />
<br />
This is a problem that plagues a lot of classes, especially hunters and druids.  A general rule of thumb is assume a hunter is a moron untill proven innocent.  I guess that is for druids too, assume they can't walk and chew gum at the same time until they prove they can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fendicano</div><div class="date">12-09-2005, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have developed responses to comments that people come up with.  When a warrior busts on me for tanking I pose the question.  Can you pull with a 600 damage, 300 damage (+dot)?  No?  Then stfu.  With rogues, it's &quot;Can you heal yourself during combat if needed?&quot;  When a priest dogs on me I ask him when the was the last time he ran with a stealth group to the end boss of an instance so that he could heal the other stealthers.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that we can switch it up when we need to and other classes can't.  If a mob has high spell resist, a mage is screwed, where we just drop to a melee form.  When a mob has uber armor, warriors and rogues get the shaft.  My point is that where we get the shaft is being ALMOST as good as any one of them.  I don't consider that &quot;the shaft.&quot;  Almost as good as 4 different classes works for me just fine.</div></div><hr />

Thinking about it this way makes me appreciate playing the druid even more.  That's a great way of looking at this class.</div></div><hr />

His reasoning was I was over level 40 and had dire bear.  They were under 40 and had no plate.<br />
<br />
I said I would tank, dps, or heal, didn't care.<br />
No discussion given, just &quot;I'm tired of people saying that a druid can outtank a pally.  You all have ruined this group for me.  Bye. /leave&quot;<br />

There is the attitude that we hate.<br />
For the record, I would have rather played DPS and backup heal since I find tanking in PUGs really frustrating.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyin</div><div class="date">12-13-2005, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Update*<br />
Last night I was in another group with a pally tanking and I just kept my mouth shut and went cat dps while we ran through all of SM twice.<br />
Right at the end I told them that with the current buffs I had (Priest, Druid, and Pally) I had 3500 HPs and 4200 AC when I switched to dire bear.<br />
They then laughed at me for not offering to tank.  <br />
Much better group.  Everyone was friendly, wanted to enjoy themselves, and weren't uptight about their class or role.<br />
I wanted to make them aware that I could have tanked if needed so the next time they are LFM's they can call on me or another druid to tank if needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to be the main healer in ZF at the younger levels, or main heal Maraudon at all while it's level-appropriate, it'd be a good idea to respec into restoration.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nonsense.  I ran ZF as main healer at 46, and was fine.  We had a good tank (lv 50), two hunters and a mage.  At the time my spec was 0/31/5.<br />
<br />
I started running Mara at lv 48, and ran once as main tank, then at 49 as main healer.  Both times we did the entire orange and blue side.  Princess was quite a test - I had to use combat rezz and a 700-900mana pot, and everyone except for me and the tank (pally) died, but we took down princess, then the pally rezzed and everyone got to complete the quest.  Granted, the fight would have obviously been much easier if we had a preist, or even if I was able to innervate myself, but still, we finished.  Afterwards the group told me that I was one of the best druid healers they had ever played with, despite the level handicap.  The pally was astute enough to point out that I was full feral (he noticed the LoTP buff when I had to drop into cat to lose aggro against one mob), and everyone couldnt believe it.<br />
<br />
HoTW and some good +int / +healer gear, with NF = no problem to heal.  I did have to stop and drink a good bit, but that was no problem.</div></div><hr />

I did just fine healing with my healing gear and tanking with my bear gear.  Spec just isn't that important, at least not at these levels (I can't speak to end-game).<br />

I've seen a few around, and being solo myself (not really by choice or by circumstance, that's just how it appears to be at present), I'm not too sure if that's a good idea.  But with druids, they're so diverse I think folks could find a way to make it work.<br />
