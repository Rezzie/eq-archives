Agreed. Sony has once again taken somthing that was originally decent, and made them into somthing totally useless. <br />
<br />
Noone i have talked to is going to spend hours and hours and hours of slow Painful factioning to get the minimal upgrades these worthless augs give.<br />
<br />
---&gt;1 : They are too Narrow in use. they only work for ONE &quot;specific&quot; spell, and others in the spell line will never work.<br />
<br />
---&gt;2 : The upgrade on a single spell is definately not worth the effort it takes to get the augs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, factioning is not worth it if all you want is exactly one thing off the merchants, but if you want the other things it can be worth it: such as for the ladies of the night merchant in DSH.  For ally you get two augs and a rk2 spell ( preincarnation ). and factioning for LOTN is not too hard; can faction tap the nymphs that others are killing while you solo them, or get a full kiting group and slaughter them very fast ( 1 dru + 5 nec/wiz/mag is some awesome dps ). if camp is taken, just faction tap as others kill the nymphs.<br />
<br />
Most factions give you access to multiple items.<br />
<br />
I do hate factioning though.  Crusaders of veeshan is particularly painful to raise.<br />
<br />
Solo factioning is the worse ( slowest ) Mass factioning with a mini raid is the fastest, obviously.  So find a group already factioning and tap away while you maybe solo other mobs nearby.<br />
<br />
I like to tap using the lowest level heal spell; most groups dont mind this, but I always ask first. ( or low level debuff is good, like flamelick ) If you use a level one heal on a member of group that is full health, then they dont get a heal message and dont even know your faction tapping.</div></div><hr />

I actually enjoyed the logic behind velious factioning.  The fact that you had to do it to do the quest gear was kinda lame, but just because you were non-kos and could explore a city without being attacked is a lot of fun.  Especially when you start out kos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Besides SoF factioning is pretty rough for a soloer.  Mind you I don't solo all the time, but I like the option.  The biggest faction gains are from completing each mission like 10+ times.  Except for the rebel brownie one.  You get the quickest gains from multiple minotaur raids (the MMM raid access one) since you have kill like 100+ baby minos.</div></div><hr />
