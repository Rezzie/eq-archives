Perhaps you have not gotten responses because we may be failing to understand what you mean by &quot;key&quot; setups. Do you mean gear, spec, tactics, or something else?</div></div><hr />

I personally don't PvP, so I can't help here.  But I hopefully that clears things up (if, in fact, it's what he meant).</div></div><hr />

Ah that makes sense, I thought he meant it as in the &quot;key&quot; to success in PvP.<br />
<br />
I do PvP but I am not a &quot;hotkey&quot; person, I'm a Macro/Mouse Person. I only use keys 1-4 for attacks because I'm keyboard retarded, everything else I have grouped together as icons in a manner that suits me.<br />
<br />
I use Insomniax and a few other choice mods, such as Druidbar.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in a couple of Macros, I can help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pray</div><div class="date">08-11-2005, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">every skill i use in pvp is binded to 1-6 using nothing, alt, or shift...<br />
<br />
Makes for very fast reaction times.<br />
<br />
Also I have druid bar which makes shifting on the fly a breeze. Also, bear form is set to 7 on the num pad, aquatic 8, cat 9, travel4.<br />
<br />
I have all my cooldowned abilities on 2 bars, that way if i'm not in that form, i can still glance over and see how much time i have on, bash per say, even when i'm in caster form.<br />
<br />
Also very important to get the cooldown count mod. Helps in pvp and pve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Number Keys 1-0 set up for casting and mêlée<br />
Shift 1-0 set up for heals, buffs, hibernates<br />
Ctrl 1-0 Misc hibernate, sooth, potions</div></div><hr />

And I thought that maybe some of you had 2 different setups, depending on the situation your are confronted with. I imagine that it isnt the same thing fighting a mob or a horde/alliance that suddenly pops in your face and starts eating your guts in an impolite way.<br />
<br />
For normal encounters (mobs), I have numpadded:<br />
<br />
1: Melee attack<br />
2: Root<br />
3: Moonfire<br />
4: Starfire<br />
5: Wrath<br />
6: Faerie Fire<br />
7: Assist (dunno what its doing there, habit from EQ, i guess)<br />
8: Rejuvenation<br />
9: Regrowth<br />
10(/): HT<br />
11(*): Tranquility<br />
12(-): Nature's grasp<br />
<br />
But I could imagine, that some of them should be replaced (1, 4, 7) by others when encountering horde/alliance and that some of you had given it some thought/experience.<br />
<br />

I use a customized flexbar that swaps out keys 1-8 depending on my target. if I have something hostile targeted and I'm in caster form it's <br />
1. moonfire<br />
2. wrath<br />
3. starfire<br />
4. root<br />
5. faerie fire<br />
6. hibernate<br />
7. soothe animal(lol was just lookin to fill slots, I don't think I've ever used it for any reason)<br />
8. Omen of clarity<br />
when I'm in caster and I have another alliance member targeted it swaps those buttons to<br />
1. rejuv<br />
2. regrowth<br />
3. healing touch<br />
4. remove curse<br />
5. remove poison<br />
6. abolish poison<br />
7. Motw<br />
8. Thorns<br />
It swaps to this when I'm in bearform<br />
1. feral charge<br />
2. maul<br />
3. bear stun<br />
4. demoralizing roar<br />
5. swipe<br />
6. attack<br />
7. enrage<br />
8. frenzied regen<br />
and in catform<br />
1. prowl<br />
2. claw<br />
3. rake<br />
4. shred<br />
5. ferocious bite<br />
6. rip<br />
7. track humanoids<br />
8. dash<br />
and when I prowl it swaps buttons 1-3 to be<br />
1. tiger's fury<br />
2. ravage<br />
3. pounce<br />
for the most part all of the most important skills are attached to buttons 1-4 :D Makes things very accessable for heated pvp situations</div></div><hr />
