Sux that rake doesn't crit, however i'm loving 3.1 kitty. Doing my own theory crafting.. It seems like crit would have deminishing gains the higher it gets, especially with the hard miss cap at 25%. In addition I already have close to 60%ish?? crit raid buffed. so in addition to getting less from each point of crit, I'm also factoring that fact that that ATK from Strength is increasing 60% (maybe even +25% miss.. so 85%) of our hits</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was always under the impression that you wanted to get to 50% crit self buffed then start focusing on Str.  Is that incorrect???<br />
<br />
Kitty is definatley not my strong suit, but I seem to remember that being the case.  The DR on Agi becomes pretty significant after 50% crit is acheived.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One advantage of geming ArmPen rather than Agi is you get a more consistent &quot;rotation&quot; as your crit is a bit lower (fewer wasted CP).  But your shred and white damage will improve with ArmPen.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm geming for agi as I replace my tier pieces and ArmPen in my non-set slots.</div></div><hr />
