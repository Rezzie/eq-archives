Where is a good spot to solo (completely solo)? No summoning stuff either! :) Just to snare / root / DoT / Blast sort of mobs. I have some old spots that I go, but wanted to know if there are any new spots so that I can see some new scenery. Thanks for any and all help.</div></div><hr />

Icefall - Err, just about anything :p<br />
The Buried Sea - Pirates, huge amounts of animals around the zone. Several islands you can try, would give you plenty of new scenery.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
DON:<br />
The Nest Instances- Mainly the Lair of the Black Wing is the best to do nothing summons<br />
The Stillmoon Instances- Mainly the Creator mission<br />
 <br />
TSS:<br />
Icefall-all as Micahle stated except for the Griffin mobs and nameds.<br />
Valdeholm-the oozes at the west side of pit, the white cons to level 75 summon, some spiders in the eastern side of pit dont summon but not a lot.<br />
Direwind-Bears, Griffins, and Roots of the Black Oak as Micahle mentioned, there are also those Gnolls near the AG gate that u can kite the Ratkins turn into giant rats while the Ratcallers summon about 4 or 5 rats, the Bone yard is also doable, just get into that little cubby at the northen side of camp and use the level 71 calm spell Nature's Placidity spell to split just dont pull the nameds.<br />
 <br />
TBS:<br />
Katta-Greenhouse as Ohioastro mentioned<br />
Atiiki-Everything is kiteable .... I mean everything *Nameds included*:thumbup: <br />
Thalassius-Stick with the Turtles, Crab creatures, the snakelike mobs, Rockcrusher dont summon and is kiteable</div></div><hr />

 <br />
dblue, whites and yellows, easy to port to druid vendor to sell if need be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ohioastro</div><div class="date">10-01-2007, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Efreeti in Atiki.  Three to four AAs/hour, depending on the mix of mobs and your ability to maintain a rhythm.  They can be snared and rooted and do not summon (even the named Hand of X mobs).  A set of six dots (including clicky swarm) will take them roughly to half health.  Start round #2 then pull another.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  You will need 2 junk buffs in front for sorcerors, who occasionally dispel.  Enthrallers require 4 junk buffs in front.  Both enthrallers and sorcerors can gate (lords are straight melee).  However, as with all gating mobs, they do not gate if they don't have line of sight to you - so laying down enough dots to drop them to low health and ducking around the corner will remove this annoyance.  There are pathing glitches if you climb up on hills, but aggro radius is very small - e.g. if you see 2 efreeti standing on both sides of a staircase you can pull one without drawing the other.<br />
<br />
Animal charming in Direwind can be pretty good experience as well, but the roots are probably the fastest for soloers still.</div></div><hr />

   I've yet to find a mob in the zone that will summon.  I was getting decent AA there when i worked on the hand aug which is worth the effort if you need AA and are able to kite.  Kills 2 birds with one stone and the mobs there are blue-yellow with resists low enough to allow us to use the AA snare we were given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-09-2008, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an addendum to the TBS post above from Xarra, named animals have about a 50% chance of summoning. The Siren named dont, the gorilla named doesnt, the gali named doesnt, and the snake on gali island doesnt... I think all the other named animals do though. Even if not Pythos - named snaked - (sp) does a 2500 DD plus DoT and Bloody Marc - named pirate - does a 24 sec stun which both typically means death.<br />
<br />
TBS is a great place to solo but make sure you have Exodus ready if you are pulling a named you arent sure about yet. :) Of course that wont save you while you are stunned from Marc...</div></div><hr />

What I would do is get them low enough health so they just sit there get about 3-4 of em like that then pop llesson and pow 4 quick kills off the bat and whole lesson left to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">06-11-2008, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That works well on mammoths in Icefall too. I can swarm kite/charm until I have 5-6 at less than 10% and then go charm a new one, send him in, pop lesson as he moseys on over and then all low health ones are gone pretty quick between he and I, with enough lesson left to repeat the whole process again.</div></div><hr />
