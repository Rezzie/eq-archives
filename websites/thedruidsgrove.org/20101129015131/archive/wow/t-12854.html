I like Avatars.  It helps to put a visual of some kind to each name.  Also it makes forums look really pretty with lots of little stamp-sized pieces of art :&gt;<br />

I had the coolest hybrid cat-bear-elf face frame, but it is much too large and shrinking it down makes it lose so so much detail :(<br />
<br />
I was going to ask about signatures because I was going to put together something fun...but all I had was a jpg file, it wasn't actually on a website or anything... I &quot;have&quot; knowledge of things...it's usually the application process that I fail at.<br />
<br />
I'd be a gold mine for a tutor I'm sure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other thing to double check if you're sure you're doing it right, is that the avatar you are trying to use isn't too big.  Avatars on these particular forums are allowed to be a maximum of 100 pixels across by 100 pixels up/down.  If you try to upload an avatar that is larger than this, you will either get an error message or it will report that it has worked but the avatar won't actually show up.  If you think this might be the cause of the problem, try right-clicking the image you are trying to use as an avatar, then choose &quot;Properties&quot; from the context menu.  A window appears, if you look through the information in that window it will tell you the number of pixels horizontally and vertically.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's worth spending a little while getting used to how the forums work, and learning about some of the features they provide.  Why?  Well, two reasons.<br />
<br />
1. Because it helps you to express yourself better over the internet if you know a little about BBcode and the typical features you can expect a forum to have.<br />
<br />
2.  Because if you someday apply to join a hardcore raiding guild, it can greatly assist your application if you show some ability to use BBcode for formatting, you instantly create an avatar and signature, etc.  It's just another method of showing your commitment to the guild in question, and your competence in all areas; most guilds use their forums as the primary means of organising raids, so if you can demonstrate your ability to use them effectively that will be a big plus in your application.  :&gt;<br />

<br />
I followed his link, and now I have a &quot;Destinae's Avatar&quot; link under my name...Destinae + Avatar = Fail<br />
<br />
It is 99px by 99px and is only 2.74 KB or so...it &quot;should work&quot; but it doesn't want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBcode is the name we give to the special codes you can put into your post to create bold, italics, and other formatting.  BBcode stands for Bulletin Board Code.  On these particular forums it's actually called vBcode, because these forums are vBulletin forums; vBulletin is the name of the forum software.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Unformatted text:<br />
Last night I had a dream.  It was about beatyful duriods !<br />
<br />
2.  Formatted text:<br />
Last night I had a dream.  It was about beatyful duriods !<br />
<br />
To create the formatting, use square brackets, like this: [ ]<br />
<br />
Inside the square brackets, we put a word or a letter, depending on what we want to do.  For example, put the letter &quot;B&quot; into the square brackets to get Bold Text.<br />
<br />
When you get to the end of the bit you want to make bold, make a &quot;close&quot; tag.  So for bold, it would be [/ ] (just insert a B after the &quot;/&quot;)<br />
<br />
So just to be clear, [ ] is the &quot;open&quot; tag, and [/ ] is the &quot;close&quot; tag.  Whatever appears between those two, will be affected by the formatting:<br />
This text is not affected by formatting, but [ ]this text is.[/ ]<br />
<br />
<br />
It's quite tricky explaining this on a forum because if I actually write the code exactly, it will just make stuff bold instead of showing the code for it :p  But hopefully you get the idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a short list of things you can put in square brackets:<br />
<br />
b -&gt; Bold<br />
i  -&gt; Italics<br />
u -&gt; Underline<br />
<br />
quote -&gt; Quote boxes<br />
<br />
quote=&quot;name&quot; -&gt;  indicate who it is you are quoting - the CLOSE tag for this is the same as the CLOSE tag for the above type of quote code, ie like this (remove the space) [ /quote]<br />
<br />
img -&gt; inserts an image - just put the link to the image between the open and close tags, and nothing else.  For example:<br />
<br />
http://kingdomcome.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/03/03/join_team_leaf_3.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
If you still need some help and my &quot;tried-my-best&quot; examples are too sucky (heh), click the Quote button on the bottom-right of my post.  That will allow you to see all the codes I used to create this post :&gt;<br />

I got my avatar to work!  Phew! <br />
<br />
 The signature requires a URL, according to the user CP.  I'm not entirely sure how to go about it, but maybe I'll give it a try...<br />
<br />
Or, am I just dense?</div></div><hr />
