With BC coming out soon I still plan to be a restoration spec but don't plan on getting Tree of Life. With that in mind and knowing my usual play is teamed with a Hunter I will go Balance with my remaining points. However I'm not sure if I should go 21/0/40 or 23/0/38.<br />
<br />
The way things are going I might be moving to a more int centric gear set up vs. a +Healing set up. with that in mind Lunar Guidance might prove more useful in my grind (not raiding). I'm not so sure yet and of course I don't like respec'ing because I'm saving for my epic mount.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight into this would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You'll have decent nukes, decent healing, and a good mana pool. Since you're not a raider, u might want to stop at 21pts for Restoration, just for NS only.<br />
<br />
I'm going 27/0/24 when the next patch comes in with 41pt talents. I'm focusing on spell efficiency, with 3pts in Moonglow and 5pts in Tranquil Spirit. I'm a raider though, so I have a different focus. My rejuvs do about ~420 a tick without Improved Rejuv or Empowered Rejuv, so I'm gonna skip all those HoT talents. :O</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't have Imp Rejuv even while raiding? That's interesting as I've just started raiding this month so I might respec if it's not very useful.</div></div><hr />

However, on beta, they changed the whole HoT mechanics, so you get a bigger rejuv without spec. Without spec on beta (no imp rejuv, no nature's gift, etc etc), my rejuv is ticking for ~420. With full Restore spec on beta, my rejuv ticks for ~550 caster form, and like ~575 tree form.</div></div><hr />
