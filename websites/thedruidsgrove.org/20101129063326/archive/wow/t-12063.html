<br />
Just about to hit level 70, to my guild's excitement - :dance:   (whereas I have officially taken the prize for longest time to level a character) :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyway....they asked me about my PvP points.  Which, I virtually have - none.  OK, at the time I had about 1475.  Which is, I'm told, pretty much - none.  <br />
<br />
Quite frankly, I've never PvP'd.  I quest and I run dungeons.  Battlegrounds have just never interested me.  From time to time, it's a change.  Ho Hum.<br />
<br />
My Guild was shocked!  Shocked I tell you!  :confused:  I was a little embarrassed!<br />
<br />
1.  Why would my Guild care so much?<br />
<br />
     A)  Am I supposed to be PvP'ing?<br />
<br />
     B)  Is PvP a requirement for something?<br />
<br />
     C)  What do I do with my PvP Badges?  I get the gear thing, but is PvP Gear better somehow?<br />
<br />
     D)  How is my PvP History going to help my Guild?<br />
<br />
     E)  Am I the only one who doesn't know any of this?<br />
<br />
Sigh.<br />
<br />
As an afterthought, I think it's important to let all of you know that I have started running AV, AB + WsG.....and I'm loving it!  What fun when you actually give it a go!</div></div><hr />

Personally, I don't really care about it. I play on an normal RP realm, and only PvP when I think it might be interesting. To each his/her own, I guess. Congrats on the leveling, BTW - may have taken a while, but you earned it.</div></div><hr />

I leveled a hunter on a PvP server and he only has ~400 lifetime kills, including ~10 AV runs and that's it.  I only ran AV to get a larger/faster quiver.<br />
<br />
My level 46 Druid has 0 (I think) kills.  I have no interest in PvP.  Never have really liked it at all.  It makes me feel like $hit, so why would I want to do it?<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with not doing PvP.  In fact, with my Hunter (leveled on a PvP server), my only PvP move was &quot;/sit&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If I hit level 58 (Outlands here I come) by Xmas, I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

I started playing in December, and finally dinged 70 in like July, or maybe August, so i feel your pain.<br />

 My opinion is that your guildies are probably more surprised than anything... If you're on a PvP server, why not PvP? While you don't HAVE to by any means, you can get some pretty sweet gear rewards for doing it. I have the pendant of the horde and my Black War Kodo from doing BG's. I had all the necessary honor and marks before i even dinged 60 and had all the gold for the riding skill. I never spent a cent on a mount that i didn't have to...<br />
If you're horde, go to hall of legends in Org, and if you're Alli do to (?) Champions Hall (?) somewhere and spend your Honor and Marks on PvP gear. PvP gear is great (from what i understand) for PvP play, and not so much for PvE play (see gear thread and burst damage vs. sustained damage)<br />
While I have NO idea how PvP history helps your guild, i do know that there are a couple of guilds on my server known for their PvP skills. GVillians, to name one... Alli see the guild tag and either attack (thinking that they can bring a can of whoop-ass with them) or just turn and run... Arena history also helps get your guild's name out there i suppose... <br />
I'm sure i don't know all of the intracacies (sp?) of PvP, these are more MY opinions and ideas than anything else... I would HATE getting ganked while leveling, say, RIGHT after finishing a fight with difficult mobs to have a rogue unstealth and own me, and for a LONG time swore that as soon as i dinged 70 i would spend a month in STV by nesingway ganking any alli that MOVED lol... my resentments have been put aside since then though...<br />
The thing that i love most about PvP is that you're going up against another PERSON, and when you kill someone, you know that halfway across the country, somone somewhere is pissed at getting kapwnaged...</div></div><hr />

Ok, to give the perspective from someone that did the &quot;Old Style&quot; pvp back when you had to maintain ranks ( I only got to Marshal though ), pvp USED to give ferals some of the best gear for both PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
While that has changed considerably, there are still some very good pieces that you can get from pvp'ing that are useful in pve ( getting resilience to reduce how much def you need to become uncrittable for example ).<br />
<br />
PvP provides situations for you to really be dynamic and adjust to constantly changing situations, something that a druid can really excel ( and SEEM over powered at doing ).  We can shift to cat to dps, pop out and heal someone taking too much damage and pop to bear to charge and interrupt a spell or get someone/something off a clothie.<br />
<br />
PvP just helps to harness the ability to quickly adjust, to where it nearly becomes second nature.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Marks of Honor&quot; that you get from AB, AV, and WSG can get you some decent gear.  Arena points ( from having arena teams ) is what will get you some of the more beneficial gear though.  That will come in handy when tanking and/or dps'ing in many cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Grats on 70 :)<br />
<br />
No, you don't NEED to PvP, and it's not odd that you didn't until now.  Try it, if you like it continue, if you don't, find what you do like.  There is a LOT to this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably should have mentionned this, (sorry), but.....<br />
<br />
I am on a PvE server.  Which is why, after my guildies' reaction to my low PvP numbers, I thought that maybe I was missing an important aspect to PvP.<br />
<br />
I guess though, in retrospect, my guildies are probably surprised that I spend so little time on a battlefield whereas that's pretty much the only place PvE character get's to &quot;bring it&quot; with other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">10-04-2007, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also used to PvP a fair amount when honor got you rank but didn't buy gear and I think the system now is better, but clearly the most bang for your buck comes from the arena system. The gear from arena rewards is simply awesome, virtually regardless of your specc (Resto probably gets the least benefit). Still, there are a few pieces of gear that are worth getting PvP honor for. The &quot;PvP trinket&quot; is a great example (in case you don't know, it's a trinket that removes all movement impairing effects on use and can only be bought with honor points), and the gems are pretty good too. Outside of that, the benefit of the rewards depends on your specc and the gear you already have. <br />
<br />
I would recommend you get onto a 5v5 arena team ASAP and start getting arena points. Even if your team sucks &lt;points finger at self&gt; you still get enough points to get a great piece of gear every month or so, and as your gear improves so should your rank-&gt;more points-&gt;better gear-&gt;higher rank.....<br />
<br />
A 2v2 or 3v3 team will also get you points, just not as many. Blizzard recently modified the formula to make the smaller groups more attractive, but 5v5 is still clearly the way to earn the most points. The smaller ones are a great way to practice your skills though.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you do, and whatever it is, if you don't enjoy it, don't do it. It's not worth doing things you don't enjoy during your recreation time.</div></div><hr />

My druid's on a PvE server, so I really don't have the fire in my blood to go around with him and do PvP. Mainly because I'm simply having fun with him and hording all agility I can get. Hehe. Thus, I die kind of fast with slight lack of armor and stam.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
And then I have my priest on a PvP realm, and still only ran WSG a few times at lvl 19 for a ring which I replaced kind of quickly. And I still don't do much fighting in Contested areas. Whenever I see a Horde, I would literally just walk past them, and if I see them running after me/casting a spell, I'd just PW:S+Renew and keep moving (Probably not a good idea, of course).<br />
 <br />

Meh. PvP's not my thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong.. PvE:ing can be superfun and exciting at times.. but I always favoured fighting real, improvising people more challenging than fighting a program created to fight in a predetermined pattern.<br />
<br />
If you don't like PvP.. well, you don't.. and you ofc don't have to waste your time doing it if you don't like it.. but you're missing out on a nice aspect of WoW imho. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a generality, pvp gear is better for pvp, and pve gear is better for pve.<br />
Some pvp items are considered as being pretty essential, such as the trinket which breaks all movement-impairing effects and effects that cause you to lose control of your character.<br />
<br />
If you run out of items to spend your badges on, you can spend them on combat potions instead.  These are equivalent to major healing potions and major mana potions.  They can be used outside of pvp too, and they only cost 2 badges each.  If you pvp regularly you will swiftly accumulate 100 of each type of badge, and combat potions is a very good way of spending them.<br />
