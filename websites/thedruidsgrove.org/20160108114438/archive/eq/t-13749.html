<br />
How do you tackle undocumented encounters new to you, while trying to learn the event at the same time as keeping the raid free from waiting endlessly?<br />
<br />
Certain event's I've been able to fool around with a single group to learn what i can before bringing a raid, but other event seem to leave no option but to trial and error from square one with a raid in tow.  <br />
<br />
Pretty much I expect there to be no real answer besides &quot;your best shot&quot;.. but regardless, has anyone found any rules of thumb to go by?<br />
<br />
like.. send in a monk to figure out if there's AEs before engaging...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go hit it and see if we can make it dead.<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty much learning more about the encounter through repeated attempts, refining the strat, and trying not to die in the process.<br />
<br />
However, I'm sure we could send in Nilwean to check AEs... &gt;:P</div></div><hr />

Tanks are ready to tank or kite. Enchanters/Bards are ready to mez. We just expect anything on our very first try. We are obviously gonna wipe, but we need to do whatever it takes to see how the event goes later into it.<br />
<br />
Assume the mob has rampage, be ready for any emotes, quickly look for the AEs in Lucy, etc.</div></div><hr />
