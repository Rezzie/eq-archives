<br />
It would be a real downer to have the same 'ole upgrades to current lines, such as upgraded fire/cold, damage shield, wolf form, root, strength etc...<br />
<br />
I'll start off:<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;For AA's I'd like to see:  &lt;/strong&gt;<br />
- hastened spirit of the wood<br />
- innate spirit of the wolf (insta-cast, 2sec delay)<br />
- sort track by distance option<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;For spells:  &lt;/strong&gt;<br />
- Personally, I've always wanted an upgrade to Spirit of Cheetah (ie: 2 min recast, longer then 45 second duration)<br />
- Tangling Vines: reduces melee range.  Personally I hate small spaces in a dungeon where you can't sit to med 'cuz the mob can hit you across the room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LilWolf</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see...<br />
<br />
upgrade of Scale of Wolf / Cheeta.... That you can't attack.. but doesn't drop if someone attacks you... Or stacks with SoW so you would actually see it.  Or maybe a self only AA that they will last throught an attack.<br />
<br />
DS upgrades.  Something to make them useful again.  When was the last time that someone went out of their way to request one?  (other then PLing)<br />
<br />
PL upgrades!  How about being to cast a spell that will directly create XP if the member is 5 lvls or below!  Or better yet... You can /testbuf others up to 5 lvls below your lvl.  But it will have only 1/3 of the skills... But only if the character has a l33T name!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...the LDON site doesn't say anything about new abilities.  It mentions new spells...not new AA's.  That may be meaningful, considering how many balance issues seem to arise from AA.<br />
<br />
On the spell front, cheetah (even an upgraded one) is a waste.  This is a dungeon only expansion and cheetah is outdoor only.  I don't see them adding an indoor one (and besides anything you might need to run from it is better to exodus from so you save other people too...failing that it probably would just summon you anyway).<br />
<br />
Snare is a minor thing.  There really isn't any benefit to having it snare for a higher % other than stacking issues.  A lure type check is nice but unlikely to happen.<br />
<br />
What I expect is more development in the cold resistance debuff line.  Now that we have it they can flesh it out without causing too much harm.<br />
<br />
I also expect some sort of spell in the heal lines, though how it will be positioned I am not sure.  They usually work in one real good thing.<br />
<br />
Looking back over prior expansions you can be pretty sure that there will be at least one spell that we are really happy about.<br />
<br />
My gut tells me that there will be some sort of nice self buff since those are easy to add, gratifying to have, and can be most easily balanced.  If I had to guess I would say something like Yaulp (without the mana regen and atk), voice of the berzerker, shield of maelin etc.<br />
<br />
You might think &quot;but we already have the mask line and the coat line&quot; but neither of those really does what many other caster classes get - buff statistics including resists, multiple at a shot.<br />
<br />
Dmg could use a bump but with 2 new nukes and 2 new dots with POP I am not sure how they would work it in...perhaps faster cast time/lower dmg spells which would be used situationally.  Not sure they would add a new big nuke (anything they do on that front should be about adjusting the two we have now).<br />
<br />
Could see some class (if not druids someone) getting an upgrade to GRC.  Either a group version (even with fewer counters) or a larger remove.  Most stuff that they mean to be removed can be with GRC though.  <br />
<br />
At any rate we will see it in a few months.  Fun to think about it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want an AA skill, say 3 levels, that gradually removes the outdoor-only restriction from spells up through a certain level (so that at level 3, all outdoor only restrictions are removed).<br />
<br />
Make it a 5/10/15 AA skill.   Still be well worth the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">L1ndara</div><div class="date">06-19-2003, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;strong&gt;I want an AA skill, say 3 levels, that gradually removes the outdoor-only restriction from spells up through a certain level (so that at level 3, all outdoor only restrictions are removed).&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
 <br />
  That would ruin all the spell ideas they currently have for LDoN!  Harmony of the Stalker, Breath of the Stalker, Spirit of the Stalker and Fist of the Stalker.  It would also &quot;break&quot; the outdoor-only 48% rez spell spell they're planning, Nature's Regurgitation.<br />
 <br />
  I think the last expansions have pretty much filled up the druid spellbook with usless group versions of useless single target spells and druids are almost out of spells that they can make a super-high-level componentless versions of.  So expect a group version of Nature's Recovery, blargh.  Other than that, druids are sitting fairly pretty, SOE is pretty much at the point where they have to give druids some completely new useless stuff.<br />
 <br />
  Clerics... pre-grats on a group version of Temperance and group versions of the entire Blessing of XXX line!</div></div><hr />

Isnt there 13 pages of this already? <br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
Hey, that's not an idea!  :p <br />
<br />
Perhaps you're right oddjob, although I'm trying to think more down the lines of &lt;em&gt;previous expansion&lt;/em&gt; Spell / AA upgrades, and what I would like to see different.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm tired of seeing strength, root, and damage shield upgrades.  Granted, the damageless root was a welcome addition for certain situations.  The DS line is watered down though, and unless it's dynamics change...  /bleh<br />
<br />
Perhaps I jumped the gun.<br />
<br />
The last time we saw lucy data on expansion spells, some very constructive feedback was given by Grove members.<br />
<br />
 - A single version of our new HP buff was put in (remember self buffing with Glades?)<br />
 - The stacking of Nine and Kazad was tweaked to bring it in-line with Virtue for HP's<br />
 - Spirit of Eagle had a group buff variant made<br />
 - I think the Replenishment spells also gained 5 extra ticks over the initial test version<br />
<br />
Point is, hopefully with some creativity some of our thoughts will be considered.  That's the hope I have to come out of this.<br />

<br />
A new expansion doesn't negate the content of all previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Okay okay, that spell is just a personal beef.  One day I can outrun everyone and everything (save a bard) for 45 seconds, once every 10 minutes.  The next day expansion comes out and any rich man/woman can go out and buy that kind of speed.  A personal thing I never really got over...<br />

<br />
Hey, they did say they wanted to take another look at DoT dynamics right?!  Specifically, how underpowered the focus items are with dots compared to their desire.<br />
<br />
Perhaps more then just focus items will be used on dot effectiveness.  Ie: A buff, kind of like the cleric blessing of reverence.  Although I could see Necro's getting something like that before Druids.<br />
<br />
Then again... the completely unique spell &lt;em&gt;Spellshield&lt;/em&gt; (wizard rune vs. spell damage) seems to me more like a mage spell then wizard spell, so you never know!  Personally I wish more unique spells like that were given to all classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ackar</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about an AA that increases the AE range of succor?<br />
<br />
Or would you rather have stragglers be left behind to learn a lesson on staying close. :evil: <br />
<br />
&lt;hr /&gt;<br />
<br />
How about Sony borrows from other upcoming games and increase the forms druids can take.  An indoor &lt;em&gt;Form of the Howler&lt;/em&gt; spell that uses the spider model might be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilleyEskimo</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see us getting more utility spells and less nukes/DoTs in this expansion.  A new heal will probably be introduced, as Oldoaktree mentioned.  Nothing too overpowering, but something to possibly fill in the gaps.<br />
<br />
As far as AAs are concerned, if they give us more, I hope they are original like many of our PoP abilities.  Sotw, Wotw, and RC have definately added to my enjoyment of the game.  Those are fun and useful skills that I was happy to earn.  Adding increased Healing and nuking AAs were also a good move.<br />
<br />
Maybe another AA skill that causes some dmg, like Wotw sice our other PoP abilites focus on healing/curing.<br />
<br />
Btw, Sotw should have it's recast go down for every level you gain.  Same with RC.  RC should refresh every minute when maxxed and sotw every 5 minutes.  20 minutes on Sotw sucks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Overies</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a fun aa id like to see is:<br />
<br />
Run of the Cheetah:<br />
<br />
Spell effect:<br />
<br />
self only or group version of spirit of cheetah that ***STACKS** with other runspeed buffs, so that it can be a viable escape method (rebuffing SOW/SOE after using cheetah makes nobody want to use cheetah, plus the whole taking up a spell slot thing)<br />
<br />
maybe even have your speed / duration of this spell go up with more points put into it<br />
<br />
Reuse time: /shrug .. depends whether SoE would let us have this just as an escape type spell, or as a general run faster every once and a while spell. since we get exodus already, and its an hour and 12 min recast, something along the line of 20 mins for this (or perhaps even less) would be nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MAIN POINT:<br />
<br />
this should STACK with everything so that when it wears off you get your old buff back and dont have to rebuff (if it doesn't, consider it pretty much useless)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bdg55</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">going back to an old suggestion of mine:<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Upgraded Track&lt;/strong&gt; (class AA, 3 levels, 3/6/9)<br />
<br />
level 1: 15 increase to track, ability to sort by name<br />
level 2: 15 increase to track, ability to sort by distance<br />
level 3: 25 increase to track, ability to sort by con (green/lt.blue/dk.blue...)<br />
<br />
18 aa points to get track up to: 180 with full sorting abilities<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Hasted MGB&lt;/strong&gt;  (planar AA, 3 levels, 3/6/9)<br />
<br />
decreases refresh time of MGB by 10% per level<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
as well, i'd really like to see SotW refresh time decreased so that it makes it a more worthwhile AA and that we are not holding onto it for mgb purposes all the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilleyEskimo</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Hasted MGB (planar AA, 3 levels, 3/6/9)<br />
<br />
decreases refresh time of MGB by 10% per level[/quote]<br />
<br />
I'd buy that.  However, I think it should be 3/3/3, or even 2/2/2.  MGB is not an overpowering effect, it just speeds up the raiding process.<br />
<br />
Also, I would hope that if we got a new healing spell that it would be a group heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spells<br />
<br />
Somekind of DA/DB spell, or maybe a spell that transfer agro from your self to another group member. Long recast time, so u cant use it if u screw up all the time, but only when really needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Firemynd</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Priests have AA abilities which enhance/improve healing, direct damage, buffing, and druids also have AA for improving evacs. <br />
<br />
I would like to see an AA ability (or set thereof) which enhances damage-over-time spells.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Affliction Adept&lt;/span&gt; - extend duration of DoTs by 10% per level of mastery, can train once per level beginning at 61st.<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Affliction Mastery&lt;/span&gt; - decrease mana use for DoTs by 5, 10, 25%, can train at 61st, 63rd, 65th. <br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Affliction Strike&lt;/span&gt; - allows a chance of critical (double) damage during each round of a DoT's duration. Chance of critical is 5, 10, 15%.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see a few new AAs:<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Guardian of Tunare&lt;/span&gt; - summons a bear spirit which can be commanded to guard a single player; when that person is attacked, the spirit would impart a 500 point heal each tic for 3 tics, then the spirit disperses. Refresh time 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Animal Empathy&lt;/span&gt; - single target unresistable mesmerization of any mob flagged as animal. Duration 1 minute, Refresh 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Woodland Steed&lt;/span&gt; - summons a unicorn mount with 110% movement rate increase. Duration: until dismounted. (hey if knights who don't even have SoW spells can summon super fast steeds...)<br />
<br />
As for new spells:<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Oakskin&lt;/span&gt; - adds 800 hp, 40ac, 5 hp regen (no mana regen).<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Instinct&lt;/span&gt; - temporarily increases target's damage avoidance skills: +10% dodge, +10% defense, 10% block, 10% parry.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Winds of Restraint&lt;/span&gt; - creates an unresistable gale of wind that stalls an advancing opponent, slowing its forward movement by 30% for 3 tics.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Vessel of Preservation&lt;/span&gt; - binds the targeted corpse into a gem which is placed on the beneficiary's cursor, which can be stored in inventory. Gem remains intact with rez timer suspended until the person leaves the zone or is succored. Reagent 1 imbued emerald.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Nature's Essence&lt;/span&gt; - creates a sphere of natural energy which is expended when an 'outdoor' spell is cast within an 'indoor' zone. Reagent 1 imbued plains pebble.<br />

Druids _should not_ have to pay to tracksort by name / con or the cost should be very minimal.<br />
<br />
Tracksort by distance would be a new increased ability whereas tracksort by name or con is just an automated reordering of the information already available (ie less of a pain in the ass to use).<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Similarly, I love the idea of a druid AA horse, but it really would agrivate me, though I am admittedly an old and to some degree bitter druid.  As the original kings/queens of movement along with bards and shamans, I feel druids got a wee bit of a shaft with the whole &quot;horse thing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'd love that idea, I've long wanted a post 60 version of Natureskin.<br />
<br />
I'd also like a group strength spell.  Call it Might of the Forest if you want. Just something so I don't have to keep single target strengthing all the tanks.</div></div><hr />

I really like Oakskin in concept...<br />

Preference would be to have it be a 400hp buff that goes in the Focus line (letting us do respectable hp buffing on our own, and have a spell that actually stacks on raids and in groups with clerics).</div></div><hr />

<br />
A. Having them stack with PoTG/PoTC (duh).<br />
<br />
B. Give an AoE effect around them for a new higher level treeform.  As you get closer to the druid maybe you get 10hp/tick 4 mana/tick 20 ATK 10 STR or something like that and as you move out farther the stats go down a bit... I think this would improve our groupability.  Of course the offest to these benefits is the root and less FR.  I think this idea is really neat and I would like to see something done with this line of spells.  As it is it's been months since I memmed one.<br />
<br />
On another note, SoC and scale of wolf are worthless in their current form.  Make them useful.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  They've wedged themselves into a corner the way I see it.  Either they have to give druids a useful summonable pet or put DC pets everywhere or druids are at a significant disadvantage.  You can't claim druids are balanced against, say, enchanters or necros in the situation where each has a DC pet, and then claim the same when the druid has a fricken bearpet out and the necro has monk pet from hell (literally!) and the enchanter has supersword pet or far more likely some charmed beast with (puts pinky to mouth) 8 TrILLion DPS.</div></div><hr />

Allows the caster to Dire Charm up to a level 51 npc <br />
<br />
this would bring DC in line with the level increases in PoP and make DC almost usable again.</div></div><hr />

Affliction Mastery - decrease mana use for DoTs by 5, 10, 25%, can train at 61st, 63rd, 65th. <br />

As a Necromancer I would love to see some AA's created towards improving DoTs but this one would cause some problems.  It would have to be coded to not work with SCM.  Think about having SCM III, AM III and a DoT mana reduction foci, DoTs would become next to free.<br />
<br />
The DoT critical is something Necromancers have been kicking around for a while.  With the new DoT damage foci upon test (for those of you that have not heard it increases the damage of the DoT per tick instead of extending the duration) SoE now has a working method to dynamically modify a DoTs damage per tick, so critical DoTs should not be that much harder to implement.<br />

Either they have to give druids a useful summonable pet or put DC pets everywhere or druids are at a significant disadvantage. <br />

<br />
Why, it is not like Druids have ever been defined as a &quot;pet class&quot;.  So why do you feel you should have access to an equally powerfull pet?  That is like saying Necromancers need a healing upgrade because Druids got a verison of CH.  Necromaners are not a healing class, just like Druids are not a pet class.<br />
<br />
You guys have some good ideas for spells though.<br />

The fact that booboo was (and still is to some extent) a rare spell to find. I would like to see it more useful or give us some more mobs to DC.  I also like the idea of being able to DC higher level animals thru aa</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Long duration SoW... Since the dungeons are suppost to be 'doable' in an hour or 2... I would like to see a version of SoW that will last that long.<br />
<br />
2) sSoW - indoor sow.  faster then run3...  <br />
<br />
Remeber.. .No need to worry about trains!  So all our speed spells SHOULD work inside them!  <br />
<br />
So... my idea.<br />
<br />
No new spells for druids... But make all their outdoor only spells work inside!</div></div><hr />

I agree we are not a summoned pet class. We are, obviously, a charmed pet class. I don't think it's unfair to ask   for targets for our animal charms, and Dire Charms.<br />
<br />
Similarly, I could understand a Cleric or Necro wanting more undead in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we (the druid community) asked for a bear to follow us around for atmosphere...for roleplaying effect...as a babe magnet.   &quot;The nature priest has a little baby bear following him around...how cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Boo Boo was NEVER meant to be functional or useful or significant.  He was a toy.  The fact that we have found some functional use for him at times is pure lagniappe.<br />
<br />
I have seen statements by Verant/SoE folks in the last year or two to the effect that they wished the spell had never been added because druids keep asking for Boo Boo to be improved to become useful, which is contrary to the original intent of the spell.   I suspect that if druids ever really pushed for improvements to Boo Boo, the spell will just be removed entirely.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest that we just leave Boo Boo as he is, and focus any efforts on improving druids to something that won't open us to charges of wanting a mile after getting an inch.</div></div><hr />

You don't wanna go there... our sword animations max out around 27 dps on pre-luclin mobs (read zero AC mobs) thats our 62 pet, which had its ability to shield us, flurry, ramp etc.. removed so as to not be on line with other pet casters.<br />
<br />
This looks like an underground expansion, I wouldnt expect to many things flagged animal, maybe some more scaled wolfs...<br />
<br />
Charmable mobs maybe, but we will see, I suspect that this expansion will follow luclin more then pop, HIGH HPs, med DPS, High AC.</div></div><hr />
