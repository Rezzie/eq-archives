<br />
I was so amazed and flabbergasted when it dropped i went a little mental on skype!<br />
<br />
Not sure of the drop rate but in all honesty we've not had to run it that many times and i reckon the guildies got fed up with me saying lets run sethhek for 'my' druid mount ;) <br />
<br />
But when it dropped the lovely people all passed and let me take it :grin: <br />
<br />
So now we'll start running it some more to see which of them can get it next......they all reckon its a kewl shammy/priest/mage etc mount!<br />
<br />
I will say that on our server i have seen only 1 person with it and he was another druid.</div></div><hr />

It's a 0.9% drop and is among the rarest items you can have in WoW.  You will be among only a handful of people on your server to have it.<br />
<br />
I have to admit I'm a little jealous.  :p  I've run Sethekk dozens of times and seen it drop twice.  The first time I passed for a friend who now no longer plays WoW, and the second time we had tagged in a random resto druid for the bird boss only, so that she could complete her Swift Flight Form questline.  The mount dropped and she rolled need and won it.  I have detailed loot information switched on and if she had passed as one might reasonably expect the bird would have gone to me... :p  Oh well.<br />
<br />
Enjoy :&gt;<br />

<br />
i've been going on about it a lot calling it a 'druid' mount as they cant get it without me ;)<br />
<br />
but i did not expect them to pass for me and was well chuffed that they did.<br />
<br />
its what makes the game for me - the people you get to know and trust etc when playing in a grp/guild.<br />
<br />
i guess tbh we've only running Sethekk about a dozen times so we were very lucky.<br />
<br />
how many more will it take for it to drop again for someone !<br />
<br />
sorry to hear you lost it to a random druid you were helping out on her epic flight form quest :(<br />
<br />
Now i am planning to stand around in Og and Shatt on this mount and with my panda out......combined they must have a 0.5% or less chance rate as i've never ever seen anyone else on my server with the Panda and continually get asked about where to get it from !</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Anyone know if they are going to keep that in the game after 70?  I know blizz said they are taking the bear mount off the loot tables with wotlk so that ppl don't go farm it easily at 80.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-21-2008, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats a shame if they are removing the bear mount but in some way i guess you can understand it with people levelling to 80 and going on easy farm mode.</div></div><hr />

I think the only Auchindoun instance I've ran more than once was Shadow Labs. Never even been to Mana Tombs or Crypts. Groups just don't want to do them.</div></div><hr />

SL was popular when you needed the key fragment.  But getting LC rep is a royal PITA now.  Though I could probably run hSH if I were to beg in LFG.  As everyone wants a chance at the bird mount and it is a fairly easy instance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-22-2008, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i have to admit i've been to SL 1 time only in total on a normal run. and AC/MT 1/2 times each max.<br />
<br />
the only one i run is Sethhek and have only started running it on heroic for the mount and the rep as still only a third of the way to exalted.<br />
<br />
MT/AC are always popular if they are the daily heroic mind u....</div></div><hr />
