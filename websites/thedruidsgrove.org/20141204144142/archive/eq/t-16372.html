 SAN DIEGO, CA  – November 13, 2007 – Sony Online  Entertainment LLC (SOE) announces today that both EverQuest&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and EverQuest&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; II MMORPGs have  brand new expansion packs set to go on sale today throughout North America.  EverQuest Secrets of Faydwer™ and EverQuest II Rise of Kunark™ are  complete and inclusive including all previous expansions and relevant adventure  packs in each, for a suggested retail price of $39.99 at participating retail  stores and via digital download at www.station.com (http://www.station.com/).<br />
  <br />
 “Launching dual expansions of this magnitude for two  major MMOs on the same day is a Herculean feat,” said Russ Shanks, COO and Vice  President, Sony Online Entertainment. “It took a full year, dedicated  development teams and the experienced infrastructure of SOE to be able to  support these simultaneous launches.   We’re extremely proud of the breadth of the new adventures these two  games offer and we’re also grateful for the support from our beta testers and  loyal community for their input on the final products.”<br />
  <br />
 EverQuest II  Rise of Kunark brings back the  legendary high-fantasy game play style from its famous predecessor and blends it  with the beautiful cinematic graphics for which the game has become known.  “This is a return to nostalgia expansion  -- where players will enjoy the best game experience in EQII’s three year history and likely the  most compelling content the franchise has ever seen,” according to Scott  Hartsman, Sr. Producer, Sony Online Entertainment.<br />
  <br />
 Rise of  Kunark introduces players to the  Sarnak, a new dragon-like humanoid playable race that inhabits the jungle  islands of Timorous Deep - a new starting location for adventurers featuring a  wealth of new content for levels 1-20. Many of the expansion’s new zones are  based on favorite gameplay areas from the original EverQuest, such as Karnor’s Castle, the  Lake of  Ill Omen, Sebilis and  Veeshan’s Peak. In addition, Kunark raises the level cap to 80, adding new solo,  group, and raid content for levels 65-80.<br />
  <br />
 EverQuest  Secrets of Faydwer is the  fourteenth expansion for this genre-defining game. “We put a renewed emphasis on  the test and adjust period for Secrets of  Faydwer and increased the number of our Beta testers by 25 percent,” said  Clint Worley, Sr. Producer, Sony Online Entertainment.  “The feedback we received from the  players was outstanding and it raised the quality bar  exponentially.”<br />
  <br />
 Secrets of  Faydwer players will have the  opportunity to advance to level 80 as they explore through 15 new zones,  discovering thousands of new items along the way.  In addition to the new high level raid  content, there are new Alternate Advancement ability lines to refresh even the  most hardened warriors.<br />
  <br />
 Both retail and digital customers will receive several  items with their purchase. Rise of  Kunark consumers receive the base EQII game, the Rise of Kunark expansion, all three  previous expansions and adventure packs,a claimable cockatrice house pet and a Legends of Norrath online strategy game  starter pack, booster pack and loot item.   Secrets of Faydwer consumers  will receive the base EverQuest game  and all 14 expansions, a claimable worg mount and a Legends of Norrath online strategy game  starter pack, booster pack and loot item.  <br />
