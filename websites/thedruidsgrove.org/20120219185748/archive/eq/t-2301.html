<br />
People usually say that druids are rich and they have a lot of money.<br />
<br />
I'm a druid, but I'm not rich at all. I'm lucky if I can amount more that 3-4 kpps, and normally my bank account is with only 1 or 2 kpps :(  <br />
<br />
I dont know if people lie or if I'm doing things wrong because I consider I'm poor compared with almost everyone.<br />
<br />
So my question is: Is any good cash-farming camp for druids out of there, or just normal camps???<br />
<br />
Now I hunt in PoN, doing ravenous nightstalkers camp, or charming a blood raven and throwing it to trash mobs to getting some exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I appretiate any suggestion/help.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot ;)  <br />
<br />
PD.- I accept any suggestion about my equipment too, you can check it below.<br />

I made a bomb (compared to what I normally got) farming a well known pelt off some animal in a velious zone... :p <br />
These animals are blue to 60, drop PP also, and are quite easy to rot. It only takes a couple WD, Epic, and DoD bracer/arms.<br />
Pelts sell for 500pp on BB (although the price has been dropping lately) and they sell really well. I don't have them for sale for more than a couple days before someone comes along and buys them all :)</div></div><hr />

Best route to riches is to go to a zone that drops loot with a group, and get a camp.  In this day and age there are still a lot of Kunark/Velious dorps that peoplle will pay for and that no one in your group wll need.<br />
<br />
For a while I told myself I would make sure I made 1k per day by going to some greenie zone and AoEing for it but I just couldn't bring myself to stick to it.  <br />
<br />
/sigh my new drogmor is going to be a long wait...38k is a long way from 100k!</div></div><hr />
