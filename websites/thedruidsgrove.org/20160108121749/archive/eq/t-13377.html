Quest:  Tree Heaven<br />
Zone:  The Elddar Forest<br />
Quest Giver:  Speaker Grayleaf  (north of Zone in, along cliff on forest floor)<br />
<br />
Quest Text:<br />
You say, &quot;Hail, Speaker Grayleaf&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaker Grayleaf says 'A [curse] is settling in these woods.  Nothing can be done to stop this.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaker Grayleaf says 'Although it has not yet come to pass, I have heard of this curse whispered by the wind and the river.  Our roots are too deep to leave.  I understand you are from another time?  Maybe you will be able to give our spirits [rest] after these woods are enveloped by sand.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'rest?'<br />
<br />
Speaker Grayleaf says 'Good luck, Tryon.  Here is what must be done.'<br />
<br />
You are given 2 missions to choose from.  One of them is &quot;Tree Heaven&quot;<br />
<br />
Speaker Grayleaf says, 'Our spirits must be returned to the source.  Take these seeds to the Dryad of Tunare in the Plane of Growth.  She lives high in the ancient tree that towers above the rest.  Look for it in the Northeast.  She will reward you for your journey.'<br />
<br />
You are given Pouch of Treant Spirit Seeds.<br />
<br />
If you are not KOS, travel to the Plane of Growth and give the seeds to Dryad of Tunare who on the outside rim of the platform where Tunare is.  Hopefully you have not ruined your faction for PoG.<br />
<br />
Dryad of Tunare gives you Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters.<br />
<br />
Reward:  Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters<br />
<br />
I was a level 70 druid when doing this quest.  I was amiable in Plane of Growth.</div></div><hr />

Did it with my dark elf Innoruuk worshiping cleric, and my partner with his Solusek Ro worshipping wizard.  Apparently, Tunare's buddies don't care all that much for the Burning Prince.  Odd that.  After all, Solusek Ro is neutral aligned.  Guess Tunare subscribes to &quot;if you're not with us, you're against us.&quot;<br />
<br />
It just takes a bit of caution, and a ... steady hand.  We camo'd and ran to the hill by Tunare's tree (avoiding see through mobs), then up the hill for height.  High enough, and you are on the same level as the Dryad of Tunare.  Then it's a quick run across the air to the Dryad while aggroing the see through tranquil treants below.  There was plenty of time for the dark elf to do the turn in and get back to the group for the port out. <br />
<br />
The first time we tried this, my dark elf got aggro standing at the base of the hill while I was conning the treants.  So, I succored us out to Ro.  We sorta had a lack of communication :wink:  My partner was going to kite if we got aggro, I was going to succor us out.  <br />
<br />
The second time we ran to the tree, the dark elf got aggro before we got to the hill.  I recast Camo automatically, then realized that made me KOS too.  If I'd been thinking, the dark elf would have had some camo potions.  But, she only tags along after me, so I've never bought her any.<br />
<br />
We had enough time for me to get her to the Dryad, back to the group, and port out.  Of course, she had a nice train following her, and I had the protectors on me by then.  They tried, but failed miserably to prevent me from porting :wink:</div></div><hr />
