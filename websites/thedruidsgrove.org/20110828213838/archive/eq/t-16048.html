<br />
I am looking for some decent solo quests to do to gear myself back up.  I have been back playing for hmm maybe 6 or 8 weeks not sure.  I have made a lot of progress, particularly on some AA and some gear quests.  But I am kind of coming up blank for stuff I can do right now solo.<br />
<br />
I am unguilded and will probably stay that way for the time being anyway, so raid gear is out.  No pick up raids either ... I only play an hour or three at a shot.<br />
<br />
In a few levels I will do the bracer quest from Valdeholm for both bracers, and I already have a Serp Spine BP pattern in my bank waiting for me to hit level 71.  I also have items for some of the GOD quests but I question whether grinding all the faction for gear from such an old expansion is worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
What I am really looking for is a decent pants quest I can do solo.  Any ideas?  I can't seem to find anything useful in Alla...some decent dropped items I could get but hard to focus.<br />
<br />
Also, looking to update my back item in near term.  I have three possible quest items in my list but would welcome suggestions.  One is the broken sword one in WOS (have most pieces but again need buttloads of faction).  Another is the quest from the steppes involving the drop from Vergalid.  I can't recall the third option.  But back slot is probably technically my worst item.<br />
<br />
Looks like a lot of good quests are 71 plus or 75 only, so I am looking for some stuff to tide me over in the interim, as well as some fun quests to do to break up the monotony of soloing.  I group when I can but don't always have time to make it worthwhile.<br />
