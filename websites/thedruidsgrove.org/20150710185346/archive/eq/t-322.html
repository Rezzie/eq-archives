They looked something like this:<br />

-2500 -- Scowling<br />

-1000 --  Dubious<br />
   500 --  Apprehensive<br />

To Answer Panamah's first question... I think that it depends on the INDIVDUAL faction...  One faction &quot;Fairy Guard&quot; may have Dubious from -1 to -400, and &quot;Kromzek Guard&quot; may have Dubious from -1 to -10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure on the exact numbers for faction levels, though.  I think it varies some by faction - I have max faction with Iksar guards, and this only gives me indifferent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to check this yourself, do quests such as Muffins for Pandos.<br />
<br />
Also, if merchants are threatingly or scowl they are automatically set to dubious. If you want faction with these you still need to do it from the real faction, not the modified one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, this is a little confusing. <br />
<br />
It sounds like you're saying that the default for everyone could be different....<br />
<br />
For instance, say you're a Race A and you encounter an NPC that defaults to seeing you as &quot;warmly&quot;.  You're saying it still takes 2000 postive faction hits to get to max-ally even though you started at warmly?  I figured the faction scale was absolute.  Like... Warmly = indifferent + 1000.<br />
<br />
I would think if you started at warmly you'd have a much shorter time getting to max ally.  Like... 600 positive hits or so.<br />
/em wanders away looking vewy confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fatsow99</div><div class="date">07-13-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Factions are absolute, if you are warmly you will get to ally much faster than if you start at dubious. But that doesnt mean you cant increase your faction further when your already ally.<br />
<br />
Max ally isnt a set value. Max ally means you are maxed out in ally,  that can be 1100(if you base is -900) faction or 2750(if you start warmly[ 750 ] ). <br />
<br />
Take for instance iksars, if you are a good race, you can only get up to indifferent with their home town Cabilis. Thats since you most likely started out with -2000 base faction and the most you could increase from that would be 2000. So thats -2000+2000=0 faction(ie indifferent). If you trash your cabilis faction it would bottom out at -4000(deep scowl). Ofcourse, you cant get max ally to cabilis since your faction is capped at 2000+ faction hits from base.<br />
<br />
Its just to take a look at the faction list provided. Lets say your killing undead frogs in lower guk to gain live frog faction. You start out kindly at 500 base faction. After 600 undead frog kills you will con ally to live frogs. But you can still kill more frogs to gain further faction. Max ally is when you can not get any further on that faction. In this case, max ally would be another 1400 kills which sets you set you at 2500 max faction.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, there also exists factions that has hardcoded min faction, such as most factions in shadowhaven(Threatingly), but those are the exceptions from the rule.<br />
<br />

Comprende? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, this is what confuses me.  If the scale is absolute -2000 to +2000 and  absolute 2000 is maximum, then how can you go to 2500 just because you started at 500?  Doesn't seem like it's an absolutely scale then.  Unless because you start at 500 maybe the negative end only goes to -1500?  And then the scowling end is a smaller range, meaning you can get out of scowling faster?<br />
<br />
I can understand that it's a 4000 point scale and the end points might not be max ally, might be indifferent like you mentioned with the Iksar.  I'm assuming the scowling end just grows to take up the extra room.<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;if you are warmly you will get to ally much faster than if you start at dubious&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
If Max ally is at 2000 then why would the scale go to 2500?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I know there are no hardcoded boundaries for faction.  The &quot;things I did&quot; component of faction is bounded between -2000 and +2000.  This component, added together with other factors such as race, deity, and faction spells/songs, determine your current faction.  So if your starting faction is 0 (determined by all those other factors--race, deity, etc.) then the faction range is -2000 to 2000.  If your starting faction is 500, then the faction range is -1500 to +2500.</div></div><hr />

They said that faction was stored in several seperate parts:  race / class / diety, and the hits you have taken.  So your static factions(race/class/diety) were loaded, but the &quot;stuff you have done&quot; wasn't and woushi would eat ya.  so you might only be able to modify you faction +/- 2000 but you don't really know where you start =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunariel Freespirit</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Max ally is a misleading statement. There is really no fixed limit on how high your faction can get after all modifiers are added. &lt;strong&gt;Only your personal counter is capped.&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Just like Wolf Form doesn't technically make you KoS, it just gives you a tiny -1000 modifier. :p <br />
<br />
Your faction is simply a sum of these things:<br />
&lt;strong&gt;- Personal counter.&lt;/strong&gt; Starts at 0 and is normally capped at -2000 and 2000. A few factions have different caps. Most notably Beta Neutral which is capped at 0 in both ends.<br />
&lt;strong&gt;- Modifer for Race.&lt;/strong&gt; Can be changed with wolf form and other illusions. Big penalties to opposing races and often a small bonus to the same race. Some 'sceptical' races give a small penalty to every race other than themselves. The Wolf 'race' is normally -1000 on any new faction added since EQ went live.<br />
&lt;strong&gt;- Modifer for Diety.&lt;/strong&gt; Unchangable. Most Neriak factions give around -1000 for Tunare/Karana, while Grobb used to give around -300 or so and in Oggok they have no clue who Tunare and Karana is. Cabilis gives huge penalties to any non-evil diety, including Agnostic. Used mostly to penalize opposing dieties, but gives a bonus on a few special occasions. For example Rallos Zek worshippers in Kael.<br />
&lt;strong&gt;- Modifier for Class.&lt;/strong&gt; Unchangable. Used to penalize Necromancers and Shadowknights, and to let animal factions admire Druids and Rangers. Some guilds give a small bonus to their class. (Shar Vahl guilds are generous and give almost +1000 to their respective classes.)<br />
&lt;strong&gt;- Modifiers from Items.&lt;/strong&gt; Like the faction necklace for the Shadowhaven factions.<br />
&lt;strong&gt;- Modifiers from Spells or Songs.&lt;/strong&gt; Bards and Enchanters only.<br />
<br />
If an Enchanter with a +500 racial and a +500 diety modifer, max out her counter, she will have 3000. Using a +300 faction spell on top of that with raise it to 3300.<br />
<br />
Druids are still KoS to the Iksar Shamans after maxing out that faction, so we probably get -3000 or so in total on our modifiers. If we also bottomed out our counter, it would put us at around -5000.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunariel Freespirit</div><div class="date">07-14-2003, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Ok, here's what I'm trying to do. I realize it's fraught, but if you knew you just dinged indifferent with a faction, could you depend that it's going to take you 1100 more points to get get to Ally?[/quote]Yes, that is correct. I've counted several faction ranges, and they all match with the numbers shown above.<br />
<br />
And here is how the modifiers are applied:<br />
- The Race, Diety and Class modifiers are hardcoded into the server files. These files are sacred and they prefer to mess up the game rules instead of changing them. ;) <br />
- The personal counter and worn faction items are loaded from your personal record when you enter a zone.<br />
- Swapping out faction items immediately changes your faction.<br />
- The spells and songs modifiers are added the instant they are cast/played and are removed as soon as they wear off.<br />
<br />
So those Wuoshi incidents was because the personal record hadn't been loaded yet. I've also heard that some time ago your faction was fixed at indifferent for a few seconds after zoning in. It may have been a quick fix for those problems until they could sort it out better.<br />
<br />

If you just &quot;dinged&quot;  indifferent you could always depend on 1100 faction hits to get ally. Could also depend on 751 negative hits to get to Scowl.<br />
<br />
And as mentioned before, factions are based on several modifiers, such as race(can change this with illusions), deity, faction item, spells and what you have done to gain faction.</div></div><hr />
