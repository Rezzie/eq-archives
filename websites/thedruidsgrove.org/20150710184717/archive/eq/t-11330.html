I am pleased with the Wolf form but do not know where it is a no,no because of KOS... I appreciate your help. (May your Spells,Mind &amp; your Weapon be &quot;EverSharp&quot;!)

Cities that will be kos to you off the top of my head include Halas and FV.<br />
<br />
As for random zones that it makes you kos in, I don't have a very good knowledge, as I seem to be kos to everything anyway. :)   The only thing I can think of are the frogs in PoV, who are only kos if you're in wolf form.<br />
 <br />
As a side note, wolf form helps faction sometimes.  I went from threatening to dubious with the ogres in feerrott.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">05-13-2005, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wolf form reduces your faction by 2 steps in Velious cities, so don't use it there unless the guards con warmly or above.  Iirc, wolf form is KoS in all Luclin cities. Other than the frogs in PoV, I don't think wolf form changes your faction in PoP zones (you will be KoS in most of these zones anyway). Wolf form does not change faction in LoY zones (you are always KoS there).  I don't remember using wolf form in GoD, OOW, or DoN zones.   <br />
<br />
Special note: Never use wolf form in Dragon Necropolis.</div></div><hr />

And I think that's pretty much true for guards in any Luclin zone.</div></div><hr />

NonKOS also to bears, wolves, and cats (Druid, Beastlord, Ranger nonKOS, all others are KOS), but KOS to frogs in Nedaria's Landing (20-45).</div></div><hr />

Course that does no good if they are already a whalleing an a whommpin on your head. <br />
<br />
I agree with the Plane of Justice (POJ) comment.  Wolf form there brings on the mobs like you would not believe.  Woooo some bringing back some bad flashbacks.  Rats RATS RATS RATS arrrrrrrgggahahhhhhhhhh</div></div><hr />
