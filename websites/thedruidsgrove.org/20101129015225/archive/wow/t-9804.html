Anyone using one of these with WoW?  If so, do you know if it lets you directly bind the extra keys?<br />
<br />
Thinking of getting one, but curious about that.</div></div><hr />

We were both using the same keyboard before, the Saitek Eclipse (http://www.saitekusa.com/usa/prod/eclipse.htm). Both of us play in the dark, so the backlighting was the selling point. However, some keys were not illuminated as well as others, especially the horizontal num row. This keyboard has solved the lighting issue according to my friend. He plays WoW infrequently, so hasn't had a chance to try out the macro keys. I'll update once he does. Course I asked my girfriend to get me one for my birthday next month, so hopefully I can write my own review :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my understanding, they just mimic keys. Okay, I can get that. Is there a way to mimic international keys? So in theory can you use internaltional characters  in the macrs while using en-US for your standard keyboard?<br />
<br />
The only reason I hadn't gotten this keyboard yet is it's not ergo. I can't type extensively on a normal keyboard anymore. I need ergo. The above mentioned idea would be the only thing that'll make me bite to cake and use the keyboard.<br />
<br />
PS: FYI, Playing in the dark is extremely bad for your eyes.</div></div><hr />

My current keyboard seems to be dieing on me, so I need a new one. Unless I can find a decent ergo keyboard, I'll be getting this one.</div></div><hr />

I just did it as I couldn't find the functionality and ergo in  my price range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">01-02-2006, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MS has an Elite keyboard which is nice and around $60. It's doing well, and it's an ergo. MS Natural Egro Keyboard 4000. MS is the only company, these days, making Ergo keyboards. :(<br />
<br />
I might still get he G15  jus to test out the macro stuff, but in all honestly, I just love the ergo, it'll be hard for me to switch back (mentally, not physically).<br />
<br />
Oh and I know it's not hard to switch back, I have to use normal keyboards at work daily. Doesn't mean I can't love the ergo more. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">02-12-2006, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bought one of these.  Slightly large (especially in width), but good key response.  Has mute, backlight, volume keys as well as music player type keys for Winamp etc.  Standard key layout for the normal 104 keys, plus a switch on the keyboard to disable the Windows key, the 18 G-keys (with 3 banks, so 54 total), and 2 USB ports.<br />
<br />
For the LCD, most games don't come with support for it, but it has built in options to show the time, date, CPU and memory usage, or show what song you're currently playing in Winamp, iTunes, etc.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten to do much with the G-keys yet, will have to try those out and see how they work.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm pretty impressed so far.</div></div><hr />
