 <br />
While I consider myself mostly a rogue at heart, haha, I've found myself playing my druid more and more, after taking a year off of EQ, I've come back to play in the last couple months.  I have all the expansions, but really haven't done much outside of PoP, it's an easier zone than GoD/Omens to xp in with my ragtag group of botted toons (rogue/cleric/druid).  <br />
 <br />
Initially, the druid was intended as a buff/pl/taxi bot, but after playing a limited utility, heavily group dependent class for 5 years now, I'm having a blast with the druid...they can do pretty much anything if you learn to play them (which I still am, haha, I have no illusions of my skill...yet).<br />
 <br />
I don't raid with the druid, mostly either solo when I can't find a group, or 3 box him with my cleric and rogue.  His gear is mostly default, tier one/two PoP, but I'm willing to work a little to upgrade, especially if the 3 boxed toons can all get decent xp/drops in the process.<br />
 <br />
So I guess my question is this...what can I buy in bazaar/quest fairly easily/3 box or group to farm?  His gear is ok, but there's really nothing spectacular, and I'd like to make him a little more viable in a harder xp situation.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

 <br />
If you didn't multiple box but group some DoD missions will be a good choice too the gear there only miss some AC or secondary effects</div></div><hr />
