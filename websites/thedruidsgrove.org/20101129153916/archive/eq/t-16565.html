 Well, it's official, ladies and gentlemen. Believe it or not, Rep. Ron Paul, the 72-year-old Texan who hardly ever gets mentioned in Republican political news and the one-time libertarian who always gets the least time on TV debates if he isn't barred completely, was, in fact, the most successful Republican fund raiser in the last three months of 2007.<br />
<br />
By a Texas mile.<br />
<br />
 Paul, who's done well in some symbolic straw polls and little-noticed state caucuses until his best showing so far as a second-place finisher to Romney in the Nevada caucuses, has repeatedly disavowed a third-party effort if his bid to be the Republican nominee in St. Paul next summer falls short. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 You didn't hear much about the 2nd place finish here. In fact they lied and said he got third (http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Nevada_ABC_News_Lies_About_Ron_Paul_s_2nd_Place_Fi  nish/).<br />

<br />
The fact that the nearly 500 provisional ballots that were forced to be cast could have changed the outcome of the election in favor of Ron Paul and the extension for the filing of delegates at the last minute leads one to believe that the Louisiana GOP has deliberately stolen a win from Congressman Paul. - Source (http://theiceblog.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/louisiana-caucus-ron-paul-win/)<br />
<br />
 Some rules were changed and/or rearranged so that pre-approved Paul delegates had to file provisional ballots which might not have been counted at all.  The campaign is saying that the actions of the Louisiana GOP may have skewed the results of the vote, which Paul may have won.  You have to read it for yourself and make sure to keep tabs on what is happening.<br />
<br />
 As it becomes more clear that the Ron Paul Revolution is doing well, finishing 2nd place in Nevada and perhaps 1st in Louisiana, old media seems to be ramping up the effort to marginalize Paul.  At the most recent debate, Ron received less than 1/3 of the talk time of any of the media-approved candidates.  Ron Paul has repeatedly beaten Giuliani in the primaries.  He has also beaten Huckabee, Romney and McCain in recent states. -Source (http://www.ballsnews.com/paul-campaign-challenges-louisiana-gop-and-more.html)<br />
<br />
 &quot;It appears that Ron Paul supporters outnumbered the supporters of any of his opponents. But since this was predicted, the supporters of Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee, John McCain, and Mitt Romney, cooperated to set up a “fusion” slate of unpledged candidates for Delegate. The “fusion” slate, labeled the “Pro-Life/Pro-Family” slate, beat the Ron Paul slate in each of the 7 U.S. House districts. Formally, the “fusion” slate billed itself as an “uncommitted” slate, and no one really knows how many supporters of each presidential candidate are on the fusion slate, except the campaigns themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
 ...<br />
<br />
 &quot;It says “UPDATE. We just got word that Ron Paul won Tuesday’s Louisiana caucus.”<br />
<br />
He did. He beat all “candidates”. The pro family slate is not a candidate.<br />
<br />
If anyone does a search online they will not find any other candidate that beat him.&quot; -Source (http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/01/23/louisiana-republican-caucus/)</div></div><hr />

Statements made by Ron Paul:<br />
<br />
-On the Los Angeles riots- &quot;Order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks three days after rioting began. ... What if the checks had never arrived? No doubt the blacks would have fully privatized the welfare state through continued looting. But they were paid off and the violence subsided.&quot; <br />
<br />
-Praise for David Duke- Duke &#8220;Scared the blazes out of the establishment&#8221; <br />
<br />
-Remarks on Martin Luther King- This newsletter describes Martin Luther King Jr. as &quot;a world-class adulterer&quot; who &quot;seduced underage girls and boys&#8221;. <br />
<br />
-Israel- The March 1987 issue of The Ron Paul Investment Letter calls Israel &quot;an aggressive, national socialist state.&quot;<br />
<br />
sounds less EVOLutionary and more DEVOLutionary.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not even close to left wing, but one has to acknowledge that both parties need to appeal to moderates on both sides of the political parties.  You can't do that with this sort of person.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">02-16-2008, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">14% of American drug users are black.  ~30% of people arrested for drug-related charges are black.  ~65% of people who are in jail for drug related charges are black.<br />
<br />
Clearly a man who is well aware of this fact, and wants to pardon every non-violent drug offender, is a racist.<br />
<br />
But hey, Mitt John Rudy and Fred skipped the black debate, clearly Ron is the racist of the party because of some things he may or may not have said 20 yrs ago.</div></div><hr />
