<br />
What is the best weapon enchant for feral cat dps?<br />
Also is strength still the best for cats?<br />
I need to gem some cat gear I got last night.<br />
<br />
Hate to ask a newbie question but I've always been a feral tank and very rarely I go cat.<br />
<br />
I have the 2hd mace from naxx and the feral staff from naxx both dps and also the tank staff from naxx.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
From what I've read, in 3.1 agi == str.  With a very slight edge to agi.  Though that edge might be a bit less now that rake will no longer crit from Primal Gore (new talent).</div></div><hr />

@Kheldar<br />
Grats on your afternoon :-D<br />
<br />
About the staff-enchant:<br />
For DPS 110 AP or Berserk<br />
For Tank = Mongoose</div></div><hr />

I guess after the nerf they are probably almost equal.  Not 100% sure - but agility lets you tank in the said item as well.</div></div><hr />

Slightly over 110 AP in DPS.<br />
But the costs of berserk are much higher, so i have the 110 AP.<br />
<br />
Right now i dont know if a Rip started with Berserk can be refreshed without the proc. (or maybe the message &quot;A mor powerful spell is active&quot;).<br />
This problem will be gone in 3.1 cause we dont get a AP modifier from SR anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beserk if you never plan to use the weapon as a tank ever though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-16-2009, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beserk costs ~400 armor when it procs.  Mongoose is still king for tanking, but don't worry about the &quot;armor loss&quot; of beserk its less than the armor on the OoN.  So go Beserk over Massacre/110AP.</div></div><hr />

I did the same thing, but then got my OoN and Used my Undeath Carrier as a DPS staff.  Strapped Beserk on it and just watched my character screen while beating a dummy!  I was really testing to see how often it proc'd but the armor lost is laughable.</div></div><hr />

Had a guildy get the &quot;Blood Reserve&quot; pattern out of Uldaur yesterday.  Anyone tried this yet?  Its more of a tanking thing, but I am wondering if anyone has tried it yet, and if its worth it.  I am so sick of putting Mongoose on everything!</div></div><hr />
