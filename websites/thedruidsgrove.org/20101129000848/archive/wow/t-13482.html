<br />
Any quick link to a 10 man raiding spec....as i posted some months ago i have never bothered with eclipse as for heroics it seems less than ideal on mobs that have relatively little health and you cannot control the proc.<br />
<br />
With raiding i guess I really need to spec into it but i'm loathe to lose my boosted AOE via gale winds etc.  I also feel OoC is a must have but atm i do not have the mana reduction talent for shapeshifting (and obviously not Master Shapeshifter) instead i use the mana regen talent in the resto tree....Intensity ?<br />
<br />
Is iIS needed for raiding ?<br />
<br />
To get the talents I want i believe i am going to have to drop some of the mana regen talents in the oomkin tree ?<br />
<br />
Do I need Improved Moonkin Form due to the haste benefit ? (to me and grp members ?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While raiding your improved moonfire isn't so vital, it can free you 2 pt to put into eclipse.<br />
<br />
For mana regen talent it will depand of what class you can have acces in your raid. Paladin and shaman buffs and class with will make your mana saving talent less usefull as you will not go oom.<br />
<br />
For a perfect talents seclection for raiding don't look at mine as I am mostly an healer while raiding (that must be able to heal tank often) and my dps selection is mostly for aoe soloing.<br />

<br />
i will look at a potential new spec.<br />
<br />
when raiding we have a pally and shammy 99% of the time !<br />
<br />
so maybe i dont need all the mana talents.  just the haste ones ?</div></div><hr />
