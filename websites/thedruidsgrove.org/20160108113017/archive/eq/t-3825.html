<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll shove this over to the AA board in a bit, but since not everyone who may be interested reads that board, I'll toss it up here for starters.<br />
<br />
Made 350 AA this morning, and had points saved up so I stuck 15 in stamina.   Below are the increase in HP per stamina point.  I already had the HP booster AA (hell, I have pretty much everything at this point, really), so keep that in mind with regard to the numbers below.   I had my cha outfit on, which allowed me to bracket 3000 hp nicely for the sake of comparison.<br />
<br />
STA - HP<br />
<br />
170 - 2951<br />
172 - 2959<br />
174 - 2966<br />
176 - 2973<br />
178 - 2980<br />
180 - 2988<br />
182 - 2994<br />
184 - 3002<br />
186 - 3008<br />
188 - 3016<br />
190 - 3023<br />
192 - 3030<br />
194 - 3037<br />
196 - 3045<br />
198 - 3051<br />
200 - 3059<br />
<br />
So, 15 AA in sta gets you 108 hp.  How much would you pay for an item with 108 hp that didn't take up an equipment slot?   Whether it's worth it to you depends on how many AA you have, of course.  <br />
<br />
BTW, I also bought the improved exodus recast time skill.   It was 2/2/2.  Just in case anyone was wondering...:)</div></div><hr />

While I think this is cool and all, I really think improved mgb recast time would have a better design. Oh well. =)<br />

100hps for 15 aa's. Not for someone just starting out, certainly, but heck if you've got 350, I'm sure you got metabolism and better breathing too...not much else to get that's worth anything. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something I really need to check is what a druids Stamina/point is post 255. . .then we would be able to better determine if raising our stamina cap (and stamina) through aas is worth it.<br />

If you plug that into Excel you can manipulate it easily to experiment with various sta levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">02-18-2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, buffs from other classes can easily kick you over the cap.  I'm like that with wisdom and any form of KEI+, and now with stamina (since my raiding base stamina is a bit higher than the numbers above after I swap equipment).   However, I don't travel with a shaman in my backpocket, and most of my time is spent soloing at the moment (you don't get AA like that from raiding!), so I usually don't have a shaman buff on.   I like being as self-sufficient as possible (although I hate to be without KEI+).<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;While I think this is cool and all, I really think improved mgb recast time would have a better design&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Absolutely!   I'd pay 10/10/10 for a improved MGB skill!</div></div><hr />
