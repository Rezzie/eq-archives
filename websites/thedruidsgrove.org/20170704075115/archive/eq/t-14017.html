I think I climbed one of the big tree's a bit until the z axis cut me off. Wolf form was some interesting abilities to run up things with... just not up and over that part sucked. I tried to climb Tower of Frozen Shadows so many times.... on last hump would have put me at the tip top assuming z axis didn't cut off.... I thought there might have been a zone in on top of it, because it looks like something could be up there. And plane of knowledge library was fun to try and climb.. use wolf form at points to get up some of it... I think at one more of the humps I could have used treeform to have someone run up me to further get up the tower. Did make some interesting screenies though, with the fuzziness of the outside zone boundries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This goes WAY back, probably fall of 2000.  I had just started playing EQ, and was probably in my teens at the time.  There was a BotB server qualifier happening at the Arena one evening, so I decided to go see a new zone, and check out the action.  Nobody was there yet when I arrived, so I climbed up to the top of one of those giant spires that was there.  Then I set my camera angle down towards the arena floor, and started reading a book, occasionally checking the screen to see when the action started.<br />
<br />
Well, quite a while went by, and I was seeing plenty of zone chat, but no action.  More time goes by, and still no action.  So I type an ooc asking when it would start, and several people state that it's almost over.  WTH?!!?!<br />
<br />
So I float down, and see all kinds of toons around, and then I realize what happened.  I had a lame-o PC that required lots of options turned off/down to play well.  One of these was.. the clip plane :o  So I couldn't see any people in the arena because I was too high up off the ground, LOL.<br />

<br />
In my early 30's I soloed a lot in FM, near the giant fort.  I wanted to bind nearby, so I could get back quick after banking/leaving to group/whatever.  I wanted to bind close-by, but not where I could agro anything.  I found that the VERY top of the mountain behind the fort was agro-free, so I bound up there.  It was a little tricky coming down, especially without lev on.  The first time that I popped in there after dieing (in FM, by the way), I realized I should cast lev before coming down.  Of course, I had no bat wings, because I had just died!  So I needed to port out, before I could get my corpse, in the zone I was already in!<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I rebound pretty soon after that :)<br />

You need to climb the skinwalker cocoon's silk threads to the very top, and because of how it is so steep I think it took around 3 hours to reach the top :p something around +3100 in the z axis lol.

at the relic zone in first thing you see there is some sort of building. I was hugging it on my horse and it shot me up the side....<br />

kept hugging and fiddling with it until i was on top of the entire thing and then on top of one of those pointy things......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lapdru2</div><div class="date">07-21-2006, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to solo a LOT in PoF at tables.  One day when I was at the top of the mountain that you climb before going &quot;over the wall&quot;, I discovered that my toon had actually went &quot;over&quot; the mountain instead of just climbing it.  In doing so, I could go around the entire zone outside of any mountain walls.<br />
 <br />
I soon searched the whole &quot;outer zone&quot; area and I noticed a spot near the throne room where the tile floor extended through the mountain.  I jumped down on the floor and was able to walk right through the mountain wall and was at the throne room w/o having to go over the wall or run through the field.  I liked this so much that I did it every time that the &quot;FR trigger&quot; mob wasn't up.  Of course I did go agro him from behind a couple times and drag him all the way to the throne room, then run back to tables and camp, just to mess w/ people heads.<br />
 <br />
Point to note:  If you want to go &quot;over the mountain&quot; just prior to the wall you'll need SoE and a mount.  Not sure why but extremely hard to do w/o a mount.</div></div><hr />
