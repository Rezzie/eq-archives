How hard is it to level from 70?<br />
 <br />
Any major changes in what to expect from druid or shaman?<br />
 <br />
Any good places to look over UI mods? Is there a Target of Target Mod?<br />
 <br />
Is slow still mitigated on lots of mobs?<br />
 <br />
Its amazing to think about how much I have forgotten and how much I used to be able to do.<br />
 <br />
I also cant seem to get my old druids grove password sent to my email.  Says theres still a registered person at that email but the emails never show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">12-07-2008, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Levelling is easy as long as you're either (1) good at soloing, or (2) can find people to hunt with on a regular basis.  As you get closer to level 85 you should find it easier to get pickup groups.  Use the LFG window!  When you can't find a group, try charming--specifically, charming a pet, sending it to attack another mob, breaking charm when it's low on health and then finishing it off with a nuke or two.<br />
<br />
For UI modifications, the best resource is EQInterface: http://www.eqinterface.com/downloads/index.php<br />
<br />
Slow is still mitigated on nearly all mobs, but it's quite useful anyway--just not as critical as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Our level 76+ heals and nukes have been boosted substantially, and we have several new tricks.  Our healing power has never been as close to that of a cleric as it is now.  We finally got a respectable group heal, plus an emergency group heal that only works on people that are low on health.  Level 76+ nukes have a short cast time, with a longer recast to make up for it--this allows us to alternate between nukes if we want to burn a mob down quickly.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Few more questions:<br />
1) any way to sort Augs by slot in bazaar.<br />
 <br />
2) Are AAs easier to grind at 70 or at higher levels?<br />
 <br />
3) How long does it take to get an AA roughly?<br />
 <br />
4) Any AAs you recommend?<br />
 <br />
5) Any PMs on places/thing to do for cash would be nice.  Came back so so broke lol.<br />
 <br />
6) Where is a good place for maps?<br />
 <br />
7) Where is a good place for Quest Info.<br />
 <br />
8) Is there anyway to get a countdown timer on cooldowns on the buttons/bars?<br />
 <br />
Sorry for the million questions but I reupped and man its daunting task</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">12-10-2008, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maps: http://www.mapfiend.net<br />
Quests: http://everquest.allakhazam.com, http://home.comcast.net/~mathadon/Guides/index.html, http://mobilis.wordpress.com/<br />
<br />
As for AAs being easier to grind at 70 or higher levels, it depends on finding people to hunt with.  It's hard to say.  The time needed to get an AA is going to vary significantly, but I'll go with 15-20 minutes (not counting Lesson of the Devoted) as a typical rate.  It is possible to get AAs much more quickly than this in a good group.<br />
<br />
Important AAs that you don't have: Gift of Mana, Shield Block, Quickened Radiant Cure, final rank of Healing Adept, final rank of Mnemonic Retention, additional ranks of Healing Gift and Radiant Cure, Fortified Survival (once you're level 78), Shared Camouflage, Entrap, Spirit of the White Wolf (at least the first rank).  Other recommendations might depend on play style: for example, if you find yourself charm soloing a lot, Mastery of Nature will be important.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can get the kind of countdown timers you're looking for.  However, if you click on a grayed out ability you'll typically get a message that tells you how much time is left.  Clickable items with reuse timers are displayed with a portion of the box shaded, giving you an idea of how long you have to wait (as a fraction of the total reuse time).</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Currently Im 70, and hunting in my familiar POP hunting grounds with a little walls of slaughter thrown in. <br />
 <br />
Where would some good tips be for hunting grounds at 70 in content after discord.<br />
 <br />
And in case I level a little from 70-75 range wise.<br />
 <br />
I do a lot of Root/Rotting since I 2 box my shaman so anything that doesnt summon is fairly easy.  And pulling if its outdoors and lullible is as easy as always.<br />
 <br />
Though I can charm, quad, as I shake the rust off.<br />
 <br />
Two other friends came back, a Bst/Monk so they are my usual tanks for grouping stuff.  Too bad none of us had a plate!</div></div><hr />

Look also TSS zones:  in The stepps (druid port) and Icefall Glacier<br />
<br />
Laters I would switch to SoF zones like Dragonscale Hills (via Akanon POK Stone) and Loping Planes (druid port)</div></div><hr />
