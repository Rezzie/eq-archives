<br />
that being said, i would suggest Outfitter... having used Itemrack, and loved it, when it became out-of-date a few patches ago for a good long while, i got Outfitter and never looked back... it's EXTREMELY easy to set up and use, and you can disable automatic outfit changes with 2 or 3 mouse clicks</div></div><hr />

<br />
it seemed to update itself earlier when i started to use wowmatrix and now its blanked all my gear sets:(<br />
<br />
would prefer to keep to itemrack and it does everything i need.</div></div><hr />
