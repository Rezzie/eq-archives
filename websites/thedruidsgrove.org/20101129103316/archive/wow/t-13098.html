<br />
Fortunately for me, the Wyrmcrest have some pretty decent rewards.<br />
<br />
Had I had any brains at all, I would have consciously searched for the QM's in every town I discovered while levelling.....<br />
<br />
however, I have no brains.<br />

<br />
I got Kirin Tor to Honored for the shoulders, and may champion them for a while for the Robes.<br />
<br />
Just got Wyrmrest exalted today... for belt, bracers, head enchant, sandals, but ultimately for the mount.<br />
<br />
Next comes Sons of Hodir for their shoulder inscription.<br />
<br />
My next vanity rep will be Oracles for the chance at the green protodrake mount.<br />
<br />
As far as gear goes, it's been my experience that I'll get a rep piece, then replace within a few dungeon runs with a drop or emblem piece that's better, so it really hasn't been a big deal to focus on one tabard rep over the other.<br />
<br />
QMs that I know of off the top of my head:<br />
Wyrmrest Accord - Wyrmrest temple in central Dragonblight.  Championable. But you know that one already. :-)<br />
Kirin Tor - Violet citadel, SW corner of Dalaran, second floor at the top of the stairs.  Championable.<br />
Kalua'ak - in the tuskar villages of Moaki Harbor or Kamauga.  Dailies for rep.<br />
Sons of Hodir - Lillehof, in eastern Storm Peaks. Dailies for rep.<br />
Oracles - Geen, in central Sholazar Basin. Dailies for rep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And tks for posting the QM's.  As far as I can tell, only the two provide tabards for Instance Rep?  <br />
<br />
And yes, Head Enchant and Drake from Wyrmrest..../thumbsup.</div></div><hr />

You know the funny thing... I was poking around on the PTR, and with the feral AP changes, that fishing pole gives ~1800 Feral AP in 3.0.8.  No other stats though.</div></div><hr />

I was about to say I only have 2 exalted reps, but I looked on WoWJuju.com (http://www.wowjuju.com/index.php?page=6#US_Turalyon_Rhus) and saw that I do have 3.  Wow.  I really do need to take a break. :-)  <br />
<br />
Honestly, all I've done is to follow Jame's guides for Borean Tundra, Howling Fjord and just finished Dragonblight, then did dailies for Kalua'ak and Wyrmrest faction, and a boat load of instances.<br />
<br />
According to WoWwiki, there are 4 championable reps: Kirin Tor, Wyrmrest Accord, Knights of the Ebon Blade, and Argent Crusade.  <br />
But really, the 5th is Alliance Vanguard/Horde Expedition, as those are the default reps that are gained if you do a lvl 80 dungeon/heroic with no tabard on.<br />
<br />
Apparently the Argent Crusade is based out of Icecrown, and the Knights in Icecrown or Zul'Drak.  Haven't met either QM though.<br />
<br />
Yeah,Yrys, I've taken out a couple of mobs while fishing without changing weapons, just because I could.  :)  There's nothing quite like delivering a good ol' butt kickin' using that monster of a pole.<br />
( Mastercraft Kalu'ak Fishing Pole (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44050) for the curious )</div></div><hr />

Yep, the Argent Crusade guy is at the first Base you encounter when you enter IceCrown (30secs flight from Dalaran). he's up on the top ledge with the bigboss man.<br />
<br />
The Ebon Blade QM isn't visible until you do the IceCrown quests to a point where you take over the big castly thing in the north and get the FP, she's inside by the forge on the left as you go in.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the vagueness I'm at work and can't hit any of the usual Wow sites for the proper names.</div></div><hr />

Its The Shadow Vault up in NW Icecrown for the Ebon Blade circa 36,18<br />
<br />
And The Argent Vanguard for the Argent Crusade in the SE corner circa 85,73.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a future Feral/Resto dual spec I've been focusing on Kirin Tor.  They offer 2-3 nice Feral and Resto rep items for a few slots.  I'll work on the others (for enchants??) as needed.  The one thing I like about LK factions, there doesn't seem to be one that you have to get to exalted in order to compete (a la CE rep).<br />
<br />
My only complaint about Kirin Tor rep is the only daily quests are for cooking and JC(?).  I don't have either one.  Which means I have to run dungeons to gain rep.</div></div><hr />
