http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/18/MN4916I9NP.DTLAfrica-bound pope says condoms increase AIDS<br />
<br />
(03-18) 04:00 PDT Yaounde, Cameroon --<br />
<br />
Pope Benedict XVI said condoms are not the answer to the AIDS epidemic in Africa and can make the problem worse, setting off criticism Tuesday as he began a weeklong trip to the continent where about 22 million people are living with HIV.<br />
<br />
Benedict's first statement on an issue that has divided even Catholic clergy working with AIDS patients came hours before he arrived in Cameroon's capital - greeted by thousands of flag-waving faithful who stood shoulder to shoulder in red dirt fields and jammed downtown streets for a glimpse of the pontiff's motorcade.<br />
<br />
In his four years as pope, Benedict had never directly addressed condom use, although his position is not new. His predecessor, Pope John Paul II, often said that sexual abstinence - not condoms - was the best way to prevent the spread of the disease.<br />
<br />
Benedict also said the Roman Catholic Church was at the forefront of the battle against AIDS.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can't resolve it with the distribution of condoms,&quot; the pope told reporters aboard the Alitalia plane heading to Yaounde. &quot;On the contrary, it increases the problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Catholic Church rejects the use of condoms as part of its overall teaching against artificial contraception. Senior Vatican officials have advocated fidelity in marriage and abstinence from premarital sex as key weapons in the fight against AIDS.<br />
<br />
Three-quarters of all AIDS deaths worldwide in 2007 were in sub-Saharan Africa, where some 22 million people are infected with HIV - accounting for two-thirds of the world's infections, according to UNAIDS.<br />
<br />
Africa is the fastest-growing region for the Catholic Church, though it competes with Islam and evangelical churches.That's right, the pope tries to destroy the single most effective health measure in preventing one of the deadliest epidemics in Africa, just so that he can keep himself in power.<br />
<br />
It's not enough that his followers killed many of the Africans, raped them, took all their stuff and their land, used them as slaves for generations (through even more rape), and forced them to convert to Christianity at gunpoint.  Now he wants to kill them all over again, while preaching his doublethink (&quot;I want to stop the AIDS epidemic&quot; / &quot;You can't use condoms&quot;).<br />
<br />
And the Africans themselves are so brainwashed by Christianity that they thank him for his efforts.<br />
<br />
Here in California, causing a death by acting with reckless disregard for human life is murder, and it is similar in many other states.  The pope should be charged with millions of counts of murder the minute he sets foot in this country.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pope said a responsible and moral attitude toward sex would help fight the disease, as he answered questions submitted in advance by reporters traveling on the plane. His response was presumably also prepared in advance.<br />
The Pope shouldn't ride around inside the protection of the Popemobile because it increases the risk of violence against him.  What he should do to protect himself is take a responsible and moral attitude towards assassination.  <br />

What a dimwit.</div></div><hr />

He brought back exorcism squads and all sorts of archaic methods.  I would like to ask him though, if, condoms do not help reduce the risk of infection of HIV, and doctors(as well as other medical personel) all around the world use latex gloves, the same thing as a condom, except for hands, to protect against many blood borne diseases. Yet, they do not routinely get hiv, hepatitus, and other blood borne pathogens, does that mean they should abstain for working on patients and let the big G, to the O, to the D, take care of them instead? Of course, he could cite that lady that stuck herself with ebola a week ago, but, then, those events are rare. Or are medical personel the hand of god with their miraculous healing powers?<br />
<br />
How about that priest that is refusing to grant some religeous communion for those who voted for Obama? Or another priest that is excommunicating a 12 year old girl for getting an abortion, even though she had been raped by a family member and was largely unable to currently bare children without risk of serious side effects like death, to her small 85 pound frame? While in time she may fill out to be able to bare children, just not quite yet. The comical decree that if you are not a catholic, since catholism is descended directly from the disciples and apostles under Jesus, you are not christians.<br />
<br />
Nah but, in all seriousness, I disagree with many of the catholic churches policies throughout the years. But, then they are also losing ground in the United States to agnostics and atheists slowly and surely.<br />

edit.... ehh.... image broke.</div></div><hr />

Hah!  Too funny.  I think it's inevitable that when one hears the terms &quot;Pope&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; in the same sentence that the image of condoms and/or the Popemobile come to mind.</div></div><hr />
