<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">12-08-2006, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of AC and feral charge. The pet is usually a cat anyway and does nada damage on your bearform. Having Focused Casting talent in resto helps though.. or natures swiftness/hibernate.<br />
<br />
But I generally just wear them down in bearform. Maybe pop out and throw a quick rejuv if you have mana to spare. After a while they are OOM and you are at 50%+ health and have full mana. GG mr hunter. :) Don't panic if you get stuck in the ice trap. Just stay in bear. The aimed shot that follows only does about 500ish damage or less anyway (against a tier 2-3 hunter anyway).<br />
<br />
Remember to feral charge all the time and you'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just save your bash in bearform for when you need to heal - rage isn't usually a problem against hunters...<br />
<br />
So I use Charge + Maul/Mangle + Bash - pop out and put a regrowth and rejuv on me - and back into bear..<br />
<br />
I find hunters muuuch easier now after mangle... <br />
Did a 1.3K mangle on a hunter yesterday! :D <br />
<br />
All they say now after a duel is either... &quot;omg&quot; or &quot;wtf&quot; or.... &quot;thats just lame&quot; :D</div></div><hr />

Maybe a bash to make things ever easier.</div></div><hr />
