<br />
Since Glyphs are selling cheap on my server (5-20g or so for most) I am not going to take it up as a profession.<br />
<br />
My question is this, what Glyphs are you buying/insribing, for tanking and for Kitty DPS ?<br />
<br />
I went so far with Glyph of Maul  (makes mauls hit 2 targets)<br />
and Glyph of Rip (extends the time of the bleed effect)<br />
and i want the Swipe glyph but have not found it yet (makes your swipe hit one extra target)<br />
<br />
what are your thoughts?:iamwithst</div></div><hr />

anyone using anything different?  i think i got the glyph of rake, not rip,  i just use it so bleed effects last longer for the dps gains that gives you in kitty form</div></div><hr />

<br />
the maul one looks ok though.<br />
<br />
i really need to see a list of the all the druid ones to decide on the best ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maul is hands down the best best glyph if you intend to tank at all.  Maul is the #1 threat generating attack, and the good news is, it doesn't split your damage.  <br />
<br />
For Example, my maul hits for ~750-850 normal and crits for ~1350-1700 per target!  So you effectively double your DPS with that glyph.</div></div><hr />

For tanking I like:<br />
Major:<br />
Glyph of Maul<br />
Glyph of Frenzied Regeneration<br />
<br />
Minor<br />
Glyph of Challenging Roar<br />
Glyph of Thorns<br />
Glyph of Unburden'd Rebirth<br />
<br />
For DPS<br />
Major:<br />
Glyph of Rip<br />
Glyph of Shred<br />
<br />
Minor:<br />
Glyph of Dash<br />
Glyph of Thorns<br />
Glyph of Unburdened Rebirth</div></div><hr />

<br />
for now: <br />
Glyph of Rip<br />
Glyph of Shred<br />
<br />
at 80 i'll add:<br />
Glyph of Maul<br />
<br />
for the Minor glyphs:<br />
<br />
Glyph of Unburdened Rebirth (YAY for another bag slot!)<br />
Glyph of Aquatic Form (i love the thought of getting from BS to Stabs that much faster in AB)<br />
can't decide between Glyph of Dash and Glyph of Challenging Roar for the last slot... Glyph of Dash would definitely come in handy for WSG flag running, but Glyph of Challenging Roar seems like it would come in very handy for instances...<br />
<br />
i think i'm leaning towards Glyph of Dash... there are so many times that i'll run an instance without using Challenging Roar even once, and with a new lower CD anyways, im thinking that will be sufficient</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't have to worry about that until wotlk instances :) .  Pretty much everything in the game (pre t5 / t6 stuff) can be aoe tanked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and ofc the first since i bought the maul glyph a couple days ago....<br />
<br />
<br />
arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<br />
<br />
how many times did i have to apologise for breaking a close CC cos i used maul /ashamed<br />
<br />
i cant decide if i should immediately ditch it or if its just a case of needing to get used to it and condition myself to not use maul when CC mobs are nearby as with not using swipe ?<br />
<br />
maybe i'll try it tonight as i've got a few hours spare again and may as well get another couple of the heroic achievements that i should already have !</div></div><hr />

Multi-Mob Tanking = OWNAGE^^<br />
<br />
And as for the problem with CC:<br />
Maul hits only targets in front of you (not like Swipe now).<br />
So show your butt to the CC'd mob and your fine.<br />
<br />
Did someone notice, if there are 2 mobs and 1 CC in front of you, is Maul choosing the 2 non-CC or is it random?<br />
Never watched at that.<br />
<br />
And as posted above CC is not needet until WotLK(except SW).<br />
Right now even BT is AOE-tanked^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
It definatley choses a second target at random.  It could just be the location of that second target, but it seemed without fail, as soon as I would hit maul with multiple targets and CC around me, I would break the CC.<br />
<br />
Its really not a problem if you have a proactive DPS'er, it only causes headaches when you are pinched between pulls (skipping mobs) and your CC'er is a little slow on the trigger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the moment maul is just the overkill threat generator.  I typically generate threat about 2:1 vs my DPS.  By the end of most boss fights the DPS (who actually manage their threat) are usually around 60% of what my threat is.<br />
<br />
Shammies and Pallys are on my &quot;List&quot; right now for blowing every cool down they have before mobs even get to me for positioning....grr.</div></div><hr />

The boomkin combination of the Moonfire one and the Starfire one is a very nice combo for sustained strong DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It builds tons of threat on your second target so that you have a strong hold when your DPS switches over and will also easily hold the target when your donkey DPS can't tell the difference between a &quot;skull&quot; and &quot;X&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Plus it breaks CC, but that's just a learning curve issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With so many classes having CC now, it is unlikely that you are unable to position yourself and targets to only have primary (skull) and secondary (x) in range.  <br />
<br />
Most non AoE pulls are between 2-6 mobs atm.  You can usually burn 1-2 mobs (imp, succy, pet, whatever) and then just have 2 CC'd and 2 tanked.<br />
<br />
Using H-Mgt as an example of max pulls.  I can't think of a non-raid/non-AoE pull that has more that 6 mobs...I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Maul is essentially the threat generator of choice, right after Mangle, and the damage it puts out is impressive to say the least.<br />
<br />
Yes, it takes a little adjustment to get used to.  Either your CC will need to do their bit before the pack gets to you, or you need to not use CC, or you need to not use Maul at the start of the fight -- given that you're still using your rage applying Lacerates at that point, that's not necessarily a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just somthing I thought I would try since I have been respec twice a weekend at least to get into raids.  But the Glyph of Healing touch essentially turns HT into flash heal.  <br />
<br />
The big upside to this isn't so much when I am resto spec'd (would much rather have Glyph of Rej) but when I am feral spec off healing.  I have found that feral spec off healing means you can HT heal, and every other healer lights up your target first, or HoT heal, and again, other healers seem to have the target topped off before your hot ticks twice.  <br />
<br />
The real upside to the Glyph of HT in this case is that you don't waist so many heals/mana.  While casting HT, Healbot tells the rest of the healers a heal is on the way, so they don't over heal, a weakness of HoTs is that they do not show up on Healbot (yours do, other peoples don't).  So I have found that my Feral Spec off healing is much more effective with Glyph of HT.  (its also very nice in PvP, hits for about 2k without a crit in caster gear/feral spec, definatley can keep a target up a long time spamming it)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I replaced my Glyph of FR with the HT.  The FR is nice, but I get more milage out of this one.</div></div><hr />
