And as things stand right now, our specs (spell, heal, melee, tank) are #1-#2.  So, you really can't go wrong with a druid (though cat dps requires you to track way too much stuff IMO).</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol<br />
<br />
seriously though, the grind to 80 on a druid is cake compared to other classes (if you're feral anyways) and kitty dps right now is *rawr*... i have NO problems finding a dps spot in heroics, and it's a lot of fun being able to dps and be *very* competitive on the damage meters...<br />
<br />
a little side story: i've been consistantly in the top 2 for damage done in heroics and 10 man Naxx, Vault, and OS... that's while i was sporting my level 70 S4 chestpiece and gloves! Tuesdy night I got some OS25 love, and the t7.5 gloves, and Wednesday night i got some Vault 25 love, and got my t7.5 leggings. I also went and bought the Hateful shoulders with Emblems of Valor, and bought the Savage chest with arena points and honor... so my PvP set and my PvE set got a major overhaul... I'm really looking forward to running some more 10 mans and pwning the damage meters :)</div></div><hr />

We have a feral Kitty that went from barely keeping pace with the tanks to #2 on our meters since patch.  (#2 ~ 2.8k-3.2k dps)</div></div><hr />

Not sure what spec yet tho, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-02-2009, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For leveling I would go standard Raid boomkin.  You can easily heal non-heroics this way.  <br />
<br />
Below is the spec that typically use for Boomkin.  Keep in mind Boomkin is my least played spec, so someone who plays boom full time may have a bit better insight.  <br />
<br />
Lots of people like to take &quot;Typhoon&quot; but if you have ever tanked, you will know why I simply can't reccomend it.  It is probably a decent enough DPS cast, but it is a tanking nightmare!  <br />

Yep, sorry...should have explained that better.  Once you start to raid (heroics+) you are going to have to pick a specialty.  If your financing allows, you can just respec as needed.  I find, I rarely hit a monday evening without being saved to every raid except &quot;Eye&quot;.  But my JC profits are eaten very quickly by respecs/gear maintenance.<br />
:cool:</div></div><hr />

:cool:<br />
But how , with this spec will my healing be in instances , since we can never find a healer on my server<br />
<br />
Btw my druid is Xedo on Lightbringer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-02-2009, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am confused by your quest.  &quot;but how?&quot;  <br />
<br />
how do you heal?  how do you respec?  how do you DPS?<br />
<br />
Your healing can be in instances or just in general world combat or PvP.  I was thinking you would be leveling with your wife, and you would heal her whenever needed and just DPS the rest of the time. <br />
<br />
You do not need to be spec'd Resto while leveling to heal an instance.  It will make it much much easier, but it is definatley do-able as Boomkin.</div></div><hr />

But doing so will reduce your solo DPS.</div></div><hr />
