<br />
I think that this has been covered before but I'm afraid I can't find the relevant thread :-(<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend an addon that will show the time remaining on HoTs on other players and will work with the latest patch?  I have just got swiftmend (yay!) but I'm not using it very efficiently because I can't see the HoT remaining.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />

It'll show u both the duration on ur HoTs, entangle, hibernate, demo roar and such, as well as a seperate counter for ur cooldowns. I couldnt play without tbh.<br />

DoTimer @ Curse-Gaming.com (http://wow.curse-gaming.com/en/files/details/3260/dotimer/)<br />

(dont understand why people use Natur Enemy Castbar, 1. blizzard has implemented it as standard. 2. e-castingbar not only shows u enemy casting bar but also is one of the best castingbar addons ive tried).</div></div><hr />

Sure you can see people casting spells in the standard ui but as far as I know it doesn't show you how long, for instance, is left on a mages polymorph.<br />
<br />
This is very handy if you're leading and your mage isn't that great.</div></div><hr />
