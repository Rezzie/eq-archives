<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runyarusco</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently posted this on my website (http://www.unbearably.net), but I figured it might be worth tacking up here as well, especially if anyone else has suggestions. Note that these are tanking suggestions. I am admittedly too lazy to redo all the links, but they're all here at the original post (http://www.unbearably.net/2008/10/02/so-what-am-i-not-wearing-yet-a-particularly-heroic-shopping-list/). <br />
<br />
This list only takes into account Rare or Epic quality items from Heroic dungeons, items obtainable through BoE World Drops, or BoE Leatherworking craftables. As was the case with Burning Crusade, I imagine we&#8217;ll see some quest items and/or Normal drops that will be on par or better than these (i.e. Umbrahowl&#8217;s Collar, Supple Leather Boots, Manimal&#8217;s Cinch, being better than initial pre-buffed Karazhan gear etc.), but remember that this list is rudimentary at best. All items are subject to change often, and may be edited to reflect stat revaluing. Suggestions are welcome, especially as we find out where some of these mystery items drop. <br />

Regardless, there are other Heroic leather items out there, but not quite as dr00d centric, IMO. I'll try to keep this updated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would assume there will be some group[3-5] items worth looking at as well.  Does wowhead allow searching on quest rewards from group[3+] type quests?  I don't recall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember how oddball our quest rewards were in BC.  I'd personally evaluate all quest rewards and all dungeon drops.  <br />
<br />
I like the concept Runy, but I think I'm going to figure out how to get into Naxx sans Heroic.  Heroic tends to be really painful until you have a lot of gear for it.  (god I can see my next blog post and my weekend of research coming now....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought I read that blizzard is going to make heroics easier in the Xpac so they become part of the &quot;progression&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Runyarusco</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I imagine you probably can (search for group quest rewards on Wowhead), but I haven't gone that far just yet. I'll probably give this a decent overhaul in the next week or so. Let me know if you find anything.<br />
<br />
And yes, Heroics are supposedly going to be considerably easier. If the normal runs I've participated in are any indication, they'll be total ez-mode.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You also might be able to hold onto T6/Sunwell items, if you have any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You definitely know your stuff so there's not much we can teach you here, and I'm sure you'll give some of us a new way to look at things. :)  Were I not at work I'd browse through the quest items on Wowhead but we're in a bit of a crunch period right now, and once every few months I actually have to work XD</div></div><hr />
