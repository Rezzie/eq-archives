The devs have made it clear there are NO solo missions that give out the new currency.  They want it that way and they will not change it.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to group, you will have to buy the new currency with plats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are there any missions, that you request with a group, that would be SOLOABLE? I can get guildies/friends to sit in group and afk to request missions, but am ultimately looking for something i'd be able to complete by myself.</div></div><hr />
