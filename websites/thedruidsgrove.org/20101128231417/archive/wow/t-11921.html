And I have been reading all your comments and experiences since day one in preparation for the &quot;big event&quot; :wink: <br />
<br />
Completed 4 quests so far in Hellfire Penninsula, and the reward options are amazing - not to mention perplexing!  Feral? Healing?  Oh my!  <br />
<br />
NOW I know why Druids have space (bag / bank slot) problems.  No matter what our spec, we do everything so, not matter the gear spec, we need it.<br />
:eusa_booh <br />
<br />
I have made more money and received more loot in the past 24 hours in one town in Outland than I ever did pre-portal.<br />
<br />
Suit up!  It's gonna be a fun ride! :biggrin:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-27-2007, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a lvl 70 hunter (I ding'd 58 a few weeks after BC was released) and am now leveling a Druid.  I so miss the usable quest rewards.  Though I understand why there such a big change.<br />
<br />
Since a large population of players had been lvl 60 for some time, they had fairly nice gear when they hit the Outlands.  However, for those leveling thru 60 just like any other pre-70 level, their gear isn't quite a good.  So, early quest rewards help give those late arrivals a boosts.<br />
<br />
BTW, on my hunter I think I change my chest piece 3 times while doing HP quests (twice in 1 day!).</div></div><hr />

With my hunter I waited until I was lvl 60 (mostly because my buddy was busy leveling his primary characters to 70) before I hit the Outlands.<br />
<br />
I found until I was lvl 62 it was a bit difficult.  Not impossible, but rather resource intensive with higher downtime due to the need to eat, drink, bandage more often.  Never had that problem in the rest of the zones (ding'd 70 after completing a third of the BEM quests), just HP.  Having mobs re-spawn so fast was an issue as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not gonna lie to ya, I am quite familiar with the graveyards :rolleyes:  In fact, as a wisp spirit, I darned near fell into oblivion at one graveyard's cliff.<br />
<br />
My dying has primarily been due to walking into mobs trying to unlock my map and unforseen creatures popping up from the ground (hello? worm? from hell?).  But, aside from that, I have been able to hold my own in most cases.  <br />
<br />
However, I must admit, I hit myself with a dose of regrowth before I attack anything, then I drop down into cat form and let the paws fly.  But, self healing is pretty much a necessity in a lot of cases at this point.  <br />
<br />
I met up with a 58 Warrior friend last nite, and we tackled a couple of &quot;red&quot; quests together.  They weren't that bad as a group, together we are quite strong.  But, quite honestly, without my HoT, I think we would have been toast.  <br />
<br />
I got cocky at one point and decided to take on a level 63 - who turned out to be elite.  :tut:   <br />
<br />
On the upside, I discovered another graveyard!  :wink:</div></div><hr />

<br />
But playing in HFP right at release of TBC was fun because everyone was in HFP or Zangar for first day or so.</div></div><hr />

After that i just wanted to try how it would be to level there at my level. It went great.<br />
I grinded up to 58 easily especially the demons near the dark portal, i had no trouble at all. The only problm is that you cant get the quests untill you are lvl 58 :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
and used as bait in the PvP areas of hellfire....yes i died over and over and voer, but it was rather funny watching horde roll up and alliance and ask .....<br />
<br />
WTF you doing here!!!!  then watch them get jumped by the stealthed folks around me =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I recently picked my level 60 rogue back up, I hadn't touched him since the expansion, and he was a low-use alt before it.  His attack power when I started there in Hellfire was 495.<br />
<br />
Within a level and a half, I'd gotten rid of all the embarassing gear and was doing just fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that was a blast.  I remember rolling around and seeing so many horde and ally questing the same things, and feeling weird about not killing on sight... Then the whole place turned into insane world pvp for a while after a group of allys started ganking anyone and anything.  It was cool too seeing people that had been away from the game for a few months come back for the expo.<br />
<br />
Magellan - grats on gettin to outland!  The game gets sooo much more fun and interesting post 60</div></div><hr />
