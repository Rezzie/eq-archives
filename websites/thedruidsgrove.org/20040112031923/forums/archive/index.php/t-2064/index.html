<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering approximately what would the minimum level have to be for a group to kill Lord Djarn? I was thinking of getting a small group together to hang in Solb for a day to get GEBs for me and a few guildies and don't want to have someone too low who dies and then it be all my fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trevize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I first did him at level 40 with 2 groups back before Kunark was released.   These days with mudflation?    Hmmm.   1 group of level 40s should have no issue I would think.<br />
<br />
I know druids who have solo'd it.  I solo'd it at level 60 which is probably well after the point where others solo'd it before me.<br />
<br />
What level range are you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thandril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to his Magelo he is level 49. So a group at around his level should be sufficient. For a first attempt and to allow a more lengthy camp (as he states he may try for multiple pairs) I would take two groups. Allows for some people to get fed up and log plus more scope to mess up a little and still make it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tendalus Treepimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">DC A sonic bat and you're gtg ;)   I know for a fact you can single pull everything but freeti at 60 ~ probably 59</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's good. I figured nowadays it wouldn't be too hard considering how everyone's advanced in power, but I wanted to double check. Nobody wants to be responsible for bringing a group of people into a death trap. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tiniane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got my GEBs in a group before PoP that consisted of me (probably 55-ish at the time) and level 60 Shaman, Enchanter and Monk.<br />
<br />
With the improvements of PoP levels and gear, I would imagine it would be very easy to get to the Efreeti lord with a small group.<br />
