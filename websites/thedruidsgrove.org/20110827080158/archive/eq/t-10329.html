However, some GoD items (Tacvi, Tkarish) items received stat upgrades and new focus, giving more options for heal focus in different slots. Ring of the Serpent and Kaftan of Embroidered light were both given Blessing of the Pious (40% to level 70). Good tradeoff for those using the ancient heal, but if you're using a heal below 68, Discordant Healing is better (45% to level 68).<br />

It was surprising Anguish quest armor was left untouched this patch. No focus on this stuff makes absolutely no sense. It's been assumed foci will be added, but as to when.../shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gaelins arms have 6% spell sheild and the cap has 2% shielding.... Anguish arms has 4ft and cap has 4regen. Other than the HP/MANA I think Muramite armor blows this stuff away. Sure hope they improve these.</div></div><hr />

However, some GoD items (Tacvi, Tkarish) items received stat upgrades and new focusSome other nice upgrades from GoD gear is the addication of Protection of the Dragorn (25% buff ext @ 70) to Shroud of Ceaseless Might (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69066) , FT 2, and 10 more mana.<br />
 <br />
The 'infamous' rot staff from Zun , Blackstone Figurine (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69051) , had FT 5 and 10 avoidance added to it. <br />
 <br />
All tacvi items had 20 hp / mana added to them, and the foci`s on all tacvi / zun loot was changed to their non-anguish OOW counterparts (some of which you've already pointed out.) The biggest plus from that is that Xxxxxxxxxxeric bracer now has Pyrlien Vengence instead of discordant flame. <br />
 <br />
Note -- The lucy links are of the items before they had any foci added to them at all.<br />
 <br />
The only real bad news from patch is that the Qvic glove 'bug' was fixed.</div></div><hr />
