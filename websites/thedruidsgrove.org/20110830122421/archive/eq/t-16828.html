What do you think the chances of this going live is? Or maybe it isn't going to be for PC's but for the mercs? <br />

Not quite sure why they would have changed it over from another spell &quot;Barrier&quot; usable by a warrior to a DRU/SHM res. Surely they would have just created a new spell?</div></div><hr />

I thought I saw somewhere that Druids were getting a resurrection spell with the SoD expansion but I can't find it again.  I do think that 90% makes sense at level 59 if and only if there is another around level 69 that is 96%.  Perhaps tie it into the Call of the Wild AA.</div></div><hr />
