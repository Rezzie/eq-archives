Lately it's had two of them. When I mouse over it I am given the option of changing that piece of gear. I really don't want it at all, but especially don't want it in the middle of the screen. Can anybody tell me how to move/get rid of this icon?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

How counter-intuitive to have to do it from the character screen (it was ALT-click, btw). It's nice to have that mess off my screen.</div></div><hr />

The story of ItemRack imo, nothing seems to be intuitive about it to me &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

But for me it's been dead simple.<br />

To each their own :)</div></div><hr />

I've got it doing two main things for me currently.  First off I have outfits set up in Cat, Bear, and Healer sets.  When I exspect to be in that form for any length of time I have a main set button I use to put it on. (Name your sets with a set prefix to keep them organized for upkeep. aka gear-cat, gear-bear, &amp; gear-Heal)  Second I have weapon/Idol sets.  These are set to change as I shift and use the weapon and Idols that will be most useful in the form I'm currently in.  These can be set on ItemRacks event tab for druid forms.  I have seperate sets for these.  Even have fun sets like fishing sets and such.  <br />
<br />
To get the sets button you Alt+click your picture in the character screen.  I also have my trinkets set out so that they can be switch/clicked from that hotbar so my other bars are freed up for other things.</div></div><hr />
