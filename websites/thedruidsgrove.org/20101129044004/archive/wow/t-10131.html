  As someone that has always liked hybrids and dosent really care about being the big damage doer it made sense, atleast to me to roll a pally alt. My pally is now lvl45 and odly enough I find that I actually like how there damage works. Seal of Command is totally random but when it goes off and crits hard, holy smackdown. <br />
<br />
 Just last night while in Feralas I was attacked by a 47 warrior. We go back and forth I heal a couple times finally getting him down to about 50-60% when bam! white damage hit for 320, SoC crit for 440, repetance (31 point talent=6 second sleep) recast SoC, judge Soc 640 crit and then finished with a Hammer of Wrath crit for 740. That guy must have **** himself because i almost did. 2140 damage in about 10 seconds was cool. Kinda like playing bad golf all day then you get that one perfect drive that keeps you going hehe.<br />
<br />
 Anyways like i said its very random and sometimes few and far between but i like the big suprise when it happens.<br />
 Sorry for talking pally on the druid boards but i just felt like sharing hehe.</div></div><hr />

It's a shame really, they are really awesome for PvE.  The big problem most paladins face is trying to figure out what their class role is.  The most poignant description I've heard is that basically a paladin is there to enhance all the other members of a party.  They get awesome buffs, auras, they can heal and res, and tank at a pinch..  But if they try to specialise in any one of these areas they will always be outstripped by other classes.  I guess it depends how you want to play the class, but imho the best paladins I know work as well as they do because they have embraced the idea that they are a hybrid of many classes.  The worst ones often tend to be retribution paladins trying to do as much damage as possible.<br />

Who can forget the Zinwrath video?  &quot;ARCANITE REAPER, HOOO!!!!!!!&quot;  :P<br />

 Nah....no flameage. I wouldnt sat no skill if only not to insult my paladin brothas. If however that is the case, blizzard is the one to blame. If you look at a pallys offensive choices its really quite laughable. Any good offense they have has to been spec'ed for, and even then there is still alot of luck involved. Hells ya if they get lucky with SoC and with JoC they can knock the snot out of you but then again they can go a whole fight and get nothing.<br />

 There only claim to fame is survival, not by player choice, totally by design. If there is one class that Blizz really dosent know what to do with its the Paladin.</div></div><hr />

Well said...I really think the Pally class should be nerfed a little...it's just absurd when I see 4 or 5 lvl 60s beat the snot out of a lvl 60 pally in AV, watch him throw the bubble up, see &quot;Immune&quot; multiple times, observe how his HP is restored, then walk away from the brawl because 4 or 5 of his buddies came in and wiped out the others (most of those are pallies too). <br />
<br />
I saw similar things in UO when it became arti-fied and now their PvP facet is all but non-existent.</div></div><hr />
