I started with a Night Elf hunter.. mostly because I wanted a pet, hehe, but I got bored around lvl 20 for whatever reason.. Figured a faction change would be nice as well as a class one heh, so I've got a Tauren Druid now. It's holding my attention much better; it feels pretty versatile. If any of you play on Aerie Peak, feel free to poke me some time, I always like doin stuff with other people :) (usually alone, though I've managed to run into a few rather odd people lately lol)<br />
<br />
edit: yeah maybe it'd help if I'd mentioned the character's name is Keirra lol</div></div><hr />
