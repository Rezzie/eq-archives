<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onyko</div><div class="date">09-18-2006, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stopped working in my Druid at level 58 to work on my hunter and shaman, but I decided to finishing leveling her and finally hit 60 in two days. I still have this Druid quest in my log though (A better ingrediant), and I need to get it done. I have two questions:<br />
<br />
1) I've read that it can be solo'ed at level 60. Anyone have any advice on how to do it before I try it myself? I'm planning on farming some stuff for major pots and buffs beforehand. And maybe some direction on where to go in the Sunken Temple find to the troll boss that drops the vine? <br />
<br />
2) I have the Ironfeather chespiece and shoulders right now, giving me a +20 to healing spells. As a resto druid, would it be better to go with the 55+ chestpiece from this reward? I'm having doubts about letting the Ironfeather piece go because I like the stats. Ironfeather is +18 int and +22 spi while the quest chestpiece is only +7 int and + 8 spi. So my question is: is +35 healing worth losing all that int and spi? I'm starting to consider the staff as an alternative, I'm using the Twig of The World Tree right now and I like the 21+ stam.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice and opinions you have.</div></div><hr />

However, about the Ironfeather set vs. the 55healing chestpiece, use the Ironfeather set for farming and damage dealing in PvP (b/c the set bonus gives +20 dmg/healing).  Use the +55 healing chestpiece for instances where you're the healer (or raids, if thats what you do or plan to do).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you can take on the boss.  I've never tried to solo him though, so I can't help you there.</div></div><hr />

Idunno I did it with a group of friends (I sat in middle with shammy and hunter while we directed the 2 rogues around to activate the statues for the boss). Was finished in about 25 minutes &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Okay I didnt know that. :p Thanks. <br />
<br />
@ Yakiniku - Thats a good idea, I'll just swap them out when needed. <br />
<br />
@ Trixtaa - Thats what I'm thinking will be the hardest part -- I'm impatient when it comes to stealthing around everything. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />
