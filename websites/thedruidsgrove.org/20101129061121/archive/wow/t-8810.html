Normally whenever there are Druids in the vast Ogrimmar battle you can easily tell from the white pillars of light on both sides.  The frequency of these is an easy determinant of just how many of us hard-to-kill buggers there are.<br />
<br />
Now, I've been known to moonspam from time to time when chasing somebody down and the battle is pretty much over, just to bludgeon them to death (it's a crude way of killing, and I'm not a fan) but the number you can fire off is somewhat limited.<br />
<br />
Go back to rank 1 though, and you can fire those things off forever.  I think I'll try playing paladin some time and run into the middle of the Alliance yelling and throwing off rank 1 moonfires until I fall in a messy heap of fur. :)  Has anyone tried this, or the equivalent of lighting up entire ranks of foes for visual effect, and is it as fun as my mental picture is making it out to be?  :grin: <br />

When you see your screen filled to the brim with 200's, it's pretty funny.   Of course I died shortly after, but I wonder if a group of 10 players had this and used them all at one time could you actually bring down people?</div></div><hr />
