I'd prefer to blow things up with my machine gun Wraths but if I'm standing still that long for a cast I'm going to get beat on. <br />
<br />
I know people complain about MF spammers but in BG's where maneuverability is very important I find our offensive weapons to be lacking. While I'm not saying we need more instant cast nukes I am sort of justifying why some Druids use MF a lot. <br />
<br />
In AV's and AB's I find I'm in the edge of a fight casting MF &amp; IS then throwing some heals out there. If it's Drek or someone I'll use Fairy Fire or of a particularly well geared tank is being melee'ed by one of our guys I'll use it too. I'll also CC with Cyclone if someone is trying to cap our flag and root runners. <br />
<br />
I don't know if you find yourselves doing things differently in these BG's but I'd like to hear if I'm doing things wrong or what you guys/gals are doing. <br />
<br />
I usually end up near the top for healing and middle of the pack for DPS so that's my comfort level. I rarely get killing blows though but it's no biggie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main nuke spell I use is Starfire, for the simple reason that it comes out of the sky - as opposed to Wrath, which comes from the Moonkin, and instantly shows the enemy your location.<br />
<br />
Try hiding behind a tree or some other natural cover, and sniping.  Half the time I find people simply twirl about on the spot, trying to work out where the hell the Moonkin is.  Then they die.  :&gt;<br />

I always see them hiding behind trees, etc.  Unless it is a huge 15 v 15 type battle going on in the middle of AV.</div></div><hr />

Shadowmeld is also a very useful ability for sniper druids :&gt;<br />
