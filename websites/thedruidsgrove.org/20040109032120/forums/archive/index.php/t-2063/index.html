<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TinyDru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have started PLing my Shammy by having him group with me and me killing stuff.  My question is - would I be further ahead to:<br />
<br />
A) Kill things that are green to me but blue / yellow to him.  This would seem to guaruntee that he would get all of the XP because I would get none.<br />
<br />
 -or-<br />
<br />
B) Kill things that are red to him, regardless of what they con to me.  This would in most cases give XP to me and him, but would it be a great enough difference (considering the mobs would be red to him) to overcome the XP sharing (so that it would be better than A)?<br />
<br />
Heh - that sounds confusing to even me - and I wrote it...  Ah well - hopefully you understand my question and can give me some advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">in case (A) , he would NOT get all the XP.  The XP that should have been yours will just be wasted.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, kill stuff that's tough for you (ie your normal XP mobs), and let him soak it up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TinyDru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, in case A (things green to me but blue or higher to him), he is the only one that gets XP.  Since they are green to me, I get no XP and he gets a hit.  I tested this yesterday at the Tizmaks - they are green to me and blue to him.  I root dotted one - I received no XP, but he did.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that a portion of the XP from that kill goes to no one then (e.g. the &quot;group&quot; split portion that would go to me gets allotted but not applied due to the fact that the mob is green to me)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tiny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
For my chanter, I grouped, had her invis, and I quadded stuff.  She levelled pretty quickly =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TinyDru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh - had I been paying better attention to your first reply, I would have noticed that part - sorry about that :) .<br />
<br />
Alrighty then - off to do some XPing.  I never imagined that I would be able to get XP for both my PLer and PLee at the same time :) .<br />
<br />
Thanks much!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tendalus Treepimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What level can a lower level toon start getting exp grouped with a 65 toon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe 44<br />
<br />
Lowest level needs to be 2/3s of highest level.<br />
<br />
Except for LDoN, all group members must be within 7 levels.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">43 is the lowest level that someone can group with a 65 and still get exp.<br />
<br />
Apparently they either round or truncate after taking 2/3 of the highest level (2/3 of 65 is 43 1/3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TinyDru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used the 1.5 multiplier rule (divide the PLer level by 1.5), and it seems to have held - my Druid is 58 and my PLee is 38 and he gets XP when I group with him.<br />
