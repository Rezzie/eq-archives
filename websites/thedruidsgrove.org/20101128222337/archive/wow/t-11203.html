I sure hope there is an upgrade to that staff in my hands in the next two months though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">10-23-2006, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking +25 agi since that would greatly increase my tanking especially when trying to crit multiple targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">10-23-2006, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely +25 agi. It gives 1.25% dodge, 1.25% crit (better threat and more rage because of more crits), and a tad armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-23-2006, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, 25 agility for sure.  I got mine enchanted like 7 months ago with +15str before I really thought about it or read up on it.  I want to reenchant it, but cant bring myself to waste a +15str enchant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay now that I have +25 agility, next Question:<br />
<br />
Should I stick with my wildheart set and wait for The  Burning Crusade or do those mundane feralheart quests or just continue farming my cenarion set? Take note that I am currently feral/resto specced and have the full wildheart set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The feralheart upgrade quests are fun, and at times very challenging, if a bit pricey.  If cash isn't a problem for you I would give them a shot and see how far you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While feralheart isn't bad as a hybrid set, you'll still need a solid healing set come BC.  IMO, work on your Cen set and anything feral that drops in MC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feralheart it is then since im busy getting my SHotM as well. After my unfortunate de accident im taking up skining again :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkelf</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok like this .<br />
Most of the ppl think that feralheart is bad set but they are really wrong . Most of them think its crap and they just jump over it but when they start raiding aq20 , zg , mc than there is a problem , dieing all the time . 0.5 set is made to help guild with 20 man raids , then you can get Cenarion , Stormrage or whatever.<br />
<br />
Most of them think its really easy to get it too but you need to be aware of time you need to spend on it . If you are bad luck you need a lot of time to get whole wildheart , finish all quests  for upgrade and so on . Feralheart is nice set ( of course its crap for nax , aq40 ) but it's good for ony , mc , aq20 and zg . That's my opinion</div></div><hr />

thats because it is, various blues with +heal (DM/UBRS/Strat...etc) are 100x better for healing druids. I've never used Wildheart for ZG/AQ/MC/BWL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Feralheart and the Blue PvP set are both really close in stats. I think you get more mana with the Feralheart but more AP with the Blue PvP set. I have both complete sets, and one week from the complete epic PvP set and I can honestly say Ive used my feralheart set maybe....5 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ... im gonna get it anyways since it looks pretty weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JWK</div><div class="date">10-31-2006, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a proud owner of a full set of feralheart (and 5 or 8 cenarion), I wear my full feralheart for everything.  I've tanked every boss pre-20 man/MC (less Valthalak) using full feralheart, i've healed a 45-min baron run using full feralheart, and i've DPS'd every instance pre-20 man/MC using full feralheart.<br />
<br />
I'm such a big fan of the Dungeon 2 line, I finished my shaman to 60 and got the full Five Thunders Set.  I'm equally as happy with the full Five Thunders.<br />
<br />
I really wouldn't &quot;want&quot; to replace any of this gear except with itemized pieces from BWL or the 5-piece set from AQ</div></div><hr />
