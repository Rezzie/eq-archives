http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70893<br />
<br />
As much as I hate to admit it, even after all this time I'm still rather confused by the information on Lucy.  Am I reading this right?  The effect is a 25% spell haste, cast (not worn), encompassing all spells, cast time is .8 of a second (let's just round it up and call it one second), lasting 7 ticks, with a recast delay of 5 minutes.  To top it all off, and this is where I really get confused, it doesn't stack with any other spell haste, not even the worn variety.  Please tell me I'm all wrong about this, and that it's not another severe disappointment, but will be of great benefit in all situations.<br />
<br />
The rest of it is quite nice though, especially the bene mana pres.</div></div><hr />

One would assume the best tunic to date would have the best AC to date. Mail of judgement still the AC king but I would think thats because its shaman and cleric usable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most likely it works the same way as the tier 1 tunic.  It gives you 25% spell haste on anything that affects hp (heals, nukes, dots), stacks with worn spell haste, does not stack with cast spell haste but doesn't overwrite it either.  (Both buff icons will show but only the best effect will be used.)  50% spell haste is still the cap, and this effect won't let you exceed that.<br />
<br />
The main disappointment, at least with the tier 1 tunic, is the &quot;Max Hits&quot; part.  The tier 1 effect has &quot;Max Hits: 2&quot;, meaning it will only work on the next two eligible spells over the next 30 seconds.  The tier 2 effect has &quot;Max Hits: 4&quot;, which is a bit better I suppose but it still seems like an unnecessary restriction.</div></div><hr />

Luckily found this thead, I didn't realize the effect worked on 'all' spells I just assumed was beneficial. The clicky itself doesn't seem all that great compared to some other anguish chests. We're already at 40% beneficial haste and 33% (43%? if you have QD3) detrimental haste on raids as is. With a 50% spell haste cap it's a very small upgrade which must be clicked to work.<br />
 <br />
With SCR and SCRM it lasts 10 ticks (60 seconds) and the max amount of spells it affects is 4.<br />
 <br />
Tried it with Karana's Renewal and it doesn't affect the cast time.<br />
 <br />
Other cast times I noted:<br />
Ancient Chlorobon - 1.9 seconds (maxed possible)<br />
Solstice Strike - 3.1 seconds (maxed possible, actually lower because of how EQ rounded)<br />
Wasp Storm - 3.1 seconds (48% haste, almost max so we do get full benefit on DoTs)<br />
 <br />
I think the AC is lower than Yelnia's because Yelnia's is monk/bst usable also. I bet monk anguish quest gear has an overall higher AC than ours, didn't actually check though.<br />
 <br />
Going from Time bp to Anguish bp I'm very very happy, the mods / resists / hp and mana / focus effect are all great. Wizards got the same shaft with clicky.</div></div><hr />

It's strange that it doesn't work on CH. Means that's somehow coded into CH or something.</div></div><hr />

It's still weird that a Mail is the highest AC tunic 6 expansions later.</div></div><hr />

I dont have the coa bp yet, but I've tried out the effect with the tier 1 BP. (same effect with lower duration) I can deal with the tier 1 effect being crap, but the coa bp clicky should really be something that's worth a damn.<br />
<br />
These clickys need to be 'over haste' and not be capped against the 50% max.<br />
<br />
(nerfing the tier 1 effect down to ~15% would seem appropriate if they fix the cap issue.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">07-22-2005, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might have found a good use for the clicky:<br />
 <br />
During warden event, sometimes you'll get a messege &quot;You resist Chains of Anguish&quot; -- your still snared but your spell cast time will not be effected (it may appear that your spell will take a long time to cast, but it will cast before the bar runs out.)  <br />
 <br />
So, if you click BP while &quot;resisted&quot; chains of anguish is on you, you'll cast hasted* spells but your casts -while chains is on you- won't go towards the max hits quota.  <br />
 <br />
*since I don't play EQ with a stop watch next to me, I can't comfirm the spell cast times outside eyeing it.  If you inspect the spell gems, it'll show slowed cast times.</div></div><hr />

What to you want to bet that with the next exspansion you get a much more common heal that is on par if not better than the Ancient making this BP go from the uber of the uber to just so so.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
...I'm aware that the spell slow componet is resistable...<br />
 <br />
----------<br />
<br />
If you inspect your spell gems during a Chain's resist, the spell cast times show as slowed -- even though they won't cast slowed. So somewhere along the line, it's registered as being slowed even though you'll cast in normal or hasted time. If you click BP through this, you'll cast normal or hasted spells that won't go towards the max hit. It seems like they are BP hasted from simply eyeing them, but I can't confirm that.</div></div><hr />
