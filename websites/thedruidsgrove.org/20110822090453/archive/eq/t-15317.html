<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Penasi</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trade skill bug has bitten me and I need money - so I need to sell off some of my toys.  One item I think I will sell is my Holgresh Elder Beads.  On my server (cazic), I've seen them for sale anywhere from 650k-900k (no idea if they sell for that - just what I've noticed).<br />
 <br />
So I ooc them in bazaar this morning for 600k and basically got laughed out of the zone.  In ooc and through replies to unsolicited tells, I tried to explain the difficulty in getting these - as well as the benifits.  I was called absolutely crazy, accused of price gauging and only catering to those that buy plat.  Not one person seemed to think I was close to a reasonable price.<br />
 <br />
Now I understand that most ppl will never have this kind of plat.  This is a toy for those that have nothing left to spend plat on - or pullers.  I guess what I'm asking - am I really one of those rediculous sellers - or is this a fair price?<br />
 <br />
fyi - beads no longer drop.  only way to get them is through the casino (which is where I got them).  I spent weeks in the casino and about 1.7million plat to get all the casino items.  Really only 3 worth having - beads, illusion mask and the drog imo (and mask is more for status than anything).<br />
 <br />
If I'm totally off-base I'll likely just keep them.  I'm not posting this to see what the most I can get from them is.  I'd just like some reasonable comments from reasonable people.  Is my experience in the casino just super unlucky?  Do others win gold tickets with such regularity that 600k for the beads is just outlandish?<br />
 <br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I believe the price on the beads has always been high.<br />
Just put up your trader and list them. Make a separate tell window and use in game email to reply to those serious about bartering.<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't think your price is off base, but it's not a &quot;bargain&quot;.  If you want to move them quick, put them on a trader at 400k - they should go soon enough.  Keep it at 600k if you're prepared to wait a little... and if you want to get an even 600, put them at 650 so you have some negotiating room :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for HEB's I bought mine back on Bristlebane about a year ago for 450k and that was a steal from a friend - the going price then was 600k so I could see it having changed a bit but probably not by much. There are always variances from server to server though. They are a novelty item that doesn't drop anymore and there is a demand for them, it's just that not everyone realizes that. The people who do want them will more than likely realize a realistic price when they see it.</div></div><hr />

OK - now to change the discussion a bit.  While trying to explain the benifits of the beads again in bazaar (I swear I get hastle every time I /auction it), a nice mage chimed in that it could get you into places as well.<br />
 <br />
He then went on to explain how you can use the eye to target mobs on other side of a locked door, send in your pet - do enough damage and the mob will summon you through.  I was excited!  Something to try I hadn't done before in EQ.  So I went down to crypt in Seb to try it.  I summuned up ol' BooBoo, put a DW on him and then added the aa DS we get (to do the damage).  Seems the mobs don't summon in the crypt - so it didn't work.  They just ran outside of crypt and I killed them there - never got in though.<br />
 <br />
Any thoughts on zones this WOULD work in?  I'm gonna head into sraa and mess around there I think.  Any other zones?  Any mobs that are typically off limits I can get to now?</div></div><hr />

Only some of the chardok mobs summon, as far as Sebilis, I think at some point more mobs there summoned than do now.  I tried the trick in sebilis and never could find a summoning mob within pet attack range of the door.</div></div><hr />
