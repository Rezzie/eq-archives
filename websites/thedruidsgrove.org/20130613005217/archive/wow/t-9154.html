<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haurid</div><div class="date">08-10-2005, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I’m new here, I’ve been looking for a decent place to talk about druids, I hope I’ve found the right place.<br />
<br />
I’m level 59 druid half way to level 60 and I’m thinking about re-talenting for the cookie-cutter. After considering all the other possibilities, I find that the cookie-cutter talent build is best suited to my style of play, as I find it’s the best way to get the best of all worlds, while still having innervate as an emergency backup, even though I rarely need it for PVP, it’s good to know it’s there just in case.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I’m not sure which sort of things I should go for, so I was hoping I could have some feedback on my ideas, or see what other level 60 druids use.<br />
<br />
This is what I was thinking:<br />
<br />
Balance (9):<br />
- Nature’s Grasp (1/1)<br />
- Improved Nature’s Grasp (4/4)<br />
- Improved Entangling Roots (2/3)<br />
- Nature’s Reach (2/2)<br />
<br />
Feral (11)<br />
- Ferocity (5/5)<br />
- Improved Bash (2/2)<br />
- Sharpened Claws (3/5)<br />
- Feral Charge (1/1)<br />
<br />
Restoration (31)<br />
- Improved Mark of the Wild (5/5)<br />
- Improved Healing Touch (5/5)<br />
- Nature’s Focus (5/5)<br />
- Reflection (5/5)<br />
- Improved Rejuvenation (5/5)<br />
- Nature’s Swiftness (1/1)<br />
- Gift of Nature (1/1)<br />
- Combat Endurance (2/5)<br />
- Improved Regrowth (1/5)<br />
- Innervate (1/1)<br />
<br />
In balance, I’m not sure if I should sacrifice one point in Improved Entangling Roots for a point in Nature’s Reach, as I will have nature’s grasp to back me up. <br />
<br />
In feral, is it a good idea to put 3 points in sharpened claws or Improved Demonising Roar, or maybe a bit of both?<br />
<br />
In restoration, is it a good idea to put 2 points in combat endurance instead of improved regrowth or something else?<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any feedback and to see what other level 60 druids currently use.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Scott.</div></div><hr />

I actually do 8/11/32 if i remember correctly. I wanted a little more focus on feral than your build provides, but sacrificed Improved Rejuv and a point in Improved Healing Touch to get it. Here it is below:<br />
<br />
Balance Talents -  8 points	<br />
  Nature's Grasp  rank 1/1<br />
  Improved Nature's Grasp  rank 4/4<br />
  Swiftshifting  rank 3/3<br />
<br />
 Feral Combat Talents -  11 points	<br />
  Ferocity  rank 5/5<br />
  Improved Bash  rank 2/2<br />
  Sharpened Claws  rank 3/5<br />
  Feral Charge  rank 1/1<br />
<br />
Restoration Talents -  32 points	<br />
  Improved Mark of the Wild  rank 5/5<br />
  Furor  rank 5/5<br />
  Nature's Focus  rank 5/5<br />
  Improved Healing Touch  rank 4/5<br />
  Gift of Nature  rank 1/1<br />
  Reflection  rank 5/5<br />
  Nature's Swiftness  rank 1/1<br />
  Improved Regrowth  rank 5/5<br />
  Innervate  rank 1/1<br />
<br />
I have yet to have Nature's Reach, so i cannot comment on what I am missing with this build, but i havent had any issues rooting or people running oor from roots while casting. I find myself wanting Improved Rejuv, simply because it is THE most common spell i find myself casting. Improved Regrowth is fantastic, i would take it all the way to 5 points if you can. <br />
<br />
From all accounts i have read, Improved Demoralizing Roar is worthless. Best spending points in sharpened claws.<br />
<br />
So, my build gives me a slightly more feral focus, gaining Furor (incredibly handy for fighting in bear form, starting with 10 rage is HUGE, more noteably in pvp)and swiftshifting, which i think is fantastic. Same cookie cutter more or less, but just catered to how i like to divvy up my play a bit more.</div></div><hr />

Combat Endurance isn't worth it.  Most shaman don't even spec it and for them it's only 1 talent point for the full 10 pct.<br />
<br />
While it's true that Rejuv is likely your most often cast heal, you simply can't main-heal well without Improved Regrowth in one area:  Keeping a cloth AE class (Mage / Warlock) alive while they are burning down a large group of mobs.<br />
<br />
Nature's Reach is a great talent.  I would skip Imp Root and put points in that, or Imp Moonfire or Swiftshifting even.</div></div><hr />

This build works for me for the most part.  I've gotten used to not using Nature's Grasp, and after playing around in Balance with swiftshifting, I found I rarely found the 6 seconds enough time to do anything and shapeshift back especially in PvP combat when your casting is constantly interrupted, or you are stunned and what not.  I know I could probably use Nature's Grasp especially for certain classes but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">08-16-2005, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Improved Healing Touch is a waste of talent points, much better spent in Improved Rejuvenation. This isn't my current build, but it's what I used to have. I went to what I thought was a more pvp-oriented build with more in Balance and Feral, but honestly the loss of Innervate and Imp Regrowth is not even close to being made up for with the small DPS gains. I'll be going back to this build soon.<br />

<br />
For PvP, I somewhat agree, especially in a Warsong Gulch atmosphere.  However, there are time in PvP I still get the opportunity to hang back and heal.  Spamming Regrowth is horribly innefficent.<br />
<br />
In PvE, Improved HT is great, unless you don't  play as a primary healer.  On raids, as part of a healing group on a tank, Imp HT is a huge mana saver, and certainly more valuable than Imp Rejuv.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coso</div><div class="date">08-16-2005, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if Swiftshifting ability was really worth getting from the balance tree. I noticed alot of druids put the full 3 points into it. But not sure if the 6 sec really gives you enough time to use this ability alot. I don't have this ability myself, but I plan on trying it out just to see how it goes. But was wondering what you guys think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">08-18-2005, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love Swiftshifting 3, when I re-spec I will go down to Swiftshifting 2, but really wish I could keep level 3. When I first got it, I didn't seem to get much benefit from it. But I picked up the Swiftshift addon, which gives you audible feedback when you successfully use Swiftshifting, and I was totally surprised by how often it got used. Now in the BGs, Swiftshifting is a HUGE benefit. Fighting in bear form and out of rage for a bash? Caster-Bear for 10 free rage. Want to save some mana before going straight to bear/cat? Go travel-caster-bear/cat.</div></div><hr />
