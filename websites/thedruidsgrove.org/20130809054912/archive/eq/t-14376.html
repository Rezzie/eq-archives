Druid Spell List from BETA<br />
<br />
<br />
This post is an overview of the Druid Spells from TSS as well as changes to spell mechanics that affect us. <br />
<br />
SPELL RANKS<br />
<br />
Almost every spell in TSS will have ranks:<br />
<br />
Rank1: vendor bought - +18% boost over OoW spell its upgrading<br />
Rank2: 1 group content drop/quests - +23% boost<br />
Rank3: Raid level content - +29% boost<br />
...and sometimes...<br />
Rank4: Rare drop in Raid level content - +35% boost (similar to &quot;Ancient&quot; spells in previous expansions)<br />
<br />
The percentage boost is approximate and subject to change, but this gives you a good idea of how its structured.<br />
<br />
Not all spells have ranks.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The first rank will be vendor buyable. That's right, every one will have access to every L71-75 spell at Rank 1; soloers, groupers, raiders, hardcore, casuals, alts, bots, hydras, you name it. No questing, researching or bazaar gouging. Rank 2 spells will drop from 1 groupable content/quests across the entire expansion, Rank 3 spells will drop from raid level content and Rank 4 will be rare drops from raid level content. Rank 3/4 spells will NOT be tradable.<br />
<br />
LOCATION OF SPELL VENDORS FOR TIER 1 SPELLS: http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showpost.php?p=208236&amp;postcount=24<br />
<br />
When you scribe a higher rank spell, it will replace the lower rank spell in your spell book and on your hotkey bar to reduce clutter. Higher tier spells will NOT require that you have the lower tier spells first. You can scribe whatever tier you recieve as long as it is higher than what you have already got (i.e. you cannot scribe Rank1 if you have already scribed Rank3.)<br />
<br />
Also, this from Dev Prathun:<br />
Cast times are staying the same as predecessor spells with few exceptions.  Efficiency on combat spells is increasing slightly across the board (mana cost vs effect) while the DPS or HealPS is increasing substantially.  And that's generally what improves from rank to rank.  Not all spells fit neatly into that mold, so some spells have increased duration or level cap or resist modifiers instead.<br />
UPGRADES vs. NEW SPELL LINES<br />
<br />
You will NOT see upgrades of druid cheal, group POI/DIS cure or the quested spells from DoD or PoR (Barkspur, Moonshadow, Aura of Life, Skin of Reptile, Dawnstrike). This was hotly debated with the devs during the beta process, but their decision is final for the launch of this expansion.<br />
<br />
You will see much needed upgrades of many of our core spell lines.<br />
<br />
And you will see the following new spell lines:<br />
<br />
NEW RESIST: Corruption Resist Buff, Cure for Corruption counters, Group Cure for Corruption (see below)<br />
ALTER NPC BODY TYPE: Change the mobs's body type to PLANT and increases FR spell damage and slashing damage(see below)<br />
EMERGENCY HEAL: Fast casting, mana intensive, high yield heal with chance to proc a melee guard<br />
SELF DIVINE INTERVENTION: Self only buff that, upon the druid's health falling below zero, has a chance to proc invulnerability (cannot cast or attack), plus a direct heal and a heal over time.<br />
FIRE+COLD COMBO NUKE: Two nukes, one spell. This first fires off a fire nuke, then a cold nuke. Both have resist checks and if the first one fails, so does the second, but if they both land -- big spike damage for druids. The downside is this spell has an added aggro component.<br />
ZEPHYRS: Druids can port others to TSS zones without zoning themselves, similar to Wizards Translocate spells (but no reagents!)<br />
<br />
<br />
CORRUPTION<br />
<br />
A new type of counter, similar to Disease, Poison, Curse, etc., is being introduced: Corruption. Players will not be getting corruption based damage spells yet, but will be getting corruption buffs and cures. Corruption effects will mostly be encountered with high end content, not so much with 1 group and soloable content. Since this is a new resist type, +corruption resist augs will be introduced as well.<br />
<br />
Prismatic or chromatic spells will NOT take the mob's corruption resist into account. There will be no corruption curing AAs for this expansion and Infusion of the Faithful Vet AA will not buff it.<br />
<br />
<br />
BODYTYPE ALTERATION<br />
<br />
Druids will get a debuff that changes a mobs body type to PLANT for a short duration and increases fire based spell damage and slashing damage. Other classes are getting spells that can debuff, charm, slow and do additional damage plants. Also, shaman get the ability to change a mob's body type to animal, allowing us to use our animal charm, MR debuff and fear. This line of bodytype alteration spells is designed to provide more interaction among the classes. Note, the mob's appearance will not change, just how the game identifies it's body type for the purposes of spells landing.<br />
<br />
<br />
FOCUS EFFECTS<br />
<br />
New items are dropping in TSS with L75 Focus Effects. <br />
<br />
Certain pre-TSS focus items have had their level raised:<br />
- Focus items from Deathknell (PoR raid zone) and Demiplane (DoD raid zone) will be retroactively raised to L72<br />
- Epic 2.0 items will have their effects raised to L75<br />
<br />
<br />
RESEARCH<br />
<br />
Research Tradeskillers will be able to create L65-70 OoW spells now. Quest reward spells from DoN, DoD &amp; PoR are not researchable at this point. Check www.eqtraders.com for a list of new components necessarry.</div></div><hr />

NEW TELEPORTATION SPELLS<br />
<br />
Druids have rings, circles, and zephyrs (a translocate, essentially) to The Steppes, Direwind, and Blightfire Moors. These telportational spells can be bought from vendors located at each ring.<br />
<br />
Ring/Circle/Zephyr of Blightfire - L20 (This is a L20-40 zone)<br />
Ring/Circle/Zephyr of The Steppes - L60 (This is a L60-70 zone)<br />
Ring/Circle/Zephyr of Direwind - L70 (This is a L70-75 zone)<br />
<br />
<br />
LOCATION OF DRUID SPELL SCROLLS<br />
<br />
Rank I Druid Spells can be bought from Rang Kelliam (-340, 278) in The Steppes. He is trackable from the druid rings.<br />
<br />
Rank II Druid Spells drop randomly from mobs in L65+ zones in TSS (Vergalid Mines, Sunderrock, The Steepes, Icefall, Direwild, Ashengate, Valdehome, Frostcrypt). These spell scrolls should be tradable.<br />
<br />
Rank III Druid Spells are received by rune turn in. Glowing Obsidian Runes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52676) drop from TSS raid mobs and are turned in to Kalim`Kar the Gold in Ashengate. He's just inside the zone, before the first big door you see, to the right and down a bit, hidden somewhat between the rocks @ n275 n100. The order of Rank III spells received is being compiled here (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=14538).<br />

We had Mask of the Griffon slotted for a level 75 spell that includees the new see invis 2 component. When they cut the new invis type for now this spell was cut. We are still lobbying to get it back for the extra mana regen we are accustomed to getting every five levels.<br />

Well Fire of dawn affects all nukes once you have the effect so cast that and then cast the fire/ice nuke for better damage : P.  Kinda like how most wizzies only do etherflame on GoM lol.<br />

now i dunno about you guys, but i also struggle for spell slots and cant really afford to have 2 nukes up most of the time. the only way around that would be to swap nukes out every time i had a proc which really isnt viable.</div></div><hr />

The rank 1 spells are positively dangerous - eg. mezz rank 1 has no resist adjust so you end up with more failed mezz, which makes you a liability. Raiding chanters STILL get an edge over casuals.

<br />
The spell cuts have obviously been the words on everyone's lips (fingertips?) here on the boards the last few days, and it's true, I've pared down the number of spells per class to about 5 per melee, 15 per hybrid, and 25 per pure caster or priest.  This was done for multiple reasons:  to keep things simple, consistent, to make spell acquisition uncluttered, and to remove spells that were at the bottom of the desirability spectrum.  I know this is where the primary issue lies, since the community was looking forward to a handful of spells which didn't make the cut.  In fact, it's safe to say that there's a tangible anxiety that certain class-defining spell lines will be forgotten forever.<br />
  <br />
 It shouldn't be a problem.  We can add in spells to the drop tables and vendors, after launch, for those spells that are indispensable.  I know that level capped abilities, in particular, are a point of contention because if an upgrade is not included for Serpent's Spine then that ability ceases to work completely.  You can count on Drifting Fog and the other lulls making an appearance.<br />

 <br />
Moonshadow.<br />
 <br />
I can understand the concept behind not wanting to give upgrades for the dod and por quested spells.  And yes, I agree.  BUT, at 75 this spell is not gonna heal a great enough percent of the groups life with the hp increase to even bother keeping it memmed.  With well geared tanks and hybrids and even some priests this spell unless u get a crit is barely noticeable in it's heal.  And with the long recast not like we can keep casting it faster to compensate.  I only just got this spell like a month ago and within another week it'll be useless and we will be back to no practical group heal again.  So, in the name of preserving the need to do quests from previous expansions they have screwed us again as we will end up having the same old issues on raids with group dying from ae's again.<br />
 <br />
There has to be a solution to this.  Either soe needs to suck it up and give us an upgrade anyhow.  Druids will still need to do sky3 for progression anyhow, not like it's dod spell mission where the sole purpose is to acquire said spell.<br />
 <br />
Or, modify the existing spell.  Make it have a chance to leave a small HoT on group after cast.  Or increase it's base healing.  Or actually, just make the recast time same as other heals (i.e. ancient cholorbon) so we can cast it faster to try and compensate.  The latter probably being the easiest and best way to fix the issue.  Cause unless you are 75 with good gear you wouldn't be able to chain cast that mana instensive spell too long.<br />
 <br />
Anyhow, this is a real issue and needs some sort of resolution.  =/</div></div><hr />

That they pulled both fire dots indicates that not much thought went into the cuts. That's a shame, but it's hardly atypical for SOE, most of whom I'd wager do not themselves play EQ1 regularly.<br />

I don't pretend to know anything about what is going on or went on in beta, but something stinks with regard to cutting out spell lines like this.  <br />
<br />
At the very, very least it was shockingly poor management to wait until after the NDA was lifted to make these changes.  I also suggest that last minute messing around like this is very rarely well thought out.<br />

<br />
I had heard this mentioned elsewhere.  It is, in my humble opinion, as stupid a concept as I've ever come across.  It punishes classes with an above average number of spell lines, and that doesn't even address the apparently random and ill-considered choice of cut spells.<br />
<br />
It also calls into question the post-launch reintroduction of spell lines.  Why on earth would you cut spells in order to create some arbitrary class parity, and then subsequently reintroduce them?  This makes a mockery of cutting them in the first place, surely.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, of course, I'm &quot;angry&quot; for no good reason, and the cut spells were not in fact ready to go live.  If they were working okay in Beta, though, I can't see what reason there would be to cut them.  Maybe I should stop whining and just let things happen as they will :P</div></div><hr />

Along with a few others, Fenier has been very active on the beta boards. Tag teaming issues we thought were important we got a lot of changes and adjustments made. So really the snide comments are uncalled for. If you're unhappy well then you're unhappy. Perhaps next beta cycle you'll take the time to get involved.<br />
<br />
Fenier didn't cut the spells and we had no say in it or warnings. We're delivering the information we have received, period. I'm not happy about the cuts either but if Prathun says they are coming post launch then I'm going to just believe him this time. I got the impression that his hands were tied at this point and given how open he was to all our feedback during the beta cycle he deserves the benefit of the doubt this time around.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious?<br />
 <br />
Am I the only one who's extremely disappointed with this list? <br />
 <br />
From the look of things, the majority of these spells aren't even going to be -worth- using over the Omens spells (for a Qvic geared or less druid) due to the lack of new focus effects. I think they'll find that most people (druids at least) will just stick to OoW and DoDH spells. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Most of these spells (and our new AAs for that matter) are just copied and pasted from older crap with roughly the same efficiency. The only real problem with that fact is that since there's no focus effects to help these, they'll end up being less efficient! Plus they're even taking out the ones that would've been used (mask, attack debuff, fire DoT)?! I know we have to &quot;take their word on it&quot; that they'll be released in the future, but honestly, how well can we trust their word now? We'll probably see them next expansion (6 months?). I highly doubt I'll be using any of these except like four (self DI, direwild, direwood guard, adrenaline surge) due to the fact that my focus effects will barely do anything to save me mana and make them more efficient.<br />
 <br />
On a side note, why do we get a spell that marks an NPC as a plant when we're the ones who have animal spells? Seriously, am I the ONLY ONE who thinks this is retarded? It's a really neat and cool idea and the spell itself is great... but... come on.<br />

In our case, since we can Charm Animals, I think the concern was we'd be able to charm in any zone with th ecorrect level mobs by using the spell to make it an animal, then charming it, and this was unacceptable. which I agree with, since we're not chanters.<br />

Likewise, no classes got a turn bodytype to Undead (Necro/Paladin issues) or Summoned (Mage, Ranger, Druid issues, iirc).</div></div><hr />

This was something explicitly stated by the devs on the beta boards. The players were very unhappy with this news so the devs decided to increase the focus effect min Level to 72 on items out of DoD and PoR raid zones. <br />

<br />
Secondly, the level 75 Limit people have been seeing on Skin to Vines, is the max level of the spell to be fully focused when getting the +fire damage.  The spell can be used on any level of mob, including, I would assume - raid bosses, thus adding to the entire raids Fire and Slashing Damage.<br />
<br />
I see this as more powerful honestly, then the Shaman +blunt / MR spell, unless of course, the mob was FR to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Existing focus effects will not be upgraded to work to level 75 spells. There is a short list of demiplane, deathknell and sullon/suchun/daosheen items that are having their caps bumped up to 72 (degrading 10% per level above that.)<br />
 <br />
There will be new focus effects that are capped at level 75 from TSS raids. However, some focus effects will remain the same percentage as now. Example:<br />
 <br />
Alacrity of the Ikaav (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6478&amp;source=Live) is a 30% beneficial haste focus capped at 70. There will be a 30% beneficial haste focus on TSS items that caps at level 75. Do NOT expect to see haste greater than 30% though as the devs believe it would be unbalancing.<br />
 <br />
Other effects, like fire damage focus for example, I do expect to see higher percentage focus effects on as well as having caps up to 75.<br />
 <br />
This is my impression of how things will work, please let me know if anything I am indicating is wrong.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
A bunch of us really busted our butts in the beta and on the beta forums trying to get things changed. We won a few and lost a few but the effort was huge. No one wants or expects a &quot;you guys are great&quot; post but please do not think that we love all the cuts or that we somehow let you all down.<br />
 <br />
IMHO the Cold Rain spell is a huge upgrade, the new heal is nice, the new bear pet will make it actually usefull (we got the bear pet changed at the last minute!) and we can now turn into a tree *smiles* Not all the spells or aa's are bad.<br />
 <br />
The devs were pretty open and honest to us and while we still have issues I am feeling pretty good about the expansion, the spells and our aa's. +6% to our dot crits will be huge IMHO. +6% to healing crits might make it crit enough to actually matter. We fought hard, and lost, on the healing adept line. We really tried but basically were told that it would raise Clerics healing too high. When we tried to suggest that they give it to the non-clerics as the other healing classes have been left behind a bit we did not get an answer.<br />
 <br />
The one issue that people may not know about is the nerf to Reptile. We really had to go to the carpet on this one. Apparently &quot;some&quot; druids but mostly other classes who have &quot;reptile like&quot; spells have been abusing the spell and pulling greens to a named in order to up the proc rate higher that the devs intended the spell to be. In addition we have some other classes that are &quot;very&quot; pissed about us using it to farm greens.<br />
 <br />
Let me tell you.... we had such a huge fight on our hands that it was all we could do to save Reptile and at the last minute at that. SOE still wants to change reptile but they tabled it for now.<br />
 <br />
The proposed fix was to nerf Reptile so it would proc more or less depending on the mobs con..... not at all for low level mobs and the standard rate for yellow-red mobs.... IE for day to day mobs the spell would have been nerfed.<br />
 <br />
Did we push for better heals, DPS, runspeed and others... you bet! Did we get them? Well IMHO we ended up better than most classes. Am I 100% happy.... of course not but I will leave you with one tidbit that you may not be aware of...<br />
 <br />
They will be removing our weak regen upgrade and replacing it with a spell that was axed. Dunno which it will be but this is what we were told.<br />
 <br />
Sorry if this post was a bit defensive in nature but after reading a few posts about rotten spells and beta people liking or not liking the list I just had to set the record straight.<br />

a few notes: <br />
<br />
-the 71 rain is on the same timer as the 66 rain .. probably as POP rain too. It stacks with the 850/wave rain spell though .. Not sure if it is worth casting both anymore as i used to with the 66 rain.<br />
<br />
-The Nature's beacon (71 charm spell) charms up to 70? quite nice to do at 71 then =) It describes as charming animals and insects .. so it has been expanded in the mob range it works with?</div></div><hr />

Aren't Dot's the most commonly cast spell in a druids spellbook, other than when on raids?  I can't remember the last time i cast a rain spell,  but i constantly use Heals, Regen, Seasons, DDs and Dots.<br />
<br />
We even get another charm to try and get ourselves killed with, instead of upgrades to DoTs.  It just seems weird which spells were pulled.  I was *really* looking forward to getting a new slate of DoTs, hopefully they'll reconsider.<br />
<br />
I can't really say that not having these dots lessens my enjoyment of the game, because we're being given 5 levels, AAs, and new spells, but it just seems odd to me.<br />
<br />
As an aside to this, can someone please educate me on when rain spells would be used in a solo, group, or raid situation?  I might just be missing the reason why this spell needs to exist.<br />

rains are the most efficient spell dps you have. 1460*3 = 4380. triple crit is 3358*3=10,074. stack it with winter's storm (850*3) and you are pumping out the dps.<br />

Pure Life is wrong. The links you have the ranks pointing to is correct, tho.<br />
Pure Life<br />

<br />
Rank III Druid Spells are received by rune turn in. Glowing Obsidian Runes (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=52676) drop from TSS raid mobs and are turned in to Kalim`Kar the Gold in Ashengate. He's just inside the zone, before the first big door you see, to the right and down a bit, hidden somewhat between the rocks @ n275 n100. The order of Rank III spells received is being compiled here (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=14538).</div></div><hr />

If you are fixing a car, and have to remove a bolt, you might use a socket wrench.  Someone else might use a open end wrench, someone else might use a closed end wrench, someone else might use an adjustable.  Who's right?  Dunno, so long as the car gets fixed.  <br />
 <br />
I don't use charm. I personally have no use for a new wolf form.  I am not going to begrudge a druid that wants better charms or a new wolf form.    In the extreme, it's like stating that I need a new Karana's Rage for quadding, so take away Karana's Renewal, cause I never use it. <br />
 <br />
In order to develop the class, we need to keep as many tools in our toolbox as we can, so that each of us can play the druid that we play.  Please don't be willing to sacrifice Charms, Harmonies, or Rains, because you primarily use Fire Nukes, DoTs and Heals.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Good Job!&quot; to you guys who did beta and provided honest, well thought feedback to the Devs.  And continue to fight for our Debuff lines, they are the best little known advantage of the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mage self-only mana regen buff (same slot as 9/dire, doesn't stack) scales from 10 to 12 mana regen from rk. I to rk. III -- so mages, for the first time to my knowledge, are now the superior slot 4 mana regen buffers.</div></div><hr />

Pre-mod melee hit * 1.0X (X=dmg buff mod %) = actual melee hit.<br />
<br />
So, if a person does 110 dps w/o damage mod buffs - 100 from raw melee, 10 from procs - they'll do 116 dps w/ mammoth rk 1.  It's a fixed effectivness, there is no 'roll' to determine how effective damage mod buffs on a given hit are.</div></div><hr />
