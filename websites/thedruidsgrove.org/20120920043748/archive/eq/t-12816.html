From what I understand this is only if maxed in both (GoM3 and AH5).<br />
One example I was gives was 1400 casts and no GoM fired.</div></div><hr />

however works just fine on nukes and dots for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kagonis</div><div class="date">01-16-2006, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought AH5 because rumors had it that the issue was fixed. However, this is not true :(<br />
I see GoM fire often for my nukes, never for my heal.<br />
Only time EVER I've seen AH5 fire was when using item heal (Kelp-Covered Hammer), and the reason for this I think, is that in previous patch SOE changed it so items no longer triggered GoM, that leaves them open to trigger AH instead.<br />
<br />
I think SOE should a) fix AH/GoM ASAP instead of putting out yet another expansion (unlikely since it's probably not something you just fix) or b) refund the AA's spent on AH and stop coming with the excuse that people would just buy it again. If that's so, then those people that are stupid enough to do so have only themselves to thank for it.</div></div><hr />

Since SoE seems more focused on putting out another expansion than fixing issues, I really think they need to refund the AH AAs and let us spend those elsewhere. I cannot believe after all this time they acknowledge an issue, tell us it is a deepseated core issue and they don't know how long til it's fixed and expect us to be happy with that response. If they refunded the AAs then perhaps we'd see GoM proc on heals. I feel like all of us who bought both AAs got cheated and SoE doesn't care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see nothing about it in their Developer's Corner.<br />
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=DevCorner&amp;page=1<br />
<br />
This should be a top priority for them, yet I don't even see it listed.<br />
<br />
Of course, Sony refuses to communicate with us so who knows?</div></div><hr />

Nice to know that at least Sony is aware of the problem.<br />
<br />
Now we only have to wait two or three years and it will be fixed (maybe).</div></div><hr />

I didnt find out about this issue until after the double xp weekend when I finally bought that piece of crap AH5.  I waited til I had nothing else to buy and boy am I sorry.  My heals never proc GoM and PoR has done nothing to fix it.  I petitioned/bugged and will continue to do so til they get off their lazy asses and refund our AA's or fix it.  Ive read the lame excuse they put out and its just that, LAME.  I should have just bought more tradeskill aa's.  Oh well. Enough venting from me.<br />

&quot;You have been refunded 5 AA points of the alternate ability Abundant Healing.&quot;<br />

So... at least if they can't fix it they finally refunded it.  This is on Test but I'm guessing it would go live next patch.  I'm just thrilled they did something. :)</div></div><hr />

GoM is maximum 3, AH is maximum 5 ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, the bug is (was), that if you have both GoM and AH, whichever with the highest rank (since it's considered a focus, apparently from the same line) will fire (if anything fires). So because your GoM was higher than  your AH you still get GoM on your heals, but would then not get any AH. At least that's how I understand the dev reply in the post mentioned at the beginning (post 5 or something) of this thread.</div></div><hr />
