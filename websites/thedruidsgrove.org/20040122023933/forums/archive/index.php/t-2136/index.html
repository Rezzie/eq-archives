<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>casualeq1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for a 65 druid pulling Phinny.<br />
<br />
Will have a 65 cleric and 65 warrior for the actual fight but I was wondering on pull strategies with the annoying cheal seahorses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kendali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">use a stalking probe or something to pretarget phinny<br />
<br />
swim over the center and pull him with ensnare<br />
<br />
pull him and all his little horsie friends to a corner up top away from the main ledge<br />
<br />
exodus to safety<br />
<br />
the horsies will swim home to spawn point and phinny will be nice and alone where you pulled him because he can't swim away being snared...go back down and kill him and loot =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SilleyEskimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just used innate camo and pulled the horses 2 at a time.  We just killed him last week with a 63 druid, 65 cleric, and 65 monk pretty easily.  When it came time for phinny himself, I just used Command of Tunare on a seahorse and killed the add with him, then sent him in to help finish off Phinny.<br />
<br />
Cleric finished with 80 mana, and I had 90.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kendali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">eye of zomm and eye of tallon can't swim...but they run at selo's speed under water...you can drop it off the ledge and get to phinny and look around to get a target =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">65 druid, 65 cleric, 65 warrior? Just fight him in his lair. Easy. The 65 druid could probably solo him, actually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, if by selo's speed you mean slower than an orc pawn, yeah.<br />
<br />
They swim maybe as fast as a level 1 human.  Although they can go normal speed on the z axis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting note...<br />
Calm Animal works indoors on animals up to level 50.<br />
:)  <br />
<br />
If none of the swirlspines see invis, I just invis and swim down into the hole, find phinigel, pick a nearby cubby in the wall and pull to there.  Usually I get no adds.  Sometimes I get one, in which case I just channel egress and try again (I try to save exodus for when an actual fight goes bad).<br />
<br />
Now that I discovered Calm Animal works indoors, I can deal with swirlspines that see invis too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kendali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok if you insist they can't run off the ledge at superspeed and drop down to see phinny up and target him, i'll let it go but i've personally watched my wizard friend do it every time we killed him for his epic which was over 10 times...me and him and a ranger /shrug (btw i know it goes superfast because we played games with it to pass the time waiting for him to spawn a time or two...wizard would try to get the eye to outrun the ranger's arrows or we'd try to get a melee swing off as it ran by us hehe)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Try summoning an eye (hi stalking probes) underwater.  It can go up/down (z axis) fast, but if you try to move on the x/y axis it goes snail speed.  What you said implies he summoned it over at the edge then let it drop down; Z axis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kendali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">no he would run it around the ledge (extends in a circle around the room) and we'd play our &quot;try to shoot/slash the eye&quot; game and it moved at superspeed (on the x-y plane)<br />
