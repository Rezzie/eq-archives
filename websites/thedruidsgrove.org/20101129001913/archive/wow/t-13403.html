<br />
i've only used starfall on bosses - i guess due to not wanting to put out to much threat if hurricane is already running and the fact its 1.5 min CD and i was 'saving' it for something !<br />
<br />
now i've glyphed it so its only a 1 min cd and i use it as often as i can on large trash pulls - 3/4 mobs.<br />
<br />
also used it doing some daiilys where i pul as many mobs as possible, max of 6 usually doing the Blood of the Chosen, barkskin, starfall, hurriance and watch em all die :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find an area where several herde's of beasts gather (BT or HF) and then Starfall and run in circles to get as much aggro on as many as possible, then barksin/Hurricane them all down.  Heal up, loot, skin, and all your cooldowns are ready to go again!!!<br />
<br />
Can normally kill 20+ mobs in one hurricane!</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah i used to look at mages and think OP &gt; nerf !  when i'd see em run around on horse pulling millions then just shield and aeo them all down.<br />
<br />
now i can do it :)<br />
<br />
its also ofc adding more dps to me in heroics :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have used it for dailies, but discovered (rather indelicately) that aggroing an entire zone isn't a good idea for someone who's used to being a tree.  <br />
<br />
I guess you could say my Boomkin survival skills need work.  <br />

:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
we pulled a grp and i thought ok starfall time......<br />
<br />
oooops...<br />
<br />
i pulled another 3 as well who i thought were a long way away from me :shuffle: <br />
<br />
quickly follwed by my death.....then someone else managed to back away and pulled another grp of 3....<br />
<br />
/WIPE !<br />
<br />
<br />
hehe its good for dailies to......max HP, cast a regrowth, aggro as many as possible with starfall, use barkskin, hurricane to death and loot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">06-05-2009, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe loving using starfall and hurricane farming some shoveltusk meat.<br />

<br />
i've got used to using in heroics more and more. esp a damage boost if we are running with low dps although i've never really looked at how mnuch damage/dps it does for in the course of a heroic run.<br />
<br />
and although its deep in the balance tree i dint find that a problem and its only a 1 point talent if memory serves....<br />
<br />
beng able to use it once a minute is great.</div></div><hr />
