I don't have any of my solo gear enchanted or inscripted or anything yet.  I was curious if anyone else has found nifty gear that makes their balance points sing when they solo?<br />
<br />
I have noticed that things are dying a LOT faster since I started acquiring a bit of moonkin gear.</div></div><hr />

But in the bank I have ...<br />

- boomkin legs from 1st ZA chest<br />
- spell damage ring from one of the avatars in ZA (I forget which one)<br />
- bracers from Attumen (there may be something better out there ... but I got these for free, so why not?)<br />
<br />
which are part of my &quot;damage&quot; set (otherwise I just keep my healing gear equipped).  I was also thinking of getting the Ogri'la OH as well since it's free (I already have the Apexis Crystals in the bank).</div></div><hr />

Cool!  I'll have to see if I can get the Ogrila OH.  I've been using the one from Nightbane or was it Netherspite?  It spits fire.<br />
<br />
I wonder if there's any AH gear that would be good for soloing?</div></div><hr />
