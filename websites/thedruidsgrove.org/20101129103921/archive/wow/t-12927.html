What do you guys think of the healing touch glyph?  It speeds it up quite a bit, but cuts the heal in half.<br />
<br />
&quot;Use: Decreases the cast time of Healing Touch by 1.5 sec., the mana cost by 25%, and the amount healed by 50%.&quot;</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I'm waiting to see some numbers on it, or hear some reactions from people who tried it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm wondering if HT is the new Lifebloom. It would have get a significant boost from spellpower over other healing spells for that glyph to make any sense whatsoever...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about it.  It almost becomes a flash heal then, but that leaves you without any big heals.  So you'd have to rely on extensive use of HoTs as well as rapid fire HT use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with Allahanstar,<br />
<br />
You are killing the only big heal left for druids, and its cost mana efficiency.  50% the cast time, 50% the heal, @ 75% of the cost....somthing sounds a little funny??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see it being really nice if it just reduces the base heal amount by 50%, but still applies the base +heal (or spellpower) coefficient now.<br />
 <br />
Average base heal for rank 13 HT is ~2500, and the cast time of 3.0 sec base means that it gets a lot of the bonus spellpower, So if the spell is reduced by ~1250 but still keeps the base coefficient, it could be a really strong 'flash'<br />
 <br />
Good point about taking away the one true big heal.  <br />
 <br />
Hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">10-21-2008, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">does it cut a crit by 50% as well?<br />
<br />
if you're critting with HT fairly often, then it might be worth it, too... and i imagine it would also lower healing threat if the big heal isn't as big...<br />
<br />
im still trying to wrap my brain around it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing theat is simply amount of HP replaced with your heal(over healing = 0 threat).  It doesn't matter if you hit them with 2k health in one hit or 1k health 2 times, its the same threat.<br />
<br />
Some would argue that the heal is spread over more time, but I would say it is not.  Your 2k cast is 3 secs, your 1k's are 1.5 secs, so the tank has the same amount of time to build hate.</div></div><hr />

Every tank that I've talked to has said that tanking is really cake right now, with all the aoe type spells, threat isn't much of an issue.  <br />
 <br />
I'm sure that will change with LK, when we aren't fighting severely nerfed mobs in all the 5 and 10 mans.</div></div><hr />

care to elaborate Mag, i'm not sure on your views of it from such a brief posting....<br />
<br />
;) <br />
<br />
<br />
tbh i've been somewhat underwhelmed by them to now. maybe i expected more or simply too much but i'm not impressed by any of the feral ones i've seen although i'm sure some are good for some specs and esp for people who are raiders... ?<br />
<br />
for the bit of pvp i do the dash cooldown maybe useful and i think there is one to extend the duration of rip ??<br />
<br />
i did buy the maul one last night to try but need to see if it affecting 2 targets is a problem for me with cc'd mobs in 5 mans.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thorns and minor rebirth glyphs are nice as well.<br />
<br />
I suspect we will start to see uber glyphs in LK, as all of the new major glyphs have to be discovered (rather than vendor trained).  I'm hoping we get some sort of boost to thorns damage to help with AoE tanking a bit.</div></div><hr />
