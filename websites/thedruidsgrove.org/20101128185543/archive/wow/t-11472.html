That is how I put the original WoW on my laptop.</div></div><hr />

We had this problem also. Older computer loaded fine. <br />
<br />
Solution: Copied discs to a file on an older computer then using the shared file, copied then loaded them fine onto the newer (2 yrs old) computer that would not recognize the discs.<br />
<br />
For 99% (second hand info) the download worked smooth.  A big hats off, again, to Blizzard for a well made and enjoyable product.  <br />
<br />
Had this been SOE, it would have been weeks of patches to fix the patches that broke the patches until, sorry no more fixes until we have the next release out.  Then the broken,  well, everything gets filed away never to be looked at again.<br />

The best part of EverQuest was quitting it.</div></div><hr />
