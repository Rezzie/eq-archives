 <br />
i dont feel we gained much by this spell.. ide rather see a bigger mana hit and a bigger heal with a longer recast if they are teasing us with some kind of new big heal.... totally toned down desperate renewel if you ask me....<br />
 <br />
not to mention the focii loss we have atm even using it.<br />

<br />
1.95 second cast time reduction.<br />
<br />
With a cast time of only 1.8 seconds, thats pretty much godly fast for druids.  Its not meant to be used a lot or in place of Pure Life.  Its an emergency fast heal when your tank, or caster, is going down fast and you need to drop *something* on them.  Obviously, this probably isnt going to help much if you are the only healer in the group or something.  But its meant to be an emergency patch heal while something larger gets put on.<br />
<br />
In other words, its to be used in conjunction with our other heals and other healers.  Its value is in its speed, not its efficency or hps healed.  Its very situational and not meant to be used a lot.<br />
<br />
That said, I like it.  I'd like it even more, however, if it came with a seperate spell slot or was an AA or something...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It trades mana efficancy for raw speed.  Also all ranks of it have a 30% chance to proc a 10% 2000 Damage Rune which lasts for 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">09-23-2006, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hit 75 today and been testing both Pure Life and Adrenalin Surge, main healing a 4-person group in Direwind. First I was worried how efficient AS would be with my heal focus (Anguish boots, 45% up to 70), but seems I was critting about the same amount than with both Pure Life and Ancient Chloro: 9k-10.8k. Will be nice when I get second rank for both spells. <br />
<br />
I am pleased with the fast cast time and 15 second recast time didn't bother at all, just used it as combo with Pure Life. It also seemed to proc rather often and tank in my group was happy. Didn't affect my mana pool much, all our heals have always taken a lot of mana to cast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ieglawen</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have ancient Chloro and a bunch of gear with focus effects up to level 70. I don't think purelife is going to be much use for me. My focus effects start to lose 10% per level after 70, and ancient chloro vs pure life is about a wash in the healing before the focus losses. I understand that there are 2 more levels for this spell which will eventually make this barely useful, but not now for a raiding druid till focus effects are above 71.<br />
<br />
For those that don't have access to ancient runes, I guess they win with a store bought spell. /shrug.<br />
<br />
IMO a CH spell that hits for more than 5990 would be far more useful for those rare times we get stuck in a chain. But I didn't beta this expansion, so I guess I have to room to complain.</div></div><hr />

I had a lot of opportunity to try it tonight, in a group with way too many adds and many near death situations. It's a great emergency heal, I love the fast cast.</div></div><hr />
