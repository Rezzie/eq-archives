I was just wondering If any one could tell me what they are called, where you get them and any differences from a normal mount.  Thanks on advance!</div></div><hr />

There are one or two legendary bug mounts on each server from the AQ opening event (needed to turn in sceptre of the shifting sands for it), it can be used outside AQ and is instant cast rather than 3 sec.</div></div><hr />
