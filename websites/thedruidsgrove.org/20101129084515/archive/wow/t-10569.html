I solo'd the first 11 or so steps last night, and am now at the part that is a (raid) quest.  I read all about it on thott, but was wondering if any fellow TDG'ers had any tips.<br />
<br />
Cant wait for the Ring of Protection.  150ac and 9sta on a ring.  /drool.</div></div><hr />

We had 30 some people and it really didn't last long.  From what I remember you really don't need that many at all and could probably 5 man it if you all were well equipped enough.  I have to hit this quest here soon too.</div></div><hr />

I got 7 or 9 people to help out and no one was epic geared.  There were alot of deaths... but the good news is the GY is right there' so you can run back to your corpse rather quickly.<br />
<br />
From what I recall... you have spawns in waves from your North and East.  You have to keep the one guy alive, and kill the main bad guy... I can't rember their names.  I don't believe you can heal the NPC's so you want a tank pick'n up anything that attacks your friendly npcs.<br />
<br />
I dunno if that helps... I still wear the Neck in my heal gear and the Ring in my tank gear... so it's worth getting done.</div></div><hr />

Probably cause I was healing :P  Fun quest.  I am keeping the offhand to swap out with my lorespinner/milli's lexicon for the FR.  Vendored the neck, as the tooth of gnarr / Ony attune neck / Emberfury Talisman are better.  LOVE the ring.  Finally broke 10,000 armor in bear form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah,  We easily did it with 6.  Certainly could have completed with 5.  Makes me wonder why Blizz refers to it as a Raid quest...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's marked as a raid because it can actually be completed and turned in as a raid.</div></div><hr />
