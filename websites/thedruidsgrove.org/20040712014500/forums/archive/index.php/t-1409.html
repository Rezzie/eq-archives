<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vetoafauna</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost every day we face mobs with certain immunities, be it immune to change in run speed, attack speed, charm, or whatever. Since circle buffs have grown more and more absolete as less mobs require fire/cold resistance and resistance, in general, makes only marginal difference, what about a line buffs that would grant immunity to a certain status effect? ie, buffs that would make the target immune to fear, change in run/attack speed, charm, blind, whatever. Here's the catch though, none of these buffs would stack with each other. So you cannot be immune to snare and slow at the same time, only one per situation. There are certain encounters out there that these would be made alot easier by atm but i dont think it'd really  trivialize anything. Anyhow, just a thought :p   My other thought is a buff that would add fire or cold elemental damage to the targets weapons (even if it doesn't read on the weapon). Cast it on a ranger using earthcaller and what used to be 14/24 now hits like 14/24+3cold damage. Rather than another attack buff that surely wouldnt stack with avatar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ie: if you went to do gore immune to slow, the biggest problem with her would be that she CHs which means little really.  Grp immunes to fear would take out a lot of the risk from encounters... I'm sure there are a bunch more.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't shoot for new abilities... our problem now is that we have so many abilities but almost all of them can be done better by others when needed.  Any new abilities would have to also be sub par or they'd just be overpowering.</div></div><hr />
