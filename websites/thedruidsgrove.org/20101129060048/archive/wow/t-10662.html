<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">06-01-2006, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So.. Im no experienced WoW, and definately not PvP.<br />
<br />
But I just recieved my Private rank, and I wish to share the 3 kills I got yesterday.<br />
<br />
Number 1 (Warlock - lvl26)<br />
<br />
I know Warlock's are pretty bad ass in PvP. But when I was travelling to Stonetalon Mountains I saw a 25 Warlock up the road (Im 22 NE druid going for 0/30/21 spec). So I cloaked right away - and when he got abit down the road I could see he was without his pet. I though this was an oppertune moment, so he waited until he passed me - rooted him - Feral charge - stepped back - Moonfire - Catform, and really ganked him, I lost about 100Hp total.. Fun kill :D<br />
<br />
Number 2 (Warrior - lvl25)<br />
<br />
Farely easy and right away fight.. Saw the dude, cloaked myself (in catform) - stepped up behind him and gave him a couple attack before chaning into Bear and no problem there.<br />
<br />
Number 3 (Rouge - lvl23)<br />
<br />
This was just to easy I think.. I was in normal form, saw the dude - rooted him - moonfire - changed to Bear and got him to about 20% healt before I went to catform and finished him. He did some more dmg on me - I had about 50% when I was done (no healings).<br />
<br />
<br />
So, just these 3 last kills I got last night made me love my druid even more. I know if I had met the Warlock with his pet I would be in trouble, but hey.. He's the one not running around with it ;)<br />
<br />
So with my druid I have yet to lose a PvP fight against a Horde above lvl 26 wich is pretty cool since I am 4 lvl under.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, I hit 24 last night - but killed while I was in 22/23. <br />
Pardon my english ;)<br />

They can lock you up pretty good, but once you get the NS you'll have an edge.  Make sure you faerie fire them.  If they can't vanish, they lose a major tool.<br />
<br />
The warlock, yeah, had his succubus been out you would have gone to sleep and he would have his way with you after he feared you.<br />
<br />
Warrior?  Fight fight fight, bash, root, step back to heal, then fight fight fight some more.  Should be able to outlast him.  Later on though, warriors become very mean and can mortal strike you which makes it very hard to heal yourself well.<br />
<br />
The wins are great.  And losing can be a heavy hit to the moral.  Druids can adjust so well to most situations though.  Grats on your wining streak!</div></div><hr />

First encountered a 24 mage and took him with no trouble, then 22 Hunter, same. I was in cat all the time, prowling. Lots of horde there. I was 21 at time. I decided to sneak past Worlock (26) and a Rouge (also 26) that were passing. <br />
<br />
Looking at your post, I regret not hawing tried to take them down as well. Next time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i myself just had some very nice kills in the battlegrounds last night. i just made lvl 26 and got dash. i am working on feral spec...of course.... so to the point, i took out a 29 warlock in 3 seconds flat, got charged by a warriar (i just waited for daze to expire and didnt shapeshift) then proceeded to rip his guts out....he was 29 as well. then i proweled into enemy side and killed a 28 druid(i think he was balance speced because ummm he was just TRYING to hit me w/ spells....) gaurding the flag. i took it, had help from another druid :texla:  leaving their fort, we ummm SMOKED a 29 pali, then i basically dashed the whole middleground, when i got to my fort entrence our flag was taken, he actually ran the same route i was goin, we engaged and it was flag on flag (got to love it) 1 vs 1 , do or die, i umm ripped his guts out too  :) and returned the flag to end the battle.  in the end, in 2 battles i only died once and got 34 kills and about 20 more assists.  :buttrock:  i am in love with feral.  :buttrock:</div></div><hr />

Sure is fun.. I hit 28 yesterday, (very close to 29).  Cant wait to hit 30 to get travel form and lots more!<br />
<br />
I to love my 0/31/20 build.. It feels like a really survivor, even at my level. And that way you can take a crap load of damage, and still get to full health pretty damn fast.. Man I love my druid! :D<br />
<br />
gwmort - yeah gotta get some Green Whelp Armor.. Do they drop in any spec instance? Or is it just as good to get one at AH?<br />

<br />
Im lvl 35 now, I took on a 32 Priest and a 32 Rogue yesterday. I just focused on the priest , and by the time the priest was dead the rogue had already been sleeping 2 times :)<br />
<br />
Then it was just to entagle him and throw a starfire and back to bear and finish the f**** off :)<br />
<br />
Green Whelp Armor FTW!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brekster</div><div class="date">06-26-2006, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah its good. Though I wish the armor had some +Str on it. At my lvl I find it my Str is abit low - I have good Sta and Agi but...<br />
<br />
Can anyone share how much +abilities they have at lvl 60? Or at 35 if they remember :)<br />
<br />
I think I have about 30 +/- in Str, but well over 40 on both Agi and Sta..<br />
<br />
