<br />
Refer to the below quoted terms of service from Blizzard regarding the language/communication we should use with other users while playing the game.<br />
<br />
Quoting from the Terms of Service:<br />
<br />
&quot;Rules Related to &quot;Chat&quot; and Interaction With Other Users...<br />
<br />
...Transmit or post any content or language which, in the sole and absolute discretion of Blizzard, is deemed to be offensive, including without limitation content or language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable, nor may you use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the content and language restrictions listed above;&quot;<br />
<br />
Now with the coming voice chat should Blizzard regulate the language?  (Can they even regulate it?)<br />
<br />
Why bind us to this contract if they aren't going to enforce it (or can't enforce it)?  Doesn't it seem a little silly to have a 'law' without someone to enforce it?<br />
<br />
For those who like to be vulgar/sexual/racist/etc: Why use this kind of language with complete strangers anyways even if it's not in the terms of service?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">09-04-2007, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it's silly, but contracts are always laden with clauses that the parties have no intention of enforcing. The language clause in Blizzard's TOS is there as a legal protection in case 1) they ever feel the need to enforce it and 2) to serve as a minor (and ineffective) safeguard against plaintiffs who might object to abusive or obscene langauge. I doubt Blizzard intends to listen in on any of our conversations unless a problem is brought to their attention, ie, somebody gets reported. Even then, enforcement will be problematic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
voice comms is a non stop issue, have used it for over the last 5-6 years maybe longer.<br />
<br />
you get alot of arguements, bad language, stupid people causing issues..<br />
<br />
never use desktop speakers with a mic.. your family and those around will be a big issue... and headsets are a worse issue<br />
(this all based on someone being married or kids or both)<br />
<br />
voice coms is also very easy to hack and that is a favorite of kids that get mad and want revenge.<br />
<br />
blizzard themselves i doubt will ever show themselves as a blizz rep in a voice chat anywhere.  well not if they have any common sense cause they will be assualted by massive morons just because they can</div></div><hr />

It will also be nice for those very small family-like groups and/or for those 2-3 players groups that quest together who typically don't have access to a larger Guild's voice setup.<br />
<br />
I have a co-worker (and his family) that play together using their cell phones.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to have to give out TS info for your guild's server, you can just use the in game chat function.  Some fights work a lot better when you can give verbal directions instead of wasting 10 minutes typing them out.</div></div><hr />
