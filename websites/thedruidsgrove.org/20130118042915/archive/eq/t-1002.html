Since the epic came out it seems somehow people can end up dumping the oddest factions!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I killed xxx mob and lost xxx faction and I cannot complete my epic quest!&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean giving you a spell called scoriae/wildfire allows you to burn everything in your way?  Isn't there at least a little bit of common roleplaying here?  I mean do you really want to go out and torch Kelethin and then come running here to find out uber_01_way_to_fix_your_faction_in_2_seconds00!<br />
<br />
Get a clue.  Don't burn everything that comes across your path because someday, for some odd reason (maybe your epic?), you might have a use for it.</div></div><hr />

I can't play EQ like Quake?<br />

After she loots the piece, she mentions that she went on PoG raids and is now KOS.<br />

This wood elf thought she was fine because she had already done the first part of her epic.<br />

We all make some mistakes though, like when Velious came out I went to Skyshrine and helped with a few mobs (thankfully just a handfull).  Later I regretted being KOS to dragons and rebuilt it over a long period of time hunting giants.<br />
<br />
However, I can't see how anyone could expect to regain faction with Tunare when they kill their own goddess's creatures in her home.  If it is recoverable at all, it should require the equivalent of an epic quest to recover up to dubious, then perhaps some factioning by killing creatures and minor quests to raise it after that.  I wish the system was complex enough to allow an increase or reduction in your power based upon your faction with your own diety.  That would certainly stop Tunarean druids from hunting PoG.</div></div><hr />

That certainly is the roleplay way to do it, and it might even force some of the l33t arses out of our class. And i have a similar persepective on Kael giants. Any roleplaying druid should be bothered that they are tearing up Waking Lands and turning it into a stripmall...</div></div><hr />

You can't expect people to roleplay when VI does NOTHING to favour roleplay ? Man, how many times was I bored because guild was doing PoG and attempting Tunare but I couldn't because I still haven't completed my friggin' epic ... Tunare worshippers are the only ones that get &quot;punished&quot; for worshipping their god ... they can't kill mobs in PoG, they can't kill Tunare and there is no loot for them. Do Cazic worshippers get punished for killing in Fear ? Inny worshippers for killing in Hate ? So, please, stop that roleplay BS. <br />
If VI did correctly their job, factions would be something really important in everyday's gaming not only for 1 or 2 quests.</div></div><hr />
