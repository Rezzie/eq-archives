<br />
His mortal strike does too much damage to me how can i counter this?<br />
<br />
I also think its partly because hes just better than me, my talents are 31/20 balanced/gimp<br />
<br />
how can such a druid improve?</div></div><hr />

The best druids I know as well as myself use Restoration builds.  The power of the druid is within survivability.  W/O Rejuvinate and Regrowth, I dont see how we could win anything.</div></div><hr />

And keeping the warrior away from you initially helps, those melee abilities of theirs come through in a pinch when you least expect em too.  I had a Warrior one-shot me down to less than a quarter heal from full.  Rooting initially (thanks to diminishing returns it wont be as effective), then HoT yourself and tank em with Bear.  I might throw up Barkskin first then switch and tank em with Frenzied Regen as well.  If you need to heal again stun them, shift out and heal up (with the 4 second stun if you spec for it helps a lot when you need to heal midfight.).  <br />
<br />
I never really have problems with Warriors.  Don't ever use Catform against them outside of opener otherwise you are asking them to kill you.</div></div><hr />

I'm on a PvE server, but I have been dueling a lot lately (what else is there to do?) and I would classify myself as a mediocre dueler. I win more than I lose, but I RARELY lose to a warrior unless they get lucky. Use Nature's Grasp, get a regrowth/rejuv up, barkskin, bear form and go to town.</div></div><hr />

Undoubtably because he got it as a drop and it was better than what he had.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mythrus</div><div class="date">04-25-2005, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely with hertzsae, you need to be liberal in your use of mana against a warrior. I lost today against a warrior two levels above me because I thought I could safely get below 25% without being in danger of getting finished off. <br />
<br />
When in bear form I bashed and rooted so that I could get in a healing touch, but he had his anti-root boots ready, so he broke out of root and finished me off. I ended the fight with full mana.<br />
<br />
Anyway, use rejuv/regrowth instead of root/healing touch unless you know the opponent isn't likely to break out of root. If you have nature's swiftness you could get away with breaking out of bear form without a stun and just insta healing, saving bash for later.</div></div><hr />
