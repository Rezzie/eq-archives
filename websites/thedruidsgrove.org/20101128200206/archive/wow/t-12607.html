<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandrius</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all,<br />
<br />
New to this forum, returning WoW player. I recently started a druid, I think I'm about 13 right now, but I guess it's never too early to start thinking about the future eh?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I was reading the talent breakdown on WoWWikki and this is the build I came up with. My primary focus will be PVE solo/group/raid. My thoughts are to cat in solo, and preferably tank in group/raid, unless dps is needed (which based on past experience, most groups are high on dps and low on tankage, unless that's changed recently).<br />
<br />
My Build (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?tal=000000000000000000000553232132322  10530120155003001000000000000)<br />
<br />
Ok, prob here is that I have one little dangling point lol. It may sound silly, but I don't know where to stick it! (Wow did I leave myself open on that one! :nerd: ) Any suggestions here? Is this an OK build for what I'm looking for? Any tips on progression (i.e. which talents I should go for first)?<br />
<br />
And my question about gear is: Will I need a seperate set of gear for tanking and dps/solo? I'm not 100% sure how stats are played out when in different forms (do I need high agi when in cat? High stam/str when in bear? does it matter?)<br />
<br />
Sorry for so many questions! I've read a few druid guides but they mostly explain what a druid is/does and don't go into much detail about the mechanics.<br />
<br />
Any help here would be wonderful.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

<br />
Drop Improved mark of the wild.  Let a resto druid take it.  Besides, it really isn't that big of a buff.<br />
<br />
Drop Feral Aggression -- bite isn't a lot of your dps in cat form (if it is even used) and the debuff boost is minor<br />
<br />
Pick-up Predatory Instincts -- more dps<br />
<br />
Consider dropping natural shapeshifter.  It is primarily a PvP talent though it does serve a purpose in high-end kitty raid dps (power shifting).<br />
<br />
Consider picking up Naturalist and maybe Intensity</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandrius</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent, thank you for those tips, they make perfect sense.<br />
<br />
I've made the changes you suggested, here's where I'm at:<br />
<br />
My Build 2.0 (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?tal=000000000000000000000503232132322  10530125105500301000000000000)<br />
<br />
Still have a dangling point. I was thinking about throwing it into natures grasp as it's the only 1-point talent left to me, but it seems like it's very limited (only used outdoors). Is there another talent that would be more beneficial with even just a single point?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with tlbj in general on his talent suggestions.  <br />
- drop Imp Mark<br />
- drop feral aggression<br />
- pick up naturalist &amp; predatory instincts ( more dmg )<br />
<br />
Yes, you will want separate gear for tanking, for dps'ing, for healing and for pvp.<br />
<br />
healing you'll focus on +heal, spirit, int, mp5<br />
tanking - stam ( more stam and more stam ), def ( to 415 assuming you keep Survival of the Fittest  ), armor, agility <br />
dps - atk power/str, agi, crit, and a smattering of hit<br />
pvp - resilience + whatever for your spec ( healing or dps )<br />
<br />
I'm sure some will disagree with me =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandrius</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow! Didn't realize druids were so needy lol!<br />
<br />
Another thought just occurred to me though. Should I only worry about gear sets when I'm 70? Can I get away with 1-70 focusing on just one set?<br />
<br />
I appreciate the input here, however this is my only char on this server, and as such I have no ability to twink myself. Plus, with decent level progression I'm generally switching out gear every 5-7 levels or so, unless I get something REALLY good at low level. Should I just wait until end-game to worry about it?<br />
<br />
Oh, and what's mp5 mean?<br />
<br />
Thanks :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far (62) I've kept a feral (melee dps/tank) set and a healing set while leveling.  There have been a few pieces that I'd swap out to DPS or to Tank, but overall those functions overlap.  A lot.<br />
<br />
If you were going Balance or Resto -I know, you aren't- those tend to have a lot of overlap as well, so still, a caster set and a feral set.  There doesn't seem to be much of anything Balance pre-BC that isn't also good for Resto too.  or perhaps that's more appropriate the other way around.  Anyhow...<br />
<br />
The short answer?  You should be ok with two sets of gear up to 60ish.</div></div><hr />

You should be ok with two sets of gear up to 60ish.That's what I did.  As a leveling Feral, I was wearing my Kitty set, and kept a few 4-8 healing pieces in my bags (not sure I ever used them) along with a few high +sta or high +armor pieces in case I needed to tank pre-Outland (I never did).<br />
<br />
Now I carry 3.5 sets with me at all times.  Kitty (wearing), Bear (1-2 pieces overlap with kitty), Healing (full set, no overlap) and PvP (several pieces overlap with my kitty/bear stuff).  It all fits in 2 18 slot bags.  Plus 2 slots in my backpack ('cause I just picked up my SSO neck pieces but they are special use, so I need the extra space).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dandrius</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm guessing that gear sets are something akin to guns: better to have one and not need it than need one and not have it?<br />
<br />
If in a group, I would definately prefer to tank, however I can see where being prepared for every scenario is a good thing, however I can't really see this as practical, and believe me I'm not arguing with you guys, I just don't see how this could work!<br />
<br />
I have a high-level friend who spotted me 5 gold when I first started. I spent most of that on bags knowing that the more you can carry, the more you eventually make, especially when you're new to the server and don't have a high-level alt to twink/farm for you. I took leatherworking/skinning so I could help myself out with gear during my formitive years, as I can't see myself being able to do much AHing until much later.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to get at is, even if I could come across enough gear to make all these sets, I certainly don't have the bag space to spare carrying them around all the time with me, and even if I did, that would severely limit my potential for making money and improving my lot.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could keep my spare sets in the bank and run to town whenever a group situation came about, as I generally don't join groups unless I'm specifically looking for a particular quest/instance run, but I could see even that becoming somewhat of a nuisance.<br />
<br />
Also, is it acceptable to roll on healing gear in a group when you're the tank? Or to roll on DPS gear when you're healing? Are druids kind of allowed to get away with that because they need all this gear?<br />
<br />
To be honest, I was really kind of digging the whole druid thing. I really like the fact that I can have a different &quot;class&quot; whenever I decide to switch forms, however I'm not sure if I'm going to like the upkeep/cost of playing one. Are druids entirely gear-dependent?<br />
<br />
I suppose it could be argued that all classes are, to an extent, &quot;gear-dependent&quot;, however this seems like a bit much :D<br />
<br />
I apologize if this post comes off as whiney or ranty, it wasn't my intention. I'm really just hoping that someone can either validate my assumptions/observations, and possibly give me some advice on how to overcome what I see as shortcomings, or maybe perhaps I should pick another class?<br />
<br />
Again, I respect those of you who play druids, and I very much appreciate all the tips and advice you have given me, however I'm still &quot;young&quot; enough to restart with a different char, perhaps one more suited to someone starting over from scratch on a new server.<br />
<br />
Thanks, as always, for any and all advice, and perhaps even if I do decide to go for a different class, maybe I'll stop in here from time to time to check on things. So far this is one of the most civilized and mature forums dealing with WoW that I've come across, so thank you!<br />

I ask.  &quot;This would be nice for my healing kit, if no one else wants it?  100% of the time, they let me have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Back to your gear question...don't worry about bag space too much.  It is not as bad as it sounds.  While leveling feral, the chances that you will accumulate that much healing gear is minimal until you reach the outlands.  Like you I had starter money (from an alt).  So, with 5 16-slot bags.  I had my backpack full of must haves (hearth stone, mount, pick, heal/mana potions, food, water, reagents, etc.)  And 1 16-slot bag filled with my &quot;healing kit&quot; and 3-5 other pieces.<br />
<br />
Now, once i reached the outlands, my healing kit grew because often the quest rewards are such that sometimes the kitty/bear reward isn't much of an upgrade, so I take the healing item.<br />
<br />
Now I have 4 18-slot bags (plus the 16-slot backpack).  2 are filled with bear, pvp and healing set.  ~6 slots in a 3rd bag are filled with scrolls, special food, etc.  That leaves me with 18+12 == 30 slots free for questing, mining and herbalism.  Bag space is rarely an issue for me.  Every time i stopped by the bank (usually right before i log off for the night) i empty my stacks of gathered items and vendor my extra greens.<br />
<br />
Honestly, how often you think you are going to so far from your bank that you can hearth back, clear your bags and run into that 5-man someone wants you to tank?  Not very often.<br />
<br />
One more thing, as a feral I have used my healing kit 3 times (1 BF run, 1 RP run and 2 minutes to get my swift flight form).  But I carry it all the time (not sure why).  If bag space became an issue, I'd just leave that bag in the bank.  And grab it if it was needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks so much for that, I totally forgot about quest rewards. I guess being a druid isn't so bad after all, and I'll give it an honest shot.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who have dilligently answered my extremely newbish questions :) I have a lvl 70 troll rogue on another server, but I have never taken another class past 40, and this is my first druid I think I've ever played.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it's really not a big deal to maintain two basic 'sets' at pre-BC levels.  I don't believe I've ever bought an off spec item from the AH, only kept what random drops I ran across or got as a quest reward. And from 58-63 it seems to be even easier in Outlands to get gear for your main set and an off-spec set without going out of your way.<br />
<br />
Bag space is more of an issue with a gathering profession like skinning, but I've gotten in the habit of making a bank/AH alt and whenever my characters are near a mailbox they dump every trade good and item that will sell on the AH to that alt.  That usually ends up freeing enough to keep me questing for another hour or two.<br />
<br />
For me, the biggest argument for keeping a fairly current off spec set is that I never settle on a spec - Rhus was Balance up  until about 49, then Feral to 63, and I'm planning on respeccing Resto/Balance at 64 - when Lifebloom becomes available.  At least I always have the gear to support my latest whim... :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think I started to collect healing gear until I was in my 50s.  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about looking at picking up healing gear until you're 60+ and pick up what you can from quests and instances that nobody else wants along the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have one other gear-related question that I didn't think required it's own thread. My question is about weapons and their effect while in forms. Does the damage of the weapon you carry have any effect on the damage you do in bear/kitty? What about the weapon speed? Would it be better to use 2h weapons high in damage or quicker 1h weapons that do more dps?<br />
<br />
If anyone can explain how weapons factor in to animal form, or show me a resource that does, I'd be very grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Attack speeds in bear and cat are fixed regardless of the weapon you use.</div></div><hr />
