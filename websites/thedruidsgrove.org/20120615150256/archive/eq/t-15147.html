<br />
Parses? What it actaully does vs. what the description says?<br />
<br />
Shield Block<br />
<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated.<br />
You may train 1 rank at each of the following levels: 71, 73, 75<br />
Requirements: Must spend 12 ability points in Archetype Abilities.<br />
<br />
This ability grants you the chance to fully block an attack when using a shield. Increased ranks improve the chance to block attacks.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I haven't checked the percentage of swings that it fires, but seeing this in my logs is enough to tell me it's well worth it. :)</div></div><hr />

496 total swings at me.  From that total:<br />
<br />
191 hits.<br />
247 outright misses.  (These were relatively low level mobs.)<br />
37 dodges.<br />
21 blocks.<br />
<br />
That gives a 4.2% block rate (with a small sample).  If we assume that the dodge check occurs before the block check, then we have a 4.6% block rate for swings that are not dodged.  This is fairly close to the 5% block rate that Fenier gave for level 3 of the AA.</div></div><hr />

However, keep in mind that block is checked before hit/miss, so some of the hits you're blocking would have hit you anyways.  True decrease in hit rate, with roll order takened into consideration, is 2-3%.<br />
<br />
Eitherway, still one hell of an AA.</div></div><hr />

Using made up numbers, you might block 5% of swings, then dodge another 8% of remaining (non-blocked) swings, then avoid 10% of remaining swings.  Assuming you have correct percentages in the first place, the order that these check (ignoring riposte since that has an added bonus) does not matter.  Multiplication is commutative!<br />
<br />
If I block 50% of swings, then dodge 50% of remaining swings, I get hit 25% of the time.<br />
If I dodge 50% of swings, then block 50% of remaining swings, I get hit 25% of the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">01-04-2007, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding of the Combat system works as such:<br />
<br />
EQ functions as:  All Swings hit, UNLESS one of these checks passes. <br />
<br />
EQ Checks the following (Order per Maddock - Bold apply to Druids):<br />
<br />
Block <br />
Parry  <br />
Riposte <br />
Dodge<br />
Shield Block<br />
<br />
Now, since Druids don't gain Block, Parry or Riposte, The first check is against avoiding the attack completly.  This is likely a function of your Dodge Skill, Avoidance AC, any +Avoidance Items, and any Dodge Mods you may have.<br />
<br />
If the check fails, without Shield Block, you would get hit and EQ would process the damage.<br />
<br />
Once you purchase Shield Block, you gain an extra check to avoid damage, which occurs once the game has determined you've failed all previous checks.  This occurs from parsing I beleive 1, 3 and 5% of the time for Priests.<br />
<br />
If Shield Block also fails, then the Game determines the Mob's Hit Score, which is a function of the NPC ATK value verus your mitigation AC.  This is the place our attack debuffs come in.  <br />
<br />
The value is then modifed by any vie style effects you may have running and then applied to your health total.<br />
<br />
Because of this AA, and the general benifits of Shield AC not being subject to Softcap returns, there is exactly no reason to wield a Non-Shield Secondary Item.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure if the item in question is a Shield, look up the item in Lucy, Click Raw Data and look at the itemtype field.  A Shield is itemtype 8.<br />

<br />
191 hits.<br />
247 outright misses.  (These were relatively low level mobs.)<br />
37 dodges.<br />
21 blocks.<br />
<br />
That gives a 4.2% block rate (with a small sample).  If we assume that the dodge check occurs before the block check, then we have a 4.6% block rate for swings that are not dodged.  This is fairly close to the 5% block rate that Fenier gave for level 3 of the AA.<br />
<br />
Then accordingly, this means without shield block he would get hit by 212 times.  Blocking 21 attacks from a possible 212 checks = 21/212 is about 10%, not 5%.</div></div><hr />

Parry<br />
Riposte<br />
Dodge<br />
Shield Block<br />
After the checks for these special abilities fail, there is still another check that determines whether the mob hits or misses (presumably a mob accuracy vs player avoidance-AC check).<br />
<br />
You can confirm this by noting that dodge and block rates are the same whether you're fighting a level 1 mob that misses almost every time, or a high level kyv that hits almost every time.<br />
<br />
So, the misses need to be included in the Shield Block failure count, not just the hits.</div></div><hr />

I have tried to come to terms with this several times over the last two days, and I still don't understand a few things. I think you are trying to say that that some of the blocks (and I presumed dodges) are attacks by the mob that would have missed us anyway, because of the calculation between mob attack and our AC. What I don't understand is what does that data get us, and how do we actually get that data?<br />
 <br />
I am assuming that we resolve combat in the most simplistic manner: some attacks we dodge, some attacks we block, sometimes the mob just misses us, and sometimes they hit us. <br />
 <br />
The reason why I am bringing this up is I don't think you can get data which can tell you if you did not dodge/block it might have missed anyway. I think you need to just assume that if you successfully dodged/blocked you are blocking an attack that actually would have hit you, because there is no concrete way to know if the attack would have failed a Mob offense versus PC defense check.<br />
 <br />
I personally am not trying to crunch numbers to make them any worse or better than they are, I just want to have a basic understanding of how the system works and try to remember to bandolier my shield on when I am getting pummeled.</div></div><hr />

Don't think of it as a waste, use your new secondary for stats and switch out to the shield in the rare times when you are getting hit.</div></div><hr />

I have shield block AA maxed and I have noticed it work pretty well. What I wasn't 100% sure about, if shield block really is totally separate from normal block. Someone asked me if it's any use to get an item with Improved Block for their druid and I answered no, because the item mod wont give us the skill itself, just +% modifier for already existing skill. Unlike cleave which gives us the ability to make melee crits. <br />
