Now in duels, it's rare if I lose them.  In normal PvP, whoever gets the drop on the other has a big advantage.<br />

Improved Bash can take the hunter out of the fight long enough to Hibernate their pet.  Root the hunter, and do what you will.  Worst comes to worst, you can always root the pet with Nature's Grasp, and concentrate on the hunter.<br />
<br />
Beast Master specd hunters have a new ability - Pet stun - available at 21 points in Beastmastery tree.  This is very hard to counter in a duel, as it interrupts casting and is on a 30 second cooldown iirc.</div></div><hr />

Basicly I take advantage of her going that deep into BM tree and that her pet is 1/2 to 2/3 of her overall dps.  From the start I moonfire, natures grasp then bear up.  She sends her pet who is promptly rooted.  I &quot;walk&quot; towards her to trigger her freeze trap, leavingher with two options, stand there and look pretty or blow beastal wrath at begining of fight to free her pet.  Normally she waits for pet to unroot before shooting me wich lets ice trap go away.  Once we are all free and moving she uses beastal wrath to up her pets dps dramaticly, I then use frenzied regen knowing the intimidation is comming soon and I wont be able to manually heal myself.  From there on out shes blown her two great attacks from pet tree and I can fight her as normal, charging to imobilize and staying bear to soak up all that damage.  NS is a must here between the two of them theydeal some pretty massive damage.  I find hunters to be one of the more dificult to fight.  Specially if they feing death + retrap to keep distance..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vir</div><div class="date">10-05-2005, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah your probly going to get feared, but honestly is squishy form a viable option against a dps class? I think the key here is hold back with your charges till you absolutly need them.  I know hutners are dps class but I havent seen alot within normal level limits that will drop you THAT fast.  One main problem is the SmartPet addon because it now breaks their pets attacks when they fear/trap you giving them full time to get an aimed shot in.  Prehaps things change dramaticly at 60 as they do with many other classes.  At the moment though squishy + hunter doesnt mix well, exspecially with the new BM talents..</div></div><hr />

Just mez the pet, then root them and get in the &quot;dead zone&quot;. The zone between their Ranged and Melee ranges.<br />
<br />
The main thing I find is to not let them drain you of your mana with Viper Sting or you're in trouble.<br />
<br />
Even Beastmater specced Hunters are not that hard, it just means you're going to take a little more punishment than the other specs. I rarely go into feral forms at all when fighting Hunters. Mez, Root, Moonfire, Wrath, Starfire is all I really need.</div></div><hr />
