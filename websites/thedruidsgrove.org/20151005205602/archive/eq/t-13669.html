Where did most of you have success at Level 59 to get to level 60?<br />
I have been quad kiting the Pirates/Swabby's in Timorous Deep but the experience is slow, even though they are all con blue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, as to what would work well now...<br />
<br />
I would suggest a couple camps in PoN.  Werewolves are level 53, so too low to get bonus XP, but using charm you could get very good XP regardless.  Gargoyles are level 57, so plenty of bonus, but some may be hard to single pull.  I never hunted in PoI or PoJ.  There are also some easily kited mobs in PoD, though I can't remember the names.  Those would be the first two places I'd look.  An easier alternative, at slightly less XP, might be the giant skellies in the NW corner of the Grey, sitting around the pond.  They are level 55.<br />
<br />
Just some random thoughts.<br />

It isn't as bad as in the days back but it still is, so XP in 59 is a decent bit slower than in 58 or 60.<br />
 <br />
PoN and PoD were so crowded when i was that lvl so i had no personal expirience in soloing there :)<br />
 <br />
I sugest any BoT group that need an aditional nuker/healer when your time permits that</div></div><hr />

The necro's there can use some company. Always nice to have a back up healing source if stuff goes wrong, and a back up snarer, Some regen to counteract lich, SOE, and some good dots to help make the mob go splat.</div></div><hr />

Need to buff the pet and CH it. Can do the break and recharm trick to get full exp.<br />
 <br />
Not all skunks are charmable at that level, some are too high. Which means it's a good idea to keep your pet alive. <br />
 <br />
Also the ramps to get up the bridge are hidden. So buff yourself with SOE.<br />
 <br />
Good exp except that you need to be very familiar with the zone in area to avoid add. Mobs hit for 300+ max, can be snared and rooted, are social however they are stationary and far apart so no add if you are careful (until you pass the bridge and get to the gate then you need harmony).<br />
 <br />
Suggest doing the zone in mobs first. When you know the place, move up to the bridge. Only the named mobs summon (each kind of mob in the zone in forest has a named).</div></div><hr />

Loot at that camp was fantastic back in the day, but probably just tribute trash now.  Repops are pretty fast, but there's plenty of other stuff to pull too.  Just avoid the golems.</div></div><hr />

You may not be flagged yet, but if you can get the flag, do so... My Druid was 51 when he got PoFire flagged, and I loved the exp there, just go duo with a Necromancer or another Druid higher level or something like an Enchanter, two box those, and go to town on those mothers... I thought it was awesome EXP, but that is just my two cp... Enjoy the tips. Use what you feel more comfortable doing, :)...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drelf</div><div class="date">05-27-2006, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoD was good for me.  I went from 56 to 60, 6 AAs, and 3 parchements for our 61-62 spells by charming diseased rats and killing flies.  What I like about this place is that I can solo it and it is pretty much empty.  BTW, xp its slow, but you can earn your exp there at your own pace.  With a charmed rat, I usually kill 5-6 flies at a rate of 1 dead fly every 45 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
