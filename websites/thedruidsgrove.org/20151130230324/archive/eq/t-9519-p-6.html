killed the 2nd cycle, 3rd cycle doesnt spawn, another druid comes by and helps me, I egress come back 3rd cycle is up, kill it, same with 4th. Get to the very End. Event is bugged, we have a DB Madman, but he wont do anything.<br />
<br />
After 30 mins of trying to get it to work , we ended up just killing him and I camped it all over again for another hour.<br />

<br />
Tuomas got the Rusty Mining Pick from somewhere @12:14, went to Feerrott, did something to get the Diseased Rune @13:00, combined it and the Soul Stone in the Mangled Head in the vicinity of the bridge and received the Runed Skull @13:01, ported to SFG, turned in the Runed Skull to Niera and received Niera's Research Notes @13:05.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Midoriana</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another random thought... In our first epic we take the dust of Neria's departed mother to &quot;a human skeleton&quot; in Frontier Mountians and he gives us the necklace and despawns. How about asking him about the managled head or animating the head? Just a thought but if we are using Neria again - maybe we should ask that human skeleton (he is dead and doesn't hurt us) if he can help us again? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerohn</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That route doesn't really consider the possibility of teleporting, but I guess it's worth considering.<br />
 <br />
Personally, I'm operating on the theory that this is bigger than one person.  For example:<br />
 <br />
One person starts out in Rathe Mountains, possibly having the unkempt druids corrupt his maiden's hair, for distribution around the Antonica - or perhaps for a specific target in Antonica.  He leaves the mountains and is promptly dumped into the river in Feerrott and eaten by the Swamp Terror.  We have his head and a bit of the Maiden's hair from that fateful trip.   We'll call him, for kicks, Antonica Man.  He's definitely dead, as we're trying to reanimate his head.<br />
 <br />
Another distributor, who we'll call Kunark Man, sets out to poison Kunark - or perhaps a specific target in Kunark.  We have a bit of his diseased maiden hair, recovered from goblins, who seem to claim they've eaten him.  Assuming that's true...we have a second dead distributor in Kunark Man.<br />
 <br />
I could continue this with Velious Man, but he could be either of the previous two, simply at another point in the trip, as we don't have any indication that he died.  In any case, both (or all) of these guys are working for one entity.  It could be a person, a god, the unkempt, whatever.<br />
 <br />
Most of this came from the obvious conflicts and Niera noting that there was no pattern.  I'm guessing that with the Soulstone from Geadin and the new information on animating the head, we'll essentially get a message from Antonica Man, identifying himself and setting us on a mission to either stop more of these distributors (Luclin Man, Velious Man, Odus Man, Faydwer Man etc.) or lead to information on curing the disease, or both - which will prompt a confrontation with the entity responsible.<br />
 <br />
Yes, this is all a guess and doesn't really have any affect on our current status, but I thought I'd post it.  On the off chance that it might spark a thought in someone else's head on where to look.<br />
 <br />
As far as the current step is concerned, unless someone managed to find Geadin for more information on animating this skull, the ideas on checking with necromancers and other nefarious characters (perhaps the outcasts behind the secret wall in Echo Caverns) seem like prime targets for getting information on animating this skull.<br />
 <br />
Feel free to bash or ignore, as you see fit. :)</div></div><hr />

You forgot the note about Animating Heads he recieved at 12:48. This is the item we are to find next, I believe. Seems he was searching Velious zones because of the mining pick he submitted, but with the time difference between the pick and note, he could've found it anywhere. I'm going to head to ToFS after work and look there, as well as other Velious zones.</div></div><hr />

We have found 2 beings that have been killed and eaten (feerrott and FM), so obviously we have more than one person spreading the problems.<br />
 <br />
We have a lot of similarities between this one and epic 1.0..<br />
IE.. Corrupted HG = foraged hair<br />
Corrupted BArricuda = handful of hair<br />
 <br />
While we have wandered away from epic 1.0 areas, a lot of it does correspond. Has anyone tried talking to the NPC's that we gave the essences to for 1.0? Not just withered treant and such but the guys (like Yeka Ias in South Karanas who gave you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica.) that we turned items into that despawned??<br />
Not sure if this will actually lead anywhere, but thought it might be worth a try..<br />

Are we making this too hard? it's .. A Mining Pick .. used in mines. The only mines I can think of are Mines of Nurga, Crystal Caverns and Befallen .. yes I'm sure there are more... but look at these mines. <br />
<br />
&quot;T&quot; talks to npc and receives mining pick or kills mob and loots mining pick. <br />
He goes to a &quot;mine&quot; and mines something (ie spell scroll)? He gets the pick at 12:04 - would think that it would take a while to &quot;mine something&quot; because he got the spell scroll at 12:48. Possibly being in a location for a ground spawn?<br />
Once he finds the spell scroll things move to fast for this to be a raid mob. And I can't see a mining pick falling off a raid type mob =p<br />
As for the mines... Nurga is off FM - there is the &quot;a human skeleton&quot; talk to him whatever - go to nurga and mine something? OR...<br />
Crystal caverns... there is the &quot;terror&quot; room - that is similar to the terror we kill in Feerott....<br />
Befallen - a skeletal excavator ... well he's already mining so maybe he can tell us what/where we are supposed to mine?<br />
<br />
Just thoughts - not trying to spam ... but provoke thoughts :) Good job guys!</div></div><hr />

A druid just failed this part because he didn't sing enough.  His lines were showing up ok for him, but we'd see a lot of skipped lines.  You should make sure you have a sufficient /pause in your hotkey.. /pause 20 is working for me so far.<br />
<br />
/say Yo ho.  No sun!!<br />
/pause 20<br />
/say A skeleton's day is never done<br />
/pause 20<br />

Last pause is important so you don't start and skip the first line too early.  Friend says /pause 15 was good for him.  Anyway, just a heads up... don't want people wasting 30 minutes of spamming for nothing~</div></div><hr />

Last pause is important so you don't start and skip the first line too early<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, you don't need the first line.  You can just spam the second line, given above, without the pause.  As long as you are getting an echo message, you should be doing fine.   Just do that and tell the abandoned pet that you are on the job when he comes around, and you should be alright.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">froni</div><div class="date">09-30-2004, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way back in April of 2001 was the GM event that started the plague in the Karanas. Azibelle Spavin, who seemed to be a paladin of Bertoxxulous, was at the road marker in Qeynos Hills and was looking for an item. When she got it, she did some magic and had people take the resulting noxious jar to MELDRATH only he was at the wizard spires in NK instead of his cave in Steamfont. There he released the plague that made the Karanas green and itchy for a couple of months. After the GM event to cleanse the plains was done (which surprisingly used the power of Rodcet Nife) Azibelle was incorporated into the Qeynos Badge of Honor quest and resides in the Qeynos Aqueducts. She is triggered by a hand in to Guard Helminth (I think that is the name).<br />
   <br />
 I doubt any of this will be incorporated, but just in case wanted to post the lore. (It was the first GM event I ever saw, and while I was too little a druid to participate I had a philosophical discussion with Azibelle about disease and the balances in nature.)<br />
  <br />
 Forgot to mention Mordavin Telase had to be captured in the event that ended the plague. I think Vegalys arrested him and took him from West Karana back to Qeynos. Meanwhile the antidote was derived from something found in Mordavin's possession and used in the healing ritual. I don't remember it very well just that there were fire works in the sky during the cleansing.<br />
 <br />
 You can read part of this in the text for the fourth stage of the Qeynos Badge quests.  BTW it says that Mordavin was put to death for his crime, so if we run into him he better be undead or Vegalys has some explaining to do.</div></div><hr />

* Make one Hotkey with a 2 second pause in between lines.<br />
 <br />
* Target yourself while saying these lines (when this was done I got the emote everytime)<br />
 <br />
* Make sure to target the abandoned heretic pet to say &quot;I am on the job&quot;.<br />
 <br />
* Reset time on this event is instant.  I saw 5 people do this event, one right after another.  When the Skellys get back to give the person in front of you the scroll, step up and start right into the Text prompts, not the song (after Pet leaves if he is there).  As long as the person in front of you did the event correctly you can start as soon as the pet leaves and the skellys get back to work. After text prompts equip the Pick and start the Macro.<br />

<br />
You say, 'who is Rendolf Deathbringer?'<br />
<br />

You say, 'who is Tehana Elsent?'<br />
<br />
compelled spirit says 'Tehana is a true necromancer.  She studies the lore and the spells.  She knows everything there is to know about the undead.  She has been studying diseases, but I don't think they really meant much to her except that they make people dead.  She was the one to recreate some of Mordavin's work from his notes and repurposed it for Azibelle's needs.  She's kind of excited about killing everyone.  She is inspired by Azibelle and Glenfire and does most of the support work for the coven.'<br />

  <br />
 I've spawned the Swamp Terror for a few other druids while the Raider is camped. Now, that gives you the head, you can get the books in PoK and get the note, you can get the soul stone from the madman in North Ro. Unknown as of yet about getting the scroll from the skele's without having completed everything.<br />
  <br />
 So Really I'm wondering if someone can just loot the head, get the soul stone, notes, and scroll without having to get the raider/hider events. Will it work, or will there be a flag issue? Are there flags? Maybe when the epic is solved, this theory can be tested. I suggest that everyone do each part themselves until then but, it may be a way to help others in your guilds to bypass these steps.<br />

You can't.  What you loot is a head, not a container.  You have to get the cloth from Niera to wrap the head in and give it back to her to get the container mangled head back.   And you don't get the wrapping cloth except as part of her response to you giving her the bag with the maiden hair combined in it.  And you don't get THAT container unless you do the initial forage, and all the maiden's hair collecting after that as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is a segment I stole from Banegrivms MASSIVE Everquest Lore archive, called the Codex of War. This guy REALLY knows his lore, and works now for Brad McQuaid on EQ-RPG. (Writes the stuff!) <br />
--------------------------- <br />
The Coming of the Plaguebringer (GM Event via Patches) <br />
I still remember that day as if it has been yesterday. I had heard the tells of some rude individuals that had appeared outside the gates of Qeynos and near the square harassing passers by. Of course I did not think much of it, save those I helped to defend. <br />
<br />
But no less then a few week later was when their camps grew and these rude individuals now became replaced by ones much more Loathsome to behold. These Loathsome individuals spread their camps out into the hills of Qeynos, where they awaited and continued with their dark rites. Within their midst could be found those of the profession of rogues, priests, wizards, and warriors. <br />
<br />
The wizards carried in their possession unknown runes and a strange tome of research. The priests would occasionally be found to carry a weapon called a Runed Branding Iron. <br />
<br />
Within the hands of the warriors were found strange swords that seemed as if to denote rank. The blades in order were Initiate's Blade, Adept's Blade, and Befouled Longsword. <br />
<br />
Thieves from these camps were said to have been spotted by the locals sneaking into the Temple of Life within the shadow of night to steal the scrolls from within. <br />
<br />
The keeper of the Lion's Mane Tavern, Earron Huntlan, wrote to Antonius Bayle complaining of these individuals. Eventually, he sent the Magistrate, Vegalys Keldrane, to investigate the matter. Vegalys sought proof that these now Loathsome Individuals were up to no good and began to summon the aid of many adventurers. <br />
<br />
It was then that Al'Kabor discovered a strange diary page, and determined the symbol on the page to be part of an incantation to summon Bertoxxulous himself. An ancient rite long past from Dartain and the heretics that had founded old Paineel, which now lays consumed within the darkness of The Hole. Similar pages were found laying around Qeynos and Qeynos Hills. <br />
<br />
Azibelle Spavin  the witch of Qeynos, was reported to meet with shady characters and whisper conversations in the Lion's Mane Tavern. Tylman Lushfeld, a bard in love with Azibelle, would sit in the bar during the day, pining for Azibelle. She would show up at night. <br />
<br />
There are some that say in hushed whispers that long ago Azibelle Spavin stood at a crossroads and sold her soul to the Plaguebringer on a dark and stormy night, when lost souls peered about from the world beyond. <br />
<br />
Bandit runners carrying pieces of Marble and Enchanted Clay, and some strange paint were discovered in and around Qeynos as well. Some of these were Gnolls. They occasionally were found to carry a Brooch of Sw'Vaye (proof of allegiance to Rykonis Sw'Vaye, who Antonius Bayle had banished from Qeynos) from amidst their possessions. <br />
<br />
The scroll thief (who spawned every night at 11pm game time), carried a scroll, which could be turned into Athrin Tashir in the Tavern, who in turn gave a reward in the semblance of a ring (and XP as well). <br />
<br />
The pages found from the ground (the primary numbered ones) combined with the right rune (from the loathsomes) in the new research book (also from the loathsomes) returned an incantation (3 different types). These could be turned into Vegalys Keldrane at the wall atop the gate of Qeynos, as proof of the misdoings of these Loathsome Individuals. Adventurers were rewarded with a random piece of Rubicite armor (no breastplate). <br />
<br />
The Runed Branding Irons could be turned in as well to the local Magistrate; same reward. <br />
<br />
After about two weeks, the Loathsome Individuals fled, along with the Thief and all other related individuals. It was then announced that their leader, Mordavin Telase, had been captured.  <br />
The Trial of Mordavin Telase then came to pass. It was revealed that he intended on unleashing a plague on the entire Kingdom of Qeynos (Qeynos, Karana Plains, and Surefall Glade) that would slay all those who dwelled within the Kingdom's borders. (GM Event) <br />
<br />
The Scrolls were being stolen to research a Rune which would protect the Bloodsabres and their allied from the coming plague. That rune was found to match the rune on the Runed Branding Iron. The incantations were discovered to be part of an ancient rite to summon Bertoxxulous himself. Only three of the four parts of the incantation were ever found. Woe and despair be to the bringer of the fourth rune that would doom us all to pestilence and decay. <br />
<br />
Telase and the Bloodsabres had been building a Temple to Bertoxxulous in the Qeynos sewers. Hence the paint, marble, and clay. The workload proved too much for him, so he enlisted the help of Rykonis Sw'Vaye. Rykonis Sw'Vaye in turn hired the gnolls to help in the tasks at hand. <br />
<br />
Mordavin managed to escape at his trial, and the hunt was on. He was eventually found in the western Karanas heading towards an encampment of sorts. He was apprehended by a band of adventurers and imprisoned within the dungeons of Qeynos. (GM Event) <br />

Anyway, overall, I have to agree, we got a great storey line for our quest. A little odd and obscure in some points, but still great.

'What is this? Where am I? Who are you? What do you want from me?&quot; before I did my combine.<br />
<br />
Then I did the combine because I figured that the ghost would become tangible when the combine is done. At some point it is targetable, but not for long it seems. <br />
<br />
Anyways, is the ghost supposed to be spamming the message i quoted above before you do the combine? Is the message triggered by the pressense of the soul stone and animating heads or was it spamming the message simply because the person before me had it bugged and the ghost was still spamming it from his combine?<br />
<br />
If the ghost gives the message only after you do the combine then I suggest not doing the combine if you are already hearing the ghost spam the message.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that was confusing : P<br />
<br />
Edit - Upon camping madman after the first bugged ghost in Feerrott, I got another soul stone, and went back to Feerrott. The compelled spirit was not spamming his message this time until after I had done the combine. This was a little more than 2 hours after last attempt, so the timer had been reset fully. Nobody else had done the event. I go through dialogue and still spirit is bugged. I'm not attempting this part again until it's fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After killing the Furtive Figure, I ran straight to South Karana and at dead on 12:00am (08:50 GMT) gametime, the Coven spawned, I sat and listened to them, then they despawned.<br />
<br />
The next 72 minutes goes by, and at 12:00 the coven failed to respawn, so I went back to Qeynos and re-killed the Furtive Figure again, he didn't have the note on him this time, however I still had my note on me from the first kill, so that could explain why.<br />
<br />
I ran back to SK and waited for the next 12:00, at which point they spawned.. Coincidence perhaps, or just the fact that it's 140 minutes since they despawned, I dunno.<br />
<br />
I botted a 14K tank with me and pulled the coven, snared/rooted them away from each other, and set the tank on one, while I let the pets they had summoned die to my damage shield.<br />
<br />
They hit pretty quick at 408 max hit, and they have a fair bit of HP each too, each one dropped a Crystal Fragment (ID 62852).<br />

There were two untargettable members of the coven that vanished when I engaged, guess this explains that, so now to find where they went, and what to do with the crystals.<br />

Once you've gotten the crystals go to West Freeport and visit Shana Liskia and give them to her for:<br />
Well these certainly are interesting.  You say that there might be more of them on those necromancers that escaped?  Well here, take this.  Find all of them and place them into this bag to keep them safe.  Then bring them all to me and I'll examine them more closely.  I can tell you that they are similar to the Mind Crystal, but appear to have different magical properties.  I have never seen anything like them and I suspect that they are not from Norrath.<br />
<br />
She hands you Small Padded Bag (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62853) A six slot bag and the three crystals back.<br />
<br />
Now head over to Harbingers Spire (which is where someone said the other &quot;coven spawner&quot; was) and go into the 3rd room on the left as you zone in, it has 3 Dragorns in it which are KOS, and Azibelle Spavin and Glenfire Telzir both RED cons to lvl 70, who are non-KOS.<br />
<br />
Cleared the room of the dragorns and engaged with just my warrior and myself, being Necros they cast Pyrocuror and Boil Blood, in defensive mode, Azibelle hit for max 379, whilst Glenfire hit me max for 914, both HT'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stumpydru</div><div class="date">10-01-2004, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How To: The Tox Skellies<br />
<br />
Follow the instruction listed in the walkthru but here is how to get it to work.<br />
<br />
1) When you click the Right Skelleton and say you script to get the pick make sure you equip it (that's in the walkthru). I used Hotkeys for each script since there are alot ot other druids there ready for you to mess up (on Torv server the others druids were very helpful/patient with each other, good job guys)<br />
<br />
2) Start singing for 30 mins. The key here as posted in the thread is the /pause 20 commands between the says and at the end of the song. TO HEAR THE ECHO YOU MUST TARGET YOURSELF!!!! (that is the main key)<br />
<br />
3) When the Pet guy comes up (he does it 5 or 6 times during the 30 mins) and ask who you are YOU MUST TARGET THE PET GUY AND SAY THE &quot;I AM ON THE JOB&quot; script. Once you say that to him target yourself and start singing again.<br />
<br />
If you do the above with the walkthrough you will not have any issues with getting the item. Now there is a bug in the pathing of the skelleton you original talked to and he may walk into the wall which will screw up your quest.<br />
<br />
If your quest gets screwed up do to the pathing do a /who all gm and if there is a GM/guide online send him a DIRECT TELL, stating you are having and issue with a Epic mob stuck in the wall. The key there is be polite to them and they may come help you if there not busy. Make sure to thank them if they come help you without the petition. Remember Guides are just regular players like us.<br />
<br />
Last night I was doing my Tox quest and the skelleton got stuck and when I looked for a GM for help, I asked nicely and 2 guides showed up in less than 2 mins. I kept singing until the event said I failed cause of the skeleton being stuck in the wall. After explaing to the guides how and waht is suppose to happen in the quest they retrigger the event and I had to sing for another 30 mins (which was fine with me since I needed the piece and it beat waiting 2 hrs). At that time a 3rd guide showed up and they followed the skeeletons and watched there paths during my 30 mins. After 30 mins the right skeelleton actually walked up and gave me the item (which was great). After that I was talking to the Guide and told him it must be a random issue and he agreed since hedid see my original skelleton over my the wall.<br />
<br />
Once I was done successfully, the next druid stepped up and triggered the quest as stated above. The GMs sat there for another 30 mins so they could watch to see if the pathing was going to get screwed up. I logged before the next druid completed the quest.<br />
<br />
Thanks Tash, Blump, Tenyu for helping out with the GMs and waiting patiently for us to work the issue out with the GMs.</div></div><hr />

The SK coven trio come with two pets.  Just snare and root them all.  Have some resists up, as they will cast lots of spells on you.  Once you get them rooted, take out the two pets, and root dot them down.<br />
<br />
The Harbinger coven duo didn't summon, and could be snared and rooted, although since they were red, they resisted a bit and broke root.  Azi hit max for 989.  The SK for a little more.   Soloable with some luck and some work, but easy to get to, so bring a couple friends along.   Don't back out into the hallway, or you will get adds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Shana Liska takes the crystal fragments from the pouch. She applies a drop of liquid to it. The liquid turns the crystal white where it spreads. These small crystals are easier to work with than the Mind Crystal. They also differ from the Mind Crystal in that they are from the Plane of Discord. Take this mixture and find something to enhance its magical power and you just might be able to purify the Mind Crystal. I have no idea what that might be, but I know what it should be. You'll need two components. One will increase the power of the mixture, something with a lot of magical power. It needs to be a liquid of powder to integrate properly. And you'll need a stabilizer, something to help the mixture and the new material to remain stable. This influences the kind of attunement that the crystal takes on during the process. It should be something from nature if you want the result to suit your tastes. You'll have to find someone that knows of something about it among the druids for help on what to use. <br />

If that's the case, I think jumping ahead to the Emerald Moss is a lil odd.  Also, finding the &quot;druid&quot; that's supposed to tell us what's up should be the utmost of importance.  As I stated on the Serverwide, I feel the &quot;liquid of powder&quot; will be a GoD or OoW drop.  She states it would be highly magical, and thus far, the &quot;highly magical&quot; items have been from areas touched by Discord.<br />
 <br />
On second thought, I have a feeling that the &quot;balancing item&quot; will be grown - most likely from the Moss and Brambles along with other such items.  That will be combined with the Mind Crystal and the other item...but now that I think about it, perhaps the Mind Crystal will be enhanced on it's own, then in another step after that we combine the two (Crystal and Staff, as seen in the Emu SS).  *Sigh*  I'm rambling again.  &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

Take this mixture and find something to enchance its  magical power and you justmight be able to purify the Mind Crystal. I have no idea what that might be, but i know what it should do. You'll need two componets. One will have to increase the power of the mixture, and something with a lot of magical power. it needs to be a liquid or powder to integrate properly. And you'll need a stabilizer, someting to help the mixture and the new material to remain stable. This influences the kind of attunement that the crystal takes on during the process. It should be something from nature if oyu want the results to suit your tastes. You'll have to find someone that knows something about it among the druids for help on what to use.<br />

First time posting here and I must commend all the hard work everyone has put forth as well as the team work found throughout the servers! <br />
<br />
Just now, I went to visit the PoJ Great Bear and tried every charm spell available and received the message, &quot;This NPC cannot be charmed.&quot; When I hail him in any language, the text states, &quot;Great Bear growls uncooperatively.&quot; No text with saying &quot;unkempt&quot; to him and again, the &quot;uncooperatively&quot; emote with &quot;tribe of the dawn&quot;.<br />
<br />
Other than the PoJ trials, I have spent little time in this zone but while thinking about why this mob was now uncharmable, I hailed the 2 NPCs in the room with the bear. All of my languages are max'd and I got the Arch priest Del`Maque to talk to me by using Elder Teir`Dal. He spoke of Najena and a crystal sphere. (I apologize as I did not save the text log for any of this.) The other NPC, Al`Corsalm reponded to Old Erudian. Something I noted in the text was, &quot;Erud's new city needed magical channels, certain qualities of natural bedrock which conveyed that power innate to the earth.&quot; I am unsure if any of this is new text or from older quests or lore. However, I thought it might possibly tie in with the &quot;liquid of power&quot; commented on earlier in this thread.<br />

In summary, I was wondering if anyone else has had the problem of the Great Bear being uncharmable, if I am doing something wrong, or if this part is now bugged?</div></div><hr />

The great bear not being charmable is kinda weird though. Probably is bugged. Kill him and let him repop again, maybe that will fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forage Blasted Stone in Bloodfields<br />
Item Lore: A rough stone of mixed material.<br />
<br />
Go to Targen Stonefall in Nedaria's Landing<br />
<br />
	You say, 'Hail, Targen Stonefall'<br />
	Targen Stonefall says 'Hello there, Gamli.  I hope you fare well in your travels. I've decided to settle in here, next to the warm fires of the smithy rather than visit the plane of discord again. It's nasty, but is certainly has some [interesting stones].'<br />
<br />
	You say, 'what interesting stones'<br />
	Targen Stonefall says 'Well, I've been hearing about stones that have inherent power, much like those that we've been calling augmentation stones. These are cruder and you'd have to talk to someone else about exactly how to work with those. I'm more of a geologist myself. I study the way earth and stone are formed. I think there's a lot we can learn about this place from the formation of the [native stones].'<br />
<br />
	You say, 'what native stones'<br />
	Targen Stonefall says 'Just about any of them, really. I've seen most of what can be found, but if you see anything interesting, please let me look at it. You never know what gems you might find! Best of luck to you, my friend.'<br />
 <br />
Give him Blasted Stone<br />
 <br />
	Targen Stonefall looks carefully at the stone.  He takes out a cloth and some liquid and rubs the stone thoroughly.  'Why do you waste my time, friend?  This is a rock from Norrath.  I suppose it's kind of you to bring it to me, you probably didn't know any better, but I can't do anything with this.  Where did you find this?<br />
<br />
You recieve Washed Blasted Stone<br />
Item Lore: A rough stone of mixed material.<br />
<br />
	You say, 'bloodfields'<br />
Targen Stonefall says 'Very interesting.  I tell you what, I'll buy that stone from you if you want.  How about a plat for it?  No sense arguing, that's as much as I'll offer.'</div></div><hr />

On another note, Coven spawned for a druid immediately after, but didn't spawn one EQ day later. First druid had note, second did not. So not sure if this is simply a required step though it is not eused for hand in, or if coven is bugged seeing as how the one spawn is one of only 2 spawns for the entire day.</div></div><hr />

I just nuke kited them all. (btw. pull them before they get their pets up and you dont have to worry about the pets).<br />
<br />
For the Coven in Harbringers, I brought another druid and a necro, we cleared the hall, and then invised into the room, targeted one of the named, and then pulled them back into the hallway without agroing the adds. Took quite a bit to kill them, they have a lot of hit points, but duoable easily.<br />
<br />
And I got pretty lucky, got the emerald moss as my first forage in Emerald Jungle. lol.<br />

I've spent many EQ days in SK and no pop, but then some other druid gets it.<br />

Edit:  Ok so it goes around 12 Real Hours without a spawn then 2 spawns in back to back midnights (72min apart)... your guess is as good as mine.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the picture and what the bear says to us, our epic is going to be our Living Brambles Seed Growing into some tree/staff and the Mind Crystal being the ornamentation...<br />
So we might be looking for a fluid, pot, etc in which to grow the two items together.</div></div><hr />

Hadnt spawned until he suggested Invis.  Middun invised just before midnight and sure enough they popped.  We stuck around to test the theory again and sure enough with both of us invised it popped again.  Maybe just coincidence but worth a try.</div></div><hr />
