<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SudaWilde</div><div class="date">07-24-2008, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after something like a 2 or 3 year hiatus from the game I have decided to return for another run at it.  I played occasionally during this downtime and in the last 2 days spent a bit of time in Bot getting Suda up to lvl 70, hot zone and all that.  Well I have a few Issues coming from my absence and rather fast lvling.  I have 2 or 3 of the lvl 66 - 70 spells and outside of buying the lower two lvls of the runes in the bazaar I am lost about how to proceed as far as gathering those spells.  Seriously, I miss the old EQ where MAYBE one or 2 spells were dropped and the rest were vendor.  Could I get away with ignoring the 66-70 spells?  are there any of those that are must haves?<br />
<br />
Is there someplace where I can lvl and get drops for my soon to have lvl 71-75 spells?<br />
<br />
Finally, my equipment is POP lvl and lacking in a rather serious way.  As to this point, it has not been a hindrance because BOT stuff is easy for a druid to heal against with even a little skill but I fear as I progress it will become a more and more detrimental situation that I would like to resolve.  Here is my magelo<br />

I know I am asking a lot but I logged in yesterday and was completely overwhelmed with places to go and things to do.  I have no idea what I can and can not solo in the new expansions after pop.  How to get to them.  Anything you can offer for assistance would be amazing.  Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Places I can farm and solo for Plat would also be appreciated.  Not looking for be rich, just a little coin to fill some holes as it were.<br />

I heard that the Trio rings, earrings face and neck are nice too so I will work on those.  So equipment is moving along nicely.  Still have to deal with the spell issue.  Hate having spells I could be casting not available because SOE loves to make people burn time for something they already earned when they leveled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrian</div><div class="date">07-25-2008, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can buy alot of the gear that drops in dragonscale hills for real cheap in the bazaar. Most seem to go for less than 2k pp. The new jewelry can get expensive fast but they are decent if you can afford them. As for the spells, I wouldn't advise skipping them because they are all useful at the level you get them. However, you can get away with it. If you are getting decent gear upgrades, then eventually you can solo some WoS named for runes. They do summon, but if you use ds's, HoT potions, and pile on the dot's then you can beat them.<br />
 <br />
For the 71-75 spells I would start of charm kiting in The Steppes, then Icefal Glacier as you level. There are lots of animals to choose from in these zones and most drop spells. Though it's a toss up as to which spells you get. Sell the spells you don't need and buy the rest if you want. After that get the SoF charm and head to Loping Plains and charm kite the worgs and gators. These drop spells occasionally as well. Buying both levels of the aa Entrap is a must for this. If you find that Loping Plains is a little out of your league, then you can charm kite the snakes and stuff in DSH. Just stay away from the cats...they can't be snared.</div></div><hr />

The bracers and shield are in one of the zones you are talking about so that works nicely.  The Cave bears are red con to me so the killing is slow but it is manageable.  I was told at my lvl and mana pool I would not be able to solo them....   <br />

The new charm is lvl 73 i think right?  I will be pushing for that spell fast.  Charming is the own.</div></div><hr />

Get 4 of em and turn em into npc in valdeholm for a pretty decent bracer. You can do it twice btw. 71-75 spells can be bought off a vendor in stepps, the rank 2 are drops but you should be able to buy em in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">07-29-2008, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suda - I'm also a returning player and am having similar challenges.  So I feel your pain about needing gear upgrades.  There are currently some 350 hp/mana druid gear dropping in the re-vamped BlackBurrow zone.  Although I attempted to play main healer using Cholotrope and a mana pool of 8k and it wasn't nearly enough.  The gear is attunable and sold in bazaar but a bit pricey from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
The TSS charming spell called Beast's Beckoning is for druids of lvl 71.  It can be used to charm animals up to lvl 73.  The rank 1 spell can be bought from Rang Kelliam in The Steppes.  As Damas pointed out, rank 2 spells are dropped from mobs.  The rank 3 spells are dropped from raid mobs I think.  With the rank 1 spell, I've had moderate success charming mammoth's in Icefall.  Although there are those mobs that are lvl 74-75 on occasion and cannot be charmed.  Those are usually just rooted and dotted to death eventually.  Note the bears and wolves are also tagged as animals.<br />
<br />
The spells and gear in The Burried Sea expansion seem to be purchased with a new currency (doubloon or orum) which is gained from group missions in the expansion.  I'm still reading about that expansion in TDG forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SudaWilde</div><div class="date">07-29-2008, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, after reading this thread and many others I decided to try the mammoths and found the exp to be very nice.  4 to 5 kills swarm kiting gets an AA point.  Still having some issues keeping agro on my new pet as I break charm off of old almost dead pet and bring in a new one.  I am not terribly fast at killing right now but it is getting better.  Reading about a technique and applying it is another thing.  So far I have managed to pull with Glam and Ensnare 4-5 of them and then use one as pet.  Innate cammo to drop charm when below 25% and charm another.  Keep the cycle going until most are almost completely dead then clean up with PBAOE, or Wave DDs.  Here is the problem, I have upgraded my gear a bit with the help of an insanely kind friend and am now around 8.6k mana prebuffed.  With those 5 Mammoths I will have about 50% mana (guessing here only done it a few times) by the time i have them ready to die.  Should I just keep pulling more mammoths using pets to kill the already seriously wounded mobs or do the AOE clean up thing?  I like the idea of constant pulling more pets and tried it one time but it was also my first time charming in oh say 3 years lol.  <br />
<br />
Thanks are due for everyone that has helped so far and for those that continue to help.  Have fun!<br />

Here is an updated Magelo...<br />

it is crazy that Magelo is still reporting AC wrong.  Unbuffed he has 1544 AC right now.  Mags is showing almost 500 less funny.</div></div><hr />

Working on the mammoths and with 3 of them I can seem to control the grouping much better but that slows down the killing.  Something I am not looking forward to.  Working on a solution.</div></div><hr />
