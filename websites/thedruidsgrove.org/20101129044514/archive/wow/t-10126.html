<br />
Engineering, for example, requires huge amounts of resources that are all-too-easy to pick up from the AH, and provides almost no income.<br />
<br />
Some people also regularly shop for better items from the AH, and still others don't bother picking up vendor trash to sell.<br />
<br />
Making money in Warcraft can be a tricky business for the inexperienced..<br />

<br />
I kept buying recipes and purchasing herbs when I was too lazy to go farm them.  Then I wouldn't be able to sell the pots for as much as even the mats cost sometimes, and others I actually used the potions (drinking cash).  After I got my skill to where I wanted it at the time though I turned it around and started making money off transmutes and selling herbs.<br />
<br />
My cousin is 15 levels behind me and has 3 to 4 times the cash I do.  He sells everything he can lay his hands on, gears up by getting guildies to go through instances with him, and never buys anything.  He has enchanting and tailoring (mage), and hasn't even started leveling them yet.  I guess its just how one chooses to play.</div></div><hr />

He made so much money that he actually bought his epic _before_ he dinged 60, and as a result, the moment it happened, he mounted up and went to celebrate.  :)<br />

I had 55s when I dinged 40.  I had just finished my Tribal Leather quest when that happened so a lot of money has gone into my LW.  As far as what is &quot;taking my gold&quot;, I think the root source is there was no gold there to begin with.  The most I've ever had was 20g, I have 10 slot bags and have not bought 1 piece of armor.  This is my first run through WoW so I don't know what the big sellers are or where to farm for expensive drops.<br />
<br />
That's my reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Santaria</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the feed back on this, I really did not think I would get any!<br />
<br />
This is my first time playing WOW and the only other game I have played that was even close to this was RuneScape. <br />
<br />
There are a couple choices I made at the start that have helped me gaine a small fortune (for my lvl). Me being a Druid I can only wear leather armor so I thought it was only right to take skinning/leatherworking as my professions, I always farmed my own leather and made my own armor, of course as I gained in lvl's there were some things I would make that I had to buy some mats but by that time money was not an issue. I have always been about 5 lvl's ahead of myself in the leather working area.<br />
<br />
Two skills that go together really well are fishing and cooking, People have to eat to replenish there health and you can train fishing right along with cooking (I know it's boring,but). Selling fish at the AH is a very easy way to make lots of money. There is always a damand for Oily Blackmouth and FireFin Snapper and have you seen what Stonescale eel goes for!<br />
<br />
The most important thing I have learned about making money in WOW is to make an alt just for banking and buy/sell for the AH. When your out questing or grinding/farming take your green's and mail them to your alt, let him do all the work with listing it for auction. I'm not saying sell things at crazy prices either, research your items and come up with a fair price..better yet get an AH mod that will do it for you.<br />
<br />
I may not be the most decked out druid with all blues and the hottest weapons but when it does come time for an upgrade if I cant make it I'm not gonna have a problem buying it.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps somebody to make getting gold a little easier.</div></div><hr />

So the $$'s not flowing from high lvls twinking their alts yet.  I am also like 250ish in Cooking, Fishing and First Aid...so none of that has helped either lol.  I don't mind being broke as long as I have had fun doing the things that made me broke.  I think once I am satisfied where my crafting is, I can start selling raws and make a lot of money fast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">02-28-2006, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My problem is/was that I never farmed for anything coupled with the fact that I picked a none money making profession, enchanting, I have put too many resources into it to drop it so that was not an option for me. The only thing I spend my money on is profession and skills. I have yet to buy anything from the AH. I wear what I loot. I just have never stopped to really go after gold and since I have disenchanted most of the greens I find I haven't sold them. On top of all that I solo 99.9% of the time so I rarely run instances I do not have a block of time that I can find a group than run the instance. I have now found a way to make a couple gold off the laziness of other players by buying the expert first aid book along with the mageweave and heavy silk bandage books and selling them for 100% profit on the AH. sorry it was so long just wanted to throw my 2 cents in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If u do this, take a bit of time to get ur alt to lvl 5. Then u can learn enchanting and DE unsellable greens (&amp; blues). Enchanting materials are nice to sell since there is no deposit costs involved. If ur planning to sell drops do some research in other classes need (imo Wolf/Whale/Boar stuff can be de-d immediatly, nobody buys that).<br />
<br />
Also specify a buy-out price, unless u want to get a 'feeling' of the market for some item. Many players missed me buying there stuff, because they didn't specify a buyout.<br />
<br />
I know the feeling though, i was a very frustrated warrior from lvl 40 till lvl 43, running around in STV :( Espcially if u have a warlock in ur regular party :) My druid is my 2nd character and luckely my druid could immediatly get a mount since my warrior (which was lvl 60) made enough gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had so much gold from gathering professions that I dropped one and leveled engineering to 300 and had an extra 100g after I bought my mount.  Quite honestly a stack of ore or stack of herbs goes for quite a bit while skinning can really rake in cash.<br />
<br />
Also if you get a lucky blue drop you can half your mount money from that.  My brother got 2 blues one day and make 160g from them at level 20.</div></div><hr />

Those kind of prices for level 20 blues are ridiculous.  Nothing should be that expensive at such a low level, but I do admit that when I found out how many people level up alts to 19 for WSG and stay there, I sold any good level 19 blues and greens on the AH for ridiculous prices as well.  Mostly all have 60 alts that can buy anything for their uber-wsg build.</div></div><hr />

Honestly level 19 blues are worth 50g+. That's what they are worth regardless of what prices we have set in our heads.<br />
<br />
Twinks change the economy - I think they are trashy or really bad players personally, but their bag and bags of gold have to be spend somewhere I guess.<br />
<br />
To the topic - just get your 2 gathering professions and use the AH and your mount should be affordable by 40 even if you don't get a 'lucky' drop.</div></div><hr />
