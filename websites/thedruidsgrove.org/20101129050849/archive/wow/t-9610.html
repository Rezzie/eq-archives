<br />
So,  I was doing quests yesterday.  I was so happy when a  glowing brightwood staff dropped!!!  BUT.<br />
<br />
:mad2: Some damn rogue ninja'd it on me!<br />
<br />
He then started to mess with me and laugh about getting my epic staff.  SO.  :tut: <br />
<br />
I called in my friend tony of Redcell.  He shows up with about 30 guildies, and proceeds to stomp the life out of this rogue.  Whilst I danced in the middle,  30 horde camped this ninja's body for 3 hours.  :lmao: <br />
<br />
<br />
Taught that idiot not to mess with me.  I can understand, though.  It's been floating in AH for 300-400g as of late.<br />
<br />
Shadow Wing Focus Staff <br />
Binds when picked up <br />
Two-Hand Staff <br />
142 - 237 Damage Speed 3.20 <br />
(59.3 damage per second) <br />
+22 Stamina <br />
+40 Intellect <br />
+17 Spirit <br />
Durability 120 / 120 <br />
Requires Level 60 <br />
Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 56. <br />
<br />
I'd much rather have that, although.  With Azuresong + spell power enchant + the Epic books from Alterac Valley = over 100 extra dmg on every spell of your chosen build.</div></div><hr />

We camped him for 3 hours man,  I feel fine about losing brightwood staff.</div></div><hr />
