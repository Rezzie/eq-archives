As of yesterday I've raided this clunker eight times.  7 attempts were wipes.  Saturday we tried, and killed him, but then Veeshan crashed and we all lost our flags &gt;&lt;*  I've been waiting so very long to get into Tactics.<br />
<br />
What's a great guide to &lt;b&gt;kill&lt;/b&gt; this fella, in a nutshell?</div></div><hr />

Group at each corner (with a chanter) kills all spiders until MB spawns.  Have the rest of your raid outside outside the MB room while doing so.<br />
<br />
Once MB spawns leave only the chanters at the corners.  From that point on they will be mezzing all incomming spiders.  This frees up more dps/healers for MB.  Leave a healer to look after the chanter if you think you need too, but it sohuldnt be hard for them to keep spiders mezzed if you kill MB fast enough.  <br />
<br />
Send your tank in first furious helps get quick aggro, send in the rest of our melee and go max DPS as soon as its possible.<br />
<br />
The key things to remember are, AE heals.  MGB sotw/paragon/celetial are a must for a guild that cant drop in within a few seconds.  Last time we did MB he lasted long enough for me to cast 2 winters frosts on him, and I started casting with MB at 95%.  His HPs are very low, and the AE is resistable so buff up your resists.<br />
<br />
Hail as fast as possible or have someone aggro the hail mob and pull him out to one of the doorways - DECIDE WHICH WILL HAPPEN BEFORE (I've seen raids kill MB and not get flagged), the chanters will eventually be overcome with spiders or go oom, depending how well equipped they are.</div></div><hr />

Won't get hit by AE that way. Just got to test out in advance whether you can still reach the MT. Extended range items are an advantage there. <br />
<br />
If you have a lot of folks at the raid, it may be safer to not just position single chanters all around to block the spiders, but actually put groups there to kill them. Otherwise it can get rather messy.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure really why you're asking for strats though if you've killed him once, he's only gonna get easier for you in the future.</div></div><hr />

The more people you bring, the easier it gets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might be a spoiler for some<br />
<br />
A FD monk can pull the gnome you need to hail out of the area where the spiders explode. That makes hailing a lot more easy <br />
<br />
1) Set up corners <br />
2) Each chanter calls the corner he is guarding <br />
3) Start killing spiders not one should be allowed trhough<br />
4) MB becomes targerable<br />
5) Zerg him, unleash dps, Chanters keep all inc spiders mezzed<br />
6) HoT's up (CR/SoTW/Paragorn)<br />
7) Pull gnome out the hall (FD pull)<br />
8) Kill MB <br />
9) Enchanter stop mezzing and die in there corner <br />
10) Chanters are dragged and rezzed <br />
11) Hail gnome</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no need to zerg MB. When we went through this we regularily killed him flawlessly.<br />
<br />
Set up the 4 corners - we typically used tank, dps, healer, slower at each corner minimum. More to start with when people arent doing anything else but this should be sufficient to get through the fight.<br />
<br />
Once MB spawns we had some clerics (5 I think from memory) run a chain on a paladin. This guy ran in and moved MB to one of the sides of the room (pre-determined which side). We also used a warrior to cover rampage (to keep it away from anyone else mainly). <br />
<br />
Once the paladin had good aggro (20 seconds or so maybe) then nukers and rangers would run in to the other side of the room and unload on MB ... all out of range of the nasty ae's. Melees all stay on spider control.<br />
<br />
MB dies really fast, paladin just has to hold aggro and you are golden.</div></div><hr />

Lastnight (this morning, actually, around 4 am) I got together a rag tag crew of eager players.  I look accross the screen and count 78 people responding to my call to arms.  We came, we saw, we conquered. =)  We killed MB!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help here, if it wasn't for your advice I probably couldn't have done it =P  It was my first time leading a large raid and we won.  Yay!<br />

Dropped hammer and headpiece.</div></div><hr />
