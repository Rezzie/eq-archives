The page was relatively dark, you could give stats certain weights, there were check boxes for where the loot came from, and I want to say the default results were like 10 items per slot. I know there several out there and this probably describes any number of them =/. Actually I seem to recall the person who posted this had actually posted two links (for bear and cat) to the site and had already put in Emmerald's stats. For the life of me I can't find that post.</div></div><hr />

FWIW, Emmerald's List (http://www.emmerald.net/) now has direct links to loot rank using the &quot;High&quot; weights.  I, do, wish they had one for the non-High lists as well.</div></div><hr />
