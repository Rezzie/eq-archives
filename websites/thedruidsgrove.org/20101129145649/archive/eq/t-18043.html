<br />
(04-14) 14:25 PDT STOCKTON -- Softly crying, with her hands and feet shackled, Melissa Huckaby shuffled into a courtroom today and entered no plea as she was arraigned on charges that she kidnapped, raped and murdered 8-year-old Sandra Cantu of Tracy - charges that could send her to the death chamber.<br />
<br />
The formal charges facing Huckaby are kidnapping and murder, with three special circumstances added to the murder charge that make her eligible for execution. Those allege that the killing was committed during a kidnapping, involved a lewd or lascivious act on a child, and involved rape with a foreign object.<br />
<br />
Huckaby is accused of killing Sandra after the girl came over to her house to play with Huckaby's 5-year-old daughter March 27. Sandra was dead before her parents knew she was missing, investigators say.<br />
<br />
Authorities have not gone into detail about how they believe Sandra died. Publicly, they have said only that she was killed soon after she was last seen March 27.<br />
<br />
However, sources close to the investigation said Monday that the girl was deliberately killed at the Clover Road Baptist Church, where Huckaby teaches Sunday school and her grandfather is pastor. The church is two blocks from the mobile home park where Sandra lived and where Huckaby resides with relatives, and police and FBI agents searched it at least twice in the days before Huckaby was arrested just before midnight Friday.<br />
<br />
Sandra's relatives, already devastated by her death, said before the arraignment that they were outraged to learn that authorities believe the girl was raped.Take note, it's not only the male Christians who are violent sexual deviants privately while publicly preaching the opposite.  The women like to rape and kill kids, too.<br />
<br />
These are the same people who tell you to vote for bigot laws (like the anti-gay marriage proposition) and laws that condemn &quot;sex offenders&quot;.<br />
<br />
Christopher Hitchens really hit the nail on the head on this issue.<br />
<br />
Then again, &quot;god&quot; murders kids en masse and rapes too, so I guess they can rationalize that it's OK.</div></div><hr />

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2009/04/13/international/i080846D23.DTLParaguayan bishop-turned-prez admits paternity<br />
<br />
(04-13) 16:06 PDT ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) --<br />
<br />
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo admitted Monday he is the father of a child conceived while he was still a Roman Catholic bishop.<br />
<br />
Lugo surprised journalists by acknowledging he had an intimate relationship with Viviana Carrillo, the child's mother &#8212; just five days after lawyers for Carrillo announced they were filing a paternity suit against him.<br />
<br />
The president said he will not comment further on the matter, but will instead focus on his presidency.<br />
<br />
Lugo, 57, resigned in 2004 as bishop of San Pedro, capital of San Pedro province, which is the poorest region of the landlocked nation. Carrillo is from the province.<br />
<br />
In December 2006, he announced that he was renouncing the status of bishop itself to run for president. But it was not until July 31 of last year that Pope Benedict XVI gave him unprecedented permission to resign, relieving him of his chastity vows.<br />
<br />
The Vatican had insisted during the 2008 presidential campaign that Lugo would always be a bishop under church law.How nice to found out that your new president broke his most sacred vows and then tried his best to cover it up until he was caught red handed.<br />
<br />
But then again, he is a Christian leader.<br />
<br />
The only real surprise here is that he's not a closet homosexual, or pervert (see above).</div></div><hr />

Exposing them is fine.  Putting the extra crap in there isn't.<br />
 <br />
Although I wanna argue your second statement (And I'm crazy....) but I really can't.  They really are bigoted :shuffle: <br />
 <br />
I think you can chalk it up to human nature and not just religion.  But yup, still can't argue it.  Religouse and governmental people make the best &quot;bulls eye's&quot; for biggots cause their in the public domain.</div></div><hr />

Churchgoers More Likely To See Torture As Justifiable (http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/05/04/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4989944.shtml)<br />

A Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press survey released last week found that those who attend weekly church services are more likely than those who rarely or never attend services to say the use of torture on suspected terrorists is justifiable. <br />

A lot of religions seem to be based on fear of eternal torture, retribution and what not, so the concept is one they might be comfortable with.  And religious people tend to be more conservative and torture seems to be something conservatives are more inclined to like.  I'm sure religious people are more likely to support the death penalty too, just like they're more likely to shoot abortion doctors and blow up clinics.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

If the Sermon on the Mount is any indication of his will then it would seem that many of today's Christians are decidedly at odds with his teachings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Christians love torture.  Not just because they're conservative and conservatives today are programmed by their leaders to love torture, but also because they've had 1700 years of extensive experience with it.<br />
<br />
They're also the biggest advocates of the death penalty, especially for crimes they like to commit themselves.  Before she was caught murdering and raping children herself, I'm sure Melissa Huckaby preached vociferously in her Sunday school against those people, how they should burn in hell, be violently executed by the State, and so on.<br />
<br />
There are so many levels of hypocrisy and contradiction in Christianity that you'd need a large diagram just to get it all straight.  And it goes without saying that the major Christian sects today have little to do with the actual teachings of Jesus, who was a wimpy pacifist Jew, totally the opposite of what Christians are today.</div></div><hr />
