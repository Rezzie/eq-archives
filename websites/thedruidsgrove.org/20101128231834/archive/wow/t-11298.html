<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carath</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 1100 AP now. Got CH exalted quests done and got the 3 part set ring, back and mace. Also got some str enchants that puts me around 1100 AP. I get around 1500 when buffed with BoM and warr shout/trueshot aura so thats great =)<br />
<br />
Only problem now is my crit % is kinda low, barely 23%. Im full feral btw. Used to have 28%+ crit before I got the CH exalted set.<br />
<br />
Only parts that im not happy is my neck and head. Neck is one with around 10sta and +30 AP, head is Eye of Rend. <br />
<br />
At what point is it not worth getting more +str but focusing on +agi to get the crit % up?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iirc, it's at 1200AP when Agillity gives the same as Strength in Attack power. Seems like you have enough AP. I use Foror's Eyepatch for my headpiece and The Darkmoon Neckpiece (melee one) (10str,19agi,10stam)<br />
<br />
For Crit%, i heard each % of crit adds about roughly 30DPS...not too sure, someone posted this a while back as well.</div></div><hr />

Im just amazed i got this high AP with only 4-5 epics. Seen Genesis geared druids with 1600AP, doesnt seem that far away now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go with what your heart tells you imo. There is no set &quot;rules&quot; how much AP you need before you should start focusing on crit chance. :) And 23% crit isn't _THAT_ low. There are Hemo-PvP rogues with 12-15% crit chance that kill stuff like madmen. Just watch some PvP videos. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is totally offtopic I know, but you'll find this forum's a lot less &quot;elite-happy&quot; than the official forums (if you post about MC or talk happy about 1100 ap there you'll basically get bombarded with &quot;lolnoob&quot; and whatnot), and a lot of us are actually pretty... uh, still have a lot of gearing up to do I guess you could say.  Which is nice... I don't feel like a total idiot for asking for help about non-naxx gear.  ;)  <br />
<br />
And yeah, I was surprised at how my AP scaled even with me mostly collecting bear gear stuff.  I'm at almost 1k AP in cat now, which isn't much, but seems like a lot to me since I'm missing some really nice cat gear stuff (still using eye of rend, truestrike shoulders, the dumb honored AV neckpiece, that tiger cloak from ZG, etc.).  Cat AP come BC will be niiiiiiiice~</div></div><hr />

We druids have a deeper connection then the other brainless classes =P<br />
<br />
I played the 2.0 public beta, catform seems really messed up. Serious problems with out-of-range when youre trying to attack while stealthed, by the time you get &quot;in range&quot; to hit the mob he can detect you 10000 times...really annoying. Hope its fixed soon.</div></div><hr />
