<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Voronus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Any chance i can get some helpful info on what items i need to upgrade.  Im a 59 druid in a family guild which doesnt raid too often.  Ive about 10k in the bank but no idea what to spend it on.  I dont have any resist gear other than what i wear so perhaps that is an option.<br />
<br />
Come on guys and girls, help me out here. Cheers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I look at upgrades, I look at the combination of wis/mana/hps/resists in that order to try to decide what next.  Mana and hps usually win out for me over most everything else.  I don't know where you fight or what types of activities your guild does.  But I suggest looking at your gear and trying first to upgrade slots that give you no additional mana, and when you are looking at upgrades, try to get ones that have added hps and/or resists or wis, whatever seems most important to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>netura emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">talisman of benevolance-range. I can't reccomend this item enough. (CoV faction quest, soo easy nowadays)<br />
epic-primary. It may be boring doing the solo stuff and some of the camps, but its worth it.<br />
skull marked shield-shield, its really cheap, but not bad. (im biased tho)<br />
ragged hide cloak-back, good and cheap.<br />
shadel bandit ring-ring<br />
coldain skin gloves-hands<br />
<br />
On my server the droppable items i listed would go for 10k paying max prices, but if you shop around and bargain you could probly spend less than 7k. (depending on server, mileage may vary)<br />
<br />
gl to ya!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bixle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All those suggestions are pretty good, here are a few more:<br />
<br />
Fingers: Coral Ring - I picked one up for 1k, not a bad deal<br />
Neck: Sand Eroded Shell - decent stats + clicky pet haste, got one for 3.5k<br />
Back - Lodizal Shield - I got one for 7500 but dunno if you can find one that cheap easily<br />
Range - Beginner's Magic manual - decent stats and super cheap - just buy a hobgoblin surprise in the bazaar and the quest is trivial (lots of running around though, all in one zone), i got one for 100pp i think<br />
belt - chitinous belt - a bit of a sideways upgrade, has better stats and ac though - can buy for 200pp<br />
primary - soulstripper is ok - see them for 6k<br />
<br />
these prices are on torv after some bargain hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly, Soulstripper is an overpriced piece of crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Salacious Corpse 01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If it doesn't have ac hp and mana on it it's not really worth using imho.  I'd take ac hp mana and 5wis over 20wis and no ac hp mana on a slot any day.<br />
