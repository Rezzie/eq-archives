You plan on tanking anytime soon?  By the time you can get this shield (ally I think)... if mobs are quading for 2k..... I have seen 17k druids get beat down like little girls with maxed AA's.... AC means nothing for us..  Its the &quot;your not a tank, you suck factor&quot; that sony has built into the game.</div></div><hr />

I was able to tank the 2k hitter at the end of Skylance 3 back when PoR was the most recent expansion.  And that was before we got Shield Block and an increased dodge cap.</div></div><hr />

Shield AC is not subject to the Softcap.  The Higher Shield AC you have, the better direct impact it makes to your mitigation AC, it is actually worth it as a Priest (esp since we have Shield Block) to have A high AC shield as your secondary.<br />
<br />
That said, Bane of the Stonegazer from Omens of War was 60 AC.  The shield should be at least 60 ac, preferably 65 or higher.<br />

That's true, but the results when tested are actually quite disappointing.<br />
<br />
I tested between an 85 ac shield and the same shield with a 20ac aug in it, and came up with no discernible difference.</div></div><hr />

You would definatly have to run it through a parser, and unless you happened to hit a break point in shifting DI values may not directly see anything at all unless you have a fe wthousand hits with each.<br />
<br />
Either way that is not reason to argue that AC is meaningless on shields, nor that Katta AC shouldn't at least be equal to AC available to a single group 2.5 years ago.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree at all - what I'm saying is don't expect significant results.  It's good to know that shield AC yeilds returns above the softcap, and lord knows EQ is about the combination of many small incremental advantages - but shield AC is pretty low on the priority list in my experience.<br />
<br />
Having A shield in your secondary slot, with Shield Block 3, is much much more important than making the AC on that shield higher (unless, as you say, you happen to hit a break point).<br />
<br />
More is always better, and the stats/secondary effects on these Katta shields more than make up for the below avg. AC, IMO.</div></div><hr />

oh and remember that you can boost those stats with your powersource, even if it only is a little boost.</div></div><hr />

Fenier also has a Paladin Fiance who claims all AC augs for herself.</div></div><hr />

AC Aug for Shield or Sleep on Couch... not a hard choice in my book ;p</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I am in casual family guild and I have friends in raiding guild and we did Wizzy 1.5 in Scarlet Desert last night and the 3600ac warrior made it look like cake where as previously the other tanks (albiet they are casual but most ac augs are not from raids) took the beat down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree that the AC on that shield is quite low, especially when you can obtain better ACwise in the bazaar... /shrug</div></div><hr />

Getting one of those for a shield aug shouldn't take much time considering the benefit of 30 more shield AC.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Actually if this is type 7 might as well get the braaiinnss aug and put in it ac 20 30hps for simple one</div></div><hr />

Speaking of the Braaiiins mission.. WTF is the trick to that crap? Been there with a group of 5 or 6 of us like 4 or 5 times and get trashed onces the whole town swarms you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">03-23-2007, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Braaiins is a short timed event really...you have one hour (iirc) to get the drops that you need, then the town i raised against you.  And once the town is raised, you die....if you even manage to kill one more mob after that point you are doing amazingly well.<br />
<br />
     You need to have 5-6 people to do it smoothly and you need to be almost constantly killing.  Have a puller, have 2 healers (right click the rooted brains to heal target), and try to kill the healers first.  <br />
<br />
     You will have to wander over most of the town to get enough kills, so for those not familiar with halflingvile its worth taking a character for a walkthrough before the mission.  Also, VERY important, do not try and pull from the fields area.  The pathing is very bad there and you will tend to get a huge overpull/ wipe.<br />
