The horse nerf has greatly diminished horse usefulness for me.  My system has problems with the Luclin models, and along with the horse head and spell interrupt issues, my old nag is likely going the way of the dinosaurs.<br />
<br />
Which leads to the questions regarding the 3 general aa points after run3.  Most advocate regen or metabolism.  I have high baking and brewing skills and use stat food and drink regularly.  With a horse the 50% savings with metabolism3 would be a nice help.  Without a horse is the benefit still worth it?  Have regen or wis become better options that metabolism?<br />
<br />
I've already spent 1 point on metabolism and am sitting on the other 2.  I understand the scaling nature of metabolism versus others, making it more efficient per points spent in that sense.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First tier AA's are a toss up - some folks go for regen (I did - I'd take them back now if I could), others for metab., stamina or wisdom.<br />
<br />
Honestly, since the only cost 1 aa each, they're cheap to buy, so choose whatever. You can always earn more points and do something else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accretion</div><div class="date">03-03-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could look at Metab 3 like this.  Say average stat food costs roughly 100pp per stack (some are more, some less).  I typically go through a stack in a week or two, depending on how much I remember to force-feed myself or use my horse, etc.  <br />
<br />
Metab 3 will cut consumption rate in half, so I effectively save 200pp every 2-4 weeks, so assuming the 2 week rate, I &quot;save&quot; 400pp per month for 3 AAs.  <br />

Whether or not I use a horse, I still find innate metabolism extremely worthwhile because of:<br />

a. extremely long raids<br />
b. the rare-component stat foods I use (bucket of crab legs, triloun tail soup, mephit meat pie and swamp rat crunchies)<br />
<br />
Many of the guild melees I supply with mephit meat pie and tormentor stir fry feel the same way (partially because we all despise raiding/xp'ing in Torment).</div></div><hr />

One of the most underrated BUT very cheap to buy AA skill.  Personally I would go with Innate Regen then top it off with Innate Metabolism.  I like the fact that I dont' have to run to town or spend 100 pps everytime I run out of food.  Especially when your on horseback in the planes.<br />

Even on long raids, I never run out of food or drink.  With the new wisdom cap, I'd go wisdom for the second 3 points.  Regen never hurts either, tho not as important if you have a regen bp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With SOE and EB2, I can retrieve my corpse almost anywhere in the grey without enduring breath.  If you don't live in the Grey, (I did at the time) you would be much better off getting metab3.  Regen3 is a joke.<br />
<br />
3 points of hp regen on top of your natural 7.  On top of your Regrowth of the Grove, or Blessing of Replenishment...<br />
<br />
3 hp/tick on top of your 15hp/tick from a clicky BP is well, less than thrilling.  Whereas, your stack of food lasts 50 percent longer IE saves you PP.  I was ever so happy when SOE refunded my regen 3 with the modrod nerf.</div></div><hr />

I think this is a skill best suited to folks who use stat foods.<br />
<br />
Misty Thicket Picnics, Holy Cake, Halas 10lb Meat Pies, Qeynos Afternoon Tea, Kaladim Constitutionals.<br />
<br />
These are costly items but the +wis/mana/hp/sta/saves bonuses can be excellent tools. Unfortunately these stat foods cost a lot of PPs and horses help us to consume them quickly.<br />
Innate Metabolism helps these products to last considerably longer and is a practical skill that saves money.<br />

<br />
The stat food question aside, as a druid I hardly ever foraged, preferring to just go ahead and buy the necessary items.  I got tired of roots, vegetables, etc., all clogging up my bags.  Yes, I use to have forage bound to my left turn key, but I just got tired of it.<br />
<br />
Once I got a horse, it clinched it.  You can't forage from horseback, and I was almost always on horseback.  The horse increased the rate of consumption, so innate metabolism helped...a lot.</div></div><hr />

I swap between 4 hotkey banks and can only keep forage in my least frequently used hotkey bank...<br />
<br />
I guess it doesn't help having a monk alt with epic, so I had to bind two hotkeys to the same keystroke (reducing the number of hotkeys I can have by one per bank on any other character), but still...<br />
<br />
Even without horses, I like innate metabolism.  Misty thicket picnics now last me about 6 hours each, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I didnt go the route of metab I went regen and run 3 nothing worse then SoW dropping run 3 saves lives and indoors is invaluable, plus summon food/water comes in handy at no mana cost till you can make or buy new stuff.<br />
<br />
Personal call I wouldnt say it was a make or break AA =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The latest brand of top-of-the-range foodstuffs, Buckets of Crab Legs, require ingredients that are so inconvenient to attain that you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don't want to be using them without Metabolism 3.<br />
<br />
It's a luxury, but a very useful luxury!  ^_))<br />
