But yea... don't get your hopes up for that obscenely desireable High Warlord Staff.</div></div><hr />

At least that's the way it works on our server, of course about 10 of the highest ranking pvpers are in our guild so they want their guild mates to be able to get the HW gear.<br />

The best PvP'ers are not always the highest rank.  High Warlord is more of a time PvP'd award than skill award.  Thats not saying that you can totaly suck and make high warlord.  There is skill involved but, if you suck, you will not get into good PvP groups to gain massive Honor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anomaly</div><div class="date">10-21-2005, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, Badg is correct. Just another example of Blizz rewarding people who sacrifice their family friends school work and lives for Azeroth. For the Horde!!<br />
LOL, nevermind me.<br />
<br />
They also made it easier to gain ranks in pvp for the lower ranks. I went from Grunt to Sergeant last weekend with just under 300 hk's. Got me the Rank 2 Insignia, which is a MUST HAVE if you pvp at all. Damn thing is a life saver. Bye bye rogues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-22-2005, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats just how mmorpg's work.  The most skilled PvE'rs aren't the ones in BWL either, those are generally the people that can all play at the same time every night so have the time to camp up gear and advance to the next level.  Yes there is going to be some skill needed but its usually only required in 2 or 3 players and maybe enough skill to actually get into a top end raid guild for the rest of the people.<br />
<br />
<br />
However in both cases when you see someone in BWL gear or someone high ranked in PvP you at the very least know that they spend a lot of time on it.  If I didn't know two players I'd assume the higher ranked PvP player is going to win more times than not and I bet in general they do just from having more experience.</div></div><hr />

I've looked around to try and find answers, but either it's been around so long it's buried deep and I haven't gotten that deep, or it's just not there.  Could someone help me out with this?  Are the ranks based on how many people of the other faction (Alliance/Horde) you have killed?  Or is it tied in with the Battlegrounds?  I know there's one in SW, though where I have no clue, and I'm not really sure what it's for.  Do you just go in there whenever and duel with other people of the same faction?  Is there any place that has a good explaination about all this?  This really is my first PvP game, and it shows quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

My warlock is an Orc and looks so damn leet w/ the Champions shoulders/head piece.  I cant even wait!!!!  2 ranks to go.  My brother's Druid is going to hit Centurion today.  Last week he was rank 1 among the Legionaries meaning he was 1 standing below centurion..  He gained over 400k honor this week so there is no way he wont make it.  I was at about 300k this week.  The top 10 PvP'ers on Hyjal, Horde are earning over 800k per week.  Our first two high warlords were hunters but last week a warrior made it and this week another warrior probably will since the 3rd HW toned down his PvP to allow others to obtain the rank.  On the alliance side of my server there has only been 1 Grand Marshall and I dont think anyone on their side will make it today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes and no.  Yes, you can trade wins... no it's not quick.  Given the ammount of time it takes to get Rank and Exhalted Rep' this trading program would be horribly dull.</div></div><hr />
