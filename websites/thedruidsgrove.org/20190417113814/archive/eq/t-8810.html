<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kineada</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really depends on the mob.  How quickly does it hit?  Does it quad?  Does it riposte?  A mob that hits 1000 times a second for 1 damage a hit will invoke higher dps ratings from damage shields compared to a mob that hits once every 5 seconds but for 5000 damage a pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally, people use the 1.5 X DS number to quote DS dps.  This isn't at all accurate but it's what people use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakk</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You wouldn't even need to parse a DS, just parse mob attack rates.<br />
<br />
Simple models:<br />
40 point DS<br />
Mob double attacks 80% of the time.  He bash/kick rate is 30% as often as he gets attack rounds.  Attack delay is 3 seconds.  He hits 80% of his swings.<br />
That's 2.1 * .8 / 3 hits per second, or 22.4 DPS.<br />
<br />
Mob quads 80% and doubles 80%.  His bash/kick rate is 30% of his attack rate.  Attacks every 3 seconds, and hits 90% of his swings. <br />
That's ((1.8)*(1.8) + .3)  * .9 / 2 hits per second, or 1.6 hits/second.  A 40 point DS then does 63.7 DPS.<br />
<br />
If the mob is slowed 50%, your damage shield DPS is halved.  If the mob is slowed 75%, your damage siheld DPS is quartered.  Using half speed for a mob with slow mitigation is reasonable.<br />
<br />
If you want to parse how much DPS your DS would do in a situation, just parse the number of hits by NPCs on the PCs over time, and multiply by DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claeopha</div><div class="date">07-15-2004, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I parsed DS DPS twice; once in Umbral against the moktor (shaman slowed) and once in a MM Normal LDN (again, shaman slow).<br />
<br />
I think the first time I was using Shield of Blades on a warrior tank (so, base avoidance?) and clocked it at just under 10dps.  The LDN was with Shield of Bracken on a paladin who also stunned for aggro, and it came in at 14.<br />
<br />
For what that's worth.</div></div><hr />

Most of the time I'd rather use the epic clicky and let the tank keep a slot available for buffs that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kineada</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it really depends on your group's playstyle.  Back when we were augPLing through LDoN for wins (read normal adventures), our SK would insist on getting every point of DS she could get (bard, thorns, clikies, etc).  Then she would pull four or five mobs at a time...<br />
<br />
At one point, we had 10 or 12 mobs in camp, all unslowed and unmezzed (we stuck to ATK debuffs).  Everyone in group was tanking.  Well, everyone was getting hit  :eek:   I popped SotW.  No one died.<br />
<br />
Let's see, 10 LDoN Normal (65) mobs all hitting a 150 DS ... What is Tormax level dps Alex?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claeopha</div><div class="date">07-16-2004, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's unresistable damage and it's cheap, especially since the duration was bumped up.  If your tank (or group) has the buff slots, I don't see a reason -not- to use it.</div></div><hr />

Nothing like seeing a 100+ds on a MT, seen parses where that has added up to tens of thousands of damage.</div></div><hr />

230 DS on the MT, while the RZ(Time) fight, will do around somewhere around 135-175K dmg during 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xitix</div><div class="date">07-17-2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was thinking damage shields would be a lot more useful if they scaled with mob weapon/attack speed so slows and hastes don't effect the average damage per minute. A base 50/hit damage shield with the mob slowed 50% would do 100/hit, 70% slowed 166/hit, 70% hasted 29/hit. This would be similar to how proc rate isn't effected by weapon speed or haste and is instead a fixed procs/min. This would let damage shields not do pathetic damage against slowed mobs while only taking a hit in DPS against hasted mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like this idea.  The risk vs reward seems balanced now.  If the tank/healers can keep up then the unslowed DS is the way to go, otherwise...<br />
<br />
Making it fixed just seems to make it childproof, if you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

EQ Companion has a column that shows HPS and makes it super easy to calculate DS dps. Have your tank run it for a night and you can make your own graph.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellzii</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The dps from Damage shields can be nice against certain mobs in certain fights. However there is one CRITICAL balancing factor that no one talks about. To get this uber DPS someone has to get beaten on. Factor in you have to heal someone, count the mana blown on that and the numbers start to suck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnizmo</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhhh thats really not a good way to analyze the data there Ellzii. You don't cast a DS on someone and tell them &quot;Hey go let that mob beat the crap out of you.&quot; Its really more when someone is getting the snot kicked out of them you DS them. So the healing has to take place anyway, and should no be factored into the dps of the DS itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kineada</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If my tank has the spare buff slot, I will always have a DS on.  I do have clicky pants so it's free damage.  While it may not seem like much, it is THE most efficient form of damage available (even on slowed targets).<br />
<br />
And if no one has said it before, in battles where mobs have high DPS but low hitpoints, damage shields become a key to winning the fights.  Hell ... There is one raid level battle in GoD where damage shield damage will take the 2nd spot in raid total damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar Ange`deMorts</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally though, barring the all-caster root-n-nuke/dot groups of old; someone is going to be taking hits and needing heals anyways, regardless of whether that person getting hit has a DS on or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grevling</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At raids, we allways stack a BARD in MT group (for resists and DS), and i usually have 100 to 150 DS on bossfights. On unslowed / slow mitigating mobs, this really adds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Littlewing</div><div class="date">07-22-2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Bard DS = Psalm of Veeshan + Warsong of the Mastruq - 130 DS <br />
<br />
Slot 1 DS = Shield/Legacy of Bracken (DRU) - 40 DS  <br />
Slot 2 DS = Kilva's Skin of Flame (shaman potion) - 33 DS or <br />
Slot 1 Reverse DS = Mark of the Righteous (CLR) - 34 (reverse) DS <br />
<br />
total DS = 237<br />
<br />
there are lots of variations on this theme...including Ranger CoR as the Shammy potion is not terribly practical in a raid environment.<br />
<br />
*this depends upon the bards instrument mods and AAs but this is a fair number</div></div><hr />
