<br />
I mean like 1 thread each: Druid vs Rogue, Druid vs Hunter, Druid vs Priest, Druid vs Mage, Druid vs Warlock, Druid vs Warrior, Druid vs Druid, Druid vs Paladin, Druid vs Shaman.<br />
<br />
I think it would be great if there were like separate threads that people could look at for advice and strategy. Currently there's kind of a hodgepodge on the official forums where every once in a while someone whines about getting owned and they get some responses.<br />
<br />
I don't want to start 9 threads all of a sudden, so I'm asking if the mods think this is a good idea or if there's another way to do it. Maybe I'll start out with just one thread or two :)</div></div><hr />

I will start one for Druid vs Priest since I've played a Priest almost up to 60 now.  In fact, my Priest experience is a little more in depth that Druids so I may need some real experience to fill in a bit for me :)  Also, I think a Druid vs Druid pvp strat might be a little redundent.<br />
