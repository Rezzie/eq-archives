 <br />
I had EQ open the other day and then minimized it to take care of something else. When I came back to it, the window was impossibly small on the screen, so I ended up having to close it.<br />
 <br />
Unfortunately now, every time I run EQ, the patcher runs fine but after it finishes Vista shuts down the program.<br />
 <br />
I'm out searching for an answer, but will be periodically checking back here.<br />
 <br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
 <br />
Thanks very much.<br />

Check the properties of the shortcut, make sure its running as an administrator (if you arnt aready logged in as one) and in compatability mode with windows xp service pack 2.<br />

Only prob now is it takes for ever to log in after I have chosen the toon I want to play. Everything else runs quickly.</div></div><hr />

I box and the windows for my 2 toons seem to switch around at random. SK is always first window, and 2nd toon is 2nd window, but after palyign for a bit, the SK becomes second window.</div></div><hr />

If you have a widescreen monitor try lowering the res. to a common one like 1024x768 and see if EQ works (that fixed it for me).  You can than edit your EQclient.ini to see if your system will allow EQ to run in a higher (wider) res.</div></div><hr />
