<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yieu</div><div class="date">01-04-2009, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There have been ongoing pleas for a Classic EverQuest server, and the interest in such a server is now stronger than ever.  As a service to both Classic EverQuest fans and to Sony Online Entertainment, a petition has been created as a tool to generate positive feedback, and to see just how strong the interest is.  The petition was designed to establish that Classic EverQuest enthusiasts agree on a clear definition of what Classic EverQuest means, and to prove that there is enough interest for there to be a market for the game.<br />
 <br />
Those who long to stroll down Norrath’s well traveled paths once again are many in number, but it has remained a silent longing... until now.<br />

 <br />
Even without gaming mechanics being different now then they were then,  people know the content.  If progression servers couldnt survive why would a classic be any different?<br />
 <br />
Now if they are looking to open a server that isnt permanent and may change rulesets every X time,  be it months,  years,  etc...  then a classic could work,  otherwise it'd be a few weeks of fun,  followed by everyone doing everything classic has to offer a month or 2 later and no longer logging on.</div></div><hr />

If you're browsing from work, and your company uses a proxy to filter content, you won't currently be able to access the site due to the method it uses to filter proxies.  This may change at some point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second, those clamoring for &quot;classic&quot; EQ should take off the rose-colored glasses and try to remember what it was like back in the day when there were only two XP zones and two raid targets, when you couldn't heal or nuke in one of those zones, when you had to stare at a spellbook all the time, when dying in a bad spot could mean hours of recovery, and so on.  It was fun then, but it wouldn't be fun today.</div></div><hr />

I myself am on the up to Velious bandwagon, with Legacy of Ykesha, and the respawn with gear mechanic from Seeds of Destruction. And a couple other things, for their new server they are voting on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yieu</div><div class="date">01-06-2009, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting, but they are actually two separate topics.  This thread is about the petition for a Classic EverQuest server, and the other one is about SOE's voting on an alternate ruleset server.  I'll make a post in the other thread though because it looks like others in that thread also want a classic server, which is what the petition is about but the SOE voting may not include that option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which can include classic eq, classic eq with firionia vie loot rules, with 8 character slots. Classic eq pvp with rallos zek loot rules, as well as firionia vie loot rules, which can be quite nasty by the way. Also, progression servers, etc.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Actually the only ones that sound vaguely interesting involve pvp and/or alternate loot rules.<br />
 <br />
The only other server that would remain healthy enough (for a time) to maintain would be another progression server,  if you can convince enough ppl to distract themselves with it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yieu</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think SOE's voting for an alternate ruleset server will include Classic EverQuest as an option, because they have only allotted about a month for developing the server, and it would take quite a bit more time than that to create such a server.  This is why the petition is still relevant -- it was conceived of and created well before SOE announced the alternate ruleset voting though, and will continue on after that has come to pass if it is not the new server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khauruk</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After all this proclaiming the masses desire on every class board I read, you have *116* signatures.  That's nothing.<br />
<br />
Give up - it won't happen.<br />
<br />
The petition is not relevant, and it will never be.  Look at emulated servers, sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yieu</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After about two days since posting to class boards, without posting to any other game's boards (when most interested would be playing other games and not EQ), I think it's doing pretty well.<br />
<br />
Give it time for those who are interested to even find the site. :)<br />
<br />
The site was just released -- two days is not enough time for those interested to find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your message bored got awfully quiet and dull lately, huh.  Need to troll around here, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Go back and remind len that it is not he who makes up HIS board, it is the posters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Post this there for me, kk.<br />

As I understand the original code, it was somewhat cobbled together and there was a lot of time to bring that code to the point where advancing PC processors and vid cards could work on it.</div></div><hr />
