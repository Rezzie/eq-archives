<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaliane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild just got flagged for Ruins of Lxanvom.  I was told that there are some places in here that druids can solo and have chances at spectrals, etc. but I can't find any info on it.  i tried using the search feature and didn't come up with anything.  If anyone has some info that is helpful, could you please post?  Soloing frogs is becoming so mind numbing boring and I'm looking for something new when I am bored / LFG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyndfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can solo zone in of crypt of decay but your not going to see any spectrals.  You will get the occasional etheral and some diamonds, blue diamonds and raw diamonds at best.  Be careful of Greater Corrupted Puslings as they are unsnareable/unrootable.<br />
