<br />
I am really enjoying the increase in action over my normal grinding/ instance healing.  Especially since I really get to let loose with all my moonkin fury.<br />
<br />
I have noticed it before, but it was remarkably clear last night, that whenever I shifted to moonkin, I immediately became the target of every hordie in 100yds.  I know some people look at this as a real downside, with all the extra deaths that inevitably result, but I was finding ways to make it useful.<br />
<br />
For instance, during one assault on the BS I got moonki aggro on all the defenders, and backed away, dropping MFs and FFs, pulling like 5 hordies away from the flag with me clear to the bridge, I even got some heals from passing alliance priests.  My teammates picked off 2 of them before they got me down, and they were so far from the flag now, one of our rogues stealth assaulted the node successfully.<br />
<br />
I also find that there is no warrior on my server I can not beat with my moonkin.  I do not think this is shameless boasting, I think it is the one class that really has a strong disadvantage in a 1 on 1 fight with me.  Their physical attacks can't get through my AC and barkskin, and their AC doesn't protect them from my MF.<br />
<br />
So I have taken to picking on a warrior or two on the other side and killing them early, and then emoting taunts the rest of the fight to bring them to me out of pride, and then I kill them again.  Its a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

I think its my range they find so frustrating, if they stay at the flag I will pick them off from a distance, if they try to close I draw them away.<br />
<br />
A warrior that charges me to stun or interrupt is now a godd distance from the flag, and I will back away from him to get some distance, and hopefully he gets rooted from NG to allow me to back some more and lay into him with a SF.  As he draws away, if a healer doesn't come with him he is toast.  While I have the warrior occupied, the healer is super vulnerable to my team's dps, so more support has to come.  Its a vicious cycle.<br />
<br />
I think a big part of it is lack of experience of other players in combatting moonkins.  Warriors are used to soaking up damage or smashing casters, I believe it infuriates them no end thay can do neither with me, and once they get mad, they start playing stupid.</div></div><hr />

When killing someone, be it in cat, bear or caster I have a /bye macro and a /hug macro I hit a few times.  The next they see they come right for me.  They use their trinkets early and its another /bye /hug.  <br />

I know warriors hate being killed by druids, no matter the spec.  =P</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the kind words.  I am glad to be of service to other balance druids out there.<br />
<br />
I would also like to take this opportunity to say that I can at times, as has been pointed out, be a bit overzealous in extolling the virtues of moonkin.  I love it, and will gladly help others struggling to master the form, but it is not for everyone.<br />
<br />
There is no one BEST spec, because everyone's interests are different, and while one spec may be perfect for some it is horrid for others.<br />
<br />
Don't worry though there will be plenty more moonkin posts to come.</div></div><hr />

The problem is they are really ill equipped to do it, and as long as they are chasing after me, they aren't killing my priests, locks, and mages, or protecting theirs.<br />
<br />
I love it!  Like I said especially when I throw some emotes to rub it in, they get a vendetta and forget about trying to win, which I don't mind since I am always ready to take one for the team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are talking about raiding the end instances to get good gear for your moonkin, I would say probably not.  The reason being the good +dmg/healing gear will be going to dps casters (although I suppose if its leather the pool of available canidates will be smaller).<br />
<br />
I really can't say much about raiding since I don't.  You may get some good leather, but I doubt you'll get any damage rings/neck/trinks/weapons/off hands.<br />

Check the balance equipment sticky in the officail druid WoW forums and check where the stuff you want drops.</div></div><hr />

Eh, one druid specced resto instad of 30 feral / 21 resto isn't going to make much of a difference in the guild's progression, especially since everyone will have innervate after the patch. Spec how you want, and if they want you to be a main healer for MC regardless of your spec (like my guild), with 5/5 hotw and a set of heal gear you will do fine.</div></div><hr />

I have a 60 Moonkin spec druid and i really enjoy the dps i get out of him...as well as the outdoor advantages for everywhere outdoors, including ZG.<br />
<br />
my gear has come from all over the place<br />
<br />
rings from UD, lbrs<br />
trinkets from dm, UD<br />
legs from DM<br />
head from ubrs<br />
boots from MC<br />
waist from MC<br />
bracers from brd/zg<br />
staff from UD/HU<br />
gloves from ubrs<br />
<br />
at the moment i have a fairly good set for my role at MC and ZG..(where our guild currently goes).. as a moonkin...i actually started off WoW as a caster/healer and fully developed my +Int and +Spi gear and so here i am a battle moonkin for most instances and a decursive bot/healer for MC/ZG instances..hehe</div></div><hr />

You can't stop noobs from speccing a certain way, I pwn all druid types all the time. And they gear might not be the best either.</div></div><hr />
