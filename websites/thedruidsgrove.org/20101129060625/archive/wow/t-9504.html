Horribly.  Does anyone have any tips or suggestions?  Perhaps knowledge of a guide somewhere?  Being killed by the higher levels is understandable but I'd like to have a fighting chance against my own level and right now I don't even have that.  Anything given is greatly appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />

So to that end be conservative... don't blow your mana on lots of nukes.  Use bear, heal when needed, watch out for poisons/curses you can cure... heal early, particularly with warriors/warlocks/mages... and outlast.<br />
<br />
Talents can help alot... feral charge, nature's swiftness... all those good things... so keep leveling.  Keeping your gear up to date is also a good idea.... oh and head to filefront.com  and look for some druid pvp video's... the two most popular are innverateD and Force of Nature iirc from the WoW forums.</div></div><hr />

Paladins can be the worst to fight, you usually end up winning because of mana conservation but not always.</div></div><hr />

I rerolled on a new server at lvl 55 and releveled to 60, so doing it a second time really helped, but again... practice makes perfect.  For BG, get a group and play with them every night.  Our 15-20 main pvp'rs are rock solid and are one of the toughest AB teams on our server.</div></div><hr />

I'm in Shadowlords btw. Not as good yet as Rune, NQ, SF as an AB unit, but some of our guys are definitely up there. And put the above in a mixed group and we're damn good too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Felhunter is a great pet.  Im demon mastery spec'd so he gives me 60 to all resists when I have him out.  He also eats any magic debuffs I have as well as counterspell's my opponent.  That being said, I use the succubus more because she seduces, does good damage, and adds 10% damage to all spells and effects as well as my melee attack power.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">11-11-2005, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of my RL friends is a Horde priest and is really big on PvP.  I am catching up in level now, and hope to engage him in the BGs soon.  He keeps talking smack about mind control and sending alliance off a cliff.  Can anyone advise how to counter or deal with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fendicano</div><div class="date">11-11-2005, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is how to deal.  If their priest is MCing people off of cliffs, he is channelling.  Go in a group of 2 and have 1 person stealthed, as soon as he begins channel sap, bash, whatever. . .stun him.<br />
<br />
Comes down to this, if a priest is throwing people off of cliffs, he's not being NEAR as much use as he would be if he just healed people or did mixed DPS.  As he is not of much use, people will be less apt to protect him, keeping good priest protectors like rogues and warriors with the more useful priests.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-09-2007, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pounce, Mangle, FF, Shred.  You can get this all off in 4 seconds.  Most likely you will have 4 cp up, if not 5.  If 4, Mangle again, then rip, and quickly shift to bear.  <br />
<br />
If they are a caster, make sure to keep feral charging them whenever you can for the cast interruption.  Mangle is instant, and Maul is on the next attack.  Always have a maul queue'd up, and mangle whenever you can.  Save your bash for when you are low on health.<br />
<br />
At 64 with Maim, sometimes I'll build 5cp, Maim, shift out, HoT myself, root them, drop a MF, then shif into bear.  Depends on whether or not I want to start the fight with a few HoT's ticking (good to do to mitigate damage against high dps classes, especially warlocks that will fear you and burn you while you are running around).  <br />
<br />
Also against high dps classes, let your rage build up, and hit frenzied regen.  Thats 2500 points in health without having to lose a ton of health and armor shifting out of bear.  Add that to the 250 - 350 health that you will be getting from iLoTP every 6 seconds, and you are good.<br />
<br />
Druids right now can take any class.  *edit:  except maybe for demonology speccd warlocks with Soul Link and a Felguard.  Fel just hits too hard, and with SL, the warlock takes 20% less damage.*</div></div><hr />
