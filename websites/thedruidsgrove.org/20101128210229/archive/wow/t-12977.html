Regardless, I haven't had a thorough look and feel of the new talents but I'm positive that if you're going to PvP, you definitely need at least (imo) 11 points in the resto tree. Trust me, Furor is a definite must.<br />
<br />
I think using Rip or FB really depends on the situation in PvP. Particularly in group PvP in Arenas and premades, FB might be a better option most of the time in PvP because of how some player handle burst dmg and start to panic but if you're trying to wear them down with sustained dps, I think Rip might be a good choice. Personally I would go with the FB because big numbers make me fuzzy.</div></div><hr />

For lvl 70 i have this:<br />

As blue-posts show... Protector of the Pack will in 1-2 Patches not be connected to members of group.<br />
It will just reduce damage for a specific amount.<br />
If this change comes i would swap &quot;King of the Jungle&quot; with &quot;PotP&quot;.</div></div><hr />
