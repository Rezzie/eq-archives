<br />
I did a draft with the talent calculator:<br />
Could I kindly get some commments pls?<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?tal=000000000000000000000000000055323  21323020103531031200135100000000000000000000000000  <br />
<br />
Before patch, I used to have OoC, I know I am going to miss it, but I cant figure which 10 pts to remove from the feral tree to put into the resto branch.<br />
<br />
I am looking for a build that preferably can allow me to:<br />
1) grind my way up to 80 before going boomkin. (or should I go boomkin right away?)<br />
<br />
2) pvp<br />
<br />
3) generally i prefer dpsing but being a tank is a necessity cos our group always had problems finding a tank<br />
<br />
Currently I am geared like that http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Blackhand&amp;n=Garionn<br />
<br />
ANy comments/help would be greatly appreciated :)<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Take OoC if you plan to solo/quest mostly in cat to 80.  For tanking, I like the 0/59/2 build, but there are many other approaches out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garion</div><div class="date">10-18-2008, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">edited the link above, had a double http:.// in there<br />
<br />
I am currently geared in feral gear...going boomkin now, wouldnt that cause problems?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-18-2008, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get a starter set of Boom gear pretty cheap...buy the Boomkin rep set http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=743#comments for 85 gold, then go to the ah to fill in the gaps.  You can go to Kara in that gear, and get yourself nicely geared in time for LK's release.<br />
<br />
As far as a one-size-fits-all feral build, I would drop Thick Hide and pick up Primal Fury (a must have talent for bear and cat pve/pvp, imo), drop Primal Tenacity in favor of Infected Wounds (again excellent for bear and cat, plus pvp), drop Predatory Instincts for Protector of the Pack (PI only works in cat now, the tooltip is wrong; and PotP is a must have for tanking), and finally drop Improved Mangle for King of the Jungle.  KotJ is a far larger dps bump than IM, great burst for pvp, and you want the extra threat in bear.<br />
<br />
I skipped Shredding Attacks and took Improved MotW because I rarely just dps anymore, and if I do Rake has been buffed enough that I can do quite well without SA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have Infected wounds and it is awesome for controlling mobs who run away etc.<br />
<br />
We ran the headless horseman yesterday with mostly 66s and a 67 balance druid healing, and it was way easy, 5 kills in about 15 minutes!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once the Xpac is released, I'll re-spec for a cat centric leveling build that will include OoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The quick rule of thumb is that for cats, OoC is better, and for Bears, Berserk is better.<br />
<br />
And then have both at 71.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I finally got to tank something, the HH boss.  Must have done that 10 times.  The DPS told me they were going to not hold back.  With a 0/60/1 build and T4/badge gear, I had no issues holding agro as long as I used Berserk within the first few moments.  Enrage (DPS/threat boost due to KotJ), FFF, white attacks, Berserk, Mangle*X, that is what I did.</div></div><hr />
