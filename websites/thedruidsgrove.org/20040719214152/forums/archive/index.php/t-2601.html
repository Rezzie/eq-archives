Last night in HS with a friend, I cast Winter's Storm (??  the level 61 rain) on a mob, and I was surprised as could be when the 3rd wave killed the mob!!!  Did they finally fix this?  I'm sure it was the rain spell, because I got the &quot;slain by Tatanka&quot; message, and the spell damage messages listed the 3rd rain wave as the last damage I did to the mob.<br />
<br />
Anyway, WOOHOO!  Glad this finally works right =)<br />

You can get kill shots with the rain if that wave does more than 10% damage in one shot.  Until PoP we didn't have a rain that did enough damage for that to happen against most mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is a good spell though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
74% into 61 now, should hit 62 in a couple weeks, I'm not in any big hurry.  I'm set to 70% AA, and just enjoying myself, helping friends with quests and such, and slowly working on some tradeskills.<br />
<br />
I just can't do the raiding-guild thing, I get on too late for most of the raiding guilds on my server, and am not on late enough for the others.  So last winter I got into a compulsive, gotta-level, gotta-AA, gotta-tradeskill mode that burned me out.  The new Tat is all about fun =)<br />
<br />
Oh, and welcome back to you, too!<br />

<br />
I came back 3 weeks ago; not hard core playing by any standard but was lucky to get trials and tactics flags on second night back.  Tactics is a little dull but crazy exp.  i was 60 (wife had damn near delevelled me as a ToV scout LOL) and hit 62, now just grabbing some AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">08-19-2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CST, I usually log in about 10pm, stay on for 2-3 hours.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I have no PoP flags at all.  Don't need several of them now, but I'd still like to get some for the PoP charm quest, since all the LoY charms I've seen absolutely stink.  There are so few in the game, that it makes me wonder why they even implemented the slot.<br />
<br />
I've made about 70+% of 61, as well as 8 AAs and 25 pottery points since I've been back.  In just four weeks, that's a pretty good pace for me =)<br />

I still dont particularly like the PoP zones (other than their exp), and it has taken me a while to get used to some of the changes (like visiting Seb and being hte only person there).</div></div><hr />
