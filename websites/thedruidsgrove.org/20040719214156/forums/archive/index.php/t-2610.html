<br />
Also, is shrink stackable with Stalker so that I can shrink myself inside dungeons where the bigger size caused by the Stalker can be a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolodo</div><div class="date">08-02-2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest Mask of the Stalker first as it works indoors as well as outdoors.  The horse can only be used outdoors.  There is no issue with Mask making you bigger, it actually makes you smaller but increases your field of view.  <br />
<br />
I would also recommend you get the horse or lizard as soon as you can afford because it is great for outdoor use and there is no sit aggro.<br />
<br />
I use my lizard mainly in exp groups where I don't have to move or do crowd control.  I rarely use it to solo.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThornyEQ</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely get Mask of the Stalker (MotS) first:<br />
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; MotS is hard to find (at least on my server). I have yet to see it for sale in the bazaar more than once or twice a month. You can pick up a horse any time of the day or night at the bazaar stables, or a drogmor also at any time at the Gunthak lighthouse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; MotS can be used indoors, horses can't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Even the largest druid race (human) is still plenty small enough after getting &quot;bigger&quot; with MotS. (Is the actual size increase in MotS working, even? I've not noticed much of a difference, but I'm a halfling.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Horse and drogmor are not too useful for soloing outdoors; they have a start and stop time which tends to screw with kiting moves, and unless you spend a *lot* of pp on a fast one, aren't as fast as plain old SoW.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
Having said that, I'd still recommend you get a horse or drogmor as soon as possible, because the &quot;med while sitting and gain no sit aggro&quot; thing is really cool. I'd just get it after MotS.</div></div><hr />

Good indoor and out. Horse is only good outdoor and I hate not being able to /duck to interrupt my spells:P</div></div><hr />

A drogmor's head does not block your first person Field of View like a horse does.</div></div><hr />
