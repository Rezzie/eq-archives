<br />
But I just did a quest that was easy in Sea Lion form.  It's called &quot;The Vile Reef&quot; and you get it from one of the Trolls in Grom'gol.  Of course it's for Horde only and I was level 33 when I got it.  I don't know what level you need to be to get the quest but Allakhazam lists it as 37 Elite.  You have to get a piece of some artifact from the vile reef, which is right by the coast of Grom'gol.<br />
<br />
What makes it so easy is that, although there are mobs all over down there, there are none right by the artifact.  Just swim down to it,  Shapeshift to normal, get the piece, shapeshift back to Sea Lion and go get your reward.<br />
<br />
What quests have you found that are easier because of Sea Lion form?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll find it extremely useful when completing the quest chain for your Epic Flight Form.  There is a quest that requires you to chase down your target through a river.  <br />
<br />
Plus, it's pretty handy for when you do not want to wait for the boat from Feralas to Feathermoon Stronghold.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's pretty handy for farming stranglekelp.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's pretty handy for farming primal water.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's pretty handy for getting to the Coilfang Resevoir Dungeons.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, I like my water form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, it helps questing in nagrand and coilfang (before swift flight form)<br />

Plus, you look like a hotdog</div></div><hr />

And undead can hold their breath much longer than most races.  But the mobility the &quot;angry sausage&quot; provides is what makes it so great.</div></div><hr />
