 <br />
would like to see a corruption resist AA put in!... we have all the other resists AA's.. and corruption resists are fairly low compared to the others.. so an AA to increase the resist would be awesome :)<br />
 <br />
that is all! :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if such an AA line were to be implemented, based on the scaling factor, we would end up spending some silly 60aa's to get a bonus of 5 points corruption resist.   No thanks!!<br />
<br />
With 73rk3, I can buff a whole whopping 20 pts to corruption, wooot!~<br />
<br />
At level 1, I was able to buff 20 points to fire  :)</div></div><hr />
