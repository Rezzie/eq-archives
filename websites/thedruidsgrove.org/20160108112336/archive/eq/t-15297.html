<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ibndeath</div><div class="date">01-23-2007, 06:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wife and i recently returned to eq as a druid and necro. leveling has been simple and we have had our fun (accidentally pulled a 60 named snake in TSS mesa zone and kited it to death at level 51). a few questions have come to mind and i wanted to post my questions here.<br />
 <br />
so far we have leveled as below...<br />
 <br />
1-15 Crescent Reach<br />
15-35 Blightfire Moors<br />
35-42 Gor'Mesa / Stonehive<br />
42-51 Dulak's Harbor (the best place in the world at this level)<br />
 <br />
we made our side trips to the &quot;old world&quot; and hit cobalt scar, lower guk, Kael, etc for some killing but those spots are pretty much where we were and got rich.<br />
 <br />
Now I read the changes to aaxp and figured it would not be a terribly bad idea to stop at 51 with a little buffer insurance xp and accumulate some aaxp while things are fairly accessable. even con mobs offer us about 7%xp per kill grouped. the problem we are having is finding even con mobs.<br />
 <br />
there is a very significant increase in mob hp somewhere around level 46. efficiency in killing drops down (comparatively speaking) so we have been trying to up that ratio a bit. I have read a bit through these forums and elsewhere and I wanted to ask one last time from the current playerbase here (and i am posting on the druids grove as it is by far the best community)...<br />
 <br />
where is a good spot for killing level 48 to 53 mobs (dark blue to yellow)?<br />
 <br />
zone xp modifiers should not be important with the changes to aaxp, just the level of the mob. Prefer outdoors zone so we can sit atop our horses (it really makes a difference for mana regen as far as we have noticed). as necro/druid we can fear/aggro kite easily, pet tank, root/rot, whatever.<br />
 <br />
/sigh I really wish dulaks did not go almost all light blue/green. that was the best xp and money with evenly spaced mobs and nicely packed. we have tried cobalt scar (all light blue now also), kael (light blue except arena and higher areas which do not allow mez (screaming terror) to split nicely but there is some good pathing, skyfire has not nearly enough mobs, etc. I have been gone since ykesha original release so have little to no information regarding expansions after that.<br />
 <br />
my wife and i good players, we are decently equipped (exceptionally compared to when i last played) and pretty much know our way around the game. we may continue in gor'mesa or dulak for a bit either way (luggalds in the back are blue still and there is content to 55 in the mesa) but both seem to be a bit rough on the time vs mana vs reward. almost ready to say forget the AAxp once we have our required 6 (or 9 so she can do the foraging ones) and move up to the next bracket to make things a little easier. I guess that will depend on if i can get my rogue and monk pets to make us more formiddable to the increased level mobs.<br />
 <br />
anyways, its good to be back. thanks for listening to my ramble.<br />

If you want to fight in TSS zones, Blackfeather Roost is a good spot.  I level my 53 necro in Blackfeather Roost and PoN.</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree - you can use your mount - but not much room (especially in the beginning) for fear kiting. Good exp though and not bad on cash either.<br />
 <br />
Have you tried Seb? Iirc they still drop gems and are around that level. Not alot of room there either for kiting and you cannot use your mount there.</div></div><hr />

You're level 51+ now? Disease and Nightmare might be fun for necro and druid and once you hit 55 go to Storms :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jolet</div><div class="date">02-09-2007, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Torg Mines at the &quot;bridge room&quot; there are trolls which should be white/yellow at L51. Maybe slightly red. All single pulls, nothing there sees invis, easy for root rot or kiting as it's a large room. Not far from the Nadox zone line if you need it. It's about 12 mobs or so with a 20ish minute respawn time so you should have enough there to kill.<br />
<br />
Nothing special in the cash department but the AA exp is decent.</div></div><hr />
