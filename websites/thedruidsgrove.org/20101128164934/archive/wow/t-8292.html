<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aidon</div><div class="date">01-07-2005, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, Thanks to Boudicca for this:<br />
<br />
Seal form (level 18 ):<br />
<br />
This quest was a lot more time-consuming than the first, event though you<br />
don't fight any big mobs or anything. Again, I recommend having a refreshed<br />
Hearthstone to speed things up, and you'll probably have it refresh at least<br />
once during this quest anyway.<br />
<br />
Once you're eligible for the quest, the Turak in Thunder Bluff once again<br />
tells you to go back to Dendrite in Moonglade to learn about the aquatic<br />
form. So, you teleport once again to him, and Dendrite wants you to explore<br />
the depths of Lake El'eune there in Moonglade for a shiny bauble, then open<br />
it at the Shrine of Remulos over on the west side of the lake . It's a timed<br />
quest, and you only have 30 minutes to find it and take it over.<br />
<br />
Once you find the bauble (and it can be hard with the timer and if any<br />
competition is around), get to the shrine.  The shrine is on the western end<br />
of the zone, and Remulos can be seen guarding it. You activate the bauble<br />
next to the tree and then speak to the Night Elf NPC at the shrine. She<br />
sends you back to Dendrite to do the second part of the quest.<br />
<br />
Dendrite then tells you to find two halves of a pendant, but he doesn't tell<br />
you where. If you want to see the clues, talk to the Orc Wind Rider trainer<br />
to the South, close to the Timbermaw Pass zone.<br />
<br />
I'll divulge the locations of the pendant halves here (OMG Spoilers):<br />
<br />
Both halves of the medallion are inside black chests you have to open.<br />
<br />
1. The first half is located in the Barrens, at the bottom of the Sludge<br />
Fen - the pond northeast of the Crossroads. Really easy to get once you<br />
clear your way to the water, killing the mobs in your way.<br />
<br />
2. The second half is on the coast off Silverpine Forest, at North Tide's,<br />
directly west of the beached shipwreck. You have to swim FAR and DEEP to get<br />
it, so stop at the bubble crevice to refresh your breath, then keep going<br />
west along the bottom of the ocean. Fatigue sets in before you reach the<br />
chest, so prepare to die if you're not fast enough. I died trying to swim<br />
back to shore once I got the medallion, but the important thing is I got it!<br />
(BTW thanks a TON to Ahnn who guided me to the shipwreck, otherwise I would<br />
have spent an additional hour trying to find the exact location in the<br />
forest).<br />
<br />
Once you have both halves, teleport back to Moonglade, go to the Shrine of<br />
Remulos, and combine the pendant. Go back up to Dendrite, listen to him<br />
blabber, then port back to Thunder Bluff and complete your quest. Hooray,<br />
you can turn into a scary seal!<br />
<br />
Seal form is not useful for anything other than swimming, but it gives you<br />
enduring breath and you swim 50% faster than anyone else. It's great if<br />
you're fighting underwater, you switch over to it instantly to reset breath<br />
and switch back to continue fighting/casting/etc.</div></div><hr />

So im thinking where in the northeast? i am a newb so dont yell at me coz im dumb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nohomers</div><div class="date">03-31-2005, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, i finally got the half pendant from sludge fen. Now the other half is proving itself very difficult to find. I go to the shipwreck and go underwater when i reach the place that deepwater meets shallow water, i keep swimming and do i see a fissure? nope nothing just crap all. sry if im whinin a bit but can someone please explain this part of the quest in detail?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my reccomendation that anyone who plays download a UI with some form of lat/long coordinate tracker.<br />
<br />
For the half pendant in Silverpine, the coordinates are 29,29.<br />
<br />
The half pendant in Sludge Fen is easy to find.  Just swim around for a couple of minutes and find the grey box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mossrunner</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a tip for the water part of the quest.  I think I made it halfway across The Great Big Sea heading West before fatigue killed me.  Then another couple of deaths heading to various distances West attempting to extend my range or find something I missed.  <br />
<br />
The bubble crevice and the box are actually a short distance North along the main drop off to the Great Sea.  You can make it in a single breath from boat to box so you shouldn't have to worry about fatigue.  (I didn't, but I teleported right from the box when I found it anyway.)<br />
<br />
Now that I have Aquatic, I'm going to see if I can make it ALL the way across the 'Sea =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not possible.  You'll die of fatigue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t0c</div><div class="date">05-09-2005, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did the last part of the aquatic form (thanks to whoever posted where the damn ship could be found) and I found the box near a bubble fissure. Which was even more surprising was that fatigue never set in. I think blizzard may have changed the location of the box. Just a thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anpu</div><div class="date">07-28-2005, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed when I was swimming out west past the ship, there was an elite level 22 shark, I believe it was 'Reef Shark' inbetween the boat and the fissure. It's no big deal, just time it right and you can swim on past him, but I have not noticed anyone else mentioning this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">07-28-2005, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could be something new because I did this quest twice and never saw the shark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">07-28-2005, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The sharks have always been out there (and near the fatigue area in other zones' coastlines as well).  I killed them a few times for the heck of it (at a later level). :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aflat</div><div class="date">08-12-2005, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They have definatly changed the quest. Once you see the shipwreck, swim directly west, and look for the bubbles. The chest is right next to the bibbles now. You don't even get fatigued anymore. I just did it last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darbor</div><div class="date">08-17-2005, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm stuck just trying to make my way to Silverpine Forest.  I must be missing something here.  I'm taking the boat from Ratchet to Booty Bay and can't go more than a few minutes down the path before being killed by ?? MOBs.  There must be another way.<br />
<br />
Please help!  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">08-17-2005, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Silverpine is just off Trisfal Glade in Norther Eastern Kingdoms.  The best way to get there from Kalimador is to head to Orgimar and take the zeplin from right outside Org to right outside Undercity.  You'll then be in Trisfal.  Follow the road towards Spulcher (sp?) and you will soon be in Silverpine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darbor</div><div class="date">08-17-2005, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you!<br />
<br />
Did the quest.  Seemed like kind of a lot just for Sea Lion form.</div></div><hr />
