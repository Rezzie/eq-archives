I was originally going to add a smattering of Balance but I've been rethinking going with two heavy mana using trees.  Seems I either heal or do damage and I can do damage either melee or casting.  I figure I have time to make that decision though as I work on the Restoration Tree.  I do love big damage spells, but should I feel the need for a BOOM! I will make a mage alt.</div></div><hr />

Someone specializing in balance lets say, will get the &quot;hurricane&quot; ability but when can you channel in a group without getting hit? Since you are a healing class it not likely you will have a priest to shield you. So it just seems even distribution is the way to go for someone who likes to solo as well as group. <br />

when i first started out i tended to agree with that, and still do to some extent, however, it doesnt really seem to work that well overall.  I found if you try to distribute your points evenly, yes you will be &quot;well rounded&quot;, but you will also be fairly mediocre in everything you do, which is what started to happen to me.  luckily i noticed this around lvl 30 and decided to respec...   but once again i did a poor job a respec-ing in regards to my playing style becase i dumped most everything into restoration, then balance, and 0 in feral.  at the time i RARELY, dare i say never?, used bear/cat form.  several lvls later i discovered the wonders of these forms, mainly for survival reasons =)   so now im lvl 45 using bear/cat form often with 0 points in feral and im feeling, um, lost? misguided? i really need to do some work on my trees.  <br />
unfortunately the groups i play with lately are very demanding of my druid, always wanting heals, but also wanting me to tank (even in a group with myself, 2 rogues, and 2 pallys!!?!  whats that all about?)  didnt stick w/ that group too long, lol.   i love solo-ing (plus im guildless now) and in that respect i like the flexiblity of having high dmg spells, lots of pts in restoration for healing, and still using bear form mainly for the protection.<br />
i agree with everyone's comments that your specs should reflect your play style, but i need help b/c i want to do it all!!  it think i will work on it some tonight and try it out, maybe keep a decent amount in restoration, but beef up feral by taking points out of balance.  i need more points!!<br />
also, any help/pointers from anyone here would be much appreciated.  sorry i am at work and do not know the exact #s of how i am currently spec'd, something like 24/rest, 0/feral, 13/balance... does that sound right for lvl 45?<br />
thanks in advace!</div></div><hr />

When/If I reach 60 I will possibly look at the 31/20/0 build discussed in a another thread that looks appealing and goes along with my play style. <br />

I do not play much 1-2 hrs a day so by the time I get to 60 the expansion will likely be out and I may have to rethink my plans.<br />

<br />
With that in mind I'm currently working on the 14/32/5 spec as it has served me best for soloing but allows me to do enough healing in groups when called upon.  <br />

<br />
That's not too true. I'm on the Feathermoon server and many of my druid friends (and acquaintences) are moonkins. Quinafoi (59), a great PvP player, is a moonkin. Fugikuro (60), Lossemenel's er... /really/ good friend, is a moonkin.<br />
<br />
Moonkins, I find, are successful if you wish to go PvP. While not called on as much in a high end group... but neither are ferals (unless the melee wanted that extra 3% crit chance)... so usually both get stuck as main healer or backup healer. Which leads one to be tempted to respec as resto to get more groups...<br />
<br />
Cloth for +damage? There's a lot of good leather items out there for +damange... and also some for +mana regen. While lowering down to wear cloth is... not advised... well, hey. It's better than 'healing pallys' dropping down to wear cloth for the +intel and +healing...</div></div><hr />

I was a total WoW newbie ( as well as to games of the genre in general ) when I created my druid.  I created a few other characters, but none of them grabbed me like the way you could be so versatile with the druid.  <br />
<br />
If you do more solo'ing than not, I recommed going more feral with at least a few points in balance to get the Natural Shapeshfiter talents to reduce the mana cost of shifting.<br />
<br />
If you group up more often than not, or are more comfortable healing and doing damage with spells, then focus on the balance and resto trees.  You should probably wait till you hit 20 and get the cat form before you really decide what direction you want to persue.  The cat form opens up SO much IMO.</div></div><hr />

feral is the worst?  i dont want to flat out say LRN2PLY....but...yeah...<br />

I solo alot but really enjoy grouping and find I do a passable job as a healer. Now at level 39 I've almost maxed out the feral abilities I want, and am building the resto tree to enhance my healing.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that there are two things that make druids unique- our versatility, and shapeshifting. I find our abilities while shapeshifted enhance our versatility, to the point that many people I play with are envious of all the things I can do. Just today I was grouped with a level 41 paladin who noted that in cat form my shred and ravage strikes from behind would turn the mobs away from him very often.<br />
<br />
It's that kind of ability that drives my build thus far.</div></div><hr />

0/31/20<br />
<br />
This build works perfectly for me and my playing style.  In the newer 5-main instance runs, I can dish out some mean dps, the rogues and hunters adore LotP, and I switch to healing if the priest or main healer runs out of mana or needs backup.   I rarely use bear unless I've pulled too much aggro with an AoE or healing, and I've put no points toward bear-specific talents.  I can still pop out of cat to throw a moonfire to stop a runner from aggroing more mobs instead of chasing them down.<br />
<br />
I tried to give consideration to group-friendly talents such as improved MotW and LotP.  I'm not gunning to out-dps a rogue or out-heal a priest.  Instead, I enjoy working to improve the whole party and have successful, fun runs.  I opted out of Furor, which is my biggest regret, in favor of some other resto talents that serve parties and raids more effectively, imo.  <br />
<br />
I also do a lot of grinding for profession items (mainly essences), and being cat specced makes what used to be a chore (before I respecced to cat) now quick and even enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Being cat also rocks in PvP, and I can still change out to heal as needed.<br />
<br />
I also enjoy the extra points in Feral Instict, which puts me in fine shape to do stealth runs and stealth/solo instances.  All around good times.<br />
<br />
I love being feral specced.  The only downside for me is carrying around all the extra gear, but even that is fun to experiment with (crit vs attack, etc.).  Perhaps the best part is knowing that if I get bored with my current build, I can respec and go for off-tanking or venture back into balance without having to reroll and build back up to 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's almost how I am specced atm (14/31/6 (http://www.wowhead.com/talent/?zzLVhoZxGMssbdtI)) and I am tanking more and more lately in instances :) Only problem I notice now is that w/o points on resto I lack in healing... Like last night in Scholo (I was the only healer atm in this guild run), even with my blue healing gear they were dieing faster then I could heal...<br />
<br />
Question for feral peeps: Did you also put points in 'Feral Aggresion', 'Thick Hide' and/or 'Primal Fury' because those are the only feral talents I haven't put points in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">05-18-2006, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leveled up with an odd resto build through about 42, then switched to the &quot;full feral&quot; 14/32/5 until I hit 60 and changed to 0/30/21 Feral/NS.  Like it a lot.<br />
<br />
Primal Fury I wouldn't skip. When you combine it with the crit talents and Ferocity, and you can get long runs with a lot of Mauls in a row.  That really, really helps your dps and therefore your ability to both hold aggro and kill in bear.<br />
<br />
Thick Hide is also very, very good.  Not only does it work in cat and caster form, making you somewhat less squishy, but it's a MULTIPLICATIVE bonus with bear/dire bear form.  That means with 5/5 Thick Hide in Dire Bear form, you're getting 5.06x armor for your items, not 4.7.  I just got a trinket tonight with 150 armor on it which raised my armor in Dire Bear form by 759.  That's pretty major.<br />
<br />
Feral Aggression is fine, it's just not as good as Ferocity, so most people just skip it.  I wouldn't lose any sleep over that one.</div></div><hr />

Nope, Goa. Best feral tree talent is Heart of the Wild. XD</div></div><hr />

ROFL? I'm going with the 14/31/5 build and so far (at level 43) I solo beautifully and can tank well in instances. Not to mention I can heal just fine as long as I have my wonderful int/spir gear on me, and I can beat any class I come across in PVP, except warlocks. <br />
<br />
But seriously, who CAN beat warlocks?!<br />

With my success as being a dominate predator in world pvp, I dont think I'll be respeccing any time soon :P<br />

I am now 42, and LOVING balance. My only issue is I do seem to go low mana more often (when I was feral, the only time I was low mana was when I would duo with RL hubby). But that is to be expected, since when I was feral, I almost never cast spells, and now... :). <br />

I carry 4 sets of gear with me right now (not a big problem since a guildy fashioned me some 16 slot bags :). I use Item Rack which is great!!!  I have some pretty good gear for my lvl (46) NE Druid. I have a Bear set (Str/Sta), Cat Set (Agi/Str), A Caster set (Int/Spi/Sta), and a Healing Set (MONDO +healing and Int). Its easy to swap out and in when I need to do a different role. Main issue being keeping all sets up to date with the best gear. Most recently I went with my Guild into BRD as the MAIN healer...woot! (No Priests/Druids on-line so they brought the newb healer for a show ((they told me later they thought they would wipe))That was a blast...never used innervate so much! My Guild even commented on the GREAT job I did (mostly HoT's with some emergency HT thrown in for crit hits) But my point is, I was a main healer with healing gear, but was spec'd feral. That way I got the best of both worlds. I know this will start to change as I get into the end games, but I was happy that I could do such a good job (no deaths!). I have a similar tactic in BG when I want to go Caster (all day moonfire spammage):devil:</div></div><hr />
