<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I'm around 180 skill in both herbalism and alchemy right now, and I really have to say that I'm not feelin' the love.  I've got friends who are leather workers and tailors so I'm thinking about dropping my alchemy and going the enchanting route.  The only reason I can think of for not having done it yet is because I'm keeping alchemy and herbalism out of sheer spite (or bullheadedness).<br />
<br />
I've gone through Thottbot and looked at the higher end alchemy recipes, and not a whole lot jumps out at me.  It seems like alchemy is nice for melee'ers that solo and therefore need lots of health potions, but the occasional mana potion use ain't really cutting it for me.<br />
<br />
Part of me is considering keeping either herbalism or alchemy along with enchanting (since enchanting doesn't really have a gather skill).<br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Any high level herb/alch out there that can convince me of the merits of alchemy to a druid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am at 230-ish in herbalism and 225 in alchemy. Was pretty dissapointed when I went to find a Master trainer for alchemy, only to discover I needed to be level 35 to train any higher.  Some things that are also pretty dissapointing are that the market for raw materials seems to be better than the market for finished products. Although that doesn't seem isolated to alchemy, but all the tradeskills. So, if you are really thinking of dropping one of your professions I would drop Alchemy and keep Herbalism. Then I would pick up another gathering profession, like mining or skinning. Probably mining, since there seems to be better money in that.<br />
<br />
All that being said, I plan on sticking with Alchemy. If for no other reason than to be able to supply my friends and alts with some nice potions, and that I don't want to see all my time getting to 225 wasted. But you are right about the potions. There aren't a whole lot that get me very excited. If I were on a PvP server some of them would seem more useful. But being on PvE I think the only ones I will use regularly as a druid are the Defense, Fortitude and Wisdom line (along with healing and mana pots)..</div></div><hr />

alchemy = good buffs etc but crap for cash.<br />
<br />
i didn't play any of the beta's very long, so i dont know if the alchemy in the end will get you any money,  but if they dont, you can always use the potions for soloing.<br />
<br />
My guess, at the higher level of play, the other classes will realize how much some of the potions help for soloing / grouping / raiding, and eventually increase the income of your potion making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">12-17-2004, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm maxed alchemy/herbalism.   <br />
<br />
I honestly have to say if you aren't thrilled by alchemy from the get go, its probably not for you.  :)   I found great things to make use of throughout my skilling up.  Of course, some things are more obvious than others, like health and mana potions for myself and my group, but I also made use of swiftness potions in the lower levels, and when soloing, I'd use things like minor defense, trolls blood, etc.  <br />
<br />
At the upper levels of skill its mostly the same. Before a major boss fight or something I'll pass out the high level ac potions, health potion, agility for the rogue, Rage for the warriors, etc etc.  For myself, I'll use the int buff, which is better than the mage int buff at this level, but theirs eventually surpasses.  I'll use arcane potions to boost my spell damage, etc etc.  You get the picture.  High level mana potions and/or Dreamless Sleeps have proven invaluable to me in some longer encounters.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, I'll use other oddball potions occasionally.  Specific resists potions against a specific spell type, water breathing, invis, and I'm slowly but surely transmuting arcanite for our blacksmiths.  I'm making small amounts of money selling health potions and specific trade or quest potions.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, to sum up, It sounds like Alchemy isn't for you.  The trade is pretty much the same all the way up, if you don't enjoy it at the beginning, you most likely never will.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I keep my primary in silver from selling the items my alt forages and just concentrate on one character mastering a primarily production skill.   I have considered after maxing Leatherworking dropping skinning since now I buy most of my skins anyway or guildmates provide them.  Instead of skinning I would take up alchemy or enchanting with the same character since my alt can provide the supplies..</div></div><hr />

Now, eh, I use potions just for boss encounters. I'm a big believer if I can't take an NPC w/out being raked up on potions, then I shouldn't be battleing them anyway.<br />
<br />
I can take NPCs upto +3 levels, with the use of just one heal potions at times, unbuffed. I think that's pretty good. If I added the potions I can make, I'm sure I can play around with +5 NPCs, but I honstly have no reason to.</div></div><hr />

Leatherworkers/skinners seem to be a dime a dozen on my server, so armor kits/leather sells at very low prices.  For instance, I can buyout rugged armor kits at 60 silver each.  However, I can sell certain potions for 80 silver to 2 gold a stack, many of which are pretty easy to make.  I suppose making a rugged armor kit is easy when the mobs you are fighting drop the right armor, but at lower levels I think alchemy pays.</div></div><hr />

However, high level alchemy is pretty nice.  Major mana and health pots are very useful as are some of the miscellenious other pots (hunters and rogues will love you forever for mongoose pots).<br />

Also the lvl 300 uber pots are plain awesome, if a royal pita to make.  (2000 mana for 2 hours from one)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dumuzi</div><div class="date">04-12-2005, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Second the above. Until very high levels alchemy isn't a money-maker. I have 300 alchemy, and I typically make a lot more just selling ingredients -- it's the herbalism that pays. <br />
<br />
But, at high levels, there's a little money to be made in transmutes, and some of the potions begin to be more useful (stoneshield, mongoose, greater shadow protection, etc). It's not a ticket to riches but it's nice to cook something up useful when you need it.<br />
<br />
That said, there are a million alchemists these days, so the marginal benefit is getting smaller. I'm tempted to drop my 300 alchemy and try out skinning/leatherworking, just because everyone says it's bad. The wheel always turns...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have 300 alchemy, and I don't ever do a thing with it except transmutes, and only arcanite for that. It's more efficient to sell all the herbs I get and buy the potions. <br />
<br />
Alchemy isn't bad, but aside from a few of those high level guild/raid potions, there's not much worthwhile at the top end.</div></div><hr />

My rogue is 300 alchemy, and I would never give it up.  Of course if you have a number of alchemists in your guild, you could just supply the herbs and have them do the combines for you.  What would replace alchemy as a second profession?  Mining about the only thing I can think of, or disenchanting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They right in this respect as trying to make up new effects and ways to effect a person by quaffing a potion can have some quite serious game altering effects.<br />
<br />
I however think they could add some fun items to Alchemy that would allow a little bit of the 'Oh Can you Make me one of these?' type effects.  Maybe something like Illusion Potions which change you into different races and and really has no bearing on the game but it's fun like the thing that turns you into a Fireblog etc.  You could have different potions for Horde and Alliance and as a plus they might have some form of faction increase in the specific races hometown.  I am not saying potions that will transform Horde into Alliance and vice versa that would be unbalancing as there is a nice trinket that does that.  I am saying something like Potion of Illusion Dwarf (only useable by Alliance), Potion of Illusion Troll (only useable by Horde),  This was actually suggested in the Forums if i remember by someone else and I thought it was kind of a neat idea that has some merrit and fun factor too it.</div></div><hr />

For example, acids/lacquers for blacksmithing on weaps, or fuels/explosive ingredients for eng, bleaches or whatever for tailoring, different hardeners/lacquers for lw.  There are definitely other paths Blizz can take w/ Alch besides pots/buffs imho.  Actually, a much more elaborate web of interdependancy between tradeskills would be quite refreshing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not use all the tools at your disposal?  Im lv 53, with 300 alch and 300 herb, and use alch all day every day.  In instances, depending on what role I'm fitting, I will either use a +25intel, +25str or +25agil potion, as well as +250armor, +120health and +12health/5sec potions, all of which last an hour.  <br />
<br />
I wont use pots soloing until I have checked out the area, as it sucks to just buff yourself and then get ganked and lose it.  In one hour, I can more than gather enough mats to make those pots again.  I ususally have a stack of 5 of each on me at all times.<br />
<br />
Buffed with +25str, +25agi and the armor health and health regen pots, im quite strong in feral.  And the huge mana / health pots are killer.<br />
<br />
As far as making money, as with any other profession, develop a client base (as Jemm has done so well).  I know a hunter / enchanter that I once traded a stack of +25 agil pots for a +7dmg ench on a staff, and now he /w's me at least once a week to buy more.  I sell them to him slightly below ah price to make sure that he keeps coming back.  I have people asking for arcanite xmutes constantly (2 day cooldown &gt;&lt; ), and have people sending me mats and gold to make them elixer of the sages and elixer of the mongoose.  Also a guildie freind is a 300leatherworker and has sent me the ironfeather set and warbear pants in turn for lots of pots.  I'm not making epic mount type of money, but enough.  Alch ftw!:texla:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phalanx_era</div><div class="date">01-04-2006, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to put in my 2 coppers since I had 300 herb/alch and then dropped herbalism for enchanting.  I now have 275 enchanting (lvl 60 btw).  <br />
<br />
To the OP who wondered about switching to enchanting.. the best advice I can give is to say decide based on what your playing style is.  I find that at 60, I have less patience for venturing out just to pick herbs so I make potions only as I need them (I'd keep a 16-slotter full of herbs just in case).  At 60 I also spent most of my time doing instances and was doing the morrowgrain rep quest.  The herbs from the morrowgrain quest were always welcome.  Eventually, I hardly EVER went herb gathering and simply shopped for the best prices for herbs on the AH. In my case, it made more sense to pick up enchanting rather than keep herbalism.  Decent money can be made by just taking the items I win in instances and DE'ng the ones that are hard to sell (items with just 1 stat, or of the &quot;whale&quot; mostly).  <br />
<br />
I eventually levelled up enchanting by making instance runs for mats (VC, Stockades, SM, Ulda even) and shopping for cheap armour to DE for more mats.  Now enchanting is starting to make me a lil money, and is actually quite fun to do IMO.  <br />
<br />
I still use my alchemy for mana/health pots and transmutes.  I don't understand why people transmute arcanite. Seriously.  Invest in a recipe like Undeath -&gt; Water.  Transmutes are only 1 day cooldowns and will make you &gt; 5g profit.  That's double your arcanite profit.  I'm trying to get the Water -&gt; Air recipe. Yes, I'm sure you know where this is going :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry for my long post.  The point I am trying to make is that herbalism and enchanting are BOTH money making tools (though enchanting requires much more patience).  If you were planning to switch to enchanting, I strongly suggest not doing so until higher levels (where the lack of income from selling green+ vs DE'ng loot won't be as painful).  At higher levels, make your decision based on what your play style is and how you like to play.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, and good luck :)</div></div><hr />

It is good to start out early. I like that i have buffs that i can use on my armor 250 ac right now that make a difference when your fighting levels your own or a little higher.

Hey come on, it was just a joke. I could not resist it.<br />

I do not mind people who do not speak a language perfectly. I myself have been standing in foreign countries stammering along in a language that I do not know well and know how that feels.<br />

But the sloppy punctuation/use of whitespace and the use of &quot;u&quot; are something I find to be not necessary. If you do not have the time to at least try to format what you want to say correctly, why should I take the time to take it seriously?<br />
