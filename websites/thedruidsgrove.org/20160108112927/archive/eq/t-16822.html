<br />
I have been an avid charmer of the gators in Loping Plains (who isn't).  I also make sure to obtain the &quot;Rebuilding - Clay&quot; quest from Ryveron before a hunting session.  In the past I was usually able to get my 10 clay drops within an hour or so.  However this morning I only came up with 3 in an hour!<br />
<br />
Could I be unlucky or might the drop rate of the clay have been nerfed?  How has everyone's experience been since the patch on 9/9/08?</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I had a stack in less than an hour, and to day I was there for about 2 hours and only had 6. The day before yesterday, after the patch, I didn't end up with that many either. I think 7 or 8 in about an hour and a half. So, it was probably just bad luck.</div></div><hr />

My lesson exp session this morning netted me 9 clays in 30 minutes.  I guess I'm just &quot;jumping the gun&quot; and taking one bad day as worthy data.  :gunfight:</div></div><hr />
