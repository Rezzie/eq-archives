<br />
Would like to interject with a status update on what's going on amongst the team. We're in the process of smoothing out and increasing the frequency of spell drops. As you've no doubt noticed, some camps drop spells and some don't, which in and of itself is fine. (Part of exploring the expansion is uncovering where the things you want can be acquired). But even knowing where to go, the spells drop a little too infrequently and from too few camps / NPCs within the zones. This will likely be addressed in the short term with a quick fix and in the long term with a more elegant change.<br />
<br />
I've already mentioned this before, but as it's a continued concern I want to reassure the mage community that the &quot;summon item&quot; spell scrolls will be tradable after our next patch. They were switched from Tier 1 (vendor purchasable) to Tier 2 (world drops), but the no_drop tag was not removed. This was not intended and will be fixed soon.<br />
<br />
In response to the poster that pointed out that rare NPCs are not dropping spells, this is intended. The rares are already loot pinatas with plenty of incentive to kill them, and I don't like the gameplay that results when the most effective way to play involves the cherry-picking of rare mobs. Spells will trickle in from regular hunting within an area, not when you swoop in at the last second to gank #Super_Bob_the_Orc_Captain.<br />
<br />
There have been concerns about Tier 3 drops, but they're mostly based on assumption, conjecture, and misinformation, so I'll wait until the system is more fully understood to comment.<br />

Although its nice you can buy the tier I of most everything so that is a huge plus over endless spell missions and getting runes to drop.<br />
 <br />
I did get the Blessing of the Direwild Rk. II lvl 75 upgraded new group oak yesterday so that was nice.  Along with some other spells the 74/75 spells drop in Frostcrypt.  Its handy to be able to MGB the tier 2 oak at raids.  :wiggle:</div></div><hr />

Druid spells drops seem to be a rare commodity, i find it amazing thought that when the spells drop 99 percent of the time the spells that drop are of a class that is not in the group.  WTG SONy</div></div><hr />

Most notably, blessing of the direwild rk II. Very nice considering I've seen it once in the baz for 250k. There were also a few decent 215ish m/h items drop too. Nothing spectacular though.</div></div><hr />
