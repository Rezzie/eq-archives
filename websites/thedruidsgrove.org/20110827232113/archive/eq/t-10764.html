I am in a casual/family type guild. Not a lot of PoP flags. I do not have Omens of War, and have not ordered Dragons of Norrath, as of yet. I have been retired for a bit, but feel a strong urge to play. I would appreciate some upgrade ideas for my equipment. I know I am pretty ghetto for a 65 Druid. ;) But for the most part I am happy. I want to make sure that I am staying in game before I buy the 2 newer expansions, although, I will be honest, it is DoN that is luring me back. ;)<br />

Thanks in advance!<br />

<br />
Ornate stuff, and Bazaar bought OoW gear might be a good option for you. Also since Umbral Planes is a hotspot now you could head over and pick up an Elysian tunic. If Ornate isn't readily available for some reason, Riwwi has some drops you might like if you have GoD. You could camp the FT necklace from Natimbi with friends. Getting access to Sol Ro now is so easy it's silly, so that zone opened up to you as well.<br />

From Riwwi off the Night Watchman:<br />

leggings (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68386)<br />
armwraps (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68402)<br />
<br />
zonewide drop in Riwwi: spell haste tunic (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68405) <br />
  <br />
If you do decide to come back and order OoW, post here and we can make loads of suggestions.  :rose:</div></div><hr />
