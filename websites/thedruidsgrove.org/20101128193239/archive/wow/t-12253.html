<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lunamaria</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone, this is my first post. I am currently starting a druid (just lv8) and is planning to be a resto/balance druid with lunar guidance and moonglow at 70. Not really new to the game, have a hunter and a resto shaman (both 70), but really new to being a druid! :(  So is it really possible to be a balance druid when lvling? Because I heard my friend saying that it was too difficult to a point that he completely gave up the idea of lvling a druid. It kinda scares me but I am up for some challenge, just want to make sure it's not insurmountable. :wink:</div></div><hr />

I am lvl 26.  I can only play about 4 hours a day right now, and I get about a lvl a day.  So I guess I don't think it is hard at all.  I rarely use my bear or cat form.  Only really use cat to move around stealthily.  This is my first character and I don't think it is hard at all.</div></div><hr />

With the speed up of leveling post 20 and particularly after 30 its much much easier to do.  I level my balance druid with my wife's character.  She's a feral druid so its a very nice combination for us.  The biggest hassle about it is buying all of the water that I need.  I've taken to swinging out my mage prior to working with my wife... giving her a few stacks of food and water and then loading up my balance druid.<br />

The down time due to drinking is the biggest complaint about balance druids.  They do lots of good damage.  They are certainly viable, but people whine about how much time they sit down to drink or heal.  If combined with a secondary melee class its much better for mana use etc.</div></div><hr />

Back when Innervate was in the resto tree. Back when hurricane was the top of the balance tree.<br />

And if i could do it resto back then, anyone can do it balance now. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sasuke</div><div class="date">12-12-2007, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually don't even use a lot of water or any drink that much.  I am an alchemist, so I carry plenty of potions.  And I have some decent gear that restores my mana pretty quickly.  It is rare really that I have to sit and drink.  And the water and milk that I do have, I have gotten from questing.  I always looked for chests and water barrels and such.  I do a lot of just swimming around under water with my water form.  Since I don't need breath, as long as there isn't anything that is going to kill me, I farm stranglekelp, and find lots of underwater hidden treasures.  I guess I really don't know any different since this is my first character, but I really really like being a druid.  And I am glad I went balance.</div></div><hr />

I see other druids have beaten me to the mark but I'd just like to reaffirm, yes, it's easy enough to level as balance :&gt;<br />
