<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-30-2008, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I asked before, but I think it will happen this time.  I'm thinking about switching to Resto as our guild seems to be short healers.  I'd like to be able to heal reg 5-mans and be (at least) our &quot;third healer&quot; on our Kara runs.  Later I might do heorics, but let's take baby steps for now.<br />
<br />
As a feral spec, my healing kit has ~9K mana, 160MP5 (in combat) and ~1100 +healing.  Gem'd with &quot;green&quot; quality gems and no enchants (except for the head enchant).  Most of my gear slots have &quot;scores&quot; that compete with those in the top 5 positions in this gear list (http://www.lootrank.com/wow/rank.asp?Cla=1024&amp;s7=1&amp;s8=4&amp;Art=0&amp;s1=1&amp;s2=4&amp;Slot=0&amp;j4=1&amp;s3=1&amp;s4=4&amp;Max=15&amp;s5=1&amp;s6=4&amp;Gem=2&amp;j5=1&amp;j6=1&amp;Str=0&amp;Arm=0&amp;Exp=0&amp;dps=0&amp;mp5=10&amp;Sta=0.08&amp;Def=0&amp;mcr=0&amp;odps=0&amp;heal=2&amp;Agi=0&amp;Dod=0&amp;mhit=0&amp;ddps=0&amp;spc=0&amp;Int=5&amp;blv=0&amp;map=0&amp;hdps=0&amp;sph=0&amp;Spi=4&amp;blr=0&amp;rap=0&amp;rdps=0&amp;spd=0&amp;par=0&amp;fap=0&amp;msp=0&amp;fid=0&amp;Sckm=0&amp;res=0&amp;arp=0&amp;osp=0&amp;frd=0&amp;mh=0&amp;rsp=0&amp;ard=0&amp;axb=0&amp;nad=0&amp;bob=0&amp;shd=0&amp;gub=0&amp;has=0&amp;mab=0&amp;spp=0&amp;swb=0&amp;Ver=4) (rep, BoE crafted, or world drop).  A few are better than #1 position (drops I picked up while tanking).  Still need to get a bit more LC rep (need ~3K) so I can pick-up two LC prayer books (and maybe the LC pants), in the meantime I have two nice quest rewards as trinkets.  I have a Rejuv idol (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25643) and the Raven Goddess idol (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32387).  Not sure which is &quot;better&quot;.  Probably the Raven idol.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where to spend my talent points in a few cases.  I was thinking about... this 17/0/44 build (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0tzru0bZZxMIxcqbeot).  But I really don't have a clue where to put points in the balance tree.  I don't care too much about my personal DPS (for dailies), as I can always bring my hunter out of storage and use him to as a money collector.<br />
<br />
Any guidance would be great.  If I remember, tonight I'll log off in my healing kit, so you can see what I have.<br />
<br />
Thanks...</div></div><hr />

It is on my &quot;to do&quot; list.  But, for now, I'm trying to outfit myself without depending on drops.  From what I've read, the Raven Goddess idol isn't so bad, though not as good as the Lifebloom idol.I would drop Improved Tranquility ... from my experience I maybe have used Tranquility once or twiceI wondered about that.  I was thinking I might keep it until I feel a bit more comfortable (confident) healing.  Besides, where else would I put the points?  Say I only had 41 points in Resto (rather than the above 44), where would you put 20 points in Balance to help with group PvE?</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Misha&amp;n=Magellan<br />
<br />
I'm quite able to solo and PvE with the 17 points that I have in Balance.   I'm not topping any Damage Meters, mind you, but I'm often pleasantly surprised at my abilities when in a crunch.  ;) <br />
<br />
If I had 3 extra points to use in the Balance Tree, I would:<br />
<br />
1 point for Nature's Grasp <br />
1 point for Insect Swarm<br />
3 points for Celestial Focus<br />
<br />
I love Celestial Focus, and wish I had all 3 points invested in it, but I've played around with my build so much, I'm just so tired of re-speccing and quite happy to be happy with what I have now. ;)</div></div><hr />

Also, Nature's Focus seems like an odd talent, is it for PVP??  Why not just use Barkskin if you are worried about interrupts?  I read that many take Natural Shapeshifter to save mana when shifting into tree (for whatever reason) and only put 2 points into Nature's Focus (as a talent point dump).</div></div><hr />

It was probably because of Nurturing Instinct and Heart of the Wild.</div></div><hr />

No, don't sweat it.  What you lose in bonus healing you more than gain in healing efficiency and utility.  :)</div></div><hr />

What you lose in bonus healing you more than gain in healing efficiency and utility.  :)The loss in +healing doesn't really bother me too much, but the big ding to my mana pool seems crazy.  Can I heal normal 5-mans and/or be the &quot;third healer&quot; in kara with only 6K mana?<br />
<br />
Maybe I need to gem for +int rather than +healing?  Or enchant for +int?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-31-2008, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking at one my guild's resto Druids (0/0/61 build), he has 1400 +healing and only ~150MP5 way more health and mana.  I wonder if I have the stat &quot;weights&quot; correct when I'm looking for gear.  Here's what I've done...<br />
<br />
 MP5 == 10 (this is what all the other stat values are relative to)<br />
 int == 5<br />
 spr == 4<br />
 heal == 2pts  (I think this should be 1, but it seemed low)<br />
 sta == .1 (sort of a tie-breaker stat)<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep MP5 at 10, what would you set the other 3 (or 4) values to? Maybe I need to increase int relative to MP5?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">06-01-2008, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I prioritize stats this way:<br />
<br />
1. +heal ~ 10<br />
2. int/spirit ~ 5 each<br />
<br />
and ignore the rest as they tend to take care of themselves.  Spirit is better than raw mp5 because of Innervate, and Int is dual purpose since 2.4 because it boosts mp5 quite a bit as well as increasing your mana pool.<br />
<br />
With the use of potions and innervate, unbuffed mp5 &gt; 100 while casting (from mousing over the mana regen stat in your character screen) is enough to start healing Kara and heroics.<br />
<br />
Most fights (95% +) are too short for mp5 to be a factor.  In those fights the size of your mana pool is far more important, especially if you have to throw some big heals.  You could patch heal Kara (without dps'ing) with only 6k mana and +1000 heals, but you would have a very difficult time healing heroics unless the pulls were very controlled to limit incoming damage on the tank and/or the party.<br />
<br />
As far as spec I ended up deciding to go 0/0/61 because I am a noob and found that I really could not afford to start tree healing without every healing tool I could carry.  I don't think my spec is unique at all but FWIW. (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Kel%27Thuzad&amp;n=Oiysters)<br />
<br />
Soloing is rather hellish but as I get better at my job I may be able to respec to something more utilitarian later.  Until then I just group for dailies with friends or work on an alt.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

I don't throw it away. I made 3 sets now. An allround healing set (489 int, 503 spi, 1695 healing, 209 mp5), a maxhealing (1755, 194 mp5) set, and one for intensive fights..the Spirit/Mana set. (1555 healing, 567 spirit with that set, 242 mp5).<br />
<br />
I tried the 19/0/42 build (very nice for grinding and on Leo), but now back to 61 in resto again.</div></div><hr />

I do solo quite often, and been able to easily take down a quick re-spawning mob or few on the Isle. ;)  <br />

<br />
I will admit this, and please, no lectures:<br />
<br />
I never use Barkskin.  Gasp!   I know!  The Shame!  :nono:  TBH, I've just never gotten into the habit of using it.</div></div><hr />

I've been using your build for the past couple of days while I push the tree the last couple of steps to 70 and while I'm sure some of the nuances are still lost on me it does seem to be a pretty useful &quot;healer with utility&quot; build. Myself and a lvl57 rogue had a blast running round Hellfire peninsula seeing just how many orcs he could dump on me before we, well I, was finally overwhelmed (about 6 as it turns out).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad you like it!  I certainly haven't perfected my spec, but this one seems to work just ducky for my playing habits.<br />
<br />
I wish I were more comfortable with raid healing using a &quot;Dreamstate&quot; build, to allow for much better soloing strength, but alas, I'm just not that good - yet.  <br />
