<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know of any type of slow that a druid can use, whether it be weapon proc or clickable item??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah. Take the place of a Shaman or Cleric in an EXP group..<br />
<br />
You will slow them down considerably.<br />
<br />
Just Kiddin...<br />
<br />
No.. Druids do not get any form of slow via spell or item that I can think of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ainwen63</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Afaik, there are no spells nor items that give us the ability to slow in any form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, if you find an animal that can hold weapons, you can charm it and give it a slow proc weapon (like locustlure).<br />
<br />
Booboo might be able to hold weapons now too; I'm not sure if the Booboo-can-wield patch of almost a year ago has been nerfed.  The disadvantage with Booboo is that you lose the weapon, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, if you can get a pet, give it a &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6830&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Di'zok Oracle Shillelagh&lt;/a&gt;, best slow on a weapon that I know of.  And I'm pretty sure booboo will wield weapons, but I'm too cheap to lose them when he dies or I zone. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just make sure the pet you give the weapons to is high enough level for the weapon to proc.  Di'zok oracle shillelagh won't proc until 51.  Locustlure won't proc until 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Excellent info. Thats why I come here. <br />
<br />
Now you got me wondering. I thought NPC's had no min lvl to proc weapons. On a side note, wouldnt a PGT make an excelent weapon for dmg midigation on a pet (procs a small rune shield). <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Confirmed. charmed mobs do not have to be of level for items to proc. Just tested it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Last I checked, charmed NPCs won't proc unless they are high enough level.  I'm surprised they removed this restriction, because it allows for some immensely powerful low level pets.<br />
<br />
As for the PGT, it's damage mitigation is pathetic.  It won't make any difference unless you're really low level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Apocalypse Criterion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your charmed pet must have the sufficient level or you will get a message similar to one which you get if you use a weapon you are not high enough to proc.<br />
<br />
Once the charm breaks however it can proc like a bitch.<br />
<br />
So: Pets must be the right level, free NPC's do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the restriction has been removed, it was sometime after this date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Who needs slow?  Hand + Illumination will lower ATK so much that slow isn't required.  We have damage shields.  We want fast hitting, low damage output mobs.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Heh.  If only that was even remotly true.  While hand + illumination will outagro turgur's and cripple, both combined don't even come close to being as effective as either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Saffun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Let it be known that the Dizok slow proc is useful and procs for me with dire charmed pets.<br />
<br />
In fact if you have dire charm and havent gotten your pet stun and slow procing weapons your missing out.<br />
<br />
One thing though i wouldn't give dire pets in planes any expensive weapons, they die too easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ps. In case you dont understand this after you are almost done with your play session break charm and kill pet then you get weapons back.<br />
<br />
Never give weapons to boo boo unless you dont need them again. No way to get them back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh?  Are you saying Hand of Ro + Ro's Illumination &lt; Cripple?  I find that difficult to believe, since Cripple only lowers STR, DEX, AGI and AC (no ATK decrease).  I have seen some evidence here that ATK lowering makes a measurable difference, but I have not seen evidence that Cripple does anything other than reduce the rate of special attacks.<br />
<br />
Saffun says:  Ps. In case you dont understand this after you are almost done with your play session break charm and kill pet then you get weapons back.<br />
<br />
Just remember the risk if you drag the pet too far, due to the ages old warp-to-spawn-point-when-stuck bug.  I've lost at least a dozen Velium Swiftblades to the bug over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The restriction has NOT been lifted.  I gave a zelniak in dawnshroud a di'zok oracle shillelagh a couple minutes ago, and just got the &quot;Your pet's will is not sufficient to command its weapon&quot; message.<br />
<br />
The shillelagh has a minimum level to proc of 51 (see http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=5714 ).  We know the dire charm level cap is below 51 (45 or 46 I think?).  I'm convinced anyone who claims a dire charmed pet was able to proc with a di'zok oracle shillelagh is mistaken.<br />
<br />
Saffun: What exactly did you dire charm and give the shillelagh to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>L1ndara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&lt;strong&gt;Eh? Are you saying Hand of Ro + Ro's Illumination &lt; Cripple?

 <br />
  Lowering, I assume strength, does seem to lower mobs damage, but I was thinking specifically of raid mobs (with special attacks.)  I never bother using illumination on anything but a boss mob.  We had an uncrippled Rydda'Dar that rampaged pretty much every attack round, cripple him and you'll see a couple rampages in the entire fight making cripple &gt; slow for that particular mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OK No more talking about procing weapons and charmed pets. <br />
<br />
We have seen enough nurfs in the past couple months. Lets not give them one more FUN part of the game to take away from us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A lot of times when I read this kind of stuff it goes WAY over my head.  After having some feedback from helpful friends, I have a question. <br />
<br />
What kinds of mobs do you successfully use the two ro spells stacked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I use them on almost any mob that isn't fire resistant where I expect the fight to last at least, say, two minutes.<br />
<br />
It may or may not be worth it, but it makes me feel good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Role Meggido</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Overnuke every once and a while and you effectively &quot;slow&quot; the dps on the main tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;I never bother using illumination on anything but a boss mob.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Try Hand and Light on yard trash and you will notice some significant damage output gimapage from mobs.  PoP mobs have low ATK ratings but high max damage values.  Puting their ATK much lower than your tanks AC tends to make them hit closer to min damage.<br />
<br />
I was helping a guildie (wizzy) in PoV last night get some exp.  I would pull a golem with snare, Hand + Light then Summer's nuke kite.<br />
<br />
The golem's melee damage had gotten so gimped that I stopped bothering to avoid melee and just ran through it (taking a couple 150's).<br />
<br />
i.e. Line kiting instead of a big oval.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ladred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">At the recent Fan Faire, I mentioned to a couple of devolopers the idea of an animal only slow spell. It's a great idea and falls in line with the druid ideals.<br />
<br />
Please email SoE and /feedback this idea. If enough people voice it, then maybe we can get some sort of slow spell. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zukasil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yep, a great idea..... necros get undead slow because they MASTER undead... well we MASTER animals so i think it would be nice to have a slow animal spell =P... I just got done e-mailing verant about the idea as well.... i think everyone that reads this should do the same =)</div></div><hr />
