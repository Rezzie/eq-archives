Right now I m playing with new char ( druid lvl60 ) and my guild is not developed enough yet for things like ony , naxx and aq40 so we are doing zg . Anyway we have problems with Snake boss in there . Last 2 weekends we were there and both time failed .<br />
<br />
I was leader than and I made some dps order and mark 4 other snakes ( his guards ) anyway he killed us . 20 of us were there and we failed . Is there any guide how to kill that boss , how to tank him , cast and so on ??? If you know how to do it please post it here .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get your main tank to pull the snake boss off to the left of the stairs (facing the altar) and well away from the raid. Have a couple of healers assigned to keep the MT up while the rest of the raid deals with the guards. Reason we pull him to the side is he casts an arcane explosion AE, so you don't want people taking any more damage than you need to at the start. <br />
<br />
The guards are all pulled down the stairs. Druids and mages hibernate or sheep all the guards but one; have an off tank assigned to that one ahead of time. All your DPS needs to be concentrated on that first guard and the other healers in the raid keep the off tank alive. Once the first guard is dead, the off tank moves to the next. Rinse and repeat until all the guards are dead. <br />
<br />
At this point, all your DPS can focus on the snake boss. We do ranged dps on him until 50% to avoid the arcane explosion. Once he gets to 50% he transforms into a snake and no longer does the AE arcane explosion, now he does an AE posion cloud. The MT can wait til he does his AE and then pulll him out of the cloud so that melee don't take AE poison damage. Just burn him down, he's not too tough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
( the raid stands by the fountain on the back wall )<br />
<br />
- OT body pulls<br />
- MT taunts and pulls Venoxis behind the campfire<br />
- Mages / druids CC 3 of the snakes<br />
- Melee &amp; Ranged DPS down 2 of the snakes ( keep 2 CC'd for the remainder of the fight<br />
- Dispell renew anytime Venoxis casts it on himself<br />
- ONLY ranged DPS until Venoxis changes forms<br />
- The MT moves Venoxis around pulling him out of the AOE poison while melee goes in and you burn him down</div></div><hr />

Enjoy~</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Guilds way is slightly different...just so you can think of another way of doing it. Can't remember ever seeing the chain lightening, so this might be a good way if you have the DPS.<br />
<br />
-Pally bubbles up and spits on Venoxis (sp?)<br />
-MT takes Venoxis over to the fountain<br />
-AoE the living poop out of the adds (normally takes about 5-10 seconds (2 or 3 Detruction Locks FTW :D)<br />
-One Rogue goes in to DPS while Tank does his/her job. Everyone else with mild ranged DPS<br />
-At 50% more melee DPS (avoiding the poison cloud ofc - make sure the tank doesn't fall of the cliff lol, this has happened once to us before)<br />
-20% FULL DPS!!!!! NUKE!!!!!!<br />
-Sit back, relax, and enjoy bidding on loot/skinning whatever you want to do :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres a Horde version.<br />
<br />
-MT pulls Venoxis away.<br />
-Druids/Mage/Locks AoE Adds (everything that can AoE should do so even if druids are Resto or feral)<br />
-After adds Shammy cast all manner of mana regen and Druids cast innervate on whomeever needs it<br />
-Meanwhile all healers should mostly be sitting on MT.<br />
-Ranged Dps till he changes form<br />
-Full Dps/nuke till he falls over.</div></div><hr />
