<br />
I have never had to enter my userid when signing on since 2001 and of course dont remember it (<br />
<br />
Now there is no way for me to get any of the SoE help options to work because they all ask for info I can't supply. The userid help asks me for my birth date - which I'm sure I never supplied them. My old ID at station.com is valid but it doesn't like my password (what I have is six characters and it must have 8 now) <br />
<br />
I tried to creat a new accout but it deosnt help any. <br />
<br />
Is there anyway to contact them to get any help? an email address? Phone #? Anything online so far just asks for the info I dont have and it just goes around in circles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the Eqlive forums however, when you try to login, it asks for your Userid and password.<br />
<br />
Try the password you have.  If it works you can click the My account and should be able to change options there.<br />
<br />
If it rejects it then you will have to contact customer service during business hours.</div></div><hr />
