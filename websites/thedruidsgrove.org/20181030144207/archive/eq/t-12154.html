<br />
Any ideas/guesses as to what this progression AA does?<br />
<br />
[Sun Sep 18 20:38:33 2005] Your task 'Emperor Draygun (Raid)' has been updated.<br />
[Sun Sep 18 20:38:39 2005] You sense something very sinister enter you.  It feels warm and slow, purposeful and immense.  You know that you have just gained some sort of curse because of the death of Draygun.  You know that the thing you have just taken possession of is a curse, evil and frightening, but you also know that it might hold a promise of great power.<br />
[Sun Sep 18 20:38:40 2005] You have gained the ability &quot;Curse of Blood&quot; at a cost of 0 ability points.</div></div><hr />

However it could be like don where there's only a handful of raids and once you beat the 5th your done =p.</div></div><hr />

There was another paragraph of text to go with it, more storyline, but still no clue what it does.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">09-19-2005, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Each level of the AA actually HURTS you in the 'progression' raids. First progression raid (if this is progression) you have no AE on at all when zoning in. After winning any of the 5 raids you then gain an AE. If you are 1/5 when zoning into the next progression raid you will get the AE for that zone at level 1 of the AE. When you hit 2/5 you get the second level of the AE etc. Assuming 5/5 opens Dreadspire or is part of the events opening Dreadspire.</div></div><hr />

Got the 2nd one tonite, Affliction of Blood:<br />
[Mon Sep 19 20:06:38 2005] You feel the curse placed upon you growing stronger.  Bloodeye obviously had the same curse and it has latched onto you.  You know that you are closer to death and at the same time closer to ultimate power.  You sense that your strength is being leached away, but you also believe that it might return to you ten fold, though defiled and alien.<br />
[Mon Sep 19 20:06:39 2005] You have improved Affliction of Blood 2 at a cost of 0 ability points.<br />

Thinking each boss's AE hits you harder the higher your curse is. So when we go back to kill Draygun again... I think his AE will pound me harder.<br />
<br />
Like a built in time sink... farm the lower mobs before going to the harder mobs or the lower mobs get harder.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
So far we have Emp, Bloodeye and Mistress Stryha (sp) all which give out the intial aa, and I am assuming the following levels as you beat them.<br />

Since you can get into Dreadspire with 4 groupable tasks why would anyone want to do these events if they get harder after each encounter and have no visible reward other than loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naturer</div><div class="date">10-01-2005, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i IMAGINE that the raid ones unlock dreadspire for raid rather than the group tasks for a group, *a guess*, and the AAs make some area effect detrimental spells do less ... &quot;detriment&quot; to you.  I am also hypothesizing that you may need it for a fight or many in dreadspire, or that  it will protect you from such, as they do in the five raids you get the AAs in. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">10-01-2005, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Consider 5/5 as having all PG trials completed.  If you don't have PG raid trials completed you can't zone into Anguish.  If you don't have 5/5 Blood you can't zone into Demiplane of Blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinnotetiquan</div><div class="date">10-01-2005, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But as you gain more Blood AAs the Blood events AEs get worse correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">10-01-2005, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is correct, so if you have no aspirations as a guild to raid Demiplane of Blood then these are only hurting you.  The AEs themselves are very weak, there is little reason to get too worried about them imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quinnotetiquan</div><div class="date">10-01-2005, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the Demiplane of Blood is basically an intanced version of Dreadspire right?</div></div><hr />
