<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">01-07-2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a bit of info. :) I am sure Exodus is amazing. I am planning on using my 1st 6 pts when I get there. But do NOT underestimate the chardok dizok escape staff it is ALSO amazing. I have epic in main hand,and dizok escape in inventory slot - hot keyed to my list.<br />
<br />
Staff is 1hb,not sure if you said it was 2hb? or 1, it is 1, so it goes well with shield, ooiv, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the plus on the staff. I can switch from epic to staff in less then 1 second being that is hotkeyed. Staff is also 2+ seconds FASTER then succor spell. druid/wiz succor spell is 9 seconds, staff is about 6.8 secs to succor. So, that is a plus. The di'zok staff does take mana to use True--- BUT, If you are OOM, the Di'zok staff (WILL) go off for you. getting your whole group to safety. So, you do not have to save mana staff will go off when oom. And, Staff Also saves a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Exodus is amazing, and refreshes once every 72 min. wouldn't you want a nice dizok escape just in case you gotta evac again within 72 min?? Just a thought. :-) Keep an open mind to everything. <br />
<br />
Dizok staff= Great!!<br />
Exodus= Amazing!<br />
Exodus + Di'zok Staff = 1 Uber Druid! :D<br />
<br />
I am ally to chardok as well. I solo 90% of the rares in there. And have most of the rare lewt there. :-)<br />
before the locked door.<br />
<br />
If you are allied, you can get yourself a staff. (IF) the rares are up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">01-07-2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is another quick information post to give you a little idea of what to expect if you are considering buying the Exodus skill.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple but, for me, I think it is the single most valuable skill that we can buy, and is arguably the best use of 6 points for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
* The evac itself is fast. <br />
<br />
It's not instant; like a cleric's Divine Aura, it takes 1 second to cast. This is fast enough to get out of all conceivable danger, and yet the tiny delay allows you to tap crouch and interrupt the cast if you wish to abort. Interrupting the Exodus doesn't reset the timer, you can still use it whenever you wish afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
* It's a guaranteed evac.<br />
<br />
Taking no mana, you are at last able to use your complete mana pool. No saving mana for evacs, no saving mana for possible fizzles - you have a guaranteed evac ready for whenever you need it, and can run your mana bar bone dry on those last-minute heals that could mean the difference between a close success and an evac situation.<br />
<br />
Users of the Chardok staff may already not save mana for evacs, though the swapping in of a 2hb in place of a 1h weapon and shield under the pressure of a train didn't ever strike me as being the most reliable evac in the world. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
* It drains no party mana.<br />
<br />
Succour/Evacuate of course sap mana from each of your party members; Exodus does not. You arrive at the zone's safespot with the amount of mana with which you evac'd, which can often mean the difference between life and death depending on the zone's 'safe' spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
* It saves a spell slot<br />
<br />
This is the crux of the matter, I think. For just six AA points, you are essentially buying yourself a spell slot. The effect of this really cannot be underestimated.<br />
<br />
I evac very rarely, as I am sure is the case with most by now. However, one still had to mem Succour in the past just in case. Though it is virtually unused, it still has to take up a spell slot as one could never be sure.<br />
<br />
Exodus allows you to completely demem Succour, and gives you a spell slot. I sometimes find myself so accustomed to being tied into my usual number of spell slots that I am sometimes at a slight loss with what best to fit into the new slot! Perhaps Nature's Recovery, if it is made to stack with Regrowth. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, this is a super skill; I would recommend it to everyone that has Class AA points to spend; I hope that this post has been a little use for those thinking about where to spend their points. :)<br />

after you use the Exodus spell/ability, how long until you can use it again? What is the average Recycle/Reuse time on the class-specific abilities? <br />
<br />
It is 72 minutes, which is the same as Dire Charm and Mass Group Buff. <br />
<br />
72 minutes is a fine amount of time - you can go back to memming your old Succour spell if you have evac'd and are going back into danger just for the remaining time before Exodus is ready to use again. <br />
<br />
However, as I said above, the benefit of Exodus comes from realising that you barely ever use Succour, and yet have to keep it memmed all of the time just in case that moment comes up when you need it.<br />
<br />
Plus, if you're evaccing more than once every 72 minutes on a regular basis it might be time to seek a little friendly advice. :)<br />

Exodus, when combined with Mass Group Buff, does not take your guild to the safe spot - I tried just the other day! Perhaps this is a good thing, perhaps not. :)<br />
<br />
Teleports stopped becoming &quot;buffs&quot; after /targetgroup was implemented - if you remember that one night of being able to teleport other groups!<br />
<br />
The Chardok Staff is 1hb? That is very nice indeed! However, the chances of my attaining a Chardok Staff are middling to zero, given that I'm allied to that dungeon - and six points for the convenience of saving an inventory slot, not using mana, and a Divine Aura-style cast aren't too bad, for me at least. :)<br />
<br />
As with all these skills, they're not suited to everyone's tastes - which is probably a good thing, as it encourages a little diversity in a class that was becoming homogenous.<br />
