I will not be on often enough to go straight into heroics (and dont have the cash to buy the crafted gear that would get me there to begin with anyway)<br />
<br />
in TBC, you had the heavy clefthoof set which made a good base for tanking, is there an equivalent set in Lich king?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did notice some of those items are epics though, am really looking at what crafted Blues (read small cost) and quest blues to chase down.  <br />
<br />
I will have a look at home, but hate spending play time researching lol</div></div><hr />

They are lvl 78 rares, crafted by your friendly LW.  They are actually PvP items, but have many of the good tanking stats you will need too.    Cost: ~10 heavy Borean, and an eternal or two.  (Depending which piece)<br />
<br />
You could easily tank entry level heroics in that set once its enchanted.  Keep your eye out for the Trollwoven Shoulders on the AH too!  They can be pricey, but you never know when a LW is going to need cash fast.  They are the best shoulders pre-Naxx-25 atm (better than T7).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">01-20-2009, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're looking for cheap, then most of the quest blues are actually good enough to start tanking heroics. Of course if you're just starting to tank heroics, stick to UK, nexus and COT (nontimed runz) to start with. If you're gonna farm up an item, don't be a cheap ass and get the trollwoven set, it takes like a day to farm up the eternals yourself, i sold extra eternals to pay for the leather i couldn't skin myself. Trollwoven are top tier till you get to naxx, and are maybe top 3 in game so its worth the *same* amount of time to farm up the epics as it is to farm up the blues.</div></div><hr />

now i have a good income (selling Dragonseyes on AH) I have bought both Trollwoven pieces and the nerubhide cloak.  Also lucky enough to have a guildy send me a pair of the chain gang legguards yesterday.  with the new patch i have 29k armour and 25k health without any stam gems or enchants so pretty happy.<br />
<br />
tanked VH heroic last night without a glitch so the patch really helped out.<br />
<br />
thanks for the answers guys, I got on the links you sent at home and printed them out so i can keep an eye out for them cheap on the AH   :wiggle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">01-22-2009, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah the trollwoven set and nerubhide cloak are awesome for a non raider.<br />
<br />
i finally dug my nerubhide cloak out of the bank/mailbox yesterday and finally equipped it !!!<br />
<br />
i slapped a 22 agi chant on the nerubhide and my ice striker's as the mats were quite cheap.<br />
<br />
are they the best chants for cloaks these days or did i miss something ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-22-2009, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, 22agi to cloak is the best tanking and Kitty enchant atm.</div></div><hr />

But I had the crafted epics and blues made for my character and I have no problem with any heroics. Here is my armory;http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Mug%27thol&amp;n=Bloodysewati<br />
<br />
I have approx. 31k health, 31k armor, and 34% dodge, and havent enchanted everything yet. I also have the polar cord which puts me closer to 33k health with about the same dodge.</div></div><hr />
