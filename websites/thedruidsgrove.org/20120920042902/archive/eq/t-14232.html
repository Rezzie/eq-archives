Cold based ATK/AC debuffs<br />
Some solution to SotG/W for raiders who can't use it during certain encounters<br />
Cold based DoTs<br />
AE overwriting Mask line fix<br />
Better curing toolkit<br />
<br />
//<br />
<br />

<br />
Crit cheal<br />
Endurance regen (system need overhaul)<br />
Upgraded bear pet</div></div><hr />

Desperate Renewal is 200, but I don't think it is fair to compare the two.</div></div><hr />

Desperate Renewal is also a single target heal, not a group heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you can add fix group / single steeloak and eagles overwriting.  Also increase dps, reduce heal mana cost.<br />
<br />
Also, for those druids who don't have access to uber items, the druid &quot;quick&quot; heals are anything but quick.  Dropping them from 3.75 seconds to 3 seconds would help them out.  With Spell Haste V item from DoN, this makes the quick heal actually sort of quick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't use Chlorotrope at all. I don't have the mana pool to support its use, not when I can get around the same performance from SI. I'd be interested to see what sort of heal we get with TSS.</div></div><hr />
