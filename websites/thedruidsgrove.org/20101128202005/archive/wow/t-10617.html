Near the end of it, an icon (a red guy) appeared on my screen, next to the right-side action bar.  I thought it was related to something about the SM, but none of my party members had it.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that it had to do with my equipment?  My bracers were broken, from all the trips to the graveyard.</div></div><hr />

As your gear wears down it shows up over there as yellow then red when it is gone, if the whole guy was red you were basically naked, and probably had a monster repair bill.<br />
<br />
Surprised you never noticed it before, came up a lot the first 10 levels or so with me until I got some more durable gear.</div></div><hr />
