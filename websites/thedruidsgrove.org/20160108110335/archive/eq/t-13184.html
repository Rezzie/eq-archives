Couple questions tho..<br />
<br />
I've found 4 locked doors so far.  The first was in the guest chambers, which nimchip was able to help me find the key to (The Restless One &amp; Attlais the Drinker drops)  The second is in the library, after doin the doorman and/?/or functionary task, it opens for you. <br />
   <br />
    The third is behind the 2nd door in the library, when clicked it gives the &quot;you have no idea how to open this&quot; message instead of the &quot;bolted shut from behind&quot;.  My eye spies a staircase leading upwards behind it.  Any ideas how to open this?<br />
<br />
   The fourth locked door I've found was behind Ur-Koraag in the tunnels.  The door gave the &quot;bolted shut from behind&quot;.. inside my eye spied a large room behind the door.  I don't know of any other access to that room, so i'm guessing it's unopenable unless you are in the demiplane.  Any ideas on that one?<br />
<br />
Lastly, in tryin to discover new loots/nameds I had been camping the ballroom/library.  In addition to finding named dancers and some Alex the Ac dood, i've also found 2 of the 3 Dreadspire library tomes.<br />
<br />
Leather-Bound Dreadspire Tome and Strange Dreadspire tome are in my possession, but not the Illedible Dreadspire Tome.. Any ideas if those have any purpose?</div></div><hr />

That area is important only in the instance (Demi Plane). As far as  I know there's no access to it on Dreadspire<br />

<br />
They don't have any practical purpose that i know of.<br />
<br />
Otherwise the rest can only be described by a lot of spoilers and partially related to some quests that you need to do in order to get the demi-plane instance. I would be happy to tell you but these quests are more enjoyable if you do them on your own.</div></div><hr />

the 4th door is empty in the global version but houses hatchet in the instanced version.<br />
 <br />
the 3rd is empty as well all the way to the back (there's 2 spiral stair cases iirc then a big room that's much like hatchets in size/shap) not sure if that serves a purpose in the instanced version for teir 2 bosses.</div></div><hr />
