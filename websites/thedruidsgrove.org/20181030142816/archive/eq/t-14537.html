 The augs weren't being retuned, or adjusted... It was just me accidently setting the HP/Mana/End to 0.  I've restored those stats to the original state, and they'll go out with the next patch.<br />

The stats have vanished or been decreased. It just doesn't update the more artifacts I turn in. I've tried everything, even turning in old artifacts. I'm convinced this has to do with my putting the lodestone in my charm before letting it max out. My lodestone stopped updating at the same time.<br />
<br />
The second link is busted, but that was the griffon tamer charm mentioned. It had 400 hp and dropped off something blue to 75. The serpent charm should be the same.</div></div><hr />

Chances are that it's one of the few bugs in the latest expansion.  The stats you posted are pretty weak and I would expect it to be fixed in the next patch.<br />

mine is at 3 atk, 47ish hp/mana still.... Had all of those handed in except Vergalid, turned in Vergalid and went to 70HP/mana..  working on Icefall griffons atm, guessing that will boost it to 94 or higher because of sunderock grp + raid ones complete<br />
<br />
Completed all shown above for CR, BF, SH GM, BR, TS, SS, VM and IFG.. 6AC, +5 to all stats, + 5 to all resists, +6 atk, + 1 regen + 1 FT, +94HP/Mana/end<br />
<br />
Noted boosts..  IFG, Vergalid, Mesa<br />
So no extra boost from having oblivion's piece.</div></div><hr />

My charm is sitting at 94hp/mana and 5 to stats/resists now with 1 regen and FT 6ac and 6atk and I haven't noticed any rhyme or reason to why the charm updates but I have a feeling it involves collecting all the pieces from a certain zone again not certain but it would make sense</div></div><hr />

Has any raided Oblivion yet? If so can you tell me how many clones and how often he spawns them. I tried with a beefy group and we got our heads handed to us. Also is Magmaraug a raid or groupable mob?<br />

Has anyone gotten any drops out of DW and ID'd them yet?</div></div><hr />
