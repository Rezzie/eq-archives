I'm in dire need of an easy-to-use, yet insanely efficient Healing Addon.  Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
What are your favorites?</div></div><hr />

When healing using HOT's I have all of my heals set up in mouseover cast macros.  Then I use Grid and map my macros to key strokes like 1=LifeBloom, 2 = Rejevenation, 3=Regrowth and I just watch the buttons and hover my mouse over the grid frames.  I also use DOTimer for keeping track of when my HOTs will expire.  I find its the best way to keep track of most importantly the tanks when I'm healing them so I can keep my rolling lifebloom going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no first hand experience with either product, but I keep an eye out as I assume I may have to become some sort of raid healer someday.</div></div><hr />

I've been healing  on my shaman mainly, so I wouldn't really be able to tell you how it goes for druid healing since my druid is still feral :)</div></div><hr />

and a couple simple macros.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it has a display showing all the members of your group (even raid size) and can be configured along a ton of lines. decurse, poison, range, health deficit, class, group, etc. and it is all run by clicking on the names, with each mouse button being a specific spell, for in-combat and/or out-of. and you can save the different setups for preferred use (i.e. battleground vs. raid). all of this means it can be a bit heavy on the setup side of things, but it comes pre-disposed toward whatever class you are playing so if you don't have time/desire you don't have to fiddle.<br />
<br />
oh and it cooperates with other users, so you can see incoming heals and rezs from the other healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Itemrack and Outfitter are the two I'm looking at (unless someone has a better suggestion)<br />
<br />
Now that I'm building like 6 different gear sets.....I'm getting sick of having to equip everything by clicking on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That, Outfitter and Itemrack are the ones most people use. Just find out what fits you best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">12-19-2007, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Healbot (esp on my Holy priest) and ItemRack. Both work well once setup is customized. I'm not a computer expert, and it took me a little fiddling around to get them working the way I want them, but now I couldn't imagine playing without them. Healbot is especially useful if your guild's other healers have it downloaded- they don't even have to use it, just have it installed. It automatically shows if you will overheal based on current incoming heals, assuming your current cast lands for an average (non-crit) value, so you can just cancel a heal before it lands.</div></div><hr />
