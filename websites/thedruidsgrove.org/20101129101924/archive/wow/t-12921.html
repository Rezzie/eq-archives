I ended up going 10/0/51 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0VGZZf0IubuxVuVzst) and wow.<br />
 <br />
Gift of the Earthmother is crazy.  GCD on hots is amazingly quick.  <br />
 <br />
I did get low on mana a few times (think they increased the cost of spells), but overall I was impressed.<br />
 <br />
Used Nourish a few times, that plus a super quick LB on party members taking the most damage brings them up pretty quickly.  <br />
 <br />
Having a rez is awesome, and being able to root / cc indoor kicks arse.  <br />
 <br />
What does everyone else think?</div></div><hr />

Uh not to be a pain in the :moon:  but Nourish is a lvl 80 spell how did you use it in game already, or are u talking about Beta?<br />
<br />
Wild Growth is a pretty nice spell, it is basically our CoH and it is a smart heal also which is cool.   For my first spec after patch I am currently 0/0/61~if blizz's site would stay up for more than 10 min I would link it ~ not sure if it will stay that way I am &quot;testing&quot; it out to see if I need to make changes!  Healed a 1hr 10min full clear ZA last night and really had no mana issues at all.<br />
<br />
I am glad they took out the speed reduction debuff to Tree form that was annoying.</div></div><hr />

Lol oops. I meant Wild Growth. :bonk: <br />

Yeah, that's nice. Lots of good 'fixes' to tree healing.<br />
 <br />
I'm currently 10/0/51 (for Genesis and Moonglow): http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0VGZZf0IubuxVuVzst<br />
 <br />
Was thinking of going with 5/0/56 (Dropping Moonglow and picking up Living Seed / filling out Replenish): http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0VZZf0IubuxVuVIst<br />
 <br />
What are your thoughs on Living Seed? And Replenish 3/3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Auroc</div><div class="date">10-21-2008, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to run a wws to see how good Replenish is really... as for Living seed, I do see it proc a lot but again i think a wws would be better info on that.  We may be running MH tonight for old times sake I will make sure to have one running and see what I come up with. I am not a master theorycrafter and my Druid has just recently become my main again so my gear isn't uber or anything.</div></div><hr />

Wild Growth for a 5-man is simply dreamy.<br />
<br />
No mana issues for the Hyjal run, but I did have mana issues for the ZA run.  We had a relatively new group and only a couple of us had actually experienced Hex Lord before.  Regardless, I still think mana will be a problem for future content.<br />
<br />
From levels 71-75 I think I'll put my points into my balance tree.  I'll work on getting Living Seed for future raiding.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, my balance cast times are so slow that I really can't stand it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and an interesting site that data mines the armory for the &quot;most popular&quot; talent builds.....<br />
<br />
http://www.talentchic.com/Druid<br />
<br />
NOTE: Looking at the Feral builds,  &quot;most popular&quot; =\= &quot;best&quot; or even &quot;ok&quot;.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Yeah, I really like it for healing too.  I'm not sure about the mana issues, I can't think of any way to be more mana efficient without going down to dreamstate.  I think my build at 80 will be 36/0/35.  Not sure tho.<br />
 <br />
I put those 2 points into Nature's magesty thinking it would help with dailies, but without Starlight Wrath, everything is waay too slow.  I've just been spamming &quot;tree healbot lf dps for dailies&quot; and having decent luck finding a warrior or something to stick along with that just aoe's everything down.  <br />
 <br />
For pure healing those 2 points would probably be better in living seed or replenish /shrug.</div></div><hr />

Heh, started to seriously look at resto last night and came up with exactly the same build you did.  Glad to hear it works well.<br />
<br />
I never used to have mana problems before the patch, will I have problems now using the same gear?  Should I switch to some higher regen items?</div></div><hr />

Our main resto druid who NEVER went OOM is having a hard time adjusting and at the end of fights now is usually at the bottom of her mana pool.  <br />
<br />
Now, I suppose if you're at the end of a fight and everyone you were supposed to heal is alive and you're oom it's ok...but...<br />
<br />
I dunno if she reads here, but if she does *hugs* to Elly.</div></div><hr />

Is it worth it for me to swap some pieces out from my bank and give up ~ 100 sp for ~ 100 mp5 ooc?  I haven't spec'd resto, that's in feral spec.</div></div><hr />
