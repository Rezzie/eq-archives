Who has picked theirs up so far?<br />
<br />
I got mine Wednesday evening, I know Relevart ( also posts here ) has his and is 70 already ( good pvp'ing against you again dude =D )<br />
<br />
It is the Ring of Blood quest line in Nagrand where you have to battle 6 different bosses.<br />
<br />
1st is a Clefthoof - nothing really rough about this guy, was able to duo him with a priest healing me.<br />
<br />
2nd - 2 mobs 65 elites ( I think ), again a very straight forward tank and spank fight.  Again, able to duo these guys, but from here out we asked for help.<br />
<br />
3rd - Giant - Does a knock back and a &quot;pierce&quot; which stacks up to 5 doing damage over time.  It's kinda nasty, but had the priest heal me as I got 4 on me and it was a very straight forward fight.<br />
<br />
4 - Void walker - a aggro reducing knockback, and shadow damage.  Still a pretty straight forward fight.<br />
<br />
5 - Warrior - I've seen the model vary a few times but he always has the same moves, random charge and mortal strike.  Oh, and he hits kind of hard too.  This was the hardest IMO.<br />
<br />
6 - Shaman - The Ogre guy standing next to the quest giver.  He drops totems, heals and frost shocks.  After you down him he'll self rez and you get to do it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 of us with the quest got together and did it, we enjoyed it, loved the rewards (plus a nice chunk of cash and exp) too. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">01-28-2007, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got mine last weekend at 65 and been loving it.  Got to 70 Friday night (wee!) and haven't yet seen an upgrade in regular questing, but there is a quest chain out of the Shadownmoon instance that had us druids drooling when it was linked in guild, will be searching that chain out asap.<br />
<br />
Ring of Blood is a very fun quest chain and I've done it several times now with various groups almost always when doing it we've been there while other groups were waiting on it as well and it goes very quickly when 15 people are attacking and healing each other to speed everyone through it.</div></div><hr />

On my server, it was just single groups, but, then again, that's because when I was in Nagrand... only 20 other people were.<br />
<br />
I got mine early this week/last weekend as well. And yeah, no upgrades for it yet. It's so awesome.</div></div><hr />

Can someone post the stats to both as I have been grinding rep there to get it...seems easier to do the quest chain than to grind rep:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
tanked all the Ring of Blood for a guild grp last week, never choose the reward for it - when i logged in the next day it told me the quest was failed !<br />
<br />
so managed to get into a grp last nite and complete it :)<br />
<br />
nice staff although i'd like one with a chunk of armour for tanking like Eartrhwarden.<br />
<br />
i'm still using the blue 250 Ar mace from DM Trib (name totally escapes me at this moment!) and i have a unbound Warden Staff which i dont know wot to do with ! lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ghortje</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i suggest you use the staff of beasts for tanking too.<br />
due to the high sta and agi it is better then the 250AC you use for tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheers i'll take a better look at it tonite. was the last thing i did online last nite so not even tried equipping it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woo!  Got mine Sunday night.  Tanked the entire thing at 66, with a 66 warlock, 66 ret pally healing, 68 moonkin dps / healing and 70 hunter.  Kind of an odd group.  Dinged 67 right when I completed the final boss (shaman guy).  <br />
<br />
The warrior boss that hits for 3k+ mortal strikes wiped us a good 5 times before we got it down.  Really would have been easier with a healer speccd for healing to heal through the MS 50% heal reduction and spike damage.  He was by far the hardest.<br />
<br />
So I'm wondering if I should throw a +35agi on my Staff of Beasts (have the mats), or wait until I hit 70, cause I assume that there is a better druid staff out there at 70.  Has anyone gotten a better staff, or does anyone recommend waiting to enchant mine?  The staves that were listed in this thread all seem pretty difficult to get...<br />
<br />
I've got a Braxxis Staff of Slumber for tanking (550 armor), which puts my total AC really high, though it has no stam, which kinda hurts.  I use it on bosses that do a lot of melee / physical damage, though almost 95% of the time, I end up using the Staff of Beasts for the stam.  <br />
<br />
*edit*  The mace you have Khel is the Unyielding Maul.   And I'd recommend putting the Warden Staff up on the AH for like 150 - 200 gold.  It's still godly for young ferals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ring of Blood is a very fun quest chain and I've done it several times now with various groups almost always when doing it we've been there while other groups were waiting on it as well and it goes very quickly when 15 people are attacking and healing each other to speed everyone through it.<br />
<br />
I actually did this quest chain with some guildies again last night, and a group of about 10 horde came along, saw where we were in the chain (second boss - the two lv 65 elites), and proceeded to help us kill them, then waited while we did the last 4.  We decided to stick around and help them as well.  <br />
<br />
At the end, everyone /bowed, /thanked, and went on their way.  Kind of cool cooperation to get a quest line done.  After that, though, my guildies and I got back into the world pvp that was going on, and ended up fighting some of the same horde that we had just fought alongside at the ring of blood.  Good times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">02-20-2007, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you love the AC, you may want to check your AH for Braxxis' Staff of Slumber, a level 64 BoE world drop blue that has 550 AC and decent FAP on it.  It has no stamina or agility, so it's not the perfect tank weapon, but I use it most of the time when tanking.<br />
<br />
Between that and the Staff of Beasts, I'm good until I get Earthwarden or the octopus staff from Karazahn.</div></div><hr />

This staff drops fairly often in Botanica and is a nice upgrade to the Beast staff..I put a 35agi on it and it should keep me occupied till I get the one from Kharazan.</div></div><hr />

yeah first thing i did last nite was check it out !<br />
<br />
its sad to be old and slow you cant rememeber your main tanking weapon for the last year !<br />
<br />
not sure the Warden will get that much now in BC? but i dont think i need it. so some more gold towards epix mount would be nice !<br />

i'll keep and eye on AH for the Slumber one.....</div></div><hr />

Don't know about the one from Shadowmoon, but it appears to be inferior as well. Better off taking the dagger there too. Sold the Fleshling for 10 gold...it was useless!!!<br />
