<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-28-2007, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say the biggest druid-specific change has been the addition of the spell Skin of the Reptile.    It is a short duration targetted buff that adds a &quot;defensive proc&quot;--a proc that has a chance of firing every time a mob swings at that player.  On average the proc fires about once (per mob) every six seconds.  The proc heals the player for 600 with all hate going to that player instead of the druid.<br />
<br />
We also got Moonshadow, a group heal (and its upgrade, Lunarlight).  It's crippled by an 18 sec recast time, but it's still a significant improvement for times when a druid needs to heal against AE damage.<br />
<br />
Our damage output is still on the weak side, though there have been a couple relatively recent improvements in this area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raynee</div><div class="date">09-29-2007, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also with the new expansions we got TL's instead of just single and group ports, but only so far for tss and tbs zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">10-01-2007, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I might also add there is mastery of the past for all spells up to lvl 70 do not fizzle so that makes serpents vine, skin reptilemoonshadow and ancient chloroborn first runners in my book and I pop out chlorotrope on raids also. We also got an AA snare that works well in icefall and is so so in Atiki but lands almost 100% on lord efreeti's and harder to land on casters.<br />
 <br />
There is symbol quest I would recommend if you are going to solo boost up your hps. TBS hand aug quest is super nice exp and is one of the best group augs in the game if not the best (and can be solo'ed/duo'ed)</div></div><hr />

I'm still just astonished by how much has changed and how some things are so much the same. I'm still trying to figure out where people are actually levelling and playing in the 70-75 range, there's so many options I can't decide where to look first. Thank goodness TDG is still around! :D</div></div><hr />
