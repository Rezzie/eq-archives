  Been inactive for quite a while and I was hoping for some suggestions, I am really limited to DoN's and possibly some of the DoD quests. My guild is a family type. Just want an improvement over all, I seem to heal quite a bit in groups. Thanks in advance!<br />

Thrice-Laced Wristguard<br />
Blood-Soaked Bracer<br />
Gilded Drakeguard<br />
<br />
go to mpg and get:<br />
Soul-Imbued Ring - rots quite a bit (replace thunderous spirits)<br />
<br />
<br />
do ALL DoD spell missions.  they drop good loot and should provide you with some decent gear.  go here to preview what loots each mission drops sammana.net (http://samanna.net/gen.info/prog.dod.shtml)<br />
<br />
<br />
keep your flowing thought gear until you max it (15).  then start to replace wanderer's wrist , solstice earring.</div></div><hr />

The minimum stats of the charm are 100ish with stats and resists and the Slipgear Gem is 50 hp/mana with stats.  The charm is luck of the draw with drops and named, the augment is 100% doable solo just buy some IVU potions and download the current maps.<br />
 <br />
I'm too lazy to find the link, just look at my charm slot for the name of the charm.</div></div><hr />

You would be suprised what you can do here.  The creator mission is really simple and the mobs aren't that tough.  With a slower and a DoN geared tank you could probably handle these missions although you may not blow through them.  Either way its 40ish crystals which overtime add up to some nice gear or augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">01-12-2006, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For sure, DoDH missions, DoN for augments, and attunable gear from OoW/DoDH would round you out nicely. You'll find that you run into belts that are better statwise than Silverine. One way to fix this loss of focus effects is to camp the IHV augment in Stillmoon that drops from Stonewing, in the first 'snowy' part of the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is ai IHV aug which drops in Stillmoon Temple, just inside the first door in the room on the right iirc.<br />
<br />
Snowy? Not sure what she was suggesting here, as the only snow I know of is in The Ascent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ANYWAY. The first room of the whiteish area is where Mark of Focused Life drops.</div></div><hr />
