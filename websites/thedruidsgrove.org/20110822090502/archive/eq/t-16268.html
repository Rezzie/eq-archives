<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kadwen</div><div class="date">09-19-2007, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking of returning to EQ after a 6 month break. I used to 2 box a beastlord but before leaving I became more interested in his casting abilities more so than his overall play style. Thus I have decided to try out his parent priest class, the shaman. I'm all about playing fair to properly learn the shaman class, but I think I just want to fly right by the levels. I've played most classes 1-70 (one 73) but this time around I think it's ok to spoil myself a little. I have a certain way of pling my toons and friends toons (i do not do this for money) but I wanted to know what you guys do, if you do, when helping out lower level characters. I do not wish to insinuate that druids are only good for Pling, any class can, but I will admit my character's talents are very beneficial for a personal goal.<br />
<br />
Thoughts about how to pl?</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the one thing I noticed that wasn't covered much on that thread due to its age is Barkspur/Fernspur.  As soon as your character is high enough level for barkspur to land, use it as often as possible (and switch to Fernspur when that will land).</div></div><hr />
