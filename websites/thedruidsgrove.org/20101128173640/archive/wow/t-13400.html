<br />
Anyone else heard this and/or seen anything mentioned by Blizz ?<br />
<br />
Would be wonderful for me as a non raider to be able to potentially get some EoV items :wiggle: <br />
<br />
i'm currently sitting on a stack of 194 badges from running heroics.<br />
<br />
they are not going to be used to improve my oomkin build as there is simply nothing whatsoever to get that's worth it. i've got the chest and gloves and given my offhand and my trinkets i cannot justify using 65 or 80 of them on badge rewards.<br />
<br />
compared to the items you could get from badges in BC - esp from the Smith person on that place where everyone went for Shattered Sun dailys - the items available in Wrath are so poor :(<br />
<br />
Until i heard this rumour last night i was planning to use all my badges for resto gear for dual spec but now i will be waiting with baited breath !!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were rumors of Heroism to Valor conversions pre-3.1 but Blizzard nixxed that plan out of fear of TBC like gearing.  (i.e. folks just farming content way below their skill/gear and using the badges to buy iLvl items way beyond their current content)<br />
<br />
For Example:  Our guild had a raid each week to clear Kara, but you had to be in T5 gear, so we could clear in &lt;3 hours.  (Kara was T4 Content) And then the badges were used to purchase T6 equivalent gear.</div></div><hr />

They're VERY quick raids. Vault shuold take approximately 25 minutes if your group is taking its' time before boss pulls (and not wiping).<br />
OS25 is like a 45 minute raid, tops, if your group has the slightest idea if what they're doing. (No drakes, of course). OS25 also give you the oppurtunity to roll on the [Satchel of Spoils] which gives you 6 (i think) Emblems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sachel = x5 Emblems + pile of gold<br />
<br />
The big problem with VoA, is there are no groups that just want Arch, so everyone wants to wipe on Emalon over and over.  I have been able to get him down in several PUGs now, but only after an hour of wiping and kicking stupid DPS/OTs, and then recruiting more.<br />
<br />
Note:  PUG your way into VoA and OS early in the week.  This gives you the largest talent pool to work with.  E.I. the good players clear it early and are saved, the donkeys keep coming back for more and more all week long until a team is good enough to drag them through!<br />
<br />
The ironic part is no OS pugs ever seem to want to try OS+1.  But everyone want to do Emalon, which in my opinion is far more difficult.  Both are easy with folks who understand personal responsibility, but those folks are tough to fish out of the PUG pool.</div></div><hr />

nope someone was saying Heroism to Valour was being mentioned for a future patch.<br />

the thought of trying to find and do a PUG 25 man raid is /shudder.<br />
<br />
its down to time for me, i have to organise my wow time an cant sit around waiting to find a PUG 25 man, let alone spend time wiping then time trying to find replacements for poor players etc<br />
<br />
last night i had a nice long amount of time to play due to the mother in law visiting and helping my wife out with baby boy.<br />
<br />
so with a few people online that I know well we got 3 quick heroics in early evening - blitzed AN (daily heroic in just under 20 mins!!) then a timed CoS (lost the mount roll again) followed by HoL.<br />
<br />
then a quick break to help get some food done. then back with a couple different people I know to do a fast UK and Drak.<br />
<br />
that does not happen very often. and i do not rememeber seeing anyone asking for PUG raids. maybe the tend to happen later at night after i've logged.<br />
<br />
its just a shame that i feel i'm playing now for zero benefit to myself....no oomkin upgrades from heroics/badges. i will have to await for new shiny crafted items from Uldaur recipes or buy ilvl 219/226 from the AH when they appear....usually at 4k plus an item.<br />
<br />
sorta makes me think why continue playing.</div></div><hr />

/shudder<br />
<br />
i do not have the patience to level more chars. i simply cannot go through all the levelling in the same places / same quests etc its just not exciting enough even though i know it would be different due to as different class.<br />
<br />
hence my only other high level is a lvl 58 mage who has not moved a level in well over a yr......given i've played since Day 1 of Wow this is prbably quite shocking to most of u :elfbiggri <br />
<br />
I tried it with the mage and it took a long time to get to about 50. then i left it again for a long time before coming back to him for a bit to get to 58.  then the thought of /yawn Outlands again made me stop.<br />
<br />
plus not being in a big guild etc means more solo play whereas when i levelled originally there were a few of us and ofc the game was new to everyone.<br />
<br />
my only possible option is a DK i guess but even that starting at 55 means all of outland.<br />
<br />
what i really need is the chance to start from nothing less than lvl 70 and only have to redo Northrend.  although then i would have the difficult choice of class ! i'd actually like to get the mage to 80 but cant be bothered with the thought of 60-70.</div></div><hr />

IF you can get a guild that needs  you to fill a 25m and can down all the bosses in under 4 hours, you could always do that one night a week</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vault25, OS25, and hell, even Naxx25 are ALL very easily PUG-able. Hell, the first time i ran through Vault25 and Naxx25 were with a PUG. I had to shout all over my guild's forum to get an OS25 group going. Since we've gotten all the gear we need from OS25, we've moved on, so if i want easy badges, i start up an OS25 group myself.<br />
Getting an OS25 group up and running should take about 10 MAYBE 15 minutes. 2 tanks, 4 decent healers (maybe 5 to be safe), and the rest dps.<br />
The trick to burning down OS with a quickness: go counter clockwise. One the first drake, everyone but one tank and one healer go through the portal and down the add. On the second and third drake, everyone ignore the portals and just burn the drake. Watch a video on Sarth. A video is worth 10,000 words... lol... and &lt;bang&gt; free lewts, and a shot at t7.5 gloves! There's also a wicked set of Boomkin shoulders if i remember correctly.<br />
I've actually gotten a little bit away from raiding with my guild &lt;gasp&gt;. i've done it by pugging both heroics and raids. my dps is solid, i posess at least a little intelligence (or so they think), and being a druid that's not stuck on tanking or healing, we can really be the difference between whether or not we wipe with a well timed Rebirth or Innervate. Raiders remember people like that, and when the time comes that they're short a person or 2, you'll get a tell and most likely a raid invite.</div></div><hr />
