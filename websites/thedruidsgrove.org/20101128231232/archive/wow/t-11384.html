any thoughts on ToL?</div></div><hr />

But then I'm feral and only 40-ish. So ToL is a natural step for a healing druid IMO.<br />

And I guess that's Blizz' intentions with implementing this form as well.</div></div><hr />

It's made HoT's viable, mana efficient spells and allows us to run instances short handed. Even better than that is that it's upset a load priests as they now think we are better healers (which ofc we are^^). Infact I know a fair number who have re rolled a druid just to get ToL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
like i've been telling everyone, the more important talents we've gained in resto are empowered rejuv and empowered ht. those two talents alone will boost your healing by a hefty margin.<br />
<br />
being in caster form, u can decurse, ht heal (which is actually more efficient), and cast hots. why limit yourself to only hots? it's silly, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">12-14-2006, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found the mana savings of ToL is pretty good. In most instances healing isn't a problem between ToL and Emp Rejuv. I rarely use Regrowth unless it's in conjunction with Nature's Swiftness. I'd like to see Swiftmend cooldown timer shortened while in tree form but oh well.<br />
<br />
Although I have no numbers to back it up I'm inclined to agree with Bahroo that HT is more mana efficient than either of our two HoT's. I don't know how it works with all the modifiers we get from talents but the base numbers always looks like HT is better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, in Moonkin you can use all of your balance spells (to my better knowledge--I never spec'd it). In Bear, you can use all of your bear skills. In Cat, you can use all of your cat skills. But in Tree, you can only use some of your healing spells, not all.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. My guess is that this was Blizz's intentions; provide a very specialised healer-boost for raids. But I think that in order to make that viable, ToL should also have the ability to Abolish Poison and decurse, since these make an integral part of the druid's role in raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'm curious about is the aggro in tree form. If you're only using Regroth and Rejuv... you obviously can't always just spam Rejuv, and have to hit Regrowth sometimes for that big heal. If you're primarily using Regrowth then, wouldn't that get a lot of aggro? I have never known the exacts, but I've always heard Regroth &gt; Healing Touch, as far as aggro goes.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how bad the aggro is? Or do you guys manage to keep up with a lot of rejuvs and few regrowths?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In tree form in an instance run like BRD or Strat I can usually stick with Rejuv's. I rejuv early in a fight and just keep it up. For the big heal I usually just Swiftmend the Rejuv then quickly cast Rejuv. I don't have much aggro but it really depends on the tank. If we're fighting 2 or more mobs and the tank doesn't know how to watch out and do a bit of damage to all the mobs I'll pull aggro on the first heal I cast regardless of what it is.<br />
<br />
I will use Regrowth as rarely as possible cause it's such a mana hog. For the times that Swiftmend isn't up I use the Nature's Swiftness + Regrowth combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, ToL seems to lack diversity.  Unlike its counterpart froms (bear, cat) you don't need to be in the form to be your most effective at healing.  Having one per raid?  Sure.  Requiring it?   Not a chance.  It would actually hurt your raid.<br />
<br />
Not to mention in PvP, ToL is a big friggin target.  It's like running around with a 'Kick me!' sign.  And not just because you're a druid.  You'd have to shift out of it to do anything offensive. <br />
<br />
Anyway, to each his own.  I find that it lacks the diversity of the other forms because it is focused on healing but restricted to HoT's.  Give me HT any day.  A rejuv or regrowth is nice, but a HT is solid and dependable. Much less guesswork about timing tics and all that jazz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've actually noticed that lately I don't pull PvP aggro at all.  I don't know why, its really strange.  Its like people see a giant tree with a name over it, and think its just one of those Balance summoned Tree's.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my view of Trees is that they don't have enough to do.<br />
<br />
If you spec tree, its like playing a priest in EQ or something.<br />
<br />
1....1.....1....1....1....1...1.2....1...1...1..1.  ...1....1...1<br />
<br />
It needs another ability or something to make it interesting.  Personally I'd go for also being able to cast Wrath, Thorns, and Remove Poison.  Those all sound like things a druid so in tune with nature they transformed into a tree would be able to do.<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less about MotW, since it lasts an hour.<br />
<br />
I know the common complaint about allowing more spells is that Moonkins don't get additional spells, and here is my counter argument, take it as you will.<br />
<br />
In WoW there are 3 primary class archetypes (various spec's shift to different amounts in different archetypes, but here is the main one).  Support, Tank, and DPS.  Support is your standard healer and Decurse.  If you limited a Paladin to Cloth, and took away the Ret Tree, you'd be left with a 100% support class.  Tank is pretty obvious. We're talking Prot/Ret Paladins, Feral Druids (mainly bears), and Prot Warriors.<br />
<br />
DPS, whether melee (Kitty druids, hunters, rogues etc.) or casters (warlocks, moonkins, mages, etc) all pretty much fill the same role.  This ignore's the &quot;base damage&quot; and only accounts for damage done above the level of a standard Prot warrior.<br />
<br />
Again, most classes/spec's are 80% one, 20% other.<br />
<br />
In a Druids forms, the classes become 100% one, 0% other.  A Moonkin becomes 100% DPS oriented, 0% support when in Moonkin. A Bear becomes like 10%DPS, 90% Tank, and a Cat becomes 100% DPS.<br />
<br />
Tree of Life on the other hand makes the Druid have the same level of Support at the cost of their DPS ability.  They exchange some support items (buffs, HT, remove poison/curse) for additional healing, and then lose their DPS.  And then they get snared too.<br />
<br />
<br />
I play a druid because I enjoy a more secondary healer role.  I have a Mage if I want to nuke things, and I suck at being a tank (I believe the exact words were &quot;can we never have you MT for us again?&quot; And I was the guild leader :shuffle: ) And melee bores me to death.</div></div><hr />

 Life Bloom seems like it will be a very cool spell. Tired of having my HoT's purged away by them dirty Shaman. This spell could be a real life saver.....I hope</div></div><hr />

The initial heal spike of Regrowth will aggro!  So I like to throw a Regrowth on the tank just before he charges in.</div></div><hr />

(And yes I'll try to search first next time ;)  )<br />

Lumbergh, why waste so much mana on a regrowth before the tank pulls/charges in when a rejuv would be adequate? About the time the rejuv runs out, the tank has good enough aggro for a regrowth or healing touch/rejuv combo.Agreed if you drop a regrowth before he takes damage then the big heal before the HoT is wasted.</div></div><hr />
