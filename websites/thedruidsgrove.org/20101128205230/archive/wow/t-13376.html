I wish the staff was for bear but looks like it's for cat, no armor... for bear. I forget the name of it.<br />

Thanks<br />

Armor on weapons neck/rings ( i forget if anything else) DOES NOT multiply like the rest of our gear does while in bear form. ( someone correct me if i am wrong)</div></div><hr />

Plus DKs and hunters might be able to use same weapon.<br />
<br />
And talon is right, weapon armor doesn't multiply anymore, so there is no real reason to put armor on a weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
indeed, 1 weapon for both is now viable although the issue i have there is you may wish to use a different enchant for different specs like cat or bear.<br />

i think what Wind means is that there is no armour on the weapon he is talking about leading him to believe its not a bear weapon, rather than enchanting it with armour ?</div></div><hr />

Mongoose is still a very viable enchant for both bear and kitty.  There are better pure bear or pure cat enchants, but it is a significant boost to both builds.</div></div><hr />

What would be a pure bear enchant?<br />
Moongoose is best IMO</div></div><hr />

This staff is odd, it has huge AP in cat/bear and also pure AP, crit, stats...<br />
<br />
I'll try to remember to write the name and stats of this staff down.</div></div><hr />

Berserking (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59621) is by and large the best for pure kitty.  Mongoose is the best hybrid (both kitty &amp; bear).</div></div><hr />

+110 AP a little lower, but also very nice for a straight stat.</div></div><hr />
