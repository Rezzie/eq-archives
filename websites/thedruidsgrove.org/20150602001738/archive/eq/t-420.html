Only difference is the price.  There are usually less GM tailors that worship Karana, therefore the price will be on average a bit more.<br />

The stuff for Karana druids is called &quot;Stormreaper Boned xxx&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They put them into the game and then decided it wasn't a good idea to make more like that so the halflings kinda loose out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are really twinking/PLing the hell out of him or her, make it Human.  In the end stats and stuff really don't matter.  Humans are rare, so a little more cool.</div></div><hr />

Halflings also get sneak (use any vendor, bank and do lots of quests without endless hours of faction work) and the best starting stats for any druid race.  Wood elves have sexier models.</div></div><hr />

If I had known back when I started that half-elves don't get a cultural armor, I would have made a wood elf.  If you're not into tradeskills, though, there's nothing wrong with half-elf.<br />
<br />
I also reccommend Tunare if you like quests; there are some fairly nice, simple ones out there.<br />
<br />
I suggest that, overall, you play a race you like.  I really think fun's more important than the most l33t skills or items  ;)</div></div><hr />

Just make sure to buy yourself a Crown of Tranix until you can get some UV going on because vision sucks !<br />

I'd sink points into STA first, then WIS.  There are just too many items out there to increase your WIS now.  If I had the chance to re-roll that's how I would do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glarnor</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stat-wise and innate skill wise, Halfling is the winner. He has the best stats, sneak and hide, two skills druids don't get and sneak is a very powerful skill as it can let you shop and do quests you normally couldn't. <br />
<br />
As for cultural armor, Tunarean Soldier armor can be worn by all druids who worships Tunare and Stormreaper Boned armor can be worn by all druids who worships Karana. However, only Wood Elf Tailors can make the Tunare only armor and only Halfling Tailors can make the pieces.<br />
<br />
Half-elves has the worst stats, and no skills as far as I can remember. (I'm sure half-elves will correct me if I'm wrong. *grin*)<br />
<br />
Wood elves have hide and forage, but you gain forage as a skill. Stats are comparative to both Haflings and Humans, Wood Elves are in between.<br />
<br />
Humans are pretty much the... basis race. No innate abilities, they have cultural, but it's smithing-related, no infravision, which can be a bit of a pain if you can't turn your gamma up, I gather. They have more str and sta than Wood Elves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said there's the question of what your goals are. if you're starting fresh and you don't care about looks, but just want the most powerful race, go Halfling. Other than that, the differences are so small that by the time you hit 50-60, your wis will be maxed anyway, so you're really choosing for looks.<br />
<br />
Now, if you're aiming at a high-end raiding druid, and you have the gear and the cash to support it. I'd say go Human or Halfling and dump as many points as you can in STA, because STA has traditionally been the hardest stat to max for druids.<br />
<br />
ADDED:<br />
Humans and Half-elves can choose between Tunare and Karana. There are a couple of Tunare only and Karana only items in the game, but the consencus is that the Tunare only items are far better than the Karana only item(s?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gamilenka</div><div class="date">06-20-2003, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Halflings get hide.  Hide is extremely useful when soloing.  It's capped at 50, but hey it's not like it takes mana.<br />
<br />
The only real drawbacks of being halfling are: you are short, which just sucks most of the time.  Low cha...if you plan on charm soloing, don't be a halfling.<br />
<br />
Other than those, halflings are really the overall best race playwise.  If you just care about looks, then again you don't want to be a halfling.</div></div><hr />
