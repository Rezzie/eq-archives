Our goal is to get people grouping earlier, and provide them enough of a bonus where they do not feel that they are losing ground during the learning process. We feel we can do this by doubling the grouping experience bonus and by scaling it up based on the size of the group. Currently, the bonus is an additional 2% experience per group member, not counting the first one, leading to a maximum bonus of 10%. Following the next patch, the bonus will be as follows:<br />
<br />
2 person group - 2% total bonus. <br />
3 person group - 6% total bonus. <br />
4 person group - 10% total bonus. <br />
5 person group - 14% total bonus. <br />
6 person group - 20% total bonus.</div></div><hr />
