One look I particular like for druid weaponary is the Wand of Stone Mastery (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=27864) . If I recall correctly, this lil guy has the 'tree branch' look with a glowy purple tip ( if this is incorrect, please insert the name of an item that does look like the description above ). Point is, my druid will never see a raid - ever - even the 3 group BiC raid where this drops. Does anyone know of another weapon with this graphic I may be able to get for her? Particularly I was thinking the Rod of Intensity (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26561)  - does this look like that guy and if so, anyone know spawn point for said mob that drops it?<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Prolly more like a Wand than a tree branch.  The two tree branches you can get are the Druid epic 1.5 and the 2hb from Rallos Zek in time (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24793), but yea it requires raids to get both of those.  But for the purple wands, yea those two would be easiest for you to get that i know of if you want that particular look.  To be honest im already sick of seeing purple wands from GoD hehe, there are quite a few of them throughout all the zones in GoD, for melees and casters.</div></div><hr />

TBH, I see very few of the purple's on my server, and to me, the 'squiggly' look is how it should be. I described it as tree branch only because most of the wands in game have the pencil look to 'em, hehe. I would go after her epic 1.5, but tbh, the druid is techincally my finacee's ( though she has not played since lvl 35... ) and she promises to do something bad to me if I get the epic without her.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Btw, this is her (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1058331) . ;) Quite proud of her for a non-raiding / LDoN toon, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Best way I can describe the Wand of Farsight is a pencil look, where you are holding the pencil at the eraser end, and the sharpened pointy end is white. Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I'm sure the barindu drop you linked will have the purple particle effects.  GoD weapon graphic varitity is about as good as the mob/zone graphic varitity.  Some of them have have purple fuzz at just the top (pointy tipped) while some have fuzz at the top and the bottom (blunt tipped.)</div></div><hr />
