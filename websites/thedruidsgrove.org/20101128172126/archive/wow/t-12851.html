<br />
Recently I was asked to step in as Druid Class Leader of my guild (I have NO idea what they were thinking with that).  I have to say that aside from tanking, I've little experience with other druid trees.  I've recently starting playing around with resto.  I healed Kara last night to get my toes wet and try things out.  My off-spec resto is about 1685+ heals and it went alright though I found we sort of hit a wall with Nightbane.  It was off-spec training night with my guild and we really ran into problems because I kept dying during the air phase.  I digress.<br />
<br />
Regardless, currently I'm supposed to be analyzing the new talent trees that will be released in the new patch.  I've been doing a lot of research, mostly on the feral tree because that's where I'm most comfortable. <br />
<br />
We are still torn on whether or not to continue raiding with the new talent trees and all that.  However, I was curious as to what people plan to spec at with the new talent trees at 70 before the expansion hits. <br />
<br />
If people wouldn't mind, I'd be really appreciative if you could take a few minutes to post a talent build and a note of what you plan to do for the remaining time.<br />
<br />
Such as PvP/Boomkin Raid/Feral DPS/Tank, etc.  <br />
<br />
I'm really curious especially for the Balance/Resto trees.  I've been reading a lot of theorycraft but I'd LOVE to get some opinions from people more experienced in those areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My latest personal theory craft has me thinking I will end up with all my points in feral for my tank spec now, except for Furor. My last 10 will go into LotP, R&amp;T, and KotJ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is my sorta first quick look.  this puts some points into the resto tree to start with as i'd like to get OOC back personally asap.<br />
<br />
i was thinking more about bear as i chose talents but i may need to rethink it in the end to be more cat based for levelling ?</div></div><hr />

Though I might move 3/3 NR to 3/3 PI as I'm not sure how many tanking talents I'll really need while I level.  I suspect 3/3 PotP is more than enough to get thru the 70-78 lvl 5-mans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone must stand ON or very near the tank for the air phase.  Do NOT cast any heals during this phase.  Otherwise, he'll go straight for you when he comes back down.  It ain't pretty but it works.  <br />
<br />
Anyway....good thread....I'll be studying everyone's builds myself.<br />
<br />
P.S.  +1685 for your off spec?  Kudos.  :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

Still really unsure what to do with the feral tree though ... with the new talents ... its hard to maximize tanking and dps builds even with all the points in the feral tree.</div></div><hr />

My guess is the 7th.  That gives them nearly a month on live, but only 3 weeks before they have to cut the CD.</div></div><hr />

hoping its out by or on the 8th cos i'm on holiday that week :)</div></div><hr />

I'm just honestly curious as to people's opinions.  I've been working with people the last couple of days in guild and they all seem to be blindly looking at me going 'halp with gear/spec/things' and I feel rather stupid so I like to understand reasonings rather than 'Just do this' when I give them advice. =x   <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Oiysters : I'm curious as to why you would take Rend and Tear over improved mangle/KotJ or Shredding Attacks for bear.  Did we hear yet on if it was going to work to increase the damage on mangle yet as well?  Again, I haven't been paying so much attention to the news/updates for LK yet so I might be behind on changes to talents or their particular uses.  I need friends in beta. =( <br />
 <br />
Kheldar: What are your thoughts on Survival instincts?  <br />
 <br />
Annik: Feral Aggression over Ferocity for PvP?  Is this because of the buffs it's getting?  Do you think FB will be worth the energy dump now?  <br />
<br />
Overlord: Is this a spec for grinding/raiding/PvP out of curiosity?  Do you feel that typhoon is going to be insanely useful.  Also your thoughts on Eclipse?  <br />
<br />
tlbj: Yeah, I imagine if it's anything like BC, you won't need to be hardcore tank to be able to make it through the regular 5 mans.  Gods, there are so many talents I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed.  <br />
<br />
Allahanaster: What are your thoughts on beserk at the moment?  <br />
<br />
Magellan: See I was rather confused by this.  I swear I waited a few good seconds to start healing once the skeletons were summoned but they all started attacking me and even though I healed through the first wave of attacks, I was suddenly dead.  I felt rather fail.  And yeah, I've been getting quite a lot of healing gear from our Kara runs because we mostly do it for badges so I'm always being tossed stuff for off-spec.  I'm a very lucky dr00d.  <br />
<br />
Ravnia: Hrm, out of curiosity what are your thoughts on Living Seed?  I've had some mixed discussion with other druids.  I heard that it's usefulness gets pretty mixed and the like.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you all so much for your input.  I'm going to be out of town for about a week so I might not get right back to you but I'm very eager to hear what you all have to say.<br />
<br />
Also if the patch is that far away I will be a VERY VERY happy druid.  I need a little bit more time to prepare and I did want to get a couple more Naxxramas runs in before it goes away to Northrend.  =D</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
I like the look of it and will definitely be taking it very early on as i level to 80.<br />
<br />
Its the sort of 'last stand' ability we've needed for big boss fights that we've been lacking.<br />
<br />
Suddenly being able to click 1 button and gain circa 5k HP will be a real party saver at times.  I guess i see it as more useful for running 5 mans and maybe even heroics and as such dont feel i need it immediately at 70 to start the levelling process.<br />
<br />
As mentioned i might even alter the spec i posted for levelling and go with more of a kitty bias. all depends how well i feel i can dps in kitty form with the build i posted.<br />
<br />
As i level i'd see myself adding :<br />
<br />
Protector of the Pack<br />
Survivial Instincts<br />
OOC<br />
<br />
Then the last few points are a bit harder...<br />
<br />
Primal Tenacity ?<br />
Natural &amp; Master Shapeshifter ?<br />
More points to Rend and Tear ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-25-2008, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Berserk is a fantastic talent.  As a tank druid its a great OMG agro manuver.  For kitty DPS its your burn em down dps manuver.  It makes things so cheap (20 energy shreds anyone?) that when you need that quick burst of hard core burn down its really really nice.  Its not a bad oh **** button either.</div></div><hr />

I like the burst damage of Ferocious Bite.  Most clothies don't recover from a 4k bite.. =)  No clue if it's the best way, but it's my own preferred way..<br />

Only becase the latest theorycrafting at EJ says the R&amp;T is going to be better threat gen than IM.  Unless something significant changes between now and release, I'll be speccing 0/66/5 at level 80 and will pick up IM, KotJ, and SA as I level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This spec is for grinding and as i progress through the levels i will use the next 10 pionts in<br />
<br />
2 more in natures grace - as its awlays good to get a starfire or wrath out quickly.<br />
1 in Natures focus <br />
2 in furor for added int<br />
3 in natuarl shape shifter for shifting for a quick HOT<br />
and 2 in master shapeshifter for the added spell damage<br />
http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0xGbuicoAdhAzRtZfbc0b<br />
<br />
as for eclipse i would rather have master shapeshifter for the added spell damage rather than the odd crit buff <br />
but as i have yet to test these they will probably all change lol<br />
<br />
i cant decide on a pvp spec as you have to have 20 points for feral charge <br />
i was looking at this at lvl 80 but really not sure<br />

master shapeshifter looks quite a nice talent ?</div></div><hr />

I highly favor the synergy of Living Seed with Swiftmend and Regrowth.  I know that our predominant healing spell is Lifebloom but having this extra tool can add wonders to our healing powers.</div></div><hr />
