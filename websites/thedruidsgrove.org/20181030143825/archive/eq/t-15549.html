here is quote from sony forums: <br />
 <br />
Completed fingers are showing up on lucy now. It appears they are a each combination of the phalanges+metacarpal. So 79948-79952 are thumb and fingers, and 79953 should be the final combination of the 6 intermediate combines. <br />

Been wanting to see more augs with well rounded stats like this for a while.  BiC is daunting even if you are in a high end guild, so something like this is nice for everyone.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I was very pleased when they introduced the Dain MM aug, and this is a nice improvement. <br />
 <br />
My only question is, does anyone know of or think there might be something similar for Chest slot?<br />
 <br />
Thanks)<br />

Only questionable &quot;solo&quot; is a summoning named for one of the tasks that you need to kill, though he is still pretty gimp and proved to be no problem at all for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">03-02-2007, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that you need to do a series of tasks associated with each of the isles in order to get all of the various bones.  Usually doing 1-2 tasks will cause later tasks involving that isle to start offering bones as reward choices.  Also, higher faction levels appear to offer more reward choices as well.<br />
<br />
     Basically, it looks like we need to do at least 5 diff missions for many of the isles to get the complete set of bones.  Some of the tasks (ie a batch for monkey isle, from the trophy hunter mob) are offered in the barren coast.<br />
<br />
     Do every quest you see, get faction up...those seem to be the keys.<br />

Graffe guy says they're a pain, but that's an understatement.  The map from mapfiend has them marked even, but on Xegony no PH exist in either hut marked, and killing all mobs in every other hut hasn't helped either.</div></div><hr />

Under water, in the huts, in the buliding, on the bridge, roaming the shore, etc.     Would not be surprised for them both to be just random rare from any zone trash.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">03-04-2007, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well..assuming you download the maps from here www.mapfiend.net (http://www.mapfiend.net) all the chests are marked on the map but one and that one is easy. simply walk along the north side of the island on the beach (walk on the waterline but stay on land) and about in the middle of the north side and on the beach you will see the chest with the charts in them next to a rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noken</div><div class="date">03-04-2007, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">chests can also be tracked</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micahle</div><div class="date">03-04-2007, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, can't track the maidens grave ones. I also do have maps and not one of the marked places had a chest.. i swam around in circles for about an hour and found them in completely random spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my mistake..i assumed when u mentioned charts you meant navigation charts from redfeather isle, and those are always in the same spot and are trackable and that was what my post was on.<br />
 <br />
   if you are talking about the sea charts from maiden's grave then i too found them in completely random spots and the map was totally un-reliable since the marked places didnt have chests, and these chests were not on my track list.<br />
 <br />
   but if this is the same quest im thinking of then since all the chests have the same thing inside you can simply locate one chest and then wait on the respawn (7 mins i believe) <br />
 <br />
    when i did this task i did it 3 times for the faction boost and i found that even tho the maps were off as far as the chest indicators, when i did finally locate a chest it would re-spawn in approx. the same area each time so if need be you can just camp one chest 4 times for the loot.<br />
 <br />
  correct me if this isnt the quest you are talking about as im only trying to be helpful for anyone else who might read this and have trouble with the same quest.</div></div><hr />

Loot one chest, and it could respawn in any of a few different places.  Just swim around and pay attention, like people had to do in the old days before pre-marked maps, and you'll get this done :)</div></div><hr />

You're saying that they both can also drop knight booty. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it's the same old grind of &quot;kill some mobs until you get enough uncommon drops&quot;, but I like that there are small, achievable bite-sized goals that you can tick off in half an hour of play, and I like that they add up to a significant end-result.<br />
