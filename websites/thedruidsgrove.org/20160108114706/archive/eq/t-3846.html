At level 3 imagine how this scales. 2500 heal, 90ac and 55 damage shield or something. And it is not very point heavy, first train took 4 points and it says next train will only take 3 points. I will be investing in this. Unfortunately, the time doesnt decrease supposedly.</div></div><hr />

Unless the new 5k heal takes to it, is an absolute waste of time.   Tunares heal is capped at 2925, and in group raids, or groups, thats all you will be using for a long time. H healing adept and criticals dont take to tunares renewal. And I dont suspect that many people will be finding or getting the 5k heal soon. And if they do I bet healing adept and criticals wont take to it either. so, healing adept and criticals at THIS time, is a 100% waste of points and time. <br />

It's an excellent emergency ability for single groups that doesn't waste a spell slot and can be cast instantly in times of need.<br />
<br />
By the way, although Lucy says this skill lasts 5 ticks, it did 7 ticks when I tested it.  It's possible the reinforcement AAs modify it, since I have all 3 spell reinforcement levels and spell reinforcement mastery.</div></div><hr />

If you heal everyone in the grp for the full 1250 thats 7500 hp healed for free every 22 mins. Can't say thats bad =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can cast it wherever you want, it's instant cast, and it leaves a buff icon that looks like primal essence (criss-crossed swords) while it's working.  Unfortunately, it doesn't turn your party into trees.<br />
<br />
I agree that a lower refresh time would be useful and not unbalancing.  If it were more around the 5 minute mark, this spell could be more of a real group heal instead of just an emergency ability.  In fact, I'd rather have the next two levels of the ability reduce the reuse time than slightly increase the strength.</div></div><hr />

Even for regular exp groups having that extra mana free heal can often save a groups lives.</div></div><hr />

DOes this stack with ROTG or more importantly Replenishment.  And does it stack with Damage shields?  I'm thinking on getting this ability for raids, but I'd like to know what it does/doesn't stack with if someone who has it would be willing to post that here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ardur Iskall</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have stacked with replenishment, natures recovery and sheild of blades, no probs.<br />
<br />
I stacked it with Mage DS once and at that time I am quite sure Shielf of the eitgth was on the tank too.<br />
<br />
I have also had dots/slows on party members and it has not been a problem with those either, it takes a spellslot though, so make sure to have one open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiirem</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the stacking info, I'm got it right away.<br />
Just used it together with MGB for uber spam at a Rhag2 raid.  The whole guild got 1000HP heal, this aa kicks @#%$.  I used my AA points meant to go to SCM3, but that will have to wait some more.  I can't wait to use this on AE mobs.  Now I might save MGB for this instead of regrowth on those.<br />
<br />
PS: For anyone from Sony reading this.  It didn't really work it sucks don't change it!</div></div><hr />

Cast that over a raid of 60 and that's a &lt;strong&gt;105k&lt;/strong&gt; heal...<br />
<br />
The instant cast makes it more useful still.  Satisfying?  ^_^<br />

Very happy with this skill so far.</div></div><hr />
