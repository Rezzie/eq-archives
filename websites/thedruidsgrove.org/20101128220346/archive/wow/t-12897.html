Anyone have a quote to this as I cannot read 99% of any of the sites while at work. 3.) WTF are we suppose to do with all this agi?  Now we will have to swap out for all + dodge gems?  Terrible.</div></div><hr />

I don't have the ratings in front of me, but it is significant.  Maybe a 30% loss?  And it gets worst as you level to 80.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hypnotiq</div><div class="date">10-10-2008, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Side question.  Head enchants and shoulder enchants.  Think we should swap for dps enchants or just keep what we have?  What do you guys think would be more viable?  Now that I do not need my defense rings and resil bracers I am gonna have a lot more hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hypnotiq</div><div class="date">10-10-2008, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like I will be stacking more stam or straight dodge. Cause I am gonna need more dodge.  I think I will swap all my agi gems for dodge or stam.</div></div><hr />

I think we pick up more from bear form, plus there is a new talent that gives us 6% dodge.  It it the folks that are in T6+ that lose the most.  I think might have actually gained dodge when I copied my T4 bear to the PTR.<br />
<br />
I did read that some of the theory crafters are saying we (bears), might want to start stacking +sta over +agi once we reach a fairly low level of dogde.  Especially since there are now diminishing returns on dodge.</div></div><hr />

I am raiding t6 content now until expac.  With all the agi on the gear and my gems and enchants I have a lot of agi.  Which if it dummies down will that 6% compensate for what I lose?  I have not read the post becuase when I get home I do not enjoy reading about this stuff.  I always try to read while at work.<br />
<br />
I will be switching to my stranglestaff now for added ap.  earthwarden doesn't seem as good anymore.  Just seems as a weapon for expertise.</div></div><hr />

Until we get quite a few folks at lvl 80, it really won't matter.  So, just stick with the BC line of thinking until then.<br />

By Xmas, we'll probably have a go handle on what is &quot;good&quot;.  Beside, I would expect a patch, or 2, or 7 :grin: between now and Xmas.  Heck we could have 3 patches next week.</div></div><hr />
