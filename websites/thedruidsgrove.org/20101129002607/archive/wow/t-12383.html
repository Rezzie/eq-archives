<br />
I'm a lvl 70 Balance Druid, and serve as DPS Bomb in my Guild's instance raids....<br />
<br />
I'm currently in BG gear with a mix of blues and purps thrown.... <br />
<br />
As we're all becoming familiar with Kara, everyone is upgrading their gear, but I'm not sure where I should set my sights... What gear do you guys recommend?<br />
<br />
Mind you I'm currently at the top of the DPS pool, my mana lasts decently and sometimes have trouble stealing aggro...<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice!<br />

Also take spell hit and haste whenever you can get it.</div></div><hr />

Any gem slots I have I put in spell hit gems. Right now I have 3pieces of season 1 pvp gear as there isn't much caster leather to be found in raids.<br />
<br />
I also highly suggest badge gear. The shoulders are awesome and so is the belt. Right now I'm saving up for the boots. Oh and don't forget the idol! It rocks and procs a lot.<br />
<br />
Anything that is an upgrade from any leather that you're wearing (including cloth) is worth getting. Since there isn't caster leather in raids then wear cloth or badge gear until you can get your hands on tier pieces.<br />
<br />
Edit: Feel free to check out my armory if you want to look at my gear. Just a note that I'm working on getting the season 1 staff (it is godly and has spell hit) Angiem (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Exodar&amp;n=Angiem)</div></div><hr />
