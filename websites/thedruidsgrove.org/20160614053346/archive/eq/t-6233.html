So I'm looking at pet DPS plus whatever the main class could add itself in other damage through nukes and DoTs.  Other factors to take into account would be things like mages being able to summon haste items for pets, and weapons, and mod rods which would add some extra mana regen.  Necros can lich mana back.  Shaman can canni, Beastlords have mana regen spells, etc.<br />
<br />
My initial thought is (pet-wise) BL &gt; MAG &gt; NEC &gt; SHM, but once you add in the damage done by the mains, it's probably a bit closer.  I'm not really considering melee done by the mains for this comparison.<br />
<br />
If you could pick two to group with your druid, what would you pick?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to hearing your opinions!<br />

Opinion here, but seems kinda messed up to skew this by saying Minus Mains melee output.   You want to see who puts out the most DPS of the pet classes, but for one class you want to exclude much of their DPS input (im refering to Beastlord).  Yet, include Mages Nukes and necro Dots?<br />
<br />
Thats like saying...  lets see who can hold aggro better of the taunting classes, but SK's and Pallys cant use spells.  Or saying who puts out more DPS out of the melee, but dont count rogues backstabs.<br />
<br />
Would think it better to say which pet classes pet does the most DPS, when self buffed by the owner (to include mages summoned gear).<br />
<br />
Or jsut put it all on the plate,  Which Pet class does the most dps, with pet and character fully self buffed (again to include mages summoned gear).</div></div><hr />

In that case, the BL couldn't do any melee, since I'd be driving the druid or necro.  But it's easy to reach across and tap a macro which /assists and casts a nuke or DoT.<br />

Someone asks for an opinion....well I got one so I guess I will just spit it out. If you lined these 4 side by side and places the same mob in front of them and said &quot;Sickim&quot;...I would think the Mage would when. However, if you lined these same four up and had 10 mobs in a line to take down 1 at a time....I would think the Necro would finish his 10 mobs prior to the rest. But of course this is just my thoughts and not playing any of these.......they are just thoughts. Becareful of what you ask for, hehehehehe. Take care and remember to feed your pets, lol.<br />

Shamans unknown, they spend too much time slowing and malo'ing to rate themselves.  Not to mention,they run their dot numbers up to high, they just die and tank their DPS for any length of fight.<br />

<br />
At level 65, minus focus effects, a shaman can maintain 1242 damage per tick, with just 4 dots, which works out to ~210DPS.  Shamans lack any sort of aggro management utility, so DPS is limited in a lot of raid fights, tho stuff like permarooted mobs, where aggro is built to insane levels before the engage, a shaman can easily pump out 200k damage or more, and do a full 210DPS.<br />
<br />
Also, shamans get 2 nice rain spells, and a decent 1k nuke, and iirc, chaining those also does ~225DPS, and is less aggro, since there are no counters placed on the mob.<br />
<br />
I watched a level 63 necro (with more AA than me, and 2 levels higher) in Nadox the other day, camping the room just inside the entrance from gunthak, at the hidden wall.  I can assure you that his kill rate was signifigantly lower than what mine would be in that same room, and his pet got clobbered by the mobs, and I watched it drop to 10% or less a few times.  Conversely, he can aggro-kite in HoH and kill mobs a bit faster than me root-rotting them, so it evens out.<br />
<br />
As for shamans lacking aggro reduction (and we need it even more than druids), it doesnt matter when you are solo-tanking the mobs anyways.  You can pump out all the dps you want and not worry about aggro.<br />
<br />
I run about 120-150DPS or so when I solo, and thats with only 14AA at 61 with only highend bazaar gear and all my spells.  That is on par with mages and necros, and as pointed out earlier, in close quarters, or with summoning mobs, shamans easily take the top rank.  <br />
<br />
As for the 1 mob speed, I would put the order as mage, bl, necro, shaman.  As for the 10 mobs 1-by-1, I would do necro, bl, mage, shaman, unless they summon, then I would do shaman/bl (rather tied), then necro, and mage would die most likely.  10 mobs, 2 at a time, I would do shaman, necro, with mage and bl possibly dieing if the mobs are tough.<br />
<br />
My usual hunting area is nadox, and I have watched many a mage or bl get an add, and die to it, because they lack any sort of CC skills.<br />
<br />
If you are wanting a class to aggro-kite with the character, I would go with shaman or necro, as mage and bl pets have too much aggro, and will make it hard to kite, plus, aggro-kiting a 75% slowed, malo'd, crippled mob is NO risk, even if you get hit, you wont get stunned long enough to die.  Same cant be said for the necro, as they cant debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatankawd</div><div class="date">01-10-2004, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I must admit, my first thought was to go Shaman and Necro, but I think Mage and Beastlord have a lot to offer as well.  I'm still leaning Shaman/Necro, but will give it a few more days to get talked out of it =)<br />
<br />
The nice thing about Shaman and Necro is if there's no room for kiting, but root/rot still works, then there's still plenty of DoTs to cast.  And with the Shaman slowing, the pets may be able to tank some non-kitable mobs.  And both have great self-mana regen (canni and lich).<br />
<br />
Mages can summon lots of neat toys though, and can summon mod rods for extra whole-group mana regen.  Beastlords get great pets, slow, and another full group mana-regen buff.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm in no hurry to start them, so we'll see what other points can be raised.<br />

Necro's are my personal favorite class to group with because of their massive DPS.  Shammy would just be an extra to keep your HP's up while agro kiting.  But really it just depends on what you want to do.  BL crack is one of the reasons i personally like to keep them around. Mages are really just a vending machine but their pets are realy really bad ass. Thats my two cp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accretion</div><div class="date">01-12-2004, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beastlords are the most powerful class in EQ right now....period.  Having said that, they lose usefulness in many raid situations and can be very high maintenence if relied upon to buff a lot as many of their buffs are the 36-54 min. variety and SCRM isn't usually high on their list of desired AAs.<br />
<br />
Beastlord<br />
Pro: Slow, Outstanding DPS, Nice Buffs, Can Tank in Tier 3 (if needed), High Aggro (nice for Aggro kiting)<br />
Con: Potentially High-Maintenence (tougher for 3-boxing), Pet Push<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
Pro: Outstanding DPS, Summoned Goodies, CoTH, Debuffs, Easier to Bot<br />
Con: Fragile, Less Utility<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Pro: Slow, Buffs (although they benefit melee more than caster), Canni, High Aggro, Heals, DoTs<br />
Con: Lower DPS (especially taking into account resists) <br />
<br />
Necro<br />
Pro: Utility, Outstanding DPS, FD, Undead Mez/Charm/Slow, Corpse Summoning/Rez, High Aggro, DoTs<br />
Con: Fragile<br />
<br />
Overall, if you had to choose 2 classes to group with (PCs) I think the Beastlord + Necro would be hard to beat.  The main obstacle with that group is (frankly) it would be much tougher to 3-box, IMO.  Beastlords are much tougher to bot than plate tanks IMO due to their pet push and need to rely on spells to maintain aggro.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'd keep the Necro in the mix as he'd give you Rez.  Trust me, you'll need it =P<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I currently 3-box a Paladin, Enchanter and Druid and find that combination unbelievably fun, not to mention very powerful.</div></div><hr />

I have a necro as a main and I gotta say that the necro you saw camping the zone in area in Nadox could not have been very good if he wasnt owning it. I am only lvl 56 with my necro and I solo many different spots in nadox with ease, at 63 he has the 2nd best pet in the game(for necro's). If he wasnt stepping in to lifetap tank for his pet or at least healing his pet then he wasnt playing his class effectivley. That said I will agree wholeheartedly that you shammies can take a beating a little better than us, and the ability to slow live mobs is something I yearn for sometimes. As far as crowd control, again if he couldnt deal with adds with ease then he wasnt playing his class effectivley. I am constantly playing CC, wether it is by offtanking adds or root/mezzing if they are mezzable, sometimes i just use charm to deal with an add if it is undead and add some extra DPS for a couple minutes. In fact I serve as CC so often I am actually looking forward to the day when all mobs I encounter are over lvl 55 so I cant mezz em, I am sick of keeping that one memed. hehehehehe<br />
<br />
So please dont let one necro sway you on what we can do, you would be amazed at some of the things we can do, kinda like druids  :cheers:</div></div><hr />

BST has everything DRU needs, slow, can tank a ton of mobs (and not just his pet can tank).  I have been using the combo sucessfully for quite some time.  If you want to add a third class, pick a low maintence DPS class like necro.  Necro will also add a few things your team didnt have before, Summoning, rezzing and FD pulling.  You will be the complete package :P<br />

(or in my case...0,6,4,3,3,3,.....)<br />
<br />
Mod rods provide a limited form of mana regen.  It is (no disrespect to mages) a pretty simple class to bot (versus actively pla)y, maybe marginally harder than a cleric.<br />
<br />
Doing praesertums I would much rather have a BL than a mage, but BL, shammy and mage in combination makes them easy (still painfully long, but easy).</div></div><hr />

I'd tend to go with a Necromancer for his FD / and Rezz abilities.  I think the other one I'd go for is a shaman being a high dps class with a pet.  Why this over a beastlord or mage?  Your necromancer is going to produce gobs more mana than either of the others, a shaman can kind of keep up with his canni skills.  Your necro feeds the druid, and you come out about even on mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For if your wanting to pick up some nice items, or camp cash drops in the old dungeons then a beastlord is probably the best choice.<br />
<br />
You said you would be 3 boxing - what is the 3rd class (Druid, whatever you pick here and ?), that would influence the choice somewhat as well?</div></div><hr />

Shamans dots are letal but they have no way of clearing aggro when its on them. Necros can FD to lose aggro. Oh and btw Accretion necros get a standard mez not just and undead mez. Only problem with screaming terror is that it only lasts about 10secs and then needs reapplied. Also only allows for a 2 mez rotation to be affective. With 2 adds a necro can handle them just fine. Get a third and then theres trouble.<br />
Mages are great as a pet class along with beastlords. But i would personally say Necros and Shamans better.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, all your DPS goes out the window while the Necro tries to keeps the mob(s) locked down.  I'll agree that a Necro is an awesome companion, but an Enchanter will give greater flexibility for the overall group IMO.</div></div><hr />
