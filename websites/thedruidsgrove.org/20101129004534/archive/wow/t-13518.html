<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">12-09-2009, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree with Magellan.  Teddie, one of the greatest things about this grove is just the huge sense of family here.  When I first stumbled onto the grove, I was clueless on druiding.  I've asked probably hundreds of really &quot;noobie&quot; questions, but never have gotten anything but gentle and awesome guidance here.<br />
<br />
And, you really wouldn't need to know much about druiding to comment on my blog.  I mean, one of the most recent entries was about how much I love Arthas.  I believe Khel is now convinced that I'm 100% out of my mind... I can't help it...he's Arthas!!! <br />
<br />
It's easy to make friends here, for sure =)  Even the bears are friendly =D /rawr<br />
<br />
By the way, the new heroic is FUN!!!!!  Lots of AoE damage it seems, but the two boss fights I got to see last night were really cool!  I was sad that the other instance servers were down.  It would have been really cool to see more!</div></div><hr />

yes i am convinced Des is off her trolley !<br />

<br />
yeah the new 5 man place looks kewl. just done all 3 parts on normal.<br />
<br />
some good looking loot, ok only 219 but nice looking items. lots of eot and eof.<br />

and yeah none of my addons were working but some nice big pack pulls so i am hoping my dps will see a nice increase with aoe :)</div></div><hr />

Well, anyway, I just wanted to say that i miss the grove, and i hope more people come to contribute to this peaceful community, which is by far the best wow related forum around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">12-11-2009, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amen, Aral!  It's good to see you stopping by to say hello =)<br />
<br />
Smart, it's at Little Bear Tree (http://little-bear-tree.blogspot.com/).<br />
<br />
It really only got started because Khel &lt;3's how noobish I am, and my failures seem to be a good source of giggles for him =)<br />
<br />
I don't mind.  It's actually been kind of cool to keep a blog about WoW.  I know it seems kind of dumb.  It seemed dumb to me at first too, but sometimes I go back and read some of them again and think, &quot;Wow...hehe I can't believe I even did that...&quot;  <br />
<br />
A story that's not posted yet, but I'll hopefully get posted soon:  The story about when we decided to go for the achievement on Anomalus and the one guildie says, &quot;Des, kite him backwards down the path...&quot;  so I did...and off the platform I went.  hehe Needless to say, no achievement for that run.  The best part?  It happened just a month or two ago.  Moral of the story:  Environmental Awareness is very important, especially for tanks =)<br />
<br />
<br />
As Aral said, this is by far the friendliest and kindest of wow forums out there, so don't be afraid to post or ask questions.  I mean, ask Khel- I still ask questions and post stuff that probably leaves fellow grove members scratching their heads wondering how on earth I even got to 80...but I've learned a LOT from the druids here doing so. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah some good stuff on it Des :)<br />
<br />
hehe Des, we all ask questions no doubt that to others seem soo easy.  its why its such a great source of info and help here in the grove :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">12-14-2009, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed Khel.<br />
<br />
I'm sure my failbits make for giggles for a lot of folks.  I know the guildies get a kick out of my random stories in /gchat.  It usually starts with...&quot;Grrrr...so guess what I just did...&quot;<br />
<br />
Then they usually just wait to see what story unfolds for them lol. <br />
<br />
Edit:  I just found out that they've killed the project for Cartographer.  Now, it's not a huge issue with the new quest objectives map...however...there is one feature from cartographer that Des does NOT function well without...<br />
<br />
When using Cartographer, I was able to see parts of the map that I hadn't yet explored or discovered.  Are there other addons that would give that functionality?  Only reason I ask is in one of the random pugs I was in, we wiped in Sunken Temple and I couldn't find my way back because that was the first time my warlock had ever been to that zone...ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's one for ya:  <br />
<br />
Was flying high above Storm Peaks on my way to an Ulduar raid.  I noticed that my mage enchanter friend was just below me at the bottom of the mountains headed to the same raid.<br />
<br />
I whispered him to see if he would enchant something and he said &quot;sure&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Don't move, I'm just above you.  I'll freefall until I get to ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
I started the freefall, and being so high in the air, I decided I time to prepare my headset for vent.  Got the headset tangled in my hair (which hurt A LOT) and remembered my poor freefalling character just in time to watch her SPLAT right next to my mage friend.<br />
<br />
He whispered, &quot;LOL!  Is that you?!?&quot;  <br />
<br />
I was laughing hysterically, and begged him not to mention it to the raid.<br />
<br />
He assured me it would be our little secret.<br />
<br />
I finally got the headset untangled from my hair, logged into vent and immediately:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mags!  First day as a bird?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mags!  How's your face?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mags!  Fly much?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mags!  Should I throw you a net?  Maybe a pillow?&quot;<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
I thanked the Mage for his discretion, and joined in on the fun.  <br />
<br />
:beerchug:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking of mages and falling...we were going to run H:HoL the one night- a few of us guildies.  The mage was on his way to the summon stone - I was flying around picking a few herbs.<br />
<br />
When he got to the summon stone, he whispered me to tell me he was there and ready to summon.  I get to the stone and don't see him anywhere.<br />
<br />
Hmm...so I ask where he is, he says &quot;Omw down&quot; <br />
<br />
Plunk!  There plops the mage right before me at the stone!  He ice blocked so he didn't take any fall damage.<br />
<br />
Made me giggle.  We summon everyone and head into the instance.  When we got done he says, &quot;Des, don't take the portal, we'll walk out.&quot;<br />
<br />
I listened to him and we get outside.  He says, &quot;Fly up with me, and then just drop.  I'll ice-block you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I, knowing nothing about mage's abilities at the time, did exactly that and splattered in the center of a group of horde and fellow allies.<br />
<br />
There were only a few jokes made in /g about how gullible I am. <br />
<br />
Moral of both stories:  Don't trust mages.  Ever.</div></div><hr />

Also, I've been posting on a warlock forum- The Warlock's Den.  Just casually discussing the specs available and leveling and stuff.  That forum is very different from our grove.  Here, everyone is warm and cozy- bears snuggling with boomkins, trees cuddling with kitties...Over there...it's &quot;You'll know when you're a true warlock when you look at your friends only as souls that you can shard to use to summon your demons later&quot;.  =O  <br />

<br />
It's a true story, though.  And my story to them was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me see if I'm a true warlock.<br />
<br />
I went into Warsong Gulch.  I beat the snot out of a Blood Elf Warlock- and drained his soul.  I put that soul shard in the bank as a trophy, and was extremely and infinitely excited to have a blood elf soul.  Am I a true warlock yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
I got a resounding &quot;Welcome to the dark side, warlock!&quot; hehe<br />
<br />
Oh oh, and I've posted Des's Christmas Wish list on LBT (http://little-bear-tree.blogspot.com/)...hoping I can get some stories from friends to post up there in a sort of &quot;summing up the year&quot; compilation.  If you want to throw a story (even with instructions to change names etc)- my email is mydruidrocks@aol.com<br />
<br />
Really hoping I can get a few stories in the old Inbox to put together for my 2009 wrap-up.</div></div><hr />

yeah i posted on your Xmas Wish List earlier.<br />
<br />
trouble is i dont have exciting or n00b stories like you do ! :p<br />
<br />
i dont get to play enough tbh and when i do its with guildies and friends.....which is why i detest this random dungeon cr4p and the change to the daily heroic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not expecting much, given the holidays are pressing down on us all and I doubt any of us will have time.  I should write a post about what I learned in Blade's Edge last night...evidently, if the felcannons hit you while you're in swift flight form (even at level 80), it knocks you OUT of flight form...if you're up high enough...you die.  Who knew?<br />

Next Mission:  Getting the Death Knoob to 80.  I got her from 71 to 76 over vacation, leveled her blacksmithing and mining...=) super exciting!<br />
<br />
Is it bad that I find it amusing that the weekend's guild drama has carried over onto facebook?  I was both saddened and amused by this at the same time...</div></div><hr />

Of course, that's based on reading up on it after you talked about it on facebook- and all the info was from web sources- so who knows how up-to-date or accurate it is lol<br />

I saw his show on tv not too long ago.  My husband thought I was positively insane because I was SO excited and made him watch it with me.  He wouldn't have laughed except for how excited I was.  It was great =D  I never understood the humor when I was a little girl, but I remember sitting there next to my dad when he watched it and he would chuckle, so I would laugh too. <br />
<br />
I always remembered him running around to his crazy music...man..I kinda miss Benny Hill now...</div></div><hr />
