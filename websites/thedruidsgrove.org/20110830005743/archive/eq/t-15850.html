<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teialiscious</div><div class="date">05-11-2007, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings everyone. It's been awhile since my virtual travels have brushed against the good grove. Once upon a good night I wondered... gee - I wonder how the heck Yeraie is doin'. Without much ado at all I re-upped for a month to see what I could learn. First of all - I learned that Yeraie doesn't play anymore! That was a big disappointment - but I digress...<br />
<br />
I happened upon a seeming disturbance. When the Splash page for EQ lit up my screen I noticed something very very subtle. Firiona Vie is becoming a man!<br />
<br />
I worked up some images from the past and present to display the transformation:<br />
<br />
This first look is Firiona in her original Everquest 1.0 Box simple beauty.<br />

<br />
As time went on things did not change much. Firiona remained a soft beautiful creature. Here is her visage from the Planes of Power expansion:<br />

<br />
And then things might change a bit... some age with grace - some age with shorter heads and larger jawbones. Here is what happened at the Dragon's of Norrath Release:<br />

<br />
No subtleties were left. The transformation went fast. Firiona is not fully actualized, but within a few expansions she'll know its true. It takes awhile to start being ok with the idea that you are indeed a mangina. It all ends happy though Firiona, trust me. You'll get there!<br />

<br />
But aye.... I like pic #2 the best.</div></div><hr />
