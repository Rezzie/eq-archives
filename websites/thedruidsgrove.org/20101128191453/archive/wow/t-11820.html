<br />
I ran (4) Instances this past weekend, and NOT ONCE did I win a Roll for Loot.  NOTHING!  I get general corpse loot, of course, but I can't seem to win any rolls.  Is it just me?  Am I doing something wrong???<br />
<br />
(2) Were with a raid group and the other (2) were with a standard group.<br />
<br />
If it matters, the dungeons were Uldaman, Zul Farrak (twice) and Sunken Temple.....</div></div><hr />

My T4 shoulders have dropped every week for the last 4 weeks from the High King.  Every week I have been out rolled, with this week mocking me with a roll of a 1.  *sigh*  Eventually I'll get them because everyone else will already have them! LOL</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I really hate it when people &quot;need&quot;  things....although, they are always polite and ask first, we all &quot;need&quot; things....I've never actually done it.  Perhaps it's time I try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">06-07-2007, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My general rules for any BOP is to have everyone pass.  Unless its a situation where the person will use it immediately and they are the only one there (i.e. the only priest, pally etc...)  Then I always let people discuss.  Two people can need that way and just roll off.  it keeps it nice and fair for everyone.<br />
<br />
On BOEs, I always roll need if its an immediate upgrade and I'll equip it that second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is how things have gone for me in groups at least....<br />
<br />
Pick &quot;Need&quot; if it is an upgrade to an item you are using currently and ask before picking &quot;Need&quot;  <br />
<br />
+( I will only need for Feral/tanking items and even if it is an upgrade to my dps or healing set I will &quot;greed&quot; it unless the group, which happened a few times, told me to &quot;Need&quot; it.)<br />
<br />
Pick &quot;Greed&quot; if it is going to be vendor trashed or disenchanted.(Have had enchanters go need then disenchant for folks to /random 100 for the resources made.)<br />
<br />
Anyone that &quot;Needs&quot; an item that they can not use(good example was a group mate hitting Need after everyone hit &quot;greed&quot; on a healer type item and the person was not a healing class.  They were asked what was up and they coudl not give a reason and thus kicked from teh group adn quickly replaced.</div></div><hr />
