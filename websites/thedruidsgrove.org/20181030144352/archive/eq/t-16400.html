 <br />
The praetorian focus effects are now degraded, this new gear is trade-able so you can get it from friends or in the bazaar, it just drops off boss's from what i hear, definately way way easier to get, and its better.<br />
 <br />
Congrats should go out to sony for setting a record for the fastest ive seen in a long time for making an expansion obsolete. is there a point for me to try and get all this new gear? will another expansion come out in july that has new levels, degrades and obsoletes all my new focuses, or just puts out better gear thats easier to get?<br />
 <br />
with perhaps the hand aug or maybe some of the raid content being an exception, they have dealt a death blow to tbs. <br />
 <br />
But i guess thats a sign of the times: with so many mmo's out there, and many friends i know that pretty much reach the aa/level cap shortly after every expansion release, they get bored and try new games.<br />
 <br />
What i cant figure out is why they didnt expand the focus's on the praetorian gear. I spent so much time, and died so many times over and over, and now some ebay'd account can buy some online plat...run to the bazaar, and have better gear and better bazaar sold focus effects than the stuff i worked and worked for. <br />
 <br />
The new gear is all around better, has more ac, better hp/mana, better mods, the focus's clock in at a higher % from what i hear, and has more slots for augments. <br />
 <br />
At the very least they could do is upgrade the katta focus effects i worked so hard to get and make them work to lvl 80. What harm could that possibly do? if a dis-honest ebay'er can buy in bazaar lvl 80 focus effects in every category then why shouldnt som1 who worked and worked katta faction have lvl 80 focus effects? there would still be lots of reasons to get the new gear, and if sombody put the amount of time and effort to get ally katta faction..then spent all that orux, then they at least deserve focus's to 80. Now there is absolutely no reason at all to go to katta castrum. why would they? <br />
 <br />
All the people laugh in my face when i tell them how long it took me to get my gear, because they say &quot;i bought online plat and went to bazaar, it took me 5 mins, ha ha, have fun spending another month or 2 either camping the new gear or building the plat to buy it, dork.&quot;<br />
 <br />
I look back at all the time spent in katta tasks and it just seems to be wasted time, and i gotta start all over again re-placing out-dated focus effects. I dont really care about armor stats and mods, as im happy with what i have. But it really upset me to lose my focus stuff, and to see better trade-able bazaar gear for abt every Character slot in the game than all the no-drop gear that i spent so much time in tbs/tss getting.(currently my gear is all no drop and close to the stats contained in the Praetorian gear) and sure enough i see better being sold.<br />
 <br />
I would rather spend my time enjoying the new content, rather than constantly replacing gear that was'nt easy to get because sony likes to make me waste my time. How old is Katta gear? is it really time for it to be phased out already? they extended the epic stuff and its from oow for crying out loud.<br />
 <br />
The main &quot;core&quot; of tbs was the Factioning for the katta gear. and it makes no sense that, with all the commitment ppl put into it, sony is just tossing the katta castrum part into the rain gutter and letting in run down into the sewers.<br />
 <br />
I was pretty excited about this new expansion when it first came out till i reached 80 and my gear turned into crap. i have'nt played the game for quite awile now because i just feel like any amount of time i put into my gear won't matter because sony will do it again with the next expansion.<br />
 <br />
I dont think this expansion should have had gear up-grades with all the other content, it was not needed. with new lvls,spells,raid content,augs,etc... there is plenty of new content to explore without the need to de-grade tbs praetorian Foci.</div></div><hr />

Your Katta focus effects are _not_ worthless; a 30% focus effect is 22% at level 80, making a 30% @L80 focus effect a minor (though still worthwhile) upgrade.<br />
<br />
More importantly, they have provided a path to some impressive gear (which is NOT tradeable).  This is the quality of gear you have to look forward to, without any raiding:<br />

This won't help your angst, Elric, but I wanted to point out that you can sell your Katta gear back to the vendor and buy powersources with the proceeds. The SoF gear has Purity so the power sources work the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you need Ally faction to get the container to combine it, and you have to kill some high end mobs to get the core.. So I would think its going to be a bit longer.  They have to faction up, and a druid actually has to win the core ;)  -- you know they are giving them to clerics and tanks first.</div></div><hr />

Given that the attunable tier 3 non-vis drops give you the rank II focii, this doesn't make a lot of sense to me... but there you have it.  Maybe it'll get a boost at tier 3.</div></div><hr />

Self quoting isn't cool, I know - but further update - seems some focii are upgrade once you steam core your gear, and others aren't (eg: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=100245).  I'll wait with baited breath...</div></div><hr />

    Your Druadic Hide Wristguard is showing 4 augmentation slots. A type 7, A type 13, a type 1 and a type 2.   <br />
 <br />
    I have the same Wristguard however I did not attune mine prior to adding the core and am showing only 2 augment slots a type 7 and a type 13.   Were your Type 1 and type 2 augment slots present when you first attuned the item or how did they come to be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">01-02-2008, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The type 1 and 2 augment slots are &quot;hidden&quot; aug slots related to how power source bonuses are implemented on Infusible armor.  All infusible items (items that are affected by power sources) have these aug slots.<br />
<br />
On any item, each aug slot has a corresponding field that indicates whether the aug slot should be displayed (and whether augments can be inserted normally).  Think of the type 30 aug slot for the epic 2.0 to be used by the epic 2.5 augment; I believe this was the first time an invisible aug slot was used.<br />
<br />
Lucy has started to hide aug slots marked as invisible.  Magelo has not.  On Lucy you can look at the raw data and see:<br />
aug1type = 7 (first aug slot is Type 7)<br />
aug1vis = 1 (first aug slot is visible)<br />
aug2type = 13 (second aug slot is Type 13)<br />
aug2vis = 1 (second aug slot is visible)<br />
aug3type = 1 (third aug slot is Type 1)<br />
aug3vis = 0 (third aug slot is NOT visible)<br />
aug4type = 2 (fourth aug slot is Type 2)<br />
aug4vis = 0 (fourth aug slot is NOT visible)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Focus effects are a huge part of any gear decision.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is with Beneficial Spell Haste, since our &quot;Fast&quot; heal has a cast time of 3.75.  Right now, unless the Beneficial Spell Haste is 30% or higher, I think I'll be using CoA level items forever.  Another 50 HP or mana isn't going to help my group when they die because my heal is a slug.<br />
<br />
As for other focus effects, I guess I'll take the loss from moving to the new items but no way can I let my Heal speed drop.  Not even 0.1 of a second.</div></div><hr />

I think the latter was because of the squabbling over specific spell focus (eg Anguish or Demi BPs), originally intended for class specific BPs, and never settled on.  Just a guess though.</div></div><hr />
