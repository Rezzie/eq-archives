That leaves shamans and druids.  Shamans are usually aggroing a slowed mob (the slow causes aggro) and have passable tanking ability.  Druids have absolutely no way to escape with their lives in case for whatever reason (debuff, healing the wrong person at the wrong time) they get aggro.<br />
<br />
Now, I rarely get aggro, but it would be nice to have such an ability just in case.  Shamans and Druids both need aggro reducers of some kind...........<br />
<br />
/sigh, lost cause</div></div><hr />

Raids are a different story of course since Shaman can be among the first to die getting a slow in in the first place ; ).

<br />
/discs do not change the current amount of aggro that you have.<br />
<br />
Pets have there own slot on the aggro list as well as adding to yours.<br />
<br />
Runes add to your aggro just like healing.<br />

I agree that having no way of reducing our aggro sucks, and all of our spells have high aggro components.  But I doubt that'll ever change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glarnor</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*grin* Ah. SoC *is* a get out of jail free spell. You never mentioned anything about it having to be raid friendly, which it quite obviously isn't. But... continuing to follow your logic, instead of just a general get out of jail free spell, you meant a raid spell that would save you once you have aggro.<br />
<br />
My questions are, then...<br />
How does the pets save the pet classes in that situation?<br />
How much longer will the chanter live with rune on in that situation?<br />
What's the wizards chance of getting concussion off in time?<br />
<br />
Even though with a rune the mob isn't removing damage while hitting them, they can/will still be interrupted, and depending on what raid you are on, when the mobs remove the rune with one hit, it's far from a get out of jail free card. The only two spells that fits what you seem to want are DA type and FD type, imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldoaktree</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is specifically not about get out of jail free.  Evacs are a skill you use to run away from the problem.  The gist of this is meant to be about what happens in a raid situation where you have to stay on but somehow manage your agro.<br />
<br />
Mages are in the same boat as druids, other than having access to spell casting subtlety.  As I understand it, subtlety is a 20% reduction in hate from any spell cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
SoC IS our get out of jail free card, but it was designed when raids were not yet envisioned.  <br />
<br />
And there are very, very few raids that are done outdoors where the spell can be cast anyway.</div></div><hr />

At that point, instead of clicking SoC, just kiss yer tush bye and wait for rez.<br />
<br />
I think Verant just likes the fact that druids have no agro reduction or DA spell, doubt that will change soon...then again, who knows anymore.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  But they (often) let you live long enough that others can get agro back.  They're not true agro manipulation like FD or concussion but they're often effective for at least staying alive.<br />
 <br />
 Runes add to your aggro just like healing.<br />
 <br />
  Haven't tested it but I get the impression rune agro is pretty high.  If I were to guess I'd say heals are HP/2 and runes are straight HP buffed for amount of agro, maybe even HP*2.</div></div><hr />

But chanters cast it on themselves before a mob is engaged.  It adds agro when the mob sees you actually cast it (which anyone who remembers chain runing the MA on certain old fights will probably remember--chanters dirt nap very very fast with that strategy).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Druid root (currently) does enough dmg on a summoning mob to get you summoned.  It is also a high taunt spell.  Instead of getting you out of trouble, it will sink you deeper into it.  Besides, there are very, very few raid level encounters where root is a desireable solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-14-2002, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of those aren't get out of jail free.  And it's all situational.  Rune has a long casting time, causes aggro.   Don't know many chanters that have it up all the time so even if they did, somehow manage to cast it, they'd be dead immediately after it was pounded off 5 seconds later.<br />
<br />
DA is a &quot;get out of jail free sometimes&quot;.  If you're trying to escape, it can be nice.  But the downside is you can't be evac'd.   Also, if you still have aggro after it wears off, and you probably will, you'll still be killed.  My cleric uses DA to sit down and mem gate... usually.  Generally if she's getting to the critical point she's dead anyway when DA wears off.<br />
<br />
Mem blurs are extremely unreliable and you wouldn't use it on a raid.  Doesn't work at all on high level mobs.<br />
<br />
FD classes have it made.  Most meleers are stuck.  Druids can evac/exodus (if the gods will it) and rogues can (if they have the AA) fade into the shadows.  <br />
<br />
You're forgetting what happens to shamans (and enchanters) when slow is resisted.  Ow.<br />
<br />
Rogues don't have weaponshield, that's rangers.  Rogues get a 12 second ability to block frontal attacks called &quot;Nimble&quot;.  But is no good if you're not facing the mobs (i.e. running away).  Evade fails one third of the time, but sometimes you'll get long strings.  I do admit, my rogues survival abilities are pretty darned good these days.<br />
<br />
Druids aren't any worse off than any other class.  I think snare, root and running away is one of the best ways to escape from death, outside of faking it!<br />
<br />
Of the 4 characters I play, rogue and cleric are best at surviving and escaping.  Druid and shaman fall pretty fast.  In my experience, the enchanter rarely survives.</div></div><hr />
