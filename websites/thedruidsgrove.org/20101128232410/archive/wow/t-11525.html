<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">02-02-2007, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So last night I was questing in Zangarmarsh killing ogres, and one of them dropped the Braxxis Staff of Slumber (I think this is what its called.  550 armor, 234 ap in feral forms.  I almost fell out of my chair.  So, finally at lv 64,  my warden staff is getting retired to a bank slot.  With this new staff, I'm at 1200 ap in bear with 17000 armor.  23% crit and 26% dodge.  Insane. <br />
<br />
What does everyone think, should I throw a 25 agi on it, or wait for the Earthwarden?  I'm honored with CE right now, but not sure how hard its gonna be to get to Exalted once I hit 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-02-2007, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going from Honored to Exalted is not an easy task.  From Revered to Exalted it is pretty much running Steamvaults over and over and over ( there's a rep quest + rep from bosses ).<br />
<br />
I got one of those staves too, and I'm holding out for the 35 agi when one of my guildies has it =D<br />
<br />
One thing I miss on the staff though is ANY stam, I tend to drop quite a bit of HP if I go full +AC gear, so I've been mixing AC with HP gear and it's really been working out for me, especially with the mobs/bosses that do beyond melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">02-03-2007, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I use one for tanking, and am holding out for the +35 agi enchant as well, I think it's worth enchanting since I'm still not quite revered with cenarian exp, getting close though.  And yup, I do the same, mix in some sta/resiliance/def gear with it, great tanking combo.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">02-03-2007, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest holding out for +35 agi, as the others have said. It's a nice staff though, granted I haven't bothered buying it yet. It has good AC and good feral attack power, but it's still missing some stats that the Earthwarden has. Though, both could use some stamina, but eh.<br />
<br />
I will agree, it does seem like it's the new Warden Staff... However!<br />
<br />
Look at this (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=59784)... I found out about it this morning, but the first one ever (alliance side, at least) to appear on my server was found today... by a mage. It's on the AH for 4999g (can you guess what he wants to achieve with it?). I immediately messaged the guy and offered 1.3k gold upfront and installation payments, but he turned it down. Oh well, at least he'll notify me when he changes the prices, I got that much. That staff is a beauty.<br />
<br />
Such nice staffs and weapons in BC, eh?</div></div><hr />

It dropped for the first time on Malfurion ( Alliance side ) this weekend, I didn't bother asking a price.  I was too scared and I'm saving cash for my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeamMoo</div><div class="date">02-25-2007, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now either I am really bad at math or that 200 mana redux is really only 140 when you put it on.<br />
<br />
Does it matter if you have natural shapeshifter or not? Maybe the staff reduces for less with that talent? &lt;shrug&gt;<br />
<br />
Bliz I'd like the other 60 mana back please!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heck I haven't even thrown out my Staff of Balzaphon that I got from the Scourge Invasion (naxx release) event. I heard they stopped dropping which is why I kept it =/</div></div><hr />

I made a clean sweep the other day!<br />

I feel like a new druid! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
:eusa_booh <br />
<br />
still carrying around some other stuff i cant bear to diss though.<br />
<br />
and yet to diss an old MC / BWL epix even though a couple have basically been replaced by a blue or even a green !<br />
<br />
at least getting 3 18 slotters recently is helping !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">02-26-2007, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dissed all my tier 1 and 2 stuff and all other random epics I've collected through the years. 26 nexus crystals all in all. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">02-26-2007, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I'm NEVER gonna diss is my Malfurions Bulwark though. It took me like a million runs (and it's like a 25+% dropchance) before I even SAW it drop, so I'm sticking to that even if they make a imba chest of doom with 50000 armor and +55555000 AP.. IM KEEPING MY MALF BULWARK! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's has a wicked droprate. It drops like crazy every run for some guilds.. It NEVER drops for other guilds (I was in the other guild) - but when it finally dropped I went balistic on vent (people was telling me to calm down lol)<br />
<br />
On top of that.. I did 50+ ony runs before I got my tier 2 head.. (saw it drop 3 times.. the 2 first went to resto druids).<br />
<br />
Am I jinxed? :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">03-08-2007, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i was well happy when it dropped.<br />
<br />
never got my SR Cover though....again we had very few drop adn the 3 we did get went to the resto's.<br />
<br />
lost track of how many damn times i did ony. iirc we always used to get mail T2 helms dropping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Finally got my Earthwarden yesterday and had the mats ready to slap 35agi on it. I hate leaving it in my bag so Im even using it for kitty dps. I havent really been pvping much so stamina hasnt been an issue.<br />
<br />
 My next goal is scryers exaulted for the enchants, (60% into revered) and then more farming for enchants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-02-2007, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats!!!<br />
<br />
I'm about halfway through revered with SV.  I get bored running that place back to back, so I've been farming Mech / Botanica / Arcatraz too, as I want to get Exalted with Sha'tar for the ring and enchant recipies.<br />
<br />
Can't wait though for my Earthwarden</div></div><hr />

She's 54 and i got it for just 50g. I know I'll be getting better soon but I feel good for getting it :-)</div></div><hr />
