<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenmarel the Banisher</div><div class="date">07-18-2004, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the spirit of some other posts on this board, I think it's important we try and compile a list of areas where there are wolf form faction issues.  It seems to me that some areas make more since to have negative wolf faction (Halas for the Fuzzy Hat factor).  Where as others make no since for Wolf Form to be KoS (Fironia Vie how can wolves be KoS in a city dedicated to a servant of Tunare?).  So I propose we make a list of Zones, Areas within zones and, particular NPCs that we think SOE should take a look at changing their reaction to wolf form.  <br />
<br />
Besides the 2 above places one big one I can think of is PoS.  All the creatures there are inherently KoS to wolf form and it seems absurd to me.  PoS is partially linked to the Deity Karana.  Animals there should be more excepting of someone in animal shape then otherwise.<br />
<br />
Anyway I hope we can generate a list that Scirroco can eventually use to expand our information on fixing wolf form faction.  Maybe if we can give specific examples to SOE we can get some movement on specific faction issues short of a blanket fix.</div></div><hr />

Wolves should be more welcome in Halas, imho.  If they really wanna keep some annoyance factor they can leave Tundra Jack kos, cause he's a jerk.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you could go either way on that.  I just remember my early days when I first went to Halas to meet a friend who was making a twink on Fennin Ro.  I zoned into Everfrost got lost in the twisting ice canyons.  Ran past this guy named Barjin (I think) who was wearing a Fuzzy Wolf hat.  He proceeded to chase me all the way across EF until I was finally able to lose him near Permafrost after what seemed like 20 mins of running.  All I could think about is the other unlucky druid that was probably perched on his head.</div></div><hr />

Then SOE got a hair up their rears about it and made us kos just about everywhere. Players were so ticked that many just refused to ever use it again. Actually, I seldom use it myself after that. Kind of took the fun out of wearing it.</div></div><hr />

I guess the old cats v. dogs thing is responsible :) I'd like to see that changed though, it's not like they have real wolves up there on the moon to be annoyed at...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xitix</div><div class="date">07-19-2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I remember if a mob didn't have a faction # vs your current form type it defaulted to Beta Neutral and allowed for risk free exploration. Examples were wolf form, Imp, scarecrow and froglok. They need to clean up how they fixed this so it's consistent across all illusions and old data listing some illusions as KoS in some zones that don't make sense removed. <br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
- if mob doesn't have a faction # vs a given form default to using normal player faction <br />
- if it does have a faction # vs it then use that<br />
- remove some faction #'s that don't make sense and thet were put in before the above</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid wolfform is nonKos to both Lfay brownies and the Pirate Town in LoY<br />
(places where you would normally be KOS)<br />
<br />
<br />
chanter nonracial illusions only give you player faction now<br />
<br />
<br />
while I agree that wolf form should not be KoS,<br />
wolf form should also *not* make you nonKoS either<br />
<br />
(at least according to SONY)</div></div><hr />

The Enc Illusion wolf did not make you KOS but the Druid Wolfform did.  At least that was the way it worked for my DE Enchanter since he could go to FV in wolfform but as a Tunare Druid I could not.  I found that out the first time I went there, went to the gate, cast wolfform and got &quot;loading please wait&quot;..  It was a heck of a run back since I had forgotten to bind when I got off the boat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without any inside knowledge of SOE code, it appears that on that black day they simply made wolf form make your faction worse by two cons in every zone with very few exceptions.<br />
<br />
Faction goes:<br />
<br />
ready to attack, threateningly, dubious, apprehensive, indifferent, amicably, kindly, warmly, ally<br />
<br />
It looks like you just drop two places almost everywhere.  There isn't a list of a few zones where your faction got worse.  It was an across the board adjustment of faction in 99% of the zones.<br />
<br />
It was a global change.  So listing individual zones serves no purpose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">07-20-2004, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually on that black day, they just coded Kunark as two factions lowered for WF.  The old zones were coded individual if at all.  They problem is they keep the lowered faction when they added all of the new expansion.  But then they also went alien on us too so the old factions didn't make much sence anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenmarel the Banisher</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well factions pretty much don't have a role at all in EQ anymore.  However the 2 faction chain for sure does not effect FV.  I have max faction with them but, wolf form is still KoS.  The whole faction system itself has serrious issues but, what I was trying to identify here is if there were certain zones we could focus on and work that angle for improvements.  I agree that the ideal solution is to fix wolf form globally but, barring that maybe we can tweak it in a few zones.  Also the more zones we can list where there are issues the more we can establish this as a problem to SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, two I can think of immediately are FV and Kael/Thurg.  Both don't make sence for WF to be KOS.  FV because they are Elves and should be friendly to wolves and Kael/Thurg because Wolves roam there all the time without the giants/Dwarves  bothering them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeyn Kaidyrsi</div><div class="date">07-21-2004, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But if you're an unknown wolf, you're a suspected danger to the pack.  Not only may you not be tolerated, you may be chased off/attacked should you wander too close.<br />
<br />
Being dwarves are suspicious by nature, they would be less tolerant of strange wolves.  Since drakkal wolves are enemies ... is it any wonder Thurg dwarves attack first, then ask questions?<br />
<br />
As for the giants?  They are just insane.  They believe ... kill them all, let the gods sort them out.  So, they'd probably attack a druid in giant form ;)</div></div><hr />

For any reason you can give to justify wolf form being KoS, I can give a reason it shouldn't be.  What you really should ask is: What is fun?  Is it fun to have wolf form KoS all over the place?  Is it an appropriate disadvantage for the abilities it gives us?</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
The only thing I want to add is that there doesn't have to be any disadvantage to something.  Somehow, people always start in that there has to be a disadvantage to an ability to somehow offset it because otherwise the sky would fall and druids would be soloing Lord Mithaniel Marr.<br />
<br />
There are a million advantages to the game that don't have any disadvantages.  Somehow people get the idea that introducing something to the game that is only good for the players is a give away and free lunch and wrong.  If it makes the game more fun and improves the ability of the class there is nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
The only time there should be any disadvantage to an ability is if without the disadvantage that the ability would make the game trivial.  If wolf form made you indifferent faction to every mob in the game then that would be wrong.  But it never has and we are not asking for that.</div></div><hr />

With SOE and/or Mask spells that advantage is no longer necessary.  <br />
<br />
It would be nice if the faction for wolf form would revert to the &quot;good old days,&quot; or at least not be worse than your faction without wolf form.</div></div><hr />
