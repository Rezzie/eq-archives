<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Clakar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could anyone tell me about this zone?<br />
<br />
Just got flagged and noticed some &quot;brids&quot; by the bridge, was going to try and charm and someone in /ooc say not to because they AE silence /shrug?<br />
<br />
Just curious if it is a worthy exp zone or more a just content you have to go through to get your next flag type zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Matafleur Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The birds at zone in do have a short lived ae silence spell. I've only ever exp'd in Torment in a group and it really was terrible exp compared to other zones, (PoS, HoH, PoV).<br />
<br />
That said, it is a nice looking zone with some cool mobs. I've never tried soloing there though, so can't offer any advice on that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalsii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The birds are flagged as animals, but were too high for CoK (haven't tried CoT there). I did some solo here level 61 and 62 the front 3 spawns. The silence is very short range, so if you keep them rooted you're good (I Glamour'd them to make sure root kept). Zone out is very close if you do get in trouble, so it's a decent solo spot for early levels. Once you get to 63, they're just not worth it. They will pull single; their assist radius is smallish. <br />
<br />
Just up the ramp is a spider trap: they don't snare ;(. Just beyond that, there is a koriz hunter wanderer that sees invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Clakar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So really the purpose of this zone was to find a home for Saryn(sp)?<br />
<br />
I'd think the exp bonus or whatnot should be equal or better then BoT, but hey, who am I /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's only a tier 2 zone, BoT is tier 3, why should they have a similar exp mod again? <br />
<br />
Well, besides torment being a pain to be in. (harhar)</div></div><hr />
