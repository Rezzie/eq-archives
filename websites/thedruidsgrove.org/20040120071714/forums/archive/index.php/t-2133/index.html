<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Longfoot Wispwoods</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've started camping for some of the epic tainted/corrupted mobs... a typical Eq time sink. If you've done this, what would you estimate is the average time it's taken you on these sorts of mobs? (I'm excluding, of course, the bigger takedowns like Fay, VS and Black Reavers.)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Average for me was somewhere around 2 hours.  There were some lucky camps where I picked up the epic piece in under half an hour, but those were balanced by 8+ hour ordeals (FU barracuda!)  The epic quest can be a good exercise in moving bind points.  Just bind at your current camp, and leave when you get bored.  Pop in occasionally, and you may get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TinyDru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd estimate the same for me (about 2-3 hours per camp).  Quelm's advice about how to approach the camp should be heeded - bind and pop in from time to time.  Trying to plow through any of these camps, especially one after another, can become more than just a good exercise in moving bind points - it can become EQ hell pretty quickly :) .  The first time (don't ask...) I camped the gobby in Lake Rathe I got his drop within the first 10 minutes.  The second time, it took me about 10 hours...<br />
<br />
Have fun :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>winwell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did most of the camps around 51/52 about 2 years ago, at the time it was good xp, so if you are that young i recommend camping them, then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thandril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can be online directly after a patch its worth running around to spots like LOIO and EJ to see if the epic mobs are up. I got both of those one after the other in the space of 30 mins after one patch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SilleyEskimo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All of mine were under an hour except the gorilla in EJ.  That one was probably about 10-12 hours total, broken up over 3 Saturdays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>malibu1966</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kedge was worst for me. I went on three Seahorse camps for friends before doing it myself. The longest was over 6 hours of completely clearing the Seahorse caves.<br />
<br />
Rather than subject my friends to this, I just went down there from time to time and killed Seahorses till my mana was low then gated out. Port back a half hour later and get close enough to check track. After two weeks of this, the tainted popped on track and I had a 59 Epic Mage help me with Tainted and Corrupt. The Mage pet needed one iCH, but probably could have soloed the Corrupt.<br />
<br />
I was very lucky on the Barracuda and the Gorilla - the Gorilla was about a 30 minute deal. I got the Barracuda while in my low 40's and still hunting the Bloodgills in LIO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KenerG</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lake Rathe took me 2 hours and I am stil after the bloody Cyclops in OOT have 5 hours there other then that under an hour for everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cyclops - up when i got there<br />
Brownie - 5 hours<br />
Seahorse - got it while camping Undertow for a mage friend, got 4 more before we got undertow.<br />
Gorilla - 3 hours<br />
Barracuda - 70 minutes<br />
Mammoth - saw him up when i was exping on IGs<br />
HG - Bard friend's group killed and he had me come loot<br />
Goblin - 8 hours, left camp, get tell 20 min later from a rogue doing bergurgle for cleric bot that real tainted popped and he'll mq it with me when he finished camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kalest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Corrupted mymoth: I actually got that at lvl 29 hunting with a friend. had probably been there an hour or so.<br />
Corrupted Hill Giant: Was farming in RM when this guy poped some 60rogue (before pop) was there killed it and told me I could have (god bless him)<br />
Corrupted Aqua goblin: Went to Lake Rathe one day spent an hour there then went to a raid. Next day I went back got corrupted in under 40mins.<br />
Corrupted Seahorse: Zoned in one night Tainted was up zone was empty. Got some friends from guild there otm took it out. Saw Phinny up killed him too. 1 hour raid.( 1.5 including phinny)<br />
Corrupted brownie got my ranger friend to help me with this part we slaughtered anything brownie. Got tainted then corrupted in about 40mins again.<br />
Corrupted Cyclops: I went to OOT because a friend wanted a port and corrupted was up. She was a necro in guild and solo'ed him for me. 15mins.<br />
Corrupted Gorrila: one of my friends uber guild was killing Sev in EJ and said I should go there and do it that they would help kill it. 50mins cause I had to find the spot.<br />
Corrupted Baracuda: Now this is the funny part. THe first day I camped him I was there for close to 3hours before leaving for work. THe next day I loged in and decided im not leaving till I get my epic piece. One of my friends was mad cause he was neck to neck with me at this spot. 40mins later the Tainted poped I pulled to shore and it spawned the corrupted. I took him out. SInce my friend was still on his way I figured what the hell i'll kill some more. I had litterally bound at the loc the fish spawned at (well out of agro range anyways) and gated there another tainted was up. I pulled him too and he spawned a corrupted. So in about 1 hours time there I got my corrupted and my friends corrupted. So this went relatively fast for me :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BriennaMonk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They vary wildly for everyone I think.<br />
<br />
I spent probably 50 hours camping the Brownie before I finally got him.  Gorilla took me probably 20 hours.<br />
<br />
Giant, Mammoth, Cyclops, Barracuda probably took 10 hours total.<br />
<br />
Aquagoblin I got lucky.  I camped it for 10 hours with no luck.  Then a cleric friend was camping Begurgle and killed the goblin.  He sent me a tell and I gated over and looted it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Reeny TheDruid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">None were too bad maybe an hour or two except the baracuda. That devil just didn't want to spawn for me I think I was there for 10 or 12 hours minimum. Got lucky in Kedge when I zone in I saw two tainted seahorses on tracking so both myself and another druid in my guild got the need piece quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Audo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think concensus has it that's it all just luck. I completed my epic last night (so all the camps were within the last month)..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cyclops -  8 hours +/-  (tried to duo with my warrior, got owned,  looted corpse and kited him for 30 mins until a wizard friend came and just nuked him down)<br />
<br />
Brownie - tainted was up when I got there.. again, owned (no one told me he summoned and the pained unicorn add'd on my warrior)..regrouped and took him down with ease..<br />
<br />
Seahorse - took a full group down to speed up the process.. about 30 minutes (getting to this camp is quite a chore)<br />
<br />
Barracuda - this was the best part for me after hearing the horror stoires ~ 30 minutes, np !<br />
<br />
Mammoth - about an hour<br />
<br />
HG -  My longest camp, totalled 12-14 hours (over 3 days)<br />
<br />
Goblin - about 3 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
It's all random though, I wish you luck =)<br />
<br />
PS. the worst part is waiting for/fighting over the 12 hour respawn of Mr. Codslayer ;=(</div></div><hr />
