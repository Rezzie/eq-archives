<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramia</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, another question about in game maps. I have &quot;downloaded&quot; the zip file of &quot;all maps&quot; from EQ-Toolbox.<br />
<br />
My question is a 2 part question.<br />
<br />
1). Do I put these in my &quot;maps&quot; folder which is in the Sony/EQ folder??<br />
2). How do I pull the maps up once in the zone? Granted since I am a level 65 druid, I have never actully messed around with the new map system since it has been in the game.<br />
<br />
Maybe someone can point out a good site or thread to read how to do this step by step as I really have no clue what I am doing.<br />
<br />
I did notice that my folder &quot;maps&quot; already had maps in it, but it wasn't for every zone. Can I replace those maps with the one from EQ-Toolbox or just add to the folder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to put them under your EverQuest directory in a folder called maps, which should already be there.  And yes, you can replace or overwrite them with the ones from EQ-Toolbox.<br />
<br />
If they're in a zip file, you have to unzip them to that maps directory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramia</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I kinda figured that was where they belong. So if I zone in somewhere and need to see a map of the zone I downloaded, and bring up the map thingy, why doesn't any maps show?<br />
<br />
I guess that I will have to play around with this for a while and see what does and doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help tho.<br />

Also make sure you are in a zone that you actually got a map for. Maps dont work in Ssra or ele planes, or just about any high end plane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">01-27-2004, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, you have to have purchased LoY, otherwise you can only see maps for newbie zones and cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glynna1</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also am in the process of downloading maps which format is best Sony format or showeq format?<br />
<br />
Oh and there is a download all maps and GoD only do both these need to be downloaded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arienne</div><div class="date">02-11-2004, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Download them in the Sony format.  The &quot;all maps&quot; includes GoD maps.<br />
<br />
I have had a hard time with the maps ever since I got LoY.  Seems I could only see them in a certain few zones... and never the ones I needed.  I went to the first GoD zone and found I had no maps there either so I finally decided it was time to fix them... and it took me some time.  First thing I did was the &quot;advanced&quot; file scan and *bleah* ended up downloading over about an hour and a half's worth of music files that I will never use because I keep sounds off.  (I think music files should be an optional download anyway because I connect at 28.8 and they take FOREVER)  Ok.. only thing I downloaded from that was the sound so that probably wasn't the problem anyway.  Logged in... no map.<br />
<br />
So... maybe I need to be sure that the only maps I use are the ones SOE provides for the game.  At least we KNOW those will work... don't we?  Deleted all the maps in my map folder and repatched them when I logged in.  STILL no map.<br />
<br />
The last thing I did was to reinstall the maps from the EQToolbox &quot;all maps&quot; download by extracting them into the &quot;maps&quot; folder of EQ.  Logged in and BINGO!  A MAP!  <br />
<br />
I don't know why SOE maps don't work, but the ones from Toolbox do.  If you have problems still, you might try deleting all the maps in your maps folder and repatching, then extracting the maps from EQToolbox.  I can't say it WILL work, just that it did for me and I still have no idea why!</div></div><hr />
