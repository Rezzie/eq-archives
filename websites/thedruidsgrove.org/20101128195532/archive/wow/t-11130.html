When I first heard we were getting flying form at 68 I thought it was cool because we could get to the new zone a couple levels ahead of everyone else.<br />
<br />
Then someone pointed out once the first few players get there you will have everyone and their brother getting summoned up by locks.  You'll see tons of people up there with no flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

You can now summon someone from azeroth (as of open beta) but certain instances (the ones where u have to fly to get there) will have summoning disabled.</div></div><hr />
