One idea that I had, at least for Priest Classes, would be an ancient buff. With buff slots becoming an issue, even with 21, I think these would really help out.<br />
 <br />
Clerics ===&gt; A symbol buff that does what Blessing of Devotion does as well.<br />
 <br />
Shaman ===&gt; Focus that also does what sense and fortitude does<br />
 <br />
Druid ====&gt; Steeloak that also does what regen does<br />
 <br />
Making these buffs cost the same amount as the primary buff, just having the extra parts would make them truly epic. Would really help shaman out, as well as help downtime and overall buffing frustration.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Considering more (0 dkp) ancient runes have rotted than been looted in my guild i think thats a good idea!<br />
 <br />

As long as they are smart and make them group buffs (single targetting a whole raid would be horrible)</div></div><hr />
