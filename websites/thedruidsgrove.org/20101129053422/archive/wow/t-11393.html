<br />
I've searched everywhere on how to beat warlocks and can't seem to find an answer<br />
<br />
I duel some warlocks and try to beat them but as i get closer to beating them in each succesive duel they decide to quit.<br />
<br />
I would like to believe that blizaard keeps its classes in balance and that anyone with sound enough tactics can beat anybody else with less skill level.<br />
<br />
My question is, How do I beat warlocks?<br />
What will they pull out that I have to look for?<br />
What tricks can I pull out to help me win the battle?<br />
Will stun locking them help?(pounce+feral charge+bash)<br />
Or it better to save my mana for heals?<br />
And lastly, what can I do to heal myself in this battle?<br />
How can beat them in a duel?<br />
<br />
Now, I don't want a stun and run answer, this warlock has to go down and i want to be the victor. i want him to be the one running away when he sees me, not the other way around.<br />
<br />
Its a long complicated set of questions but this is the only I can get a current up to date answer and nothing beats the druids grove for advice.<br />
<br />

Trinket when they fear you the first time, feral charge and bash. Go back to cat get the rest of your combo points for a 5pt rip. Mangle to death, and have a Tidal Charm (http://www.thottbott.com/?i=4714) equipped to ensure victory :) Since 2.0 warlocks just don't beat me one on one, not even with a felguard out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">batoviking</div><div class="date">12-15-2006, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks falloran, that gives me some hope,I haven't dueled a warlock with my mangle yet.<br />
<br />
i've tried getting that trink but everyone is farming it that I haven't been able to get it.<br />
<br />
My best strategy to avoid fear and to get of some unmitigated damage so is this. <br />
<br />
Pounce+Mangle + shift bear+ feral charge + mangle + faerie fire + mangle + bash + Moonfire + shift cat+ mangle + rip + mangle(if possible)...<br />
<br />
so far its hard to pull off but im getting better at it. Im 42/9 feral resto right now. I have points into the talent blood frenzy which is good for building the points I need for a 5 point rip.<br />
<br />
Now, my strategy would only work a warlock with the same gear as me. Also I believe they have a move on their pet to pull them out of this trap. So far it seems mangle is a killer move against casters because you can increase some little bleed effects for extra dmg.<br />
<br />
As far that I have to act according to other stuff they pull out.<br />
Maybe if I obtain that trink I can even use it increase my stun locking abilities get more dmg off.<br />
<br />
BTW falloran, do you have any epic gear? <br />
<br />
Im can fare well against an equally equipped opponent but most warlocks nowadays have epic gear and the tier 2 ones woop the crap out of me.<br />
<br />
One more question, how do you resto druids fare against warlocks. I used to be resto but it bored me so I've stuck to feral. Also wanna know if moonkins can beat warlocks, cuz i've seen a druid get 3.5k starfire crits and and 800 mf crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">12-15-2006, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a mix of pvp gear and some BWL/AQ20/40. I like opening with pounce, mangle, mangle, rip, shift to bear and keep mangle up for the duration of rip, then bash and back to cat. The trinket is awesome against shaman too, as they seem to wait to heal (much like druids). I find them using warstomp and heal when they get low health, so a pvp trinket to break stun and then stunning them with Tidal Charm usually gives me enough time to finish them off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feral, Balance, Resto druids, all easy cake. I'm also Soul Link so whichever pet I need I have at nearly an instant cast and low mana cost. <br />
<br />
I don't tend to fearkite druids either.  Honestly a good warlock should beat a good druid everytime. A good lock won't blow their DC early either no matter what you do to them.<br />
<br />
Hunters, and warriors can own us hard. Some specs of rogues are the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my combo usually goes -&gt; tiger fury+ravange, mangle, rake, rip then go bear, and maul+mangle  (bash when they start casting fear), + feral charge after a fear :)</div></div><hr />

MY question to you is, what could a druid do to give you the hardest time.<br />
I just want to get some good tactics so i dont have to be afraid to go up even against a half dead warlock in the bg's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arestavo</div><div class="date">12-16-2006, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This will not help feral druids out very much, but from a restoration spec and geared (ZG and a little bit of T2) druid I do not find warlocks to be a problem at all 1 on 1.<br />
<br />
I use HoTs to keep myself healed while being feared, and if they have that buff eating pet out I will time my swiftmends (8 second devour cooldown). In case they decide to start draining my mana, I go to bear form and bash them, enrage, and start my frenzied regeneration as they continue to &quot;waste&quot; their mana.<br />
<br />
I also make sure to keep their CoA off me as much as possible, and I do use NS and the rank 11 HT if I drop below 30% early into the fight (first 30 or so seconds).<br />
<br />
I find that I can just outheal their damage output while I hit them with my mace in caster form, so that they quickly run out of mana and resort to lifetapping for more mana. I then just finish them off with a moonfire and a wrath or two.<br />
<br />
Granted, this approach takes 2 to 4 minutes, optimally, but it works for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Restos are acctually best vs locks. At least at hardcore skill and gear level.<br />
<br />
Restos sucks vs more clases and builds than ferals, but vs locks, they are acctuallt better. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greldek</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup resto druids are the tough ones for me. Balance are laughable, and feral are not a problem at all. They are a weak warrior/rogue. I have them try and &quot;stunlock&quot; me all the time.. when rogues do it, I start mashing my my HS button to recoup soon as their their stun breaks, with druids I just wait patiently for the fight to start, once they're done tickling me. <br />
<br />
Balance are stupidly easy, they blow their load way too fast on me hoping to kill me with LOLFIRE spam, and it has never worked if I have full health when the fight starts, for all you balance druids.  I almost feel bad for moonkins who try and pick a fight with me.<br />
<br />
Bad druids let me keep curses on them. Bad druids also don't try to root my pet. You should probably root the felguard or felhunter and try to get away from it. The Felguard does a pretty good job of tearing through druids in all forms but bear, where the dots come in handy.<br />
<br />
I make it a habit to drain a lot of druids. Just because they have so much health and mana to spare, I figure I might as well make sure I stay as full as possible from them for the fight, because usually it's a duration fight.<br />
<br />
I dont' use Deathcoil to fear druids, I use it as a finisher if they are really low and getting ready to SM heal or got a nice big HoT on themselves. I can easily get my fear off even with a cat druid beating on me. It's no problem. No need to blow DC just to fear. <br />
<br />
Immolate is my spell of choice vs druids as well as corruption. I sometimes do shadowbolts, and now that Drain Soul doesn't suck I even use that from time to time. <br />
<br />
For some reason a lot of people seem to think Immolate is like Fireball, Big main hit + small Dot, when it's not. The Dot is what's nice about immolate, the bigish hit at the begining is just a bonus. <br />
<br />
Really well geared feral/resto druids who know how to play the shift heal game well, usually get fearlocked. I try not to fearlock all the time, it's on the same level as stunlock to me. I don't feel good about beating someone who had no chance to react back to my attacks.<br />
<br />
Also never treeform against a good warlock. They may not technically be able to beat tree form (I haven't tried yet), but when you're banished, you are no sort of threat to anyone. And in fact it's in the our best interest to keep you banished for as long as possible if you're in a BG.<br />
<br />
So some hints:<br />
Assume every warlock you fight has a Healthstone ready as well a healing pot. If they are soul link and have a voidwalker, prepare for an nearly instant summon pet of some kind, as well as ~2000pt immunity from all your damage. <br />
<br />
Get our curses off. CoA hurts, but CoShadows, and Tongues can be just as bad for you (or Elements if it's a conflag warlock)<br />
<br />
Use low rank HoT's to waste the felhunters devour, then real heal. <br />
<br />
I don't know if you can shift out of a destrolocks seduce / sb lock, but if you can, do it. If not, you'll be like any other class in that scenario. Dead. Try and get that succy down if with moonfire (very low HP). Well geared Destro locks hurt bad and fast (I always play heavy demon, or affliction, haven't tried destruction yet, so I don't know that playstyle well)<br />
<br />
Root pets, the felguards devour has a bit of range on it, so you'll have to strafe away (and make sure to always strafe, don't waste time by backing up slowly) Some warlocks won't waste the devour on the pets root. Bad ones will have it on auto cast.<br />
<br />
Watch the spell lock from felhunters. If I have my felhunter out, thats what tends to kill druids, is their inability to cast when they want to. <br />
<br />
Imp's fireball used to be mildly annoying. Now with the changes it can hurt bad, especially if they are machine gunned. Just like the succy they have low HP's. Throw a MF or two at it, to get that out of the way.<br />
<br />
TY fir the insight, I also heard shadow deflector( reflects all shadow spells back at caster for 5 seconds) really helps too, i might go into engineering for explosives and stuff but i reeeally want this trink for use against lox and shadow priests<br />
<br />
OFTS but i wish they had a holy spell reflector...<br />
<br />
Good warlocks will absorb most of that with shadow protection, just like good mages do. You learn to watch for people who have that. <br />
<br />
It's not a bad trinket to try, but don't expect it to be your &quot;I win&quot; button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Similar to what has been said, pounce, mangle, rip, shred, moonfire, bear (you will get DC'd because they are about 50% hp at this point) feral charge, bash, go kitty and mangle mangle mangle. If he fears, trinket and unload a finisher on him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I generally agree with the above: if you can, start in cat, and use all your energy to attempt to get them to blow a fear early.  If they do, shift out, rejuv, and then go bear for the remainder of the fight.  Your armor won't count for much, so pop Enrage as soon as you do.  Don't forget to Faerie Fire.  Drain Life brings out the Bash in me, since by that point they're going to be low enough at life that hopefully if a bash lands, I can Maul/Mangle/Maul to win if I have the rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">batoviking</div><div class="date">12-21-2006, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:texla:  TY for all the info you guys, you've really been helpful. I have now seen that I can beat most warlocks at the same gear than me. Some specs I can't touch but thats true for alot of classes. But mostly I can kill them in bg's because they dont have the right pet out. The stunlock really helps and the trinket is the best part. <br />
<br />
Greldek, your info was really helpful, as for the &quot;I win&quot; button, its hard to get that trink and im already herbalism so i guess i wont ever get my hands on it. <br />
<br />
Well, it doesn't close the subject but im satisfied here with all the info i've recieved.<br />
<br />
Droods&gt; jOO</div></div><hr />

If they shift alot and use their entire arsenal the lock is toast. Similar to Lorath, by the time the lock comes out of stun they are 50% and hit me with fear right away...easily trinketed and then bear for the charge and bash game over locky. I dont even notice their pets, I go straight for the throat.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the tip about the Tidal Charm.  Every Druid needs to get this.  Having an interrupt is wonderful even if it is only once every 15 mins.  I use mine constantly.  Very easy to get this trinket just takes some time.</div></div><hr />
