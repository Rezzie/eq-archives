<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">09-21-2007, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New to the boards, but I figured I'd open up by stating that I'm a bit of a crazy Druid who suffers from an obsession with weapons.  I've trained all the weapons so far that are open to Druids, though I'm feral and do spend most of my time in forms, but I'd also like to be a decent fighter in Caster.  Call it an RP whim despite playing on a normal PVP server.<br />
<br />
So anyway, my current favorite weapon is a fist weapon just because I think it looks pretty cool.  The damage isn't great so I just use it really when I'm bored and killing stuff to waste time.<br />
<br />
However, I see a light at the end of the tunnel with some pretty cool looking fist weapons near the higher end levels.  But are they really useful or would I just be better off sticking to a staff or a mace?  To be honest, I'm not really concerned at the moment about anything really with raiding yet or dungeons.  I'm unguilded and currently just sort of camping around at level 29 doing battlegrounds while I wait for my friend to catch up.  <br />
<br />
Have no real plans for the future as I'm pretty new to WoW still.  So I thought I'd get some opinions since I don't see many people using them.</div></div><hr />
