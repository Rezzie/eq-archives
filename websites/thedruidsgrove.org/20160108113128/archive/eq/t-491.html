<br />
For those too lazy to click the link over, the guy reports on Test that there is now a new NPC that you can talk to that will give you a couple of options for rewards for flags<br />
<br />
1) A new Charm item that increases in power the more flags you have. (Exact stats not posted)<br />
<br />
2) XP granted based on number of flags you have attained. (Report of 54% Regular XP in 64 for 3 flags)<br />
<br />
<br />
My selfish reaction to this is to wonder if there will be any reward for those that quested the Alternate entry quests. Those quests resulted in a key to your keyring instead of an actual character flag, so I fear that we will not reap any rewards for doing the quests to gain access to CoD, HoH, Torment or Tactics.</div></div><hr />

Got 6 aa (total, not each) for having valor-storms-hoh-bot-tactics-torment flags.  The stats on the charm are quite nice as well.<br />
<br />
Of course the usual, it's Test and might change :p , but it's more than I expected as-is... pretty happy with it.</div></div><hr />

An excerpt (he had 3 flags I believe): <br />
<br />
My charm was this:<br />
<br />
Intricate Wooden Figurine<br />
Slot: Charm<br />
AC 5<br />
Dex 4<br />
Wis 3<br />
Agi 4<br />
HP 27<br />
Mana 24<br />
ALL RESISTS 3<br />
Wt 0.1<br />
Class: RNG (Its dependant on your class, Rogues charms wont have Mana and have different ammounts etc)<br />
<br />
I asked an elemental flagged ranger (Thank you, Cloudwraite) what his stats were (He had all flags except Time):<br />
<br />
AC 15<br />
Dex 13<br />
Sta 9<br />
Wis 9<br />
Agi 13<br />
HP 81<br />
Mana 72<br />
ALL RESISTS 9<br />
<br />
Im going to take a wild stab at *ALL 10 FLAGS*<br />
(This is just a guess, since there are no Time flagged people on Test)<br />
AC 16 (1.6 per flag)<br />
Dex 15 (1.5 per flag)<br />
Sta 10 (1 per flag)<br />
Wis 10 (1 per flag)<br />
Agi 15 (1.5 per flag)<br />
HP 90 (9 per flag)<br />
Mana 80 (8 per flag)<br />
ALL RESISTS 10 (1 per flag)<br />
<br />
End excerpt<br />
<br />
Given the quality of this charm, I find it *highly* doubtful that you are given both the xp and the charm.  My guess is you will have to choose one or the other (and you would be silly to take the aa, assuming this charm isn't obtainable in any other way).<br />

Hihi, if the reports from test are correct and if this change goes in today's patch and if we can get both charm and xp, I shall finally ding elder. Hooray! (That's a lot of if's, but a girl can dream, can't she?)</div></div><hr />

A decent (90+HP?!?) Charm is a new thing and obviously one would want to flag up before talking to the NPC.

<br />
so you could get the charm as soon as you pass the trials, and then try to work on improving it over time by collecting more flags</div></div><hr />

If the inner acrylia charm maxes out at 100 hp/mana, then it will be alot better than the flag charm for those flagged for time cause of the extra regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
..Unless of course, they had intended to give AA points -OR- a charm, not both.  Then the reward for doing the IA key quest is an upgrade to the flag charm and ~10 AA points (if you do faction work)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like if anything needs to be done it is on the acryllia key.<br />
<br />
And considering the number of times some of us have repeated the same flag fights to do backflagging that is now not needed, I think the both solution is a good reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT, I'm willing to bet that the reason they couldn't implement the flag charm npc yet is because they screwed up.  On test, they saw that it was giving AAs -AND- a charm, and they permakilled it on test and are waiting to fix it to put it on the live servers.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a charm and AAs, but I doubt they'll give both out that way.  Most people will take the charm, because AAs come quickly enough..  but for those of us who have the IA key, we can take the AAs~ which would basically be getting the time we spent on the key back... I guess..</div></div><hr />

Also the patch message says charm AND AA.  Not Or.<br />

<br />
It appears that there are a maximum of 7 (seven) AAs given out, for: trials, BoT, HoH, CoD, Torment, Tactics, SolRo.  The pseudo-flags from quests that give you access to those zones do give AA and charm stats, just as if you had the real flag.  The hedge maze, BoT tower key, factory access in PoI, Aerin'dar key, Temple of Marr access, and other misc things don't seem to count.</div></div><hr />

That's what CHA is for.  :)</div></div><hr />

Even though I can zone into Torment and did the hedge maze thing, it doesn't seem to be giving me credit for it on either the charm or aa. [/quote]<br />
<br />
Did you kill terris Thule or do the Torment quest?  Hedge Maze only gets you to PoNb, so you can go kill Miss Thule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...Everything turned glass by the dragon! That must be a sight, he exclaims. 'Wish I could go there', he sighs.<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Aerin'Dar&lt;/strong&gt; Flag. (sorry I only got half of this SS recorded).<br />
<br />
...Gram shudders as you tell him of the &lt;strong&gt;Crypt of Decay&lt;/strong&gt;. 'A foul place indeed. I would have loved to slay a few of those creatures, though. 'His hand clenches and his eyes look past you. 'Ah, the battles I used to have, he mutters.'<br />
<br />
Gram listens attentively to your story of the &lt;strong&gt;Plane of Torment&lt;/strong&gt;. 'Ravens with bloody eyes,' he muses, 'and creatures with four mouthes?' He shakes his head. 'Never in my day did I see such things.'<br />
<br />
'Animated suits of armor, eh?' Gram says as you tell him of &lt;strong&gt;Halls of Honor&lt;/strong&gt;. 'Saw something like that once, but never so many as that. 'His eyes get a faraway look. 'If only I still had my youth!'<br />
<br />
'Giants and a huge fortress? 'Gram sighs wistfully as you finish your story of the &lt;strong&gt;Bastion of Thunder&lt;/strong&gt;. 'Storming thru a place like that, killing everything in sight - those were good days.'<br />
<br />
The dorf grins excitedly at your description of the Plane of Tactics. 'I'd show the minions of &lt;strong&gt;Rallos Zek&lt;/strong&gt; something, I would! he exclaims, swinging his hands around as though wielding an axe. He sits down again and looks sadly at his aged hands.<br />
<br />
Gram strokes his bread thoughtfully as you tell him of the &lt;strong&gt;Tower of Solusek Ro&lt;/strong&gt;. 'The burning prince himself. A worthy opponent, I'm sure, he says. 'Thank you for the tales, Nimphe. It's good to imagine these places, even if I may never see them.'<br />
<br />
He stopped talking to me at this point, even though I have one (Fennin Ro) of the 4 Elemental Gods.<br />

I got 6aa's on both of my toons (talk about a time saver!) plus some pretty nice charms (so glad I never wasted time in LoY for those worthless things!). <br />
<br />
So, THANK YOU SoE. Whoever came up with this idea, deserves a raise ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.<br />
<br />
Kudos to SOE for making the reward a nice one, and for realizing that it was ok to drop these flags and allow people to exp in these zones.<br />
<br />
Great decisions from my perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xitix</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think it's not normal exp because then people could group and with the group bonus get a lot more exp than was intended. For example 6 people group and doing it for 6*1.8/5= 2.16 AA per 'AA' reward. Or for those without time about 15AA instead of the 7 you get in straight AA now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saraden</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is wishful thinking but if you get a flag after talking to him and talk to him again, I don't suppose he gives you more xp then :)   So if you are going to get some flags soon, I suppose you should wait to go talk to him and get your charm and xp after the flags.  This seems kind of silly though when you look at it this way and thus my wishful thinking about xp by talking to him again after a new flag.  I am going to assume the charm scales up correctly if you get a flag after getting the charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VillinEQ</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think they probablly would flag the account at the current set of flags they have today so thats all you could get for aaxp, but with every new plane u enter you still gain stats on charm.<br />
<br />
Personally while it is a good charm, I think they should have given a bit more on the aaxp side it wasnt 1 roll thru a boss to get a flag some guilds took 100+ ppl thru events and had to do it several times and in one push of a enter key they opened up the zones with imho minimal level restrictions.<br />
<br />
Nothing we can do now guess something is better then nothing as they say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saraden</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just did it with 100% going to regualr xp and it gave me an AA point for each flag instead of going to regular xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remi</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard there was a max of 10 flags being given credit.  As near as I can figure it works out like this.<br />
<br />
I got 6 AA's.<br />
<br />
I'm flagged for:<br />
1. PoV/Pos (trial)<br />
2. Torment (Terris Thule)<br />
3. CoD (Grummus)<br />
4. Tactics (Behemoth)<br />
5. BoT (Askr Quest) <br />
6. Halls of Honor (Aerin Dar)<br />
<br />
So, I'm guessing the missing 4 are: <br />
7. Sol Ro Temple<br />
8. Plane of Fire<br />
9. Planes of earth/air/water<br />
10. Time <br />
<br />
I'm also flagged for Temple of Marr, but it appears no Figurine credit for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilia Gentlepaw</div><div class="date">06-11-2003, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the elemental gods do not count toward the AA's reward.  max AA's you can get is 7; the seven Nimphe listed in her post. if you have access to ele planes the charm will get one step better once you're in time.  at least that's what we've gathered together from my guild.  the flags that count toward the AA exp reward seem only to be some flags the gain you access to new planes.  you don't get a flag when you down an elemental god &quot;just&quot; the time key piece so that makes sense i guess.<br />
<br />
also...you remember when they first told us about this reward?  what did we all do?  &quot;oh i hope it's this or this.&quot;  a common answer was AA points.  that's great we got them.  but then you have folks that have hundreds of AA's that just don't NEED anymore.  so then there was the charm idea.  This charm blows any of the LoY charms I have seen out of the water.   and what did sony do?  they gave us both!  i say excellent job on the reward.  absolutely excellent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elemental gods don't count as they don't give flags, they give items that combine to get you into potime. The first time you zone into potime you get an actual character flag, thats where the last 8hp + other misc increases come from. Oh and 7aa total was reward for having all flags.<br />
<br />
14ac<br />
10sta<br />
10cha<br />
15wis<br />
15agi<br />
80hp<br />
100mana<br />
10sv all. <br />
<br />
Are the final stats, assuming theres no flags in time to get, which is prolly a safe assumption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Me being one of those people who have spent loads of time in LOY without getting a charm yet. While the experience there is only so so. The loot in PP terms is very very nice. There are also some decent upgrades for a 50-60 toon who does not yet have access to  places like VT,NTOV, elemental planes etc etc. <br />
<br />
So time I have spent there and will spend there in the future is hardly wasted.<br />

You are correct.  I didn't realize that PoNb wasn't Torment.  Is that not one of the zones they opened?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Autumn10</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The rewards were good. The charm will actually increase with something I can accomplish instead of something that doesn't even apply to me. I was happy with the compensation but NOT with the exp hit. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeawenette</div><div class="date">06-12-2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's correct.<br />
<br />
PoNb is a raid zone for Terris Thule, nothing more.  There are maybe 30 or so guards to clear before engaging TT, but it's not a zone most people would ever consider exp'ing in.</div></div><hr />
