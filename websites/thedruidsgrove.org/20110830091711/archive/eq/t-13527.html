Any suggestions for good augs to go into that additional slot the cultural gear has?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot of nice Type 7 augs from PoR 1 groupable missions.  Circle of Drakes has 2 nice type  7 augs (small 24-man raid).  Depths of Darkhollow also have a lot of nice type 7 augs.<br />
<br />
Type 12: Bazu or Last Blood augs are the best way to go.  If you are not in a raiding guild I think the only option is to go with DoN bought augs, bic, or an aug which will fit any slot such as the Tipt augs or VP key aug.<br />

Don't see a link to your magelo so I'm shooting all over the place here~</div></div><hr />

I was referring to the type 12 slot.  I don't currently have a magelo but you can look up my stuff on eqplayers.com, as I update that regularly</div></div><hr />

Did they make these somewhat accessible to people who do not raid?  May be something to look into.  I assume you can get 35 and 40% focuses on those stones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know aug stones drop from the Levi Raid in Stoneroot, and General in Undershore, but I don't think I have seem them from sub time level raids.</div></div><hr />
