Its worth it, or its not worth it. I don't mind dueling, but I don't like to lose. You win some, u lose some right? I got over the losing part. I haven't gone to BG yet. 1-How, as a res/bal druid can i increase my chances of winning the duel? From a lot of the forums read and personal experience, it is my understanding that bear form spikes my AC. I am @ level 29, my next IMOTW will be @30. My typical strategy, already buffed and NG on just before i accept the duel, is FF, MF, Rejuv, switch to bear form and slug it out. Somehow, I still lose. 2-Could it just be armor? 3-Is it another characters buffs? Btw, I do not have NS yet. I am directing these questions to dueling anyone from any class. I know that sounds &quot;general&quot;, non-specific, but any guidance or experiences shared are welcomed and appreciated. <br />

Depending on how much health your losing and how fast, you better shift out and heal, and go back in. One good way to try this is:<br />
1.) Bash, shift out, heal, shift in, fight again.<br />
2.) (If you're a Tauren) Shift out, Warstomp, heal, shift in<br />
3.) vs. melee classes only, is to root get a distance away and heal.<br />
<br />
I don't duel much but that's all I know. Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing you might try is putting the HoTs on yourself just as the duel timer starts.  You can get a regrowth and rejuv on to give yourself a pretty nice damage shield that will take you 10-15 seconds into the fight.<br />
<br />
Other than that its hard to give you specifics without more information.</div></div><hr />

And for the record, if you duel another druid be prepared for a long drawn out fight that will go on until one of you goes out of range or gets bored :)</div></div><hr />

I am a NE Druid @ lvl32 right now. NS is sweeeeeeeet =) I used it today for the first time and man it rocks.  Thank u GWMORT for a great start to my battle, Trixtaa for giving me new ideas in bear form and melee class beginings, and DaE for lettin me know not to waste my time, unless I was bored, hehe. 1-Any recomendations on dueling the classes that can daze u like Warriors and Paly's? I can root most, but every now and then some classes get lucky and resist u. 2-Against hunters or warlocks, should i even bother with their pet/minion? It has been said that Warlocks and Hunters are our worst enemies. 3-What is our best defense/offense against these classes? I thought of rooting the pet and attacking the caster direct. 4-Is FF even worth using in a duel?<br />

As for the pets personally I hibernate them so I can have my root to hold the hunter in place to prevent them from kiting me and I attack them in their dead zone. This zone is where you are far enough away to melee but to close for them to shoot at you. This allows you to nuke at your leisure. Rehiberante pet as needed. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">05-25-2006, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah hunters aren't bad at all, generally sleep/root/ignore the pet and focus on the player.<br />
<br />
warlocks own me so I can't give you much advice there, I assume cat is the best approach, but I am not feral and lack real kitty power.<br />
<br />
Easiest for me as a moonkin are the melee classes (warrior/rogue/paladin), their attacks don't hurt much through my armor and their armor doesn't protect them from my nukes, good times.  As for dealing with the stuns, the best advice is just to take it and deal.  For a rogue, try to get the HoTs on you and drop bear before his attack, wait for him to blow all his cooldowns and then take it to him, the stuns won't be too bad after that particularly if you keep him out of stealth with MF, FF.  Depending on your level the best anti rogue gear is GWA (Green Whelp Armor), the rogue will fall asleep during that initial barrage while you stand there in bear, then shift out and heal and start the fight over wth all his cooldowns blown, game over.</div></div><hr />

Thank u Swear as I now fear no hunter. FF will remain in my bag of tricks against our enemies. I will put their pets to sleep. Hopefully by the time they wake up the beating their master took will be over, lol. *Sense a little over confidence?* Two things come to minds with Hunters. 1-Does Scare beast ability force me to fight the battle as a caster? 2-Even with eliminating the pet thru hibernate, what other tool does a hunter have in this &quot;Dead Zone?&quot; As for Warlocks, if u can't beat them join them? It is my understanding that rogues do there best damage under stealth. MF has been one of my favorite spells for its Dot from the begining. 3-How does the rogue fall asleep during the initial barrage? 4-Does this happen because he has exhausted all his abilities? Thank you guyz again for your guidance for us newbs 2 WoW.<br />

<br />
Any damage taken wakes them up, but it is pretty great to have the fall asleep so you can shift, heal and get back to beating on them.<br />

If the warlock or shadow priest know how to play, just run.  Run away quickly.</div></div><hr />

To answer some of your questions scare beast I believe will fear you if you are in cat or bear. As far as the dead zone I do not believe the hunters have any tools to hit you with besides their pet. possibly one of their special abilities, but I can not say for sure can anyone confirm plz?</div></div><hr />

It is a leatherworker crafted item, I don't know where you get the recipe.  The sleep lasts 15 seconds not 5 (was 30 before the last patch).  The last patch also nerfed it so it doesn't effect anything over level 50, but from level 30-50 it completely owns.  The 5% chance seems tiny, but it is per hit and rogues hit a lot, especially in the initial volley.  The trick is not to attack until he is asleep, so you don't wake him.<br />
<br />
It is also incredible because it is a defensive proc it still works in feral forms.  If nothing else you should be able to find it in the AH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trefenwyd</div><div class="date">05-25-2006, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice.......:clap:  I feel like this huge empty fish tank and you guyz just keep pouring all this knowledge into it. Thank You...:) I'll check to see if I already have the recipe or the AH. I think my leatherworking is only up to 185 right now. I will have to check with my trainer on that skill. This crafted item, is it just one piece or is it part of a set of 5? Its nice to know it works in feral forms like NGrasp so you don't have to slow down. Why are Warlocks/Shadow Priests so dominant? Do they silence us? Is there any weakness that we can rise up to? Any advice on how to knock down a Paladin and his buffs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balzinn</div><div class="date">05-25-2006, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way I deal with Paladins is to make a key that cycles through Rank *1* MF/FF/IS/Root and try to trick them into cooking off all their mana ceansing.<br />
<br />
A hunter can scatter shot and disorient you while you're in their deadzone.  It's a 30S cooldown and only lasts about 5s, so depending on how good their timing is they may get a chance to shoot you up or they may stand there watching you wander around while rooted.  Really the only time a hunter should beat a druid is by getting lucky with improved Conc shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">05-25-2006, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">locks and priests are frustrating because of the fears and Mind control etc... that don't let you get down to business shredding them.  Instead you run around aimlessly taking tons of shadow damage, it bites.<br />
<br />
Outside of a duel situation, if you can catch one while you are stealthed in cat and can get some quick combos on them, you have a fighting chance.<br />
<br />
Paladins don't give me much trouble, but I'm a moonkin.  I use the same trick to get them to cleanse the low rank debuffs off wasting their mana.  Dueling a paladin is all about endurance.  Just hang in there until they are low on mana and tear into them with everything you got.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS the GWA is not part of a set</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trefenwyd</div><div class="date">05-25-2006, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, nice trick on the paly's.:)  Are the paly's that paranoid about all the debuffs? Is it overwhelming? If I go against an experienced paladin, should I root him first? than FF/MF? I think rooting someone creates extra pressure and haste mistakes. Do they have any spell casting abilities/debuffs against us?<br />
<br />
As for Hunters, I thought the dead zone was where you were far enough to melee but too close for them to shoot at you?<br />
<br />
As for Clothies, I'll leave them alone:shuffle: <br />

Thank you again for your guidance and wisdom. I will be using a lot of this @ BG.<br />
