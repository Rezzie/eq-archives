<br />
And great to talk to you online last night :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all gone through!  Found myself stood in thunder bluff wondering why I'd deliberately gone from being a svelte, Nelf druid into a huge bloody great cow and if I'd rolled a female tauren I'd at least be able to see past the shoulders and oh my, the tail's going from left to right, right to left, left to right. Left, to Right, right, to left...zzzzzzz<br />
<br />
And then I discovered that /moo does indeed make me moo and everything was good again.<br />
<br />
And then it took me about a week to get to dalaran. In my defence it's hard work when you don't know what the flightpoints look like or where they are. I had to circuit the place in Borean Tundra 2-3 times then I gave up and flew up to fizzlecrank's airstrip, got flagged PvP and chased all over the place before I finally found a flight point to Dalaran (thank god all those do appear to have carried over too).<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe brilliant Nell.<br />
<br />
i'll see you online later then our newest female tauren druid :)  And then i can throw you an invite and we can start doing some heroics etc with our new healer :)<br />
<br />
so it was much quicker than they had indicated to you last nite.....<br />
<br />
do they transfer everything else across.....all gear has become the horde equivalent ? all items in your bank ? all your rep standings ? etc etc<br />
<br />
Is your char called Nellie ?<br />
<br />
indeed /moo rocks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Male this time.  All my ally chars are female on the basis that if you're going to look at something's arse for several hours at a time it might as well be female. As a tauren though? A cow's arse is a cow's arse however you look at it. :D<br />
<br />
TehNellie (bit wierd changing the name of the char too, been Nothernellie for years, tehnellie is the hunter) is char's name :eek: <br />
<br />
Heroics? I had a look at the guild gear level and I reckon we should be going for the 8 man or less achievements :D<br />
<br />
With regards to the transfer it was pretty painless the realm transfer took a couple of hours, the faction transfer was done in minutes. All your Rep transfers across, exactly to where depends on the race your transfer from and to I think but if you're exalted with Darnassus you become exalted with Thunder Bluff.  Think you lose anything on the AH and theres a 20k gold limit on a level 80. Worst part is that it's character by character as I'd love to have my bank alt, DE alt and the hunter for that matter available to use but it's too expensive to move en masse.<br />
<br />
All your flight points transfer over too so you aren't stranded with nothing when you arrive.<br />
<br />
Achievement whores watch out, think it strips you of your achievements although I did get the equivalent Horde to the bear mount (kill all the NPC leaders in the cities?) when I logged back in, everything else, looking at the armoury is gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok will catch up to inv u later on....<br />
<br />
20k limit ! that sucks if you have cash !<br />
<br />
yeah we got a good 10 man start a few weeks with people keen.  then for no apparent reason it all stopped and we struggled for signups.<br />
<br />
couple people been ill recently but also a couple saying getting fed up of wow and 1 or 2 mentioned Aion ?  Our MT is not around much atm (fed up with wow) but we do have a couple others luckily who can do the job.<br />
<br />
we just need to get back into the swing of actually getting people to commit to a raid and be there.<br />
<br />
i want to do Ony. I want my Antlers !<br />
<br />
We did part 1 of 10 man Naax on 8 man a few weeks back. And i believe they did 8 man OS10, either no or 1D, maybe both.<br />
<br />
Atm getting EoT's has been interesting people for multiple daily runs for various mains and alts.  And Toc H still gives some people a gear upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I'd like to settle in and get to know people a bit, but more than happy to help out on that front if you like. Got a vent server we can use if needed and don't mind trying to sort out a forum page if people want it.<br />
<br />
Been the time of year when hard to get people into raids, especially as small casual guild. Once the weather turns rubbish and dark again people tend to be more inclined to commit a couple of hours to running a raid :)<br />
<br />
Only tried Ony once in a pug and despite 30k DPS we never got her down so want my revenge on her too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah no probelm.<br />
<br />
hopefully you'll be up for some heroics with us to get to know us.<br />
<br />
are you dual spec and if so were u also an oomkin ?<br />
<br />
hopefully we will get some raids in as oct progresses. have to say i gave up putting stuff in the calendar so see if anyone else does....<br />
<br />
forum page/s could be good...although it can be difficult to get people to read them i've found in the past....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am Dual spec, still hootkin on the alt spec. vendored all the tank/feral DPS gear a few days back so would need a major gearing excercise to go off hootkin but don't mind doing it if there's a gap on that front.</div></div><hr />

It is very very wierd at the moment, changing race and gender. I'm not sure Iactually like being a cow yet, but there's enough different druid forms to take my mind off it.<br />
<br />
MoooOOOOOoooooOO!</div></div><hr />

Don't think for a second Des hasn't been considering the delectable sounding server/faction Xfer.  Skwid has me nearly sold on the idea...except...I &lt;3 my guildies......<br />
<br />
I &lt;3 my guildies and they don't want to be hordelings =*(<br />

<br />
And I think it'd be an easier move if the guild wasn't as fun as it is.  Suffice to say there's a LOT of personality in our guild and I &lt;3 that.  Never a dull moment.  As far as overall faction maturity level- it leaves a little to be desired...We'll see though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of weeks ago I'd have agreed with you Des. Unfortunately a few things changed. I won't bore you with the details but I forced the issue and after a week of simmering unpleasantness decided to call it a day. I didn't want to stay on the same realm and figured what Khel had described on here sounded like what I was looking for, I've enjoyed chewing the cud(sorry, I'll stop with the cow themed jokes) over all things Druid so dropped over to say hello and sound out the possibility of a new home.<br />
<br />
Still at work at the moment, but will try and manage a flying visit around 8ish, otherwise probably on all night tomorrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to be the way things go, in the wonderful world of WoW, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Had faction Xfers been available during the fallout with my previous guild, I'd have jumped on it w/o missing a beat.  They weren't, and rather than abandon the friends I've made on server...husband convinced me to stay and just start over with a new guild family.  So far, so good.  There are a few bumps in the road here and there, but nothing I can't mangle into submission so far.  *knocks on wood*<br />
<br />
I definitely understand the move =)  I'd just miss my Dramatanian friends...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-01-2009, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah good to have you with us Nell.<br />

you can always move if stuff goes wrong in the future Des.</div></div><hr />

from the little tree on the Des' other shoulder...  &quot;Don't forget about Turalyon....  you wouldn't have to be a cow....&quot;<br />
:beerchug: <br />
<br />
In all honesty though, I miss my tauren druids.  If I didn't have so much invested in Rhus, I'd play them more.  <br />
My first toon was a Tauren Druid on Ysera, where he still sits to this very day gathering dust and telling stories to the calves about the good old days.  Y'know, when it was uphill both ways to Thunderbluff, and always snowing...</div></div><hr />

It wasn't until around level 55 that I started my little warrior.  I didn't fall in love with the class though, and went back to druiding.  <br />
<br />
I haven't forgotten about you Raging, and should things continue as they did last night- a server xfer might become a more realistic choice for this little bear. =)</div></div><hr />

I think it might cause some additional issues for me in my beloved Dramatan. XD lol<br />
<br />
Actually, I may post it.  As frustrating as the situation was, I was loling about it all night long =)  Let me finish up a few things here and I'll start writing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think my tauren druid (Lolkodo, if you were wondering her name)...is going to end up being a side project.  My guild has decided that they want to try and progress through more content...that means endless heroic grinds to get gear/emblems for those that are interested and trying to coordinate it so it doesn't end like it did last weekend.</div></div><hr />
