<br />
Healing Adept - For sure, very important; Healing gift, because it doesn't hit on our mini ch spells, is less important<br />
<br />
Combat Agility - the people around here who used to run numbers said that avoiding getting hit was WAY more useful to druids than mitigating hits.  (Combat stability reduces the amount you're hit for... as I understand it, reduces the number of maximum hits, rather than reducing by a fixed percentage or something.  Druids mitigate like a really soggy tissue.  I wouldn't bother with CS until you'd exhausted lots of other AA.)<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Wood - this is nice sometimes when dealing with a couple adds, to help you a bit.  <br />
<br />
Channeling Focus - Are you getting hit and stunned a lot?  If so, then the occasional casting through might be helpful.<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Wild - I've never met anyone who thought this was really worth the AA compared to so many other things.  Maybe it's just that there are so many other choices that seem better?  The damage seems really unlikely to make a dent in any mob a 63 druid is fighting.</div></div><hr />

healing gift is nice down the line but a) it's situational b) it's not 100% reliable... can't really compare that to an aa that is constantly on and is the only thing to raise the hp our ch's heal for.</div></div><hr />

HA will work on a CH; HG will not.<br />
<br />
HG gives you a chance to crit; HA always makes your heals worth more- 28% more, with maxed HA, AHA, and HAM. You don't always need clutch heals, but making your heals more efficient always is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">08-18-2005, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess it really depends on how often you use percentage heal vs. fast heals. <br />
 <br />
Suppose you use percentage heal 10% vs. fast heals 90% on a total healed hit point bases. Also suppose you have a focus item of +25% fast heal (boon of pious). This focus does not effect percentage heals. The average increase in fast heal from focus is 13%, half of the max focus effect.<br />
 <br />
If you get healing adept 3, your increase in fast heal is from 113% to 123% of base heal. that is only (123-113)/113=8.85% increase. (BTW If you have a uber 50% +heal focus this percentage will drop further to 8%). Your increase in percentage heal is 10%. So the average increase is about 9% based on 90%/10% ratio of using.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand, if you get healing gift 3, you increase fast heal by 10% while there is no increase in percentage heal. The average is also 9%. <br />
 <br />
Carry out this calculation further, we find that putting HA3+HG3 is better than HA3+AHA3. I'll not get into details here. So generally speaking, if you use fast heals often (I guess after level 68 at least some people will), then get HA3+HG3 instead of HA3+AHA3 is probably better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In theory HA3+HG3 seems better than AHA3 however this is only true if each crit landed for the full amount. You are just as likely to crit when topping up a caster's health as when a MT is at 10% and about to die.<br />
<br />
Casting Chlorotrope with HA3 + HG3 + boon of pious means you heal for 3.5k (average) and can crit for up to 7.6k (10% chance of this). <br />
<br />
Now imagine you have a 10k MT :-<br />
<br />
To get the most from HG you would need to land the heal when the MT has 24% health and hope that it crits. If there is no crit then the MT is at 60% health and you probably need to chain another heal.<br />
<br />
If you aim to land a heal when the MT is at 50% health then you can expect to heal him back up to around 85%. If you get a crit then a large amount of this is wasted as he is back at full health.  <br />
<br />
The advantage of HA is that its a fixed increase to every heal and you are not depending on luck. It's not flashy but it is dependable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the best general mana preservation focus, Ancient Clorobon beats Karana's Renewal in efficiency (Heal per Mana) by 7.5%.<br />
<br />
If you are lucky enough to own a CoA BP, Anc.Chlorobon is 17.5% more efficient than KR.<br />
<br />
If you have some mid level foci (15% mana pres, 30% heal focus) chlorotrope will not be worse than 13% less efficient than KR.<br />
<br />
While you cast that 10 second heal you can't meditate. (not even on a horse) This is up to 7.75 secs more than the cast time of Chloro that you won't be medding on, so about one meditation tick wasted per cast. This eats up some (~5-6%) of the efficiency advantage that KR might have. (or make it fall further behind)<br />

(Max heal AAs assumed for the numbers)</div></div><hr />

This is only true if you received the full benefit of your foci.<br />
<br />
The CoA BP can save up to 25% of the mana cost and Dragon Health can increase the amount healed by up to 50%. So on average I would guess that Anc. Chlorobon is about 10% less efficient but it it can be more efficient if you are lucky with the RNG.<br />
<br />
Your figures do however show how close we are to bypassing KR and I wonder how our healing will look like in the next expansion or 2.</div></div><hr />

Over time there's no such thing as being lucky with RNG. With max healing gift 22% of the heals will crit and it makes up a significant part of the average amount healed. (going from 11.9% less efficient to 7.5% more efficient, or 11.13 hpm vs 13.58 hpm)</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the correct AAs, KR will heal 5990 for 475 mana = 12.6 hp/mana Efficiency<br />
 <br />
Ancient Chloroborn would heal for an average of 4765 (28% from AAs and an average of 26% from Dragon Health) and would cost an average of 477 mana (21% from spec/SCM and average of 13% from CoA BP) = 10.0 Efficiency<br />
<br />
Taking Crit heals into account, the average heal would be 5813 healed (22% chance of a crit) = 12.2 Efficiency. Whoops I didn't take Crits into account.<br />
<br />
Let me know where our figures disagree as I'd be interested in seeing how out of date KR is.</div></div><hr />

The average from the heal focus should be 25.5%, not 26%. My error is the assumption that mana pres is fixed and not random. This is a far bigger mistake so I guess you win :) .  (I'm going to go ahead and blame Madrone for this since we've talked so much spell mechanics and he never set me straight!    oh... and I'm going to blame all the board readers here since I posted my excel thing that calculates all my numbers, but nobody checked it out or posted any feedback. So there!  :p  )<br />
<br />
Anyway..  new numbers works out as 5794 / 477 = 12.14 hpm, a bit behind KR.<br />
<br />
We can't have that so I'm going to resort to the case where you can meditate when not casting (either sit right away after cast or sit on a horse). The assumtion here is that you won't meditate on a horse while casting (or meleeing) - I hope that is correct. So, by factoring in lost meditation for casting KR (roughly 1 tick) we can think of this as KR being 30 mana more expensive, or AC 30 mana less expensive. This fuzzy math yields a relative efficiency close to 5794 / (477-30) = 12.9 hpm vs 12.6 for KR, or 5990 / (474+30) = 11.8 for KR vs 12.1 for AC. The cast ratio isn't 1:1 since AC heals a bit less, but the lost time is a bit more than a tick.<br />
<br />
So..  I maintain my conclusion that KR is pointless. The mana gain when not medding is too little to justify an extra spell memmed and the 10 second cast time. (7 secs lost is a lost nuke!)    :)</div></div><hr />

It is not correct.  You do regen mana while sitting on a horse casting.  If your UI displays percentages, you can see the number increase while casting a spell with a long cast time.<br />
<br />
Just to be sure, I just tested it by casting Karana's Renewal while mounted on a horse, my mana bar went from 86% to 87% during the cast.<br />
<br />
While meleeing on a horse, you lose the regen.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
My order would be:<br />
 <br />
Healing Adept<br />
Spirit of the Wood<br />
Combat Agility<br />
Combat Stability<br />
Channeling Focus<br />
Wrath of the Wild<br />
 <br />
But I seriously would get many other AAs before the last 2 listed.  I didn't get CF until I had over 500 AAs, and I didn't get WotW until I had over 1000 AAs.  If you are a hardcore soloer, they would be more valuable to you, but if you group/raid much then there are others that are better.<br />
