When I play it's usually me (2box druid/enchanter) with my RL sweets (2box ranger/cleric) so it's not all that hard to round out the group with either another 2boxing guildy or 2 other guild-family members. More often than not...we just go do the adv with just the 4 of us (druid/enchanter &amp; ranger/cleric).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">03-20-2004, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That other thread really made me reflect on the things that make me nuts.  Fortunately, haven't had one of those &quot;nazi's&quot; yet, but....<br />
<br />
I have a now 63 shaman (wuwu!), a 52 SK, a 37 druid and a wizard 35 as of last nite.  Yes, my shaman tries to grab kei before an adventure, because the preliminary buffing is brutal (don't have group focus yet, or group boar) and if the group is impatient, I do NOTHING but canni for the whole adventure.  I don't go out of my way for any other buffs.<br />
<br />
But lately been on the wizard a lot...it's a lazy thing.  Just...nuke.  And I cannot believe how many people in their mid-30s are completely dysfunctional without buffs out the wazoo.  Would I like clarity?  Yeah, but I don't look for it.  I manage my mana without, and do it well.  (In fact, I find clarity to be a tease, it doesn't last long enough anyway).  Any buffs a group member wants to throw on me, I'll take gladly, but I ask for nothing beyond sow.<br />
<br />
Yet over the past few days, groups have been taking forever.  Everyone has to run off and find temperance.  And clarity.  And HoS.  Omg we really need an enchy.  We can't go, no one can paci.  It's a slaughter 60 but let's only handle single pulls!  The tanks have to compare every piece of gear, every hit point, archery skill, throwing skill...<br />
<br />
These dungeons aren't that hard at mid-30's, certainly not for the experience you rake in.<br />
<br />
Holy moly, just get in there PULL SOMETHING AND KILL IT!!!!<br />
<br />
I mean, this is supposed to be fun, right?  :p</div></div><hr />

The only time I find level 30ish LDoN's a challenge is when I occasionally 3 box one and then it's only a challenge to my 3 box skills not to my characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">05-21-2004, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny I should see this post again.  My wizard (now 50....yay!) was with a group.  Good thing we had 2 clerics, one was level 46 and had a FULLY BUFFED wisdom of 134.  Ok, perhaps no one introduced her to the game, and she just didn't know to get that stat as close to max as possible.  <br />
<br />
But all she did was complain.  Complain she didn't have kei.  Complain that we were still pulling when she was 20m (well...after every pull, of course, never mind the 2nd cleric).  Complain that we were going too slow (we were but she kept begging for med breaks).<br />
<br />
And yet I've seen her in PoK every night pushing temp.</div></div><hr />

The only tank of any sort we had was our really awsome Pally.  So, we check the LFG window and picked up a War.  He got there, didn't say too much, but enough so that it was semi friendly.  We got to the zone-in ... he said &quot;crap, brb&quot; and poof he was gone.  I had not heard of this before, and my guildies filled me in.  I immediatly did a /feedback to voice my opinion of how wrong this is and a /report of the person in question in the hopes that they might consider at least taking his points away.  We were pretty worried that we'd lose without the tankage, but turns out we won...bittersweet considering we all really wanted to make him have a loss, too.</div></div><hr />

So far I have been lucky to not have seen this happen.  But if my group was take the loss from not having a full rounded group, what does a loss in LDON adventures do anyway?  Is there some type of penalty ppl receive from having losses in LDON's?</div></div><hr />
