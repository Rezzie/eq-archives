<br />
now that i have everything that i can possibly get from season 2 and 3 and 4 for my feral gear (that's everything that deosn't have a rating requirement) im starting to build my resto PvP set... yes, i'll be living in BG's for the next month or so... anywhoo, here's my question:<br />
<br />
im probably going to get the cape from badge rewards... should i get the one with spell critical strike rating, or the one with haste rating?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravnia</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend Kharmaa's Shroud of Hope (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=33333) and put spell penetration enchant on it.</div></div><hr />

  I was about to post the same question, but phrased slightly differently.   Here are the tradeoffs between Kharmaa's Shroud of hope or the Cloak of Swift reprieve.   Both are 60 badge PvP cloaks. <br />
<br />
Kharmaa's Shroud of Hope <br />
Equip: Restores 6 mana per 5 sec <br />
<br />
Cloak of Swift Reprieve <br />
Equip: Improves spell haste rating by 16 (1.0%). <br />
<br />
There is a similar tradeoff with 2 neck pieces:<br />
13 STA and 7 Mana per 5 sec<br />
vs. <br />
26 spell haste<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there other threads comparing the value of spell haste out there, with good explanations on why people picked them, because I can't find them.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I spent my honor on the things that needed upgrading the most, and it amazes me how quickly i can burn through 70K honor...<br />
<br />
I don't even have any PvP set bonuses yet since i spent my honor on the Guardian's Kodohide belt, Vindicators's Kodohide Bracers, Vindicator's Kodohide belt, and Merciless Gladiator's Kodohide Helm... I have ~140 resilience atm and my +healing is ~1,200... what kind of +healing do you guys have for your PvP set? should i even attempt arena at this point?</div></div><hr />

Two belts? <br />

Sure, go ahead and do 10 games.  Don't expect to get up to 2k rating your first week, but if you can find a decent warrior / warlock to pair up with you can do just fine.  Remember to play a lot more defensivley, staying as far away as possible, as if you get caught by a S4 warrior or S4 rogue, you're gonna be hurtin.<br />
 <br />
No harm in getting points tho, even if you lose a few :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, not sure how it'll go at this point... i've teamed up with a rogue and my feral gear is pretty good, we just to learn to play together better... i think i'll continue feral for a bit and get more arena points for the moment... i have about 2,100 currently<br />
<br />
i'd MUCh rather go bargain basement on the resto gear, to get my rating decent enough to buy some more gear for my feral spec... i just love dishin out the pain...<br />
<br />
we went up against a spriest/lock combo last week and it was just NASTY... those dots are digusting :(</div></div><hr />
