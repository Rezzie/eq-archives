<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">05-12-2007, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In prep for Beta (which should open in the next month or two), which AA would you like to see upgraded?<br />
<br />
At present assuming the PH AA in Lucy are correct, we have:<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Grove upgrade<br />
Gathering of Spirits upgrade<br />
Icefall Bear Upgrade<br />
White Wolf Upgrade<br />
Nature's Gift<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people don't care for White Wolf, but presently the way it's coded in Lucy, the AA stops working totally on any spell over level 75.  We need it to be upgraded for it to remain useful, or we need to have it's cap increased, which I don't think is likely.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the upgrade to Icebear A:  Be White, and B maybe be a pack of bears instead of just one.<br />
<br />
The Grove and GoS upgrades are a given.<br />
<br />
I also expect Nature's Gift to be a given since I am betting the other two priests get theirs upgraded, wanted or not.<br />
<br />
I also expect to see GoRM stop working on anything over 75.<br />
<br />
I expect to see an upgrade to Radiant Cascade<br />
<br />
I would not mind seeing a Detrimental verison of White Wolf - such as Spirit of the Black Wolf, or something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laurelleii</div><div class="date">05-12-2007, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love an AA that gave us at least one more bear, and cured our poor bears identity crisis :lol: <br />
<br />
A &quot;black wolf&quot; to go along with white wolf for detremental spells would be great.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I expect about the same things as listed above.<br />
<br />
One AA I always wished we had shared with wizards was the teleport group to your bind spot one. Is it Teleport Bind? I honestly don't know the exact name of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amped</div><div class="date">05-12-2007, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would also like to see the teleport to bind, regardless of whether it shows up as  a spell or as an aa.<br />
<br />
Would like to see a contiunation of aas that allow us to gain more mana based on wisdom going above cap or maybe just straight mana gain, kind of like natural durability does for hps. Would help those that can't get the great gear.<br />
<br />
Would like to see a fixed duration, low resist root AA. Takes away a spell slot and makes for viable CC. Possibly a snare aa as well, again low resist, fixed duration.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I expect to see much of the same, just upgrades to what we already have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aura of the Storm, Cost 6/8/10<br />
Re-use: 45 minutes<br />
Duration: 5 minutes<br />
Effects: Increase the damage of casters groups spells and procs. Each level raises the % of improved damage by 3-5%.<br />
<br />
Aura of the Serene, Cost 6/8/10<br />
Re-use: 45 minutes<br />
Duration: 5 minutes<br />
Effects: Increase the healing of your group members spells + procs. Each level raises the % of improved healing by 3-5%.<br />
<br />
Having this line of aa's would allow future AA lines to include: Increasing the percents, and reducing the recasts.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Also like to see Ferocity added (would also require us to gain the double attack skill) again wouldn't unbalance anything and would provide a minor dps boost for those of us that like to melee.<br />
 <br />
Upgrade to wrath of the wild.<br />

Further reduction in cast time to RC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AAs that make charm breaks less likely.  They brought animals back; it's consistent with prior class abilities.  Why not make this more useful?<br />
<br />
AAs that have a chance to make an animal neutral rather than hostile after charm break.<br />
<br />
Spell or AA to heal pets.<br />
<br />
Redesign the Ward AA to be a song (short term buffer window) rather than a totem that no one uses because it fouls up targeting.<br />
<br />
Root and/or snare AAs would be nifty, as would a rune AA.<br />
<br />
An AA that allows us faster nuke casting, balanced with longer refresh (e.g. the spell gem stays grayed out for 8 seconds, but you can cast in 3 seconds - enough to allow you to nuke between heals)</div></div><hr />

The effect already goes to the song window and the ward isn't targetable with my cycle NPC key nor my f8 key.  I am not sure what you're asking for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since the new Dot-Nuke, I would ask for DoT AAs (length and chance).<br />
<br />
AA to reduce cast time of the Druid Rezz<br />
AA to improve 2nd live (better than do it via spell?)<br />
AA to improve worn FT (little use with new OOC regen, but helps)<br />
<br />
In adition to the booboo pet line, I wouldn't mind A &quot;treant&quot; pet-swarm line. At the end of the day an AA dot.<br />
<br />
AA to reduce nuke/dot/heal agro (three lines)<br />
<br />
AA to increase HP/MANA/AC/Resists<br />

AA to reduce MGB re-cast.<br />

What ever they do loads of AAs!!!</div></div><hr />

Putting together the new NBW spell, assume it is going to become a line (surely!) and the upcoming changes to DoT hate...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oakenguard should definately be moved to an aa and the spell line should be scrapped.   Both the aa on the old spells timer if need be that spell would be so much more practical as an aa.<br />
<br />
One idea for an aa I had would be a grp ability (or maybe a short term aura like the circle of xxx style effects?) that focused rain spells.   Be via dmg or crit rate.  I really like the idea of rain spells but think they get overlooked at times... it'd be cool to be able to help them spike in dmg for a short time every so often (15 to 26mins or so?) to help casters spike dps up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rajolae</div><div class="date">06-01-2007, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im saddened by the fact that they are going to waste an AA on &quot;upgrading&quot; White Wolf instead of changing the current max level on it. The AA is nigh of useless with its duration and unless the &quot;upgraded&quot; one has a longer duration the same will be true for it.<br />
<br />
As for Go*M, GoRM needs to be changed to 80, period. It was bull**** that we needed to go to GoRM so quickly and now we are needing to do it again. Also, the entire line needs to be made to degrade 10%/level or something, the way its set up now it wreaks havoc on people who used older spells with newer spells (EG: Moonshadow and Pure Life, with ACB/Trope you could cast Moonshadow and get a GoM proc and then cast one of those, can't do that with this set up making new spells a burden).<br />
<br />
Healing Adept direly needs to be upgraded (and double the ranks of whatever the Healing Gift upgrade gets to make up for lost AAs in the line), especially so if it ends up being true that focus effects are no longer going to be going up in percentages, which I hope to Zeus isn't true.<br />
<br />
As for another Nature's Boon upgrade, for the love of god they need to stop the line. The AA was worthless in GoD and every other expansion thats upgraded the sorry AA. Unless the new one is going to miraculously heal for several hundred HP/tick it will still be worthless. Group regen got cut for a reason, i see no reason for this AA line to ever be continued unless they change the way they have upgraded regen based spells for the past ever.<br />
<br />
I hope that for once they manage to give us some class unique AAs that aren't trash this time around and especially do not include the word &quot;root.&quot;<br />
<br />
All classes should get at least another spell gem with this expansion, preferably two. I really want to see the Direwild Guard upgrade I assume we will be getting turned into an AA much like shamans have a version of it as an AA (no deaggro proc, but it is also instant cast and does not tie up a spell gem).</div></div><hr />

With TSS and the new stuff it pushed off on casters, especially us, we deserved to have gotten one but did not. Honestly I think it is time for EQ to go the way of the other MMORPGs and follow the WoW model and just let us make hotkeys for spells. The idea of &quot;memorizing&quot; spells has always been dumb, but now it is a major hinderance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sparked from the mana regen debates on the spell thread, it seems like there could be an AA solution. Or an AA that could be part of the solution anyway.<br />
<br />
Any nuke or heal over lv70 that lands as a critical, could return some amount of mana. Or some idea similar to that anyway, so we're not asking for all of our mana regen issues to be solved by jumping Mask from 5/tick to 50/tick.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Something like that would interfere with Go*M and AH, Go*M would need to be bumped up by 1% or AH lowered by 1% with something like that being placed at AH's value. Personally Id rather have something like that instead and AH refunded, but we all remember how long it took them to refund AH when it was screwing GoM up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Discanthir</div><div class="date">06-06-2007, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oaken guard and fernspur lines into AAs has been said a lot, but it's a great idea.<br />
 <br />
I would like to see an instant cast fire resist debuff AA. Possibly cold. Not an ac/attack debuff (though that would be nice). I wrote elsewhere, in grind groups fighting mobs that resist a lot we don't have time to cast hand of ro and a nuke before the mob is dead, or under 10%. In harder zones with good grind groups the debuff still usually keeps us from landing that extra nuke before the mob is too low in health to be worth it, and it would save me a needed spell slot. I would love to be able to hit that on incoming and cast away. A long recast timer on this one would make it kind of moot, though.<br />
 <br />
I think mana regen added to our ward would be a nifty idea. It would make it not so useless.<br />
 <br />
Some way to get mana back fast. Nature's Harvest or something. Currently we are the only caster class without that. Clerics have yaulp, shaman's have canni, wizards have harvest, chanters have gather mana, mages have hurt sticks, and I forget the necro one (unless it is lich?).<br />
 <br />
We very, very, very much need more healing adept AAs.<br />
 <br />
One that lowers reuse timer of SotG and GoS. It's been said, but good enough to be repeated. Anyone think of possibly adding cure counters to either line? That would be a very nice switch out for the DS portion and help to address druids falling behind in cures a little. An AA that further lowers the radiant cure timer would be nice as well. <br />
 <br />
Increase DoT duration is a great idea, as is one to make an animal not aggro when charm breaks, or have a good chance to not aggro.<br />
 <br />
I've always wanted a self exodus. Back when we got secondary recall (sp?) I got it because I thought it was a self exodus to a second bind. Must be on a separate timer from group, otherwise it would have no point at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will help on our debuff (especially on short terms ones such as Vines/IB/Blistering Sunray) and helpful for those druids that do DoT for DPS. Keep it so affects only spells that are higher than 3 ticks so won't work on NBW.</div></div><hr />

lol, the white wolf aa helps alot in the long run. During Lethar 2 fight, i have found my mana lasts twice as long if i use it at the beginning, and again towards the end of the fight.

I think we're better off fighting for Lunarlight and Adrenaline Surge to be improved.  If Adrenaline Surge were near instant cast, we could use that in many of the situations where a cleric would use divarb.</div></div><hr />

We already have decent general purpose spot heals, but a very fast casting inefficient heal would be helpful in many situations.  I think that was the intent behind Adrenaline Surge, but there really isn't much difference between a 2.3 sec cast time heal (Ancient Chlorobon) and a 1.8 sec cast time heal (Adrenaline Surge).</div></div><hr />

BoS's recast type is worse than AS's due to the fact that it greys out all of a paladin's spell gems while cycling through its recast timer, no way anything like that would fly for us.</div></div><hr />
