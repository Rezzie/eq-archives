<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to start a thread to discuss three of our healing spells. My strategy thus far is to mainly use Healing Touch because it is more mana efficient than the other two main healing spells. I use Rejuvenation when the amount needed to be healed is very low (I finish a fight down only ~25% health, or someone in my group took only a few hits). I find I rarely use Regrowth.<br />
<br />
The only benefit to using Regrowth over Healing Touch is the lower cast time (currently 2s vs. 3.5s); the mana cost of Regrowth and Healing Touch remain pretty much the same. I don't see myself using Regrowth that much in the future, but I wanted to get some input to see if I was missing some benefit.<br />
<br />
As far as Talents go, I'm planning to do ~31 in Restoration and 20 in Balance. I am only planning to spend 4 points in either of Improved Rejuvenation or Improved Regrowth. I'm finding it difficult to decide between the two becuase of the mechanics of Improved Regrowth. How do I know what a 10% increase in the chance to crit with Regrowth will buy me in the end for average amount healed per cast? Is it 10% + the base chance to crit (which is?) or 1.1* the base chance to crit (not as much of a benefit). At least with Improved Rejuvenation, you know exactly what you're getting (+3% healed per point invested).<br />
<br />
I could split my points between the two; however, given that I rarely use Regrowth, I think I'll invest my points in Improved Rejuvenation. Comments?</div></div><hr />

It would only make sense that a heal over time should cost significantly less mana than an insta-heal....Guess there's really no point in using Regrowth now when soloing, unless I want to use my heal earlier and get the full effect during a fight. <br />
<br />
When grouping, I do use Regrowth/Rejuvenation a lot, as it draws considerably less aggro than Healing Touch. I also use Rejuvenation on myself constantly, whether it's to top off my HPs at the end of a fight, or to start off a fight, especially right before I switch to bear/cat. Based on that I would personally go for Improved Rejuv over Improved Regrowth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find myself using Regrowth more often now.  When soloing in bear form I use to fight till around 25% health and switch to caster form to land a timely Healing Touch for best mana efficiency.  Somewhere after level 35, this stopped working well.  Got constantly more stunned and I noticed an increase in mobs performing special high damage attacks like Execute at low health.<br />
<br />
Now I fight to about 50% health, switch to caster form cast regrowth/rejuvenation back to bear form and I usually end up at 50% health and full mana when I switch back to caster form.  With Improved Regrowth Rank3, I average about 1/4 Regrowths lands as a critical.  Pretty much it's a Healing Touch with a rejuvination padding.  <br />
<br />
For groups, especially in Scarlet Monastery and Stormguarde I follow those same lines.  Rather then wait for the Tank to go down to 30% for best mana effiency I usually spot a Regrowth at 50%.  A(n) untimely add(s) simply can make that 30% health drop in less then 3 seconds.  Of course Nature's Swiftness is great for that sort of thing, but I'd rather save that for true unavoidable emergencies. (Like when I'm going to die from heal aggro).<br />
<br />
From a grouping standpoint, when you need to heal, you need to heal.  That additional 15% on Rejuvination isn't going to save someone from death.  A critted Regrowth more often times, will.<br />

<br />
I find i only use healing touch when someone is down a LOT of HP and has a high probability of living through the casting time of healing touch.<br />
<br />
I'm not usually the main healer though, and i'm entirely feral specc'd at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have found the insta HoT to pull little aggro if you can manage to use it carefully.  I can even cast it very early in the fight on the main tank without drawing aggro.  One tic-tac is to cast the insta HoT BEFORE your tank pulls so the ticks are going off as s/he takes those first few hits.  Getting both those HoTs going on the main tank can really make a difference.</div></div><hr />

I also got casting subsiety 5, havn't had much of a Healing Touch agro problem in groups since.</div></div><hr />

In groups I will use regrowth to buy a bit of time before a Healing Touch.  Rejuvinate I use when soloing and I just want a little heal before the next mob and in groups when someones down enough that I doubt they will regen it before the next mob but not down enough that I think their injury warrants the big mana cost of Healing Touch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instant cast while moving, and often enough HoT to keep my butt alive til the bad guys get bored and wander off.  Also useful when running across continents and not bothering to avoid hostiles while doing so; just look up from your pizza and drop a rejuve on yourself every time you hear something gnawing on your leg...<br />

This is how I use these spells and it seems very efficient to me.  Before i take on a mob usually lvl 53-54...I like challenging kills and more xp per kill..I buff up with mark and thorns..I pull with moonfire ..slap on fairie fire...slap on these 2 regens go bearform...usually my mark of chosen trinket procs also...once in bear form I use demorilizing roar...I can usually make it through the fight am half health afterwards...once i go back to caster form im fm...throw on regrowth ...rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boudicca</div><div class="date">01-12-2005, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are many instances (Mauradon and Uldaman come to mind) where there's constant need for AE spells.  Mages and Warlocks (Warlocks especially, because their AE hurts them as well as the mobs) lose a lot of health over a relatively short period of time during the 5-10 seconds of AEing.  The main tank will also lose health when he AE taunts or if there is a boss mob to tank while the minions are AEd.  This is where Regrowth &gt; Healing Touch for me.<br />
<br />
Right before the AE pull, slap Regrowths on the AEers; that way you can have a little bit of a cushion to watch the tank's health + any sudden dips in health from the casters.  From there, you should have plenty of time to cast a Healing Touch depending on who is getting beat on most.  Granted, you'll use up some MP, but the casters will also be spent after AE pulls so you will have time to recover it.</div></div><hr />

Improved Healing Touch reduces the mana cost on Healing Touch so that it costs less mana to cast than Regrowth. It is not very hard to time a Healing Touch spell to land on your tank when you are the main healer for a group. I have never used Regrowth to main heal for a group and I've never had a problem with landing my heals using the longer cast (more efficient) Healing Touch. Since I hardly use Regrowth even while soloing, I have decided not to put any talent points into Improved Regrowth. I am more often than not, the main healer for my groups, and Healing Touch has always worked the best for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyll</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a new druid but I've done the math. With Improved Regrowth (50% chance to crit) it's a much better heal when used regularly. It's not good for spaming on the same target because it loses some effect if you don't let the regen portion work.<br />
<br />
The math I did showed a couple things. First, Regrowth heals pretty much the same as Healing touch, but half up front and half in regen. A crit doubles the heal. So a crit regrowth is basically a healing touch with a 21 sec regen attached. With a 50% chance to do that I will use it as a first heal ALL the time.<br />
<br />
With Improved Healing Touch, Improved Regrowth, and Gift of Nature...<br />
<br />
Regrowth heals 2345.7 avg (full duration) for 880 mana. That's 2.67 hps/mana.<br />
Crit Regrowth heals 3348 avg for the same 880 mana. 3.80 hps/mana.<br />
<br />
Assuming you crit half the time the average effeciency of Regrowth will be 3.17 hps/mana.<br />
<br />
Average heal for Healing Touch is 2060 for 687 mana. Or 3.00 hps/mana.<br />
<br />
Although my math on that last may be off... to take 15% off do you divide by 1.15 or multiply by 0.85? In the second case the effectiveness would still only be 3.07.<br />
<br />
So based on these figures I plan to use regrowth as a first heal on the tank and followup with healing touch. If anyone else takes aggro they are getting a regrowth.<br />
<br />
Incidently, improved rejuv only puts it's effeciency at 2.84 hps/mana. Not bad for a patch heal when you can't spare the casting time.<br />
<br />
Once I get improved regrowth maxed I plan on getting the one hit wonder addon and have it check for regrowth first and if it's not on the target then cast it but if it is cast healing touch. That should keep my effeciency at it's peak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">01-31-2005, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing a lot of instance raiding lately; since I don't pvp it's about the only thing to do post 60.  And I'll say that my previous healing system has been revamped alot.  I use regrowth much more often now since damage is done quickly and I need to get that buffer heal on.<br />
<br />
The two main healing scenarios I come across:<br />
<br />
1) I have an aoe mage in my group, in which case I'm sweating due to the cast times.  Using both regens on the mage gives me a little bit of play room, not much but a little.  I generally use natures swiftness to flash heal everytime it's available.  But I do a 3 heal chain: rejuv with first damage, followed immediatly by regrowth and then healing touch if the fight is still going on. Anyone else in the group getting damage during an aoe fight will get a regrowth popped on them if possible and any hunter pet getting damage is probably going to die because I don't have the time to target the pet to heal them if I'm keeping the mage alive.<br />
<br />
2) Healing main tank or off tank is much easier I'm generally casting moonfire, faerie fire, wrath and starfire in addition to healing the tank.  Only on boss fights is my healing taxed and then I use the same 3 heal chain as I do on mages, rejuv, regrowth, healing touch.  I hold out the flash heals for those odd damage spikes or for fights like the beast in UBRS when everyone is being feared out of reach and I have to run find the tank to heal them.  <br />
<br />
I only use tranquility in fights where there's a single mob that is aoeing or at the end of the fight when everyone is hurting.  Tranquility draws too much agro if there are multiple mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shark</div><div class="date">02-01-2005, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, for targeting hunter pets, you can toggle the hunter hotkey and it will switch to the pet. For example, if the hunter is the 2nd member of the group, then you can quick-target him by hitting F3. If you want to target his pet, simply hit F3 twice.</div></div><hr />

Crits on spells are only +50%, my math put Regroth at slightly below HT.</div></div><hr />
