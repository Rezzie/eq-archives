Everything went fine.  I zoned into Natimbi, triggered the event, spawned the Reborns and Conduit and we began the killing.  Only thing was, the Juggernaut didn't spawn.<br />
<br />
Anyone else ever hear of this happening or did I miss a step somewhere?  We /bugged it in case it's messed up.  According to my checklist I haven't missed anything up to this point.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't tell from your post how many you killed, but normally clearing all the ones on the platform with the Conduit is enough to cause the change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a timed event, the Conduit only stays active a certain length of time, then despawns.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I could think of that I might have messed up was the crystal turn in.  But I know that I did it but just in case I went back to Abysmal and did it again.  Hoping I'd get the &quot;I have no need for this item&quot; message but the NPC took it, gave me the quest text and the crystal was back in my inventory.  Will have to wait till we try the NJ again to see if that was in fact the problem.</div></div><hr />

Zoned in, approached platform, reborns and ritual conduit spawned.  We killed all the reborns and the Juggernaut did not spawn.  <br />
<br />
I heard that you need the waterlogged collection bag which I destroyed for need of inventory space.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone advise?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Namira1</div><div class="date">01-13-2007, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have the bowl and the contents I have collected up to this point on my toon.  Fenier you mentioned it is a timed event... we killed the reborns in a matter of a few minutes, if that long... could we have not waited long enough for the despawn and spawn of the juggernaut?<br />
<br />
edit: that's right, turned in the bag... whew, it's taken so long to come to this point I've forgotten all the steps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Took us less ten 5 minutes to kill the reborns, but we made sure to kill *all* of the reborns also.<br />
<br />
There are some on his platform, and 4 down at the base of the duel ramps.<br />
