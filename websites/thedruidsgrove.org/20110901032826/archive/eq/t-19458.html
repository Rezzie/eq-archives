<br />
Can anyone tell me what it is called, if it does exist? And didn't these armor sets come out with Kunark, or am I wrong about that too?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated</div></div><hr />

Kunark had level 50ish class sets, can't remember the Druid class name.  But I remember that the legs dropped from VS in KC, the BP dropped from Trak in OS, and there were arms that cast a free DoT.<br />
<br />
LOL the things you remember after 7 or 8 years!<br />

But no, what I am talking about is low level stat generating gear... the equipment aforementioned is like +4 dex +1 cha, along those lines</div></div><hr />

Kunark as mentioned had the Elder Spiritist armors.  Mostly, it was better to use whatever +wisdom items you can find until you went planar, Velious quest,  Mischief quest, or Elysian. Later, they added armor sets in The Serpent's Spine, as well as ornate quest in Planes of Power.<br />

  Heh, people used to make fun of me because, I would have golden boots(efreeti), plate wrists(runed mithril), at times I would run crystal chitin arms, I think the platinum arms in solc had a plate look if I remember right(oddly enough, I never could get hold of the crystal chitin bp and legs, whether I camped them or not).  Not even mentioning the other various bits and pieces of gear I had scrounged up from all over for my armor sets, like runed circlets, gator legs, whatever the permafrost cloak was from a goblin with wisdom on it, various enchanted jewelry. It was funny with the chain look of elysian people would ask what is a ranger doing with a shield and where did you get that sword with all the leaves coming out of it. Given my name also, they also thought I was a Pally at times.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that was the first part of my reply.  They were from the old world, and there wasn't any for druids :(<br />
<br />
I forget what they were all named, but most classes had one.<br />

<br />
Crystal Chitin Chestguard, Crystal Chitin Sleeves, Crystal Chitin Gauntlets, Runed Mithril Bracer/Chitin bracer, Efreeti Boots, and Crystal Legs made you look like a BOSS with some Golden Boots.  It was awesome.<br />
<br />
I never could find a plate graphic helmet I could wear, however, much to my dismay :(  Wood elves always had to coolest plate hat graphics<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, Tat :)</div></div><hr />

Try the Earth Blessed armor series in Twilight Sea, statwise and quest wise that will be what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />
