<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iz1988</div><div class="date">03-06-2008, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all! Just joined the community recently and i've been pretty impressed by the enthusiasm of the peeps and helpful advice provided! I know this questions has sort of been asked before, but i'm going to approach it from a different angle, so don't :twak: me so soon... :)<br />
<br />
I'm currently a level 66 feral druid. Been feral all my druidic life except for a brief period around level 52 when i respecced for resto just for the heck of it with full equips and all. It was pretty fun, but life had to go on and i respecced back to feral. Fast forward 18 levels, my final aim is to be a instance/raid main healer (and the only resto druid) for my guild. That's some background, here's my problem-<br />
<br />
I intend to do so only after i'm more or less ready to stop soloing, which for me, means after obtaining my epic flight form! However I'd like to seek your opinion on -WHEN i should start to fully convert to resto spec (there's no turning back from there!) -HOW i should obtain the equipment necessary so that i can actually do a decent job :D -Any useful advice i should know, coz i'm likely to have to do OTJ (on-the-job) training :wiggle: :mage01: <br />
<br />
Oh as a side note, i tried mainhealing recently for normal blood furnace when i was 64 with heaing/caster gear, and it was quite a terrible failure. true the 3 times we wiped they pulled 2-3 groups at the same time due to bad co-ordination, but i still felt quite demoralized after that... :(<br />
<br />
Any advice would be deeply appreciated. :) CHEERS SIBLINGS OF CENARIUS!</div></div><hr />

take quest-gear from BEM, NS, SM and run instances for the gear from there.<br />
at 70 try to run heroics for gear.<br />
and at about 700-900+ heal u can explore kara-healing.<br />
in kara your gear will quite make a boost so dont worry.<br />
<br />
when to respec?<br />
i would suggest u respecc when u have a starter-healing gear.<br />
u need practice in healing when entering kara or you will have problems keeping ppl up over longer fights (getting used to mana-management).</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true.  <br />
<br />
Assuming you will start running Kara with a group new to Kara, you will probably - at first - be having to heal the entire party until your tank (and party) gets the hang of it (and each other).  <br />
<br />
Therefore, I recommend you work on your Mana Regen (MP5), however you can.<br />
<br />
Once you start getting your good Kara drops, don't forget your enchants.  Not gonna lie, it's gonna get expensive, so try to save your gold, shards, and motes of whatever whenever you can.  <br />
<br />
And, keep in mind, that there is a great healing enchant in Honor Hold (are you alliance?) obtainable with a Revered or higher rep.  It's worth the Hellfire grinding.</div></div><hr />

Yes i'mi on alliance &lt;3 soft cuddly kittys. <br />
<br />
i have actually been gathering a little collection of healing gear from quest rewards. Helped to off-heal terrok twice yesterday including all the bosses prior to that, tgt with a shadow priest. there's a problem with keeping me alive ain't it, coz i keep dying! haha... :confused: but then he had the AoE Shadow Bolt thing that kept hitting me, but i couldn't heal the tank AND myself enough to mitigate the dmg...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">03-08-2008, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find soloing as a resto druid really isn't that bad.  I use roots and dots and cyclone any add in my way.  I can heal myself if I get smushed.  <br />
<br />
I took a feral/resto hybrid spec for awhile but realized that healing in level 70 dungeons I needed to go full resto.  I was also balance/resto for awhile too.  I think that worked nicely.  Now I'm mostly resto with a bit in balance for PVP and soloing.  Seems to work nicely.  <br />
<br />
I do miss being feral.  I have a really nice set of feral gear should I ever get the chance to go back to that.  In fact, I almost want to roll another druid just so I can play both!  Still, I love being resto too.</div></div><hr />

According to Resto4Life (http://www.resto4life.com/2008/03/07/its-arbor-day-in-azeroth/)  the 2.4 patch gives a good boost to Regrowth.  Making it the choice for tree form instant big heals (via swiftmend).</div></div><hr />

im raid-healing SSC/TK(both clear but still gathering gear for MH/BT for a 40 ppl-pool). there is only one talent that would be boost my healing. This would be &quot;Empowered Touch&quot; for the instant HT on the tank. but a 6k HT is enough.<br />
if u cant keep the tank up with your HoTs then u shouldnt solo-heal the tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  You acquire the mats (ingredients) for the particular Enchant that you need and then you find an enchanter who is able to do that enchant on your gear.  If there isn't anyone in your guild who can do it, then you could find one easily enough over the trade or general channel.  Usually guildies don't charge for enchanting items, but strangers might....perhaps a tip would be required.<br />
<br />
However, I'm not sure about the enchant from Honor Hold Rep.  I believe you can just apply that yourself.  I'd love to tell you for certain, but, I was a goof and simply flew through Hellfire Penninsula in my quest to finally hit 70, with no regard whatsoever for my rep.  YES - I regret it now.<br />
<br />
Is kara a possibility for a NORMAL player? I seriously can't imagine 10 person raids. XD barely been on a heroic!<br />
<br />
Ya.  That's what I thought.  I joined a casual guild, because I didn't want any pressure about my build, gear, stats - anything.  I just wanted to play the game.  Then, next thing I know, my &quot;casual&quot; guild is farming Kara and Gruul, and just about to start ZA.  <br />
<br />
I'd of never thunk it, but, I'm loving every minute of it. :wink:</div></div><hr />

So yea, i've been collecting some healing gear, but I'm still not very confident in my ability to Mainheal yet...<br />
<br />
do you think i shud do heroic setthek halls (for epic flight form!!) as feral or in resto? and if in resto, what should my gear be like? since heroic SH is pretty much my short term end game aim :D thanks all!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
U get the head-enchant from honor hold when u are revered and can apply it yourself on your head-item (its like the armor-kits)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">03-11-2008, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you are tank in heroic setthek u wont be able to place the hots on the statues so either u have a second druid with you or you are going for the healing and statue-hoting.<br />
<br />
Bingo.  <br />
<br />
Iz, I'm not sure what your guild is like, but hopefully they will be glad to help you out with your flight form and perhaps somebody will know another Druid willing to help out with the HoT's.  Because, you really will need 2 druids for the Set Halls run.  <br />
<br />
As for which role you play, it will honestly depend on your talent build at the time, and your preference of play.  Tanking and Healing are pretty much the two key aspects of the game, and they depend on each other for eventual success,  so as a druid, you are fortunate enough to be able to do both.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I was in full healing epics before I even attempted heroics.  But, to be honest, I don't run a lot of dungeons....so I just happened to be already geared anyway.  And, to this day, depending on the group I'm with, it can be either really, really fun....or just plain crappy. <br />
<br />
But, I'm pretty sure that's the way it's supposed to be, otherwise, this would be one very boring game. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

sounds like a plan huh. and yea, i saw the revered enchantment from Honor Hold... darn that's a lot more hellfire instances to run! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats why there are so many guides about reputation gaining.<br />
With my druid i made the mistake to do all the quests of a fraction straight away.<br />
With my mage(currently lvl 65) im much smarter. <br />
Before i did the hellfire-quests i entered ramparts a few times for the reputation.(cause ramparts and bloodfurnace only give rep till honored)<br />
Same thing with cenarion expidition. Did the quest with the plant parts till honored (u need about 380 of them O.o -&gt; glad my main is herbalism :biggrin: )<br />
That way u gain rep to revered with the quests only.</div></div><hr />

Just respecced to resto yesterday!! healed my first instance- Auchenai Crypts (which i'd never suceeded in compelted as a feral before!) and it was a blast! My guild leader said i did great :)<br />
Now it's just an issue of farming for gear and (Eventually, if ever...) going on heroic sethekk halls for epic flight form!!<br />
what stats do you suggest i get (+healing, spirit, int) before attempting the instance of my life? :beerchug:</div></div><hr />

That casting time debuff that the boss has makes pallies and shamans almost worthless, and severley hurts priests.  Insta Heals go!<br />
<br />
Get as much +healing as you can.  Especially for 5 mans, you will have plenty of time to sit and drink between pulls if you have to.  Raid healing tends to have longer fights, which is where mana regen will really shine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iz1988</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye! That's what i'm starting to realize. In heroics even, sometimes mana regen is necessary to keep up for the longer boss fights. Don't see myself lasting more than 5 minutes for a boss fight!<br />
Fortuntaely or unfortunately my guild is starting on karazhan the day after, and I'll be one of the healers and only resto druid. We'll see how my mana regen holds out :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found it easier to have high mana availability in KZ than in Heroics.  In heroic's its pretty much you vs. the world.  In KZ, the druid should be keeping rolling lifebloom on both tanks and Rejuvenations.  The secondary and teriary healer should be handling the spot heals on the tanks and the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd start with that.  Plus, you will inevitably start getting drops that will combine +Healing with + MP5 and extra goodies thrown in there.  <br />
<br />
Any extra stats you might want can be aquired through enchants.....although....I honestly didn't start enchanting any of my gear until I was darned certain I was going to be wearing it a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK - I've somehow missed reading the 3 posts ahead of my last....<br />
<br />
I cannot lie, I've had mana issues with KZ as well.  However, only in the beginning when &quot;breaking in&quot; a new group.<br />
<br />
I've always found that the more experience a KZ group gets along the better gear they aquire, the boss fights get much shorter resulting in less heals required.  Mana problem solved.<br />
<br />
I never have a mana issue in 25 Man's.  Sometimes if things are a little &quot;glitchy&quot;, Potions and Innervates do the trick.</div></div><hr />

And if you are a herbalist, having the tons of Primal Lifes from herbing will help a bit:<br />
<br />
+81 healing to weapon - Enchant<br />
+35 healing to gloves - Enchant<br />
+46 healing +15 sta to pants - Spellthread (tailoring)<br />
<br />
Total Mats:  6x Greater Planar 14 x Large Prismatic 19x Primal Life 8x Primal Water<br />
<br />
Thats an extra 162 healing for between 200 and 250g, which is like 3 days worth of sunwell dailies.  <br />
<br />
Even if you have blue pants, you should probably get the spell thread, as it only costs 5 primal lifes, which are cheap.  Also, see if you can find an enchanter that is lvling enchanting to enchant +6mp5 to your chest for free.  Its really cheap, and used to skill up a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iz1988</div><div class="date">05-01-2008, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for all your help. I'm now a resto druid sitting on about 1534 +healing unbuffed. Can top the healing charts in every Kara run my guild's in (at one point i was responsible for 51% of the heals), which gives you an idea of how powerful druid healing can be. at that time i only had +1300 healing, so now shud be more imba XD<br />
<br />
Still hopefully this thread can be a good starting point for aspiring druid healers.</div></div><hr />
