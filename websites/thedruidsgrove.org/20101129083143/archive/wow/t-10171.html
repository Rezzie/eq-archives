<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-01-2006, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so last night a few guild members and I decide to run through Mara and see &quot;how far we could get&quot; on only our second try.<br />
<br />
We went in via the orange entrance and moved along quite well.  I hate those blobs that move really slow but drop HUGE damage.  The slug spitting poop chute was a PITA as well, but stealth up to it and beat it down and no more poison slugs.<br />
<br />
A 57 Pally, a 50 warrior, a 52 feral druid ( me ), 1 51 resto druid and a 44 mage ( he stood WAY back ).<br />
<br />
We got to the princess with very few problems ( the mage died once b/c of those poison maggot things ), but that run of good luck ended very quickly.<br />
<br />
The warrior, myself and the pally went to tank while the mage dropped bombs.  Then the first fear hit, we were still ok.  I used my Corp charm to dispel the fear and went back to tanking.  Another fear before the cool down and the princess went after the healer and mage.  We were able to regain aggro, but she was now out on the thin strip leading to her platform.  <br />
<br />
This is where it went bad in a hurry.  With a few waves of pain ( farts or just ground stomps I'm not sure ), me and the healer were thrown off the ledge and into the water where a hydra quickly ate us.  The mage was squished in about 2 hits and the warrior and pally were then quickly dispatched.  <br />
<br />
So we obviously had a flaw in keeping her on the platform.  Our next plan of attack is as follows:<br />
- 2 tanks keep her on the platform with the healer, off tank and caster are out of fear distance<br />
<br />
- when the first fear hits, the 3rd tank goes in to keep her on her platform ( which will probably be me ) and the pally backs out to assist healing while the warrior and I tank<br />
<br />
- next fear hits and we swap, me going back to assist heal and the pally tanking with the warrior.<br />
<br />
Anyone see holes in this plan?  This should keep her on her platform and avoid anyone flying off the edges.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">03-01-2006, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, kill a few turtles in the water and fight with your back to the wall.  The wall is located straight ahead, past the princess, after you've killed the giants.  Melee about where the turtle was.  It should be far enough to keep everyone against the wall out of fart range but not much further than that.<br />
<br />
The 'fart' move she does wipes aggro.  That's the tough part of this fight.<br />
<br />
So, the mage can be any ranged dps.  They should stand back and dps, stopping when she farts and wipes aggro.  This is a *no DoT* fight.  That means no fireball, no stings, no moonfire.  If you DoT she going to come straight for you after she's done farting.  This is what wipes most groups.<br />
<br />
The paladin is the catch-all here.  He should dps, keep himself healed without support, and back up the tanks by snapping aggro should the part I'm about to explain goes wrong.<br />
<br />
Have your ranged dps pull her in.<br />
<br />
The warrior should charge (like feral charge) to get a quick stun.  That'll buy him a few second to get aggro.<br />
<br />
At this point only your warrior and paladin are in melee, the ranged dps is going, and the resto druid is healing the warrior only.<br />
<br />
The feral druid should be doing nothing but maybe fairie fire.<br />
<br />
As soon as she's done farting the warrior and pally should run back to the wall.  The feral druid should shift to bear and feral charge as soon as she's done.<br />
<br />
The warrior gets healed and switches to ranged dps.  The paladin self heals and goes back into melee.<br />
<br />
When she farts again, the warrior should intercept or just run up and taunt while the paladin and feral druid back off and heal.<br />
<br />
If your restoration druid is running low on mana the feral druid and paladin should step up, allow him to innervate without having to cast, then go back to the regular routine.<br />
<br />
The feral druid should conserve mana somewhat to back up heal if the resto druid has used all his mana tricks.  This is somewhat tough as the feral druid has to shift out of, then back into bear form for free Furor rage for an immediate feral charge on the tank swap.  Note that your feral druid should be using balanced or mana gear, not damage gear.  He's got to be *both* a caster and a tank.<br />
<br />
This is a slow method, but it will work well with the group you have.  It's a good routine to practice.  This is essentially what's required, for slightly different reasons, in AQ20's first boss.</div></div><hr />

Thanks LOADS for the detailed response, it is much appreciated.  <br />
<br />
You mean the wall at the back on her platform ( assuming you are facing &quot;her&quot; from where the giants were ) ?  I don't remember seeing any turtles there, but we weren't able to keep her there long so I could be mistaken.  <br />
<br />
Again, thanks a LOT! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">03-01-2006, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're standing where the last set of two giants are and facing the princess, the wall is straight ahead behind the princess.  Run around her and pull to there.<br />
<br />
There are a few yellow (in color and aggro) turtles back there.  You kill them so that they don't accidentally add if the druid or warrior AoE taunts (Demo Roar/Shout).  You also want to keep Challenging Roar and the equivalent warrior move available in case of a hiccup.  If the turtles are there they will add.<br />
<br />
If you've got a warlock you can place an imp at the spot where the tank should stand.  It'll provide a good marker on the changeups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">03-01-2006, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easier way takes a bit more of a tank and healer.  Everyone just stop dps when she farts until the warrior regains aggro.  Heal through the AoE damage.  That's what I always did.  The rogue usually died.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember exactly why, I think it's something to do with stopping heals from working.  I just know that in all the groups I've been on, the biggest emphasis has always been on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've also seen a warlock solo her.  heh.  :P<br />
