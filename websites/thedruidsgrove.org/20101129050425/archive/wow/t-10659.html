<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nightmoone</div><div class="date">05-31-2006, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a lvl 34 NE and was bored the other night so I thought I'd do a Deadmines run and farm some items to sell.<br />
I get into a PUG of a 16 pally, 19 rogue, 16 warrior and 13 mage. I told the group that I though the levels were a bit low but they all said it would be fine. Before we went in I said that they would need my DPS (i'm fully feral) so me and the pally should share healing.<br />
We drop off the plank bridge to the cave below before the instance starts and all hell breaks loose. The huge aggro radius draws every mob. I spot a caster to the side blasting off spells with nobody attacking it. I attack in cat and take it and 2 other elites down pop back up to heal. The group has scattered and I can't get line of site to heal. Some of the group are complaining that I went cat and the lvl 13 leaves because &quot;the druid doesn't know what he's doing&quot;.<br />
I mention that I had to take out the caster and that we will need the Dps and get told DPS doesn't matter and that I should be resto.<br />
Next room we get swarmed again. I stand and heal to prove a point. the Pally and the warrior start taking heavy damage at the same time so I heal the pally but can't heal the 16 warrior quick enough and he dies. He then promptly leaves as well.<br />
<br />
In the end the 3 of us left 19,16 and me 34 got to just before Van Cleef before getting wiped, which I think is not bad considering the levels involved.<br />
So, my question, did I do anything that  badly wrong or is it just a typical PUG not understanding druids?<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

I don't know what a level 13 was doing there tho - he/she couldn't use most of the greens/blues that drop - and would have been an aggro magnet - glad they left early.<br />
<br />
Pretty much just bad group tho - Next room we get swarmed again - bad pull w/ only 4 people is not a good sign........<br />
<br />
Farm it yourself next time - may not be able to do it all, but I always had a blast trying to see what instances I could solo, and at what level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took my RL cousin down there while he was still too low, and I ended up having to tell him to stay way behind me and just come loot corpses in my wake.<br />
<br />
New players don't understand the difference in aggro radius and that it can be easier to go alone than try to kill and keep them up as they get wailed on.</div></div><hr />

I soloed Dead Mines a lot to level my enchanting you getg tons of dust and essence for low level enchants</div></div><hr />

If you're suppose to be the main healer and group doesn't realize how to controll agro you gotta tell how, or to find a new healer.It's not worth the frustration.<br />
This was a special circumstance, harder to controll agro when anyplayer in a 50 foot radius agros the whole room.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azurath</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lvl 24 or so i've duoed deadmines with a rogue-Van cleef should not be skipped -He drops emberstone staff which sells for 30 silver. btw-when I was doing dm I didn't invite anyone under 18 because they are just useless. Although  did have one group full of 17's that did better than a group of 20+ due to having common sense.<br />
<br />
One Dm group I had the paladin kept rushing ahead and the warrior went with him. They both attacked one mob and assisted each other while me as healer was getting beat on by 3 mobs...was really dumb. The paladin also kept choosing greed on bind on pickup items such as teh gold gloves...its cloth for goodness sake. <br />
<br />
Your group should be smart enough to stay in your view range- You shouldn't cater to them, they should cater to you as the healer. I've had heals go 7/8 completion then the warrior goes behind a pillar or something for no reason and I cant get the heal off. Of course he blames me but hes just stupid and no sense worrying bout it. <br />
<br />
I think I need to develop a sense of just ditching groups-I tend to stick around.<br />
<br />
Yet the people I see ditch groups the most are horrible players that blame others for their own suckiness without even knowing. Which is the most baffling of all 0.o??</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason I can think of them doing this is because they are an enchanter. Besides that I would agree that it is stupid for them not to pass.</div></div><hr />
