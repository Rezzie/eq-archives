I am a level 35 NE druid, and I am having some trouble getting good and consistent experience these days. All of my current quests are at least 4 levels above me, and just grinding mobs to level is so very slow.<br />
<br />
Where could I go to get quests around my level, or where is a very good place for me to grind?<br />
<br />
I've done all quests around my level in STV, Desolace, Hillsbrad and Arathi.</div></div><hr />

Using STV as an example - have you done all the rebel camp, Booty Bay, and expedition camp quests?<br />
<br />
You could also probably get groups for SM at your level - the quests are handed out in Ironforge.  You'd get XP as well as some gear.</div></div><hr />

My hunter is 51 now, and I remember being burnt out in my mid 30's from the grinding. I did Arathi and Hillsbrad as well, and everything in STV. However, this is the time to grind for cash so you can buy your mount. I am not in a guild so I was dependent on myself and that mount was motivation enough to grind away the rest of the 30's.<br />
Now, a month and a half later, I have my Druid about to venture through the same grind. Oh how exciting.</div></div><hr />

Was my favorite instance in mid 40is. the bosses are not hard if you get a group together.<br />

The ceantaur boss drops a very good head-gear (and is relatively easy do kill).. almost all mobs can be hibernated and the place is beautiful (nice waterfalls). :)</div></div><hr />

There are ALWAYS groups looking for members either at ironforge or southshore, so at 35 you should be able to start getting into groups for it.  The instance itself is in horde territory, so your closest flight path would probably be southshore, so groups generally meet at SS then go there together, takes about 15 mins to walk there.<br />
<br />
SM is good for loot and also for saving money!! Another place for mid 30s is wetlands, theres some elites around the arathi/wetlands border to kill.<br />
<br />
hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

Start out running the library (a PuG will know where this is) and you will get a really good staff - Illusionary Rod - for your caster form, and there is a quest in IF in the explorers area for the library for a good neck - explorers league or something.  In a couple levels, if you get lucky, a kick@ss 2h mace drops in the Cathedral (though 4/5 times its the goofy looking cloth hat with mass int).  This is a great place for both xp and cash, and the mobs are fun.  I've run SM about 12 times with various people, and still take PuG's through as main tank just for fun sometimes (though still no trilune /cry).<br />
<br />
Uldamann (in Badlands) *shudder* is good too around lv 38, but be prepared for a ton of mail armor drops, and bring a couple healers.  The quests are a pain, especially the one for Tavlash's Necklace, but net good XP.  Really cool bosses in there (Indy Jones, anyone?) and the main boss is good fun to fight.  Requires good group coordination and there is a cool sequence of history once you kill the main boss.<br />
<br />
I never ran RFD.  Is there anything worthwhile there, considering im nowlv47?  I am going to take my friend who is a lv 39 hunter through to get him a new bow (someone told me there is a blue bow drop there?).  Is there anything i should look for / expect?  <br />
<br />
As far as the 30-40 grind goes, it flew by for me - I ran desolace from 32-35 and SM from 35-40.  I would recommend spending alot of time in instances if you can.  Zul' Farak (W00t vexing cane!) as a healer may be the best instance so far.  Run that like crazy at lv 42+</div></div><hr />

They are the results of a long series of quests starting and ending in Un'goro. You can't get the first quest in the series until around level 50.

Just got the Illusionary rod with my priest alt (lv 39), and a guildie enchanted it with +9 intel.  Having a staff with +24 intel, +10 stam and +10 spi at lv 39 is pretty insane.  And the yellow glow looks gooood on it :)</div></div><hr />

I moved over to Dustwallow at that point, and managed to blow through 37 and 38 quickly doing the quests there.

The mats required for +9 INT are: <br />

As you can see, both require a ton of reagents, so prices are going to be high regardless of which one you choose. Because of that, you'd be foolish to pay someone for the +9 INT when the +22 INT doesn't require that much more reagents (the 12 Greater Eternal Essences are going to be the biggest difficulty in obtaining, the other stuff is common). Both are going to be expensive unless you gather the reagents yourself.</div></div><hr />

Also on a PvP server.  I ended up going to desolace then after I leveled to 40 swimming :wiggle:  to Feralas (Feathermoon Strongholde).  It's slower grinding killing 40-43 there but if you are a LW you can skin the wolves up to 295 skill and get some nice leather too.<br />
<br />
At 42-43 you can start getting quests from the people in the strongholde.</div></div><hr />

Where do the Greater Eternal Essences come from?  I know that the Large Brilliant Shard's come from d/e'ing.  Do GEE's d/e primarily as well, or can they be dropped?  I am interested in how I can repay my guildie (who refuses to let me pay her even a gold for the enchant).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beltane Cho</div><div class="date">07-04-2006, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I empathize with the late-30s slump - I was mainly a solo player till my mid-40s and it took forever to get through those levels on a horde-heavy PvP server on my own. STV was a fun region, but very difficult to get anything accomplished with the heavy gank factor.   <br />
<br />
These are some of the more isolated areas I found to be useful grinding spots from around 36-44. I'm sure there are more, but these are the ones I used. As repetitive and boring grinding can be, sometimes it's nice to just find a spot to maximize your rest points, take a break from the horde, and grind to your heart's content :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Feathermoon Stronghold, an island off of Feralas is a good place to quest/grind between 38 and 44 - work the dogs (41), then the naga (39-42ish?), then go off the coast to work the crawfish things (42-44 ish). No horde around, and if you're an herbalist, lots of purple lotus in the naga ruins. I spent a lot of time there, never want to see another naga again, but it helped me level up quickly in a horde-free area. <br />
<br />
Theramore underwater grinding was great, too - creeps between 38 and 44, crappy drops, but good for grinding. I did it with a warlock who used underwater breathing buffs and we just stayed underwater working the creeps in the bay along the islands. Horde can't see you underwater, it's great grinding for casters, and you can really get a lot of xp/hour by working the waters between Theramore and Nat Pagle (fishing quest giver).<br />
<br />
I was also told that Feralis Cove (sp?) is a good mid-late 30s grinding spot, but I have not done any of the quests there, although I've walked through the area. It is on the coast behind Stromgarde Keep in Arathi Highlands. It's an out of the way place with few horde and some killing quests that can help you level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*disclamer* this area will only support 1 very active or 2 kinda active grinders if you get there and someone is there kill them and... oh wait um do the right thing. Also um Grinding is BORING as heck but it gets the job done dont say i didnt warn you...</div></div><hr />

Sorry, never posted in this tread and was just reading it, didn't see the latests posts, but don't we have Travel form? the mount is only like 10-20% extra speed, and we can use travel form anywhere, even inside, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Travel form is only available outside. Same with Feline Swiftness. Only benefits you in catform while outside.<br />
<br />
Even so, you can't mount up inside. My friend never bought a mount on his druid and he's level 60 (and is raiding very regularly). He decided to enchant his character with the money instaed of buy a mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thanara</div><div class="date">11-14-2006, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the second set of raptors in the theramore area.  There are basically 2 large parts where there is a high concentration of them.  The second set is beyond the entrance to the horde territory.  Follow the path a little bit more and you can't miss them on the right.<br />
<br />
I wanted to ask about the comments on uldaman.  I couldn't imagine taking a party of 38 level people through there.  The end boss is 47 elite o.O.  I think Uldaman might be one of those instances that may have a large range but if you actually want to reach the end (like ST) you really need to have  more people in the upper end.<br />
<br />
I've been running a LOT of my guildies through several of the instances lately.  My take on them for someone who is 38 would be to consider SM for xp but not necessarily for loot.  SM is great because you can break it up into short manageable sections.  It's also very popular so you can usually form a group in reasonable time if you don't have someone running you.<br />
<br />
The other option would be RFD.  RFD I think is a better option for druids because there are IMO better leather drops.  There are also a few hogs to skin as an added bonus.    Level 38 is great for this instance and i've found that my guildies really enjoy this run.<br />
<br />
Either way, if you are planning on doing instances for xp, keep an eye on how you actually do it.  By this I mean, make sure that you have a plan.  If you take more time trying to form a group and then waiting for them to show up for the instance, then you aren't maximziing your xp/time.  Nothing kills time worse than taking 20 minutes to get the group together and then waiting another 20 or more for joe/jane to 'brb'/gotta get something to eat real quick'/'omw' (but not really)/i'm in an instance and im almost ready/'just getting some skills real quick'/'need to stop at the store/ah'.  <br />
<br />
Find a group that wants to do the instance for xp.  Make it clear to them that you are doing the instance at the planned time and for them to be ready ahead of time.  Also, don't pick up items that you don't think will sell for much.  Try to set up a couple of back to back instances to minimize down time.<br />
<br />
If you can get a high level char to help out, you will be much better off.  I run my guildies through the low level ones (Stocks, BFD, SFK) in half an hour.  We set aside  2-4 increments (4-8 runs).  <br />
<br />
A lot of this is basically common sense that you probably do when you are grinding as well so just try to take the same strategy when you are instancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've been running into a larger number of peeps lately, who are looking for a 'specific' item in the instances and when it does/doesn't drop they leave the party and wait at the instance for another group.<br />
<br />
Does this happen a lot to other servers as well?</div></div><hr />
