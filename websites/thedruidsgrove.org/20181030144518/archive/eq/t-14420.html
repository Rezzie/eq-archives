I'm not sure what rank it was since the spell is only available as a drop.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naldiian</div><div class="date">09-21-2006, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got a pally and 2 mage 72 spell drops in Direwind at the boneyard where the gnolls and flesh golems or something likt that are - to the Northwest of the druid ring, through the griffons and their nesting area. A named golem there, forget the name, dropped the same leather arms 3 times we killed him too - decent arms too, 27AC, 10 or 12 to several stats and 175hp/mana and decent saves. There are also a couple of named griffons right by there and one called Axebeak dropped a really nice melee mask with a ton of AC on it... I think it was 45ac or something like that, with 200ish hp/mana/end.</div></div><hr />

When you run into the zone, you see the giant mural on the cliff.  There is a two level area behind there, one with goblins on the ground, and up on the cliff is spiders.   We had spells and tomes drop off both.  We also got a named to spawn, and had 200 hp loot that was attunable off it. GL finding it =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naldiian</div><div class="date">09-22-2006, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we have now killed all over Direwind, a decent number of kills in probably 2/3s of the different mob areas, and no druid spells. We have seen cleric, mage, pally, beastlord, warrior, monk, enchanter, and ranger tier 2 drops. I have not done a large volume of kills in any one area in the other zones and have seen no spells drops either.<br />
 <br />
Oh well, I honestly am quite happy with the lvl 71 base version of the spells so far, though that is mainly due to the new hail spell being absolutely awesome dmg output for me. I never got all of the 69 or 70 spells, so had no nuke upgrades since sylvan fire. <br />
 <br />
The resist level in Direwind for that rain spell is just about nil for me, and I get a crit on one wave just about every cast with maxed Crit AAs. That puts it over 6000 per cast, but with 2 or even 3 crits it is incredible. I got all 4 once on a pair of mobs too - and as a bonus, my dodge skill went up 5 points right after that! SPLAT.<br />
 <br />
Hope to get the upgrade to it soon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This puts Direwind and Icefall below Valdhom, Frostcrypt and Ashengate for dropped spell rates.</div></div><hr />

I know some guildies got at least one 75 shammy spell right after we left there as well</div></div><hr />
