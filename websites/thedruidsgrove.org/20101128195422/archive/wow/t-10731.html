I just downloaded it via FilePlanet and installed. Others I know have used a program to convert the Blizzard Downloader into a torrent and downloaded via a Bittorrent downloader.<br />
<br />
It usually caps out at 83% and the loses connection</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've got mirrors up and lots of complaints. :)<br />
<br />
I am personally downloading from Rapidshare but have lineup spots in FilePlanet and FileShack incase this one is corrupt like my last two.<br />
<br />
Good luck and happy patching.</div></div><hr />

Went blazing by, came to a screeching halt at 83%. Currently says I'm behind a firewall AND that it lost conenction with the tracker. Funny thing is, my firewall is disabled... going to go use a mirror.</div></div><hr />

Downloaded the patch at a respectable 500 KB/s.  When I finally logged on, the server kept crashing, lol.<br />
<br />
Do we have to post a ticket, to get compensation time?</div></div><hr />

I was looking for file to install it manualy but I didnt find it so downloader was only option . Game is working fine now .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">06-21-2006, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downloader didn't start for a long time for me either, then after an hour it just started chugging away.<br />
<br />
I think the first 83% passively downloaded for everyone over the past few weeks, which is why it seemed to go rely fast and then halt.<br />
<br />
I also think the Bliz system is too reliant on other people already having the patch to share, I doubt anyone would have trouble downloading this morning, because so many already have.</div></div><hr />

I ran ZG that night and got to see some of the loot changes. I must say they are very nice.</div></div><hr />

The dream team...:epopcorn: <br />
<br />
Anyways, the 83% was downloaded passively over the past 2 weeks as gwmort mentioned. The technical support forums were the place to be yesterday. Every refresh brang up a new page of topics. <br />
<br />
I must say that Patch 1.11 was the most horribly distributed patch I have experienced (From Patch 1.7)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repelsteel</div><div class="date">06-22-2006, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lorath I installed the update using the same d/l as you with a .rar file which contained the 3 .mpq files and the updater. Easy does it :)<br />
<br />
About the passively downloader, that is the new background downloader which was installed with the previous patch, this downloader became active last week and started d/l. I had major lag while playing WoW last week so I switched to Windows and noticed it d/l so I disabled the option to auto-d/l in that app.<br />
<br />
BTW we played 0-0 to Argentina :( Anyway both teams already were through to the next round so I think they saved some breath.</div></div><hr />
