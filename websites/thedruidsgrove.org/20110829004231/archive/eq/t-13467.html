 <br />
I am a 70 druid on E-Marr with over 400 aa's.  I am Time &amp; KT flagged.  Almost a year ago my guild broke up and brought my progression in the game to a screeching halt.  About the same time, my work schedule changed making it difficult to join another raiding guild.  Since then, I've just been meandering around EQ without making much headway in progression.  I am hoping that my work schedule will soon change to allow me time to raid.  I have my OOW spells, except my level 70 (Glowing Rune) spells.  I do not have any of my GOD, DON, DODh, or PoR spells.  I have epic 1.0, which I solo'd except for a couple kills done with 2 friends.  I helped many people in my guild get their 1.5, but the guild broke up before I was able to get mine.  Now, they all raid in other guilds so getting help with my epic 1.5 will be near impossible.  I have been strictly soloing and grouping with friends for almost a year.  Right now, I am essentially un-guilded (guild is inactive except for people who want guild hall access).<br />
 <br />
Here's my question:<br />
 <br />
What should I be concentrating on for progression, spells, flags, etc?  I have lost track of everything I am behind in.  I would appreciate any information that you can give.  Prioritization of your suggestions would be helpful.  Also, if you can tell me what I can do solo, grouped, and what I need a raid for would be quite helpful.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to say that I too, do not belong to a raiding guild, however I have been able to get alot of my spells and fairly decent equipment from the DoDH missions.<br />
 <br />
It seems fairly easy these days to get a PU group for a DoDH mission as well as groups in MPG and RSS - these will help you get signets for CoA access as well as spell runes (greater and glowing)<br />
 <br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-08-2006, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">.

<br />
Your way behind in spells, this may be a problem for you in more current content.  I would try to obtain several of your spells, which increase what you are capable of pulling off.<br />
<br />
1st:  Mire Thorns - this is a low resist check snare you can buy for 120 crystals from DoN Camps.  For most exp groups this will replace ensnare as it is rarely resisted.  <br />
<br />
If you do DoN Progression (can solo all except 2 events, one requiring a group, one a small raid) you gain 2 AA Skills (10 all stat cap, +200hp/mana) as well as your 69 Snare (stronger verison of the 61 buyable snare)<br />
<br />
2:  Skin of the Reptile - this will run you through the 68 Mission Arc in Stoneroot Falls. You will need a group for this.  You will possiably upgrade 4 slots (Shoulders, Mask, Cloak and Neck) as well as possiable chest drops and after completing all 5, gain a spell which helps with healing by a large margain in certain cases.<br />
<br />
3rd:  Aura of the Grove should be soloable for you.  As people are working on PoR currently, you may be able to join a group in North Ro for your Takish-Hiz missions and obtain Aura of Life.  You stand a chance at random drops here as well.<br />
<br />
After doing these I would try to go back and get the other 2 DoD Spells (with 9 possiable upgrades + random chests) - all grouped missions as well as finish out your 70 Runes (possiably soloable depending on gear, best off in group).<br />
<br />
Aside from that, based on what you've said you should look at getting 2-3 groups toghter and finishing out your 1.5<br />

 <br />
What you need really depends on what your goals are.  Are you looking for casual raiding, 3 day a week raiding or hard core raiding?<br />
 <br />
If you need gear upgrades look into the DoDH missions like Fenier said, the shaman boards have a great link to all the loot you get by default just for completing the mission. <br />

 <br />
Progression wise, if you are planning on joining another raiding guild there are a few quests you need to start working on depending on the guild your looking to join.  Some of them are PITA, some are fairly easy.. all require helpful friends to make it easier.<br />
 <br />
OOW/Citadel of Anguish:<br />
 <br />
http://crucible.samanna.net/viewtopic.php?t=158&amp;highlight=signet<br />
 <br />
You'll need the signets before any Anguish level guild will take you.<br />
 <br />
DoDH/Demiplane of Blood<br />
 <br />
http://samanna.net/gen.info/prog.bloodkey.shtml<br />
 <br />
Most guilds are going to expect you to have part 1 done at least to get you to Vule.  The rest you would need guild help with or other raiding friends.<br />
 <br />
PoR/whatever zone<br />
 <br />
http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13459<br />
 <br />
Being my guild lags behind a expansion or more .. sigh.. well, no clue whats required there yet.<br />
 <br />
As for spells, yeah what Fenier said, but if you're looking to join a CoA or Dodh/demiplane raiding guild focus on getting your OOW signets done first.  They won't care if you have Skin of the Reptile or not right away and the other 2 DoDh spells aren't worth focusing your time on since guilds don't care one way or the other if you have them.  The aura you might as well get since its just a walk in the park.<br />
 <br />
Of course if your looking to join a God/Tacvi level guild, just sit back and enjoy b/c you really haven't missed alot of spells that are critical to raiding.</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ...Reptile is a great spell on raids; most guilds that I talk to definately care if the app has or is working on reptile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-12-2006, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experiance, when looking at druids, guilds care very much that the Druid has, or is working on having, all spells related to healing and curing.<br />
<br />
Reptile is a spell which is useful - depending on encounter.  But rest assured when you need it, its very handy.  <br />
<br />
Aura of Life isn't a deal breaker, I wouldn't think, but since its so easy (and Grove is soloable) I would for sure pick it up.<br />
<br />
Also, and this is important - be sure to get Moonshadow once the quest is fixed.<br />

 <br />
It may be useful, but in &quot;general&quot; I'd guess most guilds aren't going to require reptile as much as they are going to expect you to have CoA signets or Dreadspire Keep access and soon enough ToB access (based on what the guild you are looking to join raids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">03-17-2006, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reptile is not a raid-critical spell in the same way as having group steeloak or your best possible heal spell, while useful there isn't an encounter I can name that would be made significantly easier or requires the use of that spell.<br />
<br />
If I were in your position, I would probably work on getting some groups in Riftseekers to round out whatever AAs you need (most likely all of your healing and curing ones if you're raiding and haven't gotten them or the latest versions yet) and collect your glowing runes.  Then move on to the newer spells/access quests like Dreadspire, Anguish, etc.. and on the side work on other DoD missions for the gear if you have some weak slots you'd like to improve.  As mentioned above it does matter where you want to jump back into the raiding scene.<br />
<br />
Time - you're probably set to join one.<br />
Tacvi - there's some flagging but you can most likely get piggied in or do the access quests<br />
Anguish - Signets quest and you might be fine, if the guild looks a lot at gear, consider doing DoD missions to round out weak slots.  Riftseekers is usually a good bet for glowing runes as well.<br />
DoN - Not much actually ~needed~ but fire/cold resist are nice for dealing with dragons.<br />
DoD - Dreadspire access quest, fill out all weak slots with DoD mission gear.<br />
PoR - Theater of Blood access quest (which will give you your 70 aura and moonshadow in the process).  ToB is kinda nasty with AEs so good gear is highly recommended.<br />
<br />
In general, if you need gear - DoD missions, if you need spells - do appropriate missions/exp zones, and do the access quest(s) for the content you're going to be raiding with the new guild.</div></div><hr />
