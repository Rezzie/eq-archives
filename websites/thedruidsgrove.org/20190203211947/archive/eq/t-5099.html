So i was wondering about some good soloing spots in PoAir, earth or water, not flagged for fire for another week prolly.  Thanks<br />

<br />
Water, what kinda sicko wants to solo summoning mobs underwater with traps and see invis mobs mixed in.  I'll pass thanks<br />
<br />
Earth, Earth comes closest, if by somechance you can manage to find some armadillo dropplings to charm, you could actually engage a mob to fight.  Unfortunately, you'd prolly go OOM trying to heal his scrawny ass from the 700-900 damage swings he's going to be taking from an unslowed.  Then summoned.  Then be looking for the services of a priest.<br />

Fire is the only elemental plane thats soloable.  It has 3 ok solo camps and it works out ok to share them due to their size.  Though if your like the rest of us, its better to group with someone so you don't have to run in the same circle for 15 minutes per mob.  You can kill it in 7 minutes and let your partner  take a turn.<br />

Nothing in here is soloable all mobs summon, even a single group can easely get into trouble here, really sux zone to much lag stupid patching etc..<br />
Everything see invis.<br />
<br />
Plane of earth<br />
<br />
Nothing in here is soloable, all mobs summon. Can get very good exp with a single group camping zone in, or pull to a wall spot, some decent trade skill loot also, if you are into that stuff.<br />
Everything see invis<br />
<br />
Plane of water<br />
<br />
Some mob are soloable, Regrua, can be snared dont summon. They are very deep in, and you will have to pass see invis mobs to get down to them. Can make some very good cash or food with their claws.<br />
Triluin champion, Regrua sentry, and all named mobs see invis. all other mobs can be passed with invis.<br />
<br />
Plane of fire<br />
<br />
In general 3 spots very easy to solo.<br />
<br />
First field (zone in) All mobs before castle, are pretty easy to solo. Some mobs here is snare imune, so you must be able to handle mobs without snaring them.<br />
Bird spot (between first castle and the bridge) If both birds are dead u can single kite mobs here, magma guardians and what ever u like to pull from second field. all mobs in second field is snareable, can be quite resistant though, so be prepared to have a lot of early root breaks, and resist.<br />
Picnic table (Fennin ro trigger spot) Can kite this spot very easy, tons of room, if Fennin ro is dead can kite all way into his house. All mobs snareable somewhat resistant though.<br />
Named mobs see invis, most normal mobs dont see invis, although a few does, so con mobs before you move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">10-05-2003, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">last i checked, almost every single doomfire in the 2nd castle sees invis.<br />
<br />
The thing about them however, is they have a small aggro range. To get into the castle, run a straight line between the 2 door guards, when the other 2 mobs are pathing to the right, and left too. You need to stay an even distance between mobs usually and they won't aggro. Also, there is no need to run all the way up to fennin's room to kite. Just kite in the area by the picnic table.<br />
<br />
ill post more info later i gues, kiting here now :D</div></div><hr />
