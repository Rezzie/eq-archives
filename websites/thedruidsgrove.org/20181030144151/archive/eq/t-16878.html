<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">10-23-2008, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I bought Teleport Bind immediately.  As I box a beastie regularly, it basically gives the beast the functionality of having a secondary bind point as well.  I was expecting a targetable AA that would send a single target to their own bind point, but personally I forsee much greater use out of the AA as-is.<br />
<br />
I also bought Omnipotent Raging Gift of Exquisite Radiant Super Mana.<br />
<br />
The other 16 AAs I had banked remain unspent at the moment.  Undecided where I should throw those points.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Will be getting teleport gate next time I log on, and also as posted above, 'Super Special Omnipotent Raging Gift of Exquisite Radiant Awesome Mana' is on my list.</div></div><hr />

I did the same thing, bought that and am waiting to spend the rest. I will not buy Gift until there are actually SoD spells that I am regularly casting, and there are none at level 81 worth casting (I have rk3 torrid which is better until 83 I think)</div></div><hr />

Even though it only lasts for a few minutes, it's those few minutes that makes my dps skyrocket and my e-peen happy. I like pretending I'm a wizard sometimes.</div></div><hr />
