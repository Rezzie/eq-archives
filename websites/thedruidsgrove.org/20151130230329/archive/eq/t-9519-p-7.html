I wonder if you need to be out of their range for the event to pop, after all it's supposed to be a secret meeting, if someone is standing there they just don't pop? Would be interesting to see if someone was invised in ring and they popped vs being uninvised in ring and not getting the pop. Or then again maybe the event has issues.. Wait , NM we all know there are no bugs in EQ, just ask any GM...<br />

<br />
Really tough to ask a friend or two to sit there for 12 hours on the *chance* that a epic mob may spawn.  And south end of South Karana is not the fastest place to get folks upon a spawn that will despawn in 15-20 mins.  Soloing it runs the risks of not being able to kill the 3 mobs in the time alotted requiring a return attempt.  Sounds like a huge bottleneck to me requiring druids to line up and sit in SK for days.  :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to Exodus me and my warrior and monk friends out. There was another druid 'watching' the event and I sent him tell that the Raider was all his since time constraints made it impossible for my group to stay and try again. Me and friends then ported to Pok. The Druid then sent me tell about 5 mins later that the Raider had not dropped the item. So. . . ? It may be that since he engaged the Raider immediately upon my departure, it did not de-spawn.</div></div><hr />

Set up over at the KodTaz zone line. By this time the event will have spawned. 10 Reborns will spawn and 1 Ritual Conduit. Have your FD puller pull the Reborns 2 or 3 at a time. After a few of the Reborns, the Ritual Conduit will despawn and a Noc Juggernaut will spawn. Continue to kill the reborns until they are all dead. FYI The Ritual Conduit and Noc Juggernaut are tethered to the Center of the Platform. They will warp back and drop aggro.<br />

Take the right fork of the river and keep going, but angle up the side of the mountains on your right.  You'll see the Qinimi zone eventually...you wanna run past the Qinimi zone and keep going.  After a bit you'll see a stone platform structure with what looks like a rune-marked stone set in front of a wall to the right of the platform structure.  That stone is the Kod'taz zone, and I believe that platform is where the event spawns.</div></div><hr />

You hear the cries of animals and the sound of footsteps running towards you.  A little female halfling druid comes up out of breath, &quot;Karana's forest is over run with poachers! The animals need your help!  Hurry! I must find more help!&quot;<br />

 <br />
If so, the 3 slots would be:<br />
 <br />
- Clear Mind Crystal<br />
- ??? Fertilizer of some sort ???<br />
- ???<br />
 <br />
If we are looking for only the fertilizer, then what would the third item be? Silanda says we would need a &quot;special pot to put it in.&quot; The Aerated Pot Shell has a lore of &quot;The outer shell of a two-layer pot for plants.&quot; This leads me to believe that there is more to this combine and that it is not the third item to go inside the soil. Either we need to combine a fertilizer, some other item, and the Clear Mind Crystal in the earth, or we need to find the rest of the aerated pot (not the 1.0 bypass pot, maybe Lucy ID 62861,2,3 etc.) and make a container for the crystal and the fertilizer, and some type of fertile soil that is not a container. This would mean that the Fertile Earth (ID# 72091) is not part of the combine. I know that Lucy IDs do not necessarily dictate whether or not something is part of our epic, but there is the possibility that there is some other kind of fertile soil inside the range of items we have seen so far.<br />
 <br />
Another idea is that there is a multiple-step combine. 3 items inside the Fertile Earth to create some sort of fertilized soil with the crystal, and then another combine to create another form of the aerated pot inside which we need to combine this completed earth with our seed......<br />
 <br />
I'm stuck at work for a 24 hour duty, so I cannot run the item updater to get ID's on the crystal fragments, noc blood, and other new items. Can someone please update?<br />
 <br />
Great job on all of the hard work everyone is putting into this! This is what makes the game great.</div></div><hr />

I still believe that there are some more combining steps to be taken before the final growing of our epic.

For those that dont know, they are located in AS...in two little Garden Kiosks, side by side.  One gnome will react and say some stuff...the other ignores you.  Might be worth a shot...im going to bed now....see you guys tomorrow.<br />

There is a massive lineup of peeps on saryrn server that need it and its just not happening. We do know that some druids have failed it and the respawnt ime has been insane. Not sure if this is a contributing factor or not but we really need some firm information on whats going on cause saryrn server people gonna be a line from hell getting caught up.<br />
<br />
<br />
I went to SK last night to find 2 druids waiting for the coven to spawn.  The first one had been there at least 4 hours already, so I put my name in the hat for the 3rd spawn and went off to forage in EJ.  3 hours later the first druid still hadn't seen the coven.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the bear in PoJ, its a 2hr spawn.  The first one gave the message &quot;this NPC cannot be charmed&quot;, killed it, the next one was charmable and gave the seeds.<br />
<br />
The problem seems to be, sometimes the bear runs out and gets killed, othertimes it runs out, and the gaolers aggro the druid rather than the bear.  There can be up to 5/6 out there meaning the druid either dies before the bear or has to evac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true that this portion seems slightly bugged. The best way for a Druid to handle this event while being considerate of the folks in line behind them is to egress out, come back and kill the bear. When I had to kill mine nothing assisted, and it took one Summer's Flame and one Storm's Fury, so it's a pretty quick kill (both shots were unfocused and no crits).<br />
<br />
Also, for folks KoS to the bear's roommates, he doesn't assist them if you kill them before you do the charm. If you charm him before killing the KoS cellmates I'm fairly certain you will get aggro, so best to kill the others before charming. Also the Archmage with the pets in that cell has 2 pets. They are linked to him, so that if you attack him first he will aggro as well. But at level 66 if I aggrod a pet it would come singley, so I killed both and then the Archpriest.</div></div><hr />

Opened the note and stared at it while waiting for the spawn.  Wasted a beautiful Sunday.  And Nada.  At 2AM last night, there were 6 druids waiting for the spawn.

&lt;!-- / message --&gt; Well, it has been mentioned you need the bowl, however, the Noc Event is not an instant spawn. It takes ~5 min of being in the zone to spawn (not instant). Also as stated before, there is no respawn wait time (besides the 5 minute wait) to respawn event. <br />

<br />
I killed the Furtive the night before. I was too tired to do anymore so I just went to bed and hoped I could get it done the next day. I woke up, logged on, got myself a tank and zoned into SK right at Midnight. I had made sure to bind myself right outside of the druid ring. As soon as I gated to the ring at midnight, the Coven was up. I didn't gate directly to the ring... I zoned into SK from NK and then gated to the ring. <br />
<br />
As soon as I dropped at my bind point, the Coven was there. My tank still hadn't zoned in so I just agro'd the coven and tried to get each of them snared and rooted while waiting. <br />
<br />
So, I have proved that you don't have to spawn the Coven right after you kill the Furtive. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the thing that is burning me is the part in Natimbi. I have been diligent about not even running by that spawn point to trigger the event unless I know I have the people with me to help. I don't have room in my bank to store the stuff so, I have my quest crap on me at all times. I'm not sure how triggering the event by &quot;accident&quot; messes with other's chances at doing the event and I don't want to ruin it for anyone else that is actually prepared. I think that's just rude. I've heard that if you go by it with invis the event won't trigger, until that is proven, I'm not even going to chance it cause I have too much respect for others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Backup your claims. These things you say are meaningless, and not worth 2cp. <br />
<br />
- I HAVE tried to kill furtive and then zone in SK, all within 2 hours of one another; no luck. <br />
- I have tried invis, uninvis, being exactly at coven spawner spot, porting in at the last second, you name it I have tried it. 13 cycles it took me to get it done. <br />
- Some have waited for 20 cycles, etc etc. <br />
<br />
In other words, your supposed &quot;facts&quot; are not true, and thus your opinion is invalid.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can see that *might* be it is the number of peeps in zone who are not flagged for the quest. When mine finally spawned, there were 2 people in the zone : me and a 28 chanter. I got in game at 4pm game time, in SK, buffed myself, invised, and settled down to wait til it popped at midnight.<br />
<br />
I also have a druid friend who got it in the wee hours of the morning... I asked, he was the only one in the zone.<br />
<br />
Every other time I have tried, there were a number of peeps in the zone, ranging from 5 to more than 12, and... it didnt spawn. Might just be a coincidence, though<br />
<br />
Anyone ever got a spawn with more than, say, 5 (unflagged for the quest) people in the zone?<br />

I just did this.  Killed furtive figure, went straight from there to SK, waited until 12am game time.  No pop. As far as people in zone, I was alone until 1am game time.</div></div><hr />

Back to the Fertilizer. I really don't think that the fertile earth would be the same for us if it is a part of the ranger epic quest. I think we need to be spamming Npc's about Fertilizer or fertile earth or something, and again about a pot, and perhaps about a &quot;Arrated Pot&quot; I know lots of us have the pot shell, but we might need.. oh a noc fang, and a few runes to make the pot into the pot we need for the epic. Just a few ideas.<br />

Oh if anyone has the earth already, and has the noc fang and the two runes, try combinding them inside the fertile earth, we might get a lucky surprise. I havent foraged them myself, otherwise I'd already be trying :)</div></div><hr />

Druid 66 is first in line. There is a level 67 druid behind her. If conditions are right (IE read the note, everyone far back from the event or invis) the script spawns. The script is not for that first druid in the games eyes. It's for Mr Druid that is 67. We tested this thru 3 spawns last night and 4 spawns the day before.

That ties in with my experience. I did it a RL day after getting the note, there was another druid there so I camped out before 12AM game time and back in about 10 mins later (didn't want me spawning the event if it works like that and using an invisible flag or whatever). The druid before me (lvl 69) was killing the spawns when I came back in at about 3AM game time. I waited an eq day and sat invis about 200 loc east of ring. A 65 druid turned up to help and said he had camped it 12 times to no avail. It spawned for me first time - I'm 68.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Now... assuming SoE DID keep the quests &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot; to one another (which is BS lol), we would have only one more mob to kill before epic is solved, and the mob would likely be in an OoW zone. We have already done more side quests than the rangers, and if we have to also kill more mobs than them... grrrr....<br />
 <br />
We may be on the wrong track with the fertile earth. Yes, it worked for the rangers, but if you do go by Lucy numbers, we have a ton of numbers to fill. I think we need to focus on something other than the JP ground spawn.<br />

<br />
Even if they spawned every night that would still be a 72 minute downtime.<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, the points after the SK coven are 90 minutes for the HS coven, 30 minutes for the Juggernaught, and I don't know what the times are for the Draniks and Kith parts are, but I bet Draniks is 2 hours or less and the Final raid mob is probably 6 hours plus, but that's to be expected.<br />
<br />
So does anyone have a way to directly ask someone if this coven spawner is a mistake? Scirocco?</div></div><hr />

It just goes to show you that SoE and the devs knew we'd blow through things as simple as they have presented to the other classes and have this thing done in a day. I think it points to our sense of community and togetherness (the holdouts nothwithstanding) that we've been able to come together and figure out this obscure, and totally misleading quest out. Congrats to all who achieve thier epics over the next little while. And my own personal thanks to all that have invested so much time and effort into getting this thing figured out. Too many individuals to point to here, you're all a great bunch.<br />

- what do you need to trigger the HS event?<br />

NOt sure it actually lowers resists. Being able to add to the dps of your group or raid is kind of a nice bonus. So, when you look at it as adding 5% more dmg to every nuke cast, on top of any other focus you or others have, that's nice. Stop whining so damn much :)<br />
<br />
Also, lower agro for healing and nukes... god I love that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semedi</div><div class="date">10-04-2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the focus effect is quite nice and appreciated. The clicky just leaves something to be desired though, I hope it's completely different on the 2.0. Even if it does literally increase damage, one cast every 10 minutes is just lame.<br />

It's an epic weapon, I just feel it should be something... exciting and different, you know?</div></div><hr />

Im not sure what else you could have been looking for - no other class has that kind of ability. 10 minutes may seem like a lot, but given large encounters, thats easily once per &quot;boss mob&quot; when needed. Anything else is just trash that dies faster then you can heal anyway =)<br />
<br />
Though the ten minutes might seem a bit much for single groups, keep in mind that using this on a named with a wizard in the group should help much on those hard to put down mobs.<br />

I am glad to hear that someone has completed the quest.  I am passing feedback from other threads on to Dev to look into.<br />
Don't expect fixes to our epic in Wednesday's patch. I'm sure Monday was eaten up with meetings, discussions and catching up on forums... then maybe a little coding. Tuesday, we'll see what can make it through the patch gauntlet but that's decidely last minute. So our epic fixes may take the form of zone-specific patches after Wednesday.<br />

Did u guys all compeleted the Draniks event part before attempting the Kithicor forest part? Because this morning, i ran around kithcor forest (without completing dranik part but done all prior) and managed to spawn the mob. But i didnt kill it and i gated..tonight , abt 10hours later, i brought a raid there .. no one else did this event today, but when i was there at night, it failed to spawn at all..after remaining for almost 1hr in the zone which is a waste of time..anyone else have this problem ?<br />
<br />
Guildie Druid seen the Blackened Treant up last night, but had to leave it to help with a Warrior Epic Mob.  We amassed back in Kithicor (was less than 2 hours later) and it was no where to be seen.  No other guilds attempted it while we were away.  We stayed for about an hour afterwards and still nothing.  This morning before heading off to work, I ran thru and spotted nothing.<br />
<br />
Speculation is that he spawned it initially the first time, however, he did not get any emotes.  <br />

I know someone asked about this earlier but I am not sure it was answered - What do we do with the fertile soil container? I'm sorry if it has been said /duck<br />
 <br />
Also to note about the SK ring... I was among the group of Brell Serilis druids trying to get the darn thing to spawn last night. I was not there with Walene and crew but we were having the same kinds of issues last night as well. People were telling me to be invis and be super far from the rings, reading my note, etc. He never spawned for me last night either. This morning I gated back and it just happened to be 11 PM game time, so I figured I'd wait. I was invis, standing *inside* the druid rings ( my SK friend was immediately to my right outside the rings ) and they spawned for me. I wasn't reading my note, no one else was in zone, etc. So, I'm not sure if this is really buggy or what, but I didn't do anything special this morning and they were up. <br />

Fight took easily 30 minuts. We had chanter/mage/clerik/bard/warrior/3x druids. One druid died after 5-10 minuts and resses are hard there cause the aoe especially since we had 1 clerik who had to chain ch. We tried using a charmed pet, well it does not work. The charm broke after each aoe. We found out on the hard way :) The aoe is VERY annoying, thats why a bard is very important for this. With high resists u can resist his aoe and especially the main tank needs to resist the fd. If he goes fd and other people resist it the mob concentrates his hate on other grp members and the warrior has to get aggro back. The room has 3 pops so kill em and u have like 15 minuts time to do as fast and as much dmg as possible. Then repop will hit you and you either mezz or rekill em. The 3 mobs are not hard at all but can hit up to 700 dmg. If you fail he will despawn and u cannot respawn him. I guess the trigger respawn time is 2 hours like all other events.</div></div><hr />

There is indeed a bug with the Kithicor event.<br />
<br />
If someone spawns the event and then fails to complete it (or just leaves, never starting it), then it does not reset properly.  I'm working on fixing that, should be fixed soon.<br />

I'll look into the SK coven thing, there might be a similar issue.<br />

1. In part eleven we are to combine Aerated Pot Shell, Chunk of Energized Clay, and 1 Water Flask in a Kiln. What it trivial skill level for this combine?<br />
2. After we turn in seeds from the Great Bear to Niera we receive Living Brambles Seed, and in the final combine in the walk-through it says to use Seed of Living Brambles. Are these the same item?<br />

I ported in shortly before spawn, there was an uninvis druid standing on their spawn spot, and another druid ported in right behind me we both ran up to the person camping there.  The mobs spawned around us (they are non kos) and we proceeded to kill them.  so it has NOTHING to do with where you stand, invis status, ect.  ONLY thing I can say is it probably needs a druid with hasty note in zone/in range to spawn.  nothing else.</div></div><hr />

The event is bugged in this way: If the coven is killed successfully, then it should spawn the next night. BUT if no one is there to kill them, or spawn them, OR there is an attempt to kill and some/all of them despawn, then the event has problems respawning. <br />
 <br />
Absor said he is going to check on the SK Coven spawn problems, which are similar to the Kithcor event spawning problems.<br />
 <br />
In Kithcor, if the treant spawns, and isn't killed before it despawns, or the attempt is botched and it despawns, it doesn't respawn properly.<br />
 <br />
Absor said he is putting up his fix on test to see if it works.<br />
 <br />
Just sit and wait, you may get lucky OR wait for the fix to come down the pipes.<br />
 <br />
That is all. please stop these statements (not just this one) that are trying to assure the druidic public that YOU have figured out THE only way to spawn the coven reliably, when in fact your idea has been suggested and debunked a hundred times. You just had a run of luck that seemed to make your theory stand up. do it 1000 times reliably, and 1000 times proving that the coven doesn't spawn when you're conditions are not met, and then we have proof.</div></div><hr />

I went to qyenos.. no figure.<br />
Hung about for a while... nothing.<br />
Thought, mmm wonder is there a druid in SK.<br />
Ran to SK.<br />
No druid, bound there... ported out ( it was 11pm when I ported ) <br />
I headed back to qyenos. ( after a small detour of porting a noobie )<br />
Around 1am-2am, he was there.<br />
Twated him.<br />
Headed to SK.<br />
Plonked my little druid butt down.<br />
Did the little egress at 10pm, port back trick thats mentioned cos thought 'cant hurt'<br />
Pop at midnight.<br />
Thank you have a nice day.<br />
<br />
Pure luck. Nothing else to it.  I reckon its as others have posted, its just bugged.<br />
If you twat the figure, it kicks the event into gear, if you miss the spawn it bugs for a bit.  Maybe the pop on figure at 1-2am was conicidental but shrug.<br />
Gl to those doing it.<br />
If it doesnt pop just chill, try again another night or wait till Absor bash's the script.<br />

NO. This is our epic quest, and I personally am suprised at how easy the epic quest is (other then finding out what had to be done with the few clues that we got) and how few camping of rare named or killing PHs there was. Think back to the first epic to get a feel from where I am coming from.<br />
 <br />
As with the SK spawn, yes, this is buged and will be fixed, but again, remember, if it was not to be fixed, it is an EPIC kill.<br />
 <br />
Lastly I wanted to bring up the right clicky on the epic. Is a +5% damage modifer to DD nukes for 1 min on a mob. Why? :) As a raiding druid, I almost never DD on raids, we are healers on raids. Will I be casting the epic on mobs? Sure, to keep the wiz happy, but I feel that this would have been a better focus to be given to the wizards. What would I have liked, something similar to the cleric clicky would have been very nice, grp heal over time and cures.</div></div><hr />

No offence intended, but, you are disputing my theory because you got some crazy hiding behind the mountain while holding the note to get them to spawn, ONCE?  Fine dispute it. I notice you didn't give a follow up post as you said you would when you verified your theory was the sure way to spawn the Coven, hmm must mean it didn't work for you.  <br />
 <br />
BTW I have camped the coven, for 6 nights.  I have gotten them to spawn for myself once, but I wasn't prepared and they got a lucky root, and I got the HT, Nuke, Melee beatdown quick, and they despawned the moment I died, as confirmed by onlookers.   the other 5 times I have seen them spawn I was more prepared, and also assisting the other druids that were there before me on my server.  <br />
 <br />
I have tested all the theories of spawning the coven, and none work reliably.  like I said, no note up sitting on spawn point, 3 druids there, still spawned.  Hiding behind the mountain, holding the note while balancing a chicken on your head does NOT spawn the coven, IF they spawn its coincidence.<br />
 <br />
I have noticed that whenever the spawn is botched, it takes a heck of a long time before they come back, this has been confirmed by many other druids.  When the event is killed quickly, then they usually come back quickly.  Not sure why just what seems to be happening universally.<br />
 <br />
Feel free to challenge this info, I don't mind ;)</div></div><hr />

I agree, it doesn't really jive with everything a druid is, but I'm not complaining :-) my guild is more than willing to help me get this pronto because It will help bring down the big raid targets faster. :-) In my opinion the effect on the staff is not meant for soloing is ok for grouping, but raiding is where it really shines. But I agree, a nice Group heal or large HoT is just what my healing abilities are missing.  However I figure, with clerics being the primo healers, and druids and Shamans getting the trapings of them, Druids get the CH, and shamans get the HoT.  just how it goes.</div></div><hr />

I will test this method the next time I log on to check the coven, i DO hope it works, since we NEED to have a more reliable way of getting this part done, this camp is getting OLD.  when I said I camped it for 6 nights, I meant 6 RL nights, about 4-5 EQ nights a piece. :-(  oh well GL to all druids trying this piece, if its NOT bugged we need to figure out the correct spawn every time procedure.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I agree there is some randomness to this spawn. However, I think having the note in a top inventory slot is smart. Why? Because every other mob we pop in this quest pops because the zone sees that you have the correct Container on you, which is in a top slot. i.e. waterproog bag, bowl of foul smelling liquid. As far as I know, a zone cannot &quot;see&quot; items that are buried in bags, but that could be incorrect. If you're waiting for this spawn, it will NOT hurt you to put the note in ANY of your top 8 inventory slots, so just do it until we get a definate answer.<br />

No it doesn't debuff AGI, but a low AGI is a result of being encumbered, and when you get -500 STR, you are gonna end up encumbered. therefore lowered AGI</div></div><hr />

1) finish killing all the Reborns<br />
2) zone out of Natimbi and zone back in<br />
 <br />
Doing this will repop it.<br />
 <br />
For the Ruined city part, here's a few tips:<br />
1) He does not spawn terribly close to the IZ, but you USUALLY can get to him with invis. If you have the maps, there are 2 circular rooms just below Zun Muram's room. He spawns in one of those (they are right next to each other, and I believe it's the first circular room that he pops in)<br />
2) Do NOT go and trigger the event unless you are ready. If he despawns, I believe his repop is in the neighborhood of 2 hours. If anyone else gets an exact timer for this, lemme know.<br />
3) The end BST epic fight and the druid fight take place in the same room. This is a stupid move by SOE, but it's what we have to deal with. If someone is doing the bst fight when you come in, wait until they are done to pop your mob or you will pop our named right on top of them.<br />
4) If &quot;Souldrainer&quot; is up, be careful when entering the tunnels. He walks right through the tunnels and hits for 2k and mana drains I think. Not a hard fight, but it's tough if you're not ready for it.<br />
 <br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

First, the madman is simply labeled as that &quot;A Madmen&quot;, not the usual desert madman.<br />
Second, the swamp terror aggroed on me as soon as he spawned and the summons began. I had done nothing up to that point. Took a bit for the BL friend I had along to get him off me and quit summoning. Have a quick heal loaded.<br />
Third, the ghosts from the madman heal themselves. Extra challenge thrown in. Have a stun ready and some serious mana regen going on. These boys have some hits on em. Nothing really earth shattering but it DID put an extra damper on my mana conservation as I wasn't expecting that and had no stuns loaded. And 2 haunts spawned instead of just the one, so was a total of 5 mobs to kill back to back.<br />
Fourth, the great bear dispelled EVERYTHING on me.. twice... THEN after finally getting my soe, THEN he decides to go attack the guards, which then aggro on me.. ahh.nice pet.. good pet..:twak: <br />
 <br />
Just a few hints to help you along... I just decided to grab some friends and whack the undead from the madman, which is good as I am not positive I coulda taken em all without it being a LONG root/rot going on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unloved</div><div class="date">10-16-2004, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ran a controlled test today with the Mind Crystal in Qeynos. The Mind Crystal grew warm when I put the Hasty Note in these locations:<br />
 <br />
No note (on alt) - yes<br />
Note on cursor - no<br />
Note on top inventory - no<br />
Note in bag - no<br />
Note in bank, top level - no<br />
Note in bank, in bag - no<br />
Note in shared bank - yes<br />
 <br />
Conclusion... the new &quot;quest item checker&quot; is capable of knowing whether you do (or don't) have a specific quest item regardless of whether that item is on your toon (in bags or not) or in your bank (in bags or not, but not shared bank). It probably uses the same logic as the Lore Item checker. <br />
 <br />
Which means if the Coven spawner is looking for your Hasty Note, it can be in your bank, in your bags, etc and the spawner will still see it.<br />
 <br />
It also means if the Coven spawner is looking for you NOT to have previous crystals, then they are not safe in your bags, in the bank, etc.<br />
 <br />
On a second note, I watched 5 druids come into SK, spawn the Coven on their first night, and leave successfully. I watched 2 druids wipe to Coven, looted nothing, and it spawned the next night for them as well. I also sat there, by myself in the zone, for another 10-odd hours with no spawn at all. I'm becoming more convinced that having a previous crystal blocks your own personal spawn. If any druid is present in the zone with a note AND without any crystals, then it spawns. I'm not quite ready to destroy it yet, but I'll continue testing.<br />
