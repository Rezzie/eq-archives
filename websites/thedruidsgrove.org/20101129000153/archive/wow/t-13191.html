<br />
I would say your spellpower has to be in the 1800-2k range if you can get to 200+ hit and learn the rotations you will hit 3500+ DPS without breaking a sweat.  Get the Mod &quot;Squak and Awe&quot;...your DPS will thank you!<br />
<br />
Most end game raids will welcome a 2k+ DPS boomkin, because your aura makes up any DPS you are lacking.  Hit 3k and they will worship you!</div></div><hr />

Boomkin are hit capped at 368 with talents. Pick up the Ebonweave crafted stuff to start as a base and gem for hit as needed. Your output will Squawk and Awe. ;-)</div></div><hr />

Per EJ numbers, it's 263 if you have Improved Faerie Fire on the target and the Balance of Power talent. It's 368 with the Balance of Power talent and no IFF, and 447 with neither of those.<br />

Things were looking a little rocky. One of the officers left and there was a small flood of people following her. There was talk of an officers' meeting in a week to deal with the problems. The next day they did &quot;a hard reboot&quot; as they called it. Gdisband, form new guild, send out invites.<br />
<br />
So while it didn't come out of left field, I wasn't expecting to wake up the next morning with no guild.<br />
<br />
It did open my eyes to a few things. On my server, at least, there are no real openings for feral druids. Resto druids are popular, and moonkins are occasionally in demand. Kitties are not wanted; there are too many melee dps on raids. I do 3500dps on Patchwerk (and that was before the Greatness Card) and I'd have more luck apping to guilds as a moonkin doing 1500dps.<br />
<br />
The impression I get from reading gear comments is that spirit on an item automatically means it's resto and not moonkin. Is that accurate? On the weekend I picked up Boots of the Follower (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39215) and Contagion Gloves (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39215). Maybe the WoW gods are telling me to be a healer instead.</div></div><hr />

I don't know exactly what my spell hit is, but my wife is a warlock so I get constant discussions about spell hit ratings and their importance on raids. I have plenty of Snapper Extreme which should help. Yesterday I snagged a Water-Drenched Robe (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43401) that no one wanted, but I think the Ebonweave Robe (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42101) is better.<br />
<br />
I'm quite surprised at the numbers you're talking about. I didn't realize moonkins could do so well.</div></div><hr />

First off, raid leaders aren't wrong to want a 1500 DPS Boomkin over a 3500 DPS feral.  Simple fact, the boomkin aura will increase the raids DPS more than the 2k DPS discrepancy.  Also, boomkins will simply live longer, and provide more desired utility.  Kitty can go bear in a pinch, but its far more likely a boomkin would need to go resto to help out.  Big advantage to boomkin in Naxx is they can decurse/abol poison in form!  <br />
<br />
As for spirit...Spirit is a caster stat, not healing or DPS.  <br />
<br />
+Hit = DPS<br />
+MP5 = Healer<br />
+Anything else = all casters, potentially class specific.  <br />
<br />
Spirit is HUGE for a boomkin.  Spirit = More spellpower and more mana regen, + a more effective innervate!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">02-03-2009, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Solar. For a min-maxing guild that is probably overrun with melee dps (DK's ad nauseum) a Boomkin is a huge get.<br />
<br />
Besides, your 1500 dps output will double with barely a token effort on your part. Put your back into it and you'll be at or near the top of the WWS at the end of the night.<br />
<br />
Spirit gear will tend to go to healing druids and priests first as they get the most benefit from it. However, any caster class can use it.<br />
<br />
As we talked about above though, stack hit. As Boomkin you have so many mana regen talents available to you that you should never have a problem. Start by taking Moonglow, Intensity, and Dreamstate. If you are finishing raid boss fights with 1/3 or more mana, drop Dreamstate. Rinse and repeat for Intensity and Moonglow, remembering that you will always be forced to have one point in Moonglow to move on to the next talent tier.<br />
<br />
The days of Oomkin are long gone.</div></div><hr />
