&quot;Most Americans would like to get a paycheck,&quot; Gingrich said. &quot;Most  Americans would not like to be forced to have food stamps handed out by  liberal Democrats.&quot; <br />
I would definitely prefer if the government gave me a house, water, gas, light, electricity, a car, and food.<br />
<br />
And an occasional prostitute to give me a bare back blow job.<br />
<br />
And I would like all of you all to pay for it too.<br />
<br />
Gingrich is completely wrong.  I want free food.  And free blow jobs.</div></div><hr />

| Daily Mail (London, England), The, August 16, 2010<br />

Byline: Paul Sims<br />
<br />
A MAN of 21 with learning disabilities has been granted taxpayers' money to fly to Amsterdam and have sex with a prostitute.<br />
<br />
His social worker says sex is a 'human right' for the unnamed individual - described as a frustrated virgin.<br />
<br />
His trip to a brothel in the Dutch capital's red light district next month is being funded through a [pounds sterling]520million scheme introduced by the last government to empower those with disabilities.<br />
<br />
They are given a personal budget and can choose what services this is spent on.<br />
<br />
The man's social worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said his client was an 'angry, frustrated and anxious young man' who had a need for sex.If you come to San Francisco, you can already get food, shelter, and utilities for free if you're broke.<br />
<br />
But Christians prevent you from getting the prostitute.<br />
<br />
There was a recent proposition to legalize prostitution here in San Francisco, but it didn't quite make 50% of the vote.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see a study on the costs/benefits of prostitutes, as I bet if more men had prostitutes they would commit fewer crimes and be generally happier.  And foreign prostitutes (like they use in Europe) wouldn't be too expensive.</div></div><hr />
