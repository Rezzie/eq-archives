<br />
I have found alot of random leatherworking merchants that sell good recipes out of random that sell pretty nice in AH.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of any Alchemy Merchants that sell high end alchemy recipes?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also getting into the transmuting buisness, just realized that i only need 1 philosophers stone (thank god). and it has a 24 hour cool down!  :banghead_ <br />
<br />
transmuting worth it if u can only do it once every 24 hours?<br />
or is there some way to do more than 1 at a time or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King Burgundy</div><div class="date">01-25-2005, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most high end recipes are dropped or hidden behind faction requirements or quests or instances.  One exception would be Major Health, which is limited supply on the vendor in Winterspring and another would be superior mana which is limited supply on the vendor in Darnassus, if you don't have those two yet.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
Transmute Water to Air - You need to complete the Scholomance quests to get the trinket that lets you see the ghost people in Caer Darrow. <br />
<br />
Transmute Fire to Earth - Vendor in BRD  <br />
<br />
Transmute Air to Fire - You need to get Honored faction with Argent Dawn in the plaguelands in order to buy this.  <br />
<br />
Transmute Earth to Water - You need to get Friendly faction with the Timbermaw in Felwood.  <br />
<br />
Elixir of the Mongoose - Dropped, probably random world drop off certain level mobs but I got it off of the Satyr in Azshara.<br />
<br />
Elixir of Brute Force - again, world drop.<br />
<br />
Purification Potion - Drop, I got this off of a random mob in winterspring I believe.   <br />
<br />
All of the Greater Protection's - Drops<br />
<br />
Flasks - Drops<br />
<br />
Alchemists Stone - ??  Don't know yet, assuming drop.<br />
<br />
Most of the dropped recipes are not BoP, so you can often pick them up in the Auction House.<br />
<br />
I'll try and update my faq a bit more to reflect this information.</div></div><hr />

Make use of your timer whenever you can though.  Once you can transmute arcanite, if you don't have any guildies or friends that need the service, people will pay you to do those transmutes.<br />
<br />
Also, Water to Air is extremely useful at the moment since there is no source of Essence of Air in the game at this time other than that.  Although once they itemize Silithus I suspect the air elementals there will drop it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are a fisherman, a good recipe to skill up is Elixir of Superior Defense. You can pick it up in limited supply from vendors (one in Ironforge) with a minimum skill of 265. It's still yellow to me at 295.<br />
<br />
2x Stonescale Oil (so you need to fish up 4 stonescale eels)<br />
1x Sungrass<br />
1x Crystal Vial</div></div><hr />

There's also the Arcanite scroll, that one was near 5gp - maybe 4 and change, either way, expensive.<br />
<br />
Frost Oil is a quest drop from the goblin in errg... that zone with Uldaman.... <br />
<br />
I've got to believe that Wildvine and Elixir of the Mongoose must drop from a consistent source because they're *always* in the AH.  Some of the rarer ones that I've only seen once or twice in the AH are some of the trolls blood potions (upper), the rage and immunity potions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost Oil is sold by a goblin in Alterac Mountains... in the ruins with the elite ogres.  Limited quantity.<br />
<br />
Don't know about Mongoose, but wildvine recipe was somewhat common from the level 40ish trolls in Stranglethorn... I think we got 3-4 of them doing quests there.  Wildvine itself drops from those trolls too.<br />
<br />
A lot of this stuff you can find on Thottbot or Allakhazam.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Silithis, what is with that place, went there to explore. Is it possible to get past scarab wall? if not do we know what is going to be behind it? raid zone / grind zone?<br />
I'm guessing it will be a raid area with insects... but that zone isn't done or itemized yet, so there's no (legal) way past the wall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wiltin</div><div class="date">02-26-2005, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I may be wrong but I thought I bought Elixer of Greater Shadow Protection in Feathermoon. ( 290 skill ). I am 300/300 Herbalist/Alchemist and seem to be missing just a few potion recipes ( not counting flasks and transmutes ) As a level 51 druid however I can't safely get into some zones like Winterspring to check availability. Gadgetzan does have the recipes for Philosopher Stone as well as a few Transmutes. You can obtain a quest in Loch Modan for Restoritative Elixer recipe ( removes all negative effects ). Best way to obtain recipes obviously is help from friends or guild mates. <br />
<br />
Just a note. When in towns, outposts or cities... check vendors other than alchemy vendors. Every once in awhile you can find a new recipe that way too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">quinalla</div><div class="date">03-01-2005, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most tradeskills have a high end item with a timer on it.  I know in tailoring, I can only make mooncloth once every 4 days and I have to be standing right next to a moonwell.  It is to try and limit how fast those high end tradeskills items come into the game.<br />
<br />
As for recipes, I tend to check the AH about every day or every other day (some recipes are only drops) and I check every vendor I can now looking for recipes, there are often recipes on the &quot;general trades vendor&quot; or whatever they are called that sell a bunch of different tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />
