But he also evade bugs pretty easily he'll go into evade mode when near the box on the east side of it so try to approach the box from behind the wall on the west side.  You can reach the box and not be hit by him if he's evading.</div></div><hr />

Never heard of that...only elite mob I'd seen in the Sludge Fen is the Engineer guy up at the top of the platform.  What level are you?  Druids can easily take out similar-level elites solo.</div></div><hr />

All you do is go to the side of the fen where the box is, jump into the water, swim underneath the wall and grab the box.</div></div><hr />
