<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Duradam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't play a druid much, so I'm not sure how much a druid can benefit from sitting on a horse.  Does a druid spend enough time casting that being able to med mid cast will win out over the mana regen of form of the howler both while casting, and while not?  And how about form of the hunter?<br />
<br />
I'm hunting a lot with a 55 druid, frequent duos and groups.  She has form of the howler allready, and we are debating spending the cash for a horse.  The long cast time on her epic makes me think it might be worth it, same for the lvl 58 heal.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mana regen is worth it.  The horse should not be looked at as a means of transportation, merely a really expensive and nice mana regen buff for outdoor encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Duradam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks.  Wasn't sure if the few ticks of full med mana regen would equal or exced the full time, 2 mana every tick of Howler.  We've heard that howler is the way to go for kitting, but she mostly stands still and I keep the mob toe to toe with me.  well, the dwarven version- helm to kneecap.  :)  <br />
<br />
How about compared to stalker?  Does a horse function as FT3 or better?  Or is the full time ft3 off stalker preferable, or will Stalker stack with a horse, while howler doesn't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MotS/motH stack with everything that I know of, so no problem there.<br />
<br />
You can't be a wolf on horseback or a tree on horseback, so that's why these things don't stack.  You can't be an elemental form on horseback.  You can't cast group wolfform while you are on a horse, because it doesn't permit that form on horseback.  So, I think its more of a thing where the illusion doesn't stack with horse, rather than the mana regen wouldn't stack, but there's no way to test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Duradam says:  Does a horse function as FT3 or better?<br />
<br />
A horse is more like FT25 if you'd otherwise be standing.  It actually makes a huge difference in mana regen, which is why the recent horse nerf was such a big blow to all casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duradam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Right- FT25 if you would have been standing, FT 0 if you would have been sitting.  When the two are adveraged together, taking acount of how much time a druid does each, whats the result in terms of FT?<br />
<br />
I don't have a good idea of how much time a druid would spend not sitting in normal exp duos or groups- if she sat most of the time, the net mana regen gain from the horse would seem to be small.  <br />
<br />
100 ticks with howler, 200 mana.  That is equivelent of 8 ticks of horse-granted med time, as 8x25=200.  So i think that if a druid spends 8% of her time or more over an exp session casting or standing to avoid aggro, then the horse grants more mana than howler.<br />
<br />
I'll ask tonight, or watch closely myself to check, but I assume that without a horse, a druid can't spend 92% of the time sitting, unless a group is very slow.   If she spends less than 92% of the time sitting now, I guess we will spring for a horse, save howler for kitting.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends.  In a fast-paced group, you will probably be sitting less than half the time due to casting and aggro issues.  Here is where the horse really rocks, because you can just stand all the time and meditate without worrying about aggro.<br />
<br />
Solo root/DoT, the other end of the spectrum, you'll sit maybe 90% of the time, so you'll see less benefit to the horse.  Solo charming is somewhere in between the two.<br />
<br />
But most of all, a horse (used to) be a great liberator, because you never had to worry about sitting or standing.  This is a huge benefit when you're watching TV or a movie, catching up on some reading, or playing another character at the same time.  Without the horse, I would just end up standing all the time to avoid the attention necessary to hit the sit button at just the right time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is just me probably, but I find I use the horse much less when soloing or duoing with charm, simply because I need to be able to react quickly when charm wears off, and this is more difficult to do with a horse.  Other than that, I love it.   I don't need to worry about sitting/standing, and I can avoid much of the aggro associated with sitting, so its much easier to switch out spells, etc.<br />
<br />
Its something one adapts to the longer they use it, and finds the right circumstances for its use, according to individual playing styles.  You really almost have to try it to see if you like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LilWolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FoH is better if you have extra mana at the end of a fight.  Why?  Better sitting mana.<br />
<br />
In a group, the horse is better because you get mana when casting.  So clicky items are now 100% worth casting!  (assuming you don't mind that you cant stop it since you cant duck).<br />
<br />
So, both are great... and yes I miss the horsey without the horsey!  It was GREAT!  At that time a horse was better then FoH even when quadding because of the mana regen when casting (even though you loose some when running)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends on your cash situation.  I bought the 103kpp Drogmar.  That is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Horses Suke due to the big head in the way of your targetting.<br />
<br />
For raiding the horse mitigates sitting which draws unnecessary and lethal aggro.<br />
<br />
For grouping the horse eliminates sitting for medding<br />
<br />
For solo'ing the horse increases mana still.  I don't see the great affect on my mana of the nerf yet.  I still generate a ton more mana on a horse than off of one.  Kiting is painful on the slow horses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Glendale Silverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Two things.<br />
<br />
1.  Earlier it was stated &quot;If you want to try before you buy, get the free Befallen horse.&quot;.  Of what do you speak?<br />
<br />
2.  I just got a horse.  I couldn't bring myself to ride one of the lizard things.  I believe now that may have been a mistake as I try to look between those big ole ears.  I found out that you can't forage on horseback either.  This is an annoyance but I guess it makes sense.  (would take some long arms to forage from the back of a horse).</div></div><hr />

Big mistake.  Drogmor &gt; horse because of the head issue.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, about as much sense as being able to forage berries on the run while floating up in the sky across a mountain range.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't know about you, but when I use shrink with a horse I can still see a nearly invisible outline of the horse in front of me and it still affects targeting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, its much better with shrink, but its still a problem.  One does eventually learn how to work around that area but there are still times when mistakes get made.  I have a horse.  I hate the way the lizards look, but if I had the plats I would trade my horse for one today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ClaeophaRah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It may be just me, but I have no problems whatsoever with targetting on my horse because:<br />
<br />
1 - When I'm grouping I'm generally in 3rd person for situational awareness, and that's the only time I use a horse<br />
<br />
2 - I never target using mouseclicks; I either click in group/raid window, use /tar charname, with /assist.<br />
<br />
I started 3rd person playing way back when I could med without a book in my face, to watch for wanderers, and just got used to fighting that way when grouped =)  If you can handle it, it negates the horse head issue.<br />
<br />
Also, I got a horse since the cheapest one was 8400pp, vs. 9450 for the cheapest lizard (and they look cooler, too! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My biggest issue with horses is you can't loot with them using right click (for some reason my necro seems to have the same problem with her drogmor though I don't understand why :p ). Also, when you have to root adds etc it is a problem.<br />
<br />
I bought the 103k drogmor too and I don't regret it one bit, I always use it when I kite and I can easily outdistance mobs to snare them without being hit when they are running (just need to try a few different mounts until you have one that has fast reactions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You can loot on horseback it just takes some practice.  :) <br />
<br />
You can also use F9 to get a wider view so that you can loot without trying to target around the horse head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2172&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Free Befallen Horse&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Easy quest to do might take awhile to get the ph to spawn. I did mine in under an hour but my friend camped it for four hours.<br />
<br />
Bridle is no rent, single charge horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&lt;strong&gt;Solo root/DoT, the other end of the spectrum, you'll sit maybe 90% of the time,&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
Actually, I'd say I'm standing more than 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
Root and snare the mob.<br />
Click Wrath of Nature.<br />
Winged Death.<br />
Immo of Ro.<br />
Swarming Death.<br />
<br />
Repeat SD, WD and Immo as needed.<br />
<br />
Given the relatively short duration of SD, I often find myself with NO time to sit.  Especially if root breaks from time to time.</div></div><hr />
