Anyone that has played a priest at some point more than likely has been shadow. Hopefully most of those Shadow Priests know about the old shadow priest site. Well those that do, know that it has become over ran with spam bots that post viagra and porn spam. the old site is wonderful, only because the community made it that way. <br />
<br />
We have started a new site at<br />
<br />
http://www.shadowpriest.info<br />
<br />
and a wiki at<br />
<br />
http://wiki.shadowpriest.info/wiki<br />
<br />
hopefully with a site that gets tons of TLC from the admins and moderators mixed with a growing community full of knowledge the site can be just a great as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Hope to see your priest alts there!<br />
<br />
<br />
and I know I personally hate seeing first time posters posting links, but if it helps in anyway this is my alt druid:<br />
