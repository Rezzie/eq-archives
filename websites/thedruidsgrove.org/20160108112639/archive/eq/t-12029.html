Wow this could have been a really cool spell, but its already been prenerfed for us, how much do you want to bet they are gonna completely make it useless with a 5 or 15 minute recast. If done properly this could have solved the healing gap we have with other healers. <br />
<br />
They need to have a decent recast time, ie 30s, cut the mana in half or triple the duration, right now its kinda of a mana hog and would have to proc at least 5 times with 1 being a crit in that 1 minute to make better then a single chlorotrope.<br />
This would have to proc 5 times with 1 crit during that minute to make it as effecient. Hopefully they change it prior to live or i have a feeling its gonna live at the back of the spell book.<br />

Not bad, wish they put in something like &quot;makes your next nuke hit for at least full damage and stronger&quot; but has potential.<br />
<br />
Gift of Mana<br />
Whenever you cast a level 65 or higher spell, this ability grants you an innate chance for the next spell you cast after that to only cost a single point of mana. Additional ranks increase the chance of this occurring. Note that you only have a brief time to make use of the benefits of this ability before it fades away.<br />
<br />
Can be interesting, don't think they can make it useful without nerfing a bunch of encouters, so probably a low proc rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Abundant Healing<br />
Whenever you cast a level 60 or higher direct healing spell, there is a chance that they will continue to be healed over the next 30 seconds. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness of the ability and the chance for it to occur.<br />
<br />
For 25aa this had better happen a lot, like 50%-75% of the time and with a decent hopt. If this is some 20% chance at a 1200hp heal over 30s bs i am gonna go postal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Convergence of Spirits<br />
This ability gives you an alternate form of Spirit of the Grove that channels the energy of the woodland spirits on to a single target. The concentrated energy provides an exceptionally fast heal and leaves the target with a brief period of regeneration and protective thorns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whoa for 21aa this had better be some big hot, though the recast timer for sotg will kill it for anything but a situational use. Good for soloing, bad for groups.<br />
<br />
Nature's Guardian<br />
Use of this ability calls forth the spirit of a wild bear to attack your opponent for a brief time. Additional ranks increase the time before the bear returns to nature.<br />
<br />
Surprise surprise, our only unique ability this expansion is an aa just about everyone else got a couple of expansions ago, kinda fitting really. Honestly at least it has a use so can't really complain. Just wished for something kinda unique and cool to give us an advantage in one area.<br />
<br />
Affliction Mastery<br />
This ability improves the chance that damage-over-time spells will have a critical effect each time they are active.<br />
<br />
This kinda makes me excited and probably the best ability there.<br />
<br />
Shared Camouflage<br />
This ability allows you to cloak your entire group in a camouflage nearly at will, causing them to become invisible without the need to memorize a spell.<br />
<br />
Seems nice, but not worth 12aa, sorry but i would rather just mem the damn spell and cast it 5 times then spending 12aa on this. Should have been a spell and an upgrade to our group invis, or 12aa to be able to invis people out of group.</div></div><hr />

You are being FAR too negative. The recast time is not going to be 5 or 15 minutes. It currently DOES proc MORE than 5 times during a minute. I would go through everything you said and correct you, however, that would take far too long. Instead of getting all upset before you have even used the stuff in its final form, it may be best to not complain...especially when I can say first hand the Dev's actually listened (and even implemented) some of the suggestions that Sildan, Nimchip, and Myself thought would be better than what was originally planned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceirras</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some numbers for Kzar (and others maybe) :)<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind nothing is final yet.<br />
<br />
Reptile Skin currently actually has a 30 second recast time, but apparently that's still under review, I highly doubt its going to end up several minutes long. Also I'm not certain if the spell actually will crit if you cast this on a person that doesn't have the AAs to make heals crit. As in it might work on a paladin tank, but not a warrior I think.<br />
<br />
Dawnstrike grants the beneficial effect 20% of the time, and the detrimental effect 1% of the time. <br />
The beneficial is a 50% damage focus which goes into your song window. Detrimental is a -50% damage focus and goes into your buff window.<br />
Personally I'm hoping they will still improve this, as wizards and magicians get very similar spells but those grants +100% focus instead.<br />
<br />
Abundant Healing seemed to go off 5-10% of the time, it might be a little higher, but it surely wasn't what you're hoping for. The effect is a 250hp regen for 30 seconds which goes into the song window.<br />
<br />
Gift of Mana also goes off about 10% of the time.<br />
<br />
Convergence of Spirits is a 2k direct heal (although I'm not certain on this, it does heal, but it doesn't actually display 'you have healed soandso for X'), and after that its a 1k HoT for 6-7 ticks(on the highest rank of the skill).<br />
<br />
Affliction Mastery add another 6% to bring us up to 24% crit rate on dots.</div></div><hr />

IMO this is very worth it, Foliage Shield doesn't cut it anymore and I'd rather just hit this hotkey instead of memorizing then casting Cloak of Nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelfin</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reptile Skin is badass. Tested with a nice pally that let me experiment on him. RSS-type hitting mobs were quite doable to heal. Seriously badass proc rate. ding ding ding ding.<br />
Not overpowering, simply a serious relief on healing duty. And yes, the pally tank could crit, not sure of warrior.<br />
<br />
Soloing with it, it healed randomly between 30 and 768, with lots of crits for 1536.<br />
<br />
My testing of Dawnstrike didn't seem to add 50% when it activated, but I didn't get to test that too much.<br />
<br />
Star, Dawnstrike is 70. Spore Spiral was 68, and Reptile Skin was 67.<br />
<br />
Also, are you sure Reptile Skin is 60 seconds? I thought it was 90.<br />
<br />
Finally, I believe Spore Spiral was PBAE root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, are you sure Reptile Skin is 60 seconds? I thought it was 90.<br />
<br />
 <br />
It's 60, ext buff aa would bring it up to 90, foci should be able to take it up to 1min 38sec.<br />
 <br />
And yes it was overall very nice, there was a recast on it but nothing too bad, it's something you'd only want to keep up on a main tank anyways so at most you shouldn't be casting it on more than 2ppl. For the traditional grp with 1 MT it's something you'd pop before mobs are in camp and it will make the healing load a bit easier. <br />
 <br />
Really nice solution imo, it helps a good deal for healing a tank but doesn't really give any edge for healing the rest of the grp since they won't in most cases be taking enough hits for it to proc enough.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The shared camo aa would own but think that is just a ranger ability... I'd personally perfer that over the bear pet any day of the week for the sheer convience.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The root originally was an ae (frontal cone shape ae) root with a 200/tick dot.  Haven't played recently to test.   Sounds like this incarnation is a bit more useful though =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceirras</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah the Dawnstrike thing is 50% focus, however like all focus it's random, so it would be easy to miss.<br />
<br />
The frontal cone root was severely overpowered for soloing :)<br />
They changed it a short while back, it still needs some changes to reach the form Nim posted. But that one looks nice to me also, and probably more practical than a situationally overpowered spell.<br />
<br />
Shared Camo went to rangers initially, it got added to our list recently also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adrius</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shared Camouflage<br />
This ability allows you to cloak your entire group in a camouflage nearly at will, causing them to become invisible without the need to memorize a spell. im guessing its just like innate cammo, and has a fixed duration as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soloun</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any Idea if the shared Camo is fixed time? Sounds kinda handy to me. <br />
<br />
The Heal Buff is a great idea imo, hopefully, and I don't mean to be mean here, but is it druid only? A type of healing all our own or do the others get a better use it over ours version? <br />
<br />
The AA 2k Insta Heal will be useful on raids I would have thought and am looking forward to it, assuming reuse is not to long, even 5mins would make it a worthwhile tool IMO.<br />
<br />
Overall the spells all sound good to me, no snare though what gives hehe.... /em duck.<br />
<br />
Bear Pet, its ok I guess.<br />
<br />
More crit afflication is good.<br />
<br />
Nothing truely unique though is there? Not that there must be off course.<br />
<br />
Overall it sounds good, thanks for all the info and time to help fine tune this stuff in Beta guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although Convergence of Spirits is a decent enough ability. Sadly enough it's not a 5 minutes reuse, it shares its timer with Spirit of the Wood/Grove, which means 15 mins and using up both abilities when you use one of them.<br />
<br />
Abundant Healing seems to be a priest ability, not just for druids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matren</div><div class="date">09-07-2005, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are being FAR too negative.

No need to emphasive the word &quot;more&quot;, it procs 7.5104 times per minute. Prenerf it proced 8.6768 times, scaled its PPM up on multiple mobs (it does NOT do this now, but the swings from those multiple mobs DO count against the max SWINGS (not HITs) ). the recast was 30 seconds last login, which is too much it should be 7 seconds (what it was postnerf).<br />
<br />
Edit: Convergence of Spirits is currently retardedly useless, recast of 15 minutes + it uses SotW/G's timer.<br />
<br />
GoM has about a 10% chance of going off, Dawnstrike 25% chance (thats 25% chance for Frost of Dawn to go off, Shadow of Dawn has such a low proc rate I didnt bother parsing it) before the patch that changed GoM to be 3 levels of 7 AAs each. It still seems to be the same proc rate as five levels of it, Im gonna do 5 more runs after raiding tonight to get in a total of 10 tests like the last time I parsed them and then I will do the math for it.<br />

Sorry, I guess i have played eq too long, and get used to any unique/cool ability gets nerfed to oblivion. <br />
<br />
Instead of getting all upset before you have even used the stuff in its final form, it may be best to not complain...<br />
<br />
See thats the problem, to evaluate the abilities, i would have to be in beta or buy the expansion. Currently i have no plans to, unless forced to by my guild, so pardon me if i would like to know how useful they are before i shell out my hard earned cash on another lemon.<br />
<br />
especially when I can say first hand the Dev's actually listened (and even implemented) some of the suggestions that Sildan, Nimchip, and Myself thought would be better than what was originally planned.<br />
<br />
Edit: everything i try to type here comes out as an insulting, but if these spells/abilities are your 'suggestions', 'babies' can you remain neutral and impartial about them or will any critism be considered personal attacks? <br />
<br />
Some numbers for Kzar (and others maybe) <br />
<br />
Thank you, i do appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Dawnstrike grants the beneficial effect 20% of the time, and the detrimental effect 1% of the time. <br />
The beneficial is a 50% damage focus which goes into your song window. Detrimental is a -50% damage focus and goes into your buff window.<br />
Personally I'm hoping they will still improve this, as wizards and magicians get very similar spells but those grants +100% focus instead.<br />
<br />
Interesting, though a little disheartened that the wiz/mag get 100% while we get 50%.<br />
<br />
Abundant Healing seemed to go off 5-10% of the time, it might be a little higher, but it surely wasn't what you're hoping for. The effect is a 250hp regen for 30 seconds which goes into the song window.<br />
<br />
the 5-10% is that with all 25 aa's spent in it? Though 25aa for a 10% chance for a 1500hp hot, hmmm. Do you know if there were a lot of stacking problems? or if extended duration aa/focus effects affect it. Free manaless heals are nice, but 25aa for a 10% chance for a 1500hot seems excessive.<br />
<br />
Gift of Mana also goes off about 10% of the time. <br />
<br />
Actually this seems promising, especially when spam healing or chain nuking. Kinda like a 10% mana preservation focus.<br />
<br />
Convergence of Spirits is a 2k direct heal (although I'm not certain on this, it does heal, but it doesn't actually display 'you have healed soandso for X'), and after that its a 1k HoT for 6-7 ticks(on the highest rank of the skill).<br />
<br />
Any more information you can provide on this would be appreciated, I was hoping this one would have been a decent one considering the aa cost, some questions.<br />
<br />
Does it heal for 1k over 6 tics, or 1k every tic for 6 tics. <br />
Does extended aa/focuses increase the HOT like sotg.<br />
Is it a 1 button click/heal, or do we need to activate it then hit sotg, like mgb?<br />
<br />
From your description it looks like, it does 2k initially and then normal sotg on one target. Sotg2 heals like 280ish, so 280ish X 6-7 = ~1800ish. More details would be great. I guess i was under a false impression that it would channel sotg into 1 target, doing 280ish X6 a tic for X number of tics, but it doesn't sound like it.<br />
<br />
No need to emphasive the word &quot;more&quot;, it procs 7.5104 times per minute. Prenerf it proced 8.6768 times, scaled its PPM up on multiple mobs <br />
<br />
It seems like our focuses don't have an effect on it, so on a warrior it does 600 with 0% chance to crit.<br />
<br />
7.51 X 600 (on a warrior)  for 750m =  6.01 hp/m ... hmm interesting has potential<br />
<br />
How does that compare to a focused/aa chloro.<br />
<br />
2810h + 562h(20%focus)+ 786(aa) = 4158h/691m, 6.02h/m<br />
<br />
Damnit, So its effeciency is about equal to a chloro with extended aa + focus. With extended duration aa someone said you can extend it to 1min 38sec?, does the max hits limitation kill it before that happens.... How's the aggro? Is it consider a level 60+ heal spell so there is a chance for a hot triggering off it? How's the cast time? Hopefully its fast cast so we could cast it on inc?<br />
<br />
So far it seems &quot;meh&quot; at best, not worth spending 30 bucks to get it though. If this spell is after &quot;druid&quot; feedback i can only cringe on how sucky it must have been when it was introduced.<br />

<br />
Shrug, i have the tacvi 1hb that i can use to spotheal for 0 mana, not instant, but 2.0s cast time and no recast, usable every 3min 30sec and i don't have to give up sotg for it. <br />
<br />
I am just trying to gauge how powerful it is, since it uses the same timer as sotg. If i have to give up my only group heal for a 2k blast heal and 1k hot instead of a 7k+ group heal for 21aa, i kinda would like to know more.</div></div><hr />

The recast time is not going to be 5 or 15 minutes. It currently DOES proc MORE than 5 times during a minute. I would go through everything you said and correct you, however, that would take far too long. Instead of getting all upset before you have even used the stuff in its final form, it may be best to not complain...especially when I can say first hand the Dev's actually listened (and even implemented) some of the suggestions that Sildan, Nimchip, and Myself thought would be better than what was originally planned.<br />
 <br />
I agree that we should wait and see before we say anything but I would sure hate to be the one who wasted a ton of banked aa's just to test how well it works LOL. And who is to say that SOE will leave the proc rates the same live as in beta?<br />
 <br />
On the surface I like much of the new stuff but I was hoping that the missing healing line we have been begging for would be included in the expansion and SOE would add stances later.<br />
 <br />
I guess we have to hope that SOE will add another healing line with the stances. If they leave out another healing line and are going to try and balance the class only with more aa's that are of random effect then I am less than excited.<br />

 <br />
P.S. Since it's only a matter of weeks (days?) before the exact percentages come out for these new aa's would it not just have been better to tell us what they are? I mean what is the point of trying to keep them a secret if anyone with access to the internet and 2 mins times can look them up? The only people they are a secret from are the poor saps who take a chance and buy them before the numbers are posted LOL</div></div><hr />

You mean the ones that are max AA and are itching to spend on something? :p<br />
Actual percentages are on my to-do list to edit the main list. I have to do a few parses though, and there's also a huge factor which is that some of these items are still being tweaked.<br />

Knockback root with a fixed duration of around 1 minute. Hard to resist, ideal for CC sitations.<br />

I love Reptile Skin.  Crits based on the AA of the person being healed?  How ... odd.  But that explains why I got crits on me and not on the pally alt.  Wait till I tell my partner he has to put aside his tanking AAs to get his healing AAs.<br />

Dawnstrike also seems pretty cool.<br />

I won't bother with the bear AA.  He doesn't last any longer than baby bear.  For 18 AA, I expected ... something.  (Cost was 3, 6, 9.  Not 9, 9, 9.)  Not a bear that poofed within seconds, with 2 misses and 2 hits (350 damage each).</div></div><hr />

OMG is reptile skin SOE's answer to our lack of healing utility, this is it? Please tell me your joking, please. This is it? Please tell me they are looking into the massive healing gap and our lack of effeceincy. Hell I would gladly take stances over this peice of fluff.<br />

I understand.... I guess I was just thinking out loud. I am so very bummed out right now that not only do I not have a single level 69 or 70 spell but I have near zero chance to &quot;ever&quot; obtain one.<br />
 <br />
If I had to ask SOE one question I would ask them this?<br />
 <br />
Are casual players who cannot raid expected to ever obtain their level 69 and 70 spells and if yes then how? If no then why?<br />

 <br />
Grove 3 - 66ac 70ds<br />
CoS 1 - 54ac 60ds<br />
CoS 2 - 60ac 65ds<br />
CoS 3 - 66ac 70ds<br />
 <br />
should be 72/78/84ac and 75/80/85ds over the 3 lvls.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
The 30sec recast on the root should be reconsidered... that and it's duration needs to be balanced.   30seconds with out root is a long time when you need it, if ppl have to keep 2 roots up this spell just isn't gonna get used much.   If it has the 1min duration which is fine the recast should be like 4/6 seconds sorta like ensnares.   Extra mana cost added if needed.   Alternatively  30sec recast with a longer like 3min+ duration would be ok imo.<br />
 <br />
The recast on reptile is fine.   Overall I'm pretty happy with the spells/aa this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, i hear ya. and i was playing with it some last night and saw the power of it... chain nuking with it 62xx+ crits were fairly common. that was without epic and only .3-ish gear mod.<br />
<br />
i have not played with the root much, tho. maybe tonight. is it really 1 minute guaranteed? is that regardless of nukes? that just seems... too good to be true. i am thinking of all sorts of solo/group/raid targets that could be gimped by a guaranteed 1 minute root chain casted by a group of druids with a -50 chromatic check. Time TZ/VZ/Inny come to mind... RSS King maybe... others...</div></div><hr />

solstice strike = 2201, with DF, Dawnstrike buff, epic, max fire focus, and bard song.<br />
(2201 * 2.25) + (2201 * 1.8)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
hmmm... if stances actually happen and affects base, max crit would be 11,141...<br />
<br />
edit 2:<br />
actually, after thinking about this a second, i think Dawnstrike gives us an idea how druid stances may end up working... Offensive mode, buff in the song box with +25 dd focus, debuff in buffbar with healing -50%, opposite for defensive mode, neither in normal stance. so yeah.. that'd limit that crit to 9,464.<br />
ummm... need more buff slots, please</div></div><hr />

Solstice Strike, with Dragon Fire, Destructive Fury, Fire of Dawn and Season's Fury.<br />
That's 50% worn, 125% crit, 100% buff*, and 50% multiplier at the end.<br />

(2201 * (1 + 0.50 + 1.25 + 1.00)) * 1.5 = 12380<br />

*) Fire of Dawn (the beneficial Dawnstrike recourse) got changed to 100%. Also I ignored bard song, because only the highest buff focus will work, just like with worn focus.<br />

responding to Aelfin in edit to avoid needless spam.<br />
Yeah our math is identical minus the epic part, I am however pretty certain I got that right though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelfin</div><div class="date">09-09-2005, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">destructive fury only works on base. focus effects are only applied to base, not the crit. i think.<br />
<br />
other than that interesting info, didn't realize bard song would not work. still 100% vs 50% is nice.<br />
<br />
so now i think:<br />
2201 * 2.25 + (2201 * (1.0 + .5 + .5)) = 9,354<br />
<br />
i added the epic in with the other foci because i don't know if epic affects all or just stacks with the others.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
nevermind that first part, i see you added in df as 1.25. we are saying the same thing then other than knowing how epic affects it. :)</div></div><hr />

When you said &quot;*) Fire of Dawn (the beneficial Dawnstrike recourse) got changed to 100%. &quot; where did you get that information?  I would LOVE that to be true, however Lucy still shows 50%.  Is that from your actual testing results in Beta?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oaklie</div><div class="date">09-09-2005, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my take on these AA's and spells, which I might change once I get to work with them a little.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Nature's Guardian<br />
Required level 59 and must spend 12 AAs in Archetype.<br />
Use of this ability calls forth the spirit of a wild bear to attack your opponent for a brief time. Additional ranks increase the time before the bear returns to nature.<br />
 <br />
Druids who asked for a better pet were asking for a upgrade to Booboo. <br />
This doesn't qualify. Sorry. When SoE says &quot;brief time&quot; their not joking. I'll be watching to see how useful others find this AA before I'll even consider buying it. But with the 59 level requirement, I'm not expecting any substancial dps from it.<br />
 <br />
Where's the upgrade to booboo?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Shared Camouflage<br />
This ability allows you to cloak your entire group in a camouflage nearly at will, causing them to become invisible without the need to memorize a spell.<br />
 <br />
I asked for this and it will help out in raids, mpg and all around, and I'll buy it.<br />
 <br />
What other classes got this AA? What I don't understand is that up to now Druids have been the only class with a group invis. It's not acceptible that another Druid only ability is given out to other classes, especially when we still don't get a HoT or Group Heal or an upgrade to Booboo.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Required level 70 and Spirit of the Grove at Level 3<br />
This ability gives you an alternate form of Spirit of the Grove that channels the energy of the woodland spirits on to a single target. The concentrated energy provides an exceptionally fast heal and leaves the target with a brief period of regeneration and protective thorns.<br />
 <br />
I will eventually buy this, but why not just give us a decent HoT spell or group heal or a way to reduce the timer on SotW/G to something useful.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Abundant Healing<br />
Required level 70 and Healing Gift Mastery at Level 3<br />
Whenever you cast a level 60 or higher direct healing spell, there is a chance that they will continue to be healed over the next 30 seconds. Additional ranks increase the effectiveness of the ability and the chance for it to occur.<br />
 <br />
Not bad, just expensive. Probably will buy eventually. How soon will depend on the chance of it occuring. Wish SoE would put in here what the chances are of this occuring. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Silent Casting<br />
Each rank of Silent Casting reduces the hate of your spells by up to 20% while the ability is active.<br />
 <br />
Like it, but activated? :/<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Gift of Mana<br />
Required level 70 and Spell Casting Mastery at Level 3.<br />
Whenever you cast a level 65 or higher spell, this ability grants you an innate chance for the next spell you cast after that to only cost a single point of mana. Additional ranks increase the chance of this occurring. Note that you only have a brief time to make use of the benefits of this ability before it fades away.<br />
 <br />
Hum. 18 AA's. Again, SoE should state what the chances are of this occurring. Will likely buy eventually.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
1) Reptile Skin<br />
 <br />
Level 67<br />
Mana: 750<br />
Target: Single<br />
Recast: 30 seconds<br />
Additional info: 120 max hits (includes swings)<br />
Duration: 1 minute<br />
 <br />
New defensive buff that randomly procs out a heal. Base heal is 600 and can crit up to 1400+. Duration Foci and all heal / duration AAs work on it. <br />
 <br />
Lucy has this listed as Dot [Undead] and it's listed as undeletable. I don't understand that. Is this cast on mob or PC?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
2) Spore Spiral<br />
 <br />
Level 68<br />
Mana: 200<br />
Target: Single<br />
Recast: 15 seconds<br />
Resist: -50 Chromatic<br />
Duration: ~1 minute<br />
 <br />
Knockback root with a fixed duration of around 1 minute. Hard to resist, ideal for CC sitations.<br />
 <br />
I like this overall. According to Lucy it's a Target AE. May Tunare help you if some nasty mobs resists this.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
3) Dawnstrike<br />
 <br />
Level 70<br />
Mana: 482<br />
Target: Single<br />
Recast: 2.25 seconds<br />
Resist: Fire <br />
 <br />
2125 base fire nuke that has a slight chance of giving you a buff that will make your next nuke stronger, or can also debuff you and make your next nuke weaker.<br />
 <br />
(This has a 7 sec casting time btw.)<br />
 <br />
Another nuke. Don't like the idea of being debuffed. What's the point in that?<br />
 <br />
Let's see Soltice Strike is 2201 damage for 494 mana and no chance to get debuffed.<br />
 <br />
HP/Mana Efficiency is almost the same<br />
Soltice Strike: 2201/494 = 4.455 HP per mana  &lt;=slightly better<br />
Dawnstrike: 2125/482 = 4.409 HP per mana<br />
 <br />
I miss the whole point of this spell. Why not a HoT or Group heal that gives our next heal a chance to be stronger?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
---------------------<br />
 <br />
The only thing here that I know for sure that was asked for by Druids is Shared Camo, and that had to be give to other classes (I'm not sure which one's though).<br />
 <br />
The pet AA is not an improved pet.<br />
 <br />
There's no HoT or Group heal. Why?<br />
 <br />
I sure wish I knew what direction SoE was going with Druids.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I'm just going to continue to group with Pally's when I have to MH.<br />
 <br />
---------------------<br />
 <br />
AA's sure are getting expensive though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noirblood</div><div class="date">09-09-2005, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few general responses to various posts...<br />
 <br />
- Cass, you can get 69 runes from EASILY 1-groupable nameds in WoS. It might take some time to have a bunch drop and win the rolls but I've seen 4-5 of them drop and I don't live in WoS.<br />
 <br />
- Sony has good reason to not give druids an upgraded pet: we aren't a pet class. This has been said thousands (millions?) of times. Booboo was a gag gift, something to farm baby greenies in low zones, not a tank for us or extra dps. Druids have so many abilities and are already such great soloers that a pet would seriously unbalance our class. I'm very glad we got this new bear AA as it is, a swarm type dps addition. It will just give us one more way to dps.<br />
 <br />
- Is Reptile Skin druid only? If so, its a unique type of heal that only druids can cast and that will most likely be cast before each fight starts...in otherwords we can still do our normal heals (also with a chance at free HoT's if you get the new AA). Isn't that what we wanted? I love it. With all the new healing AA's added on I think we'll really be able to main heal significantly easier. Cast reptile skin before the fight starts, hit em with a quick heal or iCH...which have a chance to leave a HoT while you cast the next one (or buy you some time to not have to cast), and a single shot INSTANT heal AA to save someone in a pinch. I can't see how anyone can complain when all we can do now is chain cast straight up heals with a group HoT every 15 min. And does any other class have a meaningful heal with absolute 0 cast time? Another unique healing ability for the Druids. Woo.<br />
 <br />
- I think Silent Casting is an activated type because sometimes you want aggro. If you have full SCS and Silent Casting as passive abilities you'd be hard-pressed to aggro kite anywhere unless you're soloing.<br />
 <br />
- &quot;Another nuke. Don't like the idea of being debuffed. What's the point in that?&quot; Did you miss the multiple posts in this thread saying the nuke has a 20-25% chance to give us a buff that makes our nukes do 50-100% more damage? That's the point of the spell. The 1% chance of it debuffing us is just a balancing aspect.<br />
 <br />
- We don't get an HoT or group heal because those aren't druid abilities. We do now have two unique healing abilities though, Reptile Skin and the instant Convergence heal. Reptile Skin especially is awesome...what other class can give you the chance to be healed everytime you get swung at?<br />
 <br />
- The direction SoE is going for with druids is 80% dps of a wizard and 80% healing power of a cleric. This expansion has taken real steps towards that.<br />

It will be a wasted spell that could've been something unique/useful such as Reptile Skin is going to be.  Anyone trying to advocate an upgraded pet is hurting druids as a whole, soe would be wasting their time on the pet when they could be giving us other tools.<br />
<br />
Overall I'm very excited about our new spells and AAs.  Haven't spent much time on beta, just enough to log on and check out spells/aa for 10-15 mins at a time.  Three runs of reptile skin in BoT with 2 mobs beating me I had anywhere from 15-25 procs.  Abundant Healing seems to have a very low chance of going off at levels 1 and 2.  I blew 13k mana chain healing self 3 full mana bars before I seen it activate, maybe it's decent at level 5.  Bear pet AA is /yawn.  Convergence is a wasted AA having it on SOTW/SOTG timer.  I don't understand why they can't allow us to have these on separate timers.  Although I think Converg will take over the spot of my SOTG hotkey on main page for an instant 2k heal, calling it ghetto LoH already~  I tend to not use SOTG much at all, mainly because of the 15 min recast.  Would be nice to get an AA that reduces recast on it.<br />
<br />
Would've gave soe $30 just for group camou alone.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Great! Wasn't sure if it worked like Cleric's Mark line where it is cast on a single mob.<br />
 <br />
In this case, I like the idea of this spell. When the kills are fast and pulls aren't that fast, this spell will cost more mana than just straight healing. But there are lots of situations where it can be used efficiently.<br />
 <br />
The proc rate of the release version will be important.<br />

<br />
Pally's are great for grouping with Druids. They've got a decent rez, 1 sec spot heal and a group heal I'd love to have. There's nothing that stops the flow of exp like a dead player or two and you don't have a rez. The loss of 10% exp from a Pally rez is nothing compared with a long down time of having no one who can rez.<br />
 <br />
In raids where your group is taking 1-2k AE damage every 2 ticks, a Druid simply can't single target cast heals fast enough to keep everyone alive if it isn't over in quickly. Gotta have that Pally there for those.<br />
 <br />

Both of you are not alone on the pet issue and I understand that.<br />
 <br />
I, however, loved having a pet, which I used extensively until 66. Now I only use a pet on rare occasions, as there's nothing that gives exp where I can DC the animals. I use to love to DC a turtle in Natimbi and clear out anything that gave exp. I did around 50 AA's there in fairly rapid order.<br />
 <br />
The thing about Druids is that they can be played so many different ways. We aren't the best solo'ers in the game, not the best healers, not the best dps and we're a zero a tanking. I was never looking for anything like a bst class pet or even that of a mag or necro. But something along the lines of a Shammy pet would be nice.<br />
 <br />
Our ability to solo has slowly eroded with the last 3 expansions. An upgraded pet would go a long way at fixing that.<br />
 <br />
That said, the AA's and spells with this expansion do give a druid something unique to offer a group.<br />

<br />
Still might be useful, just don't like the idea of casting a target AE root in a group situation. Seems like an agro magnet to the druid.<br />
 <br />
Is it like other druid target ae roots where the druid can be rooted by it if cast on mobs in ae range of you?<br />
 <br />
The resist mod of -50 Chromatic is nice though.<br />
 <br />
The 15 second recast time and no fixed length root makes this spell dicey at first glance. I'll need to experiment with it solo before subjecting a group to it. I doubt I'd ever mem this spell when I'm MH.<br />

Hum. Until I see the actual numbers from actual use on released version, I don't buy that they'd give us 20-25% chance of a 50-100% increase and only a 1% chance of lowered nuke. <br />
 <br />
It's just that this is not in keeping with the trend of how SoE has been handling Druid abilities the last three expansions. Parden my disbelief for the moment. In the recent past, this would be something that they'd given to every class, except druids.<br />
 <br />
In all honesty, hearing rumors that much of this expansion is indoors, I've been dreading it, wondering what about my druid is going to suddenly not work right anymore. I know I'm not alone on this point either.<br />

<br />
I know what Sony has said. And if the percentages on Dawnstrike listed hold true, then I can see that Sony is serious about increasing our dps. The heal side is more suspect in my opinion. I am eager to try out Reptile Skin though.<br />
 <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 <br />
Overall I think SoE is trying and I don't see anything that nerfs druids, which is a pleasant surprise to me. Reptile Skin is original and, if druid only, then very cool.<br />
 <br />
I'd love to know percentages on these things, though. Then I know what I'm buying with my AA's.<br />

<br />
There's a 20% odds of gaining 1-100% focus on your next nuke. But because the base of it is lower, and the casting time is longer, the dps increase will be minimal.<br />

In fact the better your damage focus gets, the less good it gets. Up to the point where for me (Fire of Anguish) simply chaining Solstice Strike does more dps than chaining Dawnstrike.</div></div><hr />

what is going to be the deciding factor is what items they have for druids this time, if we get another gay as stupid frigging dru clicky heal itsm im going postal..VP staff-natures touch, Tacvi hammer-natuer's infusion, Vish quest mask-Chlorotrope, where is the balancing, would have been nice to get a clicky snare item from vish with the 69 snare on it that wasnt mask slot, they made druids choose between a gay heal clicky mask and a 50% to ice dmg mask (yar-lir mask) while clerics got a crazy range, enc got a nice neck ect ect, they need to start using there brains when doing itemizations for new mobs and stuff, its bad enough when they nerf our aa/spells but when they give us class only gear that garbage too while other classes get insane gear clickies its just Bs imo,,,o and where are you Druid equipable robes &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

- Cass, you can get 69 runes from EASILY 1-groupable nameds in WoS. It might take some time to have a bunch drop and win the rolls but I've seen 4-5 of them drop and I don't live in WoS.<br />
 <br />
-Noir<br />
 <br />
I have seen 1 rune drop from WoS in my group in the past several months. Of course I was only level 68 at the time and I could not roll on it.<br />
 <br />
I still think SOE needs to make the runes tradeable or up the drop rate substantially.<br />

<br />
Our heal clickies are very powerful.  On raids you can land 2 heals in the time of 1 normally.  Land ancient chlorobon then click mask and spell gems still haven't refreshed.  Same goes for tacvi hammer.  Outside of raids they are very useful also, farming lower end mobs can keep a tank up with only clicky heals, saves mana for nuking.<br />
<br />
Clicky snare would only be good if it had a very short recast, but if I had to guess I would think that it would be like 2 min recast.</div></div><hr />

Your lack of seeing runes has more to do with where you hunt then anything SoE has done to make them hard to get.<br />

SoE wants us to be able to heal in any zone, but when we ask for a fast heal, they give us one that makes us choose-halfass group heal or fast single target heal, cause they share the timer. They also made damn sure we can only use it once every 15 minutes. No AA to reduce the reuse timer, like we have for radiant/resplendent cures or succor spells.<br />
We get a less-****ty but still ****ty bear. I am NOT a pet class.<br />

 <br />
Yes we have and I sat for hours on Eci/Tunare in the very spot you suggested on multiple days and not only could I not get a group but nothing and I repeat nothing rotted.<br />
 <br />
I cannot get a group in WoS, MGP or RS and when I do get a group in WoS it's on the Swall where they do not drop. The Nwall they can drop very very very rarely and that is perma-camped.<br />
 <br />
On Eci/Tunare most level 70's (casual I might add) have &quot;maybe&quot; one or two level 69-70 spells and a good portion of them just laugh when I ask them if they have any 69-70 spells.<br />
 <br />
Is it possible that not all servers are the same and I have to ask you this.... why do you say that the drop rate is fine? If so many people are looking for spells months and months and months (and most do not have even a single GoD spell) then why is eveything fine? Because &quot;you&quot; have your spells and &quot;you&quot; are able to get groups in the few areas they drop (or you high level raid)<br />

Almost all my 69's come from roting runes in RSS. If you go there and wait you also need to let the zone know you are looking for any rotting runes. It doesn't hurt to offer to 10 people for Runes, etc etc. Not sure if you have done this Cass or just sat there waiting for a rot call? <br />
<br />
Another ok spot if you can get a group together is RCoD, alot of the named are fairly easy even with a druid main healing. 69 Runes tend to drop less often then 68's but I have seen several there, just my dam die suck hehe.<br />
<br />
As for your guild, if they go there regular they should all have their 69 spells so don't they call any rots in /guild? They take 29mins to poof and I can make the run from anywhere in less then 5 /shrug.  <br />
<br />
I think the drop rate for the runes is ok, I just wish there where more places where they dropped. I am lucky I can always buy Glowings at raids if I choose to, but I prefer to spend my points on Gear Upgrades. Thats just me though.<br />
<br />
Hang in there, I was getting depressed about spells and then got all my 69's in about a week thanks to my guildies calling rots.</div></div><hr />

First, your inability to find groups in that spot does not mean that the spells/aa for the new expansion are good or bad.  I will refer you to the suggestions in this and other threads that have so carefully been written to explain the &quot;problems&quot; you have.<br />
 <br />
As far as the GoD runes, yes I agree with you that the rune drop rate in GoD was not the best, but most groups in KT now are either there for runes or have them rot.  Also, that issue was addressed when OoW came out and the drop rate is much better in OoW than GoD.<br />
 <br />
Second, as you so often state, you are a &quot;casual gamer&quot;.  The &quot;hard core gamers&quot; that have gone through all the mobs/zones in GoD/OoW/DoN are tired of them and want new content.  That is why SoE seems to release a new expansion almost every 6-8 months.  This is not a power expansion.  That is to say, it is not designed to give huge increases in dps/levels/aa/abilities to players instead add content to the game.  Not just for the high end raiders but also, as is claimed by SoE, for levels 45 and up.  Also, the aa/spells are to give some new things to the game.<br />
 <br />
I am personally quite happy with the aa/spells we are receiving.  Group Innate Camo. :bubbrubb2 :bubbrubb2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cassea</div><div class="date">09-11-2005, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the past, SOE would loosen up the drop rates after a long time to allow the casual players to eventually get their spells. This does not if the spells are no drop and only drop in areas casual players often cannot play in.<br />
 <br />
I have no issue with the hard core raiders always having the best.... heck I'm still wearing alot of PoP stuff... but before I used to be able to obtain spells later.<br />
 <br />
Right now I feel SOE should either expand the drop areas or or the drops more so others can get there spells.<br />
 <br />
I just got down sitting in RS for over 2 hours LFG (dod not get a group there or anywhere else LOL) and tonights issue was that there was only one camp I could see and this was on the stairs. Nothing dropped.<br />
 <br />
I'll keep trying but I question the purpose in making this &quot;game&quot; so unfun in certain areas.<br />
 <br />
SOE is a strange company. They have one game EQ1 that is on many levels &quot;too&quot; hard and on the other they have EQ2 that is &quot;too&quot; easy.<br />
 <br />
Maybe EQ3 will be a middle of the road game LOL<br />
 <br />
BTW thanks for all the tips and support. I's still waiting on a report on how spells will be dropped in the expansion before I renue and buy it. <br />

Leave lvl70 as no drop if you have to but the rest should be either campable by anyone who plays or buyable if you go camp the plat as a casual. <br />
<br />
For myself I can get them, but it seems to serve no purpose to restrict them from others. What does that achieve? Yep you MUST go earn them so to speak but thats actually not possible for alot of folks, if the could they would, but they can't. Some other avenue should be available for those that can't, at least to me. Having to rely on rots is poor planning on SoE's part.</div></div><hr />

pay attention to:<br />
Spell casters will see two or three new spells for each caster class in the level 65 to 70 range. New forms of spell research will allow players to research previously dropped spells from older expansions including the elusive 69 and 70 runes from Omens of War. The exact details of this research is still unknown but acquiring these spells should be less frustrating than in the past.<br />
<br />
maybe this will help you. maybe you will realize it may not. higher spells require higher mana pools.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you trained Abundant Healing, how do you KNOW it's working? Do you see a message that it was triggered or something? Do you keep getting heal messages? It's an interesting idea that I like but how will we know it's firing?<br />
<br />
Wondering kindof the same thing for Gift of Mana? Is there a message or do you just kindof have to notice how much mana the next spells are using?<br />
<br />
I'm also really excited about the new spell Reptile Skin, it sounds great. Do we see its proc messages?<br />
<br />

You can get rotting ones, but you do have to be a bit proactive about it as they are not always /ooc'ed.

I make groups all the time, its not hard. Just /lfg and ask a slower and a tank, a cleric if they're available, and then get some dps and a puller. It's not completely effortless but all advancement requires at least some effort.<br />
 <br />
Also, you CAN get 69 runes a the SWall. I've seen 2 or 3 drop there off Chimera Seether and Feran Savageclaw, and possibly off Bazu Destroyer as well.<br />
 <br />
Additionally, most groups that can comfortably handle SW camps can handle cubby or tents (which is frequently vacant).<br />
 <br />
It's not easy, but if you're unwilling to explore RS/MPG, you can get them in WoS with a bit of patience and effort.<br />

<br />
while something *may* be more efficient on paper, that doesn't make it better. if i troped everything (or used ancient) i'd overheal by thousands and waste hundreds of mana over the course of a raid. as i build up the mana pool, i won't care as much and prolly swap to NI or SI as my main heal and ancient as my emergency.<br />

NI: 21<br />
SI: 19<br />
Chlorotrope: 17<br />
Ancient: 16<br />
<br />
I actually use nature's touch for the bulk of my healing anymore. i can cast that 27 times for an average 2,200 heal and crits in the 4k realm. i'll trope if i need more.<br />
<br />
while something *may* be more efficient on paper, that doesn't make it better. if i troped everything (or used ancient) i'd overheal by thousands and waste hundreds of mana over the course of a raid. as i build up the mana pool, i won't care as much and prolly swap to NI or SI as my main heal and ancient as my emergency.<br />
<br />
ancient glacier frost vs glitter vs winter? they all get resisted so i use ancient so i can waste mana more efficiently :)</div></div><hr />

If that is the case then SoE did something really stupid.  The Greater/Glowing Shadowspine Runes that I have seen drop all came from a zone that had monsters that were harder than RS.  If your group can handle the new zone then there is no reason why you can't handle RS.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Actually 25% would be an average of every 4th nuke.<br />
Assuming the 100% is a focus and not a fixed increase amount, then it would be 0.25 x 0.50 = .125 or 12.5% increase.<br />
 <br />
You'd also have to account for the 1% chance of a debuff, as this would subtract from the 12.5%. I am unclear on how much the debuff takes away from your next nuke though. Is it a -100% focus that would in effect be a 50% reduction?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but it is a 25% chance for the NEXT spell to be focused. That means 1 in 5 will be focused (depending on your relationship with the RNG gods.)<br />
<br />
Yes, there may be a chance that the focused nuke can iteself trigger and allow the NEXT to also be focused so the reality may be somewhere between 20-25% and consequently resulting in 10-12.5%<br />
<br />
Work in the chance for a debuff and I say fug it and just call it 10%.<br />
<br />
In the end, because it is a 7 second cast, its DPS in chain casted form is slightly lower than Solstice Strike.<br />
<br />
I doubt I try to chain cast Dawnstrike and watch for the buff and then cast Solstice Strike as the difference, at best, between double damage between the two averaged over any realistic time is small at best or, more likely, negligible.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Dawnstrike ... 2175 / 7 + 2.25 = 235dps<br />
Focused Dawnstrike ... 3262 / 9.25 = 353dps<br />
Solstice ... 2201 / 6.25 + 2.25 = 259dps<br />
Focused Solstice ... 3301 / 8.5 = 388dps<br />
 <br />
Then you can just add them up and avg them out as you see fit.<br />
 <br />
ie: 3 dawnstrikes + 1 focused dawnstrike = 1058 / 4 = 264.5 <br />
 <br />
am too tired to go thru the the possible outcomes atm but think in most cases it wouldn't be the hugest of differences. if you look at the 4 dawn strikes + 1 focused nuke the difference is 7dps in favor of casting solstice after you got dawn to proc (keep in mind that doesn't account that casting dawnstrike instead would work towards procing again).<br />
 <br />
 <br />
And haven't had a chance to really test it but looks like skin isn't doing anything atm. I think it should be temporary, I got it the night before they changed it (wed) and played with it some and it was VERY broken then. both useless and exploitable so can't blame them for changing it to a dud for the time being if that turns out to be the case. They put it back on test tonight (along with the shm spell with the same problem) so hopefully the next patch should have it fixed</div></div><hr />

Best so far has been a 7185 crit without using epic 2.0 and without a bard in the group. Nothing beats having GoM and Fire of Dawn proc from the same spell cast.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
to expand on what I was saying earlier, if you straight chained dawnstrike assuming it would take 4 casts to proc, you'd get;<br />
 <br />
ds, ds, ds, ds &lt;-proc-&gt; fds, ds, ds, ds &lt;-proc-&gt; fds you'd be at 261 dps<br />
 <br />
ds, ds, ds, ds &lt;-proc-&gt; fss, ds, ds, ds, ds &lt;-proc-&gt; fss you'd be at 265dps<br />
 <br />
So alternating in SS should be a very slight increase in dps, not at all worth an extra spell slot... but then again seems like DS is hardly worth it either really.<br />
 <br />
Not really sure how other effects would factor into all this off hand... but think spell haste should be the only factor that doesn't change the numbers equally.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
About the healing efficiency thing earlier.. don't think mana pool has to do with healing efficiency so much as the hp pool or just the fact that a fully modified higher lvl heal will rarely heal for full the way most ppl seem to use heals.<br />
 <br />
A lot of the higher lvl heal's healing goes over into hp that can't be healed so a chunk of it is wasted and it's efficiency drops a **** ton since you're paying the same increased mana for the healing you'd get from nature's or sylvan for a smaller mana price tag.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ok. So the debuff affected your next 3 nukes. The damage increase effect only affects your next nuke. Yes?<br />
 <br />
If the debuff can affect multiple nukes and the buff can affect only one, then that 25% versus 1% is not really descriptive. It would be 25% versus 3%. And since it appears to completely nerf the nuke, it's not like a negative focus, but rather a fixed decrease.<br />
 <br />
88 damage from a 2200 nuke is a 96% decrease and appears to be fixed rather than random like the a focus would be.<br />
 <br />
Mag spell Fickle Fire and Wizard spell Mana Weave also have the 25% to 1% chance of a debuff. So this isn't Druid only.</div></div><hr />

Just played around with skin of reptile since my usual tank and myself weren't seeing the proc go off in a grp setting.   Trained a bunch of the mobs in dranik's scar up on the ramparts into a corner and put it up.   It healed me up to full fast and faded shortly after like a little 11secs.   Turns out it has a 120hit counter on lucy.<br />

The log I pulled showed like 144 swings on me (the counter on lucy is 120 so not sure how that worked), 19 procs, procs did fire off of misses, heals were all 600 or crits for 1200.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Examples:<br />
 <br />
Duoing with a Ranger in Earth, it was rare he needed a patch, the buff combined with his avoidance, ac, etc was enough to keep him nearly fully healed.<br />
 <br />
A Creator Group on the other hand, where mobs hit 300+ harder then Earth, you could see the differance, but the tank still required more direct heals - yet less heals then without the buff.<br />
 <br />
Solo wise, I saw it fire all the time on myself.<br />
 <br />
No matter what, it WILL help, but depending on the hp of the tank and the damage of the mob you will only see a 1-4 percent jump in health when it fires, assuming the damage from the hit didn't subtract more then that, in which case you will see the differance probly less you are watching very closely.<br />

I am very happy with this spell.<br />

 <br />
As far as dawnfire vs solstice, I usully use dawnfire when my group is bardless and solstice when we have a bard. I usually use solstice when soloing still as well, because of the cast time. <br />
 <br />
A tip - when that ever so annoying thing happens, that is GOM procing on your last nuke / heal vs a mob, just renew reptile.<br />
 <br />
EDIT-<br />
Reptile does have some good raid uses.  Keep in mind in many situations add tanks are tanking more than one add.  Also keep in mind that unlike offensive procs, the quicker the hits the quicker the procs.  Many adds during raids don't hit extremely hard, but they hit a lot faster than XP mobs - but since they're hitting faster reptile will heal them faster.</div></div><hr />

The bog snake hit him for low 200 then as soon as I hit him with Skin, the bog snake hit him for 1855 three times then blasted him for 23k damage.  Quite the humorous screen shot we got out of it.
