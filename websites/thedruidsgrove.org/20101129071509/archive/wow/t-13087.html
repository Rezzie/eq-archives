I think if you want nature's focus, I'd drop one point out of improved mangle and one point out of Infected wounds or something.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
That's pretty much the exact build I was looking at myself.  It would be nice to take Primal Tenacity, though I don't think that Warlocks will be that prevalent any more in PvP, and those that you do find you will be able to absolutley own.  Priests and Warrior fears are fairly easy to avoid.  <br />
 <br />
A lot of people I know are musing that feral Druids will be really strong in arenas and bg's due to amazing AMAZING burst.  tons of screenshots out there of 8k - 9k FB's.  The only thing really holding ferals back is a truly reliable interrupt, but Nature's Focus helps with that.<br />
 <br />
TLDR:  looks fun!</div></div><hr />

if u get the stun-reduce:<br />
pvp-built (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGMsfrd0eRhcuVo0Eczb)<br />
<br />
and if it is true, that protector of the pack will work without group, then it would be a good option<br />
to add to the built.</div></div><hr />

I suck hard at feral pvp, but I find myself relying on bleeds much more than burst unless I get the opener.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Right now, something like Mut Rogue/Feral Druid for 2's or Mut Rogue, Feral Druid, Frost DK, Frost Mage, Resto Shaman for 5's would be wicked I think.</div></div><hr />

wanna see melees hit on me with 30k hp and 30k armor.<br />
In bear hitting 4-5k crits with maul and 3.5k crits with mangle and 38% crit-chance this should be good :-D</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've done a little PvP as of tuesday and last night... i have a new rogue team mate for this season. We tried to do a rated match Tuesday afternoon. After waiting through the 7 min queue, out first match was up against... <br />
<br />
A ****ing Dk and a pally... we got PWNED... i decieded that i REALLY need to grind some more honor and get better PvP gear, so i spent about 4 hours last night TRYING to win the AB daily. It was painful. My survivability is laughable at the moment, and Alli were trouncing us just about every single match. If we weren't 4 capped, we were losing after getting a healthy head start. I have NEVER felt this discouraged about the Horde in a BG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-18-2008, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have actually seen some unexpected success on the Alli side in BG's since WotLK.  At first I just attributed this to those at 80 so early likely being more skilled players.  The 12 year olds were in school and didn't have time to flood the BG's yet.  But I would say every snot nosed kid has had the opportunity to hit 80 now and we are still seeing relative success.  So, I just don't know?<br />
<br />
On another note: @Serg, Bear form PVP is a blast.  They made rogue's soooo squishy!  They blow all there CD's and stuns to get me to about half health (full Rage), I Mangle/Maul crit, bash, maul again...Yawn, Game over!  :P</div></div><hr />

 <br />
/jealous @ ferals... be glad that Rogues can't dismantle your claws.... I've been playing my warrior a lot, and MAN i hate rogues. If I catch them with their dismantle on CD, its gg. Otherwise, they take my weapon and shield for like 10 sec, leaving me defenseless.  And the CD on dismantle is waaay too short.<br />
 <br />
I'm actually looking for a good Feral Druid to play 3's with right now on my Warrior with a Holy Pally friend. I heard that Feral, MS Warr and Holy Pally are quite strong, as none of them are really good targets at all, but can put out quite strong pressure. Target Druid? Bear up to 30k health and rape with mangle / maul, Cc with Charge / Bash. Target anything other than Druid, druid gets to run around and go crazy shredding and FB crit'ing. And a MS warrior thats smart enough to sword / board and def stance when focused will live a while, Pallys are pretty hard to kill too, especially if the druid is able to cyclone / root to 'peel' dps off the pally. Great synergy between arms warrior / feral druid bleed effects too. Lots of survivability on this team, could work pretty well IMO.<br />
 <br />
Ferals look like they (may) finally have some strong success in arenas in the right brackets. Though I agree skwid... burst is a little insane and DK's / Ret Pallies right now are disgusting.</div></div><hr />

.....<br />
<br />
i didnt had a choice to do arenas right know.<br />
But a DK, ret-palli combo which attack me 2vs1 wont kill me without a dead DK.<br />
Last night i went AB and a DK, Ret-Palli and Mutilate-Rogue ganked me and i stomped the DK and the rogue into the ground until the palli finished me. (Berserk is soooo sweet)<br />
<br />
I will try arena with my rogue-partner the next days, so i'll see how that works out.<br />
Had no drop-luck in Archavons till now :-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">12-20-2008, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my bruised and shattered ego has had a chance to recover a little bit from that AB debacle. I started running SotA for the first time Thursday night. There was some initial frustration of not knowing what exactly to do (even though i tried to read up on it), then, hypocritically, dealing with the frustration of other people not knowing what to do (lol) before getting a decent handle on the situation. Between the honor from the battles, and the honor from turning in BG trinkets, i grinded (ground?) 33K honor Thursday night and 38K honor last night. I am now the proud owner of the Hateful Gladiator's Leather Bracers, and plan to get the Boots fairly quickly Sunday night.<br />
<br />
The biggest change to my stats after equipping them (from my Vindicator's) was 1,000 more health, and 0.50 % increase on my chance to crit *sigh* I was hoping for a little more rawr...<br />
<br />
The loot gods haven't been nice to me from my one 10-man Vault run either, but I hope to get into a 25-man Vault before maintenance on Tuesday. On the run i did, only cloth dropped, including some lock gloves, and there wasn't even a lock in our group. I hate it when that happens!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@my experiences in arena:<br />
<br />
I'm at 200 resilence and at around 28k hp and 30k armor in bear.<br />
and i can say i outlive almost every burst there is easily.<br />
the problem in my team is, as soon as my rogue partner goes out of stealth he is focused down in 5-10 secs.<br />
And i hardly win vs 2 pvp-geared players with a little skill.<br />
<br />
i played 10 games until now so maybe we need to figure out a strat for specific situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
what kills me easily are teams like 2 mutilate-rogues (the burn through my armor like nothing) and a team of 2 PoM Mages.<br />
I never ever ever get to a mage to kill him.<br />
Arcane Barrage -&gt; Slow -&gt; AB -&gt; Slow -&gt; AB -&gt; Slow -&gt; AB -&gt; Slow -----&gt; Dead..... F.... f..... Instants....<br />
Shapeshifting doesnt really help cause &quot;slow&quot; is instant without cooldown...<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: Sadly no luck at Archavon-Drops (i have 2 Balance-Pieces and 2 Resto-Pieces *sigh*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, i feel ya on the lack of Archavon love. The GOOD news is that you can pick up Hateful Gladiator gear with Badges of Valor, so i should be getting my Hateful shoulders in about 12 more weeks : /<br />
<br />
I'd still like to be better geared before I attempt my next arena match, so it looks like I'll be living in the BG's (yet again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">01-08-2009, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cant use Badges of Valor for PvP items before i have my T7.5-pants!<br />
<br />
BTW:<br />
with 3.0.8 my build will be something like this (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGMsfbdbeRIczVocgczb).<br />
mass mitigation and survivability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-08-2009, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI, resilience = useless in Arena atm.  <br />
<br />
I run boomkin with 500+ resil, takes the average 3's team about 8-10 secs to burn me with a resto druid healing me. (~20-22k HP)<br />
<br />
If you think about it, at lvl 70, your best arena teams had 500-700 resilience, and about 1200-1500 DPS.  At 80, the best arena gear leaves you at about 700ish Resil, and about 2k DPS.<br />
<br />
Good PVE gear = 2500-3500 DPS and just dominates any resilience you have.  ATM, PVE burst wins arena's almost everytime.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
At 70 resil was capped at like 502. More was pointless. The 80 resil cap is somewhere around 1230 (Unobtainable with S5 gear). Not all the gear is out yet.<br />
 <br />
*edit:  and most of the best arena teams in S4 were some variation of 4pc t6 4pc s4 gear (pve / pvp mix).  Oh and Glaives.</div></div><hr />
