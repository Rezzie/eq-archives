 <br />
Otherwise there are quite a few blue quest rewards with good healing stats.<br />

And the S2 set from honer is really good to for a starter.<br />
They are really fine for healing and can last you until SSC/TK.<br />
<br />
Bad thing is, that u would have to do BGs very very much.</div></div><hr />

Aside from BGs, check out wowloot linked above and target the instances and quests you haven't done yet that drop useful loot. If you've only got feral gear at the moment, run as feral for now and collect Feral and Healing gear as it drops.  I certainly feel that it's justifiable to roll on Feral and Healing gear on a run although if there's a Feral/Rogue with us I let them have first pick and only roll if they don't want it, likewise rolling on cloth.<br />
<br />
I picked up The Essence Focuser mace for 40g on the AH,  +227 Healing and 11mp5 is a huge +healing improvement over the staff I've been lugging around for 6 levels or so. And 40g nowadays is 30mins work doing dailies.<br />
<br />
Don't discount cloth drops/quest rewards, especially if no-one else wants it.   Right now if the stats are better than the kit I've got I'll roll on it if no-one minds thanks very much, so I'm running around in a godawful mishmash of leather and cloth but I'm at a much higher +healing level than I would be otherwise.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above don't discount the blue PvP kit from Faction Quartermasters, the Kodohide chest piece was a significant enough upgrade that I use it for PvE and PvP at the moment.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I was using the essence focuser for a while, and just picked up the S2 mace and threw a +81 heal enchant on it.  Increased my healing by roughly 300.</div></div><hr />

I'm on the PvP honour grind, at some point I'm going to have to do WSG though. &quot;Leave the farm alone you retards&quot; also has the capacity to make me want to weep :D</div></div><hr />
