<br />
Crimson, I did that as well, he got back to me saying what Ndainye just said but I put in my message that I had already tried abandoning it.<br />
<br />
Ah well, I'm hoping it will work once the game is released.  *shrug*  <br />

Thanks tho.</div></div><hr />

That pic is no help unless you're a Horde.  They don't have any information up yet on the quest if you're Alliance.<br />
<br />
I'm part of the Alliance and you have to head east of Aberdeen (sp?) to find the cave.  I ran across 2 of those Molkin (sp?) caves pretty close to the town but I kep getting my druid ass kicked by wandering thistle bears and those Molkin also.  I don't think I'm in the right spot.<br />
<br />
I just got this quest earlier today.  My druid is level 10 and the quest is yellow to me which means it shouldn't be THAT difficult to do.  It seems like it should be rated for a higher level.  I've died 5 times wandering around looking for that cave.  The stuff outside in darkshore is level 12+ and it all aggros and kills me.  Does this quest take a group to finish?  Or should I wait until I'm much higher level to try it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I soloed it at 10.  Just be careful and go slowly.  Also make sure you're fully buffed and full HP/mana before you start, Lunaclaw is level 13.<br />

The Alliance one is roughly near here:<br />

I've been in that general area and there a couple of caves there.  I wish I could zoom in closer on that map.  The caves i've found have all of these young molkin things wandering around outside and they all aggro me.  How did you get past them?  Or am I at the wrong spot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the very first cave that is closest to Auberdine.  When you leave town and get to the crossroads immediatly head east.  The cave will have yound moonkins around it.  You gotta kill them to get into the cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Artobro</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">^^^^<br />
<br />
Ok. Thanks.  That's the spot where I've been having trouble.  It seems a little too hard for a level 10 druid to try and take solo.  I keep aggroing level 12 thistle bears that seem to have a huge aggro radius and those young moolkins are around level 12 also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiniane</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think a level 10 druid would be able to solo this quest. I did it at level 12, with a warrior friend to help me. Would probably be soloable at 12 or 13 if you're careful.<br />

Hugs,<br />
Tiniane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend helped me as well.  If you are going to try to solo it I would be sure and take potions along with me and after clearing the outside mobs pull Lunaclaw outside so your root spell will work on him.  We killed him inside and the spawn that guards the mouth of the cave repoped as we were heading out so he seems a pretty quick respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Artobro</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I finally got it but it was because of a group that was at the cave before me.  They cleared out all the trash, killed Lunaclaw and left.  I was waiting around the camp and before everything repopped I ran into the cave sprinkled the dust, killed Lunaclaw and got out before anything repopped.<br />
<br />
Now I just have to learn how to play as this bear form.  I got owned during my first battle as a bear.  I need to figure out this rage meter and when I need to use my special abilities.<br />
<br />
I've also noticed that the difficulty level of the game seems to have really ramped up since I got to Darkshore.  I've died more times within a 10 minute period than I did in my first 3 days of the game total :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">12-04-2004, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darkshore has a lot of aggro mobs for sure.  You'll get the hang of bear.  What I usually do is root and moonfire, wrath, wrath, regen myself and bear form to finish out the fight.  I'm sure everyone has their own thing that works but that's my usual thing on a mob that is likely to give me some trouble :).</div></div><hr />

root, moonfire, starfire, wrath (if root still on), nature's grasp, regen, moonfire, bear form</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to touch up on this again - a level 10 druid can solo Lunaclaw, but it'll be close.  I was able to do it on my first go, but like many here have stated, it's much easier if someone's cleared the outer cave area first.  You can take Lunaclaw, but ironically, the moonkin outside may kill you first.<br />
<br />
If you're doing this at level 10, it wouldn't hurt to have at least a minor healing potion on you.  The only reason I survived was because my heals went through the interruptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimson13</div><div class="date">12-07-2004, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it is possible, i had a lesser heal on me and a pot of fortitude and took lunaclaw at 10 solo on my second try.  First go round I only had a minor health pot and it didn't quite make it for me near th end.  Bring a friend, i'm sure it's much less frustrating :)</div></div><hr />
