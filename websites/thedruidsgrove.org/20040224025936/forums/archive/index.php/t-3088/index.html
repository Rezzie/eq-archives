<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Talisman of Benevolence is nice.<br />
<br />
The weapon with clicky DoT from Ssra is awesome (Sporecaller?), but I'll likely never see one.<br />
<br />
Just a couple off the top of my head.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Again it does come down to your (and your guilds) capability and your level.  If your on Claws of Veeshan faction I recommend the Talisman of Benevolence, it is a &quot;easy&quot; quest with a very nice reward, that can suit every class, this also leads to alot of people doing the quest and a highly contested mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You EP flagged or close to it? If so Blackflame spire (sp? ) and the orb of the sun is nice. First one  drop off frog in Fire and takes about average 30 people to kill him. ( Omg foggies! /lick ) It has right click GRC and is a 7.5 secs cast time iirc. The orb of the sun is off Sol ro.  ( the sexy god ) Has cold nuke focus effect iirc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I currently have Gem of Faith im my range slot.  It is a quest from PoH and pretty simple to get.  NPC for turn in is by Gfay spires.  I also had Fluted Scorpion Stinger for a little while.  It drops off scorps in PoS.  Both are easily attainable with the scorp being easier because it can be solo'd with frog pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loralin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How contested the scout is in WW (trigger for tails of bene quest) really depends on your server.<br />
<br />
I've helped out friends a great deal doing the quest and it's very rare on Bertoxx to not find the scout up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bloodurst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Radiant Feather from PoA if flagged for the EP. 1 groupable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let me add my own question about range suggestions here, please :) <br />
<br />
I currently use a Ceramic Sword of War, which I lusted after for the range IV (because at the time I was getting to heal pullers a lot; not doing that much now).<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if it would be worth while to bag the Sword of War and pick up a Rod of Storms for the Anger of Eci effect?  (and just use the range effect when I need it for that rare occasion... sometimes healing on raids, for example?  it rarely does the shimmer thing under normal circumstances.)<br />
<br />
I'm open to other suggestions, too!!<br />
<br />
Info:  I can also put a golden idol of Tunare there.  CoV hates my guts and has a &quot;wanted&quot; poster of me on the walls of Skyshrine (no talisman of benevolence for this pup).  I'm NOT elemental flagged or VT enabled.<br />
<br />
I group, raid casually, and solo rarely (except to pharm junk for my pottery obsession).<br />
<br />
Thanks!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If it's extended range you want, there's always this, which I used fulltime for quite a while:<br />

Drops from Drornok Tok Vo`Lok in the plane of storms.  Kill all the frogs in the central cave before they start to respawn to trigger him.  Like the minis Drornok doubles for 984 and is unslowable, but every minute or so he spawns 4 adds.  I haven't tried killing him since the charm nerf that prevented pet tanking.  I imagine he should still be two groupable or so?</div></div><hr />
