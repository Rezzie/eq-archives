<br />
Here's a sneak peek at the update notes for Tuesday.  Please note that  this may or may not be modified before the servers officially open back up on  Launch Day.<br />
 <br />
*** Secrets of Faydwer ***<br />
 Welcome to EverQuest Secrets of Faydwer, the 14th expansion for  EverQuest!<br />
<br />
<br />
 The clockwork armies of the evil gnomish necromancer Meldrath the Malignant  gather in the Steamfont Mountains, awaiting his order to invade the kingdom of  Ak'Anon. The launch of his great air fortress Mechanotus has torn open the  earth, exposing new paths into unexplored regions of the ancient continent of  Faydwer.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 Rediscover Faydwer as you adventure in the nearby Loping Plains, home to the  soul eating wereorcs of Bloodmoon Keep. Strive to end the torment of humans and  elves cursed for centuries in the Hills of Shade. All the while, an ancient  menace stirs east of the Dragonscale Hills, where the prismatic dragon Kerafyrm  the Awakened plans his revenge.<br />
<br />
 <br />
 - Level Cap Increase: Players can now achieve level 80. New high level item  sets, new Alternate Advancement ability lines, and new spells will come with  this increase, including a new AA that grants a new spell slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
 - Heroic Items: One aspect of player power is based on the seven physical and  mental attributes of their characters: Agility, Charisma, Dexterity,  Intelligence, Stamina, Strength, and Wisdom.  For player characters that have  reached the maximums for these attributes, equipping normal items with increased  attributes offers no benefit.  Heroic Items feature particular stats that allow  players to go beyond those maximums.  For each point in a heroic stat, the  player gains one point in the statistic and the maximum on that statistic is  increased by one point.  In addition, heroic stats offer benefits beyond the  normal statistics.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Heroic Intelligence: Increases mana pool, mana regen,  and the maximum amount of mana regen a character can have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Heroic Strength:  Increases endurance pool, endurance regen, and the maximum amount of endurance  regen a character can have.  Also increases damage done by melee attacks and  improves the bonus granted to armor class while using a shield.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Heroic  Stamina: Increases hit point pool, hit point regen, and the maximum amount of  hit point regen a character can have.  Also increases endurance pool, endurance  regen, and the maximum amount of endurance regen a character can have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-  Heroic Agility: Increases endurance pool, endurance regen, and the maximum  amount of  endurance regen a character can have.  Also increases the chance to  dodge an attack, grants a bonus to defense skill, and reduces falling  damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Heroic Dexterity: Increases endurance pool, endurance regen, and  the maximum amount of endurance regen a character can have.  Also increases  damage done by ranged attacks, improves chance to successfully assassinate or  headshot, and improves the chance to riposte, block, and parry incoming  attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Heroic Charisma: Improves reaction rolls with some NPCs and  increases the amount of faction you gain or lose when faction is adjusted.<br />
 <br />
<br />
- New Content: There are 15 new realms for adventurers to explore including  Meldrath's maniacal Fortress Mechanotus, the Dragonscale Hills, the Loping  Plains, and Kerafyrm's Lair: Crystallos. Travel through Faydwer solo or with  groups to complete new quests, tasks, events, and raids and to acquire new  items, spells, tradeskill recipes, abilities, and more.<br />
 <br />
*** Live Highlights ***<br />
<br />
<br />
 - Book of Legends: The Book of Legends, a tome that holds the record of those  who have come together to celebrate EverQuest at the SOE Fan Faires, now lives  in the library within Plane of Knowledge.<br />
 - New Loot All Options: &quot;Loot All&quot; functionality has been added to corpses.  This includes a &quot;Loot All&quot; button on the loot window and the ability to  shift-right-click loot a corpse. <br />
 - AC Mitigation Improvements: We modified the AC Caps and over-cap returns  for mitigation for all classes to bring them more in line with their intended  ability to mitigate damage. Warriors, Paladins, Shadowknights, Clerics, and  Monks received a minor increase in their mitigation ability. Rangers, Bards,  Rogues, Shaman, Beastlords, and Berserkers received a moderate increase in their  mitigation ability. Druids, Necromancers, Wizards, Enchanters, and Magicians  received a considerable increase in their mitigation ability.<br />
 - Fog Rendering System Enhancements: An entirely new fog rendering system has  been implemented in the EverQuest graphics engine. This new system is used in  all zones that currently have fog.<br />
 - Multi-core CPU Support: If you have a Multi-core CPU you no longer have to  manually set their processor affinity! EverQuest will automatically assign  itself to an available core. If you run multiple copies of the client, each new  copy running will assign itself to the next available core. Those interested in  customizing which core or cores EverQuest clients run on, check the forums.<br />
 <br />
*** Recently Reported Issues ***<br />
 While some of the other issues that were resolved in this update were  reported via bug reports, here are a few we'd like to highlight.<br />
 Issue: West Display Bug<br />
Summary: When you face west the video geometry  disappears except the UI and the Sky. When you face another direction the issue  goes away. Normally this is only fixed by doing a reboot of your PC or reloading  EQ.<br />
Status:  We have made a change that should reduce the chances of the  &quot;west bug&quot; occurring; unfortunately the change requires us to turn off some  optimizations. If you want to disable this workaround, please add the following  line to your eqclient.ini: DisableWestBugFix=1 (The EQ team would like to thank  Community Member Strommmm for his feedback on helping us with this issue.)<br />
 Issue: Solteris Instability<br />
Summary: Some people have reported that the  Solteris raid zone continuously crashes during raids.<br />
Status: Optimizations  have been put in place to improve stability. We will continue to monitor the  status of this zone and other instanced zones.<br />
 <br />
*** Items ***<br />
 - Prestidigitase, Staurolite, Harmonagate and Taaffeite have been modified to  work in the new jewelcraft system. They will also continue to work in their  original fashion if you prefer the jewelry made that way.<br />
 <br />
*** Spells ***<br />
 - Lesser Summon Corpse, Summon Corpse, Conjure Corpse, and Exhumer's Call  have had their scribe-levels lowered for shadowknights.<br />
- The Bewilderment  line now has an improved resistance modifier.<br />
- Player animations when using  various AE spells and combat abilities now display properly.<br />
- The protection  granted from Shielding Thunder now stacks with Weapon Shield Discipline.<br />
-  The Consecrate Ground line now has a chance to root undead NPCs that enter the  aura's area of effect.<br />
- Recast timers on many mage summon item spells such  as the Phantom Armor line, Aenda's Trinkets line, and Armaments line were  removed.<br />
- Necromancer pet haste now bestows strength and a damage mod.   Upgrades to the line should be improvements under all situations.<br />
- NPC  casters will no longer auto-learn Dispel-type player spells.  <br />
- The Decrepit  Skin, Ward of Tunare, and Skin of the Reptile lines are now limited by the  number of heals / runes bestowed to the buffed player instead of number of hits  scored against the buffed player.  The number of &quot;procs&quot; should be relatively  the same, but no longer random.  These spells will scale down in effectiveness  against lower level NPCs.<br />
- AE spells that use conical or beam areas of  effect now have a hit limit of 8 targets.<br />
- The cleric group complete healing  spell &quot;Word of Redemption&quot; now mimics Complete Heal in that it heals for 7500  and cannot be focused.<br />
- Single-target fire, ice, and magic instant cast  spells from TSS and SoF now share the same recast timer.  The recast delay on  Cloudburst has been decreased so it can be chained.  The Cloudburst line is now  more damaging but less efficient than the - Flashfires and Cold Snap lines.   Recourses from these instant cast spells now bestow a short-duration buff that  applies a damage increase to the next spell with a 3 second cast time or more.   Most other wizard direct damage spells have had their cast times nearly halved  and had this time applied to the reuse delay, allowing the use of 2-3 direct  damage spells in the time that would previously be required to cast one.<br />
 <br />
*** Tradeskills ***<br />
 - There is a new level 80 cultural armor set for all races and level 75 and  80 cultural symbol sets. New quests can be found for level 75 and level 80  quests.  Additionally there are new cultural raid augments to go with the  cultural armor for the Serpent's Spine, the Buried Sea, and Secrets of  Faydwer.<br />
- Jewelry Making has evolved to a new method. Now jewelry makers  will make base pieces of jewelry and gems that can be put in this jewelry for  different effects.  This will allow people to get jewelry customized for their  needs. <br />
- Practitioners of spell research will no longer need to use runes,  words and pages.  Instead, they can use the systematic spell research system to  make all spells previously made with these materials.<br />
- Within one of the  newly discovered areas of Faydwer you will be able to find a gnome who wants a  measure of revenge.<br />
- A discovery has been made and now Gem Studded Chains  are less difficult to make.<br />
 <br />
*** AA ***<br />
 - Harm Touch and Lay on Hands have been reworked. Changes to how these  abilities work will enable us to more easily adjust and tune these abilities.  The primary change you will notice is that both of these abilities have been  changed from innate skills to the AA system. For the first 10 ranks of these new  AAs you will automatically gain the next rank as you level up - you won't need  to purchase the AAs. Starting at level 51 you can continue to increase the power  of your ability by purchasing new ranks of AAs. These roughly correspond to some  of the previous AAs that existed for either ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
 All previous functionality for these abilities has been turned off. All AAs  based on focusing these abilities have either been refunded and replaced with  new AAs or have been modified to work with the new abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
 - Refunded the Harm Touch AAs as part of the changes to how Harm Touch  operates.<br />
- Refunded the AA &quot;Improved Lay on Hands&quot; as part of the changes to  how Lay on Hands functions.<br />
- Corrected an issue with the Flurry line of AA's  that was causing them to trigger up to 94 percent of the time on a successful  triple-attack, instead of up to the intended 30 percent.<br />
 <br />
*** Zones ***<br />
 - Fixed an issue with Halls of Honor where NPCs were dropping the incorrect  item for the Hot Zone quests.<br />
 <br />
*** UI ***<br />
 - Corrected a few typos and errors with a few of the UI windows.<br />
- Added  &quot;Claims&quot; option to the EQ menu button which toggles the Claim Window.<br />
- Made  a few minor adjustments to the claims window.<br />
- Added a slider/ctrl to loot  slots with stacks. Shift-/Ctrl- semantics work with this functionality.<br />
 - Changed -<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">11-13-2007, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Reptile changes...<br />
<br />
I covered this a bit on my NDA post, but will repeat it here.<br />
<br />
Defensive proc buffs, which allow you to avoid or heal damage have been altered.<br />
<br />
I am using Reptile as my example.<br />
<br />
Reptile could proc on any of 120 swings.  This limit was created to provide the right number of procs verus one single target.  The issue however, was the more things swinging at you, the more procs you got - which drastically increased the healing power of the spell, to the point you in some situations became nearly unkillable.<br />
<br />
This, was not intended.<br />
<br />
These changes did not go out with TSS, but it would appear they finally got the code working.<br />
<br />
Reptile (both versions) now have the same limits.<br />
<br />
12 Proc counter:  Reptile can proc 12 times, then fades.<br />
Downward scaling:   Reptile will proc less often, if you are tanking lower content.<br />
<br />
I will say, this was primarily a Knight issue, who abused the swing counter to solo raid level mobs, but we get nerfed by extension since our spell functions the same way.<br />

Rashere forgot the heroic wisdom score mods =(   <br />
<br />
Ah heck.  You're right.  Copy the Intelligence once, call it Wisdom, and note that it has the same effect for wis-based casters as int does for int-based casters.  I'll get the patch notes updated later.<br />
