I was wondering if anyone knows of any chest items in the higher end (or even lower end I guess) that have a robe graphic that are Druid wearable.  I know I have seen a few, but cannot think of the names.<br />
 <br />
I would love to confuse a lot of people by wearing a robe and I think it would be a very unique look :popcorn:</div></div><hr />

If I remember right, humans are the only ones who have a robe graphic.</div></div><hr />

Or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
That being said I believe there is a poor stats robe that drops in skyshrine that is all all. Guardian Robe or something like that maybe, not sure.</div></div><hr />

At least it used to, I'm not sure if it drops in the revamped VP.  The stats are actually decent and can be overlooked until you get into PoTime or GoD.<br />

I've done some research on this matter, as I'm a Human Druid who loves robes.  :biggrin:   I'm currently wearing a Crystal Covered Shroud next to my EP loot, lol.  We don't get many options.<br />

<br />
Guardian Robe (www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3912) is the right one Ex, thanks :D <br />
 <br />
Why would I want the robe graphic even though I am not an INT caster (though that makes no difference really ... Monks are not casters at all and wear robe graphics on more than a few items)? Because, like I said, I like the look and want to mess with people by wearing the robe and casting spells that most INT casters cannot :assimilat :dance:</div></div><hr />

When you are under an illusion like dark elf one, can you use robe that are tagged as: all class and races; dark elf?<br />
Now that would kinda rock... Im gonna try that out after raid but i doubt it</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Hauberk of Harmony is not robe, but kick ass graphics (http://www.eqfashion.com/gallery.php?id=2091).<br />
 <br />
Robe of the Nexus (White) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=33862) &amp; Robe of the Nexus (Black) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=33863) may also be robe (would sure hope so) but do they drop still?<br />

All I can seem to see for a Half Elf DRU from an Allak search of DRU-HalhElf-Chest...</div></div><hr />
