<br />
When I first got to Shat and encountered another player hovering over the city on a Nether Wray I thought &quot;I don't care what it takes, I'm gonna GET me one of those!&quot;  And every day since, I've strolled along the treetops with the Skettis Prisoner.  :wink:  <br />
<br />
Complete and total waste of money.  BUT, he matches my gear and, we look good together. :tongue: <br />
<br />
Anyone else make a purchase simply for the &quot;cool factor&quot;?<br />
<br />
Nether drake!  Here I come! :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

Tauren on Ram ftw!<br />
<br />
Then my guildies on that realm drifted away and for the most part stopped playing  WoW. :-(<br />
<br />
Someday I'll have one of each for my different 70s: A Skyguard Ray for my Hunter -he's almost there already-, a Nether Drake for my Pally, and the CE Hippogryph for my druid.  The hard part will be deciding on color. :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I couldn't be bothered to do the event and someone was selling it.<br />
<br />
I like collecting rare pets though.<br />
<br />
I have a Magical Crawdad, Peanut, Sinister Squashling, The Brewfest Pet and Peddlefeet!<br />
<br />
Still need Mojo and can't wait for the new Fishing Daily crocodile pets in the next patch!</div></div><hr />

Not really the same I know but I bought Terrestian's Stranglestaff (with DKPs) from Ilihoof in Karazhan - despite having a better weapon - and enchanted it with Savagery, so that I could have tentacles dripping with blood.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
Also I once paid 5g for a Farmer's Shovel (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3334)...<br />
