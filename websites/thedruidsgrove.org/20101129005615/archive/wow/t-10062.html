<br />
I like Lum, I always have liked Lum.  I've met Scott several times at various gaming gatherings, he's a good guy.  But man don't try to fix other peoples games when you can't fix your own.  End game DAoC with the oodles of player driven character development is as riddled with controversy between casual and hard core as every other MMO is.  End game development is HARD there's never gonna be an answer that works for everyone, and the only thing that will stop it is when some developer has the guts to tell a percentage of their audience &quot;sucks to be you&quot;, which will never happen.</div></div><hr />
