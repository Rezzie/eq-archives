 STEP ONE: FORAGE SICKLY MAIDEN'S HAIR<br />
 <br />
 If You Have Epic 1.0 and are level 60 or up, forage Sickly Maiden's Hair in Rathe Mts.  <br />
 <br />
 Then go talk to Althele along the south shore in Eastern Karana:<br />
 <br />
[Wed Sep 15 16:22:33 2004] Althele says 'Hello, friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally, but lately? I sense that something is [out of balance].'<br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:22:34 2004] You say, 'out of balance'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:22:35 2004] Althele says 'I am certain that you would sense it too, had you been so blessed as to be without sight. My sense of the life of Norrath is greatly heightened without the hindrance of vision. As I can sense that you have at your call the power of the lands, perhaps in the form of the Nature Walkers Scimitar. I can feel an unnatural illness creeping about the edges of Norrath. Please, if you come across anything suspicious bring it to me. I am worried about this cold sickness that I can almost taste. Go with the blessing of the Mother and the speed of the Storm, my child.'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:22:52 2004] You say, 'Sickly Maiden's Hair foraged in RM to Althele'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:22:52 2004] Althele says 'Please, let me see this plant.'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:23:47 2004] Althele says 'This plant is certainly ill. I've never sensed such a disease. You should take this to Niera in Surefall. She has been studying diseases ever since her mother's tragic death from disease. She may be able to find something out about what has affected that plant. Help her in any way you can.'<br />
 <br />
 A Tuft of Sickly Maiden's Hair is returned.  Item Lore says &quot;This sample of long, golden grass is tinged with disease&quot;<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 STEP TWO: GET WATERPROOF COLLECTION BAG<br />
 <br />
 Gate to SFG and find Niera Farbreeze, right behind Ranger Rick HQ along the water's eastern edge (107, -192)<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:37:36 2004] You say, 'Hail, Niera Farbreeze'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:37:42 2004] You say, 'Tuft of Sickly Maiden's Hair'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:37:42 2004] Niera Farbreeze says 'Please, let me see this Maiden's Hair. It's a common enough plant and they suffer from many diseases.'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:37:52 2004] Niera Farbreeze says 'Well, this is certainly new to me. It's hard to tell if this is a real concern, though. Diseases of all sorts exist in the world and we can't make every one of them a priority. But then perhaps I spend too much time thinking about it. Some great druids and scholars have told me that diseases can start out as helpful things, like parasite fish that clean other fish. But sometimes they change and become harmful. Sometimes they are trying to be helpful but cause harm because they are trying to clean the wrong kind of things off the fish. They've told me that this is just the way that life tries out new things to see if they work. That might be true, but I don't believe it. Tunare isn't that cruel. And I know at least one god that is.'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:41:14 2004] Niera Farbreeze says 'See if you can find other infected plants or any other evidence of this infection. If you can find enough of them, you may be able to see a pattern. It should spread out from one point. Knowing the first location might help me a lot in trying to discover what this gunk started out as, which parasite fish it is, so-to-speak. Here, take this bag. Put the diseased plants and other evidence you find in here. Make sure you remember where you found them. Keep the bag with you at all times on your search, you never know when you will come across some evidence of value. When you think you have enough to see a pattern, seal up the bag and bring it back to me and let me know what you've found.'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:41:21 2004] You say, 'Waterproof Collection Bag'<br />
 <br />
 [Wed Sep 15 16:41:30 2004] Item Lore: Made from thickly woven reeds.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 STEP THREE: HANDFUL OF DISEASED MAIDEN'S HAIR<br />
 Go to Lake of Ill Omens. 3 Bloodgill Foragers (dark blue cons) spawn approx. every four hours under the dome in the center of the lake (-663, -424). You can get under the dome at the south edge of the dome, right along the bottom. The mobs have substantial HP, but only hit for 15 or so. Two snare, one does not. The latter drops a Handful of Diseased Maiden's Hair.<br />
 <br />
 STEP FOUR: BAGFUL OF DISEASED MAIDEN'S HAIR [GOBLIN DISGUISE]<br />
 <br />
 Go to Frontier Mts. If you are lucky, there will be a number of Goblin Hiders on track. They teleport periodically from hiding spot to hiding spot, which typically are under trees, in ravines, etc., where they are hard to spot. Best strategy is to find one such spot and wait for them to show up (one spot is close to the LOIO zone line under a tree branch). As noted below, a real Goblin Hider (not a fake) will drop a Bagful of Diseased Maiden's Hair.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 If you don't see any Goblin Hiders, then you will need to trigger the Goblin Disguise event.<br />
 <br />
 Find Finrin Talister near BW zone (-2198.29, 1476.26)<br />
 <br />
 Finrin Talister says 'Well met, Wood Elf. What brings you to this [legendary site]? I hope that you're here to do something about all these pesky [goblins].'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'goblins'<br />
 <br />
 Finrin Talister says 'They've been a real problem lately. Not that they aren't always a problem, but there was all this commotion about some sort of contest with a prize a while ago. It seems that they've [forgotten] it again for the moment, thank goodness.'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'forgotten'<br />
 <br />
 Finrin Talister says 'Yes, forgotten. They forget about this contest for a while, then suddenly one of them remembers. Fights break out for a while over who will win the [prize] then they forget again until the next one remembers it. I wish they'd have this contest already and get it over with.'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'prize'<br />
 <br />
 Finrin Talister says 'I don't know for sure what the prize is, I don't speak goblin all that well. All I know is that they discovered something on some poor [victim] that they desire. I'm not certain that they even know what it is from the way they talk about it.'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'victim'<br />
 <br />
 Finrin Talister says 'I don't know who it was, just someone that they caught sneaking into or out of Droga. You know, I'm tempted to dress up like a goblin and insist that they start the contest already, just so it will be over and we can go back to the relative peace and quiet I've learned to enjoy out here.'<br />
 <br />
 HOW TO MAKE THE GOBLIN DISGUISE:<br />
 <br />
 Green Body Paint<br />
 0.5 small<br />
 All All<br />
 non-stacking<br />
 Lore: Green Body Paint-<br />
 <br />
 Combine in brew barrel:<br />
 Cactus pulp -foraged in North Ro<br />
 Water flask<br />
 Lichenclover-foraged or looted in Frontier Mts, Field of Bone or FV<br />

 62830-Copper Armband-drops from Goblin whipcrackers in FM<br />
 62831-Carved Wooden Mask- goblin whipcrackers<br />
 62832-Green Face Paint -(Brewed, trivial 15)<br />
 62833-Goblin Loincloth - goblin whipcrackers<br />
 <br />
 Poor Goblin Disguise Recipe:<br />
 Green goblin skin - goblin whipcrackers, or any goblin<br />
 2 copper armbands<br />
 carved wooden mask<br />
 goblin loincloth<br />
 green body paint<br />
 <br />
 Triv is 15, you can combine the recipe in the PoK loom.<br />
 <br />
 TO START THE CONTEST IN FM:<br />
 Go to the entrance to Droga.<br />
 The time must be night in game (7pm to 7am)<br />
 Put on the goblin disguise.<br />
 Say &quot;Start the contest&quot; (in goblin)<br />
 <br />
 There will be several emotes which I hope to post here when someone passes it on, then a few moments later the new goblins start to spawn.<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:38:30 2004] You say, 'Start the contest'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:38:31 2004] a goblin whipcracker shouts, in Goblin, 'You right! Me want prize! Start contest! King Dronan owe us contest!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:38:31 2004] a goblin whipcracker says 'Oh look..a talking lump of refuse..how novel!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:42:13 2004] Whip Cracker Garzul shouts, in Goblin, 'Gather! Servants of Dronan gather!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:42:40 2004] Whip Cracker Garzul shouts, in Goblin, 'Hurry it up! You no want Garzul to come get you!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:45:59 2004] Goblin King Dronan shouts, in Goblin, 'Ever since Glerbag found prize on intruder all of you keep bothering King Dronan with crying about who owns it. Gorta killed Glerbag, so Gorta says it's his. Then Bittersmell and One-eye both say they killed Gorta and it is theirs. So I kill Bittersmell and One-eye and declare that there will be a contest and the winner will get it. For a while you shut up and I am happy.'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:46:29 2004] Goblin King Dronan shouts, in Goblin, 'Now Stinkbelly remembers contest and all you start to bother me again. I smarter than you, I know this not going to help. But if it shut you up for a few days, then I declare today the day of the contest!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:46:38 2004] Goblin Seeker shouts, in Goblin, 'I will win the prize and I'm going to eat it!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:46:38 2004] Goblin Seeker shouts, in Goblin, 'King Dronan rules!'<br />
 [Mon Sep 20 15:47:05 2004] Goblin King Dronan shouts, in Goblin, 'Contest start now!'<br />
 <br />
 Wait for &quot;Goblin Hider&quot;. (Confirmed Loc-3097, 472, but seem to be everywhere) If you attack the wrong one, he says he's the wrong one and that you have the wrong hider. Goblin Hiders that drop the bag will say nothing. <br />
 <br />
 Loot &quot;A Bag of Diseased Maiden's Hair&quot;<br />
 <br />
 [b]<br />
 [u]STEP FIVE: SOGGY MAIDEN'S HAIR[/u][/b]<br />
 <br />
 Go to Eastern Wastes, south west corner of the zone, just south of kael zonein.<br />
 Look for Ulthork Raider (lv 66) and two &quot;an ulthork man o' war&quot; (all dark blue cons). Respawn is approx. 70-90 min. They despawn if aggroed them, then evac, die, etc., and dont re-aggro them in time.<br />
 They roam the south west area.  The two MoWs can be rooted and killed, as they have relatively low HP.  <br />
 <br />
 Ulthork Raider is snareable and rootable, but summons. Hits for somewhere in the 700s.<br />
 <br />
 Loot Carved Prexus Totem (does not always drop)<br />
 Item Lore: Carved from the tusk of an Ulthork.<br />
 <br />
 Go to Cobalt Scar, find Blumblum Swigwater (235, 480)<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'Hail, Blumblum Swigwater'<br />
 Blumblum Swigwater says 'I am very busy. Thank you for taking the time to speak to me, stranger, but I have no time for talk right now. I'm afraid that your business can not be urgent enough.'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'what is the problem'<br />
 Blumblum Swigwater says 'I appreciate your warm concern strange one, but the Othmir will handle this ourselves. I am certain that it would be below you to take on such troubles, especially when I have only a paltry few sentences of information to trade for it. That is, unless this is seems like a [fair deal] to you, for who am I to judge such a noble, if unusually depilated, creature such as yourself.'<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'what fair deal'<br />
 Blumblum Swigwater eyes light up and he smiles warmly. 'Such a kind offer! As you may know, we Othmir are exceptional carvers, though it is at brewing that we excel. Our carvings are made from many things, but most commonly of the gruesome teeth of those disgusting Ulthork. We create these beautiful carvings in tribute to our lord Prexus. Turning the ugly teeth of our enemies into items of worship provides several layers of irony and amusement that we can not resist.<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'what carving'<br />
 Blumblum Swigwater says 'The Ulthork raid our homes when they become desperate. We always push them back, of course. But lately there has been one of there kind that is unusually powerful and he has managed to breach our defenses by force or trickery. They steal food and kill our young, as they always do. This one, though, is unusual in that he has taken one of our carvings. This concerns us, for we had not thought the beasts smart enough to recognize the irony in what we have done with their tusks. Our concern is that this one may be able to recognize the carving for what it is and will use it to incite his people to be more trouble that they usually are. If you can recover that carving as evidence that this beastly Ulthork is dispensed with, I will gladly share with you what we have seen of sickness in our waters.'<br />
 <br />
 Give Carved Prexus Totem to Blumlum<br />
 <br />
 Blumblum Swigwater says 'Wonderful! You are indeed a creature of your word. Not only have you defeated an enemy of the Othmir, but you have returned to us this most precious statue. I thank you. It is unfortunate that the only thing I have to give you in return is some information and a small fish.'<br />
 <br />
 You recieve Small Trigger Fish<br />
 Item Lore: Small, brightly colored fish.<br />
 <br />
 You say, 'what rumors'<br />
 Blumblum Swigwater says 'I hate to repeat such rudeness, but as you insist. Some of my people witnessed a hairless-one swimming from the grotto just before the first sickness was seen. Of course many of your people come swimming out of the grotto, so I would give it little thought. Some of my people have decided that it must have been that hairless swimmer that cause the illness. They say, and forgive me for repeating this, that the skin of your people is poison in the water, that you expose it because it defends you in such ways. Obvious foolishness, I apologize for repeating it.'<br />
 <br />
 Go to Abysmal Sea, buy a Gutting Knife from Tasec Dreen (use Find tool)<br />
 Item Lore: Has a thin blade for cleaning fish.<br />
 <br />
 Combine Small Trigger Fish and Gutting Knife in a Tackle Box<br />
 <br />
 You recieve Soggy Maiden's Hair<br />
 Item Lore: This plant is not aquatic and has traces of a sticky film.<br />
 <br />
 <br />

Hailed Althele ... got the message...checked track..DB con to me at 66...named Devlon Knacknabber attacks..says &quot;Gah, you found me. No matter, this will be the last time you see me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dont remember this mob around..not listed..summons, triples at least for 658. I used exodus, being unbuffed.... Buffed went back..he disappeared from track. Conincedence? maybe..interesting though.<br />
<br />
 Just killed that Drevlon guy you mentioned, he dropped a &quot;Redblade Family Sword&quot; no drop, all/all, lore<br />
<br />
easily rootable, killed using dots..gonna try giving to Althete<br />
<br />
item lore: An heirloom placed on the graves of Redblades.<br />
<br />
edit: Althete doesnt accept it, maybe for a different epic or quest<br />
<br />
 Devlon Knacknabber was up without me talking to Athele<br />
<br />
<br />
He might be an unrelated spawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Small update.<br />
<br />
2 other Druids and myself decided to attack the dire griffon. It cannot be snared or rooted (no changes to run speed). we just fotted it and kited it around.<br />
<br />
At 80% health, it despawned and a &quot;Plains dragon&quot; spawned. Yellow con to lvl 66. Indifferent and didnt respond to hails. We didn't attack it.</div></div><hr />

thought that too but can't deny more of the hair was found in loio ... Neira responds to the link as well (though she won't take it).   Might be the source is kunark and somehow spread out over to RM. <br />
 <br />
One thing too... think we should be looking more towards mobs with names that indicate those mobs work the lands, like forager/harvester than looking for more gobbies.   The idea being you're looking for evidence of the infection,  mobs are finding it for you and you're borrowing it from them :)</div></div><hr />

It does sound like there could be a link there (we know there was corruption there already, after all), and if we're looking for mobs that have come across it (eg. the LoIO goblin), perhaps the best places to look are zones that have corrupted mobs and also mobs likely to find things rather than just animals (eg. Orcs in EF?). The waterproof bag already seems to have been useful on the goblins, and maybe there's a siren in Kedge who's stumbled across something...

also someone raised a good point: items are being found in same area as our first epic ( thou i'm sure that won't remain the case). we had corrupted giant in rathe mountains, we had the atethle ( bah can't spell name right ) for the corrupted de spawn in ek , we had the locket part of epic in surefall , we had corrupted barricuda in Loio. <br />

 I think that the item that was found from the goblins needs to be put into the bag as part of the specimens to seal within it. ? which is probably why surefall girl makes note of it's importance but won't accept it. <br />

 <br />
They are Bloodgill Foragers, not goblins :). There are goblins out there as well and always have been with the introduction of  Veksar, with the bonus of the name similarities aka. Handful of Diseased Maiden Hair vs. Sickly Maiden Hair...seems to be highly linked :). The location of them is neg 679, neg 440, neg 222. The neg 222 is the depth. Look for the crack it will seem so small but youll fit :)</div></div><hr />

There are three spawn but two are rootable... one is immune to snare and root.  This is the one you need to kill to get the drop.  Respawn time is very long.<br />
 <br />
Of another note, I identified the &quot;Handful of Diseased Maiden's Hair&quot; and the item lore is &quot;Wet and sickly looking plant.&quot;  fits right in with the quest text as far as I am concerned.  Now I'm hunting in nearby zones to LoIO to see what mobs there are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rath Mountains: <br />
epic 1 - corrupted hill giant <br />
epic 2 - foraged hair<br />
<br />
Lake of ill omen :<br />
epic 1 - corrupted barracuda in water.<br />
epic 2 - lock of hair from mob in water. ( near corrupted spawn ?)<br />
<br />
More than a coincidence in my books.<br />
<br />
So where else from epic one is there, particualarly in ref to this 'water' theme.<br />
Epic 1 - swamp of no hope ( that was ulup )<br />
Epic 1 - Kedge ( seahorse - although folks looked there quite a bit already )<br />
Epic 1 - Lake rathetear ( the goblin )<br />
<br />
Questionable - <br />
Epic 1 - Oot ( arguable but water all about it as per zone name- cyclops )<br />
Epic 1 - Innothule Swamp ( foraged mushrooms ).<br />
<br />
Then obviuosly was quite a bit of action in Tim deep......<br />
<br />
To me that should be the places to start killing things / foraging.<br />
<br />
On a random note, everfrost was a place for 2 items in epic 1, the chilled tundra ( forage ) and corrupted mammoth.  May be a place to just scout about again for stuff out of the ordinary.<br />

Have had no luck with the foragers in LOIO, mostly cause they have been camped :) Oh the joy of camping spawns.... /sarcasm<br />

I haven't tried the spiroc harvesters, but I did check around other zones. There are new npcs in Cobalt Scar. One was an ogre with the last name of Greenthumb, which seemed like it could be right. BUT, when I got to her, she was dubious and I was attacked so really didn't get much time to hail or anything.<br />
<br />
I checked out Siren's Grotto while I was in the area. I never spent much time in SG so not familiar with what should or shouldn't be there as far as named or normal mobs :(<br />
<br />
I also went to Swamp of No Hope. Only thing I found was a dire leech, which I am taking a huge guess here that it's for beast, shaman or maybe even ranger epic. Nothing else was around that aroused my suspisions... same for EJ and TT. Nothing all that interesting or new.<br />

I checked out Everfrost, but again, didn't find anything new or interesting. <br />

But what I'm curious about.. is everyone is looking for stuff to kill. Have people started foraging in every zone, and looking for ground spawns? Underwater, above water, everywhere?

Also talk of knowing at least 1 God that would do such a thing.  Perhaps look in the zones protected / watched over by evil Gods.  PoNB? Fear? Hate? CT?  Perhaps sewers in CT?  Innothule swamp?  That is near RM.</div></div><hr />

We know that a parasite fish lives in sea cucumbers. But in conchs?<br />
<br />
 <br />
  A cardinal fish commonly lives in close association with the conch, entering its mantle cavity. Often there are several fish associated with a single conch. The relation has long been known, and this particular cardinal fish is called, appropriately, the conch fish, Apogon (Apogonichthys) stellatus. The fishes that live in the sea cucumbers are pearl fishes (family Carapidae) a family related to the cusk-eels.<br />
<br />
A common pest and an external parasite of stripers is the Pacific lamprey. This parasite fish, eel-like in appearance, with a horny sucking disc surrounding its mouth, attaches itself to the sides of bass and sucks body fluids. When it releases itself, or is rubbed off, it leaves a round, circular wound about an inch in diameter.<br />
Beast Name: Venomous Lamprey, Location: Swamp of No Hope. ...<br />
kill Lamprey in the Swamp and in Firiona Vie for:<br />
<br />
A Venomous Parchment<br />
<br />
It is a note (You can't read it though). It indentifies as a Venomous Parchment (Oh well...).<br />

Youre the little parasite fish that rides along on the big old shark or the bird that stands on the head of the hippo and, basically, youre just there as a small fry, which a lot of us are.</div></div><hr />

I just googled &quot;Maiden's hair&quot; and it's a water plant commonly put in aquariums. It seems odd to find an aquatic plant in Rathe Mtns, but it's bordered by a giant lake and the Feerott has a river flowing through it. It definitely explains goblins underwater in LoIO finding it.<br />
<br />
Chlorodesmis is a green filamentous algae whose appearance is similar to thin blades of grass or tufts of hair. Its common names include Maiden's Hair Plant and Turtle Grass. It contains a toxic substance which deters herbivorous fish from eating it. However, hermit crabs may consume this plant if there is insufficient algae present in the aquarium.</div></div><hr />

It's hard to tell if this is a real concern, though. Diseases of all sorts exist in the world and we can't make every one of them a priority. But then perhaps I spend too much time thinking about it. Some great druids and scholars have told me that diseases can start out as helpful things, like parasite fish that clean other fish. But sometimes they change and become harmful. Sometimes they are trying to be helpful but cause harm because they are trying to clean the wrong kind of things off the fish. They've told me that this is just the way that life tries out new things to see if they work. That might be true, but I don't believe it. Tunare isn't that cruel. And I know at least one god that is.'   <br />
What I think she was referring to with the first part of that is I forget the word for it but there are different types of parasites... some just leech others leech to the benefit of the host (think there was one more but I forget now).   She seems to be talking about the later, like someone mention those fish that suction onto sharks and eat the extra lil bits and keep him clean or those birds that eat stuff off of hippos that would otherwise act as irritants.  The theory she's talking about though seems to be a god (should be Bert, Inny or CT) has corrupted those things so they're not longer doing anything helpful but instead doing something that consequentially harms them.   ie: instead of cleaning the larger animals they could be leaving something on them that's harmful to them.</div></div><hr />

Talk to Althele (sp) the girl you start Epic 1.0 with, if you have epic 1.0 she talks to you , i have mine so i dont know what happens if you dont :) . she tells you to go look for disease, you forage some maidens hair in Rathe Mts. I forget the exact name. Take it back to her, she directs you to Nedira in SFG. Give her the peice Althele gave back to you and she gives you a 4 slot bag . In this bag you are gonna put diseased plants or evidence of this disease. We havent figured this part out yet - but the channel i am using is /join serverwide.druid:druid . we know that the first part is in loio - near veksar, its a Goblin forager or something of that nature, 3 of them spawn, all drk blue to lvl 65 but i heard they are easy to kite with dots and nuke and can be rooted and snared, all except 1. I think thats the one that drops the peice we need. im doin this part right now as i type this post. only 1 of the 3 drop the peice you need so be careful, others might try to yoink your spawn :) I hope this helped someone :) <br />

The plants we've been finding are diseased and they're probably water-influenced.  I doubt they'd be making people be elemental-flagged to finish epic 1.5 so that rules out Plane of Water, imo.  Perhaps Plane of Disease might be a decent place to start searching for some center of corruption?  I'm also going to start searching in Plane of Storms because of that &quot;corruption&quot; mob, and remember Karana (druid god) was corrupted into the form of Agnarr.  <br />

I would suggest looking in the water in WL. <br />
Also do you have to have the bag physically on you? I camped Bloodgill Foresters for 3 hours without them spawning, next day I checked LOIO and no foresters up, went to Surefall got my bag, went to LOIO and no Foresters up, but when I went into water close to Veksar all off a sudden had them on track.<br />
Could be coincidence, or maybe they only spawn if a watertight bag is near? Would mean foraging or looking for groundspawn useless unless carrying the bag.<br />
Would be neat idea actually since would stop other classes from killing mobs / removing ground spawns and insuring druids would actually end up with items.<br />

Derrick Goodroot says ' Yes, Potameids.  Water Nymphs. They gaurd the river.  Legend has it that long ago the Unkempt asked their queen to prvent intruders from crossing the river and entering the unkempt woods.  The queen agreed and now to this day everyone that gets close to the river is seldom heard from again.  Why don't you go take a look already and leave me alone'<br />

Derrick Goodroot says ' You actually found it. It has a new cover, but most of the original pages seem to be here. I can't read all of this very well. Nobody reads this language anymore, but I think I understand the basics. You will need some high quality loam and some magic earth. Marshes are a good place to find the loam. Magical soil might be a problem, but certainly you can find some that will work. These two items are used to create the cleansing loam. It's the third item that I don't like. The ritual seems to say that you must take the seed and insert it into the heart of a noble creature to give it strength, then rest that in the loam and earth. I don't like the idea of killing anything noble for such a ritual. I'm not sure what I think of this whole thing now. I'll leave that up to you. Here is a pot that you can use for the ritual. If you still want to do this and you find a heart that might work, bring it to me and I'll see if I can help.<br />

Just had a thought... I was reading around sites and noticed the race of Dragorns (OoW-specific race) is described as noble... maybe one of them is corrupted or something and we need to take it's heart.  Just a thought... I haven't been to OoW yet (can't get the expansion until next week) so I don't know what the Dragorns are like yet... but maybe we have to kill a corrupted one or something... as a link to the new expansion.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Older item (May of 2004?) so might not be for the quest, but maybe it just wasnt used back then and they changed it so it is now /shrug.<br />
<br />
Other than that, almost every new mob from GoD/OoW drops a heart of their own kinds (kyv heart, Ukun heart, etc..), same with many other mobs.<br />
<br />
Other idea is the heart of one of those dragons, but then again epic1.5 is supposed to be 1 group doable?  and those dragons dont seem to be 1 groupable dragons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Waterproof Collection bag is designed to have a pattern. the NPC specifically mentions a pattern. I've already seen a pattern. Didn't you notice how Rathe Mountains had a forage of tainted hair, then the Lake right next to it had a mob that was infested and dropped a related item. <br />
 <br />
I believe the key is getting back to foraging diseased items, then finding a infected mob in a nearby zone. since the actual looted item started it, I'll bet anything, there are 4 forages, and 4 loots. The loots complete the bag. Since its Waterproof, theres a good bet that the mobs are water mobs (fish-so-to-speak).<br />
 <br />
Another idea is that the combineable is the actual foraged items. Perhaps the mob is a starting place for us to begin searching nearby zones for forages. It is a collection bag, so perhaps just the forages make the combine.<br />

But they had animals i know of in  veksar - which is right next to loio where we found our first handful of maidens hair :D , They also had mobs in droga, velks, Cazic thule, SG i think, im not sur eon the complete list . join serverwide.ranger:ranger to find out their zones and maybe it will lead us somewhere.

 <br />
 Also a second possibility... Ever think that the thing that grows from the  ritual could actually be the epic... I mean it is a stretch, but what about the art of the druid epic...

Killed it and got the normal rat whiskers and Scalded Rat Skin *no drop*..been standing here now for almost an hour foraging and still another has not spawned or showing up on track..seeing as this is off Rathe Mnts and the &quot;ripple&quot; effect and the fact its not the Alla beastiary nor no others around the zone its got bells going off as a possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendan</div><div class="date">09-18-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, got a couple of theories here, if you can contradict or correct anything about them I would appriciate it.  First is that I found some Green River Sludge on the bottom of the river in Feerrott.  This may be something to go in the collection bag, leading us from RM to Feerrott.  I found nothing in Innothule (yet) and that got me thinking about CT and Oggok.  What if the disease comes from PoFear (maybe has something to do with the new Verm Guardian?) and was developed or passed through the temple?  Since I'm not high level enough to go looking for ground spawns in the temple I wasn't able to explore, so anyone travelling to CT please keep an eye to the ground.  In the other direction, perhaps the disease was concocted by the ogres in Ogguk?  I looked around a bit but couldn't find any evidence, but it may be something to keep in mind.  That's about all I have to add atm, I really think that given how simple it was to find the hair and get the pouch that this step of the quest should be centered around RM like Niera said.</div></div><hr />

 I turned in the Tuft of diseased hair to Niera Fairbreeze in Surefall Glad and she didnt give it back. So now im wondering if we need the Tuft of Diseased Maiden's Hair AND the Handfull of Diseased Maiden's Hair for the bag...<br />

<br />
A few thoughts I had:<br />
<br />
Firstly, I was wondering if anyone's tried saying to Niera Farbreeze &quot;It starts in The Feerott&quot; or something along those lines yet.  I haven't logged on yet, so I'll try that in a bit.  My theory is that she wanted an idea of where it went... if we give her that info, maybe she'll give us clues where to find the 4 pieces to stick in the Waterproof bag (which, btw, is a 4 slot container that looks like a wristpouch, and can only hold small items).  I'd suggest naming zones near Rathe Mountains... Lake Rathetear, South Karana, The Feerott, Oggok, Temple of Cazic-Thule, Pleane of Fear, Innothule Swamp...  The Feerott/Oggok/CT/PoFear seems likely to be one of the answers as it's the most idealistic BUT if the answer is close to South Karana/Lake Rathe... then the infection could be rooted as far as Qeynos... heck, even from Surefall Glade... *maybe* from the Unkempt Druids in Jaggedpine Forest.  Let's not forget on the Norrathean World map, the area north of Qeynos is dubbed &quot;Unkempt Woods&quot; ... so, my theory there is that the people of those woods (JPF in actual zone terms) and the unkempt druids in Rathe Mountains are somehow connected in this part... there was a mentioning of Althele or Niera saying that they think they're doing good, but they're actually doing bad... I forget the whole quote.  So, maybe that's all connected and the actual root of the problem is out of Qeynos or Surefall Glade, or Jaggedpine Forest.  There again, it could be anywhere lol.<br />
<br />
Secondly, and yes, I do talk a lot when I have something to say... I've had all night to think... secondly, I feel the idea of finding something noble... Lions are noble creatures, so maybe we have to kill a specific lion in The Karanas.  OR thinking in terms of throwing us into OoW zones... The Noble's Causeway is a zone name, so maybe something specific is there that we need to kill (let's call it 'cleanse' cuz druids don't kill lol).<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's what I was thinking... and probably more... I'll investigate some tonight<br />
<br />
Take care~</div></div><hr />

What does Lucy know that we don't know??? lol.  Actually, yes, this is a question... is it absolutely confirmed that talking to Althele does indeed start the epic 2.0... or perhaps we thought that because we stumbled upon her first?  Cuz with the first epic (and with most), it is possible to do some parts before others rather than in the order of which it was intended.

You need:<br />
Redwood seed (foraged in pog)<br />
Pure rain water (foraged in postorms)<br />
Corrupted storm giant heart (off Corrupted Volaas in postorms possibly spawned by talking to Bittrik the Unkempt)<br />
Empowered Earth (off rare nihil faction golem in barindu)<br />
Earthy Loam (foraged in Innothule)<br />
Unkempt Seed Rituals (drop off Chetari Hoarder in DN down near zlandicar spawn)<br />
<br />
Hand rituals to Derick Goodroot in JP for aerated pot, hand him corrupted heart for heart and cleansing bowl, combine corrupted heart and pure water to get clean heart, clean heart + redwood seed + empowered earth + earthy loam in aerated pot = seed of wrath (containers are consumed on combine) <br />
<br />
Hand seed of wrath in to derick for a response mentioning the Nature Walker's Scimitar.  Now we're stuck again because after Athele, the RM foraged hair, and the loio hair, there's nothing to do.</div></div><hr />

This is what we believe as well (in serverwide.druidsgrove). He says that &quot;he hasn't felt so (insert adjective here) since he saw a Storm Warden pass and analyzed his Nature Walker's Scimitar&quot;.<br />

Hand seed of wrath in to derick for a response mentioning the Nature Walker's Scimitar.Just a thought, guys, but maybe this part is the whole &quot;if you didn't do epic 1.0, here's what you have to do to make it up&quot; thing? And then Derrik leads you to talking to Althele? If that's true, though, one has to speculate how one just randomly walks up to Althele without motivation lol. I'd like a non-epic'ed Druid to hail Althele and see what her text is then, because it might solve a small mystery.<br />

<br />
You say, Hail, Athele<br />
Athele says, Hello , friend. Beautiful is what I would call such a day normally, but lately? I sense that something is [out of balance].<br />
You say, out of balance?<br />
Athele says, I sense something forboding, young one, but you should think nothing of it. The sons and daughters of nature will be able to deal with this problem.<br />
<br />
Seems this confirms it....If you have epic 1 you do not need to do items 00-09<br />
<br />
If you have epic1 the quest begins with Athele.<br />
If you do not have epic1 the quest begins with Derrick Goodroot in JP, and you must get items 00-09 as numbered in a few posts above this one.<br />

Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a look back at the old Epic walkthrough and we had to do the following in water areas :-<br />
<br />
Aqua Gobin in Lake Rathe<br />
Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep<br />
Corrupted Cyclops in OOT<br />
Corrupted Barracuda in LOIO<br />
<br />
Now we already know that LOIO is involved in getting one of the diseased pieces so i'm thinking that these might be the areas we need to focus on whether its mobs, spawned or foraged.<br />
<br />
Has anyone looked over these areas thoroughly and disregarded them?<br />
At least we can then disregard this idea as they then haven't related it at all to the Epic one areas.<br />

I will do some more searching in Lake Rathe today just to go over it again.  I will say that when I zoned into Feerrott yesterday there was &quot;an infected rat&quot; at the druid ring.  the first time I killed it and got the normal &quot;no drop&quot; some skin.  I checked the allakhazam beastiary for feerrott and the &quot;an infected rat&quot; was not listed on the beastiary so I ran around the zone looking forr more then when back to the druid ring and waited while foraging.  3 hours later the rat spawned again so what the heck I followed it around for a while.  It kept wandering east to west going to the y in the river then back to the druid ring.  After a bit of following, foraging whenever it stopped in spots I finally put it out of its misery and went to the y in the river where I picked up a green river sludge *lore, no drop) at the bottom of the river at the y.  At this point Im holding onto it as well as the skin which is a berserker newbie armor quest drop item until we can find out if its needed or not...just seems odd that a newbie rat from the cities would spawn in feerrott and not be a normal spawn and maybe, just maybe it was leading me to something...who knows but guess I wont rule it out until its positively not ours.</div></div><hr />

Think a long time ago....when we traveled to west karana everything there and when you entered the zone you would constantly get diseased or infected by something in the air...what if it started there...maybe check plants and animals in towns and citys that spread out from the karana areas...qeynos etc...maybe speak to Niera and say west karana or something along that line.  It may be nothing, but then again who knows.  Thanks to my sister in law she brought the idea of the long ago disease in the karanas to me yesterday, maybe worth looking into?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Capture a bloated spider in Droga<br />
Capture a sickly mosquito in Cazic thule<br />
Capture a twitching swordfish in sirens <br />
Capture a leprous chokidai in Chardok B<br />
 <br />
So.. Droga could easily be tied to Lake of Ill Omen (Only a zone away, and largest water source close by).<br />
 <br />
Cazic Thule - Close by to water in Feerott, Innothule Swamp, and Lake Rathe<br />
 <br />
Sirens Grotto - Cobalt Scar and Western Wastes<br />
 <br />
Chardok B - That's tougher.. Burning Woods has no real water source, or does Skyfire or Dreadlands.  Still could be tied, but.. Dreadlands has the frozen lake.. other than that, Lake of Ill Omen and the Overthere are about equidistant (Zone connection wise).<br />
 <br />
The other two mobs that Rangers need early on, I don't think are connected necessarily. Astetotic highborn (Veksar) &amp; neuralgic huntress (Western Wastes), though their locations only confirm LoIO and Cobalt Scar/Western Wastes as strong candidates.<br />
 <br />
Just trying to attack the sick plants angle first.. hopefully more will become clear as we work through that.<br />

<br />
&quot;A diseased shell&quot; - lightcrawlers in PoDisease<br />
<br />
&quot;diseased fish&quot; (used in TS recipe) - fished in PoDisease<br />
<br />
&quot;diseased slimesnipper guts&quot; - decaying slimesnippers, GoD Sewers trials<br />
<br />
&quot;diseased tongue&quot; - Pit Fighter Dob (goblin!) in Warslik's Woods<br />
<br />
&quot;diseased bubonian tooth&quot; - presumably off bubonians in PoDisease? <br />
<br />
&quot;sickly froglok skin&quot; - ?<br />
<br />
&quot;sickly rat flesh&quot; - ?<br />
<br />
&quot;parasite infected crab carapace&quot; - regruas in PoWater<br />
<br />
The crab carapace is in an elemental plane yes, but like the ball of elemental clay found in PoEarth for necro epic, the crab carapace is tradable.</div></div><hr />

The ranger epic info there seems parallel to ours, you have a 4 slot container, and likely 4 items to collect.<br />
<br />
So, I spent an hour today in LoIO thinking to myself &quot;if this takes 2 hours average per druid, then when this is solved it could be a bottleneck for a few weeks&quot; I never had the forager spawn.<br />
<br />
I then went and got myself the bag, and went back to LoIO.  Hit tracking over the Astral Projection: nothing.  Went invis and swam in, knowing that they can make stuff invisible to track.  Soon as I entered that cavern lo and behold 3 blue foragers were there - and they were on track now, top of the list.  Question then: is it possible my presence there WITH the pack trigered it?  If this is the case, then no other class, or non-bag carrying druid could help us.<br />
<br />
It is possible there are 4 such locations, likely in water, and likely in remote areas, where 4 such creatures spawn, with equal drops?  Given what an odd place the LoIO one is I'm suprised we even have 1.<br />
<br />
Off to go swim the strange corners of Droga, Sirens, and Guk for me. :dance:</div></div><hr />

Withered treant says &quot;yes my bark is blackened and cracked by sickness. If only I were the only one to be afflicted this way. Throughout the lands this is happening. Agents of some dark god are twisting the lands and their creatures.<br />
 <br />
What dark gods?<br />
 <br />
Withered Treant says &quot;Not long ago, a human passed through this area. Around him swarmed some aura of sickness. Few could see it but with my age I could recognize a bringer of the plague. He seeded the area with pestilence before I could lift a branch to stop him. I believe it was he, and others in other lands, who has bring about this sickness. <br />
 <br />
What sickness?<br />
 <br />
Withered Treant says&quot; I have kept in touch with friends of Tunare and Karana. It seems something is building amid the darkness. Some pact between gods to corrupt. All i know for sure is that you can stop the sickness in this land. I can feel, vaguely. Somewhere, in the mountain and lake areas, and far north amid the cold mountains is where the land hurts most. Go, find the sources of corruption, and bring them back to me. three should be their number.<br />

Bringer of the plague? - what god is the plaguebringer? Bertoxxulous?</div></div><hr />

Might involve skilling Goblin (language) to 100 and using the disguise. Kind of like the alternate Plane of Torment key quest where you had to skill Orc to 100 and get creature faction in PoJ.<br />

I was lucky and did that key before the nerf.</div></div><hr />

Also since the two items are from adjoining zones in Kunark, it's quite possible that we're looking at zones around that area. Considering the other clues, it's possible that the disease is spreading from the goblins in Droga/Nurga and hence the disguise part of the quest later on...?  Okay I admit it's a lot of suppositions, but it fits the current facts.  Going off to kill some gobbos...</div></div><hr />

I would suspect that you need to give the disguise to Fenrix (sp) to have him go and spawn the goblin hider.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the Illusion clicky is not complete, if there isn't some future way to upgrade the item to a &quot;Totally Awesome and Convincing Goblin Disguise.&quot; Lucy shows it's classified as an Illusion spell, but its only effect is &quot;Slot 1: Decrease CHA by 75.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Wouldnt disease find it hard to breed in the sea? what with currents and the such, in lakes, it could fester without tides to take it away again. Just a thought, that leads me to think LoIO, Lake Rathetear, Dagnor's Couldron (thats one from Kunark, Antonica and Faydwer) One lake in each continent would sure be a great way to ensure your disease is spreading. Any other zones with &quot;still water&quot; lakes??<br />
