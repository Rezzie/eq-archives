<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I will be having an arena party soon.  One thing I need to do is duel a paladin.  AA up the ying yang, horse, 65.  Good at playig his class, has see invis,annul magic (no dots maybe?)<br />
<br />
Any tactics to bet this guy, or just stand and die?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What level are you, what AAs do you have?  What spells do you have/don't have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Duh on me, guess that would have helped, eh?  :) <br />
<br />
Level 65, all spells up to level 64 minus GRC, Healing Waters, and E'ci Frosty Breath.  Missing two level 65 spells, Mask of the Forest and Legacy of Bracken.<br />
<br />
AA:  Run3, Spell Casting Fury 3, SoTW2, Radiant Cure 1, WoTW1, Innate Camo, Exodus, MGB.<br />
<br />
Gear is Skyshrine mostly, a few slots upgraded, MP4 on neck slot and ceramic items that offer AE4, Anger of E'ci, ER4.<br />
<br />
Rules of the duel will be self buffs only, no outside buffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jigsaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Charge up WotW<br />
Harmony and invigor him (to take buff slots and push your debuffs as low as you can)<br />
Debuff his FR as much as you can.<br />
Try a snare.<br />
Blast away with Summer's Flame.<br />
Hope you have more mana than he has hitpoints...<br />
<br />
<br />
Best I can come up with.  His stuns are going to annoy the hell out of you.  Try and stay out of melee range.  With his horse, he's probably going to try to joust you, though he may just stand at melee range and chain-stun you~<br />
If he does that, do it back!  ;)   Maybe use Scoriae instead of Summer's Flame, it casts much faster.  You'll only do about half the damage though...  Another choice would be to sneak a mage ring or other spell haste before you go ;) <br />
<br />
Paladins are basically the second most difficult class to PvP againt (1st being bards)..<br />
<br />
best of luck, let us know how it went</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It'll be outdoors so I can use Storm's Fury.<br />
<br />
I have extended range four, that will help.<br />
<br />
I'm open to any more suggestions. I'll try Jig's on cleric see how I do.  :)</div></div><hr />
