<br />
1st fight: i didnt even get to hit him<br />
2nd fight: same<br />
3rd fight: i managed to stun him, then died<br />
4th fight: he has now taken off most of his equip and stands barechested in front of Iron Forge. I get to stun him and he goes down by, say 500 hp, then im dead.<br />
<br />
I used my BG trinket and i have decursive so i could remove some of his dots.<br />
<br />
Im a casual player, so i dont get to pvp that much, but i still win like 50% of the times - depending on what class i fight of course.<br />
<br />
the warlocks, however, are ungankable, unbeatable, untouchables...<br />
<br />
how do u guys do? if u do it at all...</div></div><hr />

Fear + deathcoil + DoT's + pet is the total suck. I have caught a couple by suprise and was able to kill them but it dosent happen very often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">01-12-2006, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion Warlocks are just about the best duelers out there. Not to say best in PvP, just best in 1v1 dueling. Warlocks have enough options to take on any class, but it takes time. Time to farm shards, change pets, recharge their cooldowns, etc. depending on the class they will be fighting. In open world or group they loose a lot of that advantage. But don't take dueling a warlock as an estimation of their PvP skill vs your PvP skill. Real world and BG PvP you can't prepare for everything because you have no idea who exactly you'll be against. Still Warlocks are tough no matter what.<br />
