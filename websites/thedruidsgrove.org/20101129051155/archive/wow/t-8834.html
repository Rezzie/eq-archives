I have a mage friend who keeps talking a bunch of smack, and wants to duel.  He is slightly lower level than me, and I was just wondering what stradegy to use against him.  I have the shapeshift abiltiy to negate polymorph, but am woried about going at him in bear form, and getting slowed.  I know that even with heals i.e rejuv/regrowth i can't afford a ranged battle either.  What should I do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
During this time he may have tried to slow you down, counter by changing to Bear form (currently bugged, it might stick).<br />
<br />
Close to combat range and proceed to bash/maul the living daylights out of him.<br />
<br />
Halfway in shift out to throw up a rejuvenation and potentially regrowth, refresh moonfire, shift back to bear to finish him off.<br />
<br />
Should be remarkably easy. Good luck!<br />

<br />
mages are soft targets, your missing, due to level some important items for pvp I think, not sure if you have stun yet, know you dont have nature swiftness, so bottom line (can't remember if you even have a HoT) is hit yourself with a HoT, FF him, DoT him, then bear for the win in melee.  I think your bear armor is the only thing that will negate the mages high dps.  Watch your health, mages dps is high in comparison to yours, as you near 50% you may want to SS into caster and hit your max HT, then drop back to bear.  You'll likely only get one shot at that as your mana pool will be exhausted most likely.  Make sure you clarify if potions are allowed, you'll want one ready if they are, sux going down becuase one party thought they were a go and the other didn't and you lost becuase the other potioned.<br />
<br />
PS, I know braggin rights are big to some, but bottom line here is, your pvping other classes at a very low level.  This is great XP.  The more you pvp, regardless of whether you win or lose, the better you will become at adapting, so don't let it bug you if you wipe.  Chances are, you'll get better and adapt, forcing the other player to adapt the next time you duel.</div></div><hr />

If you get low, they'll blast the hell out of you then throw in an interrupt so that you can't heal for a few seconds, which generally means you're dead, unless you start the heal at high hitpoints. Use regrowth most of the time, I'd suggest, and keep up rejuvenation.<br />
<br />
Wait till the mage goes out of mana, then follow with cat or bear form and heal as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 15 you are missing most of the tools needed for pvp vs. a mage.  Your hitpoints will not be greatly more than his and armor will not help against spells.  Your advantages are that you can heal yourself, you can root him, and you can melee stun him.  Your disadvantages are that your DPS is very low compared to his and you have no useful instant spells.  His advantages are that his DPS is very high, he can snare you, if he has the talent he can stun you, and he will have at least one instant DPS spell.  His disadvantages are that he can't stop you from rooting him (he doesnt have blink yet), he has little he can do about melee attacks, and at that level he will not be able to stop you from healing (counterspell is level 20+ iirc).  The tactics that Ceyne listed in the above post may work, except than I don't think you have FF yet, so skip that step.</div></div><hr />

Bear form and healing is pretty much gg at that lvl. He begged me to duel again with no healing this time, so i agreed and beat him again. He might of sucked, but my first duel ever as druid had taken place just seconds b4 (rogue 4 lvls higher than me), so I couldn't have been that good myself.</div></div><hr />

Don't bother with forms unless he poly or nova. And just go quick travel form and back again as it's most mana efficient. Spam heal yourself all the time as mages have insane DPS.. melee him in caster form (preferably with a fast weapon) and run around him in circles DOTing with moonfire. Keep your cool and remember that he hits hard but can't really take a beating for long. Just outlast him.. He'll go oom before you do.. promise. :) Counterspell huh? Just NS.<br />
<br />
And oh.. cat form/dash can be useful sometimes if he get's too much distance.</div></div><hr />

You may want to read the first post.... at level 15 none of these strategies are relevant.</div></div><hr />

Geez!  What nonsense is this?<br />
<br />
I rarely do PvP, admittedly.   I do play a 40 hunter and a 35 druid tho.  Hard for me to see the druid winning maybe one time in ten tho against the hunter.  Hunter ought to be the rock to the druid's scissors tho.  Druid most likely at a mid level will be feral spec, ie his talents will be totally useless against the hunter (wing clip, scare beast, bang, bang, critical bang, /bye)   <br />
<br />
And if the hunter has the advantage of suprise?  Aimed shot from a position of suprise?  Concussion stun, sic pet, dot, plink away.  The druid wakes up he is under half health.  If he tries to hibernate the pet, he's dead before he can heal.  If he tries to heal, well, good luck!  Marksman spec hunter can outdamage the instant regen, and beastlord spec hunter has a monster pet that hits every point seven seconds, and heals the hunter for more than the druid regen.  Feral druid cant get a heal off, let alone try to damage.  Travel form and run?  NOBODY runs away from a hunter.  Unlike the druid, the hunter can still shoot on a dead run, with cheetah on, and his pet has dash now.  <br />
<br />
Root him in the dead zone, you say?  Hmm, iron grenade is a nice little finisher for that.  And you are gonna get off a hibernate and a root and a heal, positioning yourself just right first?  In what universe?<br />
<br />
Druid owns hunter, eh?  You say so I guess.   What do I know?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont neglect the abilites that a Druid has.  You're not taking into account that he can STILL heal extremely well w/o talents in Restoration.  When Im low on health I'll usually cast Healing Touch which gives me a nearly if not full health bar. <br />
<br />
Bear form does wonders.  A feral Druid will have Feral Charge which will get him into melee range with the hunter.  The Hunter is minced meat at that point.  I plow right through everything to get close to a hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milhouse</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has several Hunters and I raid with them all.  Usually on the way to Dire Maul, we all like to stop in the arena and throw down.  I haven't lost to one of 'em yet.  Roots + Hibernate + Abolish Poison removes most of thier advantage.  The only time I ever go into bear form against a hunter is to do a quick feral charge to eliminate their use of ranged shots.</div></div><hr />

I call them ass I see them. I'm currently lvl 58 and always wins when I'm dueling lvl 60 hunters at fair duels outside fight club IF. Hibernate the pet. Cure the mana drain poison if needed.. keep him DoTed, root if needed, dash or travel form to get close and just heal or NS if it get's crisis. Sometimes you step into his frost trap If you arent careful, but that's isn't really a big issue if keep your head cold (!). :)<br />
<br />
Dude. Druid IS the hunters nemesis class. Ask anyone. Hunters are best against rogues what I've heard.<br />
<br />
Now I'm talking head to head duels here. Not bushwacking when I'm fighting a mob and are down at 25% health.. anyone can do that.. rogues better than most..<br />
<br />
IMHO (and voted on the official site i think it was) Priests are the best PvP class.. Druid second and Hunters last. Not trying to trash your class.. but when you get to have a pet like hunters do, the main character has to be somewhat nerfed.. it has to do with game balance. And pets pretty much suck in PvP.<br />
<br />
BTW, I can hibernate your pet as an instant. Just so you know.</div></div><hr />
