In an impassioned plea to Democratic senators threatening to vote against the health care reform bill, Victoria Reggie Kennedy begs them not to squander this opportunity because the bill isn't all they would like it to be. &quot;Ted often said that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good,&quot; she writes, arguing that the bill, &quot;while imperfect, would achieve many of the goals Ted fought for during the 40 years he championed access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not here to urge us not to let this chance slip through our fingers,&quot; she writes in the Washington Post. &quot;So I humbly ask his colleagues to finish the work of his life, the work of generations, to allow the vote to go forward and to pass health-care reform now.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Hopefully, their charitable donations to the local economy will put a few ladies through college. Right before they cooperate with the local law enforcement agencies for their dubious blood alcohol content levels, as well as get a first hand view of the legislative powers given to such agents in action, to prepare for the future legislation proposals as necessary.  Seems they always get at least two congressmen around this time of year. Bonus if they are with a private excort who specializes in the sensual art of the pelvic region of the human body with varieties of techniques such as the oral.</div></div><hr />

They then use that as leverage to gain the votes needed. Or else it goes public. <br />
<br />
Nah how it really works is the intial draft goes through the house, changes are made, then, goes to the senate, changes are made, shipped back to the house, house then changes, or does nothing, bill is dead. Or votes, ships back to the senate with any additional changes. Senate, then changes  or kills the Bill, or votes. On going process, the president gets involved after senate approval, by signing the Bill, or sends it back to the house with recommended changes, or vetoes altogether, then, ships back.<br />
<br />
They really do not talk about the full process in school.</div></div><hr />

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091230/ap_on_re_us/us_health_care_deal_statesAPNewsBreak: 13 AGs threaten suit over health care<br />
<br />
COLUMBIA, S.C. &#8211; Republican attorneys general in 13 states say congressional leaders must remove Nebraska's political deal from the federal health care reform bill or face legal action, according to a letter provided to The Associated Press Wednesday.<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe this provision is constitutionally flawed,&quot; South Carolina Attorney General Henry McMaster and the 12 other attorneys general wrote in the letter to be sent Wednesday night to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.<br />
<br />
&quot;As chief legal officers of our states we are contemplating a legal challenge to this provision and we ask you to take action to render this challenge unnecessary by striking that provision,&quot; they wrote.<br />
<br />
The letter was signed by top prosecutors in Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Michigan, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington state. All are Republicans, and McMaster and the attorneys general of Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania are running for governor in their respective states.Right, as if the &quot;Republicans&quot; have never given special kickbacks to win votes.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
It boggles my mind that any intelligent person, regardless of their views, would vote for these people.  Oh wait, none do!</div></div><hr />

Like, all of them.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, that Nebraska senator was an asshole for his extortion and doesn't belong in politics, but I've never seen a bigger bunch of hypocrites before.</div></div><hr />
