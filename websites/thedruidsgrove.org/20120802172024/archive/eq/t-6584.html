1.) As you know we don't post exploits on TDG.. unless the community feels that more attention is needed by SoE to resolve the issue.<br />
2.) The original Author of this post cooperated with the staff to make sure that he was within the TDG Guidelines before it was posted.<br />
3.) Original Author has earned much respect by the staff to ensure his integrity stayed intact and to ensure people didn't get into trouble for unknowingly trying something out that was a posted Strat in the TDG forums.<br />
<br />
Basically.. as we know.. if it looks to good to be true.. its probably a exploit, or something is seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
In this instance.. after confirmation.. the technique was an exploit and I suspect it will be fixed when Gates opens. If you decide to follow the path of darkness.. be warned.. they will be watching.. the question will be.. is it worth it to get a warning on your account?</div></div><hr />
