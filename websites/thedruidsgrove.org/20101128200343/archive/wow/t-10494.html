If any of you have played a rogue, you know that when you stelath you get a whole new bar setup with stealth attack options. My question is this, is there a way to get that to work with the Druid prowl? I could of swore that my druid use to do that. But now it doesn't. I might be thinking of the Rogue and getting it confused with my druid. But I just wanted to make sure.<br />

As far as I know, I never heard of this but I know what you are talking about. Catform dosen't have too many stealth moves anyways. Pounce, ravage is all I have...btw all your other skills get darkened out so yeah...</div></div><hr />
