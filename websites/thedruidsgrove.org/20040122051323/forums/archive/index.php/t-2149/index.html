<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rezoraith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I originally posted this on eqdruids.com, but I felt that this community had an equal amount of talented input, so I was like, &quot;Hey, what the heck, I will post there as well&quot;.  So ya, enjoy and give feedback. If no feedback, NO COOKIES!!!<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Hi guys, I was wondering what you guys/gals felt is the best 2 classes to have 2-box. <br />
<br />
Criteria are as follows: <br />
1. how fast to level<br />
2. how far can you go<br />
3. easy to use <br />
4. fun and enjoyment<br />
5. bragging rights<br />
<br />
Currently I have 2 set ups:<br />
<br />
Ogre Shaman/Ogre Shadowknight (currently striving for)<br />
<br />
1. how fast to level - 8/10<br />
<br />
I think that it is somewhat easy to level with them but it’s really not that efficient in the beginning. Post-50~ish it gets a lot better with fatty slow and big heals. It should also be noted that they get 2 pets, shaman wolf and shadowknight skeleton, that are really underrated by the general EQ community. On top of that, with a shaman and a shadowknight you can mix and match any 4 people to get a 6 person group if that is what &quot;moves&quot; you. So you always have a group going.<br />
<br />
2. how far can you go - 10/10<br />
<br />
65 + all the AAs you want. Slows and decent DPS really does the trick even on tier 2.<br />
<br />
3. easy to use - 9/10<br />
<br />
You can easily swap between the characters because you really only need them doing 1 action at a time, and if the something bad happens, there is time for 1. the shaman to tank long enough to gate 2. the shadowknight to get aggro long enough for shaman to gate and sk to FD<br />
<br />
4. fun and enjoyment - 7/10<br />
<br />
While having a slick poem like, &quot;Hello we are ogres twice/He likes bugars/ I like lice&quot; is great on a roleplaying aspect, the same old tactics get boring after a while. There really isn't that great sense of danger that gets your adrenalin pumping, and it really just relies on basic group tactics that any 5 year old pounding a keyboard could pull off. The plus side is that there are no limitations to where you can 2-box. Get the overthere hammer :evil:  2<br />
<br />
5. bragging rights - 10/10<br />
<br />
WW dragons, need I say more?<br />
<br />
Overall: 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
dr00d and Enchanter (thinking about, maybe, if my ogres get boring)<br />
<br />
1. how fast to level - 10/10<br />
<br />
1 charmed pet = good. 2 charmed pets =  MWHAHAHA :devillaugh<br />
Basically I think that in theory what I would do would be to take these 2 classes and use glamour from dr00d, tashini from enc, and snare from dr00d on 2 rats, bats, etc. and charm 2 pets. The reason why you would get faster exp than just plain soloing is such. 1. You get better exp, bonus from group 2. You can slow with enc, and CH with dr00000d.<br />
<br />
root doting, good clean fun, both have dots, enc will drag exp down though, just because their dots are not as effective.<br />
<br />
duo-quadding, put one on auto-follow. Then run max distance (good to have some focus items, currently i r n00b, so I have none), and cast the quad spell and quad for a bit until OOM. Switch the auto-follower, and use the other class to finish the quad. (this is really in theory, and I havn't checked whether or not the enchanter has quad kiting spells, but I believe they do, correct me if I'm wrong)<br />
<br />
2. how far can you go - 9/10<br />
<br />
Even if at 65 dr00ds no longer are able to find stuff to charm you can stick to 1 charmed pet with enchanter and dr00d can DC something, or with the new 6/11 patch coming, maybe the duo can find someplace to hunt where they can both have pets. WW or ME or you can simply keep on the tier 1 planes.<br />
<br />
But there is no doubt that your prime will be 53 - 60.<br />
<br />
3. easy to use - 3/10<br />
<br />
2 pets breaking at the same time, lol. You have to be VERY attentive, and fast with your hands. Not suggested for people with a heart disease, or is pregnant.<br />
<br />
I would not suggest using EQW for this pair, oh boy.<br />
<br />
4. fun and enjoyment - 10/10<br />
<br />
Adrenalin keeps most people happy.<br />
<br />
5. bragging rights - 9/10<br />
<br />
I believe WW dragons are not out of the question as well, and soloing kromkif captain for benevolent lantern thingy is something that is do-able. <br />
<br />
Overall - 8/10<br />
<br />
So that is my spiel, tell me your ideas.<br />
<br />
#1 account: 60 - dr00d<br />
#2 account: 56 - rogue, 24 - ogre shaman (dude, i started yesterday), 22 - enc.<br />
<br />
*Guess which account powerlevels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Speaking as a druid who does 2-box an enchanter let me throw in my 2cp.<br />
<br />
* 2-Charmed pets = BAD.  Maybe you can handle that level of complexity.. I sure can not since my luck requires both charmed mobs to break charm at the same time more often then not.<br />
<br />
* Enchanter DoT :Enchanter DoTs are only of one line.. which is a magic based debuff/DoT combination.  It has a pretty high resist rate since it has been balanced to &quot;need&quot; Tashania, and has at least 2 resist checks... Its first &quot;tick&quot; of damage also acts like a DD so it can break ROOT when cast.<br />
<br />
Targeted AoE (Quad Kite Spell)... The only Targeted AoE spell that enchanters get is &quot;Gravity Flux&quot;... which can be fun, but since it tosses your mobs into the air it is not very effective in keeping a nice tight pack of mobs to quad-kite.  It is also not as efficient as the druid Targeted AoE lines.<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
That being said.. Enchanters bring some nice benefit to a druid/Enchanter 2-box.<br />
<br />
1.  Indoor hunting.  (Enchanter Charm / Debuff /Crowd Control, Druid Healing / Snaring / Nuking / DoT).<br />
<br />
-With the Enchanter able to mez/blur.. you can get into some nice indoor hunting areas and CONTROL it.<br />
<br />
-With the Enchanter able to charm anything within the level limit, they can always get a pet.<br />
<br />
-With indoor being harder to RUN/Re-Charm, it is nice to be able to mez a pet that breaks charm to recharm.<br />
<br />
2.  SLOW.  Enchanter slow may not be as good as Shaman slow... but it is still a huge benefit (especially in PoP).<br />
<br />
3.  Cripple/Weakness..  This debuff spell line (when stacked with Druid HoR/RI) can make a very large impact on mob damage output and mitigation.<br />
<br />
4.  Clarity.  Always a plus.<br />
<br />
==================<br />
==================<br />
==================<br />
<br />
Overall, with Enchanter-Charm being the main focus of this duo.  It allows for hunting virtually anywhere for either LOOT or good experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqduffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've done about ~120aa points duoing a chanter/druid, and it worked wonderfully prior to the charm nerf.  After the charm nerf the xp wasn't nearly as good and I found I got better xp simply using the chanter to add damage to nuke kiting higher level mobs (yellow or red to 65).  <br />
<br />
No way in the world would I attempt two pets ... other than a DC pet on the druid which I do use all the time.  But charm sometimes breaks infuriatingly frequently, causing havoc to recharm (sometimes).<br />
<br />
Also, if using a pet to tank you do run into problems if you add more than one person to the mix (and intend to still have the pet tank) due to the way charmed pets lose agro if there are more than 4 people on the agro list.  This bites because frequently my partners in Fire are other druids or wizards, who ideally would just be sitting back doing ranged damage.  Alas.<br />
<br />
For pure charm xp, the druid is the best healing partner, due to snare.  Being able to (safely) haste the charmed pet that is hitting for ~650 makes an enormous boost in the DPS and kill rate.  But like I said, the xp doing this doesn't really even compare anymore (haha ... who knows what it will be like after today's patch) to killing higher level mobs solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll submit a couple:<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Druid/Beastlord&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
1. Levelling - 7/10<br />
 - BST + pet +DoTs is excellent DPS and Druid heals are pretty good excepting the 29-44 phase.  <br />
 - This pair excels in outdoor zones, obviously, but can do indoor also, falling back on Lesser Succor if things get messy<br />
<br />
2. Longevity - 9/10<br />
 - This pair can go a long way.  A BST is an absolute dominant DPS dealer at 60+ AND can bring slow/haste to the equation as well (I honestly can't see how this class won't get nerfed at some point -- they're unbelievable =P).  <br />
 - 50-55 can be a bit challenging (before the new melee damag table), but Druid charm should be able to close the gap for that range.<br />
<br />
3. Ease of Use - 6/10<br />
 - Controlling a pet (or 2 if charming) can be challenging.  These classes also depend heavily on lots of buffs so that gets a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
4. Fun and Enjoyment - 8/10<br />
 - There are times when the BST feels just like a gimp monk with a gimp pet, but the closer you get to the end game the more amazing they become.  This pair gives amazing levels of utility all the way up, which makes it more fun.  In addition, at the high end this pair simply rocks.<br />
<br />
5. Bragging Rights - 7/10<br />
 - This combo can do many, many encounters that would otherwise require full groups, so some bragging rights there.  Most major accomplishments will come 60+, however.  <br />
 - Small downside is that both are leather classes and often compete for the same armor drops.<br />
<br />
Overall - 7.4/10<br />
<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Druid/Enchanter&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
1. Levelling - 7/10<br />
 - Was 10/10 before charm nerf.  Now it's 30% less =P<br />
<br />
2. Longevity - 10/10<br />
 - Charming is viable all the way to 65 if you can get ahold of the spells.  Root/Dotting is also nice in many cases, especially with Tash helping Druid Roots to stick much better.<br />
<br />
3. Ease of Use - 7/10<br />
 - Very easy if Root/Dotting, much more challenging if using charm, but still not terribly difficult<br />
<br />
4. Fun and Enjoyment - 10/10<br />
 - Amazingly fun and challenging at all levels.  It makes you dissect encounters, methods and strategies to figure out the &quot;best&quot; way to accomplish the goal.  Nearly unlimited flexibility.<br />
<br />
5. Bragging Rights - 8/10<br />
 - Depending on access to CoT/CoD and AA setup, you can do amazing things with this combo.  WW Dragons for sure plus clearing large portions of 50+ Dungeons.  Some other creative stuff like AoE and quadding make for fun stories as well.<br />
<br />
Overall - 8.4/10<br />
<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
The charm nerf really hammered the Druid/Chanter combo, but it's still a lot of fun to use because of the flexibility it affords.  Most other combinations only allow 1-2 techinques or methods, but Druid/Chanter opens up amazing possibilities.<br />
<br />
*edit - spelling<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ashikita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My personal experience:<br />
<br />
Druid/shadowknight<br />
<br />
1. Leveling: 3/10<br />
At lower level, it's a standard tank/healer combo.  At higher level, it's easier to quad or charm kill with druid and just let the shadowknight leech the exp.  One fun thing to do is let shadowknight do all the pulling in Grey NE corner and druid quad, very efficient.<br />
<br />
2. Longevity: 6/10<br />
When hitting PoP tier 2, this combo can't function much without a slower.  I charm kill the PoS giants a lot, and sk only function as puller/splitter and damage absorber.<br />
<br />
3. Ease of use: 9/10<br />
Usually need to control only one character most of the time.<br />
<br />
4. Fun and enjoyment: 8/10<br />
Sk is a puller and tank, druid is a healer, nuker and porter.  Only thing this combo cannot do is slowing mobs and being a defensive tank.  In a raid, you get to play so many different roles.<br />
<br />
5. Bragging rights: 9/10<br />
Did Fayd, WW Kromrif captain easily, basically a 2-box army itself.<br />
<br />
Working on my 3rd box shammy now...... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">dunno I 2 box druid / warrior<br />
can do Tactics mobs(with war tanking) just fine both level decent. There is not much I cant do with this setup. WW dragons though are pamsy, they were pamsy at 60 they even more pamsy at 65. As for ratings I love my war/druid combo wouldnt trade it for anything else. Ports/evacs/snares/DS/charms/harmony/CH + best tank is great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>AverionTriesAgain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shaman + Paladin/Shaman + Shadowknight is best combo imho. Easy for pal/sk to get enough aggro for safe slowing, and these combo's cover most of a group's needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wiggume</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">necro + shaman<br />
<br />
- 2 pets<br />
- slow<br />
- massive DoT damage<br />
- both have self buffed mana regen<br />
- 1000hp heals on the necro, 2000hp heals on the shaman for the pets<br />
- both have gate for boss encounters gone wrong<br />
- necro rez, expensive but worth it for boss encounters<br />
- FD/ST pulling<br />
- skip content. DA, drag shaman corpse, FD, rez, and your at camp.<br />
- Summon corpse for when things go really really wrong<br />
<br />
Not neccessarily the best combo for easy 2-box leveling. But lots of nice stuff for named encounters. Oh and if necros get a real rez... its on like donkey kong hehe.</div></div><hr />
