<br />
So now I resort to hanging out in Iron Forge, posting on Channel 1 [General] in the vain hopes of finding like-minded players.  I don't blame Blizzard, because the spam on Ch 4 was just ridiculous.  Couldn't keep the status quo.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even get to close to the GUI before I was in a group :) But I guess it's a learning curve for all on servers, and it's a major letdown that they haven't included fixed PvP.</div></div><hr />

Can't blame them. The LFG channel was awesome, and it was also a way to ask questions if needed... They need a channel to replace LFG that extends to ALL regions. Sort of like a universal general channel. *shrug*<br />
<br />
And now I can no longer do my insta-get-a-group trick:<br />
&quot;Looking for mage, UD Strat. We have cookies!&quot;<br />

You have no idea how many people that netted in.</div></div><hr />

There were some people who would prefer to do one but would switch if given the right thing.  For example if you want to do scholo you might do strat if they already have 4.  It was a lot easier to communicate that in teh old system :(  <br />
<br />
I've noticed some bugs with it as well.  I had one guy whisper me asking to join the group because it said we had 2 open slots when in actuality we were full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiskrens</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...And I had an &quot;interesting&quot; event yesterday, when I tried the GUI for finding a WC group. I had the auto-join option on, and got into a group after a few minutes. All well, I thought, until I saw the other members: one 13 rogue and a 9(!) priest...<br />
<br />
- Guys, is this really WC material, I asked<br />
- No, RFC! Was the obvious answer.<br />
<br />
I left immediately, ofc. The &quot;auto-join&quot; feature is apparently really dangerous, since you're more or less saying &quot;Hey! I'm up for anything, any level!&quot;. The obvious answer is ofc &quot;Well, don't leave it on, then&quot;, but that seems to turn of the group search function completly, at least that's how it says in chat log:<br />

You have now stopped looking for group to ...<br />

On my server (zul'jin) there are still 100s of ppl using it.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't have any problems with the new interface however sometimes when you get stuck checking the lookingforgroup channel is a decent solution. Plus the more ppl that use the new LFG interface and provide feedback to Blizzard the better it will get. Complaining about it in game or in here doesn't really help we need people to post their thoughts on the official forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">warasena</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it pretty often. I generally form groups and don't turn on the auto join because that's not much better than the old meeting stone. If use use the group lf player tab even if you're not in a group it's much better. I have to say I'm not very impressed by Blizzards team who pushed this out. I'm sure they could have done a better job, in fact I was hoping for a more flexible tool than they have in EQ1 which is better than what we have  in Wow now.<br />
<br />
We should be able to sort by class, spec, level, desired zone to group in and role. If we needed a healer we should be able to find a Priest/Druid/Shaman/Paladin with the proper spec and level.</div></div><hr />

Wait a second, does that channel still exist after the patch?  Channel 4 is GuildRecruitment, and Ch 5 is called lfg (which I don't think is the same thing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might not be the Blizzard one, but that doesn't mean people can't make their own LFG channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">12-27-2006, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I have my own opinions on all this.<br />
<br />
1: The LFG tool wouldn't be that bad, if it's bugs were fixed and people weren't so retarded as to always check &quot;Auto-Invite&quot;.<br />
<br />
2: They should have kept the LFG channel for those who choose not to use the other system.<br />
<br />
3: The very day WoW was released they desperately needed to  make a world-wide &quot;World - General Chat&quot; channel. I don't see what the hell could go wrong with that. If people spam it, oh well, it's general chat, and they can turn off the chat, and there aren't people trying to find a group in it.<br />
<br />
Sooooo many people (Admittedly, including me) have attempted to make a world general chat channel.. but everytime someone tries it just dies after about half a minute.<br />
<br />
Oh, and about the thing Beorn said, yeah, that isn't a real channel anymore. However many people who never read the patch notes and stuff assumed &quot;Oh hell the patch must have taken off my lfg chat, I'll just /join LookingForGroup again.&quot; Assuming that it's the old lfg chat. <br />
<br />
Part of me is just ranting though, I've been so pissed that Blizz wasn't smart enough to add a freaking &quot;General Chat&quot; world-wide channel since they started the world-wide lfg chat.   It can't be that hard to add one more channel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's inferior to the old one because:<br />
1) It's local, meaning you have to be in a capital or so for it to be of any use<br />
2) It's unofficial, so far from all players will be aware of it and use it<br />
3) As a normal channel, all newcomers and leavers are logged meaning that the more it will be used, the more your chat log will be clogged. This is directly contradictional to 2).<br />
<br />
The new LFG system has potential though, let's hope Blizzard listens to the criticism and improves it.<br />
<br />
And guys, the meeting stones actually have a use now! :)</div></div><hr />

Too bad you can summon only players within the level range.  And the LFG tool itself limits which instances you can look for.  I can see why they would limit the upper end, but not the lower end.  I.e. as a lvl 55, I should be able to browse through all instances under lvl 55, not just those around my lvl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That, is the biggest problem I've found with the design of the LFG tool, besides the fact that the &quot;Auto-Join&quot; and &quot;Auto-Invite&quot; buttons are checked by default -_-.<br />
<br />
Sucks because sometimes I wanna do some easy instance out of boredom or because I'm in the mood for it, and I have to spam around general chat or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiskrens</div><div class="date">01-08-2007, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on that 'gimping' aspects of the LFG UI are the worst - to me it's obvious that they haven't thought that thing out from the users' perspective; how the LFG channel was actually used and/or looked at how CallToArms worked (the LFG/LFM part). It seems more like a &quot;Hey guys, there's a lot of spamming on the LFG channel - we gotta shut that down fast!&quot;-tool to me.<br />
<br />
In order to make it work they should:<br />
- Allow LFG for an extended period without auto-join (am I correct this doesn't work now?)<br />
- Allow search for all levels of instances (but have an option to only see the appropriate)<br />
- Allow search for BG groups<br />
<br />
The latter two are there because that's what filling the other chat channels now anyway.</div></div><hr />
