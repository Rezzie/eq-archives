<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonferal</div><div class="date">03-19-2006, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a recent WSG I was in a warrior made the mistake of thinking I'd be an easy kill.  He and I had a good fight that saw me close to killing him while I still had about 25% of my health.  Well he's jumping all over the place, a tactic I find extreeeeemly annoying, and I get him in front of me finally and I see that what was his 10% or less health has jumped to almost 50%, we were solo, no others around to heal him, he obviously used a healing potion, warriors don't have a skill to heal themselves that I know of.  This really got me mad, I'm screaming at him through the screen &quot;you damn cheating bum..&quot;.  He killed me, kept me from stopping the guy running with our flag.  So this brings me to my question, should I be using potions in BG's?<br />
<br />
It's been my understanding for some time (basically since I started playing game and thought about PvP) that using potions in PvP is considered cheating.  But lately I've seen alot of it being done.  I'd like to know what others think about this.  I even saw a post here suggesting what would be a good potion for a flag-run.<br />
<br />
Is this cheating or not?  If not I could be doing alot better in BG's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If its available, use it. I played Ultima Online for many years and we had the &quot;pot whores&quot;. Many people would complain about it, especially since there was no limit on consuming them in this game. I wasn't into PvP until later in my UO life, and when I did get into it I came to realize that its a very valid tactic. Why would Blizzard put it in the game if it wasn't supposed to be used?<br />
<br />
Those who cry cheating are just upset that you came prepared, and that you're probably going to win the fight. Nobody prevented them from bringing their own potions, which would make the fight &quot;even&quot; in that regard. *shrugs* Granted this is just my opinion, but I can tell you thats how I'll play when I finally get the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes this is correct.  Fact is that anyone can make or buy pots.  Its not some secret exploit.  Every profession has something to bring to PVP.  No one complains when engineers use their death guns.  Or a warrior is running around swinging his arcanite reaper.  How about a warlock in his Robe of the Void.  No more crusader/lifestealing/spell power enchants.  There is no reason anyone should complain about pots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-20-2006, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pots are part of the game.  We can heal ourselves without them, but some extra mana to get that last heal off on a tank as he takes down the general, is anyone going to complain?  <br />
<br />
Rogues live on potions, health, armor, agility, crits, speed, poison.<br />
<br />
I never go into a BG now without some extra armor pots, mana, health and strength.  You never know when you'll need it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's part of the game and it needs to be done to in situations where you can help your team.  I gaurantee if it is me or him and I can use a potion to win, I will use one.<br />
<br />
Potions provide great buffs and advantages in and of themselves.  I don't feel bad for using them because quite frankly there are people who I fight who have better weapons and better armor.  We don't have even stats or equipment so I like to even the playing field.<br />
<br />
It's great in lower BG's to take down a twink (can you say advantage) by popping a potion.  I am sure they are screaming at the top of their lungs.<br />
<br />
I know that potions fall under the 'cheating' catagory in most people's minds but in reality it is nothing different than having better weapons, armor, and enchantments.  Basically you are getting buffs, stats, health, and/or mana from your potions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it were a real life and death situation you would do whatever it took to win right?  <br />
<br />
I do whatever it takes to win a PvP fight.  Im on Arthas (a PvP server) and I have been shown NO mercy 90% of the time.  Once in a while a 60 horde will ignore me but just as often he will kill me on sight.  If I had a potion or trick to use, you bet I will use it.<br />

<br />
My thinking that it was cheating was based on what I'd heard from others.  Guess not many people think that way anymore.<br />
<br />
Going to have to peruse the offerings of my local alchemist or maybe go into alchemy myself.  Free Action potions look particularly attractive for my flag runs.<br />
<br />
It will be nice to have a way to even things out since I'm not really too twinked.<br />

<br />
Where you see much more debate is people using potions in duels, as nothing is really at stake, and use of consummables seems a little &quot;crutchy&quot;.  One problem you will have if feral though is you can't use a potions in forms, so would have to shift out to caster to do the same thing the warrior did.</div></div><hr />

People who hate people who use pots in battle, are merely mad at themselves that they didn't bring any along lol<br />

In a duel setting however, the general consensus is pots = poo for skill. To avoid that verbal onslaught, just ask if pots will be allowed in the duel.</div></div><hr />

I would define cheating as something one player could do but the other couldn't. Normally in a duel I never pot since I don't have to run backy to my body. Something like engineering I might consider cheating.. but I won't get into that whole speal. <br />
In the pvp world though I would see it as anything goes.. they can use a pot or call in their 5 buddies to take you down... not many rules... corpse camping is a bit low especially 60's camping people 20 levels lower.. but hey if they want to waste their time go for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP is PvP. You use everything at your arsenal to win. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen tbh. Only sh!tty players make excuses.. skilled PvP:ers are ready for anything.<br />
<br />
If you don't like pots. Write a ticket to a GM and get em banned. But they are in the game.. get used to it or go back playing pacman! =)<br />

I got flamed a lot for using FAP's in PvP by rogues getting their asses kicked (not all rogues mind you - many rogues can take it).. i mean.. if you CAN'T handle people using stuff that cripples your game plan, you need more practice. =) IMPROVISE FFS!<br />

As graceful chaos said thou.. I don't have much left for corpse campers.. not that anyone can corpse camp me, but not all classes have it as easy as druid when it comes to doding fights.<br />

Not sure on what your basing your opinion on but to me this is just typical PvP.  In duels its commonly accepted that people shouldn't be potting or bandaging.  But BG's and world PvP is different.  I personally don't chug major health or mana pots in a BG.  It just doesn't make sense to.  I just use those mini pots you can buy from the Hall of Legends.  In world PvP I'll chug one if I have one on me.<br />
<br />
I've PvP'd for a long time.  I've been playing WoW since open beta and stress test days.  I love PvP'ing and its what keeps me playing WoW since raiding gets to be extremely boring.  And when I'm out PvP'ing I use it all.  Pots, bandages, healthstones... but I've never used stuff like whipper roots.  And my opponents are doing the same if they are smart.  World PvP is true all out war and this is why I love it.  Use everything you've got cuz I'm going to do the same.  Its generally small skirmishes, hit n' runs or people trying to gank you.  To me this is the most exciting form of PvP'ing.<br />
<br />
In battlegrounds I'm more conservative though.  To me its a waste to chug the bigger pots or use somewhat valuable pots and items.  The death rate is just too high to justify it and I don't mind dying in a BG.... it happens all the time to everybody.  At its roots battlegrounds are just another place where you have to grind time to get a reward.  In the case of battlegrounds you do it for PvP rewards and reputation to buy PvP items.  Its a great place to hone your skills in fighting multiple people.  But many times you just get zerged over without a fair chance to defend yourself.  The more important thing is to get your rep and rank... then move on.</div></div><hr />

Yea thats hilarious.  I remember this Warrior who used major pots, whipper roots, used all these somewhat expensive items in Arathi Basin.  On top of that he had MC/BWL gear AND usually had 1 or 2 people following him around healing him.... usually a pally or a druid.  He had already been exalted in AB for a long time.  He only went in there for easy kills since the rest of the people in there usually had pretty average blues and greens.  I'd laugh so hard when he used all this pots, etc.. and still die.  And it became common knowledge that this guy always had healer groupies so we'd specifically go after his healers.  Ah what fun  :texla:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only play PvP (oh well, sometimes the guild drags me to PvE some.. BWL is the favorite.. AQ isnt my cup of tea yet.. but still, killing da emperors was a fun mission=)).. so I rather &quot;waste&quot; my potions on the thing I'm here for. =)<br />
<br />
Oh, BTW I've been exhalted in AB since october last year. I STILL use pots in AB. Why you ask? Because I like to pvp and I think it's the funniset BG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woolybully</div><div class="date">05-17-2006, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well more power to you then.  I consider it a waste when major healing pots go for around 1-1.5g a pop on my server.  Not sure what yours is like.  Perhaps your one of those guys who doesn't have other characters or as mentioned doesn't PvE much or does nothing other than farm flowers with his spare time.  In that case it works out great for you.<br />
<br />
In my case I have 4 going on 5 lvl 60's which will definitely put a dent in your gold stash.  If I had only stayed with 1 or 2 characters I'd easily have over 2k gold just sitting around right now.  So yep I am a bit miserly when it comes to using stuff in a BG just to keep from dying a couple times.  Especially since I'm willing to take a few deaths for the team to keep a flag from being tapped or just to tie up the opposition and slow them down so our side can get another flag.  To me its just part of the game.<br />
<br />
I also think that AB is the funnest BG right now.  WSG is fun for a druid.. no doubt but I'm not much of a CTF pvp'er.  AV is just a zergfest but worth it to a druid to get a couple epics.  Boring as heck to a feral druid though.  AB is funner but has another benefit.  It gives you a chance to learn how to fight 2-3 opponents at the same time.  It also gives you the chance to do a few 1 vs. 1 in a purer pvp setting.  My main is exalted in all 3 BG's but the best battles have been in AB.  Can't wait til they bring out a new BG.</div></div><hr />

Be careful its contageous.  Once you get your 2nd 60 you'll want a variety of 60's if not to have another character to pvp with and learn about another class but also to do instancing with your friends.  Most of my friends/guildmates have multiple 60's so we can usually put together some kind of party to go do Scholo/DM or something.  Only problem I've noticed is that it tends you make you poor.  Thats probably my fault since each of my characters has some kinda max'd out skill like mining, leatherworking, tailoring, engineering.  I think this has sucked up a bunch of my gold.</div></div><hr />

Goa - Rogue killer<br />
<br />
I build my druid as a rogue killer (believe me, I've fought the best of em - even the master epic geared AQ40 rogues - my favorite target are undeads. ;))<br />
<br />
I also roleplay my druid as a undead rogue slayer - drives them crazy, promise. :)<br />
<br />
Many ppl thinks its all about epics - bull**** i say.. I have over 40 epic items, I still use blues in PvP because they are better.<br />
<br />
Undead Rogue slayer FTW! :D</div></div><hr />
