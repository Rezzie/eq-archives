They're not post wipes, per se, it's the boards being restored from backup.  We've been &quot;hacked&quot; several times (mostly likely a script kidd ie using an exploit scanner).  We had to restore as the hack (which focused mostly on the WoW side of TDG), deleted all the WoW side posts and forums.  That said, I believe there were only two restores done, and the last was on the 26th of June.<br />
<br />
I think Sobe posted this before, but the restore killed the post... we have two upgrade licenses for vB now (EQ2 and Vanguard TDG are going away, just EQ1 and WoW staying).  Hopefully the upgrade will prevent the exploit hacks.<br />
<br />
It cost $125 for the restore, then $60 each for the two vBulletin licenses.  The yearly hosting fee of $~450-500 is also coming up in October, I think.<br />

Odd, I lost a post I made this morning.  Could it have been nuked for some other reason?  The title was: &quot;Reuters: Game show looks to convert atheists&quot; -- I'll post it again.<br />

I realize you're probably just making a general plea for donations but, just for the record,  I've donated at least $20 every year since '02 including once just after the first board wipe a few days back.<br />

Edit: Forgot to say thanks. :)</div></div><hr />
