However I have noticed that I am missing at an alarmingly high level against 25 man Bosses...WowWebStats is showing a miss rate of around 11% to 17%.<br />
<br />
This seems extremely high to me, especially early in fights, where one miss could mean the difference between maintaining aggro and causing a wipe.<br />
<br />
Anyone able to suggest some items that are decent for bear tanks that include hit, or good gems for adding hit.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I believe that expertise is just as good, if not better, than +hit and it is easier to find on tanking pieces (Blizzard must want us tanks to use it rather than +hit).  <br />

Then it becomes about as good as hit is. The only exception is that hit improves your taunt's resist chance. Expertise is the best stat to improve your threat on a per-point basis. It's also one of the best ways to improve your survivability, thanks to removing parries from the boss's table.</div></div><hr />

Not many to pick from.  And a few are not tanking pieces.<br />
