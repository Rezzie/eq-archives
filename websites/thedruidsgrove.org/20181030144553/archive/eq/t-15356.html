Natures Boon (the ward the heals everyone around it) came out during Gates of Discord.  When OOW came out they added to it by upgradeing it to Boon of the forest furthering its healing ability.  Now in TSS they came out with another upgrade called Natures Blessing.  However - Natures Blessing does not require Boon of Forest Rank 3 to upgrade.  They both require only the original Natures Boon Rank 5.  So whats the difference?  Both cast the same effect, both cast the ward, they cant be used at the same time.<br />
<br />
My question is.. If they both cost 5 AA and only have the same prerequisite (Natures Boon 5) then how are they different from one another besides expansions.  Shouldnt Natures Blessing require Boon of the Forest Rank 3 as its prerequisite? -- or did they make they just make a mistake?<br />
<br />
So basicly I was able to upgrade to Natures Blessing with only having Rank 1 of Boon of the Forest.</div></div><hr />

Not that it matters much, because if you are buying those you should be down to the bottom of the barrel in terms of AAs to buy as they totally are not worth the AA costs.</div></div><hr />
