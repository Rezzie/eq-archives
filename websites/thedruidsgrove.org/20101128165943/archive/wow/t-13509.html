<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">11-10-2009, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering if 3.3 isn't happening today?  Had a guildie close out of WoW to update an addon- and he had a heck of a time logging back in because he got the &quot;Blizz Downloader&quot; when he tried to get back in, but nothing was downloading.<br />
<br />
He had to &quot;trick&quot; it into letting him log in...(not sure how...but that's what he tells us lol)...It may just be a small patch for the new Battle.net thing?  Has anyone heard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">11-10-2009, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got DC'd last night and experienced the same thing.  I had to run the repair app, and then it downloaded the patch without problems.  <br />
<br />
The file was much too small to be 3.3, but as is typical for large content patches, it seems the smaller files are starting to transfer.  We saw 3-4 mini downloads before the big mother with 3.2.  Also keep in mind, the Battlenet conversion deadline is closing in quickly.  The patch could have had somthing to do with that too.</div></div><hr />
