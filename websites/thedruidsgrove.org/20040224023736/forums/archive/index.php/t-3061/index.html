<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I ask this question every expansion so I'll ask it again.  So far, I've planned out some decent armours for a druid but haven't seen any chain/plate LDoN items as yet.<br />
<br />
Planned visible gear:<br />
<br />
head:  Kerasha's (no graphics - YAY!)<br />
arms:  Leaf Twined Guards (plate)<br />
bracer: Bracer of Flickering Flame (plate)<br />
hands: Kerasha's (leather but can't really tell)<br />
chest: Elysian (chain - we don't do AHR anymore)<br />
legs: Seru (plate)<br />
feet: Sirran's Boots of Insanity (plate - we don't do Vulak anymore)<br />
<br />
Every one of these items (except for elysian) have more than 100mana.  They have decent stats, look excellent and can be used as standard raiding gear.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
It's kinda sad that NToV gear is the best druid usable non-leather shoes available.  Or ... maybe a comment on how powerful Vulak gear was in the Velious era.</div></div><hr />
