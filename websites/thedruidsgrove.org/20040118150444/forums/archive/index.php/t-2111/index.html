<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stewwy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night we were in HoH and we were having a trivial time killing the armor's, Valorian Guards, Lieutenat's etc.  Made our way south to a place with Hero Shrine Guardians......pulled two......mezzed one and melee started in on other......then a Lieu wandered by....then the 1st Sargeant, then 2 more Lieu's and then when the Shrine Guardian died 3-4 more Shrine Guardians popped on us....not good. <br />
<br />
So is there something special about Hero Shrine Guardians? I guess you shouldn't kill em? We had no problems the entire night until we attacked a Hero Shrine Guardian. Any advice on this or other wierdness in the zone would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
<br />
cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaitan22</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm in the basements whenever I exp in HoH.  However, I have noticed on runs to hohb and trials that there are 2 sets of wandering Hero Shrine Guardians now.  Each set is 2 or 3, almost perfectly stacked on each other.  I'd guess that wherever you were killing, you just happened to be unlucky and get the 3 wandering sgt/lt's and then some of the wandering Hero Shrine Guardians.  I'm guessing also that the wandering Hero Shrine Guardians arent supposed to be wandering :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IF you watch the zone emotes, there is a &quot;Changing of the guard&quot;  you have to watch your timing to avoid this event for your particular area or you get lots - o - mobs.  At the changing of the guard for your area, the Hero Shrine Guardians can respawn even if out of time/sequence.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Audo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have fought a bit in the area you are talking about. The person above is correct. When you see the zone shout &quot;changing of the guards&quot; 2 hero shrine guardians will come to &quot;relieve&quot; the 2 already posted.<br />
<br />
So if the 2 Hero Guardians are spawned and the 2 are on the way to relieve them, you have the potential for quite a few mobs. And the Lieutenants (sp?) are roamers, expect to see them at any time. (also - the Liue's give 3% aa per, rather then 2% in my time there, so if things are clear pull em they are not difficult)<br />
<br />
You can avoid aggro on the wanderers by staying in the corner there right accross from the 2 Hero Guardians.<br />
<br />
Anyone can single pull the Hero's or the mobs in the halls in the shrine itself with harmony.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit</div></div><hr />
