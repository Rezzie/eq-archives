<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrækLord</div><div class="date">11-01-2007, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. So I have this urge to level a resto druid just for the fun of it, and have decided the best way to do it would be running instances all the time. This helps both ways because I find instances extremely fun, and I get a bit more xp and some nice loot too.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Now I know, as a resto druid in the making, I need to stock up on stam, int, and spirit for now at the lower levels, but I can't seem to find any good leather pieces at lower levels. Should I simply search harder and stick with leather, or should I try out some cloth (lol at cloth on male tauren)? I'll become quite a bit squishier, but of course, it'll be easier to find lots of int/spir/stam/etc., and I have a good guild right now I can run with, and most of the current low level pallys/warriors/ferals can tank rather well, so I won't be getting hit on quite so much.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />

Anyways, just wondering what you guys think. And just so you know, I'm intending this character to be my &quot;fun&quot; character. I don't care how long it takes for me to get to 70, really. I just wanna unwind and have fun after grinding on my main all day. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for green gear, look for of the ox, eagle and and I forget the other one. Basically int/sta, int/spir, spir/stam. Just mix and match to suit your needs. You'll have a really hard time finding gear with all three stats simply because there just isn't much, if any, green armor that'll have all three.<br />

Leveling a restro druid isn't bad. The only problem you'll run into is your reliance on others in order to complete things. Leveling a restro druid is like leveling a holy priest. You can sure heal, but you can't kill worth crap (especially later on).<br />
<br />
Constant instant runs might burn you out: watch out for that.<br />
<br />
Other that that, good luck to you! Feel free to post any questions.</div></div><hr />

Leveling resto is rough.  While instances will net you a lot of XP, you miss out on a lot of cash, and random drops while questing.  <br />
<br />
I'd suggest you go feral until 58 or so, then go resto to level in  Outlands where groups for instances are much more available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did start another druid and currently leveling as feral.  Everything is much easier and being in a pvp server I don't get killed as often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dingodog</div><div class="date">11-01-2007, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I levelled pretty much solo as resto - I think that patience is a good personal quality to have if you want to try it!  <br />
<br />
Someone asked me once &quot;You're resto? How do you kill mobs?&quot; Answer: &quot;slowly!&quot;  The biggest problem I had was that killing mobs took so long that they may well have respawned before I had time to accomplish the aim of the quest - sometimes it felt like I was killing the same mobs 3-4 times!  It was also funny seeing other players trying to work out my spec - I was once asked &quot;Are you Balance or Feral?&quot; Hehe... resto wasn't even given as an option!!<br />
<br />
One thing a resto druid can do particularly well though is to heal up and run away if needed!!<br />
<br />
I personally collected DPS and healing gear - tanking gear wasn't worth it for me.  My RL mate made me some nice leather healing gear but I'm sorry I cant remember the name of it - but it may be worth asking your leatherworking guildies if they can make you anything (if you're not a leatherworker yourself).<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want a different challenge, and have the patience for it then enjoy your levelling :biggrin: <br />
<br />
All the best<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">11-01-2007, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, I as well leveled Full Resto up to 70!<br />
<br />
It was a pain sometimes...but once you hit about 50'ish...just build up a nice DPS suit and you should be ok.<br />
<br />
And if you're fighting mobs your level or one lower, you can go bear and Swipe the night away pretty well.<br />
<br />
As long as you get a &quot;grinding suit&quot;, you should be ok even specc'd Resto.</div></div><hr />

Right now I'm looking at:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0zZZVEcteqrest<br />
 <br />
Pretty much just filling out Resto completely except for Imp MotW and Natural Shapeshifter and taking up one point in Nature's Grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">11-01-2007, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that is pretty much the best Resto build.<br />
<br />
But I'd take Imp MotW instead of Furor. If you are going full Resto, you will mainly be in groups, and there the better buff is more useful.</div></div><hr />

Solo play will not be as fast and if you decide to level resto, I'd suggest playing a root+nuke playstyle (especially since 1/3 of +heal will be +dmg too next patch)</div></div><hr />
