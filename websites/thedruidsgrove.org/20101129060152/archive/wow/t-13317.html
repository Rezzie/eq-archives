<br />
What kind of gear will you be wearing, and how will you be gemming and enchanting? I ask this because there's more of a seperation now than ever before between feral and resto, and now that our Dragonhide gear comes with NO int, our mana pool is extremely low. How *i'm* geared, gemmed, and 'chanted, for example, i would be OOM pretty quickly after throwing a few heals...<br />
<br />
Going by my dismal 2's rating this past season, I'm open to suggestions, too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">04-15-2009, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i myself haven't used it... a little earlier in the season i had a mage team-mate in 2's... we came up against a mage/druid combo... i noticed they had LotP aura, THEN noticed the druid with ~19K mana...<br />
<br />
then we were pwned :(<br />
<br />
that's really all i can offer</div></div><hr />
