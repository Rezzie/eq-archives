But admittedly my eyeballs are on my raid UI not my mana bar all that fixedly.  I'll have to look more closely.<br />
<br />
Do you find that regular innervate is enough to refill your bar 100%?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you can cast it on your healers to fill their bar an still get some sweet regen for yourself too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm really asking is unglyphed Innervate enough to fully regen your mana or is the 20% additional that the glyph gives you necessary to fill up your mana bar?<br />
<br />
I guess I'll just have to play with it and see.  I have to admit I hadn't seriously thought about glyphing innervate because I don't generally share my innervate with anyone but it might be worthwhile for the extra 20% it does when you cast it on yourself.</div></div><hr />

It does not fill mine. This is a good glyph.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know if tree form, I have crazy spirit regen, so I assume it fills me up.  I need to be glyphed for it to fill me up in boomkin form.  (I have significantly less spirit based regen in Boomkin, as well as much more time &quot;Casting&quot;)</div></div><hr />

I think I'll swap out that Rejuv glyph for innervate and we'll see how that is.  Now that I think about it, Rejuv is cool but how often does anyone really linger at low health?  On a raid they usually get boosted up pretty quickly or die.</div></div><hr />

Yeah!  That's what made me reconsider my non-use of the innervate glyph.  I'm glad she thinks this stuff out so I don't have to.</div></div><hr />
