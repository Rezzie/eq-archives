In your opinion, what is the best weapon obtainable via PvP rewards for a feral druid? <br />
<br />
Question 2 (bit of a noob question, sry):<br />
What stat(s) contribute to increasing the amount of damage you crit for (e.g. my FB usually crits for about 1400ish; what do I do to get 2000ish)?<br />
<br />
Question 3:<br />
In your opinion, is it really worth seriously pursuing new PvP lootz now, given that we'll be ditching them for greens by lvl 63 or so?</div></div><hr />

PvP doesn't offer much in the way of feral weapons. The cost of the rank 14 HWL/GM weapons doesn't justify the return, IMO. Not sure how much The Unstoppable Force from AV costs, but it's probably significantly less, and still a good feral weapon once enchanted. <br />

AP, and the easiest way to raise that is go for strength (and have HotW talent maxed).<br />

You won't be ditching them for level 63 greens. If you had the entire warlord's/marshal's epic set, you might jettison a few pieces, but I have no doubts you would still be wearing a few when you hit level 70. What I've seen of the expansion loot, some has been really nice, but even the level 70 arena gear isn't much of an upgrade from the current epic pvp set. Yeah, it has a lot more stamina and it has the upgradeable slots, but that's about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. strength. increase your base dmg, and a crit will just double that. well actually, with that new 5pt talent, u get a bigger crit dmg %.<br />
<br />
3. it might be worth it to get some of it, to fill in the poor items u currently have. wutever helps u level more efficiently in bc. look at it this way... a 61 green still isnt better than a 60 epic.</div></div><hr />

I see what you mean about TUF vs the HWL weapons.  You can get more +strength from TUF than the HWL mace if you add a + 15 strength enchant.<br />
<br />
Is it the +str enchant you'd recommend, Falloraan (or anyone else)?</div></div><hr />

High Warlord's Pulverizer<br />

235 - 353 Damage Speed 3.80<br />

I really wish they would scale with ferral, I'm really only going for it for the sta. <br />
That hwl weapon looks real easy to get a few days work.. it takes the av tokens which can suck, but av is mostly just a race now no longer 15 hour games</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sonnyg95</div><div class="date">12-10-2006, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually debating on this issue too.  I'm close to revered with CC, so I'm not sure if I should just grind for the mace of unending life for the weap (although, that'll still be a long way from revered to exalted :( ), and just pvp for the hwl gear.  There isn't really any good HWL feral weapons.<br />
<br />
There are, however,  some cool weapons for our other trees.  For healing, that healing mace is sick with +136 (or somewhere around there) healing effect.  The spellblade looks really good for balance druids too with something like +72 spell damage.  With therazene's touch, that makes for some great +spell damage.  Even that warlord staff looks cool.<br />
<br />
But I really want to look for feral gear/weapons because that's the route I'm taking for leveling for TBC.<br />
<br />
Anyone care to comment on what should be grinded for first? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

You'd better off getting two or three HWL armor pieces for less honor than it costs for one weapon. As for only taking a couple of days, that depends on how much time you plan on pvping and if you are going in with a pre-made farm team. If you are pug-ing, good luck. Different for easy-mode horde I'm sure, but for alliance with long queues I spent about 20 hours pvping this week so far and stand at just over 17k honor. I believe the GM/HWL weapons go for around 45k.</div></div><hr />
