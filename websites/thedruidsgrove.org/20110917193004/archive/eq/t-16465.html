 <br />
A few of our druids are in hiberation (that leather wasn't quite warm enough to sustain them through these snow blizzards), so we are currently looking for 1-2 more druids.<br />
<br />
Primal Evolution is a relaxed raiding guild about to enter Solteris (we're working on keys now). Our mantra is FUN &gt; ALL and we try to back that in everything we do.<br />
- We've been self toted as the Gilligan's Island guild at times; we don't require your blood, sweat and tears when you raid with us though we DO require your attentiveness and focus.<br />
 <br />
<br />

<br />
 <br />
LOOT SYSTEM: <br />
Raid force breakdown - 1/2 part time, 1/2 full time raiders <br />
 <br />
- 45-day rot DKP system (points bring you to the 'contender' group) <br />
- Loot Council (officers/members) make the final decision based on several factors <br />
- Points awarded per hour regardless of kill/drops (so approx 20-25 points awarded per week)<br />
- Item cost is demand based (20 points full price, 40 points high demand, 10 points half price, dictate/free)<br />
- Low demand items are dictated for free so less rots<br />
 <br />
ALL who raid receive rewards quickly and repeatedly as we believe we're only as strong as our weakest link. <br />
 <br />
