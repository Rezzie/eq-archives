How many times has someone asked a Rogue to sap an animal mob? I've been asked dozens of times to dispell diseases and one idiot actually told me to use remove curse!!! I had one idiot hunter ask if I could rez. I said yes but of course he didn't know the time restrictions on it. Needless to say I wouldn't join his group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anywayz, I agree. Learn at least the basic skills for the other classes, so as not to sound like a fool.</div></div><hr />

Its not even class related its basic logic.</div></div><hr />

I usally leave the group at that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I agree, to be the best player you can be you need to know about the other classes and their strengths and weaknesses  Being able to take advantage of another classes strengths and weaknesses is the only want to excel at PvE and PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">11-30-2006, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said it 9er. If I know what spec the classes in my raid is, it helps me understand how they will play the role (if they are good). I have played all the classes and have a good feel for what they can do...mind you none to 60 like my druid. But, I do understand the mechanics of the class and how I/the party can benefit from their strengths and offset their weaknesses. We do it every day when we are healing and a clothy pulls aggro...you know to help pull and hit with a HOT...why because you know they have weak armor and some have very little CC to help themselves. It goes much further than that. If I'm in a 5-man I always ask the rogue if he's imp sap...this will be a big benefit as a group with a mage, priest, rogue combo can effectively take out of the fight 3 mobs to be dealt with later, while the entire party focuses on 1 individual target. Know the strengths and weaknesses and you will gain an entire new respect for how Blizz designed the classes and how vital it is to work TOGETHER!</div></div><hr />

That would be a sweet talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be cool if I could Teleport a mage over there with me.<br />
<br />
I know when I first started the game, I had a hard time remembering whether or not it was Mages or Warlocks that conjured water.  But when I'd ask ppl, I'd always preface my request with &quot;exuse me, i'm new to the game...&quot; so as not to come across as rude or ignorant.  <br />
<br />
I think everyone should at least try to play every class, or if they dont have the time / patience to do so, make sure to group with another class for a whole level or so so that they can know what they do.</div></div><hr />

When a level 60 in Strat or Scholo asks a Druid for water that's the sign of a poor player.</div></div><hr />
