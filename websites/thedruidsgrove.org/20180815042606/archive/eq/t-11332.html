<br />
Your body does not digest dietary fiber.  Those carbs do not turn into anything, they pass on through.  You do not normally count those calories either.<br />
<br />
Another 'carb' that does not turn into blood sugar is glycerine.  It does become the glycerol head of the molecule of cholesterols that flow through your body--the tri-glycerides.  Glycerol is an alcohol by chemical nature-7 Calories per gram as opposed to 4 Calories per gram for carbs.<br />
<br />
You will usually find a lot of glycerine carbs in protein diet or energy bars.  And sometimes 'diabetic' candies.</div></div><hr />

It's hard for the common Joe to know which carbs are the like that you describe though, so I mostly follow the Nutrition Facts and the number of Carbs to know how much insulin I need to receive from my insulin pump.<br />

Is there a way of knowing? Aside from protein bars and looking for Glycerine?</div></div><hr />

Don't rely on merely what you consume.<br />
<br />
Check your glucose regularly, Nimchip.<br />
<br />
And take a nutrition class.  Your local community college or even learning annex/exchange should have one for cheap.</div></div><hr />

That being said, the user is supposed to check their blood sugar levels 4x/day to ensure that their dosing is correct.<br />
<br />
Nimchip, trying to discern which carbs go to sugar and which are less digestable would be a monumental task.  It's much easier to just do as you're currently doing.  I have to control my sugar/carb intake as well, and went through the whole glycemic index thing trying to figure out what I could eat more/less of, before finally just giving up.<br />
<br />
My rule of thumb is &quot;if it's green, it has low carbs, if it is white/yellow it is all carb, if it is meat, it has no carbs&quot;.  It just makes life so much easier than trying to determine the glycemic index difference between baking potatoes and red potatoes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, being a devote of the low carb life style, basically I subtract all the fiber carbs from the total carbs.  Sugar alcohols are metabolized somewhat so even though they're used in diabetic candy, some of them actually metabolize at 50%, and they'll give you fearsome bad gas.  Some sugar alcohols are metabolized much less, but they're expensive and rarely used in commercial products.  So to be safe, count half the sugar alcohols as carbs.<br />
<br />
There's some pretty good low carb stuff out there these days, even a baking mix I make cakes and stuff out of.  I find tortillas, bread, even some cereals out there that are low carb and not too bad tasting. <br />
<br />
I'm not at all certain how they list glycerine on foods, whether they show it as a carb, protein or what.<br />
<br />
By the way, this guy has a really informative page.  I'm not diabetic, but some of his stuff applies to my way of eating.<br />

But yea i know waht you mean, I mostly buy &quot;no sugar added&quot; or &quot;sugar-free&quot; stuff which is expensive and mostly contains sugar-alcohol. I'll check that site out though, cause i'm interested in the types of carbs, and what they consist off.<br />
<br />
Originally my diet wasn't carb based though... it was until i got the insulin pump that they told me to take up a carb based diet and sent a diet expert to my house to explain sort of like when i was first diagnosed.</div></div><hr />

The letters stand for the Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen. CHON was compact, nutritious, synthesized from easily available elements and was a dietary staple of space travelers. I'm not sure who originally came up with CHON, but I think it was Robert A. Heinlein. Science fiction of yesterday becomes science reality of today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After working at a soya mill for years I can't stand the smell of the stuff.  Belive me working next to an area where they are cleaning out a pit full of 15 ton of rancid soya beans will put you off eating soya for life  :Eyecrazy: <br />
<br />
TVP (textured vegetable protein) is basically extruded mashed soya with flavours and when I see veggies eating it I always want to tell them how its made and belive me it would put them off for life.  <br />
<br />
P.S the TVP we made for pet food had to be an higher grade than the stuff for humans  :elfgrin:</div></div><hr />

guck .. not in a million years! We are omnivores for a reason! Circle of life my friend. If we weren't around, things would get tamed by another carnivorous or omnivorous species.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried low carb breads. They had a heavy mediciny taste. Blech. The most awful thing to come of the low carb craze.<br />
<br />
That's probably the soy flour taste.  I agree, blech.  But Trader Joe's has one I think tastes really good, its Garlic/Cheese low carb bread.  Yummy.  Then there's a host of other ones that don't really taste good or bad, they just hold the insides of my sandwich together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, when i say carb based it means that the amount of insulin i have to input in my Insulin Pump has to be calculated by the amount of carbs im consuming. They tell me NOT to eat too much carbs..<br />
<br />
example... i eat a slice of pizza (which is kinda bad because of the flour/bread)<br />
it has 36-40 carbs. I take this number 36 carbs and divide it by 12. The number resulting (3) is what i need to input in my pump when i eat.<br />
<br />
It's not that bad really, i know most carb counts of the stuff i usually eat already :)<br />
<br />
Also as a puerto rican, our house meals mostly consist of rice, beans and a piece of chicken/beef/ etc &gt;&lt; rofl im serious too... so that's kind of hard to give up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, I realized that while I posted that Nim and other diabetics probably know a whole lot more about insulin pumps than I do.  I just had two hyperglycemic patients that day, and one was in for her left big toe amputation and recovery.<br />
<br />
That **** is nasty if you don't watch it.  And she checked her glucose twice a day.  They should have young diabetics watch, and in particular smell, a dressing change.  And they both had MRSA, WOOT!.<br />
<br />
I would be checking mine a dozen times a day after that.</div></div><hr />
