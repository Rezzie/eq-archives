<br />
While I do like that it gives me an easy to read view of what people's health status is like I'm not a great fan of actually using it to apply healing.<br />
Do I just need to spend a bit more time tinkering with it or is it primarily more useful for priests given the general advice of rejuve + Stack Lifeblooms/pop swiftmend which it doesn't really seem to be that good at doing.<br />
<br />
I've run healing on a grand total of two runs so far (and normally play a huntard) so please forgive me if this is a stupid question.</div></div><hr />

I use hotkeys for NS, swiftment and macros.<br />

Grid just seemed like alot of work for very little incremental benefit to me.</div></div><hr />

I like the uncluttered layout of it and I'm not averse to panic hitting a quick heal using it but it doesn't really seem to designed with druid healing in mind and I think I fall into the lazy category too, at least for now.</div></div><hr />

One of the other raid frames is better.  I use a combination of Xperl (for target, focus, stuff like that) and Grid.  I use mouseover macros for healing so I never have to click to change targets.  I used to use Clique but all that mouse clicking was making my arm sore.<br />

Here's a sample macro:<br />

#show Lifebloom<br />
/use Ribbon of Sacrifice<br />

There is a &quot;better&quot; macro for that, essentially its the same, but it doesn't show the irritating error message.<br />
<br />
Ill try to look it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">06-04-2008, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you could just add /run UIErrorsFrame:Clear() at the bottom<br />
 <br />
At least I think that is it. Am doing this from memory and believe Aral is talking about the red messages that show on your screen when an item in a /use line is on cooldown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh!  I loaded sRaidFrames and I'm kind of &quot;meh&quot; about it.  They take a LOT of screen space and the icons are teeny.  But I think I saw you could get grid style icons for it so maybe that would work better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering it was my second instance run healing and the first without using Kara+level companions I'm not too disappointed, at around 500 healing when we went in I'm just not putting out enough healing at the moment although a quick trip to the AH has increased that to 600 and I'm intending to stick with it and  improve. I'm in no rush to get the druid to Kara, we've got three great priests doing heals at the moment and my current main still needs rep and badges but depending on what happens when the next expansion releases I can see the druid potentially becoming the main and the hunter the alt.<br />
<br />
My technique needs work and I do need better indications of cooldowns, but for 5 man healing, those 4 macros were awesome, or will be once I get the right sequence down pat and move a few things around a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">06-05-2008, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad you liked the macros!  Mouseover makes things so much faster, IMHO.<br />
<br />
For cooldowns I recommend OmniCC.  It puts the timer right on your hotkey button.  I like Quartz because it shows you a bar with the GCD ticker.  GhostPulse (ace) is also really cool, it flashes a big icon on your screen when a cooldown is ready.<br />
<br />
I move the GCD ticker really close to the raid frame so I don't have to really move my eyes to see when the GCD is up.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, I'm sure you already do this but I macro'd healing touch to use Nature's swiftness first:  <br />
<br />
/cast nature's swiftness<br />
/cast healing touch<br />
<br />
Last night I configured Parrot to give me a big visual/audible warning when my mana is at 10% so I'll innervate.  I'm going to love that as I often go quite awhile without figuring out I'm out-of-mana :p</div></div><hr />

Baby steps, while I had thought of combining HT with NS I dont think I'm currently at a point where I'm on top of this, my main's a hunter don't forget, I'm used to twanging arrows into the skull and ninjaing the loot at the end :D I was worrying about the mana loss and being shouted at for using HT to begin with plus the bulk of resto threads seem to think that LBx3 +rejuve and the odd regrowth suffice (and it seems to for the most part even with my druid).<br />
<br />
I know this started out as a thread about Healbot, but I would like to thank everyone who's posted in it, you've really helped a sapling start to look like a tree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">06-06-2008, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">95% of the time LBx3 + rejuv + occasional regrowths = win.  <br />
 <br />
The NS + HT is just for those 'oh $hit!' moments where a mage or something gets almost 1 shot, or the tank takes a really nasty series of crushing blows or something.  Be warned though, that will catch the attention of some mobs.  Nothing like an insta 7k heal to turn some heads</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes, one last macro.... because I'm a total idiot:<br />
<br />
<br />
/cast [target=Zute] innervate<br />
<br />
Why?  Well... too many times I've forgotten to target myself before casting innervate.  Nothing like throwing an innervate on a warrior...</div></div><hr />

<br />
/cast [target=Pookies] Innervate; [modifier:shift] Innervate<br />
<br />
This is just a crude macro.  One of it's downfalls is that if you Shift+press while selecting a hostile target, you'll just Innervate yourself instead of getting an error message.  I'm too lazy to change mine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ztormy</div><div class="date">06-20-2008, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello fellow druids. I am brand new to the forums here. This Healbot thread caught my attention, and I felt compelled to add my 2 copper.<br />
<br />
I am a ToL druid and I use Healbot exclusively. My guild has not progressed far in end-game - we just cleared Kara for the first time last week - so I haven't had the chance to use Healbot in 25 man raids yet, but I love it for 5 man Heroics and the 10 man raid in Kara.<br />
<br />
I have my mouse buttons set for LB, Rejuve, Regrowth, Swiftmend, NS + Regrowth, HT, Cure Poison and Remove Curse (with corresponding warnings) and even Thorns. My bars are set up to show me what HoTs I have ticking on all party members.<br />
<br />
Healbot is a godsend for someone like me who uses mouse and click for everything. It lets me be right on top of everyone's health without having to take time to click target then click heal. In the big fights (or the ones where things go a little pear-shaped) every second counts, and Healbot makes the difference for me.<br />
<br />
I didn't find the setup for it too terribly difficult and I love its customizability (is that a word? lol).<br />
<br />
So, anyway, that is my take on Healbot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">07-17-2008, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not yet, or at least on the version I'm using.<br />
<br />
I've started to use LifeBloomer in combination with macro'ed mouseover versions of every heal/combination that I use.<br />
<br />
lifebloomer is awesome, if a little unintuitive to get working to begin with, but it allows numpties like me to keep lifebloom stacks on 3 targets with no difficulty whatsoever and on 4 with a modicum of sweating and swearing.<br />
<br />
I do still keep healbot running as I do like the general information that it displays and I use it in Battle grounds over Lifebloomer where stacks of Lifebloom aren't as critical as raiding.</div></div><hr />
