In fact in our last 25-man run, we had 9 healers and 5 tanks and had to beg to get DPS.  Needless to say we had a tough time on the DPS race type fights.  I could enhance my kitty DPS, but melee DPS is often at an disadvantage during many fights and Kitty DPS is really tough.<br />
<br />
I need to tank 5-mans, but I'm thinking I might try moonkin as my 2nd spec.  Besides, we don't have another one in the guild.<br />
<br />
Over the next couple of weeks, I'd like to start gathering some AH, crafted and quest type pieces for my moonkin kit, but I have no clue how I should weight the various stats.<br />
<br />
Any one have Pawn scale or a lootrank link?<br />
<br />
How about a suggested 10/25-man PvE talent spec?  I don't care about solo DPS or PvP, just a spec that allows me to maximize my DPS and benefit the group as well.<br />
<br />
Recommended Glyphs?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I have a similar situation.  We are set on tanks (I am MT atm) and we have healers of plenty!  I plan on going Bear/Boom spec once dual hits.  I have on several occasions respec'd Boomkin to squeeze into raids that were not part of our guild. <br />
<br />
While we have tons of healers, there are two things to remember:<br />
<br />
1)  Being a healer, and being a good healer are two very different things!  :)<br />
2)  Every Healing class has a DPS spec too, very few have a tanking spec.  So many of those healers that we see so many of, will be specing DPS for raids, and then you will have OP off healers when needed.  <br />
<br />
Once dual spec hits, I honestly can't see our guild ever running more than 2 healers in Naxx-10 or 4 in Naxx-25.  Once we can have one or two people switch out of DPS to healers when needed, runs will be much more efficient.<br />
<br />
Glyphs:  When Boomkin, I use Glyph of: Wrath, Starfire, Innervate.  I have played with the moonfire glyph and combo'd with the Starfire glyph, its a lot of damage per mana increased, but when all is said and done, I need my Moonfire to be hard hitting early.  It helps with ads on many Naxx boss encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts were..<br />
<br />
<br />
 We dont' have a moonkin in the guild today, the aura alone could be a boost to raid DPS.<br />
 Ranged DPS seems to have an advantage over melee DPS most of the time due to encounter mechanics.<br />
 I already have Cat DPS if I really want to do melee DPS<br />
 Even with a boomkin spec, I can probably serve as a off-healer if the encounter or group make-up calls for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
What talent spec do you use when you are boomkin?<br />
<br />
I still haven't found a good moonkin stat weighing yet...I hope to find one soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hit: 100<br />
Haste: 46<br />
SP: 46<br />
Crit: 43<br />
Int: 26<br />
MP5: 15<br />
SPR: 8<br />
<br />
I would have never though haste was such a good benefit to moonkins.  Why is that?  Reduce cast times of wrath and SF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-19-2009, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are very priest heavy atm, so I am hoping some of our healy priests will go to the dark side!  Also, we have a boomkin in guild, so the crit aura is already up on about 1/2 of the runs.  (He's not an avid raider, but joins us when he can).<br />
<br />
Crit aura will boost to raid + easy 2k+ DPS from the boomkin makes adding one to your raid a no brainer!  Every raid should have one!<br />
<br />
Stats weight...I am definatley no expert (Bear is my primary role) but I say HR first (same for all DPS) and then stack crit.  If your starfire is critting regularily even hunters will have a tough time keeping up with your single target DPS.  Also, Hurricane + Crit = embarassed mage!  <br />
<br />
Hurricane is on par with, if not better than volley right now for AoE DPS.  Mix in a Starfall when there is room and you can clean up right quick!<br />
<br />
I use the cookie cutter spec from Wowwiki for raid boomkin but I add Imp FF too.  (Don't know why they don't)  It helps make your hit cap managable.</div></div><hr />

Though I have to think if you are low in hit, it would be worth the cast until you are near the hit cap.  At which point it could be dropped.<br />
<br />
I also read you only need 1 point in eclipse.  Something about the internal CD and having 3/3 ends up being a waste??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have read the same thing about &quot;Eclipse&quot;, and in theory what they are saying is that...<br />
<br />
Your wrath crits so often that its bound to proc the starfire eclipse sooner rather than later with only 1 or 2 points in the talent.  <br />
<br />
In practice....I want that SOB to proc asap.  Waiting for it to proc is almost always waisted mana and time.  If you are just fighting a targeting dumby I am sure the one point equates to a better investment, but when moving, jumping, running, and avoiding death, I think you are going to want you eclipse to proc early and often.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, if you are serious about DPSing as a Boomkin, get &quot;Squak and Awe&quot; mod.  My DPS jumped about +30% just by knowing my timing exactly.<br />
<br />
With about 1750+ SP and 12% crit (tool tip, not counting talents)  I average about 3k DPS in Naxx-10.  Single target is around 2800 and AoE is +3k.</div></div><hr />

There are too many uncontrollable variables for that sort of theoretical hair-splitting with talent points.<br />
<br />
The simple answer with hit is to cap it if you don't want to bother with complicated break-even calculations and you don't want to use RAWR.</div></div><hr />

Take Balance of Power and you only need 368.<br />

Take IFF and keep it up at all times and you only need 263.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I have seen a PvE build yet with IFF.  I guess most folks do without?<br />
<br />
I've read that Intensity &gt; Dreamstate in terms of MP5, so we could give up Dreamstate for IFF?<br />

Force of Nature?  Cute gimmick or real DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will notice 3 things different from Wowwiki's cookie cutter build.  <br />
1) No Dreamstate = 80 MP5 lost<br />
2) 3/3 Imp FF = Less Hit Needed.<br />
3) I took &quot;Gale Winds&quot; over &quot;Master shapeshifter&quot;.  Which means I sacrifice 4% overall damage for +30% to Hurricane.  Hurricane is by and large my most damage in raids, period.  My hurricane pulses for 1300-1500 per tick.  I had 30k+ DPS when we hit Arub' in 25-man.  <br />
<br />
Many will disagree with buffing AoE because lets face it...trash DPS doesn't matter.  I agree.  But, many boss fights have a trash component to them.  And having uber DPS to squash those ads is a significant benefit to the raid.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Celestial Focus is all about the 3% haste.<br />
<br />
Most serious raiders assume a Shadow Priest is in the raid which provides the same buff as part of their normal rotation.  Saves the Moonkin a GCD and ups their dps.<br />
<br />
Depending on your gear level, the goal for a pure raid spec is to do without Moonglow, Intensity, or Dreamstate except for one point in Moonglow to get the the next tier of talents.  This assumes a Shadow Priest, Ret Pally, or Survival Hunter is in the raid and specced for mana regen.<br />
<br />
Take as few regen talents as you can w/o going oom; it will take some trial and error.  Take them all and you never go oom, but you are forgoing dps talents and will probably finish boss fights with full mana.<br />
<br />
Force of Nature is real dps, it was buffed in 3.0.</div></div><hr />
