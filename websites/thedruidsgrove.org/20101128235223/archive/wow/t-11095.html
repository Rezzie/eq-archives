i saw a nice gear but maybe isnt so good because its a restor one, i like it  because the gear has hig int for criticals:<br />

/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
for the build, i dunno. I would go for a bit more balance/resto mixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaEsoteric</div><div class="date">09-22-2006, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you re going that heavy balance i would find 1 point and get imp. natures grasp, that 1 point brings the proc up to 45% wich is pretty good<br />
<br />
But i agree with Myrdim, I wouldnt go so heavy into balance and either add some feral or Resto points to help your versatility.<br />
<br />
That said, its your Druid and your $15 a month and if you like the build then by all means do it.<br />
<br />
Probably moving a point from Imp. Thorns would do it, and the dps difference would be moot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imp Thorns isn't too bad if you don't have anything else to put those points in but also if you get the cenarion 3set piece bonus which I think is also the imp thorns. Not too sure if these stack.</div></div><hr />

There was a blue post yesterday that they are looking at changing our mana regen from spirit formula, so reflection may be more viable in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

reflection is 15% of your normal regen tick while casting, unless you have tons of spirit, which is rare for a druid, you probably won't get much.  I think my reflection regen when I was moonkin was about 12 mana per tick, likely less.<br />
<br />
Dreamstate is 10% of your total int as mp5, raid buffed my int is around 360 now, so that will yield 36 mp5.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the difference between 5 seconds and the length of a tick, but I usually assume a tick is 2.5 sec, if that is so dreamstate would be 50% better to me.  Results will vary depending on gear obviously.</div></div><hr />

Its definitely not every second, I might buy two, but suspect it is 2.5.</div></div><hr />
