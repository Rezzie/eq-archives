   I was/am a druid from long long ago that was a member of this board.  I've decided to come back after YEARS of being away for another run. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I can't find any good equipment/quest sites for low level druids.  If anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
My EQ druid has always held the preeminent spot in my mind of toons I valued.  I almost feel like I'm betraying him by coming back to eq and not playing him.  Oh well...who knows what may eventually happen. :)<br />

Progression is the thing driving these servers. I personally couldn't care less who unlocks &quot;such-an-such&quot; first.</div></div><hr />
