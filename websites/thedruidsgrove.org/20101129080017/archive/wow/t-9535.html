<br />
Sedge Boots (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=18424)<br />
Backwood Helm (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=18421)<br />
Bonecrusher (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=18420)<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously the helm is not an option, but between the boots and the hammer, anyone done this quest and regretted choosing one over the other? Hammer seems like the choice for me, since there are a lot of good leather boot options available to druids, and not as many good feral weapons. Opinions?</div></div><hr />

It's one of the best blue feral weapons in the game.  The Fist of Ommok is nice but is missing the all important crit%.  The Crystal Spiked Maul is ultra-rare and is only really better for live-on-the-edge cat form.<br />
<br />
Int/Sta boots are a dime a dozen.  The boots from Hydrospawn in DM, the reward from &quot;The Calling&quot;, or the ones from Scholo are as good or better than Sedge.  Even some green 'of the eagle's are nearly as good.<br />
<br />
A better feral weapon is much tougher to find.<br />
<br />
I took the boots and regretted it as soon as I respec'ed feral at 1.8.</div></div><hr />
