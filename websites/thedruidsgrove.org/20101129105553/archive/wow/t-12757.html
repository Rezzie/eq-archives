<br />
My wife is a resto druid and I'm a Feral tank druid.<br />
<br />
We both have kick gear but I wanted to ask if there is a addon for Resto's that would help increase the speed at which she can heal (LB, Regrowths....) ?<br />
<br />
Most of the time she is #1 in raid healing but if she could get a addon that would be less work that would be great.<br />
<br />
Right now she uses just point and click, no addon to help!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
Clique is nice because you can set your spells or macros to be casted when holding a keyboard modifier down (Alt, Ctrl, Shift, etc).  I just hold shift down while in combat and have left-click=Lifebloom, right-click-Rejuv, button4=Regrow, and button5=my NS+HT macro.  Just clicking the player names casts the spell.<br />
<br />
HotCandy is the HoT timer mod I like.  It makes keeping stacks of LB easy, and lets you get into a good rythm of healing when you can see which HoT is going to fall off next so you can refresh it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...</div></div><hr />

I really like some of the new features in the latest Healbot version. For 10 and 25's it is simple and can really speed up your reaction time to raid needs. <br />
<br />
Now I just need find a UI that I can figure out how to set up quickly and like.<br />

See ya, <br />

<br />
I now use Lifebloomer which although a little clunky to set up at the beginning of an instance is invaluable for maintaining multiple lifebloom stacks.<br />
<br />
I also wrote macros for all my healing spells so I can apply them by simple putting the mouse cursor over the toon, lifebloomer or the group icons and hitting the relevant button (2 for Rejuve, 3 for LB, 4 for regrowth, 5 for swiftmend etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadë</div><div class="date">08-04-2008, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was using Healbot, but it has gotten to be a little bit of a pain. I just recently started using Clique and Grid. Grid is a PITA to set up, but once set it's pretty nice (description: http://www.wowace.com/wiki/Grid and Dowload: http://files.wowace.com/cat-unitframe.html). Phae at Resto4Life did a decent write up on setting up Grid (http://www.resto4life.com/2008/06/25/grid-thinking-within-the-boxes/)<br />
<br />
So, now it's a similar set up as Healbot in that I can click on the unit frames to heal/buff/decurse but I also have some nice timers that show who (within the entire raid) is holding lifeblooms from me, if they are at a 1/2/3 stack and how long is left on the timer or has a Swiftmend-able hot on them from me or others.  <br />
<br />
It's definately made me faster on the draw and heal more with less overheal. <br />

I always found Grid too confusing to use :)<br />

Or rather... &quot;loved it&quot; as I'm presently retired for a few months.  Grid is a clean, small, minimalistic interface yet packs &quot;enough&quot; information so you can do what you need without a bunch of other addons.  Only problem is, configuring is difficult to figure out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have you looked at Instant Health (http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/12837/)? It may improve your healing response time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-15-2008, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instant Health is probably more critical for Priest and Pally's.  Druid healing is very proactive.  I'm not saying it doesn't have value, but overall, its probably not as critical as for other more reactive healers.</div></div><hr />
