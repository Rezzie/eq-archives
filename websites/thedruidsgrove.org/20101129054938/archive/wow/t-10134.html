I had resurrection sickness at the time.  I was just speaking in guild chat, not really paying much attention to anything and basically just waiting for res sickness to fade.  Then suddenly I was dead.<br />
<br />
I spun the camera around and saw a level 60 troll rogue stealthing out of the inn.  He killed me instantly with an ambush, then vanished.  Since I'm &quot;only&quot; 8 levels below him, he receives honour for the kill.  Whilst I have ressurrection sickness, I stand no chance against pretty much any class.<br />
<br />
Why do you get honour for killing people with resurrection sickness?  I don't see how this is fair.<br />

If you choose to be rezzed by the spirit healer you have to take responsibility for the limitations that it provides. Another player should not be punished for that. Sure it was a cheap shot, but all in the workings of the game I think. I believe it is just another reason to run back to your body.</div></div><hr />

Running back from there would have been equally hazardous, given that most of my gear was on 0 durability.<br />

I guess you're right though... I'm just bummed at getting one-hitted.. :)<br />

<br />
It does matter though, because it's rewarding them for ganking a particularly vulnerable player.<br />

Wait... am I missing something? You play on a PvE server, and you're complaining about getting ganked? Turn off pvp?</div></div><hr />

What I mean by doesn't matter is 5 things.<br />
<br />
1.  Nothing bad happens to you.  You don't really lose anything.<br />
<br />
2.  They are not competing with you for honor.  The more honor they get doesn't effect you and your honor rankings at all.<br />
<br />
3.  The system is full of cheats.  There are so many BG's that are rigged so that one team gives up so the other can get more honor more quickly.  When there are cheaters, it makes the system less appealing to compete in anyways.<br />
<br />
4.  The guy probably stinks at the game and feels good about himself that he killed someone.  You made someone feel good for a day.<br />
<br />
5.  In a war taking out your opponents weaknesses is what you are supposed to do.  Remember this isn't world of benicecraft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in this instance I did lose something.. either 20 minutes running back to my corpse (which is in menethil harbour inn) from the southshore graveyard, or I res at the SS graveyard and lose durability on all the items I carry.<br />
<br />
I see what you're saying about not competing with him for honour.  My point was that if it awards him honour for killing me while I have res sickness, it's providing him with a motive to do it.<br />
<br />
The guy probably did feel good about doing it tbh.  Sneaking into an inn to assassinate someone is a daring trick, even for a rogue.  It's just the last thing I would have expected right then, and it prompted me to wonder about the fairness of it.  I know this is _war_craft, but Blizzard still tend to do their utmost to make sure everything is fair and balanced.<br />
<br />
You don't get honour for killing players 20 levels lower than you are...  why should you get honour for killing someone with ressurection sickness?<br />

Maybe I'm cheap, but I never GY rez.  Even on alts, I think the highest level I've ever spirit rezzed is 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for a contrasting opinion, I agree more with Annik.  I'm pretty anti-pvp, have used the spirit healer even at 60, and would be pretty annoyed if some rogue came in and ganked me while I was in an inn and had rez effects.<br />
<br />
I do tend not to go AFK while I'm pvp flagged, just in case... but the rez effects would make it pretty tough regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ittles</div><div class="date">02-28-2006, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar situation.  In the Barrens I got too close to the horde pvp's and they came after me.  I simply ran knowing that if i don't attack them i won't get flagged.  What i forgot was that I had Thorns activated and as soon as i got hit, it flagged me, thus causing a level &quot;??&quot; to hop on his mount and track me down...2 shotting me, then camping my body and taunting me while waiting for me to respawn.  <br />
<br />
Is it fair?  Not at all...did it give him any sort of satisfaction that he killed someone at least 10 levels below him...probably.  Some people enjoy causing misery to others in that kind of way.  We just have to accept it as their style of play and try to avoid those encounters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GY ressing my druid costs me, oh, maybe 2g at most.  I can earn that in about 90 seconds on my hunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm cheap, but I never GY rez.  Even on alts, I think the highest level I've ever spirit rezzed is 20.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're cheap, or maybe I'm lazy.  :)<br />

That makes sense, sorry I was pretty confused at first. I would just suggest taking a griffen ride you're invincible then ride to and fro takes about 10 minutes anyways.<br />
Generally people 5 lvls lower then me I don't kill unless it's BG's ,they are in my farming spot, or they attack first. It seems the honor you get isn't worth it. All you can do I guess is brush it off get his name to try to kill him later.. :)</div></div><hr />

I can think of about 3 rogues on my server that can occasionally beat me, all of them in BWL-farming guilds.  Trouble is, I can't remember the guy's name..  :P<br />
