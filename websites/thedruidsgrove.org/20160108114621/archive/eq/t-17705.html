I am not sure why it is happening. Let me lay out what I do. I have my part of the dialogue hot buttoned so i have to say the right phrase quickly. I do not have anything targeted-- I just use general say. I get the text all the way to where the pet talks about druids and therr sensabilites. I DO NOT get the emote. I DO not have the 30 minutes to sing a song. This ends up with the pet telling me I did failed a simple task and that i should not be there when he returns. I do spam the song as much as possible but due to circumstaces beyound my control I can not move on with my epic. Can someone please give me feed back one way or the other-- having 0 feedback just leaves me where I am-- with no hope of progressing.</div></div><hr />

Did everything right-- pet stayed for the 30 min of saying o I am on the job.   As far as a yellow emote  being broadcast-- this did not happen.  tried 2 times with her.  Lost count how many times without her.  Oddly the only skeelie that would talk to me was the other skellie.  She suggested I pettition it.  She could not understand  why I did  not get the scroll.  After both skellies came back they depoped.  I am really frustrated with this epic.</div></div><hr />
