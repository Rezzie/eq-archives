<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VazapTheDruid</div><div class="date">12-21-2005, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way back when I used to play EQ, I played with a RL friend of mine. When I quit, he kept playing, and now he is level 70, really uber. I am going to come back to EQ. I've been playing around, trying out characters, decided I want a druid. My friend said he can give me as much money or items I need or want. :bubbrubb2 I'm trying to create a magelo of gear I want him to get me, but I don't know. I'm going to get multiple suits of gear, one for level 1 to 46 (powerleveled by him) then recommended stuff for 46 to 60 or 65, then another to 70, then we will be grinding out AAs in monster missions, or him grinding while I leave character in group. I love clickies and toys too so I'm going to be getting any cool toys I want to play with. I can get gear that is from old raid content or vex thal and stuff, no drop items and the like. Anybody bored at work or whatever wanna give me ideas on what I should get? (By the way, I kinda know how to play druids, I've leveled one from 1 to 50, no powerleveling, I just want this character to catch up and play with him in game.)</div></div><hr />
