Can other focus items stack together, such as Improved Damage IV and III for a total of seven or even better yet IV and IV for a total of 8. That would be like 40% improved damage. Because this sounds so nice to me, I am afraid that you guys are going to tell me no. If yes, I will be stocking up on Affliction Eff too.</div></div><hr />

For instance if I wear a Marked Runed Signet and a Runed Signet do I end up with 8 points regen or just the greater of the 2 earings?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendan</div><div class="date">04-20-2004, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats, hp regen, attack, and mana regen (up to 15) all stack, while only the highest percentage haste and focus effects take effect.  I'm not sure how damage shield effects on multiple items work, I would think that they stack as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devlin Monroe</div><div class="date">04-21-2004, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas all, first post. Yay me  :grin: <br />
Anyways, the I, II, III, and IV on focus effects indicate the level of spells that item will work on. For example:<br />
Mana Preservation I - will conserve mana on spells lvl 1- 29<br />
Mana Preservation II - will conserven mana on spells 1 - 44<br />
Mana Preservation III - will conserve mana on spells 1 - 60<br />
Mana Preservation IV - will conserve mana on spells 1 - 65<br />
(disclaimer, MP I and II might be off...been awhile, but you get the gist)<br />
<br />
Flowing Thought items will all stack, but only up to a maximum of 15. So you can have 15 FT1 items, or any other variation you want.<br />
<br />
Regen items work the same as flowing thought, except to a maximum of 35 rather than 15.<br />
<br />
Attack works the same again, except to a maximum of 250.<br />
<br />
Damage Shield works exactly the same once more, and to a maximum of 15 (not positive on this one) <br />
<br />
And on a side note, just while speaking of stacking, here comes haste just for fun.<br />
There are 4 potential hastes, (but only 3 that matter) that stack. They are:<br />
 - Item haste (this comes from something with a worn affect...think a cloak of flames or fbss) This is V0 haste<br />
 - Spell haste (this comes from a spell caster (enc,sha,bst) casting a haste spell on you. This also includes most bard songs (no bard and enc haste dont stack, with few exceptions to follow. This also includes any item that has clicky haste which creates a buff in your buff slots. These are V1 haste.<br />
 - Song haste. Like I said, there are exceptions. This exception, known as V2 haste, will stack with all other forms of haste, but will not take you over the haste cap. These songs are achieved in the low 50's for a bard, and grant low percentage increaes...if you have V0 and V1 haste, this will do nothing for you, as you will already be at the cap<br />
- Song haste (again). Later, bards will recieve V3 haste, or the vah shir line of songs. This will stack with V0 and V1 haste as well, and will push you over the haste cap.<br />
So, you can have ONE from each of the V's.<br />
V0 + V1 + V2 or V3 = Uber<br />
 :sleep:  :sleep:  :sleep: <br />
Dont know why I wrote that, first post, may as well make it a long one i guess...</div></div><hr />
