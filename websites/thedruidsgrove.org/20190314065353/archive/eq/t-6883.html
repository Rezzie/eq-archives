Wood Elf New Models druid with the leather type armor looking for new colors.  I have been basic green, then dark green, and then when crazy and went light blue with the color Red (123) Green (176) and Blue (255).  These have served their purpose but are worn, would like something new. Open to anything.<br />
<br />
Just wondering what colors everyone else was using and if you could maybe post a pic of your druidness.  I'll work on a pic of my character.  <br />
<br />
Also, if this has been discussed I am sorry.  Didn't have the time to scroll all of the posts.<br />

Another druid in my guild has gone with dark pastels - dark dusty rose and perwinkle. Looks really good on the leather model and I keep meaning to pick up some dyes and mess with dark pastels...</div></div><hr />

Where the boots are a deep royal blue, fading slightly up to an almost teal color, but not hard on the eyes. It's all soft.</div></div><hr />

My current outfit is all dark blue/purple.  I see a lot of people with the same colours... most of the colours available just dont look very good with the models and textures in game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mossrunner</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All brown. I forget the exact numbers.  Sounds kind of bland, but the look is cool, I think.  Started when I needed to change the gawdawful color on my Efreeti Boots to something else.  Picked brown to match my Chitin pants and stayed with it ever since.<br />
<br />
My helm has no grapich either.  (Black Hooded Something)  Until recieving this item, my char had been bald.  Putting it on made me have hair somehow.  I guess the non-graphical nature must have triggered some stupid code.  Anyway, I was so happy I stood in the Nexus for some time making sure by asking passers-by if they could see my hair. LOL<br />
<br />
I have forsaken any better helms so she won't have some ugly helm graphic.  My Druid is female and I like the look of her raven locks flowing free.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murias</div><div class="date">03-04-2004, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a long time I had everything dyed pale pink to match my PoM BP (very pale pink on half elf females). I was wearing plate pants though, and when I got leather pants again I looked, well, naked. I'm wearing Trilounhide pants now; the color is actually a kind of dark teal, but it looks more like a dark green. I dyed everything to match those. It's not too terrible, I guess. The dyes annoy me cause there are very few colors that actually dye leather well. Bleh.</div></div><hr />

The red is so practical with the blood stains as mentioned earlier and the corpse is easier to spot!   :flipbg: <br />
Also, every druid I saw was wearing green at first, so I wanted to look different.</div></div><hr />

Once I found the joys of a Amulet of Necropotence, no one has seen what I look like ingame.  :devil-lau But, without it I'm a black/dark-blue dyed human.  Oh, by the way, hi TDG community!  I've always just been a guest. But I figured, seeing as how I joined the Berserker boards and don't know a single thing about them...I might as well join my main's class boards at least.  :lmao:</div></div><hr />

My leggings are a lighter shade of pinkish red almost skin tone.  I've never seen anyone duplicate this yet.  And I get a ton of compliments!  I had been wearing the original color of my armor before that which seemed to be a dark sandy color.  Never saw anyone with that color either.  That was nice for winter... now that it's spring?  I wanted something light and colorful.  I'll try and send a pic.</div></div><hr />

My gloves and boots are still a deep green though - you can see some of me in my sig below...<br />
