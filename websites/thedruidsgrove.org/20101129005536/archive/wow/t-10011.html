Oh and to respond to your comment on the shadow priest thread buttons I was planning on going horde UD shadow priest. I like you like playing the healing classes not specced to heal I just like to have the ability to be self sustaining. Thank you very much for the insight..<br />
 <br />
Also do you read at teh prist haven post at all? Is is as good for priests as this one is for druids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea....shadow priests are awesome.  I have recently created a UD priest on the same server as my druid for fun.  I'm glad that I could help out with that.  <br />
<br />
I do go to the Priest's Haven also and find that they are helpful.  Those are the 2 forums I visit every day I can (usually when I'm at work).  I highly recommend it.  <br />

I am a lil rusty on my Shadow Priest skills....but it's all coming back now that I have one again.  If you ever have any questions don't hesitate to ask me or the Priest's Haven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing about The Priest's Haven is there are not usually as many members online at one time like TDG.  So you might have to wait a lil bit for a response (however if I am on TDG I am usually on TPH).  I have found quite a few druids that go there too because they have priest alts.</div></div><hr />
