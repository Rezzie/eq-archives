Last night, I was grouped with my hubby who had already completed one of the quests I was working on.  None of the quest pieces would drop for me until we disbanded.<br />
It doesn't seem right to me that this is working as designed.  It actually forced me to solo when I wanted to group with my lovely undead sweetie  :confused: !</div></div><hr />

We've been playing since June, so sounds like it was a run of bad luck for you :-(</div></div><hr />

I've had runs where i've spent an hour and a half getting no drops of the item i need, then i get them all at once.</div></div><hr />

Even corpses that are &quot;their turn&quot; to loot will sparkle for you to loot when your piece drops.<br />
<br />
If you did, that's definatly gotta be a bug or a massive string of bad luck (my guess is bug). Personally I never ran into it. All the groups i've been in, reguardless of everybody's  quest, has always correctly dropped our pieces. Just remember you CANNOT rely on somebody else's view since the piece will never drop for them if they have already completed the quest.</div></div><hr />

Now that I know it's not supposed to work that way, I will do a more systematic and thorough test.  I did loot every corpse and got all kinds of other junk, but next time I will keep track of the exact number and the length of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-10-2004, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to let you know, Gala - my warlock had a collection type quest where I had to kill Mob_A for 5 of Item_A.  A &quot;bad run of luck&quot; for me in that particular quest was killing ~30 mobs before I got the 5 drops I needed.  My Tauren ran into similar luck where she had to collect something from a flying bird thingie - stupid rare bird wouldn't drop it's &quot;skin&quot; (or whatever) until I killed like 12 of them.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure it helped anything but we did wonder that one time about it too :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galadhriel</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was checking the group windows and noticed he had also formed a raid somehow.  We redid the group without being a raid and we were able to quest again.  The raid notes do say that you cannot get quest items while in a raid.  So I guess it was user error (or blame the UI!). :ohwell:</div></div><hr />
