<br />
And I know if your behind someone, they can't see you unless they are a realllllyyyyy higher level than you; but what about the sides and in front? My friend said she could sometimes see me if I was at her side or in front of her, but she's also 4 levels higher than me.<br />
<br />
Heehee, thanks for inudulging me. :D<br />

There's also an increased chance they'll spot you if you move (as opposed to standing still).</div></div><hr />
