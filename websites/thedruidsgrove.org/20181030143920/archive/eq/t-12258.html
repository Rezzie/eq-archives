My druidess is now nearly 53 levels young, and so far I have spend most of that time quadding in Cobalt Scar (&lt;-- thats slowing down alot) or rotting in PoJ. I am quite interested in DoN armor and augs. And was wondering if lower levels can even attempt them. I have done a few of the faction quests (they give good xp in the 50's.) but, wasn't sure if I could actually put together a group of 50-60 and do a real mission. <br />

Does anyone know or has anyone tried?</div></div><hr />

Takes the lvl of all players and adds them to gether and divides it by 6 I think and the mobs in the mission should be around that lvl. i have done greators with as many lvl 70's as possible to help me get more crystals and I am only 67 almost 68.</div></div><hr />
