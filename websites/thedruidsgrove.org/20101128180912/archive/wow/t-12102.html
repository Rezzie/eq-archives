<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amerginus</div><div class="date">10-26-2007, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone. <br />
<br />
I am new to the tanking world of the Drood. Smiles. I since I got kitty have lived kitty for most of my WoW time. Recently after hitting 70 my wife wanted us to join a guild to work on raiding and better gear. I Agreed but everywhere we turned guilds were asking me to be resto. Tree form. And so inorder to get into the secret room and see the  man behind the curtain so to speak. I respec'd. Well let me tell you, my questing and such came to a halt as I really could not take on level 70 mobs for the most part. WEll after doing Kara for a few weeks. I was hating my druid. THe fantazmo world of my kitty was neutered and I was feeling it. Sooo I told the guild. I was going back to feral.. And Guess what .. I was now happier playing again.. but.. was being treated as the 2nd class citizen. I can understand their feelings at losing a healer, but if I was not enjoying the game what was the use of it all any way? I would have wanted to stop playing in the end. <br />
<br />
But now let me continue on.. (( Yea I know for being quite on the forums for so long .. I sure did get long winded :) ))<br />
<br />
SO we found a new guild my wife and I and wow. not only were they letting me go feral. OT and Kitty in kara. They were inviting me along to do Gruul in a 3rd OT type setting. This was awsome. SO I buckled down and got to work on my tanking gear. All Pre-kara of course.<br />
<br />
I have def. found it hard to keep aggro as my guild usually does not wait for me to gain the rage I need to lacerate and such to keep the mob lovin on me instead of my healer/Ranged DPS. I do find myself chasing after mobs and the object of the mobs affection now running to get away form the mob and in essence me. Sigh. SO I am like trying to tell them on vent.. To me come to me. <br />
<br />
I think it is def. frustrating when I have really no rage and I have to do a pull. I usually try and moonfire .. go bear .. then lacerate/mangle/ roar.. depending what's up. But there are times I just do not have rage for a couple of seconds I am standing there feeling silly. But I am working on it and in time I will learn to use the force. <br />
<br />
Well in any case everyone.. HI. It is a pleasure to introduce myself to you all. I will work on getting a sig down.. smiles. take care .. <br />

Sounds like quite an endeavor you've gone through there. Feel free to ask any questions here; there are plenty of feral druids around.<br />
<br />
I'm restro myself, previous Balance, but I don't mind healing. I kind of like it. For druids, it's quite unique and it's not spamming just one or two buttons. But I totally understand your inability to quest. That's why I keep a balance set of gear on me at all times; when I need to farm (dailies, etc), I use that. I'm not as effective as I was being Balance, but I'm good enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
See ya around on the forums.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you as a long time tank in KZ, it only gets worse.  I swapped to a new tactic.  As a high end bear tank, you will never be able to have a great experience in a non heroic or non raid instance without being beat on two or three mobs.  I've taken to swapping my pulls to pull two or three mobs unless I'm in a raid.  Raid mobs will generate the rage you need, but standard mobs won't.  (Who knew 30k armor was a bad thing...)<br />
<br />
Most people will give you a second or two extra when you are pulling multiple mobs as they know it takes you a second or two to build agro on both mobs.  I have found though, DPS is a lot more twitchy in TBC.  They generally don't grant you the 5 seconds head start to build rage and threat any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2 years healing. Thought those who specc'd Feral were the ones giving Droods a bad name.<br />
<br />
Specc'd Feral to complete the grind to Exhalted for Scryers one week.<br />
<br />
Have never looked back.<br />
<br />
I still carry my healing gear (+1200 Healing) but I haven't healed in more than 6 months.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

I was resto from 1 - 66 then one day just got tired of not being able to grind effectively I respecc'ed feral and haven't looked back...<br />
<br />
I still do receive tells from people who knew me as resto to heal ... I take the offer if I am comfortable with the group... I have just a little over 1k + heal not bad from collecting gear that no healer wanted...<br />
<br />
When I do regular instances I pull twice the mob to generate enough rage... I do scare my party here and there but to become effective you almost need to ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE resto grinding will get a nice boost with 2.3.  I know I had to limit my farming to fishing and herb gathering when I was full tree.<br />
<br />
I missed healing in raids, but I didn't want to respec resto, so up came my shaman and she is resto and I love healing with her :)</div></div><hr />

Plate FTW!<br />
<br />
Plus you can whup ass in Arena then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">10-26-2007, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shamans would be interesting. There are so few of them in the upper levels. We have two shamans, both enhancement, if I recall right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">10-27-2007, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to the TDG forums Amerginus!<br />
<br />
I'm elated to see more and more fellow druids starting to get involved in our forums. I know there are probably tons more people that view these forums than posting.<br />
<br />
@Ravnia, <br />
for your healing alt I'd personally take a Priest just because I &lt;3 priests (and they are hybrid too in that if you change your mind you could always go shadow). Pally healing is awesome so  I guess it comes down to personal preference. Bit of a coin toss if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">10-29-2007, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooh more newcomers...but you're still big and 70 unlike me.  *sigh*  44 now and it seems so far away.<br />
<br />
All you feral druids make me happy.  I stand resolute in my pro-feral standing against my friend who thinks that balance is the best (despite having never played a druid).  She keeps saying I should respec.  But I'm a stubborn cow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">10-29-2007, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Balance is a very viable leveling spec, especially after 60.  I found feral to just suit me very well.  Though I definitely like healing ( thus my resto Shaman ), but tanking with my face will always have a special place in my heart.</div></div><hr />
