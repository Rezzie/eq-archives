I cast a Damage Shield on Necro and Pet, I then let Necro cause some of his own damage.......then when Mob is under 50% health, I was trying to finish it off with my lvl 56 Druid.<br />
BUT my Necro was not experience from that kill. The only way I was getting experience with the Necro was when my Druid didnt do any damage.<br />
I thought if a Mob was under 50% health, anyone could finish it off and the person causing more than the 50% damage go the experience.<br />
When did they change this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">06-19-2005, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like most of the damage was caused by thorns (unattributed) or your druid (if he started attacking at 40%).  Your druid did more actual damage than your necro, since the necro doesn't get credit for the thorn damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just look at the necro screen how much damage he and his pet does, and dont do more with the druid.<br />
<br />
At level 16 it shouldnt be necessary anyways to help, with the lvl 49 druid buffs on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aderel</div><div class="date">06-19-2005, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way to do it is to DS yourself and get all mobs to beat on you instead of the twink. You just poke in at least 1 damage per mob with your twink and it'll get all the exp. It's a whole lot easier to keep yourself alive against a few mobs that are a few levels higher than the twink. I've used this method up to level 50ish, after that it becomes kinda inefficient. (think velks was the highest zone I did it in, DS killing ~4 spiders at a time.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, the person that gains the EXP is the one that does the most damage to the mob.  Damage Shields are, however, not considered being delivered by anyone.  So, if the low level character does 30% of the damage, the druid 30.00000001% and the damage shield the rest, the druid will get the credit.<br />
<br />
I found that doing any damage to a mob early on meant doing too much.  Later on, I was able to start adding some minor clicky dots to help without a problem.</div></div><hr />

I don't remember the rules for this, but at level 16 there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to land a tap spell to get a point of damage in for XP credit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">06-19-2005, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the other way around.

So in other words, even if a mob is almost dead you can still ks your necro.  I have never really tested this myself, just was warned by the guild PL pro about this danger years ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omcduffy</div><div class="date">06-20-2005, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a neat trick to try... get an enchanter to rune your plee, cast wrath of the wild on the plee along with your ds buffs (whatever).  have said plee go cast a nuke or hit a mob for 1pt of damage or more.  make sure the rune stays on the plee.  the mob will take the wotw damage + DS damage every hit as long as the rune is on the plee (ie it wont drop wotw in 1 hit like normal as long as rune is still on the target).  so said mob will be taking close to 700 damage a swing as long as wotw is on with the rune.  Now thats power leveling.<br />
<br />
It is also a nice trick to use in Intukta vs the Curse Callers.  Have your enchanters &quot;rune tank&quot; them with a wotw on.  that last one will be at 20% if they happen to live the whole fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would always make sure that my higher druid had no buffs on that would cause damage and then use as high of heal as i could on the toon i was pl'ing.<br />
the druid would get hit (whoopee) and the pl'd toon could just work away at singles if necessary...<br />
<br />
I would always snare with the druid and cast careless lightning when the mob turned...<br />
<br />
worked fine for me no matter what level<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smaktow</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are a couple ways of dealing w/pl situations... 1:let the low level do all the damage 'til over 50% (meaning no ds) then have the high level finish it off. 2:w/damage shields, both low and high levels get them, but the high level simply absorbs the mobs hits w/o doing additional damage and the low level must get in 1 hit on the mob... doesn't matter if 99.999 % of the damage is from the sheilds, as long as the low level does more direct damage than the high level... so, no, i don't think anything has been changed in the formula for pl'ing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beatslayer</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">set your bot autofollowing your main.  mem the bot's level one nuke.  make a hotkey for assist main; pause 5; cast lvl one nuke.  <br />
<br />
start the madness:  DS up your druid to the max, then snare a mob, hit the bot's autonuke key once.. find a new mob, snare it, hit the auto nuke key.. repeat till you got a train of 20-40 mobs beating on you, pop SotW, spam sit, watch your bot gain levels like it's goin outta style.<br />
<br />
Just make sure your snare keeps agro on all the mobs, instead of prox agro gettin your bot beat on.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Method #2 is almost the same.. just train everything you can find into a corner and let it beat on you till the mobs are consistently around 5% hp.. then cast the bot's lowest level PB AE dmg spell, if you did this right, the mobs will ignore the bot, and continue to pound the druid till they commit DS suicide, giving the bot solo xp for each kill.<br />
<br />
edit:  using these tricks, i was able to PL my cleric bot into his 50's before his starting stack of food and water was gone.  It also makes it easier if you find mobs that don't flee when dying.</div></div><hr />

Just grab some chanter buffs(which won't wear off) and chain cast in the pool for skillups. It will go fast. Melee skills  however are not so easy. I like to let the PLee get hit for a while to max defensive skills first, then go to the method of letting the druid get hit. That is faster, because you can get a much higher DS on the high level char, especially if you have a DS clicky or DS on gear.</div></div><hr />

They fixed it with arcane rune a long time ago.  They fixed it with other runes (apparently) yesterday:<br />

Fixed the issue with Wrath of the Wild that caused it to last until a rune expired</div></div><hr />
