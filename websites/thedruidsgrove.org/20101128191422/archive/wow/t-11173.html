<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrdim</div><div class="date">10-15-2006, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I myself use auctioneer (http://norganna.org/discuss/3). Its real handy to see prices for items you want to put in AH<br />
<br />
also Decursive is in my opinion a must have for all decursing classes<br />
and ofcourse CTMod (http://www.ctmod.net)<br />
<br />
and am currently experimenting with a new healingmod :Heart<br />
<br />
have a look at http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/ for these mods :) :cool:</div></div><hr />

i have been wondering about mods for a very long time.... <br />
<br />
<br />
i always see the map cords on guys i look up for a quest i cant find.. <br />
<br />
what mod would be good for that.. <br />
<br />
and a good mod for a feral Druid.... i mostly wanna see the % of health not just the bar and not how much he has... ohhh and is there a good place to search for them incase i need one for the future...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">10-15-2006, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Myself, I use Cosmos, Titanpanel, and Auctioner. I am thinking of picking up Ctmod--from what I have heard it allows one to see everyone elses healthbars? Or something. I don't know if I want it right now, but as I always main-heal I might get it.<br />
<br />
With Cosmos comes many things. I particularly like the following:<br />
Feralskills (very helpful. What it does is combine all of your feral attacks into 4 buttons)<br />
Health/Mana bar displays (this is the reason why I do so well in healing, especially the percentage displays)<br />
Quickloot<br />
Arcane-casting bars<br />
Better tooltips<br />
Alphamap (Able to view the map while I run and fight? I love it)<br />
All-in-one inventory<br />
And many other things.<br />
<br />
With Titanpanel comes:<br />
Co-ords<br />
Clock<br />
Honor counter<br />
Bag space<br />
Durability %<br />
Item Bonuses<br />
And other things.<br />
<br />
If you're interested, cosmos can be found here:<br />
http://www.cosmosui.org/<br />
I highly recommend it. It'll take a little while to configure everything... But the number of helpful add-ons it has is amazing.<br />
<br />
And I believe this is the right link for titanpanel:<br />
http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1797<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy them if you take them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Changing from healing gear to feral gear on the fly, in the middle of combat, is imo a must have mod.</div></div><hr />
