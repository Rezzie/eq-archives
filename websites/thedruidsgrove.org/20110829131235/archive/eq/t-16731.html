What's soloing like in the newer expansions? Is it possible to solo in this new built for raiders expansions? Any particular strategies to keep in mind and any particular line of spells to be looking for? <br />

To give you an idea how long its been for me, I'm wearing Alysian armor, LOL.<br />

The Devs obviously want us druids as a secondary druid and it seems that the rest of the EQ world agrees as if u will EVER get a group it will only most likely be to heal unless u group with friends. For soloing, yes it is possible just need to look for the spots. In TSS era the mammoths in Icefall is a good solo spot for a druid since u can charm kite, in TBS era The Buried Sea zone is good as most dont summon and so is Jewel of Attiki however be careful for in Attiki the mobs warp like crazy, in the most recent, the SoF era u should go to Loping Plains and either do the gators or the worgs so u can charm kite.</div></div><hr />

Great info. thanks. Yesterday for no other reason than simply to explore I went to get the Arcstone Port, not sure how often I'll use it. I went to The Steppes, but the spells were 70+, I'm currently 68. I traveled to The Barren cost to check out The Buried Sea and got buried by a lightblue Skel, completely kicked my butt. <br />
<br />
It was an add I picked up as I was just floating along to one of the dock areas. I still haven't figured out how to get to The Buried Sea. You have to buy a ticket?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just get on the boat in Barren Coast... tickets are for instance zones in TBS and not needed in this case.<br />
<br />
Once you are there find the druid ring on Monkey Island and buy your port spells.<br />
<br />
Get maps from mapfiend.net<br />

I came back in April, best thing I can suggest is ask lots of questions, read all the boards, you will be back in the swing of things in no time. It was VERY overwhelming coming back after being gone for 5 years but in about 2 weeks I was at least comfortable again. I still havent figured a lot of things out, but I figure it out as I need it.</div></div><hr />
