I'm thinking of trying it just to see how I'd do.  I'm told 2.4 did wonders for this build.  <br />
<br />
Do any of you have one of the Dreamstate builds and currently heal raids with it?  If so, which one do you have and tell me why you prefer it?  <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I still stand by if you want to raid as a healer spec full healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes, I do.  But, if there's a way that I can be even stronger at soloing while maintaining the same healing power I'm used to, I'd like to try it.<br />
<br />
I know another druid who's always been full resto and has just recently switched to the Dreamstate HT build.  He absolutely loves it.  Loves the strength, the heals, the works.    <br />
<br />
I guess I just wanted to hear other &quot;dreamstate&quot; opinions.  :o</div></div><hr />

im sorry if i ask. but does your friend raid??<br />
i couldn't imagine taking a dreamstate-healer into a raid.<br />
not as main-healer. cause dreamstate healing is soooo weak in raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  At first, he just wanted to &quot;experiment&quot; with a new build that would allow him to remain a strong healer and become a force on the battleground.  He put a lot of thought and research into his build and I have to say, it's worked out quite nicely for him.<br />
<br />
He continues to top the healing meters for both 10 and 25 man's.  I know that a druid will likely top the healing meters anyway, but I've since raided with him, and he's just as strong and as good as he ever was.<br />
<br />
Mind you, he knows his game.  Much better than I will ever know mine. :rolleyes:   <br />
<br />
As a Resto tree you fill a very nice healing niche(hots)  As a Dreamstate you bring nothing(healing) that a pally can't do better.<br />
<br />
Which is why, I'm going to keep my ToL spec.  I know my ToL, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  And, it just so happens that I regularly raid with a healing Pally.  So....<br />
<br />
Magellan have you try buying the new cheap pvp boomkin set?<br />
<br />
No, but I will.  Never scoped out balance gear before, what should I go for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cloth :&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously tho.. :&gt;  There's a pvp &quot;start&quot; set of gear... vindicator's stuff, or something like that.  That would be a good start I guess.<br />

Can you post a link to your friend's build?  I'm very interested to see it.<br />

Thanks!<br />

My PvP druid is thinking of going from the standard 8/11/42 to a Dreamstate build.  Maggie - does your friend do any serious PvP (arena) with that spec in a primary healing role?</div></div><hr />

I'll have to get his permission first.  But, I shall ask.  :shuffle:</div></div><hr />

Thank you very much.  Very kind of you to go to the trouble.<br />
<br />
I hope my question did not cross the lines of good etiquette!<br />
