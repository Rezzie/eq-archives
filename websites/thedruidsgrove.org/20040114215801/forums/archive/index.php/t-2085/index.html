<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moridin the Mad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 51 druid and I've tried this several times.  The first time I pulled a warrior with ensare and all his buddies agrod on me.  The shaman SOWed the warrios and I died.  The only way I can think of is to use Harmony of Nature, but it 100 mana a pop.  If you have to harmony 4 or 5 guys that is 500 mana which you will have to spend medding back later.  What do you guys recommend?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've never killed them (ally =), but everyone who does uses harmony of nature, as you mentioned.<br />
<br />
The 500 mana is just the cost of doing business!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kerech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At level 51 you'll have trouble quadding them I think. Better to do wyverns for a few levels first.  Your mana pool may be too low at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Save the otters !!! They too cute lol ! I had  to farm 10 stacks of othmir furs cause I really need them at that time. Killed thousands of innocent otters. /cry Max kos now and I want to kick myself for doing that. <br />
<br />
Anyways. Killing them with Harmony of Nature. Harmony the shamans and nameds. well harmony does take a bit of mana. If it bother you too much you need more mana then. Pull 1 ottmir warrior and all 4 wil come to you. you better run fast and snare them all. Pull them to the top of the cliff ( if you non kos to COV that is. If you are. don't even think about touching otters. ) Kill them there. Some disadventage when killing them. 1. you wil need some way to buy the baking /brewing stuff from them. they are the only merchant in EQ who sells them. 2. you wil not able to quad wyverns after kos to otters. ( can't quad them in the beach anymore. need to find some way on top.) 3. No fishing for you !!<br />
<br />
There is a way to fix the faction. Killing lots lots of _____ ( something I forgot sorry ) in EW. Is a slow way really =/ <br />
<br />
Give /hugs to ottmirs !! I suggest you not  to kill them ! =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;2. you wil not able to quad wyverns after kos to otters. ( can't quad them in the beach anymore. need to find some way on top.)&quot;<br />
<br />
I never understood why people dragged the wyverns down to the beach.  It takes longer, and you need to keep lev up all the time (most wyvern killers are too low to have SoE and don't have the componentless lev, so it's a pain to keep up all the time).  I never had any trouble avoiding adds, and never trained anyone either.  Just keep em up top =)<br />
<br />
I used the long &quot;runway&quot; from portal to SS tower as my kite area.  If you kite just inside the line where the flat part starts to angle down towards the sea, you will avoid agro from any mobs still up along the sides there, as well as the cobalt drake flying down the middle of that area.  This area is long enough to get in 3 nukes before turning around and going back the other way.  Also, it's flat, so no worry about rocks/dips scattering your quad.  And since you are well to one side of the &quot;runway&quot;, KOS peeps running along there can easily avoid you by sticking a little bit to the other side.<br />

PS - Hadn't noticed original poster is 51.  Yeah, stick to wyverns, Othmir will be too tough for you I think.  And wyverns will be all blue, still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moridin the Mad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for all the tips.  I was more curious to know how to quad the othmir because I know that in a few levels wyverns won't give me enough exp.  Also, there are times when all the wyverns are taken.  Thanks for all the help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;I never understood why people dragged the wyverns down to the beach. &quot;<br />
<br />
Because Vyolcan and Azzurake hurt, a LOT. 8o <br />
<br />
Beach = no 500 point Cold based DD nuke and dispell from unwanted named adds. ;) <br />
<br />
And the mobs that +othimir faction are the Ulthork in Eastern Wastes. I was warmly to Othimir long before I ever visited CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nimchip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i tried othmir at 56, so i wouldn't recommend doing them till at least 55...</div></div><hr />

Quadded there for 5 levels, never had a problem with it.  I assume you are/were non-KOS to CoV?  If not, then that might be the difference.  There's only four drakes, and they have set paths, so they are easy to avoid.  And with Yvolcarn, as long as you don't pull him by accident (i.e. he's at one of the non-single spawn points, and you forget to harmony), you should be good.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, Ally with CoV. <br />
<br />
But I found that both Volc and Az if trained over your quad tend to divert attention to the quadee at the most unopertune time. 8o <br />
<br />
Also I have found that folks tend to try to 'help' you too much up top. One quad I had of Bulthar, as one ensnare wore off a wizard who was watching me tossed his AE snare on my pull to 'help' me.. Yup help me end up trying to reensnare 4 angry mobs when his overwrote mine and they all wore off his in 30 secs at the same time.. Please don't help. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kahlia Girlie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's worth mentioning that once you ding 56 (pretty sure this is the level it happened for me), you only need to use harmony on the Chief.  Meaning you can single pull otters from the other two camps at will, and from Chief camp once you Harmony him.<br />
<br />
Other things to consider are that the otters have about 5500 hp, the wyverns, if memory serves, are only about 4500.  So do the math to figure out how many ae casts that is and you'll understand the mana requirements.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for you, the old harmony no longer works here.  It was a lot less mana for lower druids to pull the otters pre-pop than it is now.  So depending on your mana pool, you may want to skip otters till you get a couple levels.<br />
<br />
The route I took, and the one I'd suggest to you, is wyverns to 51, then raptors to 54 or 55, then return to otters.  One of the very awesome changes for quad kiting to go in is that you no longer need a boat to get into TD.  Which means it takes much less time to get to raptors, and it's a LOT easier to get a cleric to res you - just drag body to docks and it's a 5 min job for the cleric.<br />
<br />
It's also a lot less camped now than it used to be when the 58+ druids had nowhere else to xp (like PoN/PoD), so you will probably be able to get raptors whenever you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No clue on Otter HPs, never killed one, but the wyverns are definitely in the 3000 HP range.  They are all between 38 and 42, so the HPs are definitely appropriate for that level.<br />
<br />
Another factor to keep in mind when levelling, is that there is a bonus to XP when both PC and mob are 51 or higher, and the mob is no more than 5 levels below the level of the PC.  And the bonus increases for each level the gap decreases, becoming quite considerable for mobs above the PCs level.<br />
<br />
So once you hit 51, it pays to find a hunting spot where the mobs are also at least 51.  That's why PoP zones were so incredible when released, huge ZEMs, and pretty much all mobs are 51+, so people were attracted by the great XP rate.<br />
