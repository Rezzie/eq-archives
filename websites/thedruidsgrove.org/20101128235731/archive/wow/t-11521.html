<br />
I just want to be able to solo a bit when i am not finding a group, i'm full resto right now (Treeform), but the killing is soooo slow.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for a link to a standard 30/21 build, I think and then maybe go to 30/31?  What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">02-01-2007, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is still possible to heal 5mans as a feral build, just not as easy.<br />
<br />
You could just go the standard 0/30/21 build I suppose which isn't too bad but Mangle is very VERY nice...<br />
<br />
With the new talents out since I used a 0/30/21 build, you might want to experiment by yourself on what talents to get. Just work up to Heart of the Wild and NS and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />

Works really for him to both heal and grind and pvp.  He absolutley never dies.<br />
<br />
Personally I started 0/41/10, and have since taken OoC, NG, and put 2 in Natures Focus.  I'm gonna put 1 more in NF for close to 50% chance to avoid interruption), then 3 in Primal Tenacity.  I never die either, as I just kill things way too fast.  I haven't actually healed an instance, but I have about +500 healing gear so it shouldn't be a problem.  Esp with lifebloom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhroam</div><div class="date">02-01-2007, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It all depends on your +healing.  I'm a full feral build and haven't had a problem healing any 5man I've done so far... and I'm usually the healer.  Of course I hit the outlands with 570 healing (just broke the 700 mark last night).<br />
<br />
Another interesting build you might consider is balance.  A balance druid is a better healer than a feral druid due to several really nice talents.  I went from balance to feral when the xpac came out and lost like 60 +healing and 30 or 40mp5.<br />
<br />
I chose to respec because I've been leveling wit ha couple of hunters.  I couldn't keep up with them without constantly drinking.  When I was soloing I hardly had to drink due to my heightened mana regen.  As a moonkin, you get 25% of your int in +healing/damage and 10% of your int in MP5.  Both of these make you a kickass healer.  <br />
<br />
What you get as a full feral build is 23% higher int and if you take the talent 50% of your strength in +healing.<br />
<br />
There's a lot more nice moonkin gear out there now.  My stomache turns every time I turn one down for a feral piece =]<br />
<br />
Whichever spec you go, I HIGHLY recomend Naturalist... it's probably one of the best talents in all 3 of our trees.<br />
<br />
In any case, when you move from full resto, the first thing you're gonna miss is your swift heals.  I was 30/21 for a long time and the loss of NS was definitely noticed.  The loss of swiftmend and tree form will definitely be hard.  You will need to relearn how to heal.  It's not rejuv+SM any more... There's a lot more rejuv's and regrowths thrown in because their fast (LB too at 64).  Just keep in mind the first few instance runs will be VERY painful when you get used to your new spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cant rememeber the exact build but i've got 46 points iirc in feral. (not yet taken the new 50% of STR to +healing as not convinced its necessary?)<br />
<br />
however i do have around +530 healing in my full heal gear and around 8.3k mana self buffed with just MotW and approx 40ish MP5. <br />
<br />
i've never been resto. previously when raiding a lot (BWL with Neffy on farm and AQ40) i was more like 31/20 and never had a problem with healing.<br />
<br />
waiting to see how i fair at 70 in the new raid instances.<br />
<br />
so i'd go for what you feel you need or would like to have to allow you to do feral - ie do you use kitty more when levelling than bear ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrMags</div><div class="date">02-02-2007, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For solo grinding/questing cat in dps gear with a scattering of +int is the way to go. There is a very good hybrid helm that drops in Sethekk Halls in Auchidoun and blue BOE shoulders with good melee stats and some int/spirit as well.<br />
<br />
Personally I find that for single target sustainable dps kitty far outpaces bear, but if you pull 3 or 4 same level mobs you are going to have to go bear to survive. Then again I'm sitting at 70 with a 2/45/14 build and pretty good gear so both forms hit like a ton of bricks.</div></div><hr />

For obvious reasons I chose to go full Feral when BC hit. At level 70 i'm still Feral, and healing 5 mans with ease. Granted I can't main heal, even with 1124 healing. I honestly didn't expect to, especially considering you really need two healing classes to be safe.<br />
<br />
Quite honestly you don't need 30 points in Resto to be a good healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True!<br />
Being a good healer comes more down to skills and brain, since 30 points in any tree still dont make u a better player. ^^<br />
Talents can be balanced out with gear, gear can be balanced out with talents, it all comes down to you and your gear.<br />
If you are lvl 60 and have +150 healing, then i guess u would be better off taking some resto talents to offset your crappy healing gear. On the other hand if you have good healinggear (i guess 5-600+) then you can heal pretty well being full feral.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ohhh and none of this applies if your a total n00b behind the keyboard ^^ Then even a full resto spec won't help u ^^  (i know 1 druid like that ^^)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">02-05-2007, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only problem with a 41+ pt feral build, is the inability to handle spiked dmg. u can only work as fast as your quickest heal... which is 2sec. premeditated healing can only go so far.<br />
<br />
when things get heated, and you're a feral druid MT healing, your team mates will have to compensate for what you're lacking. this is where group synergy comes into play. players who know both their own class, as well as the other classes, will know how to stay alive. frost traps, feign deaths, frost novas, poly, fear, banish, warstomp, etc etc.<br />
<br />
i'm back to a feral build right now, and i'm loving it. :] i'll probaby remain feral until i farm enuff for an epic flying mount. i have so many quests to finish!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">02-14-2007, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm specced 0/50/11 and I have not had any problems main healing in 5 mans. I recently finished Shadow Lab though, so I still have some more to go. I have a little over 12,000 mana (with MoTW) and +900 healing gear, plus an additional +240 healing from NI. I completely own in feral kitty gear, topping mages/rogues/warlocks when I go feral and still switching out when needed to Main Heal. It all comes down to timing, mana utilization, spell selections and support (pots, scrolls and food). I still love the changes to the Druid and feel comfortable tanking, healing, and dps in anything I've been in so far. <br />
When main healing I tend to hit first with a High level Hot then follow up with a downranked HT. This keeps the tank full until I need to repeat. If the MT is going down faster, I'll hit them with all 3 of my Hot's and then top out with downgraded HT (like Rejuv, Regrowth, Lifebloom, HT7) this has been what I've used even on Murmur. I have plenty of mana and if I did get into a bad situation, I'm alchemy so I carry super mana pots and I always have an innervate, this combo usually gives me close to unlimited mana. Oh, and if DPS pulls aggro Lifebloom and Rejuv are perfect until aggro is regained by tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaeya</div><div class="date">06-28-2007, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This will repeat some of what I said in the other thread, but these threads are interesting. I'm surprised several people are saying they healed as full feral druids (something a good friend of mine also said), because even though I always hauled around a set of int/healing gear as a feral druid, I almost never used it because I'd do emergency backup healing at best. Not only did people not want me as a healer when I told them I was mostly feral spec'd, but I couldn't imagine pulling it off, either. <br />
I respec'd to full resto recently with the problems I described in the other thread, so I'm now eyeing the 30/31 build (or given I'm only level 63, it'd be a 23/31 build). Is this truly viable as a main healer? (Not necessarily for heroic/70s raid content, I'm happy going back to full resto at 70 if necessary).</div></div><hr />

It's DIFFERENT from healing as any other class, though, because Druid healing really has to be proactive.  You need to anticipate damage rather than react to it in most cases.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want to try to solo heal a heroic for that reason, but there have been some heroic fights where we lost with a single healer, but won when I switched to healing alongside the primary.</div></div><hr />

I feel your pain ... so far I have been lucky and able to join people when questing; especially when the quest requires a group.<br />
<br />
In the case I have to go out by my self, instead of using car or bear form (which I was able to do before the Outlands) I am in caster mode... a lot of faerie fire, entangled roots, moonfire and starfire (repeat) ....LOL ... As you may have guessed I consume a lot of water ... On a usual night I drink up over 100x of water from those helpful mages ...<br />
<br />
Good luck...</div></div><hr />
