<br />
And it pretty is hard to win against anything but Warriors in a duel.  A smart Hunter will just fear beast and Bandage.  Rogues, don't even bother, they have so many ways of playing that figuring out just one will frustrate you when you fight one who does something totally different.  Priests can kill us while watching the chapelle show at a house party.  We don't stand a chance against Shamans, a Paladin will usually out mana you (resulting in your imminent death).  <br />
<br />
Beating a warrior is simple.  You just simply out tank them.  Our ability to self heal while in Bear form gives us an edge up because it saves us the mana required to shift in and out for a heal.  Once you do need to shift out, just Bash, with improved bash, you get a 4 second stun, which is plenty of time to cast Regrowth, and Rejuvination, then shift back into bear.  Depending on your mana pool, you may just want to Innverate yourself to counter-balance the mana cost of shifting back into Bear and tank the Warrior some more until you need to heal, at which point, Bash is probably recharged, you have a full mana bar again, and you haven't even used Nature's Swiftness as a back-up.  Warrior should be about to go down by then.<br />
<br />
I used to think Cat form was best for Mages, but I was wrong.  Once again, Bear Form ftw.  The mage knows you are coming if you try to catform and stealth, so if they are Human, they have 2 options, use the racial ability and Fireblast you.  Or just AoE and pop you out.  Any other race has the option of just AoE to pop you out.  With bear form, you have the extra health, and still hit em pretty hard since they are caster's.  When they blink, you just Feral Charge and keep attacking.  Bash, and heal when you need to, but make sure they have already used blink, other wise it's a wasted 1 minute timer.   <br />
<br />
Those are in a duel situation, in a PvP aspect when you are faced with an enemy, the cards in your deck are completely different.  Which is why I avoid duels, because the surprise element, and fear of loss/death aren't present.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I am stupid, for realizing you are only 39.  My strategy is coming from a finished build at level 60  :physics: .  Imma dork.</div></div><hr />

I duel very little. Please remember that duelling is different from PvP. Duelling is when you challenge someone (usually from your same faction) and throw down the flag. PvP means you are running BG or have spontaneous PvP while questing/travelling in contested areas.<br />
<br />
I don't purport to be a PvP Master, but I'd like to think I can hold my own.<br />
<br />
The only class I have lots of problems with is Shamans during the off-chance I get challenged by them, but since I am Horde, I don't have to worry about that much in PvP.<br />
<br />
Your main strategy is to outlast your opponent, not to out-damage them. The main strategy I use is to use my healing powers every chance I get while conserving my mana.<br />
<br />
I am Restoration specced so I don't do much damage, but it takes even good damage dealers forever to kill me.<br />
<br />
You'll have to learn the nuances and skills of each class to counterract them, but Bear Form + Frenzied Regeneration is one of my favorites to use. On melee classes, use Nature's Grasp, which allows you to get some range and heal or cast if needed.<br />
<br />
Hunters - Hope they aren't smart enough to use Aspect of the Wild, sleep the pet, root the Hunter, stand in their Dead Zone and cast away. You can go Bear Form and when they start to cast Scare Beast, pop out of Bear immediately. Duel a Hunter friend, go to Bear form and let them cast it on you so you know what it looks like.<br />
<br />
Mages - Swiftshifting helps, but isn't required. Mages should not be a problem until post-50 when Mages really start to kick ass. Keep shifting out of their Sheeps/Frost Nova. Fire-specced Mages are tougher than Frost-Specced Mages.<br />
<br />
Rogues - Tough. If they get the jump, spam NG until you are out of stun, NS + HT if needed, go to Travel Form, and run away. If you're Tauren, Warstomp is your friend. Then come back stealthed and attack the Rogue on your terms if you want to kill them. Fairie Fire is your friend here. I'm sure it's possible to kill a Rogue even if they get the jump, but I've never stuck around to find out.<br />
<br />
Don't forget about potions. This is one thing I tend to forget about because the Druid is the first Healing class I've rolled, so I always want to Heal myslef instead of using a Health Pot. I still have some learning to do myself. ;) If you are going to duel someone, you should state whether or not potions can be used. If you want the fight to be as PvP as possible, then you can allow it.<br />
<br />
There are multiple factors in PvP Success, in order of importance IMHO:<br />
<br />
1. Number of opponents.<br />
2. Who gets the jump.<br />
3. Level Differences.<br />
4. Skill. (Comes with practice)<br />
5. Gear. (Run Instances like mad and make lots of $$)<br />
6. Class. (Outlast not out-damage)<br />
7. Spec.<br />
8. Luck.</div></div><hr />

I have a couple questions:<br />
1. Does the Druid have any way to break Fear and to break whatever that spell is that immobilizes us with love (hearts flying around the head :) ?<br />
<br />
2. When dueling, I always get beat on the jump--if it's a rogue, they go stealth before I Fairie Fire them, warriors and pali's charge and stun me before I strike. The count down goes 3, 2, 1. Is it on 1 that action starts, or on the tick after one? i.e. 3,2,1,go or is it 3,2,go.<br />
<br />
3. Anger said to spam NG till out of a rogues stun. If natures grasp grabs them, they can still melee, so it is useless unless it still has them while we are free to run. Or am I misunderstanding what NG does?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. I am not sure on this one. I think there are some that we were supposed to be able to break as of the last patch, Frost Shock for example, but still weren't. I know FOR SURE we can break Poly and Frost Nova. I have not run into too many Warlocks to find out about Charm and Fear. I know the last time I was Feared I coudn't break it through shifting.<br />
<br />
2. Not sure here either. I don't duel much, and if I do, I always spam my opening attack until it fires off. I never really paid attention to the countdown. You can't FF Rogues because they can stealth before the countdown begins. I can't mark them on my Hunter either. That's why duelling is lame and sometimes unrealistic to an extent in comparison to real PvP, not that duelling is completely useless.<br />
<br />
3. I must say that the only mistake I made in my initial post here is that I am not sure how effective my strategy will be if you do not have Warstomp (i.e. you are an Alliance Druid):<br />
<br />
You have to spam it until you're out of the stun. You'll spam it and keep getting the &quot;You can't do that while stunned.&quot; message until the stun breaks. If you have improved NG, there is no reason why they won't be rooted once you trigger it unless they have insane Nature Resistance. On an equal-levelled Rogue, you should have enough armor/hp to withstand the intial onslaught even though they can still get in 1-2 more hits after being rooted. Remember, if you survive it and have NS + HT available, use it while you run away just before you go to travel form.<br />
<br />
If they're smart, they'll hit vanish and sprint to catch up, but you'll once again be at full health. They'll try to stunlock you once again, but you will outlast that and still be able to run. Run to the nearest ocean if there is one accessible and go to seal form. Nothing they can do after that. The only way they can kill you is if they out-level you.<br />
<br />
I have only had one Rogue out of the countless ones who have tried to gank me be successful, and it was because he was +2 levels, I was at 1/2 health, and I'd already burned my Warstomp + NG.<br />
<br />
On a side note, there was a &quot;Nerf Warstomp for Tauren Druids&quot; thread on the WoW Rogue Forums (and additionally on the Druid Forums) because Rogues felt that Tauren Druids were ungankable (and therefore overpowered, of course, by their reasoning) because of it. I'd link it but we all know how unreliable the WoW Forum search tool is.<br />
<br />
Silly Rogues.<br />
<br />
I think the only additional advice I can give you at this point, is to organize your icons for easier clicking. I use Insomniax, which has 7 floatable toolbars, and I organize them so they're all together in appropriate places. All my heals are under the group avatars, all my anti-gank tools are in the same place, and I have a lot of them in redundant places depending on the situation.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the only time I spam moonfire is if my opponent is down to 1/5-1/8 health. It's really for beating them down that last bit of HP. If you spam it throughout the fight, you'll run oom toot-sweet.<br />
Keep yourself healed and eat away at their HP. Don't forget about Bear Form and Frenzied Regeneration, and Potions. Also, don't forget about Rejuvenation and Regrowth: they stack, so it might keep your healing up with their DPS.<br />
<br />
Patience is the key.</div></div><hr />

Use natures grasp, and once you tangle them, go cat form and hit speed boost (sprint).  When speed boost is up, then shift to cheetah.  Don't go cheetah from the start.<br />
<br />
The reason is that the rogue's sprint is +50% while cheetah is only +40%.  I have had a rogue catch up to me quickly after vanishing from roots and finish me off.  But our cat form sprint is +50% so you will be able to stay ahead of them until their sprint runs out and then you have your cheetah speed vs their normal running speed.  Also this leaves the option of stealthing right away when sprint wears off.<br />
<br />
So normally I do this:<br />
<br />
[stealthed rogue stuns you]<br />
Keep hitting natures grasp until it works (unstunned)<br />
As I am running away, hit natures swiftness and HT for full instant heal<br />
Cat form and sprint<br />
<br />
That normally saves me vs any rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">08-12-2005, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">rogues are particularly nasty at your level, as you get higher they won't be quite as deadly(still deadly, but much more managable)<br />
One of the best things you can do for yourself is to take the time to learn the other classes. The reason you probably do well against warriors is because you have played one yourself. You know just what a warrior doesn't want you to do, and just exactly what to expect from them so youc an guard against it. People on my server always complain about shamans(I play alliance) and I really believe it's because they only have a vague idea of what shaman can do. I took a rogue to 50 before I went back to druid so I always had an especially easy time with rogues(especially as I reached 50). I found myself able to take on rogues 3-4 levels higher than me just because I knew what to expect and what to do to make their lives difficult. <br />
Also find a friend who will sit with you and duel over and over again. It will help you get better at duels and help your overall pvp. I did a lot of practicing with a mage friend as I was leveling and he told me later that druids seemed so easy now incomparison. We spent enough time dueling that he got a feel for what to expect a druid to do and just exactly what to look for and how to counter it when he sees it.<br />
Sorry if I repeated anything, I didn't read all the way through everyone's responses, I hope my 2cp helps :D</div></div><hr />

just to clarify, your cat's dash is the same speed atthe same rank of a rogue's sprint. It starts at 50% however rogues get rank 2(60%) around level 30 while catform dash rank 2 isn't unill your late 40's(possibly early 50's, I don't remember exactly) but untill you get rank 2 dash, a rogue's sprint will outrun you. and midlevel, a rogues sprint will easily catch your travel form :/ just listen for the sprint sound, it's unmistakable and sounds just like the sound when you activate dash. I usually like to save my catform dash for when they use sprint, but what lawdawg just said works pretty well too :D</div></div><hr />

I dont even play WoW, (I play a little so I know the basics) and I know that this statement couldnt be farther from the truth. If the Rogue didnt have sprint, how is he supposed to catch runners that manage to get outta stunlock and put some space between them and the rogue? How would the rogue escape from higher lvls that ambush them? The roots indoors makes sense, but the travel form thing really dosent add up, sure you can't make roots out of a stone floor, but you cant turn into a cheetah in a dungeon? roflmywaffleskates? Also, A rogue is only deadly in certain circumstances, if he gets the jump on you and manages to belt out that major damage hes able to do in that situation, then obviously the fight is in his/her favor. However, through experience as a rogue in other games, they cannot tank worth.... a copper. They realy have low dmg output when they are the suprised ones, and you are tanking them, due to your high HP and his/her low, (PLD, WAR?) So, people say that rogue need a nerfing? No! The other classes need to smarten up, tighten their belts, and learn from the vast number of times you've experienced pure unadulterated pwnage at the hands of a rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">08-15-2005, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even when suprised Rogues still have the cards in their favor.  A preperation rogue especially can vanish twice in the fight if they want for 2 ambushes.  Even a tank can't really substain th e Damage if the rogue gets 5pt Expose Armor on them.  And trust me, those 5pts are easily aquired in a matter of 2-3 sinister strikes. On top of that they can simply Blind, and full heal, or as of late they particulalrly like to Vanish, find a place to hide, and heal, thus giving them the option to Blind you later on if they haven't wont yet.  And don't forget there is still Evasion to be used by them as well.  Ontop of all that, they all fight the same way, circle strafing while spamming the backstab attack.<br />

The way I beat rogues is once the rogue comes out of hiding like they always do, walk back wards stun them with ur 5 sec stun come out of bear form cast root/rejuv/moonfire farie fire bark skin and back into bear form. After u get some damage come out of bear form cast natures swiftness-heal full life/ rejuv natures grasp / moonifre farie fire him once again. How can a rogue bandage if he's in the effect of moonfire? he can't. Always remember to walk backwards, they don't do so well if u face them all the time and I found out our heals and def of bark skin plus bear form tanks every bit of their damage. I slaughter 60 rogues only ones that stand a chance against me are the ones with full poison effects. Even they have it hard when their rooted and nuked from a distance.<br />

Hi lvl 39 druid with questions on pvp. I play on a pvp server but always lvl with a rogue friend of mine so i've haven't had problems with gankers yet. But i'm finding it hard to win in duels against anything but warriors. I'm a ex warrior so i'm finding this change over to druid a challenge. I'm not sure if it's me not understanding the druid full ability or just the warrior in me taking over in pvp and getting my butt kicked.

Well, gee, I guess they'd be in the same position as, say, everyone else that doesn't have a travel form or buff - which is to say 70% of the WoW classes. <br />
<br />
Class balance should be an easy thing to spot in WoW.  <br />
<br />
1.  Go to WoW Census<br />
2.  Check PVP realm class percentages<br />
3.  See that Rogues and Shaman make up about 40% of all characters on PVP realms<br />
4.  Think about why #3 exists...</div></div><hr />

The key is getting Faerie Fire off and keeping them dotted with Moonfire. If you have both of these spells on them they are cake.<br />
<br />
I literally just drop those spells on them and go into bear form and let them kill themselves on my thorns, if they stun and try to run I just use Feral Charge to catch them again and do the same thing over. Rogues will give you a lot of Rage very quickly so you'll find a 2000hp heal on the cards quickly from Feral Regeneration. They have to kill you 1.5 times with like 8k armor, and that's even before any mana based heals or potions, its very difficult.<br />
<br />
Swiftshifting helps a lot as I drop into caster form to keep Moonfire and Faerie fire on them constantly then back into bear. Harry them, never let them stealth. Carry potions - health, mana, remove poison and swiftness potions. Nets are good too so you don't have to stop to cast root. There are lots of ways to kill them if you're serious about PVP. :)<br />
<br />
The most important thing? Don't panic, be patient. If you find yourself losing the battle from some lucky crits, root them and heal up, then go at it again. For god's sake, don't spam Moonfire or you're going to die - Moonfire spamming Druids should be flogged and exiled. Moonfire is there to keep them taking damage so they can't stealth, not for killing them with the initial nuke amount.</div></div><hr />

I have had some success stealthing myself and getting the initiative, but usually, the rogues gets it (after all.. they are rogues). :)<br />
Remember.. they hit hard, but they can't really take a beating for long.<br />
<br />
Hunter: Another easy fight. Shadowmeld/Hibernate pet. Or hibernate at least. Don't let the hunter kite you (they can do insane damage at a distance with proper build).. feral charge or dash into melee as fast as possible. Don't run straight at the hunter as he/she prolly has set up a trap. Dispel Viper sting fast as hell if he/she uses it(!). Hunters are easy onces you get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
Pally/Druid: ZzZz.. Prepare for 20 mins of healing/tanking. Pally heals can be interuppted by feral charge.. use that if you have it. Otherwise i have no real advice. Comfort yourself by the fact that a pally can't kill you in PvP unless you want to give him the chance. ;)<br />
<br />
Mage: Theese guys get REALLY nasty with highend gear.. You need to keep yourself healed as a MF if possible as some mages can poof your health to 20% in a sec. Don't bother with forms as armor is bla-bla vs magic. Just the bash or charge when needed.<br />
Trick: &quot;Faking&quot; a heal with the heartstone (it's the same graphic as regrowth etc) is cool. But most good mages won't get fooled by that.<br />
<br />
Warlock: My companion plays a warlock (damage build) so I have dueled this class very much. It's like a &quot;priest-light&quot; at best times. If he/she plays with imp, you can easily outlast him/her with your manaregen/heals and overall druidness. :) Remember if the imp starts fireballing in the beginning.. just target it and kill it (it has like 1k hp). A lock without his imp is extremely easy.<br />
If he/she plays succubus it's pretty much the same.. rooting succ and going for the lock is an option. Seduction/big fat nuke isnt really a problem.. He cant counter or dispel your heals.. if you survive.. spam the heals and melee/moonfire him/her. Don't bother with forms.<br />
If she/he plays with the felhunter things are looking nasty. The felhunter can't be rooted (or sure.. it CAN), it can dispel your heals (use healing touch if possible) and it can dispel innervate! :(<br />
Second hardest class to duel (with felhunter) for a resto/feral druid imo.<br />
<br />
Priest: Good luck. You're gonna need it. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW does anyone ever use pounce as their opener rather than ravage ?? u only really get that first chance to use ravage and do some major damage, which means that for me, pounce is rarely used, which is a shame cos it could be pretty handy in-fight....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Priests: In battles, not duels, just drive the priest insane until help shows up. <br />
<br />
Warriors: Snooze much?<br />
<br />
Rogues: A very good rogue usually makes me a very dead druid. However, against the average rogue, 10k armor and a little timing and the skills mentioned above usually wins the day.<br />
<br />
Paladins: These are funny fights. Bear tank them. They barely do damage but will have to heal themselves as you damage them. If they're using a 2-hander, you should be able to inflict enough damage to force them to heal/use up their mana. if they're using a 1-hander + shield, just ignore them. they're no threat to anyone or anything.<br />
<br />
Shamans: I love dueling these guys. It's all about timing your stuns. I have no idea how an Alliance druid pvp's a shammy. As a tauren, i need my warstomp or i lose. The fights are usually very long.<br />
<br />
Mages: &quot;hey, look, i'm in bear and you hit me for a Fireball? darn... *shift, heal, moonfire* Oh, look, you slowed me down, *shift*, oh, you froze me to this spot, *shift, moonfire* oh, you're out of mana... Darn...*smack smack* look, you're dead. darn...<br />
<br />
Hunters: I usually ignore their pets and go straight for them. Hunter pets do physical damage and we have a ton of health and armor. Ignore the pets and hit the hunters. Usually, at least these days, the hunters themselves are squishier than the pets.</div></div><hr />

It's not a good idea really dude. Most good hunters have cat pets. And they have a 1.0 hit speed.. which interuppts your spells. :/</div></div><hr />

Or NS/Hibernate the pet. Beral/Charge the hunter.<br />

He didnt know what hit him and he's prolly gonna spam the forums with &quot;NERF DRUIDS!&quot;.<br />

You dont have to kill them fast really. Just stay close and they panic. If they melee you they have crapier dps (compared to your armor) than you have in bear, really. And all good hunters know this and will try to get distance again and again. Overall druidness can deal with that.<br />

Ya I hear you. You have to trick them (but then again.. you have in all fights.. excepts pallys:p)<br />
<br />
Not trying to teach you how to play vs hunters dude. ;) I myself have no problem with them whatsoever anymore. The main thing is just to not let em kite you imo. :)<br />

Haha, I knew instantly u're alliance when I saw that last statement about attacking while he's fighting a mob. Cowardish as usual, and the ones that get's instantly on my KoS list.<br />
<br />
Anyway, for Hunters that's the one time I almost find it useful to spam Moonfire - which doesn't really get interrupted by the cat pet. Root'em, go in between their melee and range distance and spam'em to death with Moonfire / whatever. Easy piecy. I can't remember getting killed by a Hunter ever, but true I have not fought THAT much and may simply not have met a specially good one yet. Oh yeah and I sleep the pet if I bother but don't really find it required. Guess it depends on your talents, whether u get interrupted when u heal or not.</div></div><hr />

if you wish to pretend that the honorable horde are engaged in a war against the dishonorable alliance, go right ahead (and we'll also pretend horde don't jump me as i fight mobs).  this need to pigeon hole each faction into good or evil says more about your experience in the game than it does about my behavior.<br />
