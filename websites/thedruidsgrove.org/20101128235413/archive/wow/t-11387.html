<br />
Does improved leader of the pack work?<br />
I had my group watch the last 2-nights and we never see any icon or anything come up for the 6% healing to the group when I critical hit?<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen anything to tell you about the healing part for that buff?<br />
We have the icon that said 5% crit. but we never see anything on the healing!<br />

I'll get yellow text in my combat window saying &quot;Improved Leader of the Pack has healed you for XXX&quot; shortly after a crit. It can only go off once every 6 seconds, so you may not see it after every crit.</div></div><hr />

Your group doesn't get the heal, whoever gets the crit gets the heal. And you won't get an icon/buff, it hits you just like a direct heal. I did BWL last night in a group of 3 rogues and 1 DPS warrior and they loved it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windsaber</div><div class="date">12-14-2006, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so your saying when people in my group get a crit, they get the heal?<br />
And we should see it in the combat text of the chat window?<br />
<br />
I don't understand sorry!<br />
Please explain how this healing works?<br />
My guild would like to know so they can setup the raids to use this!<br />
Oh and I made MT for my guild !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone<br />

&quot;... heal themselves for (2/4/6)% of their total health when they critically hit with a melee or ranged attack.&quot;<br />
<br />
And yes, it should show in your combat window, I get it in yellow text, I'm also seeing my heal pop in scrolling combat text.</div></div><hr />

They loved ImpLOTP!  Have your party enable scrolling text to see when you get healed.  If another party member gets a crit it will show that you healed them.  <br />
<br />
Oh and btw, my feral Damage has gone up ALOT!  Mangle rocks!  I was critting with Mangle for 800+.  Not really sure if that is a huge deal, but it sure is better than I am used to.</div></div><hr />

It sounds so sweet I will watch it tonight!<br />

Ya the bear can acctually dish out some pain now. I did Scholo too the other night as tank (5-man group) and I had 26% damage done afterwards.<br />
<br />
And I was teamed with Naxx-geared people.. That's pretty hefty for ANY tank tbh. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">01-12-2007, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not take ImpLotP but I am now considering it. Do you all think this is a talent well worth having? Right now I have 3 points in the Fear/Stun resist talent and although it has worked im not seeing a big payoff for the 3 point investment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">01-12-2007, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imp LotP was dropped from a 6% to a 4% of the players max life.  It was too much for a passive ability before.  It's still quite nice though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">01-12-2007, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imp. LotP is a pretty moderate talent.  It's going to provide a stream of low level life gain that will kind of grease the wheels while soloing, saving you a little time here and there.  In raids, if you get grouped with a bunch of melees (as you should) it will provide them with that sort of low-level life gain that will help cut down on the healing they need vs. bosses that do AE damage.<br />
<br />
Until you're nearing 70 and 10k+ hp (if ever), I don't see being overwhelmed with Imp. LotP.  That said, it's going to at least give you SOME tangible benefit a lot more than Primal Tenacity.  I'm taking Imp. LotP right off, I don't know if I'm going to get PT at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">01-12-2007, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having had ILotP (the 6% version) since 2.0.1, I consider it a very nice talent. A bit too powerful imo, so I understand the nerf to 4%. It's a talent I'll be getting in any full feral build I'll spec, I think. When I had the 6% version,  it kept my hp topped off when I grinded in cat form. When I tanked (in 40 mans -- I'm a raid tank) the battle reports showed that I healed myself (i.e. not counting the heals for the rest of the group) for 5-15% of all the damage I took when tanking (what percentage varied with the encounter). That was with 6% ILotP, but I still consider it well worth the talent points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">01-21-2007, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im lvl 63 atm, and got buffed up and over 10k HP(PoF, Food + lock pet) - convinced it will do the trick healing if one tank at 70.<br />
<br />
Sadly, funny and ironicly, yesterday I tanked in Slave Pens, and at the big shellfish boss(dont remember the name) the preist and pala couldnt heal me fully to remove the debuff(loosing 500-800 Hp /2 secs, I think), after several tries and wipes we put a rogue tanking with alot of dodge and low HP, and me healing - and we downed him lol<br />
<br />
Didnt have any joy of it then but on the next/last boss I got some nice returns on the ILotP.</div></div><hr />
