Do you gain Experience quicker these days in the lower levels, sort of what WoW does for players 1 thru 60?<br />
I used my level 18 Necro and went from level 18 to level 22 in a short period of time. I believe I was in at least one hot zone, but I don't think they were all hot zones.<br />
Does EQ give experience quicker at lower levels these days?</div></div><hr />

Unless your in a hotzone the xp you gain is the same.  And by that I mean, they haven't adjusted the ZEM for any of the lower zones except when they turn it into a hotzone.  What your seeing is your gear &gt; than mobs you're killing.  The faster you kill the faster you level.  So thats what your &quot;saw&quot; when you where leveling.  Just the speed to kill 'em has increased considerably causing you to level faster.  You can honestly level faster than your skills will raise.  Usually I can get to 65 non-pl'd and then stop to work my weapon skills because I leveled that fast cause of gear.</div></div><hr />

Hail him for a list of the current hot zones, and a task in the hot zone of your choice.<br />
