Just got back in the game a couple of weeks ago.  I can really use your feedback on gear upgrades.  I'm somewhat limited in funds and I tend to solo quite a bit.  Here is my magelo:<br />

However, you can buy DON crystals to puchase no drop gear and augs from the DoN merchants, and once you no longer need the near or aug you can sell it back to the merchant for 70%? of what you paid for it.<br />
 <br />
There's some nice common attunable drops that you can buy for cheap, but the rarer stuff really isn't worth the price imo.  I'ld recommend focusing on getting DoN gear.<br />

Nowadays there's a lot of armor you can farm from one group content that's actually very good, once you get up in level you can check that out.</div></div><hr />
