Items in my inventory very often are &quot;blacked out&quot; or an item takes on a different look. Such as my apples looking like soulstones. And some spell icons look different than thy should.<br />
This ALL gets corrected when I type /console reloadui<br />
But I have to type that constantly.<br />
Did this ever happen to any of you?<br />
How can i fix this? What is this?</div></div><hr />

It seems the icon cache gets corrupted and needs to be refreshed.  You can blow out your WDB, but I usually have to do a reloadui at least once a login too.  It has just become something I expect to have to do now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it makes the game interesting because sometimes battle shout will have the SW:Pain icon...and I'd be freaking out...even though it is weird that some debuff icons get mixed over into buff icons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">04-17-2007, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone mentioned it could be because I need to update my video drivers. Besides the fact i have no idea even what video driver my dell uses and how to even go about updating it..............i thought WoW was supposed to be much easier on the video issues, compared to games like EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would do as Big9erfan suggested and try deleting your WDB folder first.  Easy to try.<br />
<br />
For finding your video card, try this:<br />
<br />
Start, Run, type &quot;dxdiag&quot;.  Click on the Display tab on top.  It will show the video card you have on the left and your driver version on the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am bad with computers....where do I find the WDB file and is it called WDB exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With 2.0 the WDB folder moved, it is now in ( for example )<br />
C:\Program Files\World Of Warcraft\Cache\<br />
<br />
Just delete the entire WDB folder and see if that works for you.<br />
<br />
Another way to find your video card:<br />
- Right click on any empty space on your desktop<br />
- Choose &quot;Properties&quot;<br />
- Go the &quot;Settings&quot; tab<br />
Under &quot;Display:&quot; it should list your video card.  If you are having problems figuring out what type you have just post what is displayed there and we can help you further.</div></div><hr />

It also says its NVDIA integrated. How can i go about updating my video drivers. A few months ago the computer kept flashing that i should update the video driver, but I ignored it. I would like to now.<br />
Any idea how i can?<br />
thanks for the assist :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NVidia makes good cards ( I prefer them usually over ATI, but that's just my personal choice ).<br />
<br />
http://www.nvidia.com will have your drivers.<br />
<br />
Click the link in the top left ( Download Drivers )<br />
Select &quot;Graphics Drivers&quot;<br />
Then in the middle box &quot;GeForce 6 series&quot;<br />
Then in the right box choose your OS ( I am going to assume XP ).<br />
<br />
You should be able to download and install with no problem.  Hopefully that will help as well.</div></div><hr />
