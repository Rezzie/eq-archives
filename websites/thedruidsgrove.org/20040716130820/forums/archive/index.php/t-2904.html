<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GalaaDarksong</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is correct?<br />
<br />
1) right now, all magic based DoTs will stack with each other. And it doesnt matter which is casted first(meaning doesnt hv to cast lower lvl 1st, can cast in any sequence)<br />
<br />
2)Fire based DoTs will stack with magic dots, but will not stack with itself. So I can only cast ONE fire based DoT on a target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it goes like this.<br />
<br />
All DoTs of the same name stack if cast by different players.  In the case of stacking DoTs of different levels the lower must be cast first than the higher one.  If the higher is cast first the lower one will get a &quot;didn't take hold&quot; message.  Eg in the case of Drifting Death and Drones of Doom, Drones of Doom would need to be cast first, then Drifting Death (this is of course being cast by 2 different people, if cast by the one Drifting Death just overwrites Drones of Doom completely)<br />
<br />
This works for all DoT whether they be Magic, Disease, Poison or Fire Based.  Not sure if there is a cold based one out there.<br />
<br />
This was all my understanding of the explanation given, although I don't know anyone low enough to test this with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never use drifting death, but I can say that I cast WD, then bracer drones, and I have never had a message that drones wouldn't take hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats becuase the Drones of Doom/Drifting Death line of spells stacks with Winged Death.<br />
<br />
Possible DoTs one druid can stack on a mob<br />
<br />
Winged Death/Swarming Death<br />
Drones of Doom/Drifting Death<br />
Breath of Ro/Fury of Ro<br />
Immolation<br />
Nature Walkers Scimitar (epic)<br />
I believe even Flame Lick can be added to the end of this list but hardly worth casting.<br />
<br />
The spell after the slash is the higher level version of the stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe just reread the original post and see the question isn't really relating to multi-stacking a DoT, but how they can actually stack.<br />
<br />
There has been no changes that I recall happening to how they stack except in regards to multiple casters of DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this [/link=pub149.ezboard.com/fthedr...3012.topic (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showMessage?topicID=3012.topic)]reference[/link]<br />

I can cast Immolate, Breath of Ro, Drones of Doom, Drifting Death and Winged Death,  aparently in any order and they all stack.<br />
<br />
Now shhhhh before the nerf bat hears you.</div></div><hr />
