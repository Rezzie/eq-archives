<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is happening on FV server. It's very frustrating. I killed to tainted, and nothing popped. Nothing on track. There was one &quot;Aqua Goblin Shaman&quot; on track, but it was not anywhere reachable. Track might have been messed up. Are these broken everywhere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kerech</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This has always been that way.  The corrupted does not always spawn after the tainted goblin is killed :( <br />
<br />
Some of the other tainted/corrupted are like that as well, like the gorilla in EJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep I killed 4 tainteds before I got my corrupted when I did my epic.<br />
<br />
just be patient....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Matafleur Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep, patience is the key. It's frustrating but there isn't much you can do about it.<br />
<br />
Good luck in getting that Corrupted!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks. =)  Based on how the other tainted worked, I expected an immediate pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Based on how the other tainted worked, I expected an immediate pop. [/quote]<br />
<br />
Other Tainted?  there are a few who actually work like the goblin, sometimes there is a way of telling whether it will actually spawn the tainted before killing it.<br />
<br />
The ones I can remember.<br />
The Fish in Lake of Ill Omen.  Pull it to the shore and walk onto land.  If it follows you onto land it WILL spawn the tainted, remaining in the water means it is a dud.<br />
The Gorilla in EJ, if it is an undead looking gorilla (eg pieces of skin missing etc) it will spawn the tainted, else your out of luck.<br />
<br />
I know the gorilla took me about 8 corrupted to get, the goblin took 2 and the fish took 4.<br />
<br />
Wish you lots of luck, but seeing the corrupted shouldn't get your hopes up too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>aandaie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Goblin took me forever.<br />
Was horrible.<br />
<br />
It is totally random, so you could be there for 20 minutes or 15 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only 'good' thing about the goblin is that you'll always have company in Clerics looking for Lord Bergurgle. :) <br />
<br />
I camped that guy on at least 3 full evenings, getting nothing but the ocassional Tainted. On a 4th evening some friends were there camping Lord B and I asked to come down and help if no one needed the Tainted's.<br />
<br />
I no sooner hit return on my 'I've been here many nights and this guy just won't spawn' when he spawned. And just after I looted, HE SPAWNED AGAIN. Go figure!<br />
<br />
Fast forward a few months and my guild cleric is now camping Lord B. I am there with my rogue tanking for her. She had been camping Lord B for a few nights. Lord B spawned, she gets the crown and heads to do turn in. By the time I get back to PoK, Lord B spawned back to back. So now my level 35 Cleric has a started his epic.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that spawn is so erratic you can go minutes or days.. I have one druid friend that took 3 months to get that spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard that if you pull the tainted gobbie up to shore, it will spawn the corrupt.  I killed prolly like 15 tainted in the water and never spawned one, so finally decided to pull it up on land above.  Maybe dumb luck but it spawned that 1 time I pulled it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pulling it up on shore does not always spawn a Corrupted.<br />
<br />
Just get lucky.<br />
<br />
Killed about 8 hours at this camp to get my corrupted to spawn.. when he did another tainted spawned, and a second corrupted right after that.<br />
<br />
Overall I think it is just a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It sounds like you might be getting things confused with LOIO--if I remember right, only the kind of tainted barracuda that will follow you onto land will spawn a corrupted.  The tainted ones that won't spawn a corrupted won't follow you out of the water.  Actually pulling the barracuda out of the water doesn't change whether it'll spawn a corrupted, just indicates whether it will.<br />
<br />
I have no idea if that applies to the aqua goblins.  It's possible they work the some way...I had no idea it was possible for a tainted aqua goblin not to spawn a corrupted.  I guess I was just lucky getting a corrupted from my first tainted (though it did take quite some time for that tainted to pop).</div></div><hr />
