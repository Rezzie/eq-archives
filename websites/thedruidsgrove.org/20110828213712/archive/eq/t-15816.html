<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenton</div><div class="date">04-30-2007, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got this great email from friends in game from pre-kunark.  &quot;Hey, were trying to put together an old world 1 night a week group.  Interested?&quot;<br />
<br />
I thought long and hard, after several seconds, ok, only 1 or 2, I jumped at the idea.<br />
<br />
So getting back into the game is an interesting thing to do here.<br />
<br />
I had at one time, a 55ish druid, back when that meant something, but due to some &quot;issues&quot; he got deleted and now I'm playing with a 30 druid I re rolled a few years back.<br />
<br />
Couple of quicky questions.  Have they made any adjustments to what it takes to get an Epic 1.0?  Even when playing full time, there just was no way my schedule allowed me to spend the time to get this.  Is there higher end gear that obviates the need for the Epic 1.0?  How about 1.5 and 2.0?  <br />
<br />
Any truly cool new things out there?  Last time I played was just after LDoN went live.  I cruised by the camp in Butcher and it was empty of all players.  LDon go out of fashion?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts for a returning low level druid?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

The rewards are out of line. DoN's are similar, but the earned &quot;points&quot; - now crystals - are tradeable and the gear is substantially better.<br />
 <br />
Lots has changed since LDoN. I pretty much soloed my epic 1.0, you can probably do the same once you gear up a bit but most likely not worth the effort. You do NOT need 1.0 to start 1.5 (instead there is a pre-quest you can do).<br />
 <br />
Good luck, look around at lots of changes, have fun.<br />

 <br />
   One thing for sure though is that SOE came out with an anniversay issue that would allow you to access TSS I think, which I've heard is very lowbie friendly.<br />
 <br />
   I am currently unable to play so; I have been trolling alot around these boards, and found out about the new out of combat regen status that was implemented, which I think would speed up lvling and from what I have gathered, its also easier to lvl in the new expansions; so you should'nt have any problems catching up at all especially if your coming back with friends.<br />
 <br />
  Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

I bought the Titainum Edition for $19.  Haven't found the Anniversery addition yet.  Will probably pick it up.  The expansion rewards are worth the money alone.</div></div><hr />
