Im feral specced and dont care about being laughed at and having my end game suck....if i wanted to heal i would have been a priest exclusively...i know, ha ha funny.......i heal for groups a bit..but my guildies usually let me go kitty or bear..thxns for input......at level 57 with no high end gear---i did hit 1387 already once!!!!! thats promising...One other question too...how do i build my combo points? I usually throw faerie fire then the 2 damage over time ones...then hit them with claw..then finally ferocious bite..is there a better way?<br />

Oh, and for your 1300 hit, I scored a 1200 with catform's DD finisher with only double-digit AGI.</div></div><hr />

I agree.  But there is definitely a place for both (too bad we can't always have our cake and eat it too :)).  Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but the amount you crit for is dependant on your strength?  Agil will help you crit more often, but you should crit for more on average if you have more strength?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remina</div><div class="date">07-26-2005, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Strength, without a doubt.  Many people think agility is a good stat to get for cat form, since cat form mimics rogues and rogues rely on agility.  However, the mainr eason rogues use agility is because their class is coded differently than others--they gain attack power from both strength AND agility.  Upping agility on a rogue will increase both the damage of their hits and the frequency of critical hits.  It's pretty much a no brainer for rogues that agi &gt; str.<br />
<br />
However, for druids, the only way to get higher damage is to increase your strength.  Bumping agility will only increase you crit chance by a fairly small amount.  If you're going for the big &quot;bragging numbers&quot;, strength is still the best bet since you'll be critting off of higher base damages (a critical hit, fyi, is just a normal hit x2.  Higher base hits = higher critical hits).<br />
<br />
What I do for feral form is rely on strength/stamina gear in combination with +% crit and +attack power gear.  This way you can get the best of both worlds without (unsuccessfully) pretending to be a rogue :)</div></div><hr />

For one, as people said, agility exclusively adds to our crit rate, whereas strength (as well as attack power) gives us a boost in overall damage. You also have to realize that it takes a fair amount of agility to up your crit rate by any significant amount, and I've heard that it has diminishing returns on its effect on your crit rate as well. So yeah, strength. Agility is good as an ADDITION, but I've always focused on strength. The best way to get a nice crit rate is just to get some nice crit geat (Devilsaur stuff, which I prefer to Warbear, Eye of Rend, Mark of Fordring, etc).</div></div><hr />

I guess I'll try the STR route myself soon. I've always focused on AGI because I wanted to be more of a rogue in feral forms, but the way the game plays out at level 60, bear form just seems much more useful.<br />
<br />
I think I'll wait until the next patch, though. They're supposed to be addressing druids with that one and who knows. . . maybe they'll make cat form more viable and agility will become more important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll put this in bold so nobody can miss it: Rogues gain attack power from agility, but druids do NOT! That's why +agi is such a huge bonus to rogues.  They get the normal benefits of it, plus a big boost to their damage.</div></div><hr />

The guys that like to do math seem to conclude that Str&gt;Agil till your over 1000 Attack Power.... which is a decent feat.<br />
<br />
Math chrunchers aside, I think Str &gt; Agil for some far simpler reasons.  To begin with how many suits of gear do we need?  Str is best for AP in bear and cat, so edge to str in that regard.  Beyond that, you'll be stepping on less rogue toes by going Str.  Rogues aren't as intrested in str items as they are agil for good reason... Rogues are intrested in %crit or AP and they get more of both with agility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This assumes that AP is a more important TLA (two-letter acronym) for bear form.  Personnally, I see the primary role of bearform as soaking up damage.  Therefore, I want to max my HP (obviously through STA, which has no bearing on AP) and beef up my mitigation abilities, which means more AC and dodging.  Since AC is more or less constant across armor, you could choose armor heavy in STR, to boost attack (IMO, meaningless for bearform), or go for AGI, which may not yield as much a benefit for attack, but also provides defensive benefits.  Also, I don't have a ton of 18 slot bags, meaning I want to minimize the amount of extra armor I carry.<br />
<br />
So, IMHO, AGI &gt; STR<br />
<br />
To provide some context, I'm almost purely PVE.  If I go bearform, I'm playing defense.  I imagine if one PVP'ed more, a more offensive stance for bearform would be appropriate.  Hence, the attack boost from STR would help, and the basic 360% AC boost of dire bear would be sufficient.  YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">10-07-2005, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">increased attack power from strength allows you to do more damage and thus maintain aggro better.  while agility does help you with dodging, the bonus it gives to your armor rating is not included in the 360% ac boost, making it mean very little for damage mitigation.  i am not sure per point of agility what increased percentage chance we have to dodge, but i would think as a tank we would all be better served by acquiring +defense items if possible despite the fact that we can't parry or block.  in reality, bear form is only intended to soak up damage, not dodge as warriors can, so agility be comes pretty useless in that sense.<br />
<br />
the only reason i can see why agi &gt; str in bear form would be if you have the crit talent in the feral tree (primal fury?) that allows you to gain rage whenever you crit on a regular attack or a special one like maul or swipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i first went feral i was very heavy into agil. Up around 200. Yep i critted alot but my dps really was all over the board. I decided i needed a better average so i started looking for str gear.<br />
<br />
Right now i am at 163str 148agil - About 3600hp and 3300mana with a 2500ish ac in my cat form dps setup.<br />
<br />
In this build configure i am good for about 150 to 200 dps with burst of near 300. Also my dps is not just dependent on a good operner like it was in my agil setup. When i am farming token in wp i dont even bother to ravage. I just run up and go to town.<br />
<br />
I have concluded that u need agil for that good bust dps and str to have  to give u a better over all average.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only real problem i have right now is it takes 3 bags to hold just my gear. Healing set  dps set bear set and a resist set for mc and onxy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">10-09-2005, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not all about attack power.  Strength doesn't do anything to the bonus damage of Maul, Swipe, Shred, Ravage etc.  While I agree that strength is the safer bet I just wanted to point out any ability that has a large bonus damage component to it probably ends up favoring agility over strength, especially cat form abilities.  Crits also obviously trigger other abilities in the game, not all of which are good for the druid.  I dislike critting warriors for example since it makes them enrage and ups their DPS a ton.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with others go strength first, but do it in moderation, don't drop a 15 agility item for a 10 strength item, at least thats my opinion.</div></div><hr />
