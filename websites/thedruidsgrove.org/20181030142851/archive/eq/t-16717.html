<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrian</div><div class="date">05-14-2008, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Icefall glacier is decent xp. Either the spiders, mammoth's, or bears. Charm kiting or root rotting both work well. If you have a decent mana pool then the goblin fort in Loping Plains is great xp especially if you do the faction tasks. Fight or Flight, Creepfeet Thievery, and Reducing the Threat - Goblins are the only three I'd bother with as the others require too much running around and that means no xp while travelling. Be advised these goblins have a good bit of hit points, so if you are light on mana and/or aa's then it isn't a good idea.<br />
 <br />
  Also you could kill gnolls in The Steppes, if you can slaughter them quickly. Either charming a nearby lizard or cat or root rotting work. They have less hp, but don't yield quite as much xp as the Icefall mobs do. Still should be a little safer and not so mana intensive as Icefall Glacier or Loping Plains.<br />
 <br />
  I am sure there are other camps that work equally well.</div></div><hr />

Deadbone reef in the buried sea is also nice for some solo action.</div></div><hr />

I love to solo because I don't like waiting for a group, but I am not uber at 7.7 K hp and 8 manaa  a 71 druid [my magelo not updated ]  I tried the mamoth and didnt have much luck, don't know if it because I have been gone so long or my crappy gear.  The knolls I have done but I just root-rot, charming used to be fun, but it has been a while.</div></div><hr />

Instead of having your pet do the killing you get 3 or so mobs and have them kill your pet. Just before you pet is dead you invis yourself to break charm then finish off the pet.</div></div><hr />

They have a nasty dot but a druid is perfect for them. Root them and stay out of range. The spell merchant is right there too for all your loot</div></div><hr />

Port to Direwind, turn and you will see a little valley with gnolls. They were great AA xp at an easy pace. If you have 2 friends/boxes to help you get the 69.1 mission, that's great solo xp for a couple of hours also.</div></div><hr />

Earned about 100 AAs just soloing the hand aug quest. Logged in for 5-10 kills every day before going to the office. Good for before/after raids as well.</div></div><hr />
