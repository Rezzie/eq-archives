<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lumbergh</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... when level 60's make alts and they want to run instances way above their level.  Example: I was running Stockade on my 29 alt, and the group leader invited a couple of lvl 20's.  Um... there's a reason why Blizz recommends 24+.  So as the lvl 20's are walking down the corridor, they're aggroing all the prisoners inside the cells.  Many wipes.<br />
<br />
I tried to talk some sense into the group leader, but he said they were alts of 60's so they would know what to do.  Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
At least with real noobs, most are willing to take your advice and stay back. :sumo: <br />
<br />
If you're a 60 and you have a low-level alt, why not ask one of your fellow 60's to run you through?  Leave the regular pugs alone. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

My big problem when I was leveling my druid was people who got higher level players to run us through. I don't mind if you are farming for something and it's your 156th time through, but the first time I run something I want to work for it. <br />
<br />
I was in my mid 30's and it was my first time at SM. Joined a group of 2 others about the same level, right after I joined one of them got 2 of their 60 guild mates to join. I should have left. Yea I got some great loot, and I went back many times with more balanced parties, but I missed my first time there.<br />
<br />
Ah well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">10-18-2006, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I came across a similar person in SM... who thought he knew everything. He was a hunter who claimed he had about 3 level 60s (I forgot what level he was, but he was lower than the rest of us)? Anyway, I forgot what we argued about, but he ticked me off and went off about the druid. So then I said, being the main healer, &quot;'kay, since you're such a god-like hunter and all, I'll let you heal yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
He ended up with about 5 on him, and then feign deathed to save his neck. The 5 attacking him went on me, and slaughtered me. And you know who gets blamed? Him, hah, and he was kicked out, because the rest hated him too. No one blamed me at all.<br />
<br />
Seriously, alts, whether they are or not, doesn't mean anything. I can imagine how annoyed you must have been, lumbergh.</div></div><hr />
