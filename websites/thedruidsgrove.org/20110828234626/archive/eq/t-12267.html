<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thanarina</div><div class="date">10-03-2005, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heyas,<br />
I'd call myself a very casual player these days now that I'm back at school, but I've recently been playing my druid again when I have a chance (my main is a 70sk with a mix of time and elem).  I threw a couple thousand on her in the bazaar and picked up a few DoN augs but mostly its stuff i've just picked up along the way.  <br />
<br />
In any case, I'm interested in getting her up to at least being decent and was wondering if you could give me any direction.  At the moment I have her in a super casual guild that's (don't laugh) just breaking into VT.  so really raid drops are pretty much out of the question.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer to be able to get the gear with her (1groupable, soloable, etc) but anything 1groupable or soloable (and tradeable) at 70 would work too.  I don't have any tradeskills to speak of, and only maybe 25k to spend.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking mainly at upping mana and mana regen (ft 0 :tut:), but if anything big is missing (essential clickies or focus or whatever) that would be great to know about aswell.<br />
<br />
In any case, any help would be great if anyone has the time to offer it, thanks so much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">10-03-2005, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend trying to level in WoS and pick up some of the tier 1 OoW armor drops while you're there.  Either that or pour some time into farming DoN crystals and grab some of that stuff.  Either way you go the upgrades would be significant and doable on a casual schedule.  Resist the urge to spend the crystals till you have enough for the top stuff offered at the vendors and win some rolls on the nodrop omens pieces and you should come out decently well off.  You would then be able to focus on filling other slots and getting some of the really cool clickies from VT rather than upgrading everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
neck - Watchman's Wrought-Iron Neckband or Cherry Blossom Necklace (kinda rare in zaar so might be more $$)<br />
range - blazing fire crystal<br />
head - scarred browband<br />
face - veil of the long ages or visor of protection<br />
<br />
<br />
little bit harder to upgrade as these will cost a little more in the bazaar:<br />
<br />
back - lots of options: Moss-Covered Cape, Feathered Cloak of the Lost, Hierophant's Cloak, Burning Chitin Cape (new from don)<br />
<br />
hands - feran gloves or Speckled Clay Handwraps (Riwwi) or Pristine Jeweled Gloves (hard, takish ldon drop)<br />
<br />
<br />
FT is a little harder because they tend to be a little expensive or rare drops.<br />
<br />
common ones are:<br />
veil of the windstrider - 1 groupable WoS drop. (face)<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Spiritseer - zonewide, rare drop from natimbi. (neck)<br />
<br />
ornate leather wrist pattern<br />
<br />
boots of flowing slime - Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
Spiritmaster War Beads - Chardok B (neck)<br />

The time spent v.s. gear updrades it worth it. You can get some very nice upgrades in that.<br />
<br />
Spend some time factioning for Loyalist ~ and look for the quest drops:<br />
<br />
Spire Control Shards / RCoD &gt; Hands &gt; Glistening Murkglider Pelts / RCoD (buyable)<br />
<br />
Dranik Blood Standard / WoS - RcoD &gt; Wrists &gt; Dansk Branch (buyable too...or hang out in NC)<br />
<br />
Duskfall Chronicles / WoS &gt; Helm &gt; <br />
<br />
Map of Old Kuua / WoS-RCoD  &gt; Arms &gt; Dansk Blossoms / Drops off NC trash (can be bought I think.) <br />
<br />
This is all from an old quest sheet I have, hopefully its all correct. BUT those few pieces from Omens have nice focus on them and are signifigant upgrades. The hardest part is the faction, getting the drops isn't too bad.<br />
<br />
Oh, yea.. and DoN some more for nice augs to put in them! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">10-05-2005, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll need elder spirit's armband for mana-free dot and ornate pant for mana-free root (this one will cost you a lot, maybe 60k?).<br />
 <br />
Have you bought level 61 ensnare spell from DON merchants?  <br />
 <br />
You can buy 2xFT3 and 2xFT2 augs from DON merchants. That's a total of FT10. Just do DON missions to get crystals -- that's 1groupable.<br />
 <br />
Ornate wristbands are FT2 and you can get 2 of them. These can be farmed (at Tower of Sol Ro? Not sure. 1groupable, key easy to get), or buy at bazaar.<br />
 <br />
There is a waistcoat with FT1 and focus effect boon of pious (better improved healing that works till level 70). This item is very good. Search for 'waistcoat' in the allakhazam database. I forget the whole name.</div></div><hr />

Not a gear upgrade recommendation but it should help.</div></div><hr />
