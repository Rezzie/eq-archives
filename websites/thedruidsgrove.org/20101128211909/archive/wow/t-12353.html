I hit 70 last week with my feral druid, and got attuned to Kara the same week-end.<br />
My guild has asked me to take a role as MT/OT in one of our Kara groups. I have followed one of the gear topics on this forum, and i currently have the clefthoofset, and a running bid on AH for the badge of tenacity. <br />
I would like to update my &quot;still crappy&quot; gear a bit with pvp gear (i have 414 def atm and i have SoF) for the resilience rate.<br />
Can anyone tell me what kind of gear to go for in pvp cos the only druid pvp gear i find is full of + healing and damage, but no pvp gear with +armor, +stam and + agi on it:bonk: , am i overlooking something or haven't i searched in the right place...?<br />
I would prefer BG over arena cos my guild in not strong in pvp arena.<br />
Tnx for the help in advance :grin:</div></div><hr />

Armour is high too. <br />
and yes, it has INT on it to aswell as +heal cause you are a druid and druids are hybrid and at there best if they use all the tricks they got.<br />
<br />
You will put out some nice damage, but the INT and +heal is for your survival cause u have to shapeshift alot in PvP and occasionally u wanna heal yourself too ;D<br />
<br />
So the gear you are looking at is perfect for druid-pvp.<br />
<br />
if u want more attack-strengh then go for the leather-pvp-items which are also suited for rogues.<br />
<br />
look at your playstyle and you will find out what suits you best.<br />

<br />
Just to be clear, is it your intention to pick up pvp gear for the purpose of doing well in pvp?  Or do you want pvp gear to supplement your tanking gear?  I'm assuming the latter..<br />
<br />
The first thing you should know (i guess you probably already know) is that pvp gear has a lot of resilience, and resilience can help you to become uncrittable, which is why we get defense skill.  You can substitute defense skill for resilience.  If you have 120ish resilience, you don't need any defense skill at all!  This means you can afford to drop some of the pieces like the heavy clefthoof set later on when you find gear with superior stats/armor, and even though you lose defense skill, you are still uncrittable due to the resilience from your pvp gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
For entry level pvp gear with a view to tanking, your best bet is to just do a combination of battlegrounds and arenas.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Try to do the daily pvp quest every day if you can.<br />
When you've built up 15k honor or so, go to the Champion's Hall in Stormwind, talk to all the npcs, and look at all the available gear.  Formulate a plan for what gear will benefit you most, first - don't be tempted to just buy the first shiny item you see.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
Okay fair dos - you WILL get owned, and hard, in arena, if you don't have decent gear.  It's depressing but not without a point - arena is an excellent exercise for the mind, and really helps you to achieve that &quot;zen&quot; state where you become one with the battle, and see everything, and how to respond to it.<br />
Chances are you will lose 10 games for the first week - expect this, and then if you win one, it'll be a nice surprise.<br />
At the end of the week, provided your TEAM has played at least TEN GAMES, and you personally have participated in at least 30% of the total games played by the team, you will get some arena points.<br />
<br />
Even if your rating sucks hard, you still get arena points simply for participating.  Suck it up and prepare to lose 10 games a week, for several weeks straight.<br />
After a couple weeks of this, head up to Area 52 in Netherstorm and have a chat with the arena vendors there.  There are 3 different sets of arena gear - generally referred to as &quot;seasons&quot; of gear.<br />
<br />
Season 1 items are prefixed with &quot;Gladiator's..&quot;, so for example, [Gladiator's Maul].<br />
Season 2 is Merciless, eg. [Merciless Gladiator's Maul]<br />
Season 3 is Vengeful, eg. [Vengeful Gladiator's Staff] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33716)<br />
<br />
Season 3 is better than season 2, which is better than season 1.<br />
<br />
The set bonuses between all seasons are interoperable; that is, if you wear 2 pieces of Merciless along with 2 pieces of Vengeful, this is sufficient to get the 4 piece set bonus.<br />
<br />
Season 3 arena gear is the best gear immedietely available to you.  I would recommend starting with the gloves as they are the cheapest season 3 set piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, once you've had a good look at all the gear that is available, formulate a plan - the order in which you will buy the pieces.  Replace your weakest pieces of gear first, if you can.  Also, bear in mind any loots that might drop in Karazhan which you might get - if you're the first in line for a piece of loot and you know you'll be killing the relevant boss soon, it might be worth waiting for that piece of gear, and buying something for a different slot with your honor/arena points.<br />

As always Annikk is the one, who explains it really nicely for beginners/not so experienced ones! <br />
And it seems he is a fast writer too. Cause it would take me really long to write down so much info^^<br />

I hope nobody minds...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowynne</div><div class="date">01-25-2008, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tnx a lot, and yes especially Annikk for the clear explanation.<br />
You were correct about the tanking in pve (will be doing mostly that..) but maybe i will go and try to get some arena experience too, it's just that i don't want to mess up things for my partner :).<br />
I did print out Annikk's great guide on how to tank/heal/pvp and i will start by using the pvp rotation from that (levelled all the way in kitty form, so i became quite handy in it..)<br />
Gonna save up for 15k HP and get an Arena-team, so i will know what to do inbetween the 3 Kara nights.<br />
Tnx a lot again, i really know why i like being a druidsgrove member :whistle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">01-25-2008, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to do arena to get season 1 gear anymore.  That has been moved down to the normal honor vendors.<br />
<br />
Either the season 2 ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31971 )or season 1 ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28129 )shoulders are quite nice for tanking, especially if you put the enchant from exalted Scryers / Aldor on it.  <br />
<br />
Then add the gloves or the helm.  The resilience from the 2 pieces + the 2 pc set bonus from the sets will get you crit immune ( actually, 1 pc will get you crit immune ), but I'm going to assume these pieces are upgrades if you are just stepping into Kara.  <br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
