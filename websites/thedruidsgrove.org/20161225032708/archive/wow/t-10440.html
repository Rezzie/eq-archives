Where can I get a better Mace?  Merchants, or quests.<br />

<br />
Around level 16 it doesn't really matter what weapon you use, as long as it has stats on it.  Cause you will probably be in bear form melee'ing, or caster form rooting and wrathing for every fight.  Weapon dps doesn't matter in feral forms.<br />
<br />
Druid melee weapon dps is pretty bad, considering the lack of armor we have in caster form.  You can still kill things this way, and its good to keep your weapon skills up, though its much faster and easier to fight as bear or cast spells.</div></div><hr />

Where can you get that either than from the AH. Thottbot comments say like...random monsters...and mainly AH. I must...have...that...mace.</div></div><hr />

It's a world drop, meaning just about anything can drop it.  On Malfurion it has come down in price a lot over the last few months.  Keep checking the AH and I'm sure you'll find a good deal on it eventually.  You can also hit the trade channels int he major cities and see if anyone just happens to have one sitting around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-13-2006, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had Blanchard's from the first level I could equip it (45 I believe) up until I was 59 and got Fist of Omokk.  Great 2h Mace.  I just recently saw someone saying WTS Blanchard's stout in the trade channel, and I asked how much, and they said 10g.  Typical price is 35g on the AH, and I turned around and made a 25g profit.  Point is, if you are patient (and seeing as you have 30 levels to save for / search for deal on it), you will be able to find a good deal on one.<br />
<br />
On your way to lv 45, be sure to run Gnomer in your late 20's.  At about lv 27 or so you can get a 2h Mace called the Manual Crowd Pummeler from some boss in gnomer.  It has some insane +str +sta for that level, and a really nice 3 charge proc.  Check it out on Thottbot</div></div><hr />

In general your right, but around level 30 you can get the Staff of Protection from the specialty weapons vendor in Booty Bay.  Pretty nice tanking staff, with AC and resists.</div></div><hr />

All the weapons I ever saw from vendors were gray staves or maces, and cost something ridiculous like 2-3gold.<br />
<br />
I guess thats why its a &quot;specialty weapons vendor&quot;<br />
<br />
There are some killer weapons you can buy from certain vendors, i.e. unstoppable force, ironbarkstaff etc. once you get certain rep with BG's.  I was refering to the weapon vendors in and around ashenvale and all the starting areas.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for pointing that out Rockwell.</div></div><hr />

that's what I've been doing.  Why use Moonfire at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-14-2006, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moonfire I find very useful, espeically for runners.  It's nice to hit them as then run watch them get about 10 or 15 steps and then just drop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-14-2006, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's what I've been doing.  Why use Moonfire at all?<br />
<br />
Moonfire is a great and very usefull spell because it is a Damage over Time spell (DoT).  Which means that once you cast it on someone, it will continue to hurt them for an additional 12 sec or something.  This serves primarily to up your dps while you are throwing around wraths.  It also is very handy incase, as niner said, you are fighting a humanoid, and they try to run.  Your moonfire DoT will kill them before they get far enough to get some help.  And all humanoids run.  <br />
<br />
Good combat strat for your level, if you like to cast:<br />
Root, Faerie Fire, Moonfire, Wrath till dead, refreshing Moonfire when it no longer is 'ticking', or doing damage over time.<br />
<br />
Good combat strat for your level, if you like to tank/bear:<br />
Cast Regrowth and Rejuv on yourself before going to bear form, then just go pound away on them, mauling when you can.  Casting both Heal over Time's on yourself makes you virtually invincible for about 12 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I also have that new staff from the lvl 52 quest, but I use that when I am healing.</div></div><hr />

I don't see what makes it the must have?  The defense?  The &quot;bloody&quot; thing is &quot;bloody&quot; expensive on the AH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-14-2006, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not the +def as that makes very little difference to us in shifted forms, and it is only a must have if you are ever a main tank. Since we don't have shields and def doesn't do anything for us for blocking or parrying we need as much damage mitigation as we can get. <br />
<br />
Put this in with the dire bear multiplier, add the cloak of warding, band of tortise and you've got a pretty good base for getting that 10k AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-14-2006, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warden Staff:<br />
<br />
260ac<br />
11sta<br />
Def +10<br />
<br />
When shifting into DireBear, your base armor is multiplied by 360%.  Which means that the Warden Staff adds 936 Armor, more with talents.  Thats a lot of armor, and if you throw on a +15str enchant you are set for an endgame (tanking) weapon.  Because you can swap weapons while in combat, I keep it in my inventory and swap out with my dps weapon depending on situation.<br />
<br />
I currently have +22 defense in my tanking gear, and it seems like I get critted somehwat less. I seem to recall hearing that +defense reduces your chance to be critted.  I'm not sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balzinn</div><div class="date">04-14-2006, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Increases by 360%, not increases to 360% of base.  Multiply by 4.6 for 1196 armor.  (or 1315 with thick hide)<br />
<br />
+def becomes extremely important as you start to tank mobs over level 60.  If you're tanking in 5 man content, AC and hitpoints are superior.  I shoot for an unbuffed AC between like 10,500 and 11,000 then start swapping in to maximize stamina and defense</div></div><hr />

Just get something that is quick until you can get this mace.  It is freakin awesome, other than the three uses you get to boost +50% attack speed, its good.  Its dps and speed are great.  I like it a lot.  Put some great enchant on it and you'll have a great weapon!! POP A +15 strength enchant on it and beat the holy living crap out of things.  +15 strength is kind of expensive, but if you know how to make World of warcraft gold easily it shouldnt be a problem.  That would be a +31 strength weapon with 2.00 speed and 26 dps, for a level 29 weapon!!! Awesome!<br />
