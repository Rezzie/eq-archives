currently I have 767 healing. I know I need to get to at least 1k for kara and heroics. I am currently spec'd balanced with healer gear. <br />
<br />
So Im now lost. <br />
I know a respec is in my very near future. but should I go for TOL or do a dreamstate build. I still need to grind rep and do dailies for my epic flight. <br />
as Im working on getting my +healing up will rep rewards put me over that magically number to be able to heal kara &amp; etc. <br />
Im really not a big pvp person even tho im on a pvp server. Feral was more fun for pvp than balance. <br />
<br />
Any other advice or tip would be great!<br />

I raised myself Feral, so I had no healing gear whatsoever when I started healing Kara.  I ran to the AH and purchased the best +healing green gear I could find (it's really not that expensive).  I started healing Kara (full-out Tree of Life) with around +925 healing, with success.<br />
<br />
Tree of Life healing is hands down, IMO, the best form of healing a Druid has to offer.....but since you are already Balance and probably already have experience with Balance healing, then you may be interested in trying this spec 34/0/27:<br />

I'm not sure how serious you are about your healing.  For example, do you just want to be able to provide ample back-up healing?  Or do you want to be considered a Main Healer.  It's not the most &quot;ideal&quot; form of healing, but as an experienced Balance player you may absolutely love it.  Also switching to full Resto may come as a bit of &quot;shock&quot; when it comes to soloing.<br />
<br />
I am a Main Healer, and my guildies have allowed me to try this spec because we pretty much have Kara on farm, but as much fun as this spec is to play, I will be trading in my Boomkin for my Tree again soon.  Once a Tree Healer, Always a Tree Healer.  ;) <br />
<br />
PS:  Whatever you do, if you start Kara with this build, make certain that you have 2 other healers with you.  Just trust me on that.</div></div><hr />

Even tho Im spec'd balance Ive been a healer since 61. When I got LB it became easier. I have +877 heal as a balance healer. As I was getting to 70 last nite I actually left a 5man because they wanted me as dps. I had to run 2 5mans to lvl. (I hate UB) <br />
<br />
Ive been thinking about going the AH route to get my gear. I guess I will now =)<br />
<br />
As for a spec. Im really torn. I want TOL but I really like the dreamstate spec you have. And Im gonna miss my treants :( <br />
<br />
I guess Ill decide later today..<br />
Thanks for the imput.</div></div><hr />
