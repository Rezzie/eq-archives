<br />
I've chased behind, to the left and right sides, right on top of them, and EVEN RIGHT THRU THEM and cannot land a mangle or a maim to save my life, spamming like a fool with a full energy bar.  I just get out of range spam for my trouble, then as often as not I get killed by another toon.  Someone must have a solution to this, I hope!<br />

<br />
The range bug is really annoying.  Even more annoying is the fact that it has been known about and even acknowledged by Blizzard for a very long time now.<br />
<br />
First off the good news is that Blizzard have announced they are totally reworking hit boxes in WotLK, and they have noted explicitly that this will fix the cat form range bug.<br />
<br />
In the mean time there are 2 ways to combat the problem, in both your playstyle and your computer setup.<br />
<br />
<br />
First computer setup.  The fact is that the lower your latency, the easier it will be to hit moving targets.<br />
<br />
http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/15500-Smart_fix_allows_you_to_drop_your_ping_by_150<br />
<br />
This link will give you instructions for a fix to Windows XP and Vista based machines that should decrease your ingame latency by up to 150ms at the cost of more bandwidth used by world of warcraft.<br />
I have used this myself and can confirm it really does work and is not just an illusion !<br />
<br />
Second we can look at your playstyle.  Since the bounding box of your catform is restricted by your latency, you need to aim to always be inside your target, preferably a yard or two ahead of where they are going to be.  Get a friend to run around for you and experiment with the range of your attacks on them while they run.  This does take some practice, and a live pvp environment isn't necessarily the best in which to learn.  I would highly recommend the duel scenario with your friend just running from you.<br />

<br />
Hope this helps :&gt;<br />

I'm going to follow the link you posted and apply that fix.  Thanks a ton.<br />

<br />
This is why I shelved Vika for a bit. The hit box bug made me want to tear my hair out. Nothing like spending half a fight with 5 CP's and not being able to get off the finisher.<br />
<br />
I'm trying this as soon as I get home!</div></div><hr />
