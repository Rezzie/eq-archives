<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyte</div><div class="date">10-15-2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I was going through the Recent Updates section of the EQLive site, and was surprised to see all that I had skipped in my hasty reading of the patch message.<br />
<br />
There's a ton of fixes in there, kudos!  Love 'em!  Some could be construed as nerfs though (for certain play styles).<br />
<br />
The ones I noticed the most are...<br />
<br />
1)<br />
POM Revamp<br />
Many people liked it the way it was (or at least the exclusiveness of it).  I'm mostly indifferent right now.  Gotta see what it's like with the change.<br />
<br />
2)<br />
Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the merchant's list.  Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked.  NOTE: This will remove the ability to &quot;recharge&quot; items by selling them to a vendor and buying them back.<br />
<br />
No more item recharging through vendors.  I must admit, I've got an item that I would semi-regularily recharge.  But, I suppose we can't have it both ways.  Can't sell items with different charges as a merchant in the bazaar AND expect to recharge items on vendors... if they use the same code.<br />
<br />
Still, seems like they removed a Plat sink when it seems they are looking for ways to create more Plat sinks.<br />
<br />
:eek: Now there's an idea!  Make a vendor that will recharge items for Plat!<br />
<br />
Anyway... one last one:<br />
3)<br />
<br />
Frenzied Burnout will no longer last indefinitely on a charmed pet.<br />
I personally figured that the &quot;most powerful pet class&quot; should have this particular ability left in place.  I heard that the only lingering components were the flurry and rampage, and that the haste 'buff' actually did drop correctly.  /shrug<br />

Last fix was needed, ever seen a 1200 dps pets in BoT powers? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The recharge nerf kinda sucks. I guess it was a bug all things considered, but really it was the best plat sink around, and they want more of those.</div></div><hr />

Can't remember the number of times that one of those things would wipe half the groups at the top of the stairs in BoT.</div></div><hr />

Shame they couldnt even have bothered to let us know this was going in.<br />
<br />
Last patch was extremely disappointing to wait that long and get so little....and be nerfed.<br />

It was normally a question of how many mobs we could burn through until the mage (and likely a good portion of the group) got eaten.  Good fun though listening to the enchanter taunt the Mage in question... &quot;come on, FB the thing man... what's the worst that could happen?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
this means you can no longer r-click on your hotkey to change track to forage to hide to whatever, whenever... i only ever used 1 ability hotkey and just r-clicked on it to change, never bothering with the damn alt-m window.<br />
<br />
cackles!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those of us who hate the mouse and play classes that have lots of abilities, this is one of the best fixes ever put in the game.  This means you can have all your keys out there somewhere and never have to open that silly abilities window again :)<br />
<br />
[SHIFT-2] 1 [SHIFT-1]  will always be faster than anything you can do with a mouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alyn cross</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">right clicking on the hotkey served the same purpose, that being speed.  and i loathe using extra pages of hotkeys...<br />
<br />
rclick, select function was so much faster than opening that damnable window or shifting to another page of hotkeys...<br />
imo, anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noliniel</div><div class="date">10-16-2003, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, The last 2 nerfs are kinda lame. The last one really bothers me though, I don't recharge any items other than my shrinking devices. So it doesn't mean much to me for the first nerf  but is still lame. =p The mage thingie really owns in BOT Courtyard. Is one of the best places to duo and one of the best xps ever. I can get like 1 aa in 40 minutes or so. Maybe shorter, I don't remember how much =p The bug is the one of main reasons that made it such a good spot for aaxp. You can kill so fast with the mage pet with that aa on. Is so amazing. I am kinda mad at the nerf but I guess I can't do anything about it.</div></div><hr />
