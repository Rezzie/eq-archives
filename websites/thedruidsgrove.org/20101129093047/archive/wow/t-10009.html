<br />
I got 3 one shot kills today and took off 1006 damage on a ?? warrior.<br />
<br />
Pretty cool devise - (don't ask for a nerf on it even though it is WAY overpowered).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea it's fun, the death ray was made for druids with roots and healing.  There are times when it can get you in trouble... when it ticks for 250 dmg on a heavy hit it can leave you exposed... ofcourse it's gonna slam whoever it hits for 2k dmg 8)<br />
<br />
The best bit' is vs. other druids... hibernate + death-ray can be the burst you need to end a survival fest'</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's that good for PvP then I would consider changing just for that kinda stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Engineering is the most helpful pvp profession there is.  It's main is is for pvp encounters in my opinion.  It is not a profession to make money, but it does add alot of fun to the game.<br />
<br />
Concerning professions like leatherworking - they are pretty cool and all but you can get better stuff off drops.  This is the same for tailors and smithys.<br />
<br />
I go with engineering because it's my 'gear advantage' that I have over others.  I don't have awesome gear because I don't do alot of instance runs and it is my way of evening things out and having fun while doing it.<br />
<br />
I also have skinning as my other profession.  I like skinning and never wanted to give it up.  People say it costs 100's of gold to level engineering without mining and I didn't find this to be true.  I got to about 225 with about 15g.  225-261 for about 15g as well.  I bid low on the items I needed and generally didn't use a buyout.  It took awhile but I didn't care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm....if it's that helpful for PvP then I might just have to learn a new profession tonight.  Does it help with end-game too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't found a ton of pve uses for engineering.  I guess you could shoot your deathray every 5 min and get some extra damage.<br />
<br />
Goblin jumper cables can rez people but if you already have rez it doesn't make a difference.  Non-rez classes benefit great from this.<br />
<br />
If anyone has an insight on end game uses, fill me in cause I can't think of alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we do have rez....but it's only every 30 minutes and requires a reagent....<br />
<br />
I would also like any insight engineering might have....because if it is truly helpful I would consider changing my profession.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like most professions its more for flavor than substance.  There are some neat toys, but nothing we can't achieve some other way really (for instance theres a helm that lets you breathe underwater, or a net gun to &quot;root&quot; opponents).  What ever you do don't try using the engineering &quot;pets&quot; in instances.  My brother nearly causes a wipe every time he unleashes his robotic &quot;battle chicken&quot; which is uncontrollable and aggros everything while pecking away to little effect.<br />
<br />
I personally think the profession with the biggest effect on your stats and abilities is alchemy, but if you make enough with your other professions you can always buy the pots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Engineering unlike everything else is exclusive.  You can't use all the cool gizmos without being an engineer whereas you can use potions if you are not an alchemist.<br />
<br />
All in all it's more for fun and messing with people in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">02-03-2006, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Engineering has some PvE uses.  Raiding, repair bots are awfully useful when your learning MC/BWL.  Tanking, the first time I went to tank 5 man scholo' I brought 20 grenades to pull with... it's great giving the mage/priest 2 seconds to crowd CC plus you can spread moonfire's or thorn/rejuv.  Target dummies have served me to varrying degree's of success... Master Works can take a few blows from a level 60 mob, and sometimes that's all you need to make the differnece between living and dying.<br />
<br />
Leveling up mini-harvest reapers are a great 10min DPS boost grinding from 30-40 and trinket pets do decent damage for solo'n elietes.<br />
<br />
PvP it really opens up some things that a druid without engineer'n can't do.  In AB defending the flag with dynamite/grenades from multiple cappers and being able to CC and cap with either the rocket-helm, MC cap or Frost reflector.  In WSG I've left two hunters trap'ed in the flag room while I made off with the flag.<br />
<br />
Alot of engineering is situational.... with the cooldowns and equip-to-use requirements your not going to be using it all the time... but it's pretty easy to see how it's on the cusp' of being overpowering and without the downsides it surely would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the same way that advanced leatherworkers can choose between 3 &quot;schools&quot; of leatherworking (tribal, elemental, or dragonscale), advanced engineers can choose between Goblin Engineering or Gnomish Engineering.<br />
<br />
As a brief summary, goblin engineering deals primarily with bombs.  There are some seriously awesome bombs out there, such as the Arcane Bomb which does a huge manasteal in an area of effect, or the Dark Iron Bomb which does like 800 damage in a big AOE and incapacitates all targets in that AOE for 4 seconds.  Goblin Engineers can also make the Jumper Cables XL, which have actually have a good chance of working, as opposed to the normal jumper cables which fail 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
Gnomish Engineering on the other hand is more of a novelty and utility profession.  For example, the deathray is made by gnomish engineers.  Other awesome stuff includes the Shrink Ray, which, hilariously, works on almost all world bosses, including Onyxia and Ragnaros... fighting a tiny onyxia is pretty damn funny.  :)<br />
<br />
Some gnomish-made engineering items can be used by goblin engineers as well, and likewise some goblin engineering items can also be used by gnomish engineers.  There are a few bits and pieces that require a specific school of engineering to use/equip, however.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the battle chicken.  If you get this chicken very early, it will be up to 20 levels higher than you, and so can be very useful when trying to kill a mob that is much higher level than you are.  Also the chicken gives you a buff - Battle Squawk.<br />
<br />
<br />
One final note - many engineering items (particularly gnomish items) have a chance to backfire.  For example, the shrink ray can sometimes inadvertantly shrink you and your entire party.  Once you've chosen a school of engineering there is no going back, so do your research carefully before choosing! :)<br />
