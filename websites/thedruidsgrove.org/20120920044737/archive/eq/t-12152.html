<br />
1-3 and 5 Kelliad missions you talk to Meldrek south of Kelliad to transport to a Stoneroot instance. You ultimately battle into/collect around Xill to the south, right before hive.<br />
<br />
4th you enter the instance by going to Xil and clicking the inner gates.<br />
<br />
We had druid with a shammy backup healing doing these. Worked well.<br />
<br />
Don't want to spoil anything but if your mana pool isn't &gt;7-8k, mission 5 could be tough without cleric.</div></div><hr />

I have to admit I don't really understand the logic or math involved in how it calculates if/when this actually goes off.<br />
 <br />
It says its a 400 adjustment proc.  No clue what that means.<br />
 <br />
So lets pick an raid mob umm lets say like King/Queen in Riftseekers for example.  How many times in a minute would they hit a tank and how many times would this proc go off.<br />
 <br />
I see it says &quot;up to 120&quot; times in 1 minute.  If that were the case it would heal 72,000 HP in one minute which would be a hugely efficient heal over time, but what is the math involved that would make this proc 120 times?<br />
 <br />
I'm sure someone out there parsed this or has the info.  You guys are great.<br />

<br />
Like Negian said, it doesn't go off every hit... it's a proc, it has the randomness of one. It goes off whenever it wants to basically :p</div></div><hr />

I was in a group doing DoD progressions and we were using a ranger as our tank.  I put this on him and he asked the group how he was being healed for 600's.  There was no other regen going at the time I was aware of.<br />
<br />
I like to use this on the monks pulling in anguish too!</div></div><hr />

And it HAS to be our best defensive spell after evac...<br />
If they had to make it not stack with something, could it be some/all SK recourse effects please?<br />

Thats the link to the Cleric DoN Selfbuff.  It has stacking issues with several similar effects, including the new DoD Mage Burning Aura Buff.<br />
 <br />
These are Defensive (?) Procs which attack the person in return.  It makes logical sense for them not to stack.  The best one will hold over the others.<br />
 <br />
Lingering Sloth, on the other hand, is a Defensive buff which lowers incoming melee.  This is differant from the Vie line as it is not a mitigation increase, but rather a attack speed decrease.  The mob will still hit just as hard reguardless.<br />
 <br />
Skin of the Reptile and Oaken Guard are Defensive procs.  They are alike in their intent.  One Heals damage done so you don't die.  The other, fires a -400 Hate proc, which basically in effect, lowers your aggro so - you don't die.  They are both spells which prevent, or at least make it more difficult to kill someone.<br />
 <br />
Sloth does this to a degree, but since most mobs as such a high level, they would mitigate the 25 percent slow so heavily that is not a drastic advantage as may be afforded via either of the 2 Druid spells.<br />
 <br />
That said, assume you Are using Oaken Guard to make youself mitigate 75 percent of incoming melee damage.  You also have Reptile on.  Unless the mob hits drastically hard, this more or less gives you a DA style effect becuase OG lowers the incoming melee so much that Reptile can and will realistically heal for more then the resulting damage after OG's mitigation.  Depending on mob, this could be very powerful, and I personally consider it overbalancing.<br />
 <br />
As is, with Hungry Vines, Oaken Guard and Reptile, it is freaking hard to die if you have decent gear to anything that is hitting less then 600 one on one.  You can actually tank several mobs at the same time, using only reptile if they are hitting for 1-200.  <br />

I think the total healed per fight was between 4800 to 7800 hp total.<br />
All in all a very nice defensive spell to have.</div></div><hr />

I don't even heal the tank in creator anymore unless he has 3 or more mobs on him, I just throw on the skin.<br />

with the exception of the root (what did that do again? pop a mob a mile high? who cares) I'm lovin our DoD spells.</div></div><hr />

I've seen this happen on my duoing partner often - a Beastlord. I wish Juniper was on a seperate account so I could 2 box her with my main. I can think of about a dozen things I'd like to try with just Reptile Skin backing me up.<br />

With clickie items, full raid buffs, mgb hots and single HoTs + assorted other single target buffs the MA usually has on raid, it is very easy to run out of buffslots, even if he/she has all the buff slots aa.</div></div><hr />

Any MA who doesn't make room for reptile is a moron.  Healing effects aside, there's few buffs that'll add more aggro than reptile - and that alone will make it take priority over any atk buff etc.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha my thoughts exactly. Pisses me off a lot when either a tank clicks it off or it doesn't stick. One of our tanks did the click off thing on the early DP days, well he quickly learned otherwise from angry druids!</div></div><hr />
