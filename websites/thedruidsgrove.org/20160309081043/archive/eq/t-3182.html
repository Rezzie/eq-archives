<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nosforatu Nytewind</div><div class="date">03-29-2003, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this is related to equipment, decided I would try post my questions/concerns here.  I recently upgraded a few items that I thought would help me out a little bit more, namely:<br />
<br />
Obsidian Necklace (Mana Preservation 10%)<br />
Bracelet of Darkness (Mana Preservation on Dots 30%)<br />
Ceramic Gavel of Justic (Affliction Eff. 4)<br />
<br />
Now, as it turns out, if I cast a DoT spell, my bracelet glows but my gavel doesn't.  If I take off my bracelet, the obsidian necklace glows but the gavel doesn't, if I take off necklace and bracelet THEN the gavel glows and takes affect.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what the deal is with that?  I can't seem to get my focus effect items to stack, I've tried to petition and /bug it but I get no response as usual.  Anyone else have this problem?<br />
<br />
Also, I heard that Brilliance of Ro (on Crown of Energy) isn't working either.  This really sucks to have upgraded all these focus effects to have them all broken =(</div></div><hr />

The &quot;higher&quot; one will always take effect.<br />
<br />
So if I have 2 items with mana preservation, one with 10% and one with 20%, the 20% one will ALWAYS take precedence.  The 10% one will never be used (unless I take the 20% one off of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nosforatu Nytewind</div><div class="date">04-05-2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I realize that they aren't supposed to stack with each other, the problem is this, the Affliction Efficency 4 item and the Mana Preservation item are NOT stacking.<br />
<br />
This is my main concern, recently had a chance to get an Affliction Extenstion 4 item, but if I keep having these stacking problems, there really is no point.<br />
<br />
So again, anyone have any problems stacking a Vex Thall focus item with other focus items, i.e. Ceramic Gavel of Justice and Bracelet of Darkness?</div></div><hr />

AE4 items just have the restriction of only working on DoTs, so when you cast a DoT your AE4 item will go off becuase it will have a higher percentage then the MP item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Geez, I also thought efficency was something more like... does more damage than normal effect... but that is extended affliction, i'm so retarded!<br />
<br />
Argh, alright, thanks again for your advice guys, helped remind me how stupid I sound, heh.<br />
<br />
Oh, is there an Extended Affliction 4 item for range btw?</div></div><hr />
