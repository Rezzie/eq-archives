<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulfvar</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like many others, i have been more or less a lurker, and soaking up the knowledge of so many others. Up untill recently i have been able to find an answer or advice somewhere within this forum. This is truely one of the best communities.<br />
<br />
As the title indicates, I noticed an issue with the length of time before my armor's durability was nearing the constraints of its use. <br />
<br />
My Druid is but 46, and feral(following the 14/30/5). I tank most often for instances and had not really noticed the effect it had upon my gear until this past weekend.<br />
<br />
I tanked RFD from start to Glutton, when my gear started to show that little icon.. I use Titan panel for the over all durability, and saw that i was down to 30%.  We were hardly even half way thru the mission, and i had repaired in Theramore right before it.<br />
<br />
I chalked it up to the fact that there was only 2 of us in there, me and another Druid (level39). She healed for the most part, and was some DPS when able. We cleared from the entrance to the first named (Spider is it), then the dancing skelly and his followers, Glutton, and just a little beyond him.<br />
<br />
Seeing as how there is very little indoor CC with just the 2 of us, i was tanking up to 4 - 5 mobs at a time. So was getting  beat on pretty well.<br />
I tried going back in with a pally that i have at the same level, and compared the durability.. grant it plate to leather.. no brainer.. <br />
I then did it with a hunter i have, level 50, and i tanked with my hunter, not using the pet for tanking. Again looked at my durability. Again, mail vs leather i know.<br />
<br />
What i saw tho was a massive differ between the leather to mail. leather to plate. But the mail to plate was almost the same, and very low damage taken to the gear.<br />
<br />
Is there or does it become viable as a bear tank at some point in the near future? i have roughly 5.9k AC, and 4.3k hp.<br />
I wear mostly blue items mixed with some green that we have farmed or made, as well as the Wardens Staff.<br />
I am more or less worried that this will become more apparent as i progess further along the line. Having great AC, and HP is of very little use if you cant go the distance with your durability.<br />
<br />
Any light, or advice that anyone has to offer would be appreciated. Later the gear may be more durable for the level of mobs i will plow thru. Or maybe it is that i have to look for certain types of armor. At the moment i a more concerned with the idea of not being able to get to the end of a long instance due to gear itself becoming useless, or red.<br />

I'm a 60 druid who follows a 0/30/21 build, with every single talent that I can get related to bears. (Although I only have 3 points into the one that adds cat stealth / bear threat %.. can't remember it's name.) And am totally geared around tanking, but I've never noticed a difference in my armor's length of durability compared to plate durability. And yes I MT in nearly every instance, so I don't think that would be the issue... personally, I think it's your armor value. I don't quite know how it works but my armor is always at an easy 10k unbuffed, which takes off alot of the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats weird, I don't think certain types of armor lose durability quicker than others.  Though I do know that certain types are more expensive to repair.  Did you die at all when you were tanking on your druid?  Every time you die to a mob you lose 10% durability.  This could have something to do with it.  <br />

Btw Flix, Ulfvar, Welcome to TDG :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ulfvar</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many thanks.<br />
<br />
No deaths during that run. Started at 100%, and was at 30% after Glutton. Something just did not seem right about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks as well, and yeah I really can't think of anything that could be the issue there. It's possible that the difference may have been a result of you getting crited more or dodging less..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakiniku</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering you had 3 people, you may not have been killing mobs as fast.  Therefore, you may have sustained more damage as a result of getting beat on longer.  <br />
<br />
I'm taking a guess, but it may have to do with the total amount of damage you take.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I too have noticed my durability going down faster on the blue PvP set as of late.  Before I could go through a day of PvP and feel very little loss maybe a 50sp repair bill, lately after a hard day of PvP I've been having 2gp repair bills.  Once my shoulders were even red on the little stick man but the rest of my gear was still doing ok, it's very strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... could just be something about the length of time you were getting pounded on.  I'm always tanking, and  I've noticed that in 5mans if I'm in a good group with a bit of CC and some good DPS, my repair bill is extremely cheap at the end of run, but if the group's not the best, and I find myself sitting there tanking 4 things of my level at once a lot, and people aren't assisting off the same target so things take forever to die, then my repair bill will skyrocket.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing if you would have had a full group, it'd have been better, or if you had some CC (despite the fact that bears tank multiple targets well, CC should still be used when possible, unless the mobs are super easy, for this reason and to keep the healers' mana up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably just some of the variables posted above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">10-17-2006, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea. Personally I was still in level 35-45 feral greens @ 60 (Yes sad I know) and in my first couple weeks of endgame my repairs were rarely over 1gold.<br />
<br />
Had my first full repair last week where everything was completely broken and it cost me 12g =(</div></div><hr />
