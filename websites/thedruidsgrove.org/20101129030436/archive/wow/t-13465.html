Call of the Crusade<br />
<br />
-  Since the opening of the Argent Tournament in northeastern Icecrown,<br />
   adventurers have journeyed from across Azeroth and beyond to prove<br />
   their worth in the heart of the Lich King's domain. Under thundering<br />
   skies the tournament's participants hone the arts of war and face<br />
   off in bone-shattering jousting matches to earn the right to be<br />
   called champions. Yet these heroes have yet to face the greatest<br />
   challenge of all: the Crusaders' Coliseum. Formidable Horde and<br />
   Alliance champions, ferocious beasts, and Scourge lieutenants are<br />
   just some of the opponents awaiting adventurers in this gladiatorial<br />
   arena. Few will survive the coliseum's perils, but the Argent<br />
   Crusade is confident that the worthy heroes who do emerge victorious<br />
   will be ready to join the offensive against Icecrown Citadel and end<br />
   the Lich King's reign of terror.<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest<br />
<br />
-  Off the coast of Northrend, Horde and Alliance forces are locked in<br />
   an epic struggle for a tiny island rich in resources. Known as the<br />
   Isle of Conquest, this rocky battleground's proximity to Icecrown<br />
   makes it a highly prized base in the war against the Lich King. Both<br />
   factions have deployed devastating weapons to drive each other from<br />
   this strategic location. Day and night the ground trembles under<br />
   lumbering siege vehicles while monstrous airships pummel enemy<br />
   positions with fiery cannons. The bloody conflict spreads to every<br />
   corner of the island as new heroes arrive to aid their factions. It<br />
   remains to be seen whose banner will wave triumphantly over the Isle<br />
   of Conquest and at what cost victory will be achieved.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
-  Construction of the Crusaders’ Coliseum is complete. New raid normal<br />
   and Heroic modes for the Crusaders’ Coliseum can be toggled using<br />
   the Dungeon Difficulty setting. This applies to 10 and 25-player<br />
   versions. 10-player (normal), 25-player (normal), 10-player (Heroic)<br />
   and 25-player (Heroic) all share separate raid lockout timers.<br />
-  Trial of the Champion<br />
   5-player (normal and Heroic mode) dungeon.<br />
   Daily quest added to the Heroic daily dungeon quest giver.<br />
-  Trial of the Crusader<br />
   10 and 25-player (normal mode) raid dungeon.<br />
-  Trial of the Grand Crusader<br />
   10 and 25-player (Heroic mode) raid dungeon.<br />
   Crusaders’ Tribute: Active on Heroic difficulty only, the tribute<br />
   system will limit players on the number of attempts the raid is<br />
   allotted each week. Additional rewards can be earned depending on<br />
   the number of attempts left in the tribute run each week when the<br />
   final boss is defeated.<br />
-  Head to the new 40 vs. 40-player siege-style Battleground, the Isle<br />
   of Conquest, to vie for control of a strategic location with a host<br />
   of resources sought by the Horde and Alliance.<br />
-  Two level brackets are available: 71-79 and 80.<br />
-  Defend the walls of your keep and protect your general by killing<br />
   enemy players and destroying their siege vehicles.<br />
-  Capture the Docks, Gunship Hangar, or Siege Workshop for access to<br />
   destructive siege vehicles or strategic attacks on your enemy’s<br />
   base.<br />
-  Capture the Refinery or Quarry for their resources to garner<br />
   reinforcements, a steady flow of bonus honor and a 15% increase to<br />
   siege vehicle damage for each of these capture points your team<br />
   controls.<br />
-  To claim victory, bust through the enemy’s keep walls (or find other<br />
   ways to get inside) and kill their general, or obliterate your<br />
   opponents until their reinforcements are depleted.<br />
-  The Argent Tournament Expands<br />
-  All new Argent Crusader daily quests and rewards have been added for<br />
   players with the Crusader title. Rewards include a new Argent<br />
   Crusader banner and tabard (which can port players to the tournament<br />
   grounds), a mounted squire (can periodically run bank, mail or<br />
   vendor errands for the player), a paladin-exclusive Argent Crusader<br />
   Charger mount and new heirloom items.<br />
-  All new Silver Covenant and Sunreaver daily quests and rewards have<br />
   been added for players exalted with these factions. Rewards include<br />
   tabards, new ground and flying mounts and a new pet.<br />
-  Just when you thought you had seen the last of the Black Knight, he<br />
   makes his astonishing return to the tournament. Wait, didn’t you<br />
   kill him?<br />
-  New Dungeon Loot Feature<br />
   Players will now be able to trade soulbound items with other raid or<br />
   group members that were eligible for the loot. This system will work<br />
   like the Item Buy Back system and allow 2 hours for players to trade<br />
   an item after it has been looted. Players who choose to enchant or<br />
   add gems to the item will get one last confirmation before losing<br />
   the ability to trade the item.<br />
-  New druid art for Cat Form and Bear Form has been added. There are<br />
   now five unique color schemes for each form and faction. Changing<br />
   hair color (night elves) or skin tone (tauren) via the barbershop<br />
   will change the look of one’s cat and bear forms. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
-  Arenas<br />
-  Beginning with season 7, players will no longer have access to the<br />
   newest season’s weapons or shoulder armor and will not qualify for<br />
   the Gladiator title/rewards with ratings from the 2v2 bracket alone.<br />
   Ratings obtained through 3v3 and 5v5 game play will be required for<br />
   these rewards, while the rest of the newest season’s items will<br />
   remain available to players in all brackets (standard rating<br />
   restrictions still apply).<br />
-  Dalaran Sewers<br />
   The entire Arena has increased in size by 25%.<br />
   Mounts can now be used in this Arena.<br />
   The position and collision of the crates on the central platform has<br />
   been modified.<br />
-  Ring of Valor<br />
   The flame wall has been removed.<br />
-  Ruins of Lordaeron<br />
   Alcoves have been removed from the starting chambers.<br />
   The collision around the central tomb has been smoothed out to<br />
   prevent players from becoming stuck on the terrain as often.<br />
-  Battlegrounds<br />
-  Battleground experience has arrived!<br />
   Players will now be awarded experience for completing objectives and<br />
   actions that yield honor in Battlegrounds (honorable kills not<br />
   included).<br />
   Players who do not wish to gain experience through PvP can visit<br />
   Behsten in Stormwind or Slahtz in Orgrimmar – both located near the<br />
   Battlemasters in either city – and turn off all experience<br />
   accumulation for the cost of 10 gold. <br />
   Disabling experience gains will prevent a player from gaining<br />
   experience through any means available in the game. <br />
   Players with experience gains turned off who compete in<br />
   Battlegrounds will face off only against other players with<br />
   experience gains turned off. <br />
   Behsten and Slahtz can reinstate experience gains for players, for a<br />
   10 gold fee of course. Any experience that would’ve been accumulated<br />
   if experience gains were enabled cannot be recovered.<br />
-  Battlemasters in major cities affiliated with specific Battlegrounds<br />
   have been replaced with a Battlemaster for each faction that will<br />
   allow players to queue for any Battleground. Battlemasters for<br />
   specific Battlegrounds will still be seen around the cities during<br />
   corresponding Battleground holiday weekends.<br />
-  When standing at a capture point that you control, you will gain a<br />
   buff called Honorable Defender. This buff grants +50% honor gained<br />
   from kills. This currently affects Arathi Basin, Eye of the Storm<br />
   and Isle of Conquest.<br />
-  Arathi Basin<br />
   The time it requires to capture a base has been reduced to 8<br />
   seconds, down from 10 seconds.<br />
   The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down<br />
   from 2000.<br />
-  Eye of the Storm<br />
   The time it requires to capture the center flag has been reduced to<br />
   8 seconds, down from 10 seconds<br />
   The game now ends when one team reaches 1600 victory points, down<br />
   from 2000.<br />
-  Strand of the Ancients<br />
   The faction starting on attack/defense will now be randomized at the<br />
   start of each match.<br />
-  Warsong Gulch<br />
   There is a now a 20-minute timer on this Battleground. After that<br />
   time, the team with the most flag captures wins. If this would<br />
   result in a tie, the team that captured the first flag wins. If<br />
   neither side has captured a flag, then the game ends in a tie.<br />
-  Wintergrasp<br />
-  Against the Odds: This achievement has been removed and converted to<br />
   a Feat of Strength.<br />
-  Industrial Warfare: This achievement has been removed.<br />
-  To provide players with a more transparent notification of when<br />
   Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population<br />
   and stability, several changes have been made.<br />
   Players now have the option to queue for Wintergrasp from a<br />
   Wintergrasp Battlemaster in any capital city or by simply entering<br />
   the Wintergrasp zone.<br />
   Queuing will begin 15 minutes before each battle. If chosen, you<br />
   will automatically be teleported to the zone. Any players in the<br />
   zone who have not been chosen from the queue will be teleported out<br />
   when the battle begins.<br />
   The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a<br />
   player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.<br />
   Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you<br />
   have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you<br />
   are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported<br />
   out if you try to land and join the battle.<br />
   Level 80 players get higher priority in the queue than lower level<br />
   players. In addition, a random selection of queued players will be<br />
   taken from both the Battlemasters and the zone itself.<br />
   The queue will accept up to 120 players from each faction, resulting<br />
   in a maximum battle of 240 players at a time.<br />
-  Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
-  Dungeon and Raid ID Extensions<br />
   In order to allow for parties and raids to progress through<br />
   instances at their own pace, players can now extend an instance ID<br />
   on an individual basis.<br />
   Existing or recently expired IDs can be extended via the Social tab<br />
   under Raid by clicking on Raid Info.<br />
   The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended.<br />
   Doing so will extend the instance lock period by the same amount of<br />
   time as the original lock (i.e. extending an Ulduar instance ID will<br />
   add 7 days, a Heroic: Halls of Lightning instance ID will add 24<br />
   hours, and a Zul’Gurub instance ID will add 3 days to the instance<br />
   lock time).<br />
   An ID can be extended more than once.<br />
   An extension can be reversed on an individual basis provided the<br />
   player does not do anything in the instance during the extended<br />
   instance lock period that would save that player to the instance.<br />
-  Emblem System Changes<br />
   Both the 10 and 25-player instances of the Crusaders’ Coliseum drop<br />
   a new Emblem of Triumph.<br />
   Any dungeons that previously dropped Emblems of Heroism or Valor,<br />
   such as Naxxramas or Heroic Halls of Stone, will now drop Emblems of<br />
   Conquest instead. Emblems of Conquest can still be converted to<br />
   Valor or Heroism.<br />
   The Heroic dungeon daily quest will now reward 2 Emblems of Triumph<br />
   and the normal daily dungeon quest will reward 1 Emblem of Conquest.<br />
   New achievements have been added to collect various amounts of any<br />
   combination of emblems.<br />
-  25-player raids will no longer be referred to as Heroic versions of<br />
   a raid, as there is a new distinction between normal and Heroic<br />
   modes for both 10 and 25 player versions of the Crusaders’ Coliseum.<br />
-  The Nexus: The Oculus &amp; The Eye of Eternity<br />
   Drakes used by players in these instances will now scale in health<br />
   and damage according to the rider's average item level.<br />
-  Ulduar<br />
   Players can now use Blink, Shadowstep, and Demonic Teleport while<br />
   participating in the illusion events in the Yogg-Saron encounter.<br />
-  Ominous Clouds in the Yogg-Saron encounter are now more vocal about<br />
   touching players and should no longer sometimes appear to be in the<br />
   wrong place for certain players.<br />
-  An Immortal Guardian targeted for Empowering Shadows in the<br />
   Yogg-Saron encounter will now become a 'Marked Immortal Guardian'<br />
   while targeted.<br />
-  Crusher Tentacles in the Yogg-Saron encounter spawn a little slower<br />
   in 25-player mode allowing a bit more time for players to clear out<br />
   the Illusion room.<br />
-  Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter now targets a maximum<br />
   of three Immortal Guardians in 25-player mode.<br />
-  Yogg-Saron's health has been reduced by 20% in the final stage of<br />
   his 25-player mode.<br />
-  Winter Jormungars will no longer put everyone in the zone in combat<br />
   when they emerge from a Snow Mound. Additionally, Snow Mounds will<br />
   now disappear when all their jormungars have emerged.<br />
   <br />
Races: General<br />
<br />
-  Axe Specialization (Orc): The weapon bonus from this effect now<br />
   applies to fist weapons in addition to axes.<br />
-  Tauren now have the option of changing skin tone by visiting the<br />
   barber shop.<br />
<br />
Items: General<br />
<br />
-  Agility: The amount of agility required per percentage of dodge has<br />
   been increased by 15%. This change required recalibrating the amount<br />
   of dodge a player has with 0 agility by a slight amount as well, so<br />
   all players will see their dodge percentage vary a small amount.<br />
-  Block Value: The amount of bonus block value on all items has been<br />
   doubled. This does not affect the base block value on shields or<br />
   block value derived from strength.<br />
-  On-Use Block Value Items: All items and set bonuses that trigger<br />
   temporary increases to block value have been modified. Instead of<br />
   increasing their block value amount by 100% like other items, they<br />
   have all had their effect durations doubled. This applies to Glyph<br />
   of Deflection, Gnomeregan Autoblocker, Coren’s Lucky Coin,<br />
   Lavanthor’s Talisman, Libram of Obstruction, Tome of the<br />
   Lightbringer, Libram of the Sacred Shield, the tier-8 paladin Shield<br />
   of Righteousness bonus, the tier-5 paladin Holy Shield bonus, and<br />
   the tier-5 warrior Shield Block bonus.<br />
-  Dodge Rating: The amount of dodge rating required per percentage of<br />
   dodge has been increased by 15%. This is before diminishing returns.<br />
   Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry<br />
   rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply.<br />
-  Item Buy Back Feature Revised<br />
   The Item Buy Back time will now expire if the player enchants or<br />
   sockets an item. Players will see a confirmation dialog box now when<br />
   they attempt to enchant or add gems to an item giving them a last<br />
   chance to reconsider.<br />
-  Items with Triggered Effects: These items generally have cooldowns<br />
   on how often they can be triggered. Those cooldowns are now<br />
   triggered each time the item is equipped (example: A trinket has a<br />
   45-second cooldown on an effect triggered by player attacks; when a<br />
   player equips that item, the effect will be unable to be triggered<br />
   for the first 45 seconds it is worn).<br />
-  Mounts<br />
   The cast time for summoning any ground mount is now 1.5 seconds, <br />
   down from 3 seconds.<br />
   Apprentice Riding (Skill 75): Can now be learned at level 20 for 4<br />
   gold. Mail will be sent to players who reach level 20 directing them<br />
   to the riding trainer.<br />
   Journeyman Riding (Skill 150): Can now be learned at level 40 for 50<br />
   gold. Mail will be sent to players who reach level 40 directing them<br />
   back to the riding trainer.<br />
   Expert Riding (Skill 225): Can now be learned at level 60 for 600<br />
   gold from trainers in Honor Hold or Thrallmar. Faction discounts now<br />
   apply (Honor Hold for Alliance; Thrallmar for Horde). Flight speed<br />
   at this skill level has been increased to 150% of run speed, up from<br />
   60%.<br />
   Artisan Riding (Skill 300): Faction discounts now apply (Honor Hold<br />
   or Valiance Expedition for Alliance; Thrallmar or Warsong Offensive<br />
   for Horde).<br />
   In order to further equalize the number of purchasable mounts<br />
   available to each race, a new 60% speed ground mount has been added<br />
   for night elves, and a new 100% speed ground mount has been added<br />
   for the undead.<br />
   Flying over Dalaran and Wintergrasp is now possible so long as<br />
   players keep a healthy distance above the ground.<br />
-  Mana Regeneration: All items that provide “X mana per five seconds”<br />
   have had the amount of mana they regenerate increased by<br />
   approximately 25%.<br />
-  Parry Rating: The amount of parry rating required per percentage of<br />
   parry has been reduced by 8%. This is before diminishing returns.<br />
   Combined with other changes, this makes dodge rating and parry<br />
   rating equally potent before diminishing returns apply. Parry still<br />
   diminishes more quickly than dodge.<br />
-  Resilience: No longer reduces the amount of damage done by<br />
   damage-over-time spells, but instead reduces the amount of all<br />
   damage done by players by the same proportion. In addition, the<br />
   amount of resilience needed to reduce critical strike chance,<br />
   critical strike damage and overall damage has been increased by 15%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-  All pets now receive 40% of their master’s resilience and 100% of<br />
   their master’s spell penetration. In addition, if a player is at<br />
   their appropriate spell hit chance or hit chance maximum, their pet<br />
   will be at the maximum for spell hit chance, hit chance, and<br />
   expertise. If they are below the maximum, their pet will be<br />
   proportionately below those maximums.<br />
-  Replenishment: This buff now grants 1% of the target’s maximum mana<br />
   over 5 seconds instead of 0.25% per second. This applies to all 5<br />
   sources of Replenishment (Vampiric Touch, Judgements of the Wise,<br />
   Hunting Party, Enduring Winter Frostbolts and Soul Leech).<br />
-  Silence, Strangulate, Silencing Shot, and Arcane Torrent: These<br />
   abilities will also apply a 3-second Interrupt effect against<br />
   non-player controlled targets, making them more versatile against<br />
   creatures immune to silencing effects.<br />
<br />
Death Knights<br />
<br />
-  Due to significant talent changes, all death knight talents will be<br />
   reset for players.<br />
-  Blood Plague: Damage done increased by 15%.<br />
-  Chains of Ice: Now reduces movement by 95% instead of 100%. The main<br />
   effect of this change will be that targets of Chains of Ice will not<br />
   have to re-issue a movement command to continue moving.<br />
-  Frost Fever: Damage done increased by 15%.<br />
-  Frost Presence: 10% bonus health reduced to 6% bonus stamina.<br />
-  Frost Strike: This ability can now be dodged, parried, or blocked.<br />
   Weapon damage bonus reduced to 55%, down from 60%.<br />
-  Icebound Fortitude: Cooldown increased to 2 minutes.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Blood<br />
   Bloody Strikes: This talent now provides 5/10/15% increased damage<br />
   to Blood Strike instead of 15/30/45%.<br />
   Dancing Rune Weapon: This ability now has a fixed duration of 12<br />
   seconds (which can still be modified by its glyph) and a fixed cost<br />
   of 60 runic power.<br />
-  Veteran of the Third War: Stamina bonus reduced to 1/2/3%.<br />
-  Frost<br />
   Blood of the North: Reduced to a 3-point talent. Increases Blood<br />
   Strike and Frost Strike damage by 3/6/10%. There is now a<br />
   33/66/100% chance whenever you hit with Blood Strike or Pestilence<br />
   that the Blood Rune will become a Death Rune when it activates.<br />
   Lichborne: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to<br />
   2 minutes.<br />
   Threat of Thassarian: New 3-point talent. When dual-wielding, your<br />
   Death Strikes, Obliterates, Plague Strikes, Blood Strikes and Frost<br />
   Strikes have a 30/60/100% chance to also deal damage with your<br />
   off-hand weapon. Off-hand strikes are roughly one half the effect of<br />
   the original strike. <br />
   Toughness: This talent now grants 2/4/6/8/10% armor instead of<br />
   3/6/9/12/15%, placing it in line with similar abilities of other<br />
   classes.<br />
-  Unholy<br />
   Desecration: This talent has been reduced to 2 points for 25/50%<br />
   snare and no longer increases damage done by the death knight. It<br />
   has also been moved one tier earlier in the tree and its spell<br />
   effect has been made more transparent.<br />
   Desolation: New talent. This talent is in the position formerly<br />
   occupied by Desecration. It causes Blood Strikes to increase all<br />
   damage the death knight deals by 1/2/3/4/5% for 12 seconds.<br />
   Scourge Strike: Weapon damage bonus reduced to 40%, down from 45%.<br />
   Damage increased by 10% per disease on the target, down from 11%.<br />
   Summon Gargoyle: The gargoyle now flies lower to the ground, making<br />
   it susceptible to melee attacks. This ability now has a fixed<br />
   duration of 30 seconds and a fixed cost of 60 runic power.<br />
   Unholy Blight: This talent has been redesigned. It no longer deals<br />
   damage to nearby targets. Instead, when you deal damage with Death<br />
   Coil, the target will take periodic damage for 10 seconds equal to<br />
   20% of the damage done by Death Coil. This damage accumulates in the<br />
   same way as Ignite and Deep Wounds.<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
-  Enrage: This Bear Form ability now generates 20 rage initially, and<br />
   10 rage over the next 10 seconds. The armor penalty is unchanged.<br />
-  Flight Form: Can now be learned at level 60. Flight speed increased<br />
   to 150%.<br />
-  Flight Form and Swift Flight Form: Now benefit from a paladin’s<br />
   Crusader Aura.<br />
-  Innervate: Duration reduced to 10 seconds, and cooldown reduced to 3<br />
   minutes. This means each use of Innervate will give half as much<br />
   mana as before, but it will be available twice as often.<br />
-  Lifebloom: The final heal that occurs when this spell blooms has<br />
   been reduced by 20% on the base and on the spell power coefficient.<br />
-  Mangle: Ranks 4 and 5 base points reduced by about 11%. Scaling from<br />
   attack power unchanged.<br />
-  Rake: Ranks 6 and 7 base points on initial and periodic damage<br />
   reduced by about 7%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.<br />
-  Rip: Ranks 8 and 9 base points and points per combo point reduced by<br />
   about 6%. Scaling from attack power unchanged.<br />
-  Savage Defense: The animation for gaining this buff will no longer<br />
   make the bear stand upright.<br />
-  Shred: Ranks 8 and 9 base points reduced by about 10%. Scaling from<br />
   attack power unchanged.<br />
-  Swift Flight Form: Druids who have acquired a mount able to go 310%<br />
   flight speed will now also go that speed while in this form.<br />
-  Swipe (Cat): Percent of weapon damage done reduced from 260% to<br />
   250%.<br />
-  Travel Form: Can now be learned at level 16.<br />

-  Mirror Image: Images will no longer trigger the death sound when<br />
   their time expires.<br />
-  Talents<br />
-  Fire<br />
   Empowered Fire: In addition to its existing effects, this talent now<br />
   also grants a 33/67/100% chance to regain 2% of base mana each time<br />
   the Ignite talent deals damage.<br />
-  Frost<br />
   Empowered Frostbolt: Instead of increasing critical strike chance by<br />
   2/4%, this talent now reduces the cast time of Frostbolt by 0.1/0.2<br />
   seconds.<br />
   Permafrost: In addition to its existing effects, this talent now<br />
   also causes the mage’s Chill effects to reduce healing received by<br />

   increased to 50% of attack power, occurring after the taunt effect<br />
   is applied.<br />
-  Judgements: Some of these attacks were considered ranged and some<br />
   melee. They are all now considered melee attacks that can’t be<br />
   dodged, parried or blocked.<br />
-  Judgement of Light: Now heals for 2% of the attacker’s maximum<br />
   health instead of a variable amount based on the spell power and<br />
   attack power of the judging paladin.<br />
-  Lay on Hands: The buff from this ability now reduces the physical<br />
   damage taken by the target by 10/20% instead of increasing the<br />
   target’s armor.<br />
-  Righteous Fury: No longer has a duration, remaining until cancelled<br />
   or death. Also cancelled when a Paladin activates a different talent<br />
   specialization.<br />
-  Sacred Shield: When a paladin casts Flash of Light on a target with<br />

   has 5 copies of the debuff from these seals on his or her target, on<br />
   each swing the paladin will deal 33% weapon damage as Holy, with<br />
   critical strikes dealing double damage. In addition, the<br />

   triggered by auto-attacks and Hammer of the Righteous.<br />
-  Shield of Righteousness: Now deals 100% of shield block value as<br />
   damage instead of 130%. In addition, the benefit from additional<br />
   block value this ability gains is now subject to diminishing<br />

   the player’s level and caps the maximum damage benefit from shield<br />

   indicating a player is within range of the Beacon target is no<br />

   spell instead of 60%.<br />
-  Protection<br />
   Ardent Defender: Redesigned. Any damage that takes the paladin below<br />
   35% health is reduced. This reduction applies only to the portion<br />
   that pushes the paladin below 35% health (example: a paladin at 50%<br />
   health takes a 40% hit; the first 15% hits as normal while the next<br />
   25% is reduced). In addition, once every 2 minutes an attack that<br />
   would have killed the paladin will fail to kill, and instead heal<br />
   the paladin for up to 10/20/30% of maximum health depending on the<br />
   paladin’s defense rating (example: a paladin with defense equal to<br />
   only 5 times his or her level will receive no healing from the<br />
   talent, while a paladin who is immune to critical strikes from boss<br />
   creatures through defense will receive the maximum amount).<br />
-  Guarded by the Light: This talent will no longer cause Divine Plea’s<br />
   duration to be refreshed by using Judgement of Wisdom, Judgement of<br />
   Justice, or Judgement of Light.<br />

   on every swing, and deals substantially less judgement damage.<br />
   Vindication: Redesigned. Now lowers target attack power, is<br />
   consistent and does not stack with Demoralizing Shout.<br />
<br />

-  Prayer of Healing: The percentage of spell power this spell gains in<br />
   healing (per target) has been reduced from 80.7% to 52.6%.<br />

   Toxins.<br />

   rather than the entire aura.<br />

   physical damage taken by the target by 3/7/10% instead ofincreasing<br />
   the target’s armor.<br />
   Healing Way: Redesigned. Rather than providing a chance of<br />
   increasing Healing Wave spells on a friendly target, this talent now<br />
   innately increases the effectiveness of the shaman’s Healing Wave by<br />
   8/16/25%.<br />
   Mana Tide Totem: Totem health now equal to 10% of the shaman’s<br />
