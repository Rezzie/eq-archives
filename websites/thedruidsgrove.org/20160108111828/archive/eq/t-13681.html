 <br />
27-37 i have been in Gunthak, get the mob down to about 20% with the necro, root and FD, while the druid throws dots on and gets all the xp.<br />
 <br />
i know right now Gunthak is the hotspot for lvl 40, and Velks is the hotspot for lvl 45 but i dont want to go there because of fabled.<br />
 <br />
Do you think that she could handle fungus grove in the same fashion as she handled Gunthak?<br />
 <br />
pull with the necro get it down to 20% or less and then handle the mob with Flluf?<br />
 <br />
or do you have any better sugestions<br />
 <br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

Not really the same method of PLing.  The druid could use the lowest level PBAE and back off while you let the mobs beat on the level 70.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It usually stops being good right around 50, but the best part about being 46 is then you can just group up with the necro and have the necro do all the work of slayage while the druid(/whatever) just stands there and soaks.<br />
 <br />
Anyone know what level difference there is in DoN mission-groupings?  I can't remember from the days of LDoNs and iirc, it's slightly different.<br />

 <br />
37-40 stayed in Gunthak (lvl 40 hotspot)  by Temple<br />
pull the shrooms and drogs get them to 20% with pl'r fd<br />
dot,snare watch them die 3-4% xp per kill<br />
 <br />
40-44 so far i have been in Fungus Grove (lvl 50 hotspot), only 2 more lvls till some groupage action and the necro pet will plow thru everything.<br />
pull the bugs and tribe people get to 10-20% with pl'r<br />
dot and run on tribe ppl since they cant be rooted or snared<br />
dot,root,snare the bugs 3-5% xp per kill<br />
 <br />
i got from 41-44 yesterday in about 2 hours, at 46 i will actually be able to use the necro's pet to kill everything, since the necro is 70 he wont get xp as they are all green to him. then will probably move into the shrooms.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I remember hearing spam in Dulak looking for those medallions... Lucky for me, I was usually the only Druid because I had a set group of friend's that I'd hunt with, and I got the medallion first drop. :)</div></div><hr />
