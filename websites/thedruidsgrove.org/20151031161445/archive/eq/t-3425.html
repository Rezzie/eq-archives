<br />
(1)  When equipped, does the 15% duration extension take effect on all &quot;beneficial spells&quot;, e.g., PotG, Cabbage, Girdle, Stalker, SoW, SoE, etc., or only to some?  If just some, which ones benefit and which don't?  Anyone have this listed somewhere?  (I realize it doesn't affect Complete Heal or Invulnerability spells.)<br />
<br />
(2)  Is the 15% bonus guaranteed, or is it just &quot;up to&quot; 15% and varies from cast to cast?<br />
<br />
(3) Does the enhanced effect only take effect when you see the &quot;Your Amulet glows....&quot;  (or whatever the message says), or is that screen message irelevant?  I.e., is the screen message a reliable way of knowing whether the effect was or was not applied to your cast and chosen spell?<br />
<br />
Thanks much for any input.</div></div><hr />

The item will &quot;glow&quot; when it works.<br />

It's fixed additional duration.</div></div><hr />

I can cast PoTC on someone and get the Extended Enhancement effect.  But if I cast PoTG on the group, I don't get the effect.  Same with Regrowth and RoTG.<br />
<br />
Was this done by design?  If so, what is the purpose other than to just tick people off??  I really don't see any other reason to make the group version of the same spell NOT get the effect that the single target version gets.<br />
<br />
Maybe this is a bug, and not an intent?  From all the lists I can find, there is no mention it doesn't affect group spells.  Also, as an FYI, my Obulus Death Shroud (Mana Preservation 3) works on the group spells above.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of /bug'ing this unless someone can point me to something from Verant saying this is &quot;as intended&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />

(3) Yes, the enhanced effect only take effect when you see the &quot;Your Amulet glows....&quot;  As far as I can tell, the screen messages are very reliable, always appearing if the circumstances are correct (correct spell type and level).  The one exception is range focus items have a hiccup when combined with z axis range problems.  In that case, the mobs move past the focus range and into normal range (in which the focus item won't kick in) while you're still getting the old<br />

Your target is out of range!               runaround.<br />
As a matter of fact, I use the focus messages as checks to make sure I'm not still using my CHA (vendor) equipment. :) <br />
