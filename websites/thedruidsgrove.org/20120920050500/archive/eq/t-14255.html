 <br />
Is there a list anywhere that rates Druid AA's overall? <br />
 <br />
What would be great would be a 1-6 rating something like:<br />
 <br />
1 - Worthless<br />
2 - Fair<br />
3 - Good<br />
4 - Excellent<br />
5 - Invaluable<br />
6 - Can't Live Without<br />
 <br />
I'm lvl 68, have 6 aa's (lvl 2 forage) and have been concentrating on leveling and epics. Have my 1.0 and am 2/3rd's the way through 1.5.<br />
 <br />
Very soon I'll concentrate exclusively on AA's. I downloaded the excellent spreadsheet that lists all the Druid AA's, but would love to have a guide that would rate them to help me decide which order to purchase the AA's. I realize opinions will vary but any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />

If you are mainly soloing then you are going to want to maximize your solo killing ability:  dot crits if you root rot, nuke crits if you quad etc.  If you are usually a healer for your groups or raids...then healing aa jump way up the list.  <br />
<br />
     For raiding druids MGB and silent casting are important, for nonraiders they are weak buys.  Would swing from top ratings to bottom ratings for these kind of aa.<br />
<br />
<br />
     To really rate druid aa would require a split rating system.  The aa that any druid should have, such as SCM etc.  The aa that no one should buy until they are running out of aa to buy, such as packrat etc.  And then all the hard ones in the middle that would have to be evaluated for the different roles we druids fill.<br />
<br />
     It could certainly be done, but it would be a fairly complicated process for druids since we do so many different things.<br />

 <br />
Quick damage: it is mostly useful in group situation when you are not the main healer. <br />
Spell casting reinforcement mastery: Steeloak skin costs a lot of mana. Making it last longer is a good thing.<br />
Swift Journey: this gives run5 speed, handy at indoor no-fly zones (the Hole, SG, etc.)</div></div><hr />

As far as I am concerned  the words &quot;GET THIS!!!!&quot;   should be in a 72 point typeface with a flashing red font-- in Bold and double underlined.  Of course if you have 12K manna you would probaly have so much mana you would be  by far the best druid on the  server.  Therefore you probably already have maxed out all y our present AA's  so you would not need help any help with your AA's to be reading this thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quick Damage 5 or 6 <br />
<br />
myself though, because any form of casting haste stabilizes both grouping and solo scenarios. The increase might seem minute but I'm sure many druids can vouch for me when saying the boost is really noticable. <br />
The same goes for Quick Evac which is quite handy when exodus is down and you still need to succor your group out asap but I agree on getting other AAs first. Don't underestimate the power of haste! :)</div></div><hr />
