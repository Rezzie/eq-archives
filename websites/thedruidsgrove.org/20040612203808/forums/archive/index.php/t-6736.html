<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pikaso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
I'm currently a young druid, but i have a 57 necro and was considering farming some elysian gear for myself if possible.  Just wondering if there is a guide to hunting the elysian armor on here, and if a 57 nec could handle the critters with no problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ndainye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Elysians are undead so you should have no problems killing them as a 57 necro, main problem you may have is single pulling them with no harmony.  Best place to pull to is the corner as there are no spawns there and no wanderers that path through.  If you agro kite just make sure there are no druids root doting in your path since we normally don't kite elysians and wouldn't be looking for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pikaso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank ya, gonna go take a look around now.  Hrmm, maybe if i run into a friendly druid i can help kill in exchange for dupes hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Netura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't use harmony once when hunting elysians. They seeinvis, so look for one, and proximity aggro it. Run it to the valley, kite it, loot, repeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go to safe valley.  Invis, SoE (or SoW/lev) and pull from the north side of the valley (wanderers).  Elysians see invis so it's possible to aggro pull them through a crowd of regular mobs.  Just run close to one then back up.  If it's chasing you, run back to safe valley and kite it.  If not, run up again and back up.  Takes a bit to figure out how close you need to be to gain proximity aggro without getting hit (which drops invis which gets you gang raped).</div></div><hr />
