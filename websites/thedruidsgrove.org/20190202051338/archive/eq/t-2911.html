I am sorely tempted to save up 9 AA points for Dire Charm.  I recently started using charm in PoN on the werewolves and I really love it.  I also know that it will help me solo a couple of my epic pieces like the seahorse and barracuda drop.<br />
<br />
However, I am concerned that at 61 and the limitation of animals no higher than level 48, my options for getting my investment back may be too limited.<br />
<br />
I would love to hear the groups thoughts on this subject.<br />

From what I hear, Dire Charm is actually more useful since PoP than before.</div></div><hr />

Well I did a search last night in this forum and could not find anything about Dire Charm and PoP.  I did find a thread that had some good info on CoK and PoP - but CoK works on mobs up to 53 I think while DC stops at 48.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who has info on DC and PoP - please share!</div></div><hr />

As far as Dire Charmed pets in PoP, I think &quot;a young bat&quot; is dire charmable in PoN.  It's a weak MOB comparatively, but what do you expect if it's level is &lt;=46?  It's an uncommon spawn at the raven spawn points.  As I see it, it would be a great DPS addition to a group, but terrible for soloing.<br />
<br />
I also seem to remember rumors of a frog in PoV that could be DC'd, but I don't remember anything more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bizitt</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the PoP zones I've been in so far -- Nightmare, Valor, Storms, HoH, Torment and Tactics -- have DC-able mobs (the DC-ables seem to share a spawn table, so if an animal isn't up, kill till you get one). <br />
<br />
I recently got DC for that reason -- not for soloing, but for added DPS in groups.  I find it to be worth the investment, but only because I bought a bunch of other abilities first and &quot;treated&quot; myself to DC (my self-reward for grinding to Radiant Cure 3, actually).<br />
<br />
That being said, I would advise against getting DC as your FIRST Class ability. Depending on the way you play, others are more useful -- MGB if you're a raiding druid, Exodus and/or Innate Camo for general utility.  PoP abilities such as Spirit of the Wood and Radiant Cure also come in very handy for soloing, grouping AND raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">12-16-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CoD also has druid DC bait. (a scrounging rat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DC is great, but like someone said earlier, I'd advice against it until after you have a few necessities like Exodus and Innate Camo.<br />
<br />
The dc animals in pop are very nice additions to groups. However, they are limited per zone. In PoV for instance there are 3 spawns - 1 for a chanter, 1 for a druid, 1 for a necro. Once those 3 are taken you are sol until that dc person leaves or releases their pet. So, there can only be 3 dc pets in the entire zone and considering all the enchanters with DC you're lucky if you can get one for yourself.<br />
<br />
The other problem with DC pets in PoP is that they're basically located near the zone ins. DC pathing is notoriously buggy, making it almost impossible to take a pet to any real good camp in a zone. You're stuck with killing lower lvl mobs near the zone in unless you want to attempt to walk your pet step by step with risk of trains or having him run back to his spawn point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayne Dethe</div><div class="date">12-17-2002, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problems Seriena mentioned is the reason I still havent gotten DC and I have over 140 AAs.   I'd put it on very low priority as DC pets arent that useable in most zones.   PoV - must compete with enchanters and necros and 3 spawn types only one of which is animal, PoS - I almost never see the green frog up, CoD - only at zone in and pathing is buggy there and XP much better deeper in, HoH - everyone pretty much invises to the XP spots and DC mobs only at zone-in, PoN - difficult to get pet to any real xp spot as the entrance mobs are light blue 64+, PoT - there were green animals at zone in but for some reason werent DC by druid or enchanter (maybe bugged that time?), BoT - only green elementals for enchanters to use plus zone has buggy pathing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klotar AngedeMorts</div><div class="date">12-18-2002, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DC was the first class skill I wanted and got, pre-PoP.  I've gotten my money's worth from it, xp'ing mostly in The Grey at the time and charming the big worms.  I'd also used it in Chardok, Kael, Kedge, etc.  It was very useful and a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Post-PoP, I would now prioritize it lower than I did back then.  Although there are DC'able mobs in PoP zones (not that I have been to many) I don't think I would be using it [as much] and barely am now, except briefly when I was 61/62.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, it's a LOT of fun, pets do serious damage (green young bat in PoN quads 149's if you give it weapons), but I just don't use it much any more except for grins in EW on snow griffs, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abru</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DC is now antiquated imo.  At level 60, a 46 dc pet was on rare occasion a good addition to a group.  At level 65, 46 dc pets are a sad statement, and are only useful where verant has intentionally and specifically left us dc fodder, as mentioned above.  Outside of the contrived circumstance, it's useless.<br />
<br />
There are a whole bunch of upper 40s animals in PoP that would make nice dc pets imo.  If they change dc charm level to (YourLevel - 14), then I'll be excited about dc in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prax</div><div class="date">12-19-2002, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've resisted getting DC since PoP came out for the reasons Abru just stated.  I also came up with a similiar idea to his (LVL-14) that would make DC viable to 65.  <br />
<br />
My idea is simply make it so any animal that /cons light blue can be DC'd (this also solves the problem of not knowing if a mob is too high).  That way,  as the xp range tightens up on us post 60 we get a much stronger pet to compensate.  I know this will likely never happen, but I would get DC in a heartbeat if it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saraahlol</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure how you can say the extra DPS from a DC pet (quadding 149max) is not worth it in PoP. Most PoP encounters rely on serious DPS to get that mob killed fast. DC pet is free extra DPS to add to the group/raid. Makes a nice addition and ya don't need to think of it...just a permanent DOT working for you with no associated aggro. Nice indeed. Also, using DC mobs to aggro kite thing solo has always been fun and makes some mobs soloable that would not be otherwise (e.g., summoning mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prax</div><div class="date">12-20-2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should have included the fact that I'm a &quot;time restricted&quot; type player, and can rarely devote a solid stretch of time or my full attention to a group.  So, as someone who soloes 90% of the time I have a hard time justifying the aaxp expenditure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">L1ndara</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre PoP dire charm for druids was a total waste of points, but with the direable mobs in PoP zones now Dire Charm makes a druid a very worthwhile addition to a group finally.  In a group these pets can add a ton of &quot;free&quot; damage at the cost of having to rebuff savage spirit every so often and watch enrage.  Pretty useless for soloing though if thats all you plan on doing.<br />
 <br />
  PoS the cub is pretty rare so you won't have DC there much, but there are far better things to charm with Command of Tunare anyway that will let you outdamage the entire rest of your party and almost make you feel like an enchanter.<br />
 <br />
  There isn't an animal to dire in BoT unfortunatly.  =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SuburbanLife</div><div class="date">12-21-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love to see Verant step in and add maybe a PoP advancement ability, or maybe one in the class category, that allows you to upgrade your dire charm to higher level critters.  But thats just my idea on how it should work, I liked that one guys post (forget the name though) of being able to DC a mob that is 14 or more levels below you.</div></div><hr />

When PoP first came out, that was where I was going to spend my very first druid points....DC. This was because there were DC mobs available in PoP zones.  However, if there is one mob PER ZONE that is lame and clearly waste of good points and skill.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather use my points toward a skill I would use more often....not spending two hours looking for that elusive mob an enchanter or other druid beat me to.<br />

<br />
If you see yourself staying in the first tier zones for a while then it'll remain useful to you.<br />
<br />
If you will be in Tier 2 zones it might be useful to you, but as mentioned there are only a couple of creatures to charm that can be up at any time. If someone else has them, you can't get one.<br />
<br />
If you are beyond that stage you will almost certainly get no use from the skill.<br />
