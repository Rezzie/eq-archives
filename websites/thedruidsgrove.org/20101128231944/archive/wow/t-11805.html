Love using cat form to take people down so am going for feral druid spec. But I keep seeing people talking about having different sets of armour. What do you mean by this? I have only ever played hunters and paladins before so didn't use different sets of armour. Am I to asume it is speced up stuff depending on what role the druid is playing?<br />
<br />
thanks guys and gals.</div></div><hr />

As bear and cat is dependent on diffrent stats you'll find that some items with more stam, higher armor are good in bear form tanking, while other items with agi,stre to output more dmg.<br />
<br />
Other occasions you may be in a group where you up to a boss has been mostly in catform doing dmg, but the one who've been healing asks you to help out with some heals now and then, for that you would like to have a set with more int, spi +healing and mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
The closer to 60/70 you reach the more you'll find it good to have several sets, I wouldnt worry to much about it before lvl 40. Save what you stumble upon, but dont exhaust yourself trying to get 3 sets pre-40 or even 60, imho. <br />
<br />
I keep 3 sets on me at all times;<br />
<br />
Tank set - high armor, high stamina and agility (+ 415 def at 70) <br />
Cat/dmg set - High strenght, high agility to get high Attack power or/and Crit<br />
Heal set -  High intellect, High spirit and +heal/MP5<br />
Toss them around and you can do all 2 or 3 of these tasks fairly good<br />

Before reaching 35 I'd say you have not that much equipment choices and one set is enough. For later, especially when you reach the endgame, I would recommend (for a feral druid):<br />
<br />
- A tanking set. Go for armor, stamina and defense as well as agi/dodge, but do not forget some AP. This set is to solo some hard hitting mob or if you intend to tank something.<br />
<br />
- A sustained DPS set. Primarily str/ap, agi and +hit. This is for most of your solo play and groups/raids where you DPS.<br />
<br />
- A PvP/burst DPS set. Here you go for lots of agi to get good crit and dodge values. Str is also important but having 10-20% less than with the sustained DPS set is still more than enough. Also try to get lots of sta. In PvP, sta is king. This set is aimed for good survivability (sta/dodge are high) and good burst damage. Use it when doing PvP, when fighting tougher mobs or when you know you will have to switch between bear and cat form during a fight often.<br />
<br />
- A healer set. As feral it is good to go for a huge mana pool - lots of int. With our 20% int bonus 12k with level 70 is not all that difficult. Also go for +heal and mana regen. Why a healer set for a feral? You heal not that well, but in some situations in 5 and 10-mans the group is not lacking DPS, it is lacking healing. That is where you come in. You will not use it often, but it can be the difference between a heroic instance that is cleared and a heroic instance that still has its end boss standing.<br />
<br />
Of course you can make more sets with different resistances, or try focusing on some stats in you tanking sets (one for max health, one for max mitigation, ...). Very often several sets will have the same items in them, but still you will have to carry around at least two bags full of gear, most are carrying more.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
