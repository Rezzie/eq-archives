Six additional ranks will be added to the existing Mastery of the Past lines that will raise the no-fizzle cap to level 70 (ie: level 70 spells and below will never fizzle) Additionally Mastery of the Past has been extended to all classes that did not have it but can cast spells.<br />

I did love it with my chanter and now that she again fizzles her mezzes, it can make CC much more difficult. Still the change was needed. <br />
 <br />
I hate fizzles with my druid. I often fizzle 2-3 times in row, I wish THAT didnt happen. I'm more than happy though that druids get AAs for spells under 70. I can think several spells under level 70 we still use, and it all saves mana. Reptile skin, FoE, Mask of the Wild, Aura of Life, RGC, our snares and roots, Pure Blood, evac and other port spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My cleric alt uses level 70 spells frequently too--specifically, Ancient Hallowed Light (due to lack of level 75 focus effects) and Word of Vivification (same reason, plus there is no level 71+ upgrade anyway).</div></div><hr />

I think I might start using the level 70 ancient heal after I purchase this AA line. Do others plan on doing that? I had good focus effect for healing, so I had been using Pure Life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious since I havent seen anything about that but now show 3/6 trained and the next level is 7 AAs.  I have been maxed on my AAs forever so know it wasnt there before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here, but different reason. Ancient Chloro is the most efficient heal when you have CoA BP. No fizzle will make it even more efficient and reliable.</div></div><hr />
