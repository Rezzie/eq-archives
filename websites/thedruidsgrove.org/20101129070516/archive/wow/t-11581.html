Personally I never have any problems fighting any class except hunters, but I always just get plain owned by them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">02-22-2007, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Don't start the fight in the place they have been standing all the time, you will certainly land in an ice trap. Also avoid places where they feigned death while fighting, there will be ice traps as well. If you are stuck in an ice trap and the hunter runs to shooting distance, shift out while you are trapped and be ready to shift to bear the moment you can. Feral charge next.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Try to get first strike. Start with pounce, follow up with mangle and then either shred and maim or maim directly. <br />
If the hunter is slow and you managed to maim him, go behind wait the time you know the maim will hold and then shred.<br />
If he did use conussive shot run after him, maybe build up some more cp (depending on his damage output, if he does not much damage you have some time) and maim him. Get behind, wait for your energy to build up and mangle+shred. <br />
<br />
<br />
3. If he slows you down all the time, shift to bear and use feral charge. Stay in bear form and beat the crap out of him.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. When you drop below 2,5k health stun and heal (use barkskin so the pet cannot interrupt you).<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Generally ignore the pet. In the time it takes you to shift out, sleep it and shift back the hunter can hit you for several thousand damage. That is more than the pet does in the whole fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. When you have 4-5 CP, you have lots of options: <br />
<br />
- Rip will (if you have around 1,9k AP and mangle debuff) tick 6 times for 500 every two seconds. Add the 1,8k of pounce to that and you'll deal nearly 5k damage, only with bleed-effects.<br />
<br />
- Maim is great against a hunter without pet, because it will deal a fair amount of damage and give you enough time to restealth. After using maim just deselect the hunter and run away, pressing prowl the second you can. Then pounce-mangle-shred him again.<br />
<br />
- Ferocious bite is also an option but since rip scales with AP I rarely use it anymore, because rip deals a reliable 3k damage (if it can tick) using 30 energy, FB deals between 1k and 4k for all my energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Hunter vs. Druid will always be the same game (if both know what they are doing):<br />
<br />
- The hunter tries to get distance between himself and his target so he can shoot. The more distance, the more shots he can squeeze out. He'll use ice traps, frost traps, shots that disorient you or slow you down, or his pet to achieve that. He'll also know that you can afford to shift 4 to 6 times at the most as full feral druid and will try to drain your mana by forcing you to shift often.<br />
<br />
- The druid will try to keep the hunter in close combat, because he will do much more damage than the hunter in hand-to-hand (or hand-to-paw ^^) and he will take away lots of the hunter's options. The druid will use bear stun and pounce stun to have time to hit him as hard as possible (shred with mangle debuff on target), he will use maim stun to regenerate energy, heal or even restealth. He will start the fight in cat form hoping for the first strike (always use pounce, kids), and shift to bear the first time the hunter slows him down, feral charging to cross the distance quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Never forget you are a druid not a rogue or warrior. You can shift out and cast! Never heal while the hunter is not stunned, because he will silence or disorient you. Use MF-spam to finish him if he is running and has only a few hundred health left or a single MF to add another dot. Use cyclone if you have no other stun available at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. Do not run! Running away is exactly what a hunter wants from you. If there is something where you can hide out of his sight for a few seconds you can do that to heal and force him to come for you. If he does not come wait until you are out of combat and restealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
10. In PvP, stamina is king. If you have to sacrifice 200 AP and 2% crit for 1k health, do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
This all is for one on one fights. If there are more people involved most of it will still hold. But ice traps are your friend then. Being stuck in a block of ice will make most others stop attacking you and switch their focus on the others, giving you enough time to leave combat and restealth the moment you can.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that helps you a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">02-22-2007, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Abies pretty much hit it spot on. The real trick to a hunter is to always stay as close to them as you can, and keep an eye out for their traps. The pet can be ignored, but if you manage to root the hunter and then back away a bit, sleep the pet. Two for one.<br />
<br />
Generally, I abuse feral charge, bash, roots, and cyclone. Watch out for scatter shot and silencing shot, particularly. If you can, pounce, but in a duel, and they know you're there, it's useless--go bear from start. In any event, I usually just play it by ear, while staying in their zone. One thing, though; even after they're rooted, and you need to heal, back up a little. They may not be a &quot;melee&quot; class, but they sure can pack a punch at times. I think I got crit'd for 1.2k from melee once, and this was pre-BC.<br />
<br />
Abies' tips will certainly help you win, though.</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree hunters are pretty tough vs druids along with warlocks.  If I get the jump on the hunter with no trap the fight usually goes my way unless he's a scattershot/entrapment spec.<br />
<br />
Pounce<br />
mangle (hope for an ooc)<br />
mangle<br />
maim<br />
wait and shred<br />
shift &amp; moonfire<br />
Bear<br />
finish him off<br />
<br />
Very often bear is not required.  dps FTW :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhroam</div><div class="date">02-22-2007, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunters are quite nasty in PvP.  They were definitely one of my worst enemies (warlocks being the worst).  I haven't done much PvP since the BC because I've been too busy PvEing.<br />
<br />
One trick a good hunter will do to get range is a scatter shot + ice trap combo.  The new ice traps have a 2s arming period.  Scatter Shot will confuse you for 3s.  This will automatically end up with you in an ice trap and them patiently waiting the 3s cast time on an aimed shot.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, of course. I wrote that bit with battlefields, arenas and open pvp in mind. Duels are another thing altogether, because your enemy knows what he is dealing with and has time to prepare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh I know that. I was just saying; I've done duels quite a bit to brush up, and I know others do duels for fun, etc. Just meant in general to not go after them for a pounce if there is a flare or trap up. Which, I've noticed, have a freaking huge range. I wasn't even near one, once, and it went off. :|</div></div><hr />
