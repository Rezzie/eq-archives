<br />
So I just dinged 70 the other day and I’m looking to get ready for Heroics and Raiding.  I’ve looked up the gear lists for Cat DPS and Bear Tanking, and I’m on the hunt.<br />
<br />
Through all of this I’m left with a question, when is enough, enough?  As I understand it Agility is the #1 stat for ferals.  Okay, if that is the case, at what point do I have to much agility?  In the lat few days as I made my push to 70, I noticed I was missing mobs my own level or higher.  More than normal it feels like, but I can’t say that for sure.  So looking at my stat/gear I’m left wondering, have I focused to much on Agility and skipped out on +hit or something else.  I know I need more Stamina, that’s at the top of my list.<br />
<br />
If possible, could my fellow druids give me an idea of what I should shoot for in the way of stats.  Damn if this isn’t more complicated that I thought.<br />

<br />
Def &gt; Stam &gt; ( and others will disagree at where stats prioritize when at this point ) while you are not 415 def w/ 3/3 SotF.<br />
<br />
After you're def capped you need to focus on stam and agi.<br />
<br />
For Cat DPS as I recall most ferals stop collecting hit around 90 or 100 then focus on AP and crit.<br />
<br />
Been a while since I focused on those stats....wow I'm rusty. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my list I’ve got the 415 defense cap, what I’m not sure about is Agility.  I’ve been focused on it for so long I’m not sure were to stop.  I’ve passed up gear with +hit in favor of more agility, but I’m not sure I should.<br />

Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

For your tanking set, check out...<br />

<br />
Regarding stats (for tanking), I'd gem for +sta until you have ~16K in bear form.  Then gem +agi.  Always enchant +agi (or +stats).<br />
<br />
For your kitty set, just use...<br />
<br />
http://www.emmerald.net/  (The Cat-DPS links, not the high-DPS links)<br />
<br />
I use an addon called Pawn that allows you give items values based on their stats.  I take the numbers from Emmerald's list (on the info tab) to create a bear and kitty value for each item.  It helps to compare items in game.  Though sometimes the lists values don't always reflect an item's true value if they have &quot;on use&quot; entries, weird procs, set bonuses, etc.</div></div><hr />

Looks like I missed the boat on this one.  I will add my $0.02 anyway tho..<br />
<br />
The most important thing for you right now is to get a weapon that gives &quot;attack power in feral forms&quot;.<br />
This will increase your damage output drastically.  If I were you, I would focus on this task to the exclusion of all else.<br />
<br />
If you can get a 5 man group together, there is a quest at the arena in north Nagrand which gives a blue reward called Staff of Beasts.<br />
<br />

<br />
Staff of Beasts<br />
Binds when picked up<br />
Two-Hand	Staff<br />
144 - 253 Damage	Speed 3.30<br />
(60.2 damage per second)<br />
+31 Strength<br />
+30 Agility<br />
+45 Stamina<br />
Durability 100 / 100<br />
Equip: Increases attack power by 375 in Cat, Bear, Dire Bear, and Moonkin forms only.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
With regards to Hit Rating.<br />
This only becomes truly important once you are raiding, and most of your gear is of Epic (purple) quality.  At this point Hit Rating becomes a useful way to increase your damage output.<br />
If you get 142 hit rating, your attacks will never miss - even against a raid boss.<br />
142 hit rating = 9% &quot;chance to hit&quot;.<br />
