I'm new to the druids, but have some xp in other fields...still trying to figure this website out. It's almost all QA ...all very interesting....but mostly seems to be geared for the upper echelons! I would like to find assistance but not sure where exactly to look! Right now I'm trying to collect defias gear...hope that's a good move. Don't even know if I should be posting this here! I've never done it before. If u can help me ....it would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

Stop trying to collect specific gear while lvling up.<br />
It will slow u down big times.<br />
Just finish all the quests and get your XP.<br />
Start collecting gear when u reach outlands.</div></div><hr />

Same goes with farming instances for certain gear (except really good pieces that'll last you more than a couple levels)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At first I tried to keep 3 sets of gear around, but it was pointless.  I knew I wasn't going to run instances (until I'm lvl 62) plus pre-BC quest rewards (mostly) suck.  I know once I reach the Outlands the drops and quest rewards will allow to build a couple sets of gear rather quickly.<br />
<br />
I do hang on to a few +sta pieces to use against easy &quot;group&quot; quest mobs.</div></div><hr />

I did, because I was absolutely consumed with reaching 70, and boy, am I paying for it now.  :frown:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">10-18-2007, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other little piece of advice that you probably already know- don't blow through leveling so fast that you don't enjoy the process or the content. My druid was my first 70 (and 60 pre-BC), and I found a ton more neat stuff to enjoy as I leveled my priest to 70 with a friend who was new to WoW. It's not a race, it's about having fun. You're paying to do this for fun, so don't bypass grouping and instances and experiencing content you might find enjoyable just because it isn't the fastest, most efficient way to level.</div></div><hr />

I log on every day to see if something new comes up. The help you guys (general term) give is awesome!!! My post has only been up a short time and I'm getting lots of good info, THANK YOU ALL!!<br />
Of course I'm sure I'll need more help! Let me ask you this...I'm left handed...I primarily use my mouse for eveything...I can't type with my right for anything...how can I compensate?</div></div><hr />

I personnally enjoy instances because I HATE grinding! Slowing it down does make it more enjoyable, I'm still contemplating not worrying about my equipment while lvling!

Thank you SO MUCH for giving more to look at!!!</div></div><hr />

Hopefully, I can figure all that out. How can u keep 3 sets to use at a given time? How do u have the space?</div></div><hr />

Ya'll obviously are into power lvling! I'm from Texas and things are a little slower here....including thoughts! I'm interested in everything....not sure how I feel about power lvling! How can u blow thru the game and NOT worry about armor? U don't run ANY instances?<br />
I understand about doing all the quests, and some grinding (although I hate it!)</div></div><hr />

I'm a lvl 14 Druid and have LW and skinning ( I also cook and fish) I also have a lvl 45 Pally (so I'm not unfamiliar in SOME things!) but I never duel, which in some ways I think puts me at a disadvantage.</div></div><hr />

U will get many quests for all the instances way up to 70.<br />
So go in there for the quest XP and the items will come along themselfes. I just ment dont run instances over and over for an item. <br />
(Friend of mine wanted to collect T0-Set cause he thought it was awesome-&gt; he was about lvl 56 O.o -&gt; i just told him to make 2 lvls and booom ^^)<br />
I enjoy doing instances myself and i love pvp. So i spend most of the time in instances or bg's. And thats very time consuming.<br />
<br />
I agree totally with Avearis. We are paying for the game so i try to enjoy it as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">10-19-2007, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moonfalil, a common misconception is that the game is pretty much finished when you reach level 70.  This is not the case at all, most players will tell you that the game only really begins at 70.<br />
<br />
Collecting the defias set means you will have great gear until about level 30 or so, at this point there will be much better stuff available to you.  If you really enjoy collecting the gear then by all means do so, the reason everyone says to not bother and just get level 70 as fast as possible is because once you're level 70 the gear you obtain won't become obsolete, because you've stopped levelling.<br />
At level 70 most of our efforts focus on obtaining better gear, so there is plenty of this type of thing to come.  With all this said it's your choice of course and you should play the game however you like. :&gt;<br />

It was my misunderstanding! I've read lots of these threads, but have never posted one. I've got a friend who is pretty sharp at the game, but I wanted to learn more from others. (there may be more than 1 angle!)<br />
I am picking up a few things from u guys &amp; gals that I'm giving more thought to! I appreciate all the help everyone is giving! The more input I get, hopefully will make me a better player all the way around!</div></div><hr />

I don't read between the lines very well (apparently!) and it makes me much happier knowing about the armor! With me it's not so much collecting gear, as it is survival and trying to get whatever will help me the longest! With my Pally, seems like I'm always having to buy new stuff! I was hoping the Defias stuff would last for a little longer! Thanks for telling me about lvl 70...that was the impression I had! Now I'll have to get there!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uttercup</div><div class="date">10-22-2007, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">moonfalil.  about playing left handed... here is the set up that i use and it works quite well for me.  use the 2,4,6 and 8 number pad keys for movement (as well as your mouse) then set up your hotkeys on 1,3,7,9 and 5.  I use the / to move to a new target (like the tab key)  the arrow keys to the left of the number keys are for the primary things i do (attacks) these are very easy to find and you will never hit the wrong button.  finally i use the delete (bear) and page down (kitty) keys for my shapeshifts.  Ohh and the zero is to jump, very important key that.  The only drawback to this is that its hard to type (talk) and play at the same time.  makes you seem the large silent type.</div></div><hr />

I was checking that stuff out last night...I like the idea! I've also been looking at that Nostramo N52 gamepad I saw in the forum!

Using it to do what you could do in game is not against the ToS and will not get you banned.  Using it to automate your play ( making water while you afk, keeping you from &quot;afk&quot; in a battle ground, farming, etc ) WILL get you banned.</div></div><hr />

Movement is IJKL (UO for strife), etc.  I have key bindings used in each form to P;'NMY678, etc.  H is set to the same function as  the tab key.  This allows for 95+% of all the functionality I need on my right hand.  Leaving my left hand for the mouse (targeting, camera, some movement, etc.).<br />

This allows you to cast your instant cast abilities whilst on the move (steering with the mouse).<br />
<br />
Many things can be used for key bindings.  Mouse buttons are a good place to put your most commonly used abilities.<br />

Now as new to the forum today .. a leftie  ... and just hit 70 with my druid (which I think is an excellent char for a Welshman such as moi) bags of interesting stuff here.<br />

In particular tlb I'd love to know how to set these macros up please.<br />

I will tell you that after the 2.3 patch is released you will be able to just once click between forms.  So, my double click macros will no longer be needed.  Except to &quot;power shift&quot;.</div></div><hr />
