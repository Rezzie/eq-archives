 <br />
So here I am starting my epic 1.5 quest.  I have read and printed the thread, and have already had trouble (<br />
 <br />
Currently doing the goblin event, and have followed the instructions carefully, or so I think.  I put on my goblin disguise 7pm and say (in goblin) 100, start the contest, and then i get nothing, no server emote, or king saying the contest has started, i waited the entire length of my disguise.<br />
 <br />
Now I'm so sad, I have to go forage for hours it seems, to recreate my disguise.<br />
 <br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

You will know it works if one of the nearby gobbies responds. I remeber spamming &quot;Start the contest&quot; all over the place! I went through three costumes, since the first time I did it to early, and the second time, I failed the event.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Make sure you are not invis.  It still works if the goblins attack you (at least it did with me)<br />
 <br />
Make sure you target the goblin you are talking too (this may not be needed, but it wouldnt hurt)<br />
 <br />
I seem to remember that you have to speak in Goblin, so set your language to goblin, IN ALL YOUR CHAT WINDOWS.  ( i guess you need 100 skill in goblin too)<br />
 <br />
The zone emotes dont happen straight away, I had to wait a min or 2 before the emotes started.  I would also try to get a couple of friends (more trackers would be best) to hang around the zone and help.  Cos this event is a pain......  (i had to do it a couple of times)<br />
 <br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

Several Hiders spawned, so it did take me a bit to find the right one.  I had to laugh at myself, getting alittle over anxious, the first (seeker) i saw, it clicked in my mind aha there he is--next thing I know I had about 25 seekers pounding on me lol.  I killed a few of them and snared and rooted the rest, running away laughing at how dumb I was.  Once composed  I proceeded to track all the Hiders, and found the correct one on the 3rd try.<br />

It's nice having some fun in eq again, I promise not to leave it ever again haha</div></div><hr />
