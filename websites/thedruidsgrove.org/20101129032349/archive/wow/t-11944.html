I probably am not the only one who's just lost quite a bit of motivation to raid at the moment. Thinking of maybe leveling a couple of my alts to 70 to be prepared for WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz wants to bring out an expansion every year and they all will work the same way.<br />
<br />
I'd say: do not raid for items.... collect items in order to raid. Just to see the content, have a fun evening and kill some new bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it will all be underwater and we'll need water mounts.:banghead:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">08-20-2007, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you've seen the previews of the two first zones, it's definitely NOT underwater. That's one thing you shouldn't expect to see in Northrend.<br />
<br />
Not sure about no flying mounts allowed in the first few...Would be a tad difficult to make it so you can't use it in certain zones (especially if you're already flying and happen to zone into it) without having consequences like auto-dismount in midair =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a rumor, YMMV.</div></div><hr />
