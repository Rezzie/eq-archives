<br />
I'm getting a little frustrated at the camera in Bear Form being as low to the ground as it is. I find myself constantly pulling it back just to be able to see, but I don't like pulling my camera too far back as it makes indoors awkward to navigate with my camera constantly flinging itself in and out.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know a way I can raise the height of my camera at all please? Perhaps even tie it into my stance change macro so that it'll raise the camera height on the fly when I switch stances?<br />
<br />
I'm getting a little tired of staring at my own fuzzy butt :P<br />
<br />
Cheers in advance if anyone can help me out,<br />

<br />
When going inside I keep it like that but just adjust on the fly.<br />

Mouse Scroll Wheel is my zoom so I can do it nice and quick.<br />

Doesn't really tell you anything you don't know already, but that's what I do.</div></div><hr />

Don't remember it tho :\<br />

In part.  I use a small mod called ImprovedCamera that allows you to pull the camera back further from your character than normally possible.  I think the actual values mentioned are a normal limit of 30, and a modified limit of 50 or 100.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember a macro to reset that value in-game, but I don't recall what it was or where I saw it.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; found a good resource, includes the link to ImprovedCamera and the command to set it from within the game: http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/10/04/how-to-increase-your-camera-distance/</div></div><hr />

By orders of magnitude I meant 200 or 300 feet instead of 100..<br />

That isn't what &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; means. An order of magnitude is a factor of ten. Two orders of magnitude larger than a base value of 100 is 10,000. Ah wnat too collij.</div></div><hr />
