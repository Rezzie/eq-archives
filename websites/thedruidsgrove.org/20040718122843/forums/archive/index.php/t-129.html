Had that haste cloak and a mana pres 3 mask, and my rogue friend got a decent piercer called the Sting of Betrayal, 15/22 with a 160 dd and a 5% backstab mod.<br />

Looks really cool when equipped!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saffun</div><div class="date">08-27-2003, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Omg i lived in nadox when it came out but never dreamed inny spawned there!!<br />
<br />
Am i to assume it was a script that has been broken since loy came out?<br />
<br />
By the way there is definatly another raid mob in torgrin mines next zone over. There is a script that has always been broken in the upper luggald room. Basically you can spawn a very rare spirit that asks you to choose one of 4 mobs to slay that when killed give you nothing.<br />
<br />
I assume you get a character flag for each of the mobs killed but its way too rare.<br />
<br />
In the lower luggald room under the water tunnels is where i think the real boss mob of legacy of yekesha spawns. The room is obviously designed for a raid due to its size and set-up.  I believe the kraken like monster that is depicted on all the statues and pictures around LOY spawns here.<br />
 It's pretty obvious as you can even see the creature moving around if you look off the lava bridge in torgrin.(try to find it it looks cool!)<br />
<br />
Anyway grats on inny!<br />
<br />
I am not even going to ask you bout details on spawning Innoruk but instead ask you to give any info on completing the torgrin mines script as i think they might have fixed that too.</div></div><hr />
