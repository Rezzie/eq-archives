<br />
I have a mix of laughable gear and some respectable components, and would love some guidance on solo/groupable upgrades (including augs where applicable).<br />
<br />
Any help is extremely appreciated!<br />

These, primarily, have type 7 aug slots, while the more rare versions have a type 3 as well. Most of these items can be bought in the bazaar for very little plat as they are extremely common, even the 2 slot items. The Tier 1 armor drops from various NPC's scattered throughout the SoF expansion, with the exception of Dragonscale Hills. <br />
 <br />
Type 3 augments can be bought from various faction vendors (with appropriate faction), but cost a good bit of plat. Most of these modify the damage and healing of the new spells. As for any other augments, it's pretty much the same as ever....zonewide rare drops, some from particular nameds, etc. If you're really hurting for augs you can solo trash in the hot zones, both old and new, and they will sometimes drops them, though they aren't spectacular.<br />

Edited some spelling errors. :D</div></div><hr />

Confirmed now that they aren't linked. My warrior was able to loot the two Crystallos shields off Tectoran.</div></div><hr />
