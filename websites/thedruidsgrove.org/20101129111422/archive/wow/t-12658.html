I am thorn between a resto druid and holy priest... I do enjoy very mush healing as a druid but as a druid tank I would prefer having a healer that can provide a rez if someone dies during a pull; however if I am tanking on my pally I am more flexible with a druid healer.</div></div><hr />

I've healed as a shaman, druid and priest.<br />
<br />
Personal enjoyment I rate them like this:<br />
Shaman &gt; Priest &gt; Druid</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking of Druid or Pally for the fact that I could swap over to tanking if I needed. That's the only thing people ever want, healers or tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">06-05-2008, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing wise I think pallies are kind of limited.  They're usually at the bottom of the &quot;Healing Done&quot; pile in our raids.  With only two heals, they seem a bit dull.  Shammies seem like loads of fun with chain heal but they're kind of limited too with just having two or three heals all with a cast time.  But shammies get totems!<br />
<br />
Priests seem most flexible having aoe healing (if they get the talent) and a HoT.  <br />
<br />
Druids get to constantly click buttons every 1.5 seconds.  :)<br />
<br />
I see the point about going with a hybrid though although you may find yourself not really wanting to respec all that often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, I have to agree, I've heard very, very good things about Resto Shammies.  <br />
<br />
But that's not to say I'm dissing a Holy Priest, either.  My friend is a Holy Priest, and she is phenominal.<br />
<br />
As for pallies, I think their Armour is quite beneficial for them (being able to sustain a hit better than a clothie), but one has yet to out-heal me on the meters.  I can't say that about my Priest friend - she knocks the heals out of the park.<br />
<br />
But, to answer your question, I guess I would choose a Holy Priest.  <br />
<br />
When a Holy Priest shows up, people usually yell, &quot;Woot!  A Priest!&quot;</div></div><hr />

 <br />
HoT's are just fun.<br />

Edit:  then again, I've always wanted to play a shaman healer...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too, actually ... I'm so jealous of Chain Heal.  :(<br />
<br />
I would never give up healing on my druid though, I think it's incredifun.<br />
<br />
I'd love to try healing on a priest, just because they have so many spells at their disposal I think it'd be really interesting.<br />
<br />
I would never, ever want to heal on a paladin.  It must be the most boring thing ... ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Hots are in high demand for many silences in end game raiding<br />
<br />
2. ToL aura is a huge boost for 25 mans <br />
<br />
3. Innervate<br />
<br />
4. Rebirth<br />
<br />
Thats all i have to say</div></div><hr />

I'm jealous of Circle of Healing.<br />
It eats Chain Heal in Endgame-Raiding.</div></div><hr />
