<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trakaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">looking for some advice on the best exp solo for a well equipped druid twink, trying to get to 42 fast, so i should be able to leech off my 62 beastlord till he gets to a level where they can duo most effectively.  <br />
<br />
Currently at 38 have 1100hps 815ac unbuffed, fungi, and usually have no problems gettin kei,  quadded cougars in IC to 38 but now are light blue, looking to do this solo tho no PL other than twinkage. dungeon bonus exp would be a plus as well, so not necessarily quadding less it truely is the most effective. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quad kite in Eastern Wastes for Ulthorks.  Or you could charm  Dire Drakel Wolf in Great Divide and hunt wolves or Giants (or just quad.. but lots of HP).<br />
<br />
Could also quad kite in The Overthere as well... Cacti and or Chickens...<br />
<br />
Quad kite will probably be your best bet.  Get your WIS to max, and get PoTG/KEI before you start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">twinks suck...hhehehe JK. but its kind of nausiating to me to see a lvl 38 druid with a fungi, when its taken me 2 years to get my stuff i got heheh.<br />
Oh well. Power gamer vs, casual gamer story again i suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Firbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quadding in EW, as has already been suggested, is probably the best bet.<br />
<br />
Quadding Dire Wolves in GD is also very doable (I've been doing this recently with my &quot;baby&quot; Druid, who is 39). I'd stay away from the Giants, though - too many HPs.<br />
<br />
Zelniaks in Dawnshroud also works, but Velious is better XP. Spectres in Oasis are also pretty good XP but they're very hard to quad effectively, mainly due to other players rather than the mobs themselves.<br />
<br />
That's my take on it, at least.<br />

<br />
I went there last night to level up my druid (42).  Haven't quadded them in a couple years and noticed that their lifetap has a much longer range now.  I'm even using a moonstone ring but even at the farthest point where I was able to cast, they were strokin' me with lifetaps.<br />
<br />
These guys been 'enhanced'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ailuvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just in case EW is busy...<br />
<br />
Quad Basilisks in the caves in Jaggedpine.  Loot sucks, but you'll never have to worry about training anyone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went from 38-42 mostly quadding Dire Wolves in Iceclad.  It's rarely camped and has a couple of &quot;safe&quot; icebergs where you can med up between quads.  With a KEI and Kitty Krack you should be able to pull at least 8-10 at a time and the xp should go pretty fast.  Respawns are pretty quick and you shouldn't have any trouble finding plenty to kill.<br />
<br />
They start to go light blue at 42, I believe, but are still pretty good xp until 43, at which point you can group with your BST.<br />

<br />
I don't know, as I've never quadded the ones in OOT. However, I can clearly remember the ones in Oasis lifetapping, fearing and being just plain nasty years ago when I hunted crocs there for XP - but they are melee-only now, it seems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They have definitely been changed some time in the past year.  I quadded Specs in OOT from 45-47 about a year ago and they were MUCH easier at that time (fewer life taps, stayed together in a bunch, seemingly fewer HPs, etc.) than when I came back to farm some Gargoyle Eyes on the isle.  Kinda stinks.<br />
