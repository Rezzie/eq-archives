<br />
I know a few of you have successfully done OS +2/3, and I am hoping I can pick your brain for some advice.  We are pushing into it as a guild now, and I am wondering what strats/positioning you guys use.  Also, should I get special gear for tanking Sarth?  (have a stam set that puts me at about 52k HP / armor capped, no fire resist though)<br />
<br />
For OS+1:<br />
I tank him on the SE corner, a warrior picks up ads (tanks on the SW corner) and we have a Pally tank that handles ads.<br />
<br />
Our Pally struggles sometimes to hold aggro on the whelps + ele's but we have a 4th Pally who recently joined us who is very geared/talented that will be helping.<br />
<br />
Healers: We have 2x Druid, 2x Shammy, a pile of priests, and an occasional Pally or two.<br />
<br />
DPS: We have all buffs covered most nights.  Avg 3k+.  (some in the 4.5k range, one or two in the 2-2.5k range)</div></div><hr />
