<br />
In general, level to 61, do the AA XPing necessary to get those AA skills you deem most helpful for that level (e.g., you can boost Fury of Magic at 61, 63, and 65), then go back to leveling.  <br />
<br />
There's no point in trying to reach 65 too quickly, because at 61 many of the XP giving mobs in the Tier 1 planes will be green or light blue to you.  You can't get to the Tier 2 and 3 planes without completing the events with a group of friends or guildmates.  And when you do get to those planes, you will want your levels AND your good AA skills with you.<br />
<br />
Of course, those with 30 AA points banked are sitting pretty and can just blast up the levels...:)</div></div><hr />

The new spells granted in 61 are decent, but the trade-off of seeing some blue mobs go light-blue/green doesn't seem worth it.<br />
<br />
I suppose it would really depend on what the levels of the mobs you fight are, but I believe most soloing druids would want to pick up the AA points for those first few PoP skills while they're still in 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me ask you this<br />
<br />
I have Run Speed (2) as of now, and about 5 blues from getting Run (3), do you think that I should just AAXP until I get the AA skills that I want and then begin to level to 61-65 and use your plan of switching on and off (which I think is an excellent idea btw)?<br />
<br />
I am just not sure what is greater now Levels or AAxp as seeing it will be hard to come by XP now in my favorite zone Maidens Eye..<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
I would think that since the required exp per aa point is static that at 65 with a group you will be able to make an aa point significantly faster then at 61 with a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am only asking as I am undecided still on jumping over that hump just yet... SCM3, SCF3, Innate/Exodus - I have the ones I really really wanted already, plus a few others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silverbough</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hit 61 today as soon as I logged in.  Since then I charm soloed in ME and grouped with my usual friends in DN.  I saw absolutely no change in exp.  <br />
<br />
Granted, those are not zones where the dreaded greening out is supposed to happen.  But I did have friends who visited low 50 areas and they said the mobs conned about right.  Stuff that was lightblue is now green, stuff that was lowish blue are now light blue.  <br />
<br />
I certainly plan on leveling up, and had already decided to do it basically the way Scirocco described</div></div><hr />

As of yet, I still have no AAs.  :(    I'm thinking that once I get my 61 xp halfway for plenty of buffer, that I'll switch over to full AA until I at least get run3....   Then maybe switch back to full xp again to about halfway into 63.   At which point I'll go full AA for a loooooooooooooooooong time and get caught up on those.   <br />
<br />
Its tough being so far behind the curve....Lost a lot of time by taking a year off. :)</div></div><hr />

Run3 will save your arse a lot.  And SCM 3 is a HUGE mana saver.  I'd get RS 3 and SCM 2 at the very least if I was you.  After that I'd say it just depends on what  you want as to weither you aa or level.<br />

<br />
Suppose you DON'T have all the pre-POP AA skills you want. Should you stay 60 and get them, or go ahead and ding 61? Example, I only have 6 AAs currently. I definitely want SCM and SCF, probably more than any POP AAs. Possibly other pre-POP AAs as well. What should I do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">10-23-2002, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you hunting only in newer lands Scirocco?<br />
<br />
Yes, in the tier 1 planes.  Disease, Justice, and Nightmare are good for a druid soloing.  Innovation has nasty summoning mobs near the zone in, including a randomly spawn pseudo-named.  Although where I hunt may change depending on the crowds.  I hope to get to a tier 2 plane in the next day or two, if enough folks in my guild have gotten PoP.<br />
<br />
I definitely recommend gettting Run 3.  In fact, it was the exception to my earlier recommendation of getting to 60 first, earlier on.<br />
<br />
SCM 3 is the most important skill for a level 60 druid to get.  Along with Exodus and Innate Camo.  If you do nuking or quadding, then get SCF 3.  If you do a lot of healing, then get HA 3.   I wouldn't worry about whether you do this at 60 or 61, since the opportunities to get XP aren't that different in either case.<br />
<br />
At 61, I have purchased Fury 1 (I have SCF 3) and Radiant Cure 1.  The later is a must have, in my opinion.  It cures 9 counters of curse, poison, and disease for a group, and the reuse time is superfast at 3 minutes (people were worrying about 15 min to an hour before).  This makes GRC less of a bottleneck for some SOL encounters.<br />
<br />
Up to 60, I'd say that leveling wins out.  Getting through 60 should be fairly easy (at least it was pre-PoP), so getting to 61 for the vendor-bought Replenishment (25 hp/tick regen) is worthwhile.  But get the above skills at a minimum before going on.<br />
<br />
And yes, filling up the AA XP will be easier at 65 than it is at 60.  Just like filling up the AA XP is substantially easier at 60 than it was at 51.  But getting to the &quot;substantially easier&quot; part requires access to advanced planes, and also the use of some of those lower rank AA skills.  Thus, the bit of switching I mentioned above.  Get the most important skills when you get to that level, then focus on leveling.<br />
<br />
And yes, you should be able to go back and pick up skills at any time.  The level 61 requirement is a minimum level requirement, not a limitation saying you can only get that skill at 61.</div></div><hr />

Is root dot a viable alternative?  Is nightmare a safe place to be? (after bumping into 2 hobgoblins that killed a raid of 18 last night (possibly through bad pathing other unseen ones must have been involved) I am rather afraid.)<br />
<br />
I am at 86% into 60 and have run 2.  No other aaxp to my name, but I do have the eighth shawl and some tradeskills to fall back on (jabs the mob in the eye with the planar sewing needle).</div></div><hr />

I spent 18 of my banked AA last night.  I got Wood, Wraith and Cure.  I guess Cure is broke -- self only atm.  They are all nice.  Wish they casted quicker.  Wraithe is the toy of the three.  Cure and Wood are both really nice, but the recast on wood is slowwww.  I also got Enlightenment and mmmm  Oh, I forget the other name, but it gives me 275 wisdom...which I hope is a nice bump to my mana pool.  No Fury 1 for me.  Soon though.</div></div><hr />

I was there tonight and kept getting adds out of nowhere. Pulled a larva to the zone wall, nothing else around. Then magically a rat appears. I think &quot;hmmm...well might as well try to at least kill the larva and keep the rat out of my hair with root&quot;. Then after re-rooting the larva I get a fly and that's the end of that. Apparently this zone has the same retarded chain-aggro BS that have been introduced to the older zones. I looked around too and there was NOTHING else even close. That's why I thought PoD might be an excellent place to solo because most of the mobs are really spread out. So if there's a secret spot please tell me because I don't see how you can solo here.</div></div><hr />
