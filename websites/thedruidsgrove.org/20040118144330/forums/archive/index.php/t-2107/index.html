<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BrachtEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if some people out there could give me some advice on locations to solo witht the aid of a Manastone.  I am lvl 60 with around 3700m 3khp FT2 MC1.  I just recently got a manastone and play on one of the servers where they never dropped but a  very few were brought in.  Seems like from all I have read the prefered tactic is bind near camp do your thing then port to old world ring, conversion up then gate back.  I am wondering what some of the better and safer camps are to do this at.  I know a few places I have tried have worked well but on the whole there are alot of zones that you cant bind in still.  Any advice would be great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1)  If you have a manastone on a server its never dropped on.  There's a good chance the GM will delete it when he finds it.  So keep it quiet.  There have been two that I know of Deleted on Morell Thule as soon as they hit the bazaar.<br />
<br />
2)  POP Zones won't work well for this.  They have insane regen on the mobs so while your out clicking your mana up the mob will be regenerating like crazy.  Your better off with a lumi-staff and resnaring while your mana regens normally for a big nuke.  The only way this will work is with a partner who keeps aggro while you use the stone.  Two people know then, its not a secret anymore.  See item 1.<br />
<br />
3)  Level 60.  Ding 61 and your exp changes signifigantly.  I solo'd through 60 in the Grey and would do it again for cash/exp.  Can't bind there though =(  You can bind at the vampire castle in tenebrous though which would make an OK cash camp (tough at level 60).  Or in Maidens eye or umbral Plains and quadkite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Manastones only work in old world zones.  And not CT since it was redone last year.  Not sure about Warrens, Stonebrunt, and Jaggedpine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stewwy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I hit 60 with my druid right after Velious came out, thus I was soloing for it.  What I would do is:<br />
bind in Skyfire Mtns.<br />
have a cleric with CH on the second box sitting at my favorite druid ring (lavastorm mtns)<br />
blow mana as fast as I could killing 2-3 mobs in the NE corner of the zone<br />
port to LS Mtns<br />
hit the manastone hard<br />
CH CH CH<br />
full mana<br />
gate back<br />
<br />
rinse, repeat, recycle<br />
<br />
If you don't have someone waiting to heal you when you land in the old world, I wouldn't even bother doing this.</div></div><hr />
