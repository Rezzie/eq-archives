<br />
So I was looking at the new talents, and I LOVE the new &quot;Improved Tranquility&quot; talent! With 2 points in Imp Tranq, that's 60% off the CD timer, which gives it a what? 4min CD instead? &gt;.&gt; I was never any good at maths. &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
However... the only points I think I would be willing to trade to get it are the points i have in &quot;Empowered Touch&quot;. So what would the deciding factor be? I dont use HT very often, in fact I probably use it at the very most, twice in 1 night of raiding. And although I don't use Tranquility all that often either, I generally use it more often then I do HT, as there are a few fights in BT that require us to use it. So im kinda stuck on where to spend those 2 points. &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
With that said, we now have a new talent! It's hawt! It's seksy! And it's called.... FLOURISH!!!<br />
<br />
OMG /Happy dance<br />
<br />
I have always wished that Tranq either had a shorter CD or we had an instant cast AoE heal, and now... now both my dreams have come true ZOMG! ^.^ Well... not quite yet, they will be in the next patch, though. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
I never get into the mechanics of healing, because for me it just ruins the fun of playing a game, plus im an artist, mechanics and maths are alien concepts to me. &lt;.&lt; So what do you guys think this new talent will be like? How will we compare to other healing classes now that we will have Flourish? <br />
<br />
I hear OP druid to no end, will we hear it even more now that we have a 60% reduced CD on Tranq AND a new instant cast AoE HoT spell? &gt;.&gt;<br />

The feral ones sound awesome too  :&gt;  But I think we will be hearing a lot less whining about overpowered druids from now on, spec is going to start being a lot more important as to how well we can fulfill different roles, which was one of the main gripes against us.<br />
<br />
Previously, it's always been a case of Skill &gt; Gear &gt; Spec.  That will still be the case in the expo imho, but the gap between Gear &gt; Spec will have shrunk a great deal; my prediction is that the two are going to start being about as important as each other.<br />
<br />
Even with these new talents, its important to remember that ALL classes are getting new talents - and all of them are awesome.  I really don't imagine many people will be griefing druids in particular over our ones :&gt;<br />

The current Feral tree now has 6 new talent points that are bear only (Mother Bear and Natural Reaction).  This bugs me as I sort of like having a single spec that is a great tank and a good DPS'r.  But, I guess, that makes other tanks QQ too much.  I'm hoping they remove a few more talents so a cat/bear combo is more viable.<br />
<br />
Here's the latest talent tree...<br />

Though Furor is wrong on that tool.  It no longer gives you energy when you shift into cat form.  It just allows you to keep the energy you have acquired while out of cat form.  Plus it buffs moonkin's int.  So, Furor isn't all that great for PvE cats.  It is ok for bears and for leveling cats.  But now it really shines in Feral PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Furor is FANTASTIC for PVE cats.  I've tested it and generally speaking you keep ticking energy up even when out of form.  It won't give you power shifting, but half the time when I swap back I have 100% energy which is just great.</div></div><hr />

I have hunter friend who is just spitting mad that they are taking away &quot;extended traps&quot; (I hope that's right), and a warrior friend who's not all that happy with his changes either. <br />
<br />
However, I'm quite content!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm reserving judgement on Hunters for the time being. Broadly speaking we do appear to be less broken than currently (you will spec 41/20 BM, use a ravager and mash a macro if you want to raid and you will need a spreadsheet to determine whether that bit of gear is better for you or not) but while I'm keeping my eye on the changes I'm not getting too excited/distressed just yet. Except for pet changes, big dance about that, DPS pets, tanky pets, grindy pets, showy off pets and more stable slots that still wont be enough :D<br />
<br />
On paper I like the look of the Resto changes, but I'll admit to still being enough of a sapling that I'm not entirely sure what these changes are likely to mean yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If talants stay as they are i think i will choose this one @ 70<br />
http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=0000000000000000000000000000023003331250150  2000000000000532033100331330010000000000<br />
<br />
and this one @ 80<br />
http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=0000000000000000000000000000023003331250150  2031000000000532033100331330013300000000<br />
<br />
I think this will suit my play style for solo and healing in 5mans + the 3 cool resto glyphs<br />
<br />
Glyph of Rejuvenation<br />
Glyph of Lifebloom<br />
Glyph of Regrowth<br />
<br />
Want to know what you all think about the paths i have chosen</div></div><hr />
