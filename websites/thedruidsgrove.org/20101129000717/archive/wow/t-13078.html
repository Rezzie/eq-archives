What I've seen is that blizzard is leaning toward you'll do &quot;reasonable&quot; dps with a simple DPS rotation and &quot;uber&quot; dps if you're willing to go the extra length and learn the more complex DPS rotations.</div></div><hr />

2. If you have the personality of a hardcore raider then you would probably automatically aim for the best dps rotation. <br />
<br />
Ultimately do whatever makes you happy. I've been switching between Resto/Boomkin since level 62 (stayed resto at 70 for raiding), Being a Boomy is fun but if your raid leader sucks the fun out of it by making it seem like work then just /gquit, i personally have enough &quot;bosses&quot; in my life i hate being reprimanded for low dps by an undersexed/obsessed WoWite.</div></div><hr />

DPS isn't really the reason druids invest in Genesis. I'll just quote this Moonkin discussion over at EJ.com (http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t37048-moonkin_talents_specs_discussion/) --<br />
<br />
Genesis (5)<br />
1% damage increase on MF and IS per talent point.<br />
This appears to be one of our weakest damage talents. Based on Adoriele's calculations here (http://elitistjerks.com/f73/t26204-moonkin_wotlk_talent_preview_discussion/p39/#post914241), it appears you get less than 0.2% DPS per talent point spent. It is very useful to Restoration Druids, however, who mainly use HoTs.<br />
<br />
I personally like it for my hybrid balance/resto spec since I can't go deep enough to get ToL form.<br />
<br />
Things might change however with patch 3.0.8 accg. to MMO-Champion. Genesis will affect Tranquility and Hurricane... and considering 5-mans currently are AOE heavy... might end up being worth more.</div></div><hr />

cause boomkin will be a hot/dot and then kiting class.<br />
just go all out if the opportunity shows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Slaide</div><div class="date">12-17-2008, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It probably depends. ultimately the question really is &quot;could i get more out of those 5 points elsewhere?&quot;, i'm a wrath spammer in PvP so i don't worry too much about the dots</div></div><hr />

You might want to get a mod like &quot;TellMeWhen&quot;.  You can have it pop up a giant Icon when Eclipse procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its an addon specifically for balance druids.  rocks.  hardcore.  you know exactly where you're at with eclipse, and also helps you keep an eye on all your dots<br />
<br />
In my first 25-man naxx as pewpew chicken, there was a another seasoned boomkin in there with me (who didn't use or even know about Squawk and Awe), and I beat him handily on the meters - and I'd say the add-on was a big part of that. I did NOT top the charts overall, nor even come close, but I beat the other chicken dangit!   heheh</div></div><hr />
