<br />
I posted this on the Official WoW Druid Forum and so far I've only had a few views and no suggestions.  Thought I would try here and see how I fare.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
I've been going through the motions of redoing my UI and locating replacement addons and I've ran into a problem that I hope has a simple answer.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that my actionbars don't always &quot;cycle&quot; when I shift into different forms and I can't figure out how to fix it.<br />
<br />
It seems random to me and the only way I can clear it up is to log out then back in. This fixes the issue every time, but the problem reoccurs within the next few shifts (doesn't matter if it's cat or bear.)<br />
<br />
Could this be caused by one of my other addons?<br />
<br />
Please tell me I'm having a newb moment. :)<br />

Yeah I think it is one of my addons causing the trouble.  I am now going thru the process of finding out which one.<br />
<br />
I think I might have also decided to cancel my account for a while...until sometime after BC comes out and most of the bugs are worked out.<br />
<br />
It will take the addon makers a while to rework all of their mods and get them bug free and I just don't like playing with buggy addons...and I hate the default UI...guess I'm just to accustomed to my old Pre Before the Storm UI. :)<br />
<br />
I have found several replacements for a few of the ones I was using, but they are also buggy.  <br />
<br />
Grabbed Metahud to replace Dhud ,which I loved, and metahud worked great for a bit, but the more I played with it the more I noticed problems...not refreshing the mana bar correctly or the Rage and Energy Bars that didn't cycle correctly in and out of forms.<br />
<br />
Loved using GroupButtons and I hear they are working on fixing them, but no idea on an eta.<br />
<br />
And the one I loved the most Complete Druid (Feral Fighter) is dead and buried (old modder isn't updating it) and I'm not even certain it can be fixed with the new macro system.  I can play my druid without the automating of certain attacks that CompleteDruid offered, but being a soloer and having the play-style I have, it was great help and I'll miss it the most...If someone gets it to work with BC and adds the Mangle function into it with a GUI similar to the old one, drop me a line and I'd probably donate for the effort :)<br />
<br />
I think I'm just depressed they broke most of my UI and I just don't have the motivation to keep looking for updated fixes.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll take a few weeks off and see if CompleteDruid, Groupbuttons, and a new HUD are out there when I come back...if they are then maybe I'll be ok :) <br />
<br />
Sorry for the rambling post that went way off track and thanks for the help with the original post.<br />

<br />
On a sidenote, I switched to Ace addons a while ago, and I don't regret it now; it seems most Ace-based addons have been corrected very quickly; those I rely on are already fixed. My guess is that this is because there's less own code in these that the makers need to take care of once Ace itself has been corrected. Compare that to having to do a total code review...</div></div><hr />
