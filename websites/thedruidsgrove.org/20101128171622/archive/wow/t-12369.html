<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dogma</div><div class="date">01-31-2008, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I have 70's of every class except Druid and oddly enough, I think Druid may turn out to be my favorite because of the versatility. <br />
<br />
Some of my highest level characters have been killed by Feral and most recently by a Resto druid. <br />
<br />
Now, I DO know alot about other classes but NO feel for how powerful a druid is. I don't know for sure if Druids have beaten me due to the skill of the player, the gear over mine or due to the class itself.<br />
<br />
I am curious though, against other classes as a whole 1x1, what spec is generally considered the most powerful among your peers? I would have sworn that Feral was until the other day when a Resto druid took 20k of my dmg like it was nothing. <br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your feedback,<br />

Warlocks being my easiest calss to deal with while shadow priest and hunters my hardest. So I think you should have gotta druid to 70 a LONGGGG time ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, frost mage vs feral druid is heavily stacked against the feral druid.<br />
Feral druid vs rogue is heavily stacked against the rogue.<br />
Rogue vs boomkin would usually see the rogue winning.<br />
And warlocks generally eat restoration druids for breakfast.<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer your original question, imho resto is considered the best spec for group pvp, but in a 1v1 situation feral druid is the stronger spec.<br />

I don't have natural shapeshifter; if I did, I might have an easier time with frost mages.  Fire mages I can rip to strips without problems.<br />
<br />
I figured resto druids would struggle with warlocks because the lock can drain life on the druid to recover from the moonfire/wrath damage.  How does a typical resto druid vs warlock fight pan out for you Archiee?<br />

If they would drain mana more then we would be in a tighter situation, my HoTs keep me up through their DoTs and fear spam.<br />
<br />
Edit, its my moonfire and insects that bring them down. But it takes awile trust me. But they go OOM before I do. The real geared ones make me use innervate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valkry</div><div class="date">02-06-2008, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any smart lock would do two dots, fear and spam mana drain, its &gt; 1k mana each time. They dont really have to worry about the dmg too much, as wrath&amp;moonfire by my 60 point resto druid is nothing too worry about. SP's also pwn resto druids because of mana burn and we have to heal ourselves a lot to cover the dot dmg.<br />
<br />
But then again, i find it easier against hunters as they cant heal so moonfire just burns them down (i should respec to insect swarm maybe for that extra dmg) and just travel form to get rid of wingclip and stop them do much steady shots/aimed shots.<br />
<br />
But no class can stop us from escaping in world pvp or in bg's lol</div></div><hr />
