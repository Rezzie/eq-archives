Curious if anyone has found success with offbeat strategies (i.e. have heard tell of a strange kiting strategy - some people kite the drakes while the rest of the raid downs Sarth).

If you do it with 3 on either, you get a title... I'm not really concerned about the the title, but the bonus loot is hot. I want that helm that drops in 25-man with 3 up for my kitty dps.</div></div><hr />

Check out the new video at TankSpot.com, some pretty cool ideas there. Five tanks FTW!<br />
<br />
We just did one drake 10 man on Thursday and one drake 25 man on Friday, going for 2 drakes on 10 man next week. A really fun challenge if your doing it with a group you feel you can rely on.</div></div><hr />

We are whiping our way through it right now.<br />
The flame-debuff is just too much for us right now.<br />
<br />
We try to take 1 drake down, before the 2nd one arrives. (using all cooldowns we have).<br />
We have him mostly on 15% when the 2nd one comes in and than all ppl go crazy and dying in void zones and flame-walls.<br />
<br />
There is a long way to go until we down him!<br />
<br />
Another big prob is the tank of sartharion. <br />
I'm at 52k hp when i tank sartharion with 2 adds and i survive sartharions breath only if barkskin and SI is running.<br />
For the next breathes i need a paladin shielding me or a priest using his 51 talent to keep me up.<br />
I know a DK-Tank would be better but we dont have one.^^<br />
<br />
At least we have him with 2 drakes on easy-farm! ;-D</div></div><hr />

You definatley need everyone in the group to be comfortable with the waves before even considering a drake up though.  Really, once the DPS knows &quot;the dance&quot; so to speak, its just a matter of tanks surviving all the ads.  <br />
<br />
I definatley reccomend 3-4 tanks for 25 man when you are starting with a drake, just to keep the whelps out of the healers hair.  <br />
<br />
For 10 man, they don't hit at all.  We have a DPS DK, pop frost stance and manage the whelps just long enough to drag them into the Pally tanks conc. (Pally tank on the drake FTW)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">02-09-2009, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got 3 drake this week. assuming ur reading up i'll speak of a couple specific tips. unless they changed it tankspot recommended tanking him in the middle... don't tank him in the bottom left corner facing from the door. i've heard it can be done with 3 tanks, but we used 4. MT-sarth, 1 off tank picks up all 3 drake. other 2 on adds<br />
<br />
special notes:<br />
<br />
drake tank will pick up the 1st and second tank. but for us when the act of moving the drakes to the next location killed our dps too much and was too dangerous for our dps. So we had one of our add tanks pick up the 3rd drake and bring him to the drake tank who's still at the drake number 2 position. <br />
<br />
don't take 1st 2 portals because drake dps is more important. 3rd portal needs to be taken to get rid of that debuff on the dps. (2nd drake should be down by now).<br />
<br />
if you buy the fire protection pots for the MT. they can replace serve as an added CD to your CD rotation. <br />
<br />
make sure you have atleast 4 healers be priest or paladins to serve as your CD rotation<br />
<br />
CD rotation should start as soon as the 3rd drake lands, start calling it out on vent, 4 healers, barkskin, SI/ fire pot should get your thru 6 maybe 7 breaths. once 2nd drake is down its a cake walk. <br />
<br />
download &quot;failbot&quot; i think its called. it calls out and tracks how many times each member of your raid fails to lava walls/ void zones. <br />
<br />
make sure rogues and hunters De enrage adds &gt; dpsing. they'll have to be reminded since they are more about recount. <br />
<br />
for the healer that is healing MT. stand either on the &quot;top/bottom&quot; lava position. or on the island (during middle lava wall). cross sartharion where his legs are but don't try to case much here because his stun will screw you up. <br />
<br />
in the beginning dps like to blow all their CDs on that 20 second dps sarth period before drakes land. this is dumb, save cds for 1st drake and 2nd drake. preferably be able to kill 1st drake quick without heroism so you can heroism on 2nd drake.</div></div><hr />

Great tips Goose, thanks. I expect we will succeed at 2 drakes 10 man this week and then start on 3. I hope to have a DK tank geared up by then, otherwise I'll be tanking Sarth.<br />
<br />
S3rge, are you stacking fire resist for the fight? I've got my stam set ready but I know Kalon recommends stacking FR.<br />
<br />
Goose, I think DBM does this? I've never downloaded Failbot, but I still get those messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">02-09-2009, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've heard DBMz might have this option, but honestly even though our GM uses failbot, we were actually arguing in gchat which he uses... :P. <br />
<br />
on our server, of the guilds that suceeded, 2 use feral tanks on sarth, 1 used a DK, and the 4th MT is unknown to me. I also recommend for tanks to use dragonfin filets (40 agil + 40stam food).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never considered Fire-Resist.<br />
@Goose: Should i go for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">02-14-2009, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i did it without fire resist gear. seems like a worthy theory to try though. <br />
<br />
I do however recommend might fire protection pots. u pop them right before one of the heavy breaths, and it absorbs like 4-5k fire. not bad.<br />
<br />
Another tip: when 3d drake lands make sure ur not attacking or autoattacking. in addition to parry issues, theres a debuff incoming that returns damage whenever you attack. its not huge, but if you maul'maungle right before a breath. you could be loosing like 6khp or so</div></div><hr />
