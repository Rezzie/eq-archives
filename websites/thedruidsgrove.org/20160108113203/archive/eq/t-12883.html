 <br />
Blackburrow is a nice spot also as it's considered an outdoor zone and there are tons of mobs. It's also close to a book and surefall glade where your spells and trainers are.<br />

Though, I'm not sure if you are high or low enough for that area.<br />

At lvl 12 I was hanging out at Oasis, or the derv camps in Nro I believe. :)</div></div><hr />

Now to learn how to be a druid at level 23 (use to be 24) you get your Charm Animals spell and go to Great Divide.  Charm a wolf and go kill yourself some Tizmak's.  This may be a decent way to make some coin these days since you can break down the velium weapons into velium blocks.</div></div><hr />

It on the far end of the bonepit which looks a bit like a stadium bowl with mobs inside.</div></div><hr />

Find and use the Cabilis Stone / book.<br />
Which will take you to THE FIELD OF BONE.<br />
<br />
Map found here.<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/fieldofbonemap.html<br />
Book is at about the letter K on the bottom of the map.<br />
<br />
Go north until you run into the edge of the Pit.<br />
Skirt around the pit keeping it to your right.<br />
Keep going aound the pit until you see a Tall building<br />
with a ramp goin up the side.  Go up the ramp and<br />
at the top you will zone into Kurn's Tower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paludal Caverns from PoK.<br />
Find and use the Nexas Stone / book.<br />
Go East up and across the middle until you get to the other side.<br />
This will take you to Shadow Haven.<br />
<br />
Map found here.<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/shadowhavenmap.html<br />
You will zone on the little circle between 20 and 22.<br />
<br />
You will go east. (stay out of the pool)<br />
Up 2 sets of stairs. (by #31 on map)<br />
Go south / east through the garden and under neath the bar. (#9)<br />
You should run into an old wooden bridge going south.<br />
Now don't worry you will not fall in between the boards on the bridge.<br />
Keep going around the 2 bend and that should put you into PALUDAL CAVERNS.</div></div><hr />
