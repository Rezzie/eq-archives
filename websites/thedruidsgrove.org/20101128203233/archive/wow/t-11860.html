<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowlady</div><div class="date">07-02-2007, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a level 70 druid on dragonblight. My question was: what gear/stat requirements should be expected for Kara raids. As in for a balance druid or feral druid. My druid currently is full resto and has 1k to healing but only 9k mana. Is this enough? I have only played my druid feral once along time ago so wouldn't even know what their requirements should be. Can anyone help me out on this. Thank you in advance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are JUST starting out feral here goes.<br />
<br />
Feral:<br />
16k+ Armor <br />
10k HP in bear<br />
3/3 Survival of the fittest<br />
415 Defense ( or combo of Def &amp; Resilience to be crit immune )<br />
20%+ dodge<br />
<br />
Resto:<br />
9k mana can be fine depending on how far resto you spec.  You'll want about 1k + healing and I loved to stack mp5.  If you go full blown tree, stacking spirit is good too, but you need quite a bit for it to really make an impact on your +healing.</div></div><hr />

Are these unbuff stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">07-10-2007, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally yes.  I have currently something like the following unbuffed:<br />
<br />
22k armor<br />
14k Hp<br />
3/3 Survival of the Fittest<br />
410 def (+30 Resilience)<br />
20% dodge (up to 34% with my Moroes Pocket Watch WOOT)<br />
<br />
Its not as hard as it sounds.  The best place to start is with the Clefthide set. That is one of the best starter sets for getting where you want to go.  Then slot in the blue gems and you are good to go.</div></div><hr />
