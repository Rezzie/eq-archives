<br />
i'm mostly excited about the badge changes so i can begin to work towards new gear from conquest badges....<br />
<br />

<br />
laggy in Dal but other than that not a badge patch - better than recent Blizz patch day efforts.<br />
<br />
lots of people trying it on with new epic gems prices. i saw one gem on the AH and the BO price went from 100g - 800g ! lol !!!<br />
<br />
i may buy a few later with EoH and try to make a few hundred gold.<br />
<br />
am really waiting to actually see the new gem recipes so i know how good they are compared to the current ones.<br />
<br />
our guildie DK tank is not happy with the changes and already said tanking is not fun etc now and he will put the effort into his pally to gear up as a tank instead.<br />
<br />
i've not seen anything to alter my oomkin so it was a fairly non patch even for me although i've not healed anything yet.....<br />
<br />
i like the new Sunreaver Flying Dragonhawk for 150 seals, someone had one and it looked awesome.<br />
<br />
They have changed a lot of the tourny dailies which i think surprised people, certainly the pug grp i was in doing the Citadel quest which is now only 3 Commanders and nothing else.<br />
<br />
oh and our kitty druid hopefully turning tank was very happy with her new kitty and bear forms after visiting a barbers !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">08-06-2009, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we had issues on Crushridge US Tuesday night after the patch. we went into ToC, then did heroic ToC, and then couldn't leave the instance... couldn't hearth or leave through the exit. We disbanded, and the timer to transport us out for not being in a gorup just kept resetting. We also couldn't log out, and when i opened a ticket, it didn't even register on my UI that a ticket had been opened. It was VERY frustrating. I ended up just closing out WoW, turning off my rig, and going to bed.<br />
<br />
as far as the new forms go, Im very happy with how my kitteh looks. not so much about my bear. It's funny... when i looked at the pictures posted by Blizz i was totally loving bear form, and kitty was kinda 'meh' to me... well, the pictures just didn't do kitties justice, and bears look like they have sharp jaws and bigger fuzzier butts than what was posted. I'm the black kitty (on the top right of the 6) and greyish bear (bottom left).<br />
<br />
The nerf didn't hurt me as badly as i thought it would, either... I'm still topping the charts :)</div></div><hr />
