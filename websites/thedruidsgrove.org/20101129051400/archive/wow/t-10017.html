<br />
 Ok let me run this down.<br />
 Last night a group from my guild were in DM, myself included, farming Living Essence when suddenly comes the yell from the arena that tells us the rare(?) spawn is now up so we make our way there.<br />
<br />
 We jump down into the arena and start the fight, and soon there after a group of horde jump in to try and mess us up.<br />
We were able to kill the horde with only one death and keep on truckin, that is until a group of alliance jump down and attack us killing us all.<br />
<br />
 Now, I understand that in the arena its a free for all and anyone can attack anyone no matter which side you are on but i was very surprised by it, like the rest of my group. I would never do it and would have never expected it up to now.<br />
<br />
 Just curious as to what you guys think?<br />
<br />
 It made us mad enough that once ressed we stayed in the arena and did nothing but kill the other alliance group while the horde group killed the mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horde messing with Alliance is expected.  <br />
<br />
Alliance messing with Alliance or Horde messing with Horde?  No way.  If you mess with me though I'll mess you up.  :D</div></div><hr />

You are not in the BGs, you are in an arena where you are fighting for some craptastic loot in a chest. FFA, anything goes. You want the loot, you better be able to take on all comers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">02-13-2006, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree with Falloraan. Arenas aren't instances. The whole idea is that everyone can attack everyone. If you don't like that simply don't go there. There are plenty of instances where you can PvE in peace. :)</div></div><hr />

We are entirely made of RL friends, and we have a guild in both factions, &lt;Rocks!&gt; on horde and &lt;Rocks Too!&gt; on Alliance.<br />
<br />
Well there are only like 8 of us and we decided to just bring whatever 60s we had so there were some from each faction (we coordinate over Yahoo! Messenger w/ Voice), and a couple of guys had 60s on both and brought them both down so when one died they could switch over rather than run from the Graveyard.<br />
<br />
It was a lot of fun, but I noticed on the Allied chat that a lot of people were whining about a cross-faction guild.  Afterward they were even complaining about getting attacked by our Alliance members.  I just don't get it.<br />
<br />
Why on Earth would there be any faction loyalty in an arena?  Do I really care who wins, assuming I lose?  I think it must come from some kind of insecurity.  It must make people feel like they aren't so utterly and totally alone.<br />
<br />
I just don't get the whole, &quot;at least an Alliance member got it&quot; mentality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">02-14-2006, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm. It has nothing to do with being insecure. I guess there are just to many poor sap's like myself that take their loyalty to seriously within this silly game.<br />
<br />
 I know its the arena. I know its a free for all. I just wouldnt do that to an ally. Now with that being said I will never take it for granted that other folks think the same way because it will surely get me killed again hehe.</div></div><hr />

Ive never participated but i remember reading about a group that invited a warrior and a druid I think to join and promised to roll on what ever loot was obtained.  As soon as the group won the fight the original member (the ones that invited the Warrior and Druid) killed them and took the loot for themselves.<br />
<br />
very mercenary business.<br />

We just checked the arena out of habit and there was the Chimera mob. We jumped in and started fighting it, when all of the sudden, another group of alliance jumps in and starts harrasing us. We took it in stride keeping our people up, thiers down and continued tanking the mob. When all was said and done, we got the mob and then the other group sent us some tells asking what dropped.  It was all in good fun.</div></div><hr />

I don't think something like that would be acceptable on a RP server though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The arena is great fun!<br />
<br />
Not long ago when I was at a (warcraft) party, we had 3 computers all set up in the same room.  It was late at night and we got a bunch of guildies to come down to the Arena.  I invited everyone to a raid and then we had some awesome team battles...  the biggest was a 5v5v5.  Everyone heads into a corner of the arena with their group, then they get a few minutes planning time... I'd do a countdown then yell GO! and then everyone tries to pillage each other.  We had a priest standing off to one side to res people who died, and 2 lvl 60 Shamans appeared (played by people on the other 2 computers in the room I was in), and they agreed to be &quot;bodyguards&quot;, killing anyone who tried to interfere during the battle.<br />
<br />
We did get a few people arriving, who decided to join in.. after the shamans had disposed of them, I invited them to the raid and included them in the next battle.  It was really awesome, there was a lot of frenzied shouting in the room I was in, hehe..<br />
<br />
Also, sometimes I go to the arena without having any interest in the contents of the chest - I go there simply for the pvp aspect of it.  Sometimes people see me waiting there and I'll get whispers from lower level players asking if I need the chest, or if they can group with me and take it if we win.  I always say yes, on the condition that they leave at least 1 item in the chest so it doesn't disappear.<br />
<br />
My advice to anyone who is looking to get the chest is to go there 20 minutes early, find the toughest looking player, and whisper them to ask if they need the chest..  if you are polite, and they don't need it, you may well get invited to their group and wind up with one or more extremely powerful allies.. :)<br />
