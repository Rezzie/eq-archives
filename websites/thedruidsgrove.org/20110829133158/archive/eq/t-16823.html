<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">09-12-2008, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi all!  I thought I'd share my experience last night which made me so happy.  :rolling: <br />
<br />
Last night I got some help to find the ground spawn base containers for the Crystallos key.  The first two went pretty easy.  The one in HoS wasn't hard when we finally joined another group who had a cleric.  It turns out the invis vs. undea &quot;Fool the Fallen&quot; can stack with Druid camo!  So wam - got invis vs. undead and the living!  :thumbup: <br />
<br />
Then it was off to MMM to retrieve the 4th and final base.  I had a heck of a time finding that Steamfont entry in Fortress Mechanotus.  It wasn't marked on my map but is now!  So I zoned into SF and proceeded to MMM without incident.  However the zone in to MMM was a different story.  There was some cleric / druid box that was attempting something near zone line and they attracted the attention of the biodisposal mass more than once.  That mob is a pita cause he basically camps the first room and sees invis.  :nono: <br />
<br />
I thought to myself... this is a good time for 2nd life!  For weeks now I have been doing my best to keep 2nd life on me when doing dangerous stuff (like grouping with my gimp war friend).  And for maybe 10 deaths with having the buff on, I didn't get one proc.  So it was really bumming me out.  :banghead_ <br />
<br />
Anyway - after several attempts to negotiate the first room in MMM, I began to grow more patient and waited for the ooze to path to one side.  When it did that, I gained entry to the next hallway.  I did have a /loc for the base ground spawn, but wasn't sure which room it was in.  NP - I found it OK.  However there was a sick combo of live and undead mobs in the room as expected.  After much contemplation, I decided to make a run for it since I saw where the ground spawn was from the door way.  But within seconds of my run, I had a train on me and just grinned expecting the death to be quick and painful.  :grin: <br />
<br />
Well - guess what??  For the very first time in this Druid's life.. Second Life proc'd!  I was getting the innvulnerable messages and eventually realized what had happened.  I thought to myself.. wow - I must be safe for a few seconds.  So I quickly looted the Light Blue Crystal Base and placed it in my inventory.  :dance: <br />
<br />
Of course, I didn't know what to expect and my exodus didn't work when I kept hitting the key.  So I thought I'd mem gate and see if that would work.  Well, by the time I had it up my 2nd life wore off and I immediately received a free ride to bind.  :burn: <br />
<br />
Next time I'll know to look at the 2nd life timer and hit my Exodus button when it wears off!  :wiggle: <br />
<br />
Happy Friday everyone!  Have yourselves a good weekend.  I know I will.  :buttrock:</div></div><hr />

go to your home town and get the second chance tribute and max it.  Used it myself along with the second life buff. I'm the last to die on all raids when using these two together when most all other groups wipes. Also this may help when doign crazzy things, hit sotw and have reptiles buff on you. Reptiles will allow you the a few extra hits from mobs to make runs while sotw will heal you. In most zones where you make death runs in,  the ds is not enuff to effect the mobs enuff to make them start to summon, so dont fear that.<br />
<br />
as for geting the heck out when your in trouble, and 2nd life has proced, run and make shure your exodus is up, now drop the da buff that will be in what i call the bard buff window, aka the short turm buff window, as ya kick that off hit your exodus.<br />
<br />
kind of freeky to have 2 life procs active at the same time for the first time, i rember when both mine proced at the same time, i think i said it then had to go chage my shorts lol .</div></div><hr />

If so, you may want to bring a friend to proc it for you, so you could make use of delay death if it fails to proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although it took me two attempts to succeed, trying to proc Second Life or anything else complex seems excessive to me.</div></div><hr />
