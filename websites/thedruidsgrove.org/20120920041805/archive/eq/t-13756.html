 <br />
I swear this is what is going on with me and a couple druid friends of mine. People we group with a lot ask for Pot9 or soe, and so we all will cast it. My buffs last 20% and 25% longer than my other two druid friends, but they are both 1 level ahead of me (I'm better geared with more AAs). Their buffs always seem to overwrite mine, but mine are blocked by theirs'. This is extremely irritating at times, like refreshing a buff only to have it blocked, getting the person to click if off, and casting it again, or casting soe before we go to indoor zones like Droga. Half of us will have soe wear off much sooner, and since we usually run around a lot those without soe get left behind. The result is we have to zone out early, cast *my* soe (at this point they know if they don't let me cast soe they get their little bears shoved into places they really don't want him), and run back to our camps. I was just wondering if this is actually what is happening or if I am just crazy. Does anyone know?</div></div><hr />

It used to annoy me to, so I got lvl70 and naa naa to the others :)</div></div><hr />

2 level 70 druids, call them A and B.<br />
&quot;A&quot; is ubar max supah treehugger with absolutely max duration from both AA and focus item.<br />
&quot;B&quot; is gimpass, slacking dirtgroveler, no duration extension whatsoever, no AA's, no focus gear.<br />
<br />
Recipent01 says, 'Could I get Steeloak Skin please?'<br />
<br />
&quot;A&quot;, being the ubar max treehugger he is, ofcourse got all kinds of spell haste (from Blessing of Devotion his/her equally uber cleric friend cast on him, and Beneficial Spell Haste focus item etc. etc.) casts Steeloak Skin on Recipient01. Hurray, we all rejoice because now Recipient01 got Steeloak Skin for a loong long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;B&quot; wanting to be nice, also casts Steeloak Skin on Recipient01, &quot;B&quot; however didn't see that &quot;A&quot; already cast the buff (and is slower at casting etc. etc.) hits Recipient01 with Steeloak Skin after &quot;A&quot;, thereby overwriting it with a lower duration.<br />

Why oh why?<br />

I've never noticed my buffs being replaced with lower duration ones, ever. I guess it's possible buy I check the duration very often and never noticed that.</div></div><hr />

Because it would be more work to program the server to not only check the level of the caster (as it currently does) but to check the timer on the buff you have and then figure out which would be longer.<br />
<br />
We have to understand that every time they touch the code, something has a good chance (like 99.99%) of going wrong.  To overhaul the code to check buff timers means that for days (or even weeks) buffing is going to be bugged, somehow.<br />
<br />
While I agree it would be nice, at this point, I just want group and single steeloak and group and single soe to overwrite each other and for cleric spell haste to overwrite each other (Blessing of Devotion and Aura of Devotion).  Anything more complex then that strikes fear in my heart that the game will be bugged for weeks (or months).</div></div><hr />

This was about a year ago so not sure if this is still the case. And yes lower durration buffs can over ride same spell higher durration casted by the same lvl dru. <br />
