ldon has more hp/mana if you've been doing lots of them.<br />
otherwise this slipgear aug is a gimmie and real nice!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
A MONTH?!  You must be an LDON god if you can pull off 366 wins in a month.  I spent the better part of a year in those damn things getting that thing maxed.<br />
 <br />
There are a number of DoN charms that offer multiple slots, so all is not lost, since you can stick your DoD and LDON augs in one. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lhittle</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, as Logilitie said...if someone has done enough ldons to have 100/100 on it ..this charm augment is not worth it. However, if you have less than 50/50 this is a very fast charm to get, you can always keep the ldon charm in your bank and if you are feeling crazy enough to quest and do missions to get it to 100/100 you can. <br />
<br />
Also, all of this can be soloed if you are careful, the ruins and the hive can be difficult, so you may want to expect to die and summon a couple of times. I found in the ruins that I could lev up the wall to the left side of the arena and get in from there to get two of the locations done. Make sure to con every mob in there because some may see invis. Also, be prepared to use exodus if you have it. <br />
<br />
Good luck, it is a very nice charm augment.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
mines is still at gimp 1 run's worth's stats and ive tried everything from re-auging the augment to smashing it with a hammer.  So much for the &quot;slipgear gem fixed&quot; patch...<br />
 <br />
perhaps it is because it is pre-patch =/</div></div><hr />

But you have to put it on a charm then equip the charm and then zone.  Seemed to work for me.  Haven't had a problem with it since.  When I take the charm off and put it in my inventory, my gem doesn't show any stats.  I just re-equip it and the stats come back.</div></div><hr />

There is no reason to go there I can think of now.<br />
I already have 10k points wasting away. <br />
I just wanted wins before for better aug stats. <br />
GL finding a group to go there now ha-ha ( like it wasn't hard enough already )<br />
<br />
The only reason i could see anyone going was they had &gt; 50 hp/mana aug and wanted to get more? <br />
And that's a stretch since it takes sooo long to get an increase with it.<br />
<br />
Nice way to extinct an expansion <br />

<br />

I also wondered if I still had to carry the LDoN augment.<br />
<br />
I have tested and found that you do not have to carry it to be teleported by the Magus'.<br />
<br />
No idea if you need it to get missions.<br />
<br />
I also have not destroyed it but banked it instead.  Since, in theory, if you destroy it and need it again, you can just ask an NPC for another, I (or someone) should destroy it and test that out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He isnt time flagged so this combo works better for him, if he had his time flag he says it wouldnt be better than the pop charm plus his ldon aug.<br />
