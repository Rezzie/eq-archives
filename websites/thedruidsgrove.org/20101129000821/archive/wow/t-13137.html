<br />
Do i get the effects of the Improved Faerie Fire talent from another druids FF or does it only work for my own? <br />
<br />
Will it work with a druid tanks FF or should I be replacing it with my own?<br />

Personally, once the tank has pulled then established a threat lead, I refresh my IFF at will.</div></div><hr />

I think the assumption is that if you have it talented then you'll benefit from the self crit bonus of the talent from anyones FF. The +hit couldn't possibly apply to everyone if someone who doesn't have it talented applies it because then what would be the point of ever talenting for it?</div></div><hr />
