BUt since PoP zones are not used as much as thye use to be .I am having problems getting my turnin items (SP's and Glymp RUnes (sping) ) . Any suggestions for soloing to get these items. I currently Solo in HoH for exp and SP drops. But the Sp drops are few and far in between. <br />
<br />
I cant afford to buy the lvl 65 spells.. if they are in bazaar to sell they usually way too high in price. <br />
<br />
any help will be appreciated...</div></div><hr />

You could probably trio some BoT named with a 70 tank and slower.  I haven't been in BoT in well over 1.5 years though, so not sure how much easier the named are now.</div></div><hr />

Just find out which guild is elemental in your server and ask their members.</div></div><hr />

As far as soloing goes, you could try either root dotting or quadding (if you have enough mana).  There are several good threads about strats for fighting down there.  Harmony of Nature works great for pulling them away from each other and you can just run them along the wall of the room then (or root them there).<br />
<br />
I personally bring a necro buddy along and agro kite (this works great).  Just watch out for A Valorian Sentry (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10425) as they cannot be snared or rooted.<br />

When I used to quad kite, I'd do a test run with a single mob.<br />
Pull just one guy and see if you can kill him with Karana's Rage. There's no need to pull 4 it's the same thing.<br />
<br />
If you can't kill one guy, use your last bit of mana to egress and you have your answer.</div></div><hr />

They probably have a few toons full of parchments / runes. Or you can check into BoT and ask to send you a tell when there's one rotting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to AC and collect acrylia, break it down to small pieces and sell. And sell all the runes you get. And sell any drops from nameds. <br />
<br />
I find it easier, most times, to collect cash than to go farm for items needed for say tradeskills or whatever, and then go buy what I need in the Bazzar.</div></div><hr />
