After breaking thesse down, even if I slot crit gems, over all it still looks like a loss for me.  Opinions?<br />

Cover of the Keepers seems more suited to someone who plays resto and boomkin (dual spec) but doesn't have (or want) two sets of gear.<br />
<br />
I always see hit &gt; dmg &gt; crit when people talk boomkin but they always leave out haste :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kai</div><div class="date">05-11-2009, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I went with the Cover.  I recently change guilds and went from not clearing 25 naxx to downing bosses in 25 Uld so I have no basis for comparison to see, given my gear, if I'm making the DPS numbers I should.<br />
<br />
I use a lunar rotation most of the time unless a boss calls for a lot of movement then I use a solar.  So my rotation looks like;<br />

IFF &gt; IS &gt; MF &gt; wraith spam till eclipse &gt; SF ... and repeat renewing DoTs as needed outside of eclipse.<br />
<br />
Here is my armory Link (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Lothar&amp;n=Kaillon).<br />
<br />
Since armory doesn't seem to show my &quot;in form&quot; stats here they are (buffs = Mark)....<br />
<br />
SP = 2091<br />
+Hit = 248 (I know this is under cap, I have hit food)<br />
Crit = 24.36%<br />
Haste 434 or 13.24%<br />
<br />
And the WWS report (http://wowwebstats.com/yejbgd3xj5eti?a=x2000000005136f9) from last night.  Given the bosses we're taking on have a lot of multi-target elements this maybe normal.<br />
<br />
On a target dummy I avg 3k DPS, using OOM after innervate as mine end point.<br />
<br />
So back to the question in all of this is.....Am I 'making the grade' given my current gear and such??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">05-11-2009, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think 3k -3.5k DPS is what I expect considtently from our boomkins in i213.  <br />
<br />
I know our DPSers that were doing 4-5k in Naxx are down to the low 3k range in Ulduar.  There is just a lot more movement and &quot;oh ship&quot; moments for us right now, so they can't just stand there and pew pew.  My mage pulls about 4k in Naxx and does about 2.3k in Ulduar.  He is in more i200's than i213's but does have an amazing staff from Freiya.  <br />
<br />
So in summary its really tough to judge without seeing how your commrades are performing and in what gear.  If your tank is nipping at your heels on the damage meter, its time to pick it up.  If not, I wouldn't worry about it!</div></div><hr />

if u lok at my armoury what sort of performance would you expect from me in 5 mans....<br />
<br />
http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Bronze+Dragonflight&amp;n=Kheldar<br />
<br />
as you i dont raid so my hit is very low. we've had a few people with us we know who do 3k dps at the end of a 5 man....a rogue and a pally spring to mind.<br />
<br />
i'm hoping to upgrade my gear over time with some boe's from uldaur, some are slowly appearing on our AH or via new high level crafted items which i believe Blizz added in 3.1 ?<br />
<br />
oh and a quick question as well :<br />
<br />
would you say I could go to 10 man Naax or the Vault place and hold my own ? (barring my poor hit?)<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

I would strongly recommend the &quot;cloth-waist&quot; for 40 emblems of heroism for you. It has a ton of hit, haste and SP.<br />
It's really nice + a yellow socket which is perfect for a 16 hit gem and the socketbonus is +4 hit too.<br />
<br />
And i would go to Wintergrasp to make some marks and go for the +95 HIT trinket.<br />
<br />
Does 2 things should get you to a really nice gear-level for all 10 mans and even 25 mans (naxx, archavon).<br />
<br />
But with 46 HIT it's a real pain. Just sacrifice some of your crit for hit and you are good to go!</div></div><hr />

Another option if you don't WG is to farm H-VH (get your badges) and a shot at Mark of the War Prisoner (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37873).<br />
<br />
The WG one is pretty easy to get though if you just make sure to get in their on offense (almost always a win)<br />
<br />
Also, be sure to pickup some Extreme Snapper (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42996) and  Elixir of Accuracy (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44325).  You could easily do Naxx 10 or 25 in your gear though.<br />
<br />
Trinket = 73-95 Hit<br />
Food = 40 Hit<br />
Flask = 45 Hit<br />
158-180 Hit Total added</div></div><hr />

<br />
RL really does not allow it - i just wondered if i get an invite from some people i know now and then how would i fair.<br />
<br />
cant say the thought of farming WG brings me much joy!<br />
<br />
i'll take another look at the waist s3R - i know i discounted it as i felt the hit it had was a waste given i dont raid and therefore is was not really an improvement on my current cloth one!<br />
<br />
cheers.</div></div><hr />

I think you will see a pretty significant boost in your DPS even in just Heroics by boosting your hit to the +150 range.  Do you run recount?  You should see how many times your &quot;Spam&quot; attack (wrath/starfire) miss over the course of a run.  I am guessing 10% range with your current hit.</div></div><hr />
