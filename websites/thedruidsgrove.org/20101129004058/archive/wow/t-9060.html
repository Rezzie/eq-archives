Here's the link to the computer:<br />

How well will this run WoW and other modern market games?<br />
Also, is the site an american site? Or hopefully a Canadian?<br />

Newegg has been pretty reliable when I've ordered from them; I believe they're a US company, but as you notice, the PC is actually from Acer.<br />
<br />
As for the PC itself, it looks like it'd run WoW decently, if not great.  However, I'm not familiar with the graphics card at all (looks like the built-in one?) and you might have to upgrade that, possibly add a little more RAM too.</div></div><hr />

(hint) Thanks, and sorry for putting this in the wrong main, ^^ Also, since, its American (newegg) the warrinty, is invalid, meaning if something goes wrong, im seal-ed, and theres nothign I can do, but is it worth the risk? any suggestions, or even some help planning a custom made one that I could put together would be most appreciated, thanks TDG!</div></div><hr />

If you was to buy that, the first thing you need to upgrade is the Power Supply. 300W will not cut it, if you plan to upgrade a single part on it.<br />
<br />
Once you open any PC you normally void the warranty anyway. Have to read the fine print, which changes from maker to maker.<br />
<br />
Anything above 2ghz with 1gig Ram, and a good video card will run WoW just fine. Remember Windows suckes up a good 256meg on it's own. Another 100ish for virus/firewalls. Then WoW takes 300ish to run correctly in crowded area's. Then add on your UI load.<br />

Yeah, a custom job seems the cheapest option at the moment, however noone will take this gauntlet, as I have no computer savvyness in me, exept I know the basic stuff. Still looking around, however, if anyone could suggest a list of parts that would be good running the new age games, that would be more than appreciated, ill even give you the honor of being ganked by your-truley  :ange: , I just need a system that will run the games decently, I dont need a monster!

I purchased one from them and so did a friend. Nothing but a positive experience. Even when I had the DvD drive explode a CD on me, they were quick to send me a replacement. I custome built mine, but they have some pre-made packages that are good too. Prices are extremely competitive.</div></div><hr />

Thanks again so much! You've all been extremely helpful and every one of you has my deepest gratitude for taking the time to answer my questions. However, if anyone has anything else they wish to add, please, you are more than welcome  :) And I'm still open ot suggestions for a bustom built computer, which seems like the bes,t and cheapest alternitive. Oh, Fal, I went to IBuyPower, great site, still a bit pricy cause its in Amercian, but good nonetheless, exellent suggestion!<br />

CPU's of today pull a good 100 watts on their own. Some even lean to the 120 watt mark. A video card(a good one) can pull 100 watts easy on it's own.   Then remember, RAM, DVD player/burner, sound card, lan card and USB ports all pull power. PC's pull power as needed, the wattage is not always constant.<br />
<br />
Just to give you a idea on power, a 42&quot; plasma TV pulls 387Watts. A 50&quot; Plasma TV pulls 580Watts. It's very easy these days to push the 400+ mark on almost anything.</div></div><hr />

The 5xx series and the 6xx series. What's the difference? Not much but some more cache and 6xx series is enabled to run in 64 bit. Now the otherside of the coin is, Intel plans to enable 64 bit on the 5xx series in the future. The 5xx processor was built to handle 64 bit processes, however it's turned off chip side. Why you might ask? I don't got a dam clue. To make more money is my guess.<br />

This PC can run &quot;almost&quot; any game today. Not the fastest, but a good little PC for normal useage.<br />
<br />
You can drop the price more by just picking the cheapest parts money can buy. Then you just built a &quot;budget&quot; system and you can get that from any PC maker. And I bet the farm, you'll hate it and want to upgrade it in 6 months. Then learn you can't due to the cheap parts used to make it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hertzsae</div><div class="date">07-12-2005, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My first suggestion if you are worried about a warranty and don't want to build yourself is to try to find a local system builder.  They are going to be a bit pricier then building yourself, but there's no better support then when you can bring your computer in, instead of calling a help desk.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to build your own then read on.  I usually use guides as a baseline on what to buy, because I don't stay as current with hardware as I used to.  If you're looking to spend under $1000 US (sry), then I'd check out these two guides, they are a little dated, but it's a good starting point and the prices will only be cheaper today.<br />

Warcraft ran great and lag for me with an Athlon XP 2500, ATI 9600 SE, and 1GB memory.  It's not exactly future proof, but as long as you get something like that or better, you'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here are the specs:<br />
<br />
Gigabyte Geforce 6600 AGP8XDDR 128M 128bit<br />
Pulse 3-Piece speaker set<br />
Philips 17'' LCD Flatscreen Monitor(booya)<br />

Antec SLK1650B Black Case with 350PS and 120MM Fa<br />
LG 52X32X52 CDRW / 16X DVD-ROM<br />
<br />
Tell me what you think, and if theres anything in here I should change, the 350PS is due for some consideration, but this list was put together by a professional computer techie, so 350 must be fine for a PS, thanks in advance for your input! Also,<br />
 Id like to ask something else: What will the gameplay be like in games like WoW or any other MMO's I get my gamey little mitts on? OK? Good? Awesome! So spectacular that you acutally think you're in the game and you go around wearing crazy tree armor(made exclusively of your backyard) and swing a staff with some glow-wands duck-taped to the end (think about the GLOWing) and proclaiming yourself grand pubah of the Horde and calling every person you see a dirty alliance scum bag poop-head abomonation-dating carebear?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, this computer(There was other stuff I left out cause I didnt think they were important) is gunna set me back $1687.15, thats with tax and the fee for the actual construction of the computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want the most bang for your buck, honestly you should &quot;market watch&quot; Dell.  They sometimes stack multiple coupons and you can get a barebones system for under $300.  For a gaming rig you usually have to add RAM and a video card (sometimes a hard drive) but it still comes out cheaper than most prebuilts.  If you feel confident enough to install those devices, then Dell's the way to go.  If not, well then I go with what everyone else has said so far :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rahjeir</div><div class="date">07-14-2005, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gigabyte Geforce 6600 AGP8XDDR 128M 128bit<br />
<br />
No, don't waste your money on that video card. AGP8X is soo dated. HD is too small for the money your spending. Not even a Raid set up in it. You can do alot better. No DVD writer either. For that price there should be one in it.<br />
<br />
Hrm..... If you wanted to spend that much I would've said buy a Dell. My Dell cost me $1702 including the shipping and taxes. And I bought it in March 2005. Some things on it just came out. I.E the 650 P4 series<br />
<br />
P4 650 3.4ghz<br />
1 GB DDR2 Ram(PC4200 I think. It was 4000 something)<br />
PCI Express 16x Gforce 6800 with 256 meg DDR Ram<br />
7.1 Creative Sound Card<br />
19&quot; Dell LCD Flatscreen Monitor<br />
2x 160 gig Hardrives /w 8 meg cache, running a Raid 0 setup<br />
16x DVD-ROM<br />
Dual Layer DVD +/- RW<br />
<br />
And more misc stuff, plus a crapload of programs.<br />
<br />
For close to 1700 you can self build a much better PC. However, I know not all can do this. But if your going to spend 1700 I would buy a dell or go with a bigger little guy maker. Those guys are not giving you the best bang for your buck.</div></div><hr />

This is troubling, I thought this was a reasonable price... also that 1700 rig you have, thats American no? That means that in Canadian that thing costs ooooooh 2,000 dollars, keep in mind Im canadian, and good things come more expensive to us &gt;.&gt; Im still gunna go with this rig, however, ill upgrade it as I see fit, or, if I can find a builder, which I have but hes too fuggin lazy to get back to me, then I'll build it from the ground up.<br />
<br />
Also, I requested the HD be smaller, in exchange for a gig of ram, so it equals out. <br />
<br />
Anyone else have anything to add? Or even better, inform me in the way's of &quot;market watching&quot; its be greeeeeaatly appreciated. I dont trust my brother with a new comp, so Ill be saving until he gets outta the house (spet.26th), so ill have plenty of cash, so we'll see then.....<br />

Check the forums for the first two links, most of time the best deals never make it to the front page.  The third is just a general collection of coupons for online retailers.  If you have a &quot;spam&quot; email account, it's sometimes worth it to sign up for promotional lists like Dell's or Buy.com - many times they send out single-use coupon codes.</div></div><hr />

Check out cyberpower.  I think they give the best deal.  The below link takes you to a configuator which will allow you to add and substract &quot;stuff&quot;.  If you want a base machine with more or less there are other base models.<br />
<br />
The below listing matches the above quote.  You can add a flat screen for between 100~400.  This system does not have an OS as speced.  You will need to &quot;get&quot; one...  You can down grade some stuff like the sound card or add stuff.  There is some 5% discount.  Check that out before ordering, that 5% may be below this price.<br />
<br />
PS there are Intel base models as well.<br />

I bought mine 6 months ago so prices have come down some, still a good deal. I think I would go with an ATI card now though. When I upgrade my video next time that's probably the way I will go.</div></div><hr />

Opps, I looked at shipping and found:<br />
<br />
NOTICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS <br />
We only ship to the 50 US states and APO/FPO addresses as listed in the selection box above. We do not ship internationally or to Puerto Rico, Guam, and US Virgin Islands. <br />
We do not ship to an address that is different from the billing address, unless it has been listed as your alternative address on your credit card company. We will not be responsible for any delay due to the length of time taken by the credit card company for this process. <br />
UPS Ground and UPS 3 Day Select shipping methods are not applicable on orders shipped to Alaska and Hawaii. <br />
For purchases with 5 or more number of items, we reserve the right to adjust the shipping charge. <br />
We do not tolerate credit card fraud, which is a felony. If it is determined that an attempted order is fraudulent, we will report all information to the FBI, at http://www.ifccfbi.gov <br />
<br />
PS Tech support is a little dodgy.  I use this company for the base unit and add stuff.  That is if you want clear english spoke when asking for tech support, do not go here.<br />
<br />
PPS  Other than that, I noted the items missing and you can add those items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've purchased components from them several times and always had good service. You can buy components, or they offer pre-built systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weoden</div><div class="date">07-22-2005, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a look at NCIX and YOU need to be very careful when you use their machine configurator.  I would suggest to use cyberpower's configurator and match the parts at NCIX.<br />
-&gt;Some red flags I saw when I poked around were the following:<br />
I would go with a 21&quot;/53cm case but I add/remove parts.  When selecting a case, look carefully to see if the case has a power supply.  There is a selection for a PS and some case appear to come with a PS.  You can end up ording 2 PS, I think.  Also, figure out what you want for components and have a spare or two bays.<br />
-&gt;Do AMD's come with a heat sink in the retail box?  I have only used Intel chips.  If not then you need to specify a heat sink and I would suggest thermaltake.  If you have a choice of chip types, I would go with 90nm rather than larger transistor lengths.<br />
-&gt;Do you need a modem?<br />
-&gt; the keyboard that is default is cordless and battery powered.  The biggest down side to battery powered anything is the weight and battery replacement.  I used corded.<br />
-&gt;I prefer an optical corded mouse.<br />
-&gt; I chose 1gig of pc3200 memeory.  I prefer to buy parts that are the fastest for the parts chosen.  In other words, the old navy saying is that you can only go as fast as the slowest ship.  That is true with computer parts.  Figuring out what the fastest parts that fit into the motherboard(mobo).  So, those parts are mobo, processor, memory and hard drive.  You can spend a lot on one part but that part does no good if your other parts can not take advantage of that part.<br />
<br />
The base system I came up with was 1,433cad/1,177usd.<br />
PS I just noticed that I choose a 3200 instead of the 3500.  That may add 100~200 cad.<br />
PPS be very careful before ordering.</div></div><hr />

That comes to a total of:   USD  $1,164.00, or $1,433.04 Canadian. I'm fairly certain that price includes shipping ($165! Ouch!), and the ibuypower.com setup is easily superior for roughly the same price.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudchaser</div><div class="date">07-27-2005, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The system I mentioned was from www.ibuypower.com (http://www.ibuypower.com) , not www.cyberpowersystem.com (http://www.cyberpowersystem.com) .<br />
<br />
The ibuypower.com site has an option for shipping to Canada, and bumps up the shipping costs from $85 US to $165 US to do so.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the system you mentioned would run WoW adequately enough, true, but I'm just saying that for the same money (even factoring in the higher shipping) you could get a substantially better system from ibuypower. <br />
<br />
It's certainly not a monster system either. . .  I just ordered a new computer from ibuypower that was nearly $1,400 even without a monitor, and it wouldn't even qualify as a monster compared to the new stuff that's out there right now!<br />
<br />
Play around with their options and you could even get a less expensive machine, I'd bet.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry -- you won't actually be buying it until you put in the credit card number or whatever!<br />
<br />
There'll be a little option to select your country. They look lile little US and Canadian flags.</div></div><hr />
