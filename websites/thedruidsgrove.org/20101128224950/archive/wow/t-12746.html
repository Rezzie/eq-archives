No flying mounts until higher levels.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't want us &quot;skipping content&quot; by flying over it.  Not sure about everyone else, but a 100% landmount is just stupid slow after having epic flight form for so long.  Might as well walk.:biggrin:<br />
<br />
So, I hope they give us some way to get a faster landmount at 70-71.</div></div><hr />

i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it looks like blizz has taken away our favorite toy :(<br />
<br />
here's another link that suggests we'll get it back at level 77, along with some other rumors: flying mounts that carry more than one passenger? i wonder how that's gonna work...<br />

total stranger: &quot;hey mate! can i hitch a ride to XYZ?&quot;<br />
me: im not going there, in fact im going in the complete opposite direction<br />
total stranger: can you take me by there anyway? it'll only take 5 minutes for you, but it'll take 10 minutes for me alone<br />

&quot;sure! hop on board!&quot;<br />
<br />
get up to a nice, lethal altitude, dismiss your mount, pop flight form, and fly merrily off while your leach plummets to his death...<br />
<br />
is that wrong of me?</div></div><hr />

I belive that this is in regards to the PvP area of Winterspring.  Think of a combat airplane IRL.  You might ahve a pilot to control the plane and another person to deal with the guns/bombs.<br />
<br />
I think that the multi-person mounts are for this.  one person flys the mount and the other person can cast spells or whatever.</div></div><hr />
