I got an on-screen message as soon as I looted the last silk, but it doesn't show up on the &quot;finished missions&quot; tab of the quest window, and when I returned to her, nothing was said when I hailed her.  I got faction hits and plat as soon as I looted the last silk, but I thought I was also supposed to get some coin that I could give to another person at the camp, for a bigger faction hit.  Oh and I still have the silks.  So is that it, or am I missing some last step in the quest?  And what about the faction coin?<br />
<br />
Also, I am not offered that mission any more.  Is that permanent, or timed?  It's the only one I can solo, so I hope it gets offered to me again ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Destroy the silks (you can destroy as you loot them).  There's 3 or 4 (I don't remember) different tasks available in that camp, 1 version of each for evil or good faction rewards, but iirc you can't do the one you just finished.  The bit about tokens is that when you do a group/raid mission, you get a token at the end depending on whether it was a good or evil mission, and you can either turn it in for the appropriate faction hit, or destroy it if you're not on that side, to avoid penalizing players for helping friends with opposing faction missions.</div></div><hr />

The spoilers on various sites I had read were confusing, they kept switching context between faction missions and crystal missions.  That's what got me confused.<br />
<br />
I did read somewhere that you can take the other mission from the &quot;gather silks&quot; npc, and then delete it, and then you can get &quot;gather silks&quot; again.  I hope so, cause with DoD just out, and most people already moving through DoN, it's impossible to find anyone to do these missions with.  I'll try it next time I log on.<br />
