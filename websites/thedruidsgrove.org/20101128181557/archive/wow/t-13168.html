General<br />
-  Players may now create death knights on any realm once they reach <br />
   level 55.<br />
-  Bonus Armor: The mechanics for items with bonus armor on them has <br />
   changed (any cloth, leather, mail, or plate items with extra armor,<br />
   or any other items with any armor). Bonus armor beyond the base <br />
   armor of an item will no longer be multiplied by any talents or by <br />
   the bonuses of Bear Form, Dire Bear Form, or Frost Presence.<br />
-  Racial restrictions on mounts have now been lifted. Night Elves on <br />
   mechanostriders? Tauren on raptors? You&#8217;re not seeing things.<br />

-  Reputation rewarded for killing mobs will no longer automatically <br />
   deprecate. This means trivial mobs will continue to give out their <br />
   full amounts of reputation on kill for the majority of cases in the <br />
   game (level 70 creatures in Stratholme, for example, will continue to<br />
   award the full amount of rep to level 80 players seeking to boost <br />
   their Argent Dawn faction).<br />

   attack power to be more appealing to other classes able to equip <br />

   the creature hates. This ability is now also unusable while affected<br />
   by Faerie Fire.<br />

   the disease which caused it. Will also no longer incorrectly increase<br />
   Death and Decay damage.<br />
   Corpse Explosion: Fixed a bug where how much Runic Power the Death <br />
   Knight had was affecting the damage done, and also increased the <br />
   damage substantially.<br />
   Dancing Rune Blade: The weapon no longer echoes the Raise Dead and<br />
   Army of the Dead spells. In addition it will now more closely match<br />

   had.<br />
   Opening: Opening doors and objects should no longer cause <br />
   shapeshifted forms to be cancelled.<br />
   Rake: The initial damage from this ability is now properly considered<br />
   bleed damage, and will be increased by Mangle and Trauma.<br />
   Savage Fury - Mangle (Bear) damage was being increased by a higher <br />

   (Bear) should see roughly a 16% damage reduction. Also fixed a bug <br />
   with Savage Fury where the Rake bleed effect was not being increased.<br />

   target instead of while they are moving toward the target.<br />
   Marked for Death: Now works properly for Steady Shot and Glyph of <br />

   mana when Living Bomb causes a critical strike.<br />

   do more damage than intended.<br />

   but unfortunately, Seal of Vengeance and Corruption damage will break<br />
   it again.  This will be corrected in a future patch.<br />

   this ability.<br />

   even if you had a shield in offhand. Now requires a 1hand axe, fist <br />
   or dagger to be able to be used. Bug #147699.<br />
   Fixed a bug where Thunderstorm (Elemental) was knocking back <br />
   15 yards, instead of 20. It should now roughly knockback the correct <br />
   length of 20 yards.<br />

   of this ability.<br />

   up when the Warlock is in range.<br />

   ability will now properly affect the scaling of spell power and <br />
   attack power on summoned demons.<br />

   the arena start time.<br />

I guess it goes with their whole fast leveling thing... they want to speed people along to the newer content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
although it was 4 yrs ago so the memory maybe a little hazy !<br />
<br />
its a shame they took out the epic flight form quest. that was fun and you felt you deserved the outcome after doing it.<br />
<br />
but i agree with s3 - whose gonna go do sethhek much ?<br />
<br />
Can you solo Sethhek/Anzu now then ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah. takes me about 20-25 min to clear the trash and to down him :biggrin:<br />
(with trash i mean: stealth to his room and kill the 5 trash-groups before summon him)<br />
<br />
It always brings a big smile to me when i think about what a druid can solo!!<br />
I did all icecrown group-quests alone(yep the 5-mans too), except the final boss in the arena. It was just to mana-intensive to down him. (if i could consume more than 1 mana-pot in a fight i would have downed him)</div></div><hr />

After reading the strat of letting the eagle dps him down, I tried it over lunch and got him about 1/3 down before I had to log and go back to work.  So it can be done. :-)  but if he doesn't drop the mount anymore, there's not much reason for me to make the effort at 30-40 minutes per run, once a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought the ZA Bear was a 'always get' if you completed it within the time ?? If so then that's the reason for its removal and would also make sense that Anzu still drops the mount - which is simply 1 of the possible loot items he can drop (on a very very very low percentage !)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I looked up to see if there was any mention of the mount not dropping after 3.0.  Couldn't find anything definitive either way, but I did stumble across this gem on Thottbot:<br />
<br />
I just soloed Anzu as a level 80 restoration druid. I stealthed in to the instance to Anzu, touching no mobs. I then used the soothe animal ability on 'Cobalt Serpent', to get in range of orb to activate the boss fight. Once spawned, I stood in the position shown in the screenshot, then just used the 2 macro's which activated the Eagle Spirit (aoe damage) and Falcon Spirit (haste) with rejuvenation spell for the entire fight. <br />
<br />
Doing this took 40 minutes to kill him without directly hitting him (The timer shown in screenshot was started at 50% health, finishing the fight at the 20min mark). <br />
<br />
During this time Anzu never moved from his spawn spot, at 66% and 33% health, he did NOT banish and didn't call down the bird adds. Once I got him down to 5k health, I hit with star/moonfire to kill him (just incase i wouldn't get credit for the kill (Note: at that point he became aggro and attacked me)). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately after this 40 minute effort, he didn't drop the mount. <br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
The only thing to note is that the cobalt serpents are immune to soothe animal now (too high level) and hibernate.  No big deal, at 80 they have to be practically on top of us to aggro.  Just time it so that you activate the moonstone just after the cobalt serpent passes you on it's circuit around the stand.<br />
<br />
I've tried it twice now, first time ran out of time and had to abandon, then last night got him down to 8k before I got impatient and tried to nuke him.  Doh.  That was 45 minutes wasted.  He banished and summoned the swarm of adds at &lt;1k, and, well, 1 dead tree. :-(  I may wait until dual spec hits then take him out the old fashioned way as feral.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess I need to check out the screenshot to see where he stands...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">01-23-2009, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's pretty cool.  If you stand in the location shown - off the point in the depression just behind and to the left of the summoning stand as you enter the room - nothing aggros you.  You don't even need to clear the serpent, just time the summon so he's away from you, then back up to the spot shown.  It's a little unnerving to stand in the middle of that room FULL of mobs and have them ignore you.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and the only mob I had notice me on the way in was one of the patrolling brown hawks - I was moving slow (stealthed) and he's one of the fast flyers, came up  on me from behind before I could step aside, and aggro'ed as he flew directly over me.<br />
<br />
That post is from the comments on thottbot for the Reins of the Raven Lord (or whatever they're called), about 3/4 of the way down.  http://thottbot.com/v4277986 - direct link to that post.<br />
<br />
I literally stealthed in, timed the summons, backed out of aggro range of the serpent (&lt;10 yards probably) then stood there for 45 minutes popping rejuves on the falcon and eagle.  On of the most boring things I've ever done, but it will be worth it if he drops the mount.</div></div><hr />

you could always raid the Alli cities for the [For the Horde] achievement, and get your Armored Blackbear. Or, if you have AV marks saved up, you can turn in 40 of them for your Frostwolf Howler.<br />
<br />
Now that Mounts don't take up bagspace, (and this thread has been completely derailed :grin: ) I've started a little collection. I think I'm almost up to 15. And yea, i think I'm gonna have to have a little reunion with Anzu and show her how much this bear has grown lol</div></div><hr />
