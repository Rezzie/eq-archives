<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tensley</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am realitively new to this - only been online for a month now.  I am a level 19 Druid Wood Elf.  I am having trouble finding several spells at this level.  &quot;Lightning Call&quot;, &quot;Protection of Rock&quot;  and the teleporting spells.  I have seached three Guilds and the Great Library wito luck, found some spells for that level in the Great Library but not those.  Can anyone direct me.<br />
<br />
Also if one wants to xp alone where might be some good locations for me.  <br />
<br />
Thanks much.<br />
<br />
Terry</div></div><hr />

But as far as i remember the teleport spells are sold by druid vendors at stone circles in Steamfont, East Commons, Toxx Forest, Lavastorm, East Karanas. <br />
<br />
On Lightning Call and Protection of Rock i cannot help. They came into game long after i passed their level. Perhaps they are sold in Surefall Glades or Shadowhaven.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kobara</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 19, teleport spells are sold in WC at the druid rings... the Protection line of group skins are all sold in Shadow Haven at the druid hall--- as I recall since they were added with Luclin expansion. They MAY be found elsewhere for those who did not get Luclin, but I know they are in SH for sure.<br />
<br />
www.eqdruids.com used to have a spell listing that included purchase spots by level for each of that level's spells. Not sure if it still exists since I no longer need it, having long ago memorized it from constant referral to it.<br />
<br />
Back in the early days of EQ, as an incentive for players to explore, spells for various levels were spread out so you had to travel for them to places you might not otherwise see in your daily playing time.</div></div><hr />

Good place to find where that next spell can be found and what it does.<br />
<br />
As to Lightning Call... no such thing... maybe you mean Careless Lightning? Anyway, it is found in NKarana at the rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">08-10-2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have just gone through my spell list in the hopes to complete a full spell book.<br />
<br />
If you know about Lightning Call, then you are looking at the direct listing from the database (my list is from Lucy).  Lightning Call although in the database as a 19 Druid spell and is attached to a couple of items (check Lucy for the items) it is not actually obtainable by a Druid and therefore can't be scribed.<br />
<br />
The same goes for Frost Zephyr at 44, this was a spell added at the time of LoY, but never actually went to scroll, so it is still listed as one of our spells but we can not get it.</div></div><hr />
