<br />
I have recently come back to WoW after a year and a half break....<br />
<br />
I find myself unable to solo well as a resto druid so have finally taken the plunge and gone feral. I am shocked at how well I can solo now. I mow through mobs!!<br />
<br />
Recently I came accross several identical items with the exception of 1 having strength and one having attack power. Understanding very little about Feral druids ( only been one for 3 days ), I have no clue which is a greater benefit. I mostly solo and spend the majority of my time in cat form. I searched the forums for any discussion of str vs ap and didn't find a good answer.<br />
<br />
Can someone break it down Barney style for me? I don't know which to use and which to drop.<br />
<br />
In case it's relevent I just hit 63 and here is my build<br />

Thanks in advance!!<br />

<br />
For solo kitty questing, I treat both +str and +agi as being worth 2 &quot;item points&quot; and AP is worth 1 &quot;item point&quot;.  If the item's total point value is greater than the existing item I replace it.  I use +sta, +crit and +hit as tie-breaker type stats.  If the new item has a 1-8 less &quot;item points&quot; but has more +sta, I'll take the one with more sta.  Same with +crit and +hit.  But, I always keep a set of gear with max +hit in my bags just for boss fights.<br />
<br />
I don't have a &quot;item point&quot; scheme for bear or healing items, yet.</div></div><hr />

If I'm looking strictly at DPS wouldn't STR be more benifical for DPS then AGI? I know AGI also gives +dodge,+armor, and +crit but  does this outweigh the +AP from STR?<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts<br />
<br />
Also can you go into a little more detail about your &quot;item point&quot; system. Thankyou</div></div><hr />

If you were in the 1000-2000AP range that Str ~= Agi and if you were over 2000 that Agi &gt; Str due to the increase in crit with Agi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Due to the beneficial affects of +crit to cats (primarily from Primal Fury) agi is actually more important than +str.  Though until you reach lvl ~62 (when you'll probably reach 1000-1200AP) I'd focus more on maximizing total AP than worrying about crit.  So, prior to lvl 60, I treated +str as &quot;2 points&quot; and agi as 1.  Once I reached 60-62, I treated +agi as 2-2.4 points and +str as +2 points.  +hit rating is ~1.1 points, etc.  (see Rawr and/or Emmerald's link below).  Add up all of an item's points.  the item worth the most is the best.  Though if the difference is minor, I take the item with more +sta.  And put the other one in the bank.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">04-14-2008, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agility is the better stat for most situations, especially questing and soloing.  As you say this is due to the extra crit chance it gives you.  It only takes 25 agility for a feral druid to gain 1% crit chance at level 70.  I typically go for agility over strength if it's a one-to-one ratio.  It is best to mix and match though, and I would take 25 strength over 22 agility..<br />
