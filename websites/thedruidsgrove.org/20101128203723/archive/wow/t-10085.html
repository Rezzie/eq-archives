<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've found conflicting information on different sites and figured I'd get it straight from the horses mouth.<br />
<br />
I just started making my wild leather pieces and I think that it starts the quest or are the quests to lead me to Tribal Leather set, I believe it is called.<br />
<br />
So is the tribal set the one that is good for druids?  This is my first run through WoW, so looking at the stats for something that lvl doesn't help me out that much.  From what I've read in other threads, it seems to be that instance drops are the way to go. But... I actually enjoy making most of my own gear and like wearing it.  I'm not in a guild and only lvl 35 so raiding isn't on the menu for awhile.  Just want to make sure I'm not going down a path that is utterly useless.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
also, I cant seem to find this anywhere...<br />
Where can I farm Turtle Scales?  I've never had one drop yet and they are like 2g a stack on the AH.  Thanks again : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Turtle scales you can farm on the coast of Tanaris or the coast of the Hinterlands.  Hinterlands are safer for your lvl as the coast of Tanaris has some elite giants that roam.<br />
<br />
You'll have to watch for a named Elite turtle off the coast of the Hinterlands too.  He's aggro and can kick much ass for a turtle.<br />
<br />
This is what you can make with the tribal: http://www.thottbot.com/?set=144<br />
<br />
Definitely good for Druids, healing and all that. There are better ( read Epic ) drops you can get from instance runs and other sets you can piece together if you really get into PvP and pick up your rank.  <br />
<br />
The Elemental leatherworking is better for Rogues or Druids that want to stay feral, but it is going to be a really expensive branch to go into as there are a lot of more rare drops to be had.<br />
<br />
The other, Dragonscale I think, mainly makes all mail stuff and something that a hunter would more aim at.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

Now I can get more than 5 of the 48 turtle scales I need for my wild leather quests (been buying them one or two at a time).<br />
<br />
I've been to Tanarsis I think, west of 1000 needles? but will have to take an adventure to find Hinterlands.  I suppose this will finally force me to do the second part of my water form quest if I'll be &quot;off the cost of&quot; lol.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reminding me to try to find the PvP vender.  I think I'm rank 6 now and haven't found him yet. &lt;puts on to-do list&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I mean by &quot;off the coast&quot; is really &quot;on the coast&quot;.  Though, yeah you really should finish up that sea cow quest ;) ( no that wasn't a knock on the Tauren ;) )<br />
<br />
Hinterlands is North East of Southshore which is North West of Wetlands.<br />
<br />
The hardest stuff to find for the wild leather is the wildvine herbs.  They are really slow drops, my g/f who is a 300 herbalist had never come across the stuff and they sell for mad $ on the AH *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great, I can put off the &quot;sea cow&quot; quest some more lol.<br />
<br />
Yeah I've noticed that the wildvine on the AH are few and far in between.  I'm paying 1g per 1 or 2 when I see them on there (which is a lot to me now that I have an avg of 1-2g on me at once lol).  I think I may need to start selling some of the 500+ thick leather I'm hording in my bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never seen a wildvine node to harvest (I'm 300 herbalist too), but I have looted some off corpses, particularly trolls (ones I got were in STV).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow didn't know the stuff was that rare, I'll have to add STV trolls to my farming list, thanks for the info.  I think I'm high enough to fight there now (last time I stepped into the zone I saw a lot of ??'s lol)<br />
<br />
<br />
Off the topic, gwmort.  your sig, I think I get half of it (computer retard here)  since binary code is 1s and 0s its implying that there are 2 types of people maybe?  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 is binary for 2.  ( I'm a programmer by day, WoW player by night ;) ).<br />
<br />
I've read that the Trolls in Hinterlands ( some kind of skinners particularly ) drop the wildvine more that else where.  That's where I shall be grinding tonight.  (thought I really want to hit 49 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">afroio</div><div class="date">02-15-2006, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got all my turtle scales from the beach that is on your right as you leave Theramore and go into the Marsh.  I skinned all I needed off of those turtles and they're lower level than the ones in Hinterlands.<br />
<br />
As for wildvine, I got all mine from the trolls in the hinterlands.  I focused on the ones between the pyramid and the lake.  I got my faction well into Friendly with the Wildhammer Clan just from killing those guys for wildvine.  Not that I can see any advantage to being friendly with them...<br />
Also, wildvine doesn't have its own nodes.  You get them from Purple Lotus nodes occasionally.<br />
<br />
I think Tribal is a great choice for druids.  I use the Warbear set for feral and Ironfeather for healing.  Devilsaur is also good for feral, but those things are still too tough for me to kill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soooo 8 deaths later, I reached the beach in the Hinterlands...only to find that they were all lvl 49/50 lol (and I'm 35).  While dropping to the desktop to re-read this post to make sure I went to the right place, the elite turtle you were telling me about decided to come say hi and destroy me lol.<br />
<br />
So I headed to Tanaris (and didnt die once. YEAH!) and those turtles were also way too high of a lvl lol.  So I guess I have 2 great spots to farm them in 10 lvls : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the ones just north of theramore Island in Dustwallow Marsh. (should be mid 30s).  There are also a bunch crawling around the murlock Islands further North, I know the murlocs are 35-38.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You could also get a guildie to help you out.  I know I've done so many times for lower lvl guildies :)<br />
<br />
I thought the ones off Theramore were in the high 30s, but I could be wrong, been a while since I ran that shore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-16-2006, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great guys, thanks for all the help lol.  I'll try Theramore tonight and see how that goes, with how I'm spec'd I can seem to take mobs down that are 4 lvls above me continualy or 5 lvls above with lots of resting (dont know if thats good or bad for my lvl) so even high 30s I should be able to have some fun with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-17-2006, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a winner lol.  Turtles on that shoreline are 36-40.  Thanks again guys.  Accidently found out that there is an alliance faction up the hill from there on my way there lol, thank god for travel form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-17-2006, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad we were able to help</div></div><hr />
