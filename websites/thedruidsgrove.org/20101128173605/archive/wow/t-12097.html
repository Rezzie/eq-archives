<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">10-24-2007, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forum reorder suggestion. I'm looking at these forums and I'm not really liking how they are organized; so I thought I would throw up a thread asking the community before I go and redo everything.<br />
<br />
The problem I'm seeing is we have information spread out and not enough activity to keep some forums busy. On top of that, the standard one &quot;equipment&quot; forum doesn't work very well on a class that has 4 different sets of equipment.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to do a little reorder. To better illustrate what I'm getting at, I'll leave it to my uber ASCII artwork:<br />
<br />
---- Site News ---<br />
The Grove<br />
----- The Guardian ----<br />
The Emerald Dream [General]<br />
For the Horde! [PvP]<br />
Quests (or some other snazy name with [quests])<br />
Trade Skills / Professions<br />
------ Preserving the Balance of Nature ---<br />
Balance Druids<br />
Feral Druids<br />
Restro Druids<br />
------- Others ----<br />
My Life for Aiur... I mean Ner'zhul [OT]<br />
The Ruins of Lordaeron [Flamers]<br />
Test Signatures Here Only!<br />
<br />
The general idea here is to try and organize data into more relevant sections without getting too detailed. I also don't see a reason for so many OT forums. Heck, I'd vote for removing the The Ruins of Lodaeron, too.<br />
<br />
What do you all think? Ya, nah, guice is a dumbass, f off? Post any comments here. This is your chance to get herd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like your proposed layout but maybe you should keep the Trade Skills/Profession section. In my mind, the different spec topics can contain info about leveling/raiding/talents. Unless you intend on having Professions related discussions in General.</div></div><hr />

I can see the purpose of a trade skills channel. In all honesty, I did forget about it and now that I think about it more, it could be worth while to have it separately. We'll start off with it separate and see how that goes. It's not hard to collapse forums, breaking them up however is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to clarify... if the feral / resto / balance sections  are specific to equipment I'd suggest making the titles more specific to equipment, otherwise I can see that you'd get more general posts under these sections.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking aloud on this one.... but maybe sections relating to levels eg: forums for level 0-35; 31-69 and end-game.  I'm thinking of those posts like 'help for a new druid' or 'where to level now I'm 40' etcetc that appear in the general forums.  See what you think, I'm just throwing the idea into the mix.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'll think on and post if I come up with anything.<br />

Take care<br />

Equipment, talent builds and play styles are all unique to each build type. Druids to switch builds pretty easily, but I don't think many switch them on a weekly/nightly basis.<br />
(Although, I do know some warriors that do)<br />

That creates a top heavy forum again. Similar to the argument brought up earlier, eventually all your communication falls within the higher tier threads. And then you stop having people visiting the lower tier ones. In my experiences, breaking out into level ranges hasn't worked out very well.<br />

My idea was to get some kind of separation between Feral, Restro and Balance based threads. The different spec forums would encompass more than just talents, but also equipment and play styles. Running quests and raids are completely different between each spec.<br />
<br />
As for your point 3, this is true. However, everybody always has their &quot;one&quot; key spec, whether it be a Balance or Feral druid respecing to Restro for a short period. The thought process is people need info for a specific talent build. Having separate forums allows order of that data, making it easier to locate build specific information.<br />
<br />
The way I see it; Talents, Equipment and play style are all talent specific. Quests, tradeskills are not. Thus why I see having talent based threads while keeping quests and tradeskills in their own forum.</div></div><hr />

I don't play a hunter nor have a played one past 20, but I do know druid play styles are so different between the specs, we have 3 completely different types of armor sets. They are practically different classes when switching talents. Having Talents in one forum doesn't working too well for druids. I mean, just look at our current board, where talents and spells are within their own forum. It doesn't get much traffic at all. Now, try to locate Balance specific info. ;)</div></div><hr />

With the 3 hunter builds, there is always 3-5 talent points in each build that are up for debate.  Maybe that's why talent discussions are more prevalent on the Hunter boards, than on Druid boards?!?!<br />
<br />
WRT gear, there are several types of gear for hunters as well.  +AP, +agi, MP5, +hit, etc.  All have different levels of importance depending on spec.  The differences are just more subtle than the very different gear specs required for the 3 druid specs (and 4 types of gear specs).  A hunter build that needs +agi, will still benefit from +AP, whereas a Restro Druid gains no benefit from +agi gear.  Just like Ferals gain no benefit from +healing gear.<br />
<br />
So, the 3 &quot;build&quot; forums would that encompass talents, gear and skills for that build?  That would make sense.  It doesn't make all that much sense to have a single gear forum, if that is your take.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that would be the purpose of the individual build forums. They would encompass skills, gear and talents related to that specific build.</div></div><hr />

If we were all a-holes it wouldn't mater how well you organized it.</div></div><hr />

But he's Horde. Not exactly an Alliance battle cry when you're referencing a Horde character.<br />

<br />
It's been used and overused so much that it has become a bit of a catchphrase on alliance side, in much the same way as &quot;kek&quot; has come to mean &quot;lol&quot;, because when a horde says &quot;lol&quot;, alliance see it as &quot;kek&quot; due to the language difference.<br />
<br />
It has an obviously humorous overtone and I think 90% of Alliance would realise where it's from.  There again I've only ever played on one server, so I might be totally wrong.. :&gt;<br />

<br />
I had this idea in the shower this morning.<br />
<br />
Would it be possible to create a subforum, &quot;secret clearing&quot; or something like that, somewhere that only TDG members with 50+ posts can see (to everyone with &lt;50 posts it's invisible).<br />
<br />
The purpose of this forum would be for regular posters to have non-WoW-related discussions.<br />
<br />
Currently there is no suitable place for us to have a &quot;how do you look IRL&quot; thread, or a &quot;best music for druiding?&quot; thread, and so forth.  Having this forum around would strengthen the community by providing a place where members can get to know each other beyond their individual theories on druiding and warcrafting.  Making it invisible to new signups makes the community feel less cliquey for the seedlings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, just an idea :&gt;<br />

<br />
Cliquey isn't an issue, imo. It's a forum and a forum community. New seedlings would rather see a real community than just random posts and here and there from random people. I think having it viewable would be most beneficial.</div></div><hr />
