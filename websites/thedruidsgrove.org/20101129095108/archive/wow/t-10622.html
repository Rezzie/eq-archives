I'm trying to save for my mount and debating giving up the Alc to take skinning, with the thought that I can always come back to Alc later (starting at 1 again I know). Is it worth me changing talents? I'm going to keep herb as I can make a good profit selling them, 10g for a stack of swiftthistle, ker-ching :)<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

If you are benefiting from your Alchemy I would say keep it but focus primarily on selling you herbs for profit. With that said I did get the majority of my mount money from skinning my other prof is enchanting which is a gold sink as opposed to a maker until upper levels. <br />
<br />
I have mentioned this in other threads, The way I did it was sell my leather and supplement that with the sale of books and recipes that people are to lazy to get themselves. You could sell your herbs as you are doing and if you re making that much gold off of one you are doing better than i did with leather. Than also travel to Arathi highlands (if alliance) and get the first aid books they sell for a minimum of 100% profit and also stealth to a vendor in the alterac mountains (I can give better directions if you need them) and by the rare frost oil recipe that can be bought for less than a gold and sold for at at least 2.5 g. That would be my advice. You have put the time and effort into getting alchemy that far I would just keep it there and sell your herbs until you get your mount than focus on your alchemy again.</div></div><hr />

You will be better off keeping herbalism and selling your herbs in the AH, and buying any pots you need from there. Or better yet, bring your herbs to an alchemist to do the combines for you. <br />
<br />
Honestly all the tradeskills are huge money sinks, if your goal is to get your epic mount as early as possible your best bet is to have two gathering skills (but only one that requires tracking, so no herbalism/mining combo). Enchanting is a good skill to have as it lets you disenchant the items you don't need and you can sell the dusts/shards in the AH, and also later on farm lower level instances to do the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurg</div><div class="date">05-23-2006, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am going to respectfully disagree with most of the posters here. Alchemy can be a great money maker IF you make the right potions and know when what sells, For example weekdays make a couple stacks of heal and mana each day and put them on the market they sell well for the people who are out grinding the week away, Weekends its all about the PvP pots, Arcane Elixar, Free Action, Limited Invun. you can hardly keep those in stock. It takes alittle time and some decent memory to make good mney with alchemy but it is doable i already have my mount money now to finish off those last 8 levels so i can buy him :)<br />
<br />
Best of luck in your decision</div></div><hr />

I think I'll keep the alchemy, make bits and bobs here and there to use and sell, but mostly sell the herbs.<br />
Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />

From what i see the recipie averages around the 100g mark on the AH, which is what i paid for it, unless you are lucky enough to get it as a drop or like Claritondeus on these forums found it on the AH for 1g (you lucky, lucky bastard).<br />
With Essence of Undeath around 25s - 45s each and Essence of Water selling for between 6g - 12g it is easy gold for clicking one button once a day (you can only make one a day due to 24hr cooldown on the Philosophers Stone).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It allows you to make a couple of gold every day (or every other day) without getting any mats or running around looking for anything, and you can do it while returning to town to repair and check the AH without a big time commitment.</div></div><hr />
