<br />
I am not sure if its just that my Resto buddies are way over skilled or if Resto's are still embarassing all other healers with talents/abilities.  <br />
<br />
One thing I have noticed is that priest can't clear poison, which is a huge debuff in Wrath Heroics. <br />
<br />
I have a 35k+ health pool and preist seem to struggle to keep me +50% in most heroic boss fights, while resto druids seem to have no trouble keeping me +70% for almost the entire fight? (Dred...etc are obvious exceptions)</div></div><hr />

I just hit 80 last night, I'll have to get back to you on it.  We aren't 25 man raiding yet and I have yet to do a heroic or 10-man raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-15-2008, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done Naxx-10, but not any 25 mans yet.  We are running with 3 healers, so as a tank, its very hard to tell who's doing what.  We cleared 9 bosses on our run, including patchwork, so as a whole, our healers are doing an excellent job.  <br />
<br />
I guess I was refering to 5-man heroics, where its obvious who is responisble.  I am wondering if my high avoidance isn't part of the problem, I go from not taking any damage to all the sudden getting hit with 3-4 big hits.  I think the rolling hots just pickup any damage I do take as to where the priest/pally would have to heal more &quot;reactively&quot; rather than proactively. <br />
<br />
Also, I am noticing high regen rate for Resto's that other healers don't have.  As feral in my healing set my non-cast regen is 630ish.  <br />
<br />
My favorite resto actually has a trinket that increases spirit each cast (stacks to 10) so he literally has life bloom on me the entire instance! (while others drink to refil mana he just spams LB/Rejv)</div></div><hr />

But for group-healing shamis and priests just blow druids away.<br />
And paladins.... NC...</div></div><hr />

Majestic Dragon Figurine (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40430) off Obsidian Sanctum ... it's so bee-yoo-tee-ful *sniff*<br />
<br />
I think priests are still getting used to new mechanics, what with both Disc and Holy being raid spot worthy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-17-2008, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, he got a sickly trinket that is a BOP trash drop from heroic UK. It gives +107 spell power plus some sort of regen bonus.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after talking to our healing core a bit more, it turns out the druids numbers just look so huge because he is keeping the main tanks so there was just a lot more damage to pickup.  Our priest was more or less just HOTing the tanks and then cleaning up splash damage.  (also, she forgot to train level 80 skills...oops)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">12-18-2008, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't give too much credence to WWS for healing, unless perhaps someone is healing like substantially less.  Group heals will always make those numbers look huge and impressive but that isn't going to keep a tank alive.<br />
<br />
Last night's raid the two druids out-healed the priest by over 10% each but there could be a lot of explanations for that.  She was taking care of raid heals, we were on the MT/OT for the most part.</div></div><hr />
