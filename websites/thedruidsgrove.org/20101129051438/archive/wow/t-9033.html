<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vishiano</div><div class="date">07-02-2005, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know blizzard already said that multiple sets of armor are something that druids just have to deal with in WoW, and that other classes have to deal with this problem too (still havent seen a shaman with 2 complete sets of armor he actually uses), but i have an idea to fix this, at least for feral druids.<br />
<br />
First off, the reasons multiple armor sets suck.  <br />
1. Take up space in bags<br />
2. Multiple sets of armor means fixing more armor, thus higher repair cost<br />
3. Instead of having one piece of armor to buy, you now need multiple, so muliple vendor cost<br />
4. Cant switch armor during combat, so if you're caught unaware in the wrong form switching to feral form wont give you any advantage from you're armor<br />
<br />
My idea is basically this, when you're in either bear of cat form, you dont use mana or mana regeneration, (you do gain back mana but since you cant use it unless you shift back its not helping you) so why not switch the stats for the feral forms.  Intelligence could become strength, well spirit could become agility.  For example, lets say in caster form my druid has 60 strength, 50 agility, 100 intel, and 90 spirit, now he shifts into bear form, and instead of the stats being the same, have his strength be 100, and his agility be 90.  This would focus a druid on the 3 stats that are supposed to be good for druids, intelligence, stamina and spirit.  Eliminating the need for multiple gear sets.  <br />
<br />
The numbers I used are just an example and in practice it might be better to just take a percentage of intel and spirit and switch them.  Maybe 75% or so would still be better than multiple sets of armor.  <br />
<br />
Armor that gives strength and agility would not have any effect in feral forms, or it could be that they just add a percentage to the stats in feral form.  I think this would work since i dont think ive ever seen a druid built around melee combat in caster form, thus strength and agility are not often used.<br />
<br />
I personally think druids need to be redone in WoW, but this might solve one problem, feedback always appreciated, (unless its about spelling  :smile: )</div></div><hr />

I'm lvl 42 and can still kill elites +2 lvls above me (providing they aren't anything special themselves). I don't use 2 sets of armor and stick with int + sta/spirit armor. I don't see anything wrong at this point so far...<br />
<br />
I would be nice to have more general sets of armor for druids, I guess, to make feral tree more appealing. But lets face it, druids always become the backup healers (or main in some cases) which will always make int/spirit the primary stats. And it would be unfair to other classes if druids got best of both world armor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">07-03-2005, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you start getting some of the epic gear, its also basically the same gear you would use in any form, so you dont switch much.  I only switch Cloak, Bracer, Rings, Trinkets for forms now, maybe gloves if i ever get Cenarion, and not wearing my Slaghide.<br />
<br />
<br />
And at 60, I am not carrying much quest items, and other junk with me, so having 1 16 slot bag full of armor, trinket and other stuff doesnt bother me.<br />
<br />
The only thing that does bother is, when you I get jumped or a fight goes sour and I cant switch some of my gear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">07-04-2005, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I carry 2 and a half sets of equipment on me, I have my wildheart gear for when I want to heal, I have some agi/atk power gear for dps when I am soloing in cat, and a full set of tanker gear. I am always mixing and matching depending on the situation, if I need more health, or more mana. Yea it does take up a lot of bag space, but I look at it this way - If hunters have to sacrafice a bag slot to just ammo, I can deal with sacraficing a bag slot to swap gear. I don't have any issue with it, I just see it as part of playing a class that can do pretty much anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">07-05-2005, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my bags are overflowing with extra gear.  One cool thing that I like about being a Druid is I get to loot good rogue gear too.  I've been in lots of groups where I got to grab items such as the &quot;Blademaster Leggings&quot; or &quot;Bone Ring Helm&quot; because there were no rogues around to need them.  A lot of items that I would like for my feral gear I do have to pass up on, but then again, a lot of times I'm the only guy who can use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-05-2005, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't classify Bone Ring Helm as a rogue item that would only go to a druid if it's gonna rot....it's much more of a druid helm than rogue. <br />
<br />
141 Armor<br />
+6 Strength<br />
+30 Stamina<br />
+6 Spirit<br />
+6 Intellect<br />
+5 Agility<br />
<br />
The rogues certainly can't use the INT or SPI, while a druid will use all the stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">07-05-2005, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that would be more of a druid helm. A rogue can get better. STA is nice, but damn that agility stucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">07-05-2005, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I dont disagree with that.  I was just pulling **** off the top of my head.  I got the Eye of Rend this weekend.  It's SAWWEEEEETTTT</div></div><hr />
