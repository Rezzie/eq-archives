Healed the instance in Tree-form and cleared everything right up to Shade of Aran with no wipes.<br />
<br />
As a Tree (AKA the SLOWEST mover in the game), I had a heck of a time trying to run to the centre or to the outside of the room while having to keep up the heals.  His Blizzard ability got me every flippin' time!  I was always the first one down - thus the cause of the ensuing wipes.  <br />
<br />
I tried morphing out of tree to get faster movement, but my heals sucked.  Heck, I even tried morphing into bear form to gain stamina while on the move, but that didn't help much either.<br />
<br />
I hate that I can't seem to get the strategy down for this fight.  Aside from swapping me out for a better healer, any of you fellow Trees who have beaten him have any stategies for me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When he casts Blizzard, shift out into Caster Form, Run to the Back of the Blizzard (so you are following it around without getting hit by it) and shift back to Tree once it starts moving.<br />
<br />
To avoid the Blizzard, don't run in a circle...try to cut angles by running straight ahead and stay behind the Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Staying behind is a bit tougher than staying ahead...but if you can get it down, you should only be shifting a few times a fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">01-08-2008, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm...where to start.... :D<br />
<br />
1. Your heals dont suck if you are not in tree-form. You just go faster OOM. u wont miss the (maybe) 100 addheal too much.<br />
U can stay in treeform the whole time except for the time of <br />
arcane explosion(when u are slowed).<br />
<br />
2. Blizzard never hits you when you are standing in the middle of the room(i always stand inside of Aran for the time of blizzard).<br />
Aran has a silence which triggers when someone starts casting in a certain range(maybe 5-10). U are a druid-healer. U dont have casting time. So stay in melee-range and u wont get hit by blizzard.<br />
Just be careful to not draw aggro from Aran in this phase ;-D<br />
<br />
3. Helps if u dont know: In the fire-phase(dont know the name right now) when nobody is allowed to move. U can cast your HoTs without a problem. Just dont move or change direction.<br />

<br />
Shade has no aggro table, so it is random who he targets ( otherwise the tank would take all the damage ).<br />
<br />
When he calls out blizzard, run towards the center and find the back of it. Then move towards where it was.  It overlaps a bit, so you'll have to follow it for a bit, but you should be fine after about 1/4 circle.<br />
<br />
Don't move during flame wreath ( though you can spin in place, but absolutely no forward, back or side to side.<br />
<br />
Arcane explosion, just move to the edge.  <br />
<br />
There's too much movement in this fight where Tree becomes more of a problem than it is worth.  <br />
<br />
Most the fights in Kara are tree friendly with only a few exceptions:<br />
- Aran<br />
- Big Bad Wolf ( if you get little red riding hood too many times )<br />
- Netherspite can be rough as tree<br />
- Prince can be rough as tree ( depending on how you fight him )<br />
- Nightbane requires some movement but not much</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barkskin won't help you against that nuke - it's simply too much damage to mitigate it in that way.<br />
<br />
Magellan, I would suggest staying in caster form until you're more comfortable with the fight.  Aran is a tricky one to learn, and being slow tree of lol certainly doesn't help.  At the end of the day, an alive tree druid in caster form is better than a dead tree druid.<br />

Staying with the rogs is good, only problem is if you try to cast anything with a cast time, Aran will just counterspell you.  But that's np for leaf druids :&gt;<br />

Sweet.  Not quite there yet, but I'm healing the Shade fight in humanoid form just ducky now.<br />
<br />
I'm still - ugh - healing in (2) greens.  I will probably have to finally cave and purchase some PvP gear to replace them.  It seems my &quot;drops&quot; are never gonna drop.  :mad:</div></div><hr />

I should finish it up to show you why. It's like 40% complete. Give me 3-4 days to finish it up. Its already 5 pages long.</div></div><hr />

Helps alot in the aran fight when you see when the arcan explosion comes.</div></div><hr />

When he draws everyone into the middle for arc explosion, just start moving to the edge straight away, put on auto run and top everyone up while doing so. I always make it to the edge with two seconds to go. <br />
I really dont see how people get hit by it, just start moving straight away. (I do this in tree form with aussie server lag and mediocre internet).<br />
As for blizzard, these days i cbf getting out of the way so i just pop barkskin and heal through it and with a pvp health pot if needed lol. But i used to just run straight across the middle once when it got close to me, then run back when it got close on the other side. Both times in tree and with autorun on so you can click people and heal whilst running a lot easier.<br />
<br />
The idea is knowing when you will need to move, not reacting to the need to move. The 20% debuff is anoying but isnt life threatning if you know your stuff (read strats and experience).<br />
<br />
There are only a few fights where tree form might need to be dropped (nightbane is not one of them, neither is netherspite, or prince).<br />
<br />
PS: Oh sry, my bad, you do in netherspite, when you bear tank the red beam.</div></div><hr />

I recommend getting either Deadly Boss Mobs or Big Wigs.  You get a very visual notification and a timing bar (in Big Wigs anyway) before arcane explosion goes off.  You can see exactly how much time you have to get out of the area.  <br />
<br />
For Blizzard I sometimes have to run across the room rather than around the room.  I might get silenced for a second, but it gives me time to get away.<br />
<br />
I haven't had any trouble making it out in tree form usually with a second or so to spare.</div></div><hr />
