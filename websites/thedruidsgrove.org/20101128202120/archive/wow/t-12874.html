Welcome to our Druid's Grove :&gt;<br />
<br />
I want to help, but first I need to know what level you are, so that I can suggest specific items appropriate to your level.<br />
<br />
In general, you would want intellect, spirit, spell damage, and spell crit.  Those stats will help with both Restoration and Balance.  :&gt;  Stamina is a good all-rounder stat as well, although I would suggest to prioritise the other ones.<br />
<br />
Let us know how you get on :&gt;<br />
<br />

Just wanted to say that in WoW we don't say &quot;cross-class&quot;. There is no cross-classing.<br />
A talent spec that mixes elements from two different roles (tanking, dps, healing) is usually called a hybrid-build.<br />
<br />
With regards to gear: I suspect you are leveling at the moment, so just take what you can get. The stat priority given by Annikk is perfect for leveling such a build.<br />
Don't be shy about equipping cloth items. Yes, we druids wear leather, but for a caster it makes no difference, really, and up until level 60 most good caster items are cloth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so, I'd recommend running Scarlet Monastery a bunch of times to get some nice weapon/offhands:<br />
<br />
Weapon: Hypnotic Blade (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7714)<br />
Offhand: Orb of the Forgotton Seer (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7685)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest Razorfen Downs - there is a cloak and a neck for you there:<br />
<br />
Cloak: Mantle of Lady Falther'ess (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23178)<br />
Neck: Glowing Eye of Mordresh (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10769)<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, once you have levelled up a little more, you could try Zul' Farrak:<br />
<br />
Legs: Jinxed Hoodoo Kilt (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9474)<br />
Hat: Engineer's Guild Headpiece (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9534)<br />
<br />
There aren't all that many good items for Balance Druids until you reach level 58 and can take your first steps into Outland.  Hopefully this will help a bit though :&gt;<br />
