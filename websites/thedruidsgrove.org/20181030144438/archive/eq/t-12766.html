Misc Notes<br />
Assume that all expansions offered new spells, tradeskill recipies, zones, mobs, etc<br />
Any Pricing noted is off SoE boards only (current as of 12/2/2005)<br />
It appears that any expansion after OOW allows you to level upto 70 (confirm w/ DoD)<br />
<br />
I think this is near complete unless more folks post<br />
<br />
Any chance a Mod could sticky this, I think it provides some decent value to folks that don't feel the need nor desire to purchase &quot;every&quot; expansion<br />

<br />
Luclin bought The Nexus, and the old 15-min wait at the Wizzy Spires...<br />
<br />
PoP bought PoK and port stones/clicky-books.<br />
<br />
It's also very amusing to note (not to derail the thread) that Velious bought the least additional &quot;features&quot; of all the expansions but is still cited by many players as the best.</div></div><hr />

if you're in a group that's ports to a zone you don't have the expansion for it'll let you know with some emote and you'll stay in the zone you ported from.</div></div><hr />

It appears that if you buy any expansion after Omens, you get the option to level 66-70.<br />
<br />
Just now I thought you had to buy omens in order to level to 70.</div></div><hr />

My account had everything through GoD.  I bought DoD and was not able to level to 66 until I bought OoW.</div></div><hr />

I've confirmed this personally, on one of the accounts I have, it only had up to GoD, bought DoD and dinged 66 on first mob kill, omens is NOT required to level beyond 65 unless something got buggered up on either your or my account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luclin had the new-new UI near the end I believe (I remember playing with it on Test)<br />
<br />
Velious had a full screen UI, which gave 10 buttons instead of 8.  I still used the original &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I feel Velious is still regarded as near the best expansion since it had a lot of challenging content, the ring war (first scripted events), factions that mattered, velious textures for gear.  It really improved the game while keeping the old EQ feel alive.</div></div><hr />

That is probally true because DoDh has level 70 required AAs.  It will be difficult (until the next expansion :) ) to get Omens spells though.</div></div><hr />
