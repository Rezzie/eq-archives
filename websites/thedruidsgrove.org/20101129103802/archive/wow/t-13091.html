I don't want to scream nerf yet because in 5-mans this spell isn't that useful but has this impacted anyone's healing in a 10/25 man?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">12-12-2008, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depends on the druid.  I still see so many druids just relying on Wild Growth to carry them to the top of the charts, while they burn through their innervate twice and a feral druids.  I'm not going to say that type of approach to healing is &quot;wrong&quot; but it's not the path I'd take.  Keeping the hots rolling, and a swiftmend if the player dips painfully low seems more the role I would play my druid ( who is still at 70*sigh* I have so little time now for multiple characters. :( )</div></div><hr />

Cause in the time Wild Growth ticks 2 times a CoH and a healing wave and 2 pala-spells are on the targets.<br />
It helps in mass-aoe-fights but normaly its just waste of mana.</div></div><hr />

I know it's going to be a waste of mana thus the comment on burning through so many innervates =P</div></div><hr />
