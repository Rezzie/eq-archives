<br />
Personally, I'm hitting record-breaking numbers on latency... Last night i saw 2120 ms and like 10 fps while this patch is downloading...<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to just download the patch all at once, without being logged on and playing? I'd be a moron to try arena with that much latency, and I'm really trying to up my rating :(<br />
<br />
help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Day of a patch I use a mirror and often have it before some people finish it through the Blizzard downloader :D <br />
Patch Mirrors:<br />

<br />
now, when you say &quot;disable&quot;, all i have to do is doublelick on the blizzard icon on my taskbar and click 'cancel' on the download screen when it comes up right? or is there something else i should do under preferences?</div></div><hr />

So, Kyane.....<br />

The Wowwiki site seems to be down, do you have another (trusted) mirror site you can suggest for the latest patch?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-15-2008, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skwidrific, when you run the Launcher, and get the splash screen advertising various things happening in WoW, before you click the &quot;Play&quot; button, direct your attention to the bottom left of the window.  There you will find options that allow you to change your downloading preferences.<br />
<br />
It's always best to not use the downloader while playing.  If you want you can set it to download when you exit the game, or just do as I do and turn it off altogether to remove all risk and just download it on the day.  :&gt;<br />

Magellan,<br />
<br />
You can try two things:<br />
<br />
- As Annikk said, set it to download when you exit WoW ( just remember to leave your pc running )<br />
- Try the mirror page later and see if it's working for you.  If it still isn't working for you later, send me a PM and I'll send you some links to download the pre-patch and tell you where to place it.</div></div><hr />
