<br />
I'm also quering this topic as well.<br />
<br />
Thotbott only offers quests up to lvl 16.<br />
<br />
I'm a lvl 19 NE druid who was naughty and got summoned at lvl 13 to SW by some lvl 60 friends who wanted to quest with me using their new alts.<br />
<br />
I'm doing the VC (meaning i've had two very bad healers in two groups i've been with) and also the sealion pendant thing. (just waiting to go back to claim prize.<br />
<br />
Once i've done this, i've picked up some quests in Auberdine but with now clue to whats ahead.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of surprises that turn out to be really-boring-silly-wastes-of-time quests.<br />
<br />
Apart from keeping my eyes glued to this web forum, is there others that can help me with my eagerness to achieve greatness.<br />
<br />
thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">02-13-2006, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thottbot has nearly every quest ever discovered in game as far as I am aware. Usually there are some comments below the quest to help out visitors to the site as well. In the search box just type in the name of the quest and if it is a series type of quest, all the quests in the chain should be listed there as well. <br />
<br />
Allakhazam has pretty much the same information with perhaps a bit more - I have been using Thottbot since beta, and never have I hit that site and not found what I was looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-13-2006, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem I have found with thott is trying to browse, meaning if you didn't know the name of the quest, you'd have trouble finding it.  This seems particularly to be true when the quest involves multiple zones (ie picking up quest in one, achieving some goal in another, then turning in somewhere else), or when you don't know what zone to look for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lowkey</div><div class="date">02-13-2006, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically, thottbot has http://www.thottbot.com/?cq=Druid set up from when your lvl 1 - 16. Once you've done the aquatic quest, you should have picked up other new quests on the way.<br />
<br />
Its thottbots basic beginers walkthrough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">02-13-2006, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those are the druid's class specific quests.<br />
<br />
They have almost every quest given by npcs on the game on their website.<br />
<br />
There is a huge difference between class quests and normal quests.<br />
<br />
http://thottbot.com/?f=q<br />
<br />
Use the link and find any quest you want in any zone.</div></div><hr />
