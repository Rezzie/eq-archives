<br />
I'm undecided about where to go next.  Kind of torn between Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley.  Plus, I'm told Blade's Edge has great quests.<br />
<br />
Trying to base my decision on Rep building as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're level 68 as your sig says, head to Blade's Edge, leave Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley for after you hit 70 and can just soak up the extra quest turn in cash :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heat to Blade's Edge and you should hit 70, if not just a couple bars off it.</div></div><hr />

I managed to hit lvl 70 after completing all of the quest at the first town.  Left me with 2 and 2/3 zones of pure cash.<br />
<br />
BTW, there are quite a few CE rep quests in BEM worth doing.</div></div><hr />

Flew around to unlock my map.  LOVE being able to do that.  Except, of course, when I'm on &quot;autopilot&quot; (doing dishes in the kitchen) and I fly straight into a 72 Elite Dragon. :eek: <br />
<br />
Think I'll grind it out there, only 1 1/2 bars left 'til 70, and I'm gonna run as many instances as time allows.  <br />
<br />
Cool place.  Dragon's End?  No kidding!  Impaled dragons?  I look forward to meeting the &quot;Impaler&quot;  - NOT!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
had to spirit rez a few times cause my corpse was waaaay up there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">09-22-2007, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol. I was lolling so hard at all the Onyxias and Nefarians just impaled on the huge pinnacles sticking out from...everywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">09-22-2007, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, if you've chosen BEM as your &quot;quest area&quot;, finish EVERY SINGLE quest there before going to Netherstorm or SMV.<br />
<br />
Check www.wowhead.com and search for &quot;Blade's Edge&quot; and it will show you every quest available in the zone.<br />
<br />
Both Netherstorm and SMV have massive quest lists that will probably make you enough money for Epic Flight if you complete them at 70 and don't spend any cash till you're done.<br />
<br />
If you're at 69 or so once clearing BEM, hit up Shadow Labs a couple times for that final ding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm finding that leveling is hard to do the higher I go, not because of the difficulty, but because a lot of my lower level guildies (and buddies) are constantly asking me to tank for them for lower instances- and alas, I cannot say no.<br />
<br />
Grrrrr.  Someday, someday.  <br />
<br />
( On the upside, I am becoming an AWESOME tank. )</div></div><hr />
