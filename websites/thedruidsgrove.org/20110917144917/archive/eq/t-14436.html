Did you have a bard in your group? about every 10 min or so foe would drop off.

Did indeed, in fact when I went back there to solo it never happened</div></div><hr />

It's probably a bug. I was in Icefalls btw so two different zones</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">09-26-2006, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not only dispelling it, it only overwrites half of it . . . and turns the other half into a mammoth strength buff icon.  It confused the crap outta the shaman in our group the other night.  He was wondering why he was getting a wear off message for one of my spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyena Trueheart</div><div class="date">09-26-2006, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shaman buff is actually two buffs in one. It casts preternatural foresight which is the name of the spell, and mammoth strength which is identical to our spell. Preternatural foresight has an increase in avoiding melee attacks like sense did, and also has an unknown in slot two which I believe has to do with one of your stats. Our aura also has an unknown in slot two which I believe has to do with the disease cure. So the aura blocks the preternatural foresight part of the shaman spell, and will overwrite it if you cast it after you are buffed.</div></div><hr />

I found if I used the AA, I would still be visible along with every caster that had used a self invis.  I would basically not get one on myself and dispell thiers.  Kinda annoying to have to sit to mem single target invis's again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Debt</div><div class="date">09-26-2006, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my experience with this bug.<br />
 <br />
If I buff and cast FoE while in another zone then come to Direwind, it lasts full duration. No issues.<br />
 <br />
If I cast or Refresh FoE while in Direwind, I lose it every 15 min or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alei</div><div class="date">09-30-2006, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had problems with Shared Camo AA, also.  I've always been able to cast it with mobs near by and never aggro anything.  In Icefall the other day, a friend of mine asked for invis.  He was out of aggro range, but still in range for me to get invis on him.  I cast it and I aggrod two mobs.  Died and stuff, but that's beside the point.  <br />
 <br />
Supposedly, IVU and regular invis has been stacking according to guildies.  I haven't tried myself.<br />
 <br />
I don't know if this was intended, but the skellies in Dreadspire just across the bridge at zone in, are seeing through IVU.  (Dead again, but that's beside the point! =P)</div></div><hr />

Three times now, twice while i was by myself and once in a group i casted innate camo at the WOS port in, started running to COA (same way i always have) and its not holding.  Died twice and group killed the mobs the other time.  Is it my camo? wasnt an issue with buff slots i have plenty available or did they add a see invis right there where we drop down?</div></div><hr />
