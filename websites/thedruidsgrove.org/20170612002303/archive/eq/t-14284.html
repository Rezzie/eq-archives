I've seen Dev quotes that indicated experience gains will be slow :bs: <br />
 <br />
Due to the NDA, we can't talk about the good solo spots in TSS yet, and traditional grouping is an option, but I'm thinking solo or caster groups will be the way to go for most of our exp grind. I maxxed AAs so long ago that I am not really up on the best solo places pre-TSS. What suggestions do you have for kiting locations?:shuffle: <br />

 <br />
The Devastation is good, sometimes the pulls can get tricky.<br />
 <br />
Orcs in Elddar forest, just watch out for the casters. They have a nasty dot.<br />
 <br />
Also, I noticed 68.1 solo was decent xp, more for root/rotting though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kiting? 69.1 hard will be ideal -- during double xp weekend we got ~12 aa per LotD in a kite group, so will be 5-6 aa/hour w/o xp mods @ L70.  Since every mod there is L73, it'll be decent xp up til 75.<br />
<br />
However, the instance server is going to overloaded the first day or 2 of expac.  Non-instanaced zones w/ large amounts of L71+ mobs are illsalin, relic, sverag, elddar, hive (bridges/cacoons/orc room), and dreadspire.  Non-instanced nest has a few yellows as well.<br />
<br />
And best druid solo spot atm is likely trusik caves in qvic, but at 75 the xp there will be horrid.  The xp hits seem to be mostly 10%, sometimes 12% @ 70 - but since they have very low xp it's ideal for druid soloing.  69.1 hard will give 15% solo per mob, but a druid could solo 2 trusiks before 1 spider.  Yellows generally give 12% (in non-instanced hive at least.)</div></div><hr />

They are magic resistant lil buggers and the one I killed like to gate, he only did it once. I then tried to pull another and a friend was hiding around the corner. Looks like this will be promising once I establish a comfortable pulling technic. I assume it is relatively safe to do some tight kiting in front of the caves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overall I prefer Yxtta over 69.1 because those spiders are a bit heavy on hitpoints. However, it's a PITA of a downtime getting to Yxtta. <br />
<br />
When I don't have time and just want to burn my LoD, I sometimes still goto Vxed. It's still good for 1.4AA with LoD.<br />

Was wondering if my trio could do well there with the Ranger tanking (11.7k buffed - non-raid) and Druid healing?

No you can't, it just wouldn't be economical even if you could land a heal before the mob ate the ranger.  69.1 hard mobs hit upwards of 1600 and fast, the only real way tanking a 69.1 would be more worthwhile than kiting it is if you had an extremely well geared tank and either a shammy healer that slows or a bl slower that can dps.  Even then you're gonna be hard pressed to match the firepower of 6 dps caster classes.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
also do shammy wizzy bard shammy and me druid.....just got 70 last nite off 69.1 hard was nice.....usually its 3 of us shammy wizzy me and it is still fast exp....can't wait to get back to aa's at 80 now and want to finish all that i want before even thinking of 71....only reason i got 70 was for a pair of gloves and some other items.....fun times though!</div></div><hr />

We root/rot the mobs. Generally the other druid pulls with egress (he bots the bard) and then we all just load up the dots. It is great exp and I think you could do it with the ranger just shooting arrows and the druid root/rotting it.<br />

Good luck!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
That spot Kamion was talking about jogged my memory, I was in a group of 2 wiz, 2 necro, and 2 druid with 4 quads going and that was decent exp gain on the 2x exp weekend. 69.1 hard may work great if the instanced zones and not too laggy from overuse when the new x-pac comes out. Hopefully folks can add good spots from the new content here once NDA is lifted too.<br />
 <br />
Best of luck on your grinding! :wiggle: <br />
