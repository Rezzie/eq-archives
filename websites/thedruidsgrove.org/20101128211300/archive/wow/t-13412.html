<br />
i ask this because i recently picked up [Relentless Edge] from Ignis in Uld10. It's sexy. It's also my first polearm, so obviously, my polearm skill was 1. I equipped it immediately that night, since it was better then [The Undeath Carrier] with the enchant.<br />
<br />
At the end of the raid, i went back over recount, and noticed ~2% miss.<br />
<br />
That's higher than I recall ever seeing. I immediately went to Icecrown and started beating the piss out of mobs in caster form to raise my skill.<br />
<br />
It took forever, then i thought of a trick: equip ALL my healer gear, along with the polearm, and swing away. I did this because i wanted to deal as little melee damage on a mob as possible, AND it made healing and keeping a full mana bar a breeze. I would only heal myself when OoC proc'd. (I also did this partially because i play on a PvP server, and i NEVER want to be free honor) The bonus was that i also noticed my weapon skill getting higher faster.<br />
<br />
I finally got to 400 with Polearms this morning, and switched to raising my Unarmed skill, partly for the achievement (i think the name is funny) and partly for dealing with whatever class has Disarm. i Got that to 399. But i digress... (as usual)<br />
<br />
How much does weapon skill affect us in forms?<br />
<br />
Anyone have a better way to raise your weapon skills than the way i just described?</div></div><hr />

Easy way to level a weaon skill:  Find a low level (15-20 levels below you) start your auto attack, and alt tab out.  They won't hit you often enough, or hard enough to matter.  Until your weapon skill gets up, you won't hit hard or often enough to matter either.  I had to do this for my hunter once he was allowed to use staves.</div></div><hr />
