<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>TenerinBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Based on recent experiences of RL friends, it appears to be random.  They were in Ten Mtns for something else and sitting near one of the entrances to the Grimling caves and in 5 mins, 3 wandered by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fernwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have spent hours criss-crossing this zone now tracking everything and killing any mobs foolish enough to wander anywhere near the Grimling Forest zone entrance, but have yet to find a single tormented Vah Shir. Have they been nerfed into oblivion now? Has anyone actually seen one up this week? I guess I can hunt the vampires for entertainment....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tendria1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can find the tormented by the castle in Tene. Mts up on the hill and the corner of the castle.  Kill the ph's and they will eventually pop.  GL :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>fernwick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks, I did this last night/this morning and got all eight skulls. There seem to be at least two or three different spawn locations. Two of them are +825, -1300 and +35, -1090 (left &amp; right of the castle, respectively). The usual bats/soldiers appear to be the ph'ers still, but there may be others as well.<br />
