Much later on, around 46, when I realized that I had not gotten my aquatic form, I tried to do the quest. I followed the quest info from wowhead and allakhazam. eventually I recieved mail that said to talk to the main druid trainer in Darnassus. When I went to go talk to him, he had no quest for me. I also deleted the message that said to go talk to him. Is there any way I can still get this form?</div></div><hr />

What a royal PITA quest chain.  Took most of an hour to complete.  And you don't even have to fight anything.  Just run all over the planet and collect a couple of things.</div></div><hr />

Twice for myself, Alliance and Horde. Then I helped my wife on her Tauren. The longest part is running around. Getting the FP's on the way is a bonus tho.</div></div><hr />
