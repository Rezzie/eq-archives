They include many bug fixes, item changes, dungeon changes, and training cost adjustments; in addition to additional spells and skills for several classes.  <br />
<br />
The Druid Specific changes are as follows:<br />
Training costs adjusted. Total training cost was decreased. <br />
Rebirth - Casting time and mana cost reduced; now ignores resurrection timers. <br />
Swiftshifting - Talent changed. When leaving a shapeshift form, the next shapeshift form you take will have a 20%/40%/60% mana cost reduction if used within 6 seconds. <br />
Gift of the Wild - This spell is now cast on the target's party. <br />
Cat Form - DPS increase at levels 40-60. <br />
New Ability (Cat Form): Ferocious Bite (available at level 32) - Finishing move that causes damage per combo point and converts each extra point of energy into additional damage. <br />
New Spell: Barkskin (available at level 44) - The druid's skin becomes as tough as bark. Physical damage taken is reduced. While protected, taking damage will not cause spellcasting delays, but non-instant spells take longer to cast and melee combat is slowed. <br />
New Ability (Bear Form): Frenzied Regeneration (available at level 36) - Converts an amount of rage into health every second for a short duration. <br />
<br />
