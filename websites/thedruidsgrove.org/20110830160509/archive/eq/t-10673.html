Well some of them. I wanted to know the difference between &quot;Fury of Ro&quot; and &quot;Improved Damage 4&quot;<br />

Is there a site that explains these limits? Or a place on Lucy that does? <br />
<br />
I have no real idea which of these I'd rather have =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">01-29-2005, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main difference between these two is this:<br />
<br />
First of all, Fury of Ro is a +30%, whereas ID4 is +20%. (That is the increase spell damage by xxxxx line).<br />
<br />
Next is Limit Max Level: xxx. This is the max level of which spells will be effected by the focus. For ID4 no spells over level 65 will be fully focus'd, whereas using fury of ro no spells over level 67 will be fully focus'd.<br />
<br />
Limit: Instant Spells only. This is for nukes, or direct damage spells. Any spell that isn't a dot and does damage.<br />
<br />
Limit: Target(Area around target excluded) and Limit: Target(Area around caster excluded), prevent PBAoE's (upheavel etc) and Targeted AoE's (karanas rage etc) to be focus'd by this item, so they wouldn't get any bonus on damage.<br />
<br />
Limit: Resist(Fire allowed). This means that only fire based DD's will be affected by this focus (fury of ro). Wheras ID4 can be used on any nuke resist type whatsoever, fury of ro can only be used on fire.<br />
<br />
When buying damage focii, the question you should ask is...what do I nuke with most? Can I get a seperate focus for cold/fire?...this is key, since they are really our only nukes that need focusing, and most of the time an all around focus (id4) will be a lower % than a specialized focus (fury of ro).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, if not let me know and I'll try to clarify it more when im awake!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye - was faster since I had it up already. But didn't notice it wasn't linking to Lucy. Looked the same at the time but I see it's not. <br />
<br />
So I take it that means don't worry about them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">02-02-2005, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, it means look at lucy for spell info, not magelo.</div></div><hr />
