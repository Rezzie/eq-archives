<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitty Ember</div><div class="date">05-06-2006, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, hello to all of you.<br />
 <br />
A bit of a strange question here, so I'll give you a little backstory. I played EQ from Kunark era to early PoP, then spent the time until just before PoR paying but not playing. In that time, I levelled my druid to 55 and need only Fay and corrupted seahorse to get my epic.<br />
 <br />
But when I came back to the game I decided to start over. I've levelled a new druid to 50 (almost 51 as of right now) got her better equipment than the old druid ever had, and really want the epic on her.<br />
 <br />
So my question is this: is it possible to MQ the final epic turn-in? Give the elaborate scimitar, Faydwer and Kunark spirits with one druid, and then give Antonica spirit with the other and get epic with her? For that matter, is it even possible to get the Antonica spirit without having done the scimmy rigamarole? I see it being pretty easy to get a couple people to help out with Fay, and should be able to gather up a couple to help me get the Kedge piece so I can finish my spirits on druid #1, but if I can't MQ it, it's really not of much consequence to me to finish it, because this druid is retired as of now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sippin</div><div class="date">05-07-2006, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's an interesting question. Considering that the original epic 1.0's were coded in the days when MQ worked &quot;most of the time&quot;, one would think it would work. Plus now most NPCs return items if they won't accept them.<br />
<br />
But, given also how much work it is to do parts of epic quests I wouldn't want to chance the NPC &quot;eating&quot; your stuff.<br />
<br />
Probably easier to redo the entire quest from scratch, especially if you have some high-level friends. Most level 70s could probably solo-kill every mob for you.</div></div><hr />

So, if all you need is a couple of kills to get the last pieces, I'd give it a try.<br />
<br />
BTW, a 70 druid can definitely solo every mob in the quest, so you don't need a whole lot of help.  One kind (high-level) soul should be enough.<br />
<br />
Good luck with this.  I loved the leaf-blower.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitty Ember</div><div class="date">05-07-2006, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. Yeah, I just need the two kills for the old druid to get the cleanses spirits and need to kill the goblin for the piece I still need for Antonica. I figure if it doesn't work I'll redo it.</div></div><hr />
