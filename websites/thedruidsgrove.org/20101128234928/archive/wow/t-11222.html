Really fun fight.  Then we got to the second boss (not Sartura, the other one... bug with two other bugs), and wiped 4 times before calling it.  <br />
<br />
I got Honored with CC after that run, and went and picked up the +15NR to cloak enchant.  (considering crafting another Hide of the Wild to put 15NR on..)  I've been told that people should have a minimum of 100NR to be effective in AQ40.  Other than that really nice NR ring that is a quest reward in Silithus, what are some other good NR pieces that Druids can quest / get crafted?  I'm currently at 74 buffed with iMoTW atm.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I'm concerned, druids don't need NR for almost any boss fight in AQ40.<br />
<br />
For the bug family, I go in with myself set to decurse priority, and just do my heals as usual. I'm not sure how it works on Alliance side, but we let the shamans drop their poison cleansing totems, and remove poison (more efficient mana cost for them). Druids help on poison removal, but mostly heals the raid etc etc.<br />
<br />
For Huhuran, only the 15(mebbe less now?) closest targets needs NR and NR pots. The rest of us will not get hit. When we do get hit, it's probably game over by then. ;)<br />
<br />
Twin Emps... we don't need NR. Frost and Fire pots ftw. ;)<br />
<br />
Ouro... I think we'll need a bit of NR here, but he's an optional boss. We skipped him to work on C'thun, and then Naxx came out shortly after we dropped C'thun.<br />
<br />
C'thun... I stopped using NR, although it helps a bit for low health ppl. Basically, if you have enuff HP to take a double eyebeam without any NR, than you know you're fine.<br />
<br />
Don't need NR for Skeram, Satura and Fankriss.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about Viscidus though, because my guild skipped him, since he's kinda pointless.<br />
<br />
So ya, that's what I do in AQ40 as a druid. The melee classes are the ones who needs NR the most, not us. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, and there is a quest to pickup the Cenarion Reservist Leggings. Look up the pre-req quests to obtain it on Thottbot or something. Everyone should get it done at the same time, then summon the raid level boss together to complete the quest. The rest of the NR stuff, you can obtain from Maraudon, if you still want NR.<br />
<br />
There's also a quest in Silithius to get a green pendant with like 8NR. It's soloable, and you get the item in your mail. I fergot the quest line to get it though. :O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alphyratz</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Visc is the only fight you would ever need NR on, and even on that fight, if you do it right, you won't need any. All of Ouro's attacks that are nature based can be avoided (again, with proper positioning), and for Huhu, if you're eating her AE, you're doing something wrong :p. For the bug trio, NR won't really matter, its not that hard to heal through the AE.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you're a feral druid, that all changes, and you'll likely need 200~ unbuffed NR (for sponging on Huhu and surviving Ouro/Visc AEs, and I *think* the pre-TwinEmps trash, for thorns).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like others have said, you don't need much NR unless you're a soaker on Huhuran (it's still the 15 closest, btw). If you are (like me) in melee on that fight, you'll need a lot of NR.<br />
<br />
First, there are some few pieces that drop off the royal trio, Skeram and (I think?) Sartura, that ups your NR considerably. In addition to the other stuff mentioned earlier in the thread, you can also craft the Bramblewood items (from CC), and also the cloth items (from CC) if you don't care about armour (i.e. if you're not tanking).<br />
<br />
Other decent items:<br />
- Gloves from the trees in DM west, hard to grind for, but boe, so they occationally pop up on the AH. Expensive.<br />
- Gloves from the spider boss in RFD, if you're not able to get the ones from DM west.<br />
- Pythonskin shoulders and trinket from Maraudon (Razorlash and Noxxion respectively).<br />
- Smoking heart of the mountain if you're enchanter (if not, get another trinket from Noxxion).</div></div><hr />

I hit 265 unbuffed NR ( which actually is a tad to high since we technically need 300 buffed ).  If you click my ctprofiles you will see my NR items.  <br />
<br />
But if you're a healer then you won't need nearly as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smartidiot</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, exactly.  Druid != Healer guys.<br />
<br />
If you are healing or casting, you don't need too much NR.<br />
<br />
If you gonna cat DPS or tank, you will need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-26-2006, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool thanks for the info guys.  I'm not in an AQ40 raiding guild yet (were still struggling in BWL &gt;&lt;), but have friends who are that occasionally need an extra druid, so I wanted to be prepared the best I can.  I've only seen two fights, but they were SUPER fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we're only upto fankriss in aq40 atm and so far i dont wear any of my NR gear tbh. nor do any other druids.<br />
<br />
got 292 unbuffed as well all ready to rock and roll when needed.<br />
<br />
Another ring to aim for is the Band of Cenarius from killing dukes etc in Silithus and handing in the Abyssal Scepter ?  19 NR and 10Sta iirc ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackehorn</div><div class="date">11-09-2006, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You actually only need 265ish and I have noticed it helps me live longer changing out from my normal NR to more sta gear.   With the totem it brings you above the 300 mark rule.  At least that is what my guild lives by with our MT research god at the helm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bix</div><div class="date">11-10-2006, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As the other said, NR isn't so important for us. However, here is some additional info : <br />
<br />
- The Calling (http://www.wowwiki.com/Quest:The_Calling) quest chain .. Check also the thottbot topic (http://www.thottbot.com/?ccb=1&amp;v=215084) about it . Rewards are some nice NR legs (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=52128) AND cool boots (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=52052).<br />
<br />
- For the Band of Cenarius (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=53523) Khelgar mentioned here, you need to turn-in an Abyssal Scepter from a Silithus Lord (20-30man raid target for reasonably equipped raid). You need revered reputation with Cenarion Circle to summon them, plus a lot of expensive or hard to get summoning components. But the good thing is you can collect/buy all the stuff and have someone else summon the Lord, and then loot the Scepter yourself (which, moreover, is not BoP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-14-2006, 04:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed - the Abyssal Scepters often get sold on the AH for around 200g-250g on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends what role you play in your guild.  I play the OSB role and quite well.  If you are allowed to be feral then you will need 260ish+   As a healer you won't but even if you are healer spec and can reach 260+ then you can be part of the nature wall on huhu without any problems.</div></div><hr />
