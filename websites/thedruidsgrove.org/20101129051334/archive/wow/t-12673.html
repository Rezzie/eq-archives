If so, you will have to re-earn your rating before you can buy them as every toon (and team) will get reset to 1500 when S4 is released.<br />
<br />
Though I guess you could buy S3 without issue.  I wonder if the S3 shoulders will loose their 2000 personal rating requirement?</div></div><hr />

*edit:  S3 that is.  S4 has its own weird ratings tier, with the shoulders requiring the highest arena rating at like 2150 or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
but if they DO, imma be pissed! better have all your BG marks saved up... im sitting on about 40,000 honor and 90-100 marks from each bg...<br />
<br />
I may go ahead and spend it on the vindicator's stuff for healers ahead of time, and then grind for the S2 mace and shoulders for my feral set... &lt;sigh&gt; it looks like i'll be going resto or dreamstate healing for my 3's team... Blizz needs to release a bag with more slots<br />

Is S3 the same look as T6? If so, I really prefer S3/T6 to the new S4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, S3 is the same as T6... those shoulders look just plain ol UGLY and the look all together looks way too voodoo/hippyish for my taste... lol</div></div><hr />

That's one of my biggest complaints about how blizzard is doing things now. They are so concerned about pleasing the masses that this game is losing it's identity. I have no problem with putting in new ways for people to gear up (raiding/arena/battlegrounds/heroic badges), but why does the gear have to look the same? What's wrong with making gear look different?</div></div><hr />

Especially from Druids who spend 99% looking like a tree, bear, cat or a weird chicken.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I never really look at my toon other than when I'm sitting at the login screen.  He could be a big green arrow and I'd be happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
S4 is a trainwreck though.  I wouldn't mind all of the sets of the same armour class looking similar if they actually looked good.  S4 is by far the ugliest set to be released by Blizzard.  Ever.</div></div><hr />
