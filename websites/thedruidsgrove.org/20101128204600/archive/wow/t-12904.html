<br />
Let me know your thoughts and suggestions.<br />
<br />
Here are my thoughts for Feral Spec at lvl 70 after patch 3.0.2:<br />
<br />
5/5 Ferocity - Obviously this reduces the rage cost of all of our attacks.<br />
<br />
3/3 Feral Instincts - Many are sacrificing here, but I want to make sure to increase my swipe dmg to max so that my TPS on multiple mobs is high enough to keep aggro.<br />
<br />
2/2 Savage Fury - +dmg to mangle...self explanatory<br />
<br />
3/3 Thick Armor - +armor…good<br />
<br />
2/2 Feral Swiftness - +4% dodge is a must…and + movement speed in kitty is a nice perk<br />
<br />
1/1 Survival Instinct – Oh shizzle button – Anyone else planning to macro this with Frenzied Regen and Trinkets?<br />
<br />
3/3 Sharpened Claws - +6% crit is nice in both kitty and bear.<br />
<br />
3/3 Predatory Strike - +AP is always important for any feral<br />
<br />
2/2 Primal Fury – Extra rage just for beating the junk out of something…I likes<br />
<br />
2/2 Primal Precision - +Expertise is a must, and refunded energy is a nice perk<br />
<br />
1/1 Feral Charge – Must have for bear tank + new kitty version<br />
<br />
3/3 Natural Reaction - +6% dodge and +rage for each dodge.  This will really help FR when trinkets are popped.<br />
<br />
5/5 Heart of the Wild - +20% stam…enough said.<br />
<br />
2/3 Survival of the Fittest – I saved a point here because all of my gear has enough defense to make up the 1.6% defense gap left to make the bear uncrittable.  As long as the gear still have +def on it, I think this talent will be flexible.<br />
<br />
1/1 Leader of the Pack - +crit for all...good<br />
<br />
2/2 Imp LotP -  +health for hitting extra hard…better<br />
<br />
3/3 Protector of the Pack - +AP and –dmg taken per party member is a must with the armor reduction.<br />
<br />
3/3 Predatory Instincts - +crit dmg given , -AOE dmg taken.  This talent seems to be skipped a lot by builds I have seen suggested, but every raid boss seems to do some AOE dmg, so I think the mitigation will be helpful here.<br />
<br />
3/3 Infected Wounds – This talent is skipped by almost all bear builds in favor of allowing some Resto tree talents.  I think that -10% attack speed is being overlooked and seems like a pretty key mitigation tool.  <br />
<br />
1/1 Mangle – Yes please!<br />
<br />
3/3 Imp Mangle – Many are shorting this talent in favor of “Naturalist” in the resto tree but paired with IW &amp; Berserk this talent will be far more important. <br />
<br />
5/5 Rend &amp; Tear – This talent is being skipped by many to favor the “Naturalist” and “Shapeshifter” abilities.  From what I hear from beta Maul is the new lacerate, so this talent increases the maul dmg by a ton.  Only thing is, the target must be bleeding, that being said what target isn’t in raid???<br />
<br />
1/1 Berserk – Again many are skipping this talent so that they can get into the resto tree, but I think this is hands down the crème de le crème of the bear abilities.  Uber TPS boost shortly after the pull along with stacking things like IW on the target.  MUST HAVE NOW!!!!<br />
<br />
2/2 Imp MotW – had some points left and MotW point for point is the best bonus.  Chances are any other druid in raid would have it, but I hate to leave a couple hundred armor and some dmg/dodge on the table.</div></div><hr />

I prefer to be prepared and have all the untility talents I can get as a tank, instead of assuming (hoping lol) that someone else in the raid will have what I lack.  You sacrifice a little kitty dps without OoC, but for a bear spec I think you are right on.<br />
<br />
As of right now unless something changes, I will be 0/69/2 come level 80 for my bear spec.</div></div><hr />

The last 2 PTR builds still mentioned bear even though a blue post said it was cat only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is still kitty only, but it's useful when you need to go cat mid-fight or mid-raid, at least until they implement dual specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Understood, but you mentioned not taking OoC which is the primo cat talent, so I assumed you were focusing on a pure tank build.  But, then, if you don't take a single point in resto you have plenty to &quot;waste&quot; in Feral.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd take King of the Jungle over PI.  KotJ is a really nice cat dps talent, plus it has a minor benefit to bears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-14-2008, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice!<br />
<br />
BTW the current tooltip shows PI helping all feral forms...not sure which source is out of date.   Blizz sight is down atm, so I can't checki with them....guess we will know soon enough!<br />
<br />
Thanks again!!!<br />
