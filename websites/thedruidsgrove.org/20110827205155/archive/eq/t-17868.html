I played EQ from 1999 thru 2006 and went to WoW, I was a diehard PvP/Battleground freak in WoW. But I miss my childhood days of EQ.<br />
I plan to create a second account, create that Dark Elf Necro I always wanted, and head to the original zones. I still have my manastone. <br />
I recall sitting in Oasis (now new zone I hear) waiting 8 minutes between kills to med, and listening the gentle waves in the early morning hours. I know I will probably be alone in the zone as I go through the Commons, Karanas, Rathe Mountains, etc........but It will bring back the memories. I just don't have the time to level up my 61 Druid, but I will use him to babysit my new Necro. <br />
I hope the tunnel is still around in the old East Commons.......it will be great to just sit there a bit.<br />
WoW just annoys me after 2 years for some reason. Even though dying in EQ is not forgiving like it is in WoW......I miss it all. <br />
I am sure I will hear the echoes of my years back in 1999 thru 2002 when it was really great, the images of old friends running through the zones.<br />
I cannot wait to get back into the game. <br />
Hopefully allakzam will be a helpful site like it is for WoW.</div></div><hr />
