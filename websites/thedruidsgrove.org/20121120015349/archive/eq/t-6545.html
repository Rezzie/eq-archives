<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aquila Swiftspirit</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Fellow Druids,<br />
<br />
I was EAGERLY awaiting this when I hoped it might allow us to take a second specialization to 200, but I'm a bit more hesitant now.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, having the usual specialization at 50 gives me 2-3% less mana use per cast of spells with that specialization.  Having specialization at 200 saves about 10% per cast?  So, having 100 say saves 5% as a guess?<br />
<br />
So, at this point we're looking at 10 AA points to save 2-3% per cast of a specific spell type?<br />
<br />
No doubt, at some point, this AA investment will make good sense to at least some people.  I wouldn't have had any doubts about it if it put a second specialization up to 200, for example; that 7% additional mana savings on a second spell type would have seemed worth the 10 AA.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing, though, that there are some folks with good math reasoning skills who can help me prioritize for me, and that a discussion of this might be helpful to other druids who are or will be thinking about this AA.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I'm level 65, specialized in Alteration.  I do a fair bit if DDing, and was planning to do the duel specialization in evocation.<br />
<br />
I have 160 AA spent now, including scm3, mc2, SCF3, FoM1.  I tend to manage and use my mana so that I always have room to med or heal/DD in groups.  (By that I mean, I tend to stay 60-80 mana in groups, so that I am adding steady dps when that's my job, and always have mana to back up heal, add extra damage, or whatever for a bit.  If I'm primary healing and have extra mana, I add dps to keep my medding meaningful.  In raids, I usually have mana to spare, since DDing too fast/much gets agro badly.)<br />
<br />
Adding duel specialization in evocation would save mana, especially some mana for DDing (though, of course, the saved mana could also be used for other stuff).<br />
<br />
Assuming, for a moment, that I could use the saved mana to DD, would I be better off buying, say, FoM2, and FoM3 (6 and 9 points respectively, for 15 total points), or even mc3 (faster mana regen, 6 points), than spending those 10 points to gain 2-3% savings on evocation spells?<br />
<br />
At this point, I seem to recall that FoM increases the likelihood of getting a crit DD by 2% per level?  So in damage output, that seems a little better than saving 2-3% mana per crit.  (For a 300 mana DD, it would take what, 100 DDs cast to save mana for another?  In contrast, I'd have to cast on average 50 times to get that extra crit with FoM2?)<br />
<br />
(As I consider mc3, it helps to know that I have ft15, mask of the forest, and p9/b9 all the time, and usually KEI or VoQ when it matters).<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me think this through.<br />
<br />
(ps.  Dear Mods: if this should have been in the AA area rather than the new expansions area, please feel free to move it.  I put it here because GoD isn't live or, so far as I know, completely set yet.  Thanks!)</div></div><hr />

Yes, an added 50 specialization skill will save you an extra 3%; yes, it's not much; and yes, virtually all of the Luclin and PoP AAs are superior in terms of bang for the AA buck, so get them first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">02-04-2004, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The lure of Secondary Forte is its wider scope than Casting Fury.  Specifically, it works with spells like Hand of Ro and Immolation of Ro (or, for you Evocation druids, it works with Tunare's and Karana's Renewal where HG doesn't.)<br />
<br />
Comparing it to Casting Fury, I'd put it between FoMM1 and FoMM2.  I believe the FoMM line costs 4, 8 and 12 points.  If each level provides a 2% increased chance of a crit, 4 AA for a ~2% DPM* boost is the best purchase, but 2nd Spec's 3% mana savings for 10 AA is a better purchase than FoMM2.<br />
<br />
* Comparing an increase in crit % to an increase in mana preservation cannot be done properly without considering a number of variables.  The general form for damage per mana includes:<br />
<br />
Base Damage*(1 + Expected Crit % + Focus %: (Max % + .01)/2 + Song %: .08)<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Base Manacost*(1 - Specialization % - SCM % - Mana Pres Focus %: (Max % + .01)/2)<br />
<br />
I'm defining marginal dpm as (DPM with New AA) / (DPM without).  If you don't like math, &quot;marginal dpm&quot; = &quot;bang&quot;.<br />
<br />
With a few assumptions about the variables above, we can calculate marginal dpm for the AAs in question.  For these examples, I've used the following:  Alteration Primary specialization, SCM3 trained, FoM3 trained, no bard song.  It turns out that the damage focus and mana preservation focus both affect the marginal dpm.<br />
<br />
Marginal dpm for a 2% crit increase, as a function of damage focus<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
0 focus: 1.74%<br />
ID4(10.5% focus): 1.59% <br />
Wrath (18% focus): 1.5%<br />
<br />
Marginal dpm for a 3% preservation benefit, as a function of mana preservation<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
0 mana pres:3.57% <br />
MP4 (5.5% mana pres): 3.82%<br />
Summer's Vengeance (13% mana pres on SF): 4.23%<br />
<br />
Now to compare the AAs, we want &quot;bang for your buck&quot;: <br />
I've assumed Improved Damage IV, and Mana Pres 4<br />
Points = 100 * Marginal DPM / AA cost<br />
<br />
FoMM1 2% crits for 4 aa: 39.75 points<br />
FoMM2 2% crits for 8 aa: 19.875 points<br />
FoMM3 2% crits for 12 aa: 13.25 points<br />
2nd Forte 3% manapres for 15 AA: 25.5 points<br />
<br />
As it turns out, 2nd Forte is very close to FoMM1.  All things considered, I'll probably get 2nd Forte before FoMM1 because of the benefits on debuffs and dots.<br />
<br />
Well, the updated version of 2nd Forte still sits between FoMM1 and FoMM2 when you're comparing adjustments to dpm.  At 15 AA points it becomes more of a luxury purchase, in the same league as FoMM2 and FoM3.  I'll definitely get FoMM1 first now.</div></div><hr />

I think in the long run, for 10AA, Secondary Forte is a lot of bang for the buck<br />

<br />
<br />
Sil, what on earth are you talking about?<br />
<br />
First, there is no extra 150 points in spec.  There's only 50, because we are at 50 right now and Secondary Forte lifts that to 100 (not 200).  The end result of that is a 2.5% to 3% mana savings for that line.<br />
<br />
Second, SCM already applies to all our spells.  The mana savings is constant for a particular SCM level, and is independent of spec level.   If you think that SCM has something to do with a &quot;spec check,&quot; you're being mislead by the ingame description of SCM, which is not accurate (and has not been accurate for years).<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether you think 2.5% to 3% mana preservation in one spell line is worth 10 AA, no one can call that a &quot;lot of bang for the buck&quot; with a straight face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the GoD AA's arent set up to be superior to the PoP/Luclin AA's, but rather are a progression from them.<br />
<br />
10 AA may not be much &quot;bang for the buck&quot; compared to SCM, but all you have left to compare it to are things like innate int, its a supernova for the buck.</div></div><hr />

In other words, they suck, but it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick?</div></div><hr />

Also mentioned after chat was over: <br />
<br />
Rbarker - Secondary Forte actually translates into a decent mana savings for that set of spells. I wouldn't write it off as worthless.<br />
  <br />
<br />
Beside this statement (which you can take or leave) there is the fact that no one is being forced to buy this AA.  If you want it and have the AA, get it, if not then spend your AA elsewhere.<br />
<br />
What cracks me up is that they basically reduced this ability to 1/3rd of its former power (150 to 50). Was the cost reduced to 1/3rd?  <br />
<br />
Isn't that the whole point of putting this on TEST first?  If they deem that it is too powerful as is they adjust it accordingly.<br />
<br />
I, for one, will be happy to have any extra mana savings on a second line of spells (evocation in my case) and while 10 AA may be a fairly high cost I look at it that it is only a one time cost that will benefit me for a long time to come.</div></div><hr />

I'd pay 15aap for 2nd forte in a instant if it gave me 200 skill. I'd pay the 30 aap for Crit affliction if it gave me a 13-14% chance to crit or 60 aap for Natures Boon 5 if it actually was benefitial to me. As it stands not only do 90% of our aap just plain suck, but we are being charged 2-3-4x their value too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello RBarker... we've done the numbers.  2-3% on a set of spells that arent even the set that you cast the most of is NOT a &quot;decent&quot; overall savings.<br />
<br />
The savings the playerbase gets from not purchasing GoD however is more significant.</div></div><hr />

Its a great aa ability but its one we should have already been given when almost every other caster got it.  Even SKs got scs with PoP (I think it was PoP), when would an SK possibly want less aggro from their spells.</div></div><hr />
