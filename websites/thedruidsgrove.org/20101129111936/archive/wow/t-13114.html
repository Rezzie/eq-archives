I get the error message &quot;A more powerful spell is in place&quot;.  Has anyone else seen that?  I wonder if it is because a trinket fired while I cast it?<br />

I haven't seen this happen for Regrowth or lifebloom, which I would assume if it was the trinket it should happen.</div></div><hr />

Ferals had a similar problem with FFF.  And it wasn't just from Moonkins casting imp FF.  Turned out to be some other classes' buff (mage? Warlock?) was causing the first FFF to be &quot;improved&quot; but when the other FFF was applied the buff wasn't up so the new FFF failed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen it on my brief forays into Wrath healing, only done 5 man instances so far.  I've been moved back to the huntard for raiding so I've not looked into the healing mechanics in wrath too much, but our priestly healing expert did say something about Spirit now contributing [more] to healing (at least I think it was spirit). If that is the case, I'm still using the cloth Kara robes that proc a big spirit increase from time to time and I'm just wondering &quot;aloud&quot; whether the potential boost to healing from that or perhaps a.n other trinket on your existing Rejuve might be preventing a refreshed rejuve from being applied though I'm not sure why that wouldn't also apply to lifebloom. I'm assuming Regrowth wouldn't be affected because of the initial Direct heal portion of the cast.</div></div><hr />

That's a good thought, I do have a periodic proc spirit trinket equipped.  That would explain the rejuv, but not entangling roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It isn't due to trinkets.  I've tested and retested that theory.  I can overwrite my own rejuv most of the time, even if the trinket proc'd when I first cast it.  Just every now and then I can't.  <br />
<br />
Whatever the problem is, it seems to work the same was as entangling roots issue does.  Kind of random.</div></div><hr />
