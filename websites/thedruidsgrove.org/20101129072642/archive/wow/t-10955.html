Mainly because I'm currently on dial up and therefore dont fair well at all in group PVPs...However, when I move into my college dorm in a few days, I'll have high speed internet and will be looking forward to more group PVPs ^_^.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know Druids excel quite well in solo PVP, but I'm just curious as to how Druids are when in group PVPs, particularly in BGs and PVP Raids.<br />
<br />
I know we aren't the best most likely, and I'm more interested in how Balance/Feral druids perform since Resto druids will be useful no matter what if they just heal. <br />
<br />
Any tips or strategies would be helpful too, thanks everyone ^_^!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as feral goes, It is very useful in group pvp.  Your versatility allows you to adapt to a variety of situations:<br />
<br />
Getting the flag out of the flag room with your group healing you in bear form for high hp and armor<br />
<br />
Rooting adds on your flag carrier in between your heals (yes you can still heal as feral spec)<br />
<br />
Double teaming opposing teams flag carrier with a stunlock rogue...<br />
<br />
Ninja capping points in AB....<br />
<br />
Stealth is always useful, even if used in a healing role.<br />
<br />
and if need be your shifting/speed can get you out of a sticky situation with the flag in wsg and back to where your support can to just that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">08-16-2006, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love group PvP in moonkin, especially in AV.<br />
<br />
However, most people don't want to hear about AV, they just accept range is a big edge there.  In WSG I love to stand stealthed midfield and root flag runners as they come straight for me, its also handy to be able to fall in behind a flag runner and just keep dropping MFs on him as you both run, no one survives long.  In AB I am a great node defender whipping out the roots and long bombs from the bushes.<br />
<br />
As balance, I feel it is my duty to help with the cc, and FF all rogues.  I also try to focus on the targets I am strongest against (warriors), while others take care of the ones I am weakest against (casters).  Moonkin form itself isn't terribly helpful, as I mostly PuG it and my group doesn't stick together on the field, but it is the only known AoE PvP taunt, which can be handy in itself (exaggerating slightly on the taunt, but you will have people coming for you breaking their own lines which can be used to strategic advantage).</div></div><hr />

It is amazing the reaction I get when I heal a warrior in AB. Once they realize who is healing them I am almost guaranteed a bodyguard for the match. The best pair up I had was a Pally guildie and I guarding nodes in AB. We were a hard pair to bring down :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you think the best match-ups will be?  How well do you see druids fitting in 2 or 3 man groups?  Will 5 druids n one team be a good idea?</div></div><hr />

Yeah Swearword!  Resto BG luv.  I'm still jazzed on the absolute slaughter that a pally and I handed to 4 pretty well geared horde in AB a few weeks ago.  I just stood in the bushes at the mine, healed him, Rooted a warrior, and watched him decimate three other hordies who apparently didnt notice me, then we both took down the warrior.  He was full t2 with the destroyer of worlds sword, which just made it that much cooler.  <br />
<br />
I had a really fun world pvp experience a couple nights ago with a rogue friend.  We would stealth into a town, slay this 60 hunter:  simeltaneous ambush/ravage, couple more quick hits, then sprint / dash out of the town, stealth, and come back in the other side.  We harassed him in this way for a while, as more and more people kept coming from both sides, and eventually started a war between Tarren Mill and Southshore.  So many fun druid pvp stories.</div></div><hr />

That is almost exactly what happened with me that made me so happy. The great part was another horde came in at the end thinking he would take me out since I was about out of mana. So I just shifted bear and the pally healed me when I needed it:)</div></div><hr />
