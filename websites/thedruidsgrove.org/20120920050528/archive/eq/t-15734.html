I cast it and get no message, no buff icon, or short duration buff icon.  The hotkey does grey out though.  If I let a mob hit me, I don't see a damage shield report (all filters are off), and I don't see its hp go down.  At first I thought it was because I didn't have an existing damage shield buff, so I threw on Needlecoat, but it didn't matter.<br />

Abundant Healing (Rank 1): I have yet to see this go off after a few hundred casts.  I typically use the lvl 60 direct healing spell (Nature's Recovery?) to top off my tank in my boxing duo and Karana's Renewal for the heavy duty healing, but I have yet to see AH kick in on Nature's Recovery.  It's supposed to meet the min level req for AH of 60.  Is there a message you see?  Is there an icon and which buff box does it go to?</div></div><hr />

You target yourself (or your tank) and click the AA.  You get a buff in your buff bar called Wrath of the Wild, which should hit for 300 Damage, and fade after one hit.  If your casting it on the mob, it won't do anything, but will grey out.  I would make sure of your target and test it in a non-combat situation.<br />

At rank 1, your chance to proc Abundant Healing is very low (less then 2% likely since max chance is only 9%).  I have AH5, but I confirmed it does indeed proc on Nature's Touch.<br />

The Heal Over Time effect goes to the short buff box, and the message is: Someone  is covered in a soft healing light.<br />
