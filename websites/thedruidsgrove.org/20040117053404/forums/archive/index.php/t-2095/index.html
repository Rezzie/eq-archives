<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SuburbanLife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Topic pretty much says it all.  I was wondering some ideal solo spots for soloing if possible in Fire or any of the other elementals.  Any help would be very appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqduffer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I recommend quadding at air zone in.  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Matafleur Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What do you quad, Duffer? I was under the impression that the mobs in air summoned.<br />
<br />
The picnic tables at 2nd castle (aka Fennin Castle) in PoFire is great exp. Quaddable and plenty of room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm there is no way you can quad at air zone in. Pathing is very screwy and mobs have a tons of hp and spawns adds when killed. Not to mention they also summon and blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm guessing he was kidding about quadding at the air zone in. :P</div></div><hr />

Right past the CoH spot in Plane of Fire where the two Birds spawn is a great xp spot as well. It's a SOLO Spot, not a bring a couple bots because there are Enchanter mobs there that will cast Dicate on you and charm you. If you're by yourself it's no biggie, just wait til charm is off then resume killing. If others are there you get sent on them. You can root/rot or if Birds are not up you can just kite and nuke. <br />
<br />
Also, if birds are not up and you're up for a good challenge you can solo the Magma Guardians (Big Lava guys). They dont' summon but take awhile to kill. I was getting 22-24% per kill for them. No cool drops off them that I've seen but great xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The magma guardians are the only mobs that drop solidified magma, right?  (That's what I remember from eqtraders at least, before they switched to the database...there was a page that listed where each of the PoP tradeskill components drop.  I miss that page!)<br />
<br />
In any case, if so, the solidified magma is the hard part to get for the ceramic incense burner of ro.</div></div><hr />
