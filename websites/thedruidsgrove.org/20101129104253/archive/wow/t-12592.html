<br />
How many of you guys seriously pursue spirit as a main stat (sacrificing healing or more regen for spirit) in 2.4?  Is this a personal choice, or have you been asked to do this by your guild?<br />
<br />
I typically have 604 (flask) or 640 (elixir) spirit raid buffed.  I know I could squeeze out more (using a staff with 22 spirit on it instead of mace and OH, regemming all of my blue/purple gems), but is it worth it?<br />
<br />
Input would be appreciated, especially from you raiding restos out there ... :)</div></div><hr />

Once I reached the 2k +heal mark, I started using spirit gems and looking for gear to improve my spirit.  I try to keep my +heal right around 2k (I go from 2005 down to 1995 and back up).<br />

Right now I'm at 566 spirit and 1995 +heal.<br />
<br />
Why do I do this?  Well I started noticing that my actual lifebloom ticks weren't increasing exponentially as I added +heal (heh, obvious eh?) but by adding Spirit I was increasing both my mp5 and the +healing granted by the ToL aura.<br />
<br />
Being in the MT group every raid, since I'm the only full-time Resto Druid in my guild, was also a good reason to do this.  Improving the +heal of all healers in the raid is very helpful.<br />
<br />
And to be totally honest, you can never have enough mp5.  Try using every global cooldown with 3x Lifebloom and 1x Rejuvenation (with the right latency 4x LB, 1x Rejuv) and see how long your mana lasts.  Can you do it for an entire boss fight using Innervate and pots?</div></div><hr />
