When my warrior friend using my same computer does not have this on her screen. Does anyone have the quest progress visible on screen at all times while doing quest? Why would some have it and not others?</div></div><hr />

You can manually track quests by opening your Quest Log, then shift-clicking a quest.  If you want to turn automatic tracking on/off, go into the Interface Options page; it's in there somewhere.<br />
