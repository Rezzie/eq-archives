<br />
personally i just do 5x mangle (cat) until i got 5 combo points then dish out a rip. rinse &amp; repeat.<br />
<br />
however it doesnt really turn out to be good enough (DPS chart shows im bottom)<br />
<br />
i've seen the debate regarding powershifting with furor for the extra 40 energy, but im not really convinced to do that since i am always involved in rebirthing and innervating raid members halfway throughout the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shred is the most damage for the energy.  You need to have 2/2 Shredding Attacks in order for this to work:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  When the tank pulls, be a good cat and wait a bit for aggro.<br />
<br />
2.  Faerie Fire while waiting.<br />
<br />
3.  Mangle!<br />
<br />
4.  Now Shred until you have built up 5 combo points.<br />
<br />
5.  Wait until you have 70-80 energy, then Rip.<br />
<br />
6.  _Immedietely_ do a Mangle - if you do it within 2 seconds the first tick of Rip will be amplified by Mangle.<br />
<br />
7.  Now build up 5 Combo Points again by Shredding, return to step 5..<br />

Last night in Kara:<br />
<br />
1. After the tank pulls Prince, tag with Faerie Fire<br />
<br />
2. Tank Prince in kitty form until tank regains aggro.<br />
<br />
Make sure the tank has aggro before casting FFF...</div></div><hr />

<br />
FFF, Mangle, Mangle, Rip, FB (this did some amazing damage, but its been nerfed since I tried it) and usually the mob was dead, but either way there are a lot of other abilities that you can use now that pretty much change the rotations a good bit.</div></div><hr />

Hello new druid!! :D<br />
<br />
Welcome to our Druid's Grove :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
You know, even if you keep Mangle up, the energy spent to Pounce works out as poorer efficiency than just going straight into the rotation I posted above :&gt;  We had a big discussion about the best rotations and theorycrafted through them all some moons ago.  Pretty sure that's what we concluded..<br />

But I open up with FFF (which starts my white attacks).  I, then, wait (doing just white damage) for a few seconds so the tank can build up some threat.  Then I start the Mangle, Shred to 5CP, Rip, repeat sequence.  If I start to pull agro (from too many crits), I just do white damage for a moment and reset FFF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, it's best to start with FFF(?)  <br />
<br />
I've been starting with pounce.....(but ya, it does suck up  energy)....and when do you use shred?  <br />
<br />
I actually forgot how to be a kitty, I've been resto for so long.  I'm out of practice.<br />
<br />
And if I may ask yet another noob question:<br />
<br />
Mangle to 4/5 combo<br />
<br />
What does that mean?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-23-2008, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.... you build combo points as a kitty just like a rogue.  What 4/5 combo means is use mangle to build to 4 or 5 combo points and then do your finishing move.<br />
<br />
For the FFF question I use it above pounce for two reasons:<br />
1.  Energy Efficiency.<br />
2.  Pull positioning -&gt; In other words I like to pull the mob to where I want it and not find out that I stupidly put myself behind the mob and thus too close to the next mob.</div></div><hr />

In raids/instances, I find that pouncing is a waste of time.  Also stunning a mob makes it difficult for the tank to gain rage/threat at the beginning.  <br />
<br />
If you are questing or something and need to kill some mobs, it can be pretty beneficial to pounce/mangle/shred because usually the mobs are dead before pounce breaks if you time it right.<br />
<br />
In raids though, it's better to just toss up a FFF, then Mangle/Shred/Rip.  At the moment, the damage from FB doesn't really make up for the energy dump that it involves.</div></div><hr />

Ya...questing and dailies only.  If I am in a raid I am a Tree.<br />
<br />
I'm studying this thread because it's been so long since I've been a kitty (and I've managed to aquire a decent off-set) I thought it might be fun respec to feral to level to 80.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-23-2008, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I were going to be only grinding mobs as a feral druid, I would spec for Savage Fury and basically get as much stuff as I could to buff Mangle.  Reduced energy, increased damage, the right idol, all that stuff.<br />
<br />
Then, simply run between mobs, FFF as you run towards them, and mangle until they are at 30% health or so, then bite.  Then move to the next mob, FFF as you run towards it... etc<br />
<br />
This is the fastest method of grinding - I am pretty sure about this.  However if you're like me and have talents and gear set up to buff Shred instead (for raid dps), it can sometimes be faster to mangle, maim, shred.<br />

<br />
Generally speaking I agree with you. I sometimes use it in instances with a trash mob that fears or mind controls.....pounce, then all-out dps to kill it before it can cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
since shred is the most damaging skill, why can't we do shred to 5 CP followed by rip with 75 energy so that it becomes FFF&gt;Shred to 5 CP&gt;Rip followed by Mangle.</div></div><hr />

That was removed.  Look at the talent trees again.  Its now shred is buffed when a bleed effect is occuring, but that's not in Mangle anymore.</div></div><hr />

Its now shred is buffed when a bleed effect is occuring, but that's not in Mangle anymore.It is still there, the wording has changed so that a Warrior's Trauma also buffs Shred as well.  The change was made as Trauma overwrites Mangle in the new buff rule scheme, which means we'd lose DPS if a DPS warrior was in the raid.<br />
<br />
Mangle and Trauma are &quot;bleed effect buffs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mangle<br />
&quot;Mangle the target for 160% normal damage plus 507.2 and causes the target to take 30% additional damage from bleed effects for 12 sec. Awards 1 combo point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shred<br />
<br />
&quot;Shred the target, causing 225% damage plus 742.5 to the target. Must be behind the target. Awards 1 combo point. Effects which increase Bleed damage also increase Shred damage.&quot;</div></div><hr />
