<br />
From forums.worldofwarcraft.com (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=1FA2394661AC0EE1B073B730E34  E933D?topicId=174505927&amp;sid=1):<br />
<br />
Druids <br />
&#8226; Cat Form (Night Elf) melee attack range was too short compared to Tauren Cat Form and other attack ranges. It has been increased. <br />
&#8226; Cyclone: It is no longer possible to Cyclone two targets at the same time in the outdoor world. <br />
&#8226; Cyclone: Paladin Auras, Trueshot Aura, and Aspect of the Pack will now be automatically reactivated when Cyclone wears off of a victim who had one of the abilities active. <br />
&#8226; Enrage: If this buff is clicked off early, the armor penalty it causes will now be removed as well. <br />
&#8226; Enrage and Furor should no longer initiate combat, though it will prevent rage decay for the duration. <br />
&#8226; Entangling Roots: It is no longer possible to have Entangling Roots on two targets at the same time in the outdoor world. <br />
&#8226; Entangling Roots: It is no longer possible to have more than one rank of this spell active on a player. <br />
&#8226; Force of Nature: Using this spell in a neutral town will no longer cause its victim to be attacked by town guards. It also will no longer cause nearby party members to lose stealth. <br />
&#8226; Hibernate and Entangling Roots duration against PvP targets has been reduced to 10 seconds. <br />
&#8226; Hurricane: This spell is now affected by area damage caps. Its bonus damage coefficients have also been increased. <br />
&#8226; Hurricane: A tooltip error in rank 3 has been corrected. <br />
&#8226; Lacerate: The damage from this ability will now stack properly when two different characters are applying Lacerate to a target. <br />
&#8226; Mangle: The duration remaining graphic will now display properly for Mangle after it has been refreshed on a target. It will also no longer sometimes apply the Mangle debuff to nearby targets when the Mangle victim is killed by Mangle. <br />
&#8226; Nature's Grasp: This ability can now trigger while the Druid is sitting. <br />
&#8226; Tree of Life: The party aura from this shapeshift now extends the full 40-yard radius as stated in the tooltip.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally they are fixing that damned range bug that has plagued us NE for over a year.<br />
I am not sure how much the 10 second cap on Hibernate and Entangling Roots will affect me. Actually I rarely sleep another Druid, so it may even be positive for me (getting hibernated often).<br />
<br />
All in all a good patch for us Druids. There are a lot of necessary bug fixes in it.</div></div><hr />

Looks like they're doing the right things though.</div></div><hr />

Have you guys ever had that happen?  I'll just said it made for a VERY interesting pull in a Shadow Lab run one time.  I got blamed for pulling too early ( healer mana issues ).  I thought maybe I had pressed the wrong button just as the mob died and I had Faerie Fired or something, but when I saw a mob at 20 yds running at me with the mangle debuff, I knew something was amiss :(.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I'm losing my objectivity, though...after being so excited about being a druid after BC came out, each subsequent patch has been a bit of a let down - like little by little they're letting the air out.  Continuing with that imagery, I felt so deflated about the Hibernate/Roots nerf...<br />
<br />
I know a lot of PvP is skill - I certainly don't claim to be the Best PvP Druid Ever, but I'm not terrible either.   I just keep looking at the tools in my bag and wondering which of them will still be useful after the next patch....</div></div><hr />
