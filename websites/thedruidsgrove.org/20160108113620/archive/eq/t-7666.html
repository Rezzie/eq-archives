<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">scars of velious just owned. so much stuff to do. course I was quading cougars for exp within the first few weeks of release. Velious was just so much fun. I like traveling around it. It was a fun exprience trying to find where our ports were. The constant trips across Kael to pickup teeth to be able to port to wakening lands. Then later go inside skyshrine to camp keys to cobalt scar for guildies as well as guardian armor for them as well.... hey we were true newbies back then.. and guardian armor was one step down from planar. Kunark was pretty fun.. Karnor's was ok lots of trains back then though. Sebilis was just awesome.... although I did hate having to key up guildies one by one. I think I did most of the keys for the server for players lol.. someone was always needing a seb key.<br />
<br />
Original Everquest I loved the karana's especially south karana had alot of fun there. Starting after running after Fabled Mobs to run around to all the old zones for kicks and just killing stuff might make another twink to just run around old zones. Would be nice if they revamped the loot tables allittle to bring players back into these zones, alot of players are just plain missing out on alot of fun in these zones.<br />
<br />
 I just hated Luclin could never really get into it. Was pretty much unplayable to me because of the hours I worked always had a patch or something when I could log on. I never really liked luclin mostly because there is little coherence to the lore and stuff... Basically, it is unfinished to this very day.<br />
<br />
Loy was kinda fun for about 5 minutes. If this expansion would have been released right after luclin or before luclin everyone would have been clamoring out of sebilis and into nadox. Nadox is alot of fun.<br />
<br />
Ldon some nice concepts were introduced, but overall this was not a very fun expansion. To repetitive but then again levels 51-60 were all about repetition. Gates.. I do not like.. mobs hit to darn hard and forces more class imbalances</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaeamdar</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP, by far.  Though as of yet I have not experienced much in GoD.  The raids in PoP are top notch.  First expansion with real puzzels to solve (SoL had some, but not too much).  I also really like the flagging system and progression in PoP, and of course, PoP solidified the move to 3 day spawns, rather than 7.<br />
<br />
LDoN could have been a great expansion, as its raiding content is also really good, but for the inability to add people after the raid starts.  To me, that one thing kills the entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

and the fact that the loot on ldon raids wasn't really worth the effort :)</div></div><hr />

It took me from soloing 99% of the time to grouping 50% of the time. It made my transistion to raiding a lot easier.<br />

Sure it had its own mind numbing time sinks (ie factioning, factioning, factioning) but there was a ton of stuff you could do and almost every zone was open to your exploration. PoP I love and live in mostly, the raid encounters are great but the part where you have to be flagged for zones kinda sucks some of the beauty out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brobin</div><div class="date">08-23-2004, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I loved Kunark, I remember when it came out and exploring all the new zones. First dragons you could see without dying too. :)<br />
<br />
Even after Velious came out I spent more time in Kunark. I loved quading in BW. I loved fighting giants, even LoIO when I was but a lad with a root spell. :)<br />
<br />
No other expansion has provided so much content, no many diverse levels, and so much fun. I agree that Luclin kind of sucked. The Grey was unbelievable for a few weeks, but they gimped it so bad it is empty now. :(<br />

I can only cast my vote from the way these zones are now. I really like the planes and Kunark. How did you guys ever manage without PoK? LOL</div></div><hr />

Kunark is my favorite though.  LDoN could have been great if there had been a larger loot table and the raid's had been worthwhile.<br />
<br />
I have no ill will towards Luclin.  VT is/was the coolest looking zone in game and i forgot all about the camps once i got in.  If anything I wish I could have found more groups and spent more time in AC when it was level relevant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kerech</div><div class="date">09-07-2004, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kunark for me.  It added such a vast amount of world area to the game, with stuff to do at almost every level.   Velious is a close second though as my favorite zones (Crystal Caverns and Tower of Frozen Shadows) were in that one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vixzen</div><div class="date">11-11-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love PoP!  I love the raiding, the content the graphics, the mobs, everything!  <br />
2nd would be Ykesha... I think that's the one where we got the shared bank and we got to color our armor.  No more dropping stuff and logging on my alt to pick it up in secluded places lol.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  omg sorry!  I didn't realize how old this poll was :(</div></div><hr />

Velious, hands down.   No contest in my mind.</div></div><hr />

But in hindsight, it was a remarkable expansion.  Tons of depth to such a small area and I think it had to have the most graphic elements of any expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfyre</div><div class="date">09-09-2005, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Playing since beta Velious is my fav.  Velious was the father/mother of dynamic content!  True interaction with NPC with NPC and quests that (at the time) riped your heart out and showed it to you.<br />
<br />
On the graphical side of things... snow zones own...</div></div><hr />
