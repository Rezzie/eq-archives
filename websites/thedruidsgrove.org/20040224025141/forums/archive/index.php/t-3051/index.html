<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
I am currently waiting to change servers atm.<br />
<br />
When I show up on my new sever I dont wanna have to be commando all the time.<br />
<br />
Was wondering what some options might be to re equip. Now most things I have a pretty good idea on what I need to get, and with a KEI or 2 I think I can get a set of Elysian stuff fairly fast.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the two slots I have NO idea on, is Primary and  Ear.<br />
<br />
Had epic so long, I dont know what I am gonna do without it, and ear, had both Xanthe's earrings so long, its been longer then epic.<br />
<br />
Things I am looking for in Primary, is HP+MANA+ WIS. Hopefully not a book or scroll either.<br />
<br />
Friend of mine already has me a sheild, so something 1hb or 1hs would be nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ear, I would like to get a earring of soltice &lt;sp&gt; again, then get a diffrent ear on the other side. Looking for basicly the same thing on that HP+Mana +Wis.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be welcome. <br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah should have been more spacific sorry.<br />
<br />
I am looking to buy them. Nothing too high priced. maybe 4k max on a item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lady Mistic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">tomb of the winds wisdom, its not a bad prime item and should not cost to much anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Which server you xfering to? just curious =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What's wrong with Xanthe's Earring of Nature in the other ear slot?  Seems like the easiest option to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Earring of living thunder from BoT is kinda nice has 80m on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am going from Bertoxx.<br />
<br />
To Torvonolious&lt;sp&gt;<br />
<br />
Got a couple RL friends over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regnon depending on how much cash you have, I'd probably pick up racial druid armor.  (Esp if my friends could make it)  And work from there.  No sense spending time in UP camping gear, when you could be in BoT hunting ornate armor (still dropping right)  and with some luck win some rolls on runes or ornate armor to upgrade with and sell the racial druid armor.<br />
<br />
Replace the two Xanthe earrings as they are good price/performance.<br />
<br />
Also look at the adventures in LDoN some nice drops there from normal mode adventures even.  (AC 57 plate class BP, AC 45 or so chain one that I've looted so far)<br />
<br />
Not to mention in LDoN with raid points (that should transfer) you will be able to pick up some gear that takes the good augments.  Being able to group with your RL friends, means they'll know your gimped gear wise and be able to help cover it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lady Mistic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yay trov, its a good one :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah I am looking forward to the transfer.<br />
<br />
Leaving behind really good friends on bertoxx.<br />
But I have already met many cool people on Torvon.<br />
Cant wait to get started.<br />
<br />
Good Idea on the cultural stuff. Sadly enough my smithing is only 115 or this would not be a problem. I didnt do smithing till the DAY before they patched the new Trivs in.<br />
<br />
I most likely will be um.....aquiring some plat to help with the transition. My friends are really cool, but i would feel like a dork asking them to take all their time and re equip me.<br />
<br />
+ with using my last few plat to upgrade tradeskills i can make Nighmare wood bows and such for profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trevize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You could save up a ton of adv pts in LDoN and buy gear when you arrive on the new server.<br />
<br />
Assuming...  adv pts transfer?    Hmmm.  that's probably a good question.  Do they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Only three parts of the epic can't be solo'd by a nekkid druid ... Frog, leezard and dragon.  Pretty much everything else is soloable.<br />
<br />
When I did my epic, I used the bind camp method.  Not the zek version of bind camping ;)  <br />
<br />
Bind in everfrost (or hunt ice giants for cash) and track for the tainted mammy.  Hell, massacre mammies and sell their tusks for 7pp each!  Bind in rathe mnts (or hunt hill giants for cash) and keep track up for the tainted hill giant.  For the non-cash generating camps, just bind there and gate over before logging off.  Hit track, if tainted isn't up, log out.  Log back on the next day and hit track.  If tainted still isn't up, gate elsewhere and hunt.<br />
<br />
Can do the same with elysian armour.<br />
<br />
After getting the mammy and hill giant, you should have enough farmed cash to get Xanthe and Solstice earrings.  You said you had some friends in Torv so you'll easily be able to get frog, VSR and dragon for your epic.  Hell, make them help with seahorse as well and maybe farm phinny for bard/rogue/mage/wizzy epics.<br />
<br />
Help a friend with their epic piece and you can pretty much guarantee help with yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Been 5 days, not transfered yet.<br />
Waiting SUCKS.</div></div><hr />

Tainted Cyclops and Brownie might be a little rough to solo naked, but not impossible I suppose.  Might depend some on levels and AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Regnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah,<br />
I do have several people who are going to help me out.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for the suggestions<br />
Pretty much just waiting on the server transfer now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh ... I realize that druids are a bit timid about soloing summoners.  But with Hand and Illumination low 50's summoners aren't all that tough.<br />
<br />
Just load up magic nukes and scoriae (fast cast) as well as chloroblast and nature's infusion.<br />
<br />
Although not solo nazi solo, getting symbol, WoG, brells, focus and KEI in PoK before heading off to OOT or LFay would certainly help.<br />
<br />
Porcupine old world summoners.  They don't hit especially hard with ATK debuffs.  Snare them, root them, DoT them (Fire DoTs then swarm), then nuke the bejeezus out of them.  Heal as required.<br />
<br />
The tainted mobs don't summon so root rot until they are in flee mode.  snare them then med up to full mana.  Kill and enage the corrupted.<br />
<br />
I pulled the corrupted to sister isle and ran into one of the huts.  Wedged myself into a corner and burned mana like it was going out of style.<br />
<br />
For the corrupted brownie, I pulled it to the GFay zone and found a nice corner at the zone tunnel to wedge myself into.</div></div><hr />
