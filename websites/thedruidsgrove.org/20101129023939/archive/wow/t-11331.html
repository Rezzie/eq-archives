<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Client Patch &quot;Before the Storm&quot;  (12/5/2006)<br />
<br />
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/<br />
<br />
Looking for Group Interface Tool<br />
<br />
A new Looking For Group tool designed to assist players in finding groups for instanced dungeons and quests will now be available. This interface gives players the option to be added to a pool of other players also looking for a group, as a means to expedite the process. In addition, players will also be able to search for additional members in situations where they have a group and are simply looking to find more players. For a complete overview of this new interface, please take a moment and read the information contained on our comprehensive Looking for Group preview.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * All players will have their talent points reimbursed and will have access to new talents throughout their trees; this includes the 41-point talents. Several new abilities have also been added for all classes.<br />
    * All pets will now receive a percentage of their master's armor, spell damage, spell resistances, attack power, and stamina.<br />
    * Low-level spells cast by high-level players will receive smaller bonuses from +healing and +spell damage.<br />
    * HoTs, DoTs, and channeled spells have been re-balanced to receive a more appropriate (higher) percentage of +spell damage and +healing.<br />
    * HoTs from different sources will now stack (i.e. multiple druids can cast the Rejuvenation spell on 1 target).<br />
    * New item property &quot;Resilience&quot; has been introduced. Resilience reduces your chance to be the victim of a critical strike, and reduces the amount of damage critical strikes do to you.<br />
    * Weapon Skill now does the following:<br />
          o Weapon skill will no longer reduce the percentage damage lost due to glancing.<br />
          o The player will gain 0.1% to their critical strike rating per weapon skill against monsters above their level. <br />
    * When casting a buff on a low level target, the appropriate rank of the buff will automatically be applied.<br />
    * In PvP, Crowd Control effects will last no longer than 12 seconds instead of the full duration, with a chance of a heartbeat resist.<br />
    * Players will no longer lose faction when under the influence of &quot;Mind Control&quot; or the Gnomish Mind Control Cap.<br />
    * Several improvements have been made to the Macintosh client, including support for Multi-Threaded OpenGL on Intel Macs running OS X 10.4.8 or higher. <br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
    * Honor System Revamp<br />
          o Current honor totals have been reset.<br />
          o Players may display their highest lifetime rank title (accessible from character sheet).<br />
          o Honor points earned each day may now be spent as a form of currency.<br />
          o Check the PvP tab of your character sheet to see your honor information.<br />
          o PvP rewards are no longer unique. <br />
    * Marks of Honor earned from battlegrounds are no longer turned in for reputation or honor. They are now used in addition to honor points in order to purchase rewards.<br />
    * Two New Arenas are now available in three different modes.<br />
          o 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 matches<br />
          o Players may queue up at Goblin NPC's in Stormwind, Ironforge,<br />
          o Orgrimmar, Undercity, and Gadgetzan <br />
<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
    * The talent &quot;Swiftmend&quot; will now include bonus healing from the talents &quot;Improved Rejuvenation&quot; and &quot;Empowered Rejuvenation&quot;.<br />
    * &quot;Omen of Clarity's&quot; duration has been increased to 30 min.<br />
<br />
Hunters<br />
<br />
    * Traps can be set while in combat, but require a 2 second arming time.<br />
    * &quot;Auto shot&quot; will be automatically enabled if the Hunter steps out of melee range while in combat with target.<br />
    * 1 Agility will now grant 1 Ranged Attack Power.<br />
    * &quot;Auto shot&quot; is now reset when casting Aimed Shot.<br />
    * &quot;The Beast Within's&quot; Bonus damage caused has been reduced to 10%, but now also reduces the mana cost of all spells by 20%.<br />
    * Freezing Traps will now cancel combat when cast. <br />
<br />
Mages<br />
<br />
    * &quot;Frost Nova&quot; (Water Elemental Spell) has now been renamed &quot;Freeze&quot;. <br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
    * Shaman with the appropriate talent spec are now able to dual-wield.<br />
          o Self-weapon buffs such as Windfury Weapon can be applied to both main and off-hand weapons. <br />
    * Rockbiter's weapon functionality has been changed. It is now a damage proc instead of a flat attack power bonus.<br />
    * Windfury Weapon and Rockbiter Weapon enchantments will only benefit the weapon with the enchantment on it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Warlocks<br />
<br />
    * The range of &quot;Drain Life&quot; and &quot;Drain Mana&quot; spells have been increased. <br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors<br />
<br />
    * Rage generation from dealing damage has been normalized.<br />
          o All Rage awards are averaged with our expected rage per swing (adjusted for weapon speed). <br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
    * The &quot;Far Sight&quot; effect has changed so that the camera now zooms in to a distant location, rather than instantly showing the distant view. This also affects the items: Ultra-Spectropic Vision Goggles, the Ornate Spyglass, and the Hunter ability &quot;Eagle Eye.&quot;<br />
    * Spells can now require either a totem item or a totem category item to cast a spell. This means that the Enchanting Rods now count as all of the lower level enchanting rods as well, so you only need a single enchanting rod instead of all six. This also means that &quot;Finkle's Skinner&quot; now counts as a Skinning Knife. Several weapons that are picks have been flagged as counting as a Mining pick as well.<br />
    * Items that give bonuses, such as critical strike percentage, have been modified to adhere to a combat rating system.<br />
    * All current items will provide the exact same benefit from ratings at level 60 as they provided before the ratings system.<br />
    * Thrown weapon items no longer stack, but use durability instead. One unit of durability is lost per throw, and these items can be repaired.<br />
    * The tool tip for the Great Staff of the Guardian now shows the proper increase of 28 to the party spell critical rating.<br />
    * Items that are useable from player inventory with a cooldown will now update the cooldown in real-time.<br />
    * Players will no longer be able to sell the &quot;Blue Skeletal Horse&quot; to vendors.<br />
    * The damage Proc from the item &quot;Misplaced Servo Arm&quot; will no longer break the Rogue ability &quot;Gouge&quot;.<br />
    * The &quot;Skull of Impending Doom&quot; has been changed and will now increase run speed by 60% for 10 seconds, but deals damage equal to 60% of your maximum health and drains 60% of your maximum mana for over 10 seconds.<br />
    * The Backfire effect on the &quot;Net-O-Matic&quot; will no longer break on damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
    * All of the profession-made items that have been created up to now have been given proper stats based on the current expansion item level progression table.<br />
    * Most of the items made by Tailoring/Leatherworking/Blacksmithing have had their creation time reduced. Now the cap on time required to make an item in those professions is based on quality and level.<br />
          o New Max times required.<br />
                + Level 31+ Green Items at least 8 sec<br />
                + Level 31+ Blue Items at least 15 sec<br />
                + Level 31+ Purple Items at least 25 sec <br />
    * Skill level now determines what items you can disenchant.<br />
          o Skill 1= Level 1-20<br />
          o Skill 25= Level 20-25<br />
          o Skill 50= Level 25-30<br />
          o Skill 75= Level 30-35<br />

          o Skill 175= Level 50-55<br />
          o Skill 200= Level 55-60<br />
          o Skill 225= Level 60-65 <br />
    * Players will no longer lose an item when attempting to disenchant on a boat when the loading screen appears. <br />
<br />
<br />

    * LFG/LFM UI<br />
          o Tips have been added to Loading Screen tips and new player tips<br />
          o Meeting Stones now function similar to a Warlock Summon spell.<br />

<br />
Also Actually--unless you noted elsewhere that they were there, or excluded them for some reason (thought, we knew of a good few of them)--Druids had several other listed changes. Pardon moi, but I'll post them for the heck of it:<br />

<br />
I particularly like the changes in the bottom two. Did anyone know of them? is on my patch notes too, looking at it now.<br />
<br />
