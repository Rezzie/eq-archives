<br />
I am having problems understanding it though. I read the guides on other sites but they talk only about the mats and where to get them and at what prices. I have most of the basic mats already so no problem there.<br />
<br />
I have a few very basic questions which I never found an answer to.<br />
<br />
1. How far can you d/E for leveling points?<br />
<br />
2. For the pieces to enchant, what is the best method to get them? Do I just find the dirt cheapest green pieces (@10-15s) in the ah and de them? Do I run low level instances (stocks, sm graveyard) grab as much green loot as i can? Then do I de them until that gives no more points and then just start to enchant those pieces and sell?<br />
<br />
3. I am looking to level up enchanting with as little involvement with others as possible (i.e. free enchant spams).  I would rather farm/grind for the armor/weapons and enchant them vs. trying to get gear from others. <br />
<br />
Thanks!!!</div></div><hr />

Only if you want to get them that quick and have the pockets for it<br />

<br />
This was my preferred method good fun soloing low level instances and just DEing everything<br />
<br />

<br />
You can enchant the same item over and over again so no need to enchant and sell just keep enchanting the same item until you run out of mats or need to train a higher level. <br />

As Swear said, you can Enchant the same piece over and over.  Beyond that the piece doesn't have to be green.  I'd just buy a vendor/white lowbie bracer/chest/shield etc.<br />
<br />
I did a mix of buying/farming.  Part of the Auctioneer package is Enchantrix (I think, if not it's it own addon) that lets you know the % chance of what an item will DE too.  Some items sell on the AH for more then it'll DE into... so sell it and buy mats.  If you don't want to get an addon, a good rule of thumb is alway sell cloth &quot;of the Eagle&quot; or leather &quot;of the Monkey&quot;.</div></div><hr />
