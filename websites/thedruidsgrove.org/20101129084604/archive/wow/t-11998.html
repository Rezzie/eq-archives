I was the only healer.  Almost all of the drops were for healing, and all of it was an improvement for me.  I gotta tell ya.....I scored some darned good healing gear and I look GOOD in it!<br />

I was in a Blood Furnace run with my hunter where it seemed that all the really good stuff that dropped when to the Resto druid who was healing.  Not a problem as the gear was clearly healer oriented and she deserved it, but it was kinda like &quot;Blizz, what about the rest of us?&quot;.  I think she improved her gear by well over a hundred +heal in that run alone.<br />
<br />
I'm like you, feral while leveling, and I enjoy tanking and DPS, but I actually want to heal more than I get to.  Most random PuG whispers ask me to tank.  I too plan on going resto at higher level, not sure when.</div></div><hr />

Leveling up (from 60-70) I went feral and thought I was going to respec resto to raid the moment I hit 70...turns out I never did (permanently) because it seems like tanks are getting harder and harder to find.</div></div><hr />

We need healers - which is fortunate for me, because I rock at healing and tank at tanking! :p</div></div><hr />
