<br />
Got my Druid to 60 5 days ago and have 4 pieces of the blue pvp set now.  I am loving the +15% speed bonus... WSG is a blast now.  I have a 60 lock and hunter and my druid is so much more fun than I would have thought.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll be heading towards two pieces of purple (Chest, Legs) for honour next, but my question is towards weapons.<br />
<br />
I currently have the Blanchard's Stout which is +20 str, +15 sta, +5 fr.  Should I be looking at the easily attainable Unstoppable Force, or something else?<br />
<br />
I'm feral spec'd down to Mangle with 9 in Resto.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<br />
I myself have all the agi&gt;str&gt;sta gear i can get, if it has +to crit I favor it. Nonetheless I also have Sta&gt;Str gear that i wear to get 6k hp and 20 to crit in bear. Bear in mind all my gear is blue. I also use wardrobe so I change into different gear depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
I digress. If you have alot of agi and crit gear I would say go for the unstoppable force since it has the stats of your current weapon and more. Also it has more crit which is awesome in PvP.<br />
All my crit gear lets me get my dmg out while i do my patheric stun lock on casters. Now if you want an alternative, there is a mace in Blackrock Spire that has almost the same stats as the warden staff. That mace is perfect for bear because it has 1k armor for your bear form.<br />
<br />
One last thing, since i think you cant get your hands on raid lewt yet, i suggest you stick with the unstoppable force. My friend who was a Field Marshall still uses that weapon because he has no alternative for the kind of gear he wears.<br />
<br />
Anyways. It was a long response but it was to explain WHY i suggest the weapons im saying.<br />

Currently I'm about 921 AP in cat (my preference to playing especially in BGs).  I have about 21.54% to crit so far so another 2% effectively would be great I think and the UF is only 7k honour also.<br />

It's a fun instance anyway and with so many people in rank 13 and HWL gear it's getting real easy. Slap a 15str or 25agi enchant on it and go to town.<br />
