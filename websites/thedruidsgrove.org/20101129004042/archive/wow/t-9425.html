<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starfire</div><div class="date">10-07-2005, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are a bidding on an open, boxed copy of the World of Warcraft game. Complete with owner's manual and all original contents. In accordance with World of Warcraft EULA section 3.B this includes access to the account which accompanies this boxed copy and any characters that may reside on said account.<br />
<br />
Due to a busier fall semester than I had planned, I no longer have the time to continue playing my Level 60 Night Elf Druid on the Kilrogg (PvE) server and I hope to find him a good home.<br />
<br />
Worn gear for this character consists of a completely epic armor set with 5 pieces of the tier 1 Cenarion set and 3 pieces of the tier 2 Stormrage set. This character also comes complete with a pair of epic weapons and a highly sought after epic ring, as well as numerous pieces of equipment that can be swapped out as the situation calls for. This character has been a member of one of the most prestigious raiding guilds on the server, and with the current equipment and good reputation would have no problem being recruited into any high end guild he chooses. The character is keyed/attuned to every single instance in the game, including Molten Core, Onyxia, and Blackwing Lair. <br />
<br />
This character is also the only Night Elf on the server to have Exhalted reputation with Ironforge and thus have an Epic Ram Mount, as well as the lvl 40 Ram Mount and Lvl 40 Tiger Mount. The character has 85g gold on him at the moment with a wide assortment of goods on hand in the bank which can be sold or auctioned as you see fit.<br />
<br />
The character is also the highest ranked alchemist and herbalist with 300 skill in both. He has a number of high end recipes already on him and is able to make any others you may find or purchase.<br />
<br />
There are several alts on the account as well, including a Level 40 Dwarf Priest with good gear for his level and an a few gold for his spells.<br />

Ebay sometimes nukes em before they sell and sometimes they don't.  Alot of the time Blizzard takes notice as well and the account itself is closed out even if money has already been paid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ndainye</div><div class="date">10-07-2005, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see anything wrong with that character, equipment seems in line with BWL raiding guild drops, could very well be the only NE that has a Ram mount on server as most NE's wouldn't want rams :) but that could be bs most people that sell characters attempt to inflat their value in some manner.<br />
<br />
And no this is very much not the first ebayed character more like the 1000th</div></div><hr />
