I would like to start doing DoN missions to earn crytals for armor but I've discovered that I need to do some factioning before I can do missions. The npc's at the Wayfarer Mercenary's camp in Lavastorm won't talk to me yet, what lvl do I need to be before I can starting the factioning missions?</div></div><hr />

Just make sure you speak to the right NPCs for the faction that you are interested.<br />
<br />
And at the end of a group mission, make sure you hand in the faction gem you get to help boost your faction more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be nice to know for sure though since I'm leveling up a baby necro and would like to start on the DoN goodies, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rashere - The missions start at around level 55 and similar to LDoN, they scale based on the level of your group.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Brekkee - *sildonte* What will be the level range that DoN is targeted for as far as new fighting zones?<br />
Rytan - The level range for DoN starts at level 45 and goes on up through 70 at a variety of difficulties. There's a pretty sizable difference between player powers with AAs and equipment, and we've added content that should cover all of that range. <br />

Could probably get them at 46 but tried last at 45, sorry about saying 46 in the first post. :(<br />
<br />
I took the Gathering Silks task, supposed to gather 8 Lavaspinner Silks from Lavaspinner's Lair, not sure if I can do this one solo yet but I'm gonna try it.</div></div><hr />
