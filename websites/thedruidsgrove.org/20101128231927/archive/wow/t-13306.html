<br />
As the name of the post says i would like to know,<br />
what type of equips for what situation u carry arround or have on the bank.<br />
<br />
Here are mine:<br />
- Feral Tank<br />
- Feral Tank max. Mitigation (just 2 items different from normal tank gear)<br />
- Feral Tank max. HP (the frost-resi-items swapped in + stam-trinkets)<br />
- Feral Tank max. HP + fire-resistance (on bank; with pala-aura at 416 fire-resistance @ 48k HP -&gt; about 0 aggro-generation )<br />
- Feral Tank  hit-capped, 14% expertise for max. aggro<br />
- Kitty-DPS (for mostly Raid)<br />
- PvP-Set (all items except 1 trinket and Journeys End are the PvP-Items; usually dressed while doing dailies -&gt; horde is crying if they gank me :wink: )<br />
<br />
And for my non-main-speccs:<br />
- Heal-Set (complete naxx10, naxx25, no blues or stuff)<br />
- Moonkin-Set (no shared items with heal-set, almost all items are 25man-content-items, 4piece T7.5)<br />
<br />
<br />
So what to say more....<br />
BLIZZARD I NEED BIGGER BAGS!!!!!!!! :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-07-2009, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have (keep with me)<br />
<br />
1) Bear - Trash = High TPS / Avoidance<br />
2) Bear - Boss = Mix of Stam / Avoidance<br />
3) Bear - Stam = Uber Stam (Sarth etc)<br />
4) Kitty - Raid = Hit Capped (also serves as my Heroic Bear Gear, otherwise go rage starved)<br />
5) Boomkin - Hit Cap<br />
6) Resto - Spirit Stacked<br />
7) Herbing - Haste Stacked, pick a flower in ~4 secs <br />
<br />
8) I have several PvP sets too, but they stay in the bank.<br />
<br />
...I have all +20 slot bags and only room in my backpack for non-gear.<br />
<br />
Many of these sets share items with each other, but there is no way I could manage them without Outfitter. May seem excessive, but to quote a disney movie &quot;Luck favors the prepared&quot;! Have the right gear for the right encounter = Win.<br />
<br />
Also, even as feral I like to keep my +SP set close for &quot;Near Wipes&quot;. 10-15 bodies on the floor and folks need Rez's, its a lot speedier if the bear slaps on +SP gear and Innervates self then starts helping rez. No Incombat advantage, just a time saver and curtiousy to those who keep me alive!</div></div><hr />

<br />
or to quote a non-disney movie 'chance favours the prepared mind'</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) PvP set (this is my Outfitter default set)<br />
2) Kitty dps set (mostly Naxx25 drops, heroic staff still, and a couple blues)<br />
3) Gimped bear set (mostly stuff from my kitty set and PvP set, with Enraged Feral Staff and the Naxx25 armor trinket)<br />
4) Gimped healer set (i *do* have the 1Hander from heroic Nexxus though)<br />
<br />
i seriously need to clean out my bank, too... I'm running out of runn everywhere, and yes, i have Haris Pilton's bag, and the 22-slot bag that drops from OS :(</div></div><hr />
