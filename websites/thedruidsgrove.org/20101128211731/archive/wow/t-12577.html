For tanking I'd recommend you have about 14k HP fully raid buffed at least.  you want the Heavy Clefthoof set and definitely be pushing 18-20k armour (I think that's where I started).  BE UNCRITABLE at a minumum.  <br />
<br />
For DPS, I always tell people if you are going to DPS in Kara, you damn well better be able to do 400 DPS MINIMUM.  HP wise you want probably 7k-8k fully raid buffed as a druid.  That might be a stretch, but you'll be amazed at how much easier your life becomes if you aim for more HP.  I went into Kara with my hunter having 6500 HP fully raid buffed and I got killed 6 times on the way to Attumen.... I never lived that day down.... (Of course as the raid leader I should have known better so I deserved the ribbing I got.)</div></div><hr />

When I started running Kara I was at<br />
<br />
- 415 defense and 3/3 SotF<br />
- 12k HP unbuffed<br />
- 25k armour unbuffed<br />
<br />
These stats are more than enough to start Kara IMO (my dedicated priest healer said that she was falling asleep healing me).</div></div><hr />
