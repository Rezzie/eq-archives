Night Elf or Tauren?<br />
<br />
Race Description <br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/wow/images/nightelf/townhall-nightelf3.gifThe reclusive Night Elves were the first race to awaken in the World of Warcraft. These shadowy, immortal beings were the first to study magic and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before Warcraft I. The Night Elves' reckless use of magic drew the Burning Legion into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their wondrous homeland was shattered and drowned by the sea. Until recently, the Night Elves closed themselves off from the rest of the world and remained hidden atop their holy mountain of Hyjal for many thousands of years. The Legion's invasion brought the Night Elves out of their long period of slumber. They now have renewed interest in shaping the world, and for the first time are allying themselves with other races to insure the continued survival of Azeroth. As a race, Night Elves are typically honorable and just, but they are very distrusting of the 'lesser races' of the world. They are nocturnal by nature and their shadowy powers often elicit the same distrust that they have for their mortal neighbors.<br />

http://www.blizzard.com/wow/images/tauren/townhall-tauren3.gifThe Tauren are huge, bestial creatures who live in the grassy, open barrens of central Kalimdor. They live to serve nature and maintain the balance between the wild things of the land and the restless spirit of the elements. Despite their enormous size and brute strength, the remarkably peaceful Tauren cultivate a quiet, tribal society. However, when roused by conflict, Tauren are implacable enemies who will use every ounce of their strength to smash their enemies under hoof. Under the leadership of their ancient chief, Cairne Bloodhoof, the Tauren allied themselves with the Orcs during the invasion of the Burning Legion. The two races have remained steadfast allies ever since. Like the Orcs, the Tauren struggle to retain their sense of tradition and noble identity.<br />

But if that wasn't an issue, I'd be leaning towards Night Elf simply because they can have a mount.  Its all well and good that Tauren's don't NEED a mount, but somehow that just doesn't seem as interesting to me, which is a shame since I think the &quot;culture&quot; of their race is far more interesting.  :)</div></div><hr />

Also, you can only play one faction per server, no having horde and alliance characters on the same one, different servers is fine though.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... that's odd.  I wonder why they limit you like that to one faction.</div></div><hr />

Though I would rather a night elf, (so my name could be 'Stormrage' instead of 'Blood hoof' [unless those names are taken]) it all depends on what my friends want to be.  Right now, my main friend that's definatly going to play is either going to be undead warrior or human warrior.  Though he's more focussing on human, which is good.</div></div><hr />

I would have probably gone Tauren anyway. I like their look. Once you have Warstomp you will look for its icon on other toons you play.<br />
<br />
You can only play one faction on PvP servers due to the spying/bias issue, but you can play both factions on PvE/RP servers.<br />

I would rather be a NE becuase the Shapeshift Forms look cooler to me. I also like starting and playing in the forest for most of the low lvls. In horde u finish lvling to 10 in a grassland. then go start to desert. The Barrens is Huge and can get you from lvl 10-25+ But i'd rather stay in a forest area. seems alot less crowded. And Horde, Barrens Chat has way to much talking on my server. i keep it off until i need a grp but once i type something it flys past to the next page almost instantly. i have to ask for a grp for quest like 12 before someone realizes im talking. The NE also have the Shadowmeld Ability that makes them go un seen. So in the lvl 10-19 WSG u can go Shadowmeld and when someone is about to pass u, u can use Root and make them stay and put a couple moonfires and take them out fast. but on the other hand Tuerans ,which i cant spell their name, Has a raical move that stuns targets which is AWESOME for shamans. plus the main reason i would rather be a NE druid than a Tueran is that their Shapeshift forms look cooler... That is all....</div></div><hr />

I've always found that the Horde players are a tiny bit more mature, even if it is only a tiny bit lol.<br />
My second reason would be that Night Elfs all look like women. Even the men all have long hair. And when you try to butch them up by putting a beard on them, they look like the Police Officer from the Village People. Bleugh. I much prefer how Taurens look. Although, I do love the Night Elf starting area ^^</div></div><hr />
