<br />
Enchanting should allow you to dust/shard anything you pick up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">02-20-2008, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tailoring allows you to convert cloth drops into dust and shards. IMO that's no reason to choose tailoring. You're not escaping the cost of those enchanting mats if you can generate them yourself. In fact, all you're doing is assuming the additional cost of leveling tailoring.<br />
<br />
For the purposes of this discussion there are two kinds of enchanting mats: &quot;low&quot; level mats you shard from drops from instance bosses you can solo, and &quot;high&quot; level mats that require... effort. Either you need to get a group together to run the high level instances and win the drops and shard them, or buy them on the AH and shard them, or invest thousands of gold to level tailoring and then hundreds of gold to craft the items which you will then shard.<br />
<br />
There's no way of getting around the cost of high-end enchanting mats. Choose tailoring for the BOP crafted items and relative convenience of being able to make your own caster gear.</div></div><hr />

Once you reach the outlands, greens drop like candy and you'll have plenty of stuff to DE.  And you can always go back and make a few solo runs of lower level instances to help level DE to BC levels if needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get your first 50 points you can just shard everything you get from soloing deadmines a few times. (Which you can do at level 40, or earlier depending on class.) That should provide enough mats to take you to, oh I don't know, 100 enchanting skill? Then wait a few more levels and move on to an instance that provides the next level of dust and essences. Rinse, repeat. (Other than free enchanting mats for your use or selling on the AH, you can AH the really rare BOE drops from these instances for sometimes hundreds of gold from twinks.)<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that eventually you're going to find that you can't solo instances, even at level 70. Strath might be the hard cap on what you can do by yourself, even at 70. Still, that gives you access to all the mats you need to get to 300, and [Large Brilliant Shard] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=14344)s still sell for a decent amount of money - which you can then spend on Outland instance enchanting mats.</div></div><hr />
