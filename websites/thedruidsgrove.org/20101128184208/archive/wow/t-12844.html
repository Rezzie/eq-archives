<br />
The Crimson Permanent Assurance (http://eu.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Hellscream&amp;n=Crimson+Perm+Assurance&amp;p=1) is based on EU Hellscream.<br />
<br />
We're a small, casual, mature guild looking to gear up and resume raiding in preparation for Wrath.<br />
<br />
We have a core of well equipped, well played characters for the level (T4 basically) and are looking to increase our membership with a view to resuming attempts on ZA as soon as possible and, hopefully, poke our heads round some 25 man content before no-body wants to go back there anymore.<br />
<br />
We raid twice a week (wednesdays and fridays currently with the odd sunday/monday to complete anything outstanding), have people who enjoy smacking the horde round a bit and can otherwise be found doing all the usual stuff you do when you aren't raiding.<br />
<br />
While we don't insist on raid attendence, we are primarily looking for people who want to do just that.<br />
<br />
We're looking for all talents and all classes right now but Feral druids of either persuasion or h00tkins are especially welcome at the current time.<br />
<br />
