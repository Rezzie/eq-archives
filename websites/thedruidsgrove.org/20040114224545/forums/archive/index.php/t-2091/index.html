<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wuldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, im 53 right now, been there for a month, and really am having trouble finding a camp that suits me.  Raptors are great exp, but they take soo much work to pull (correctly, an idiot can pull them all within 2 seconds :)  ), Wyvvies are overcamped, and sometimes are lite blu, and othmir...i kinda wanna keep my faction good with them (prexus totem) i was suggested by a friend to go to Lfay and kill Brownie guards, but their re-spawn time is SOOOOOO LONG....so i ask you guys, where can i easily quad kite, or root/dot mobs for good exp.  Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't follow you.<br />
<br />
Raptors are great at 53.  Why are they hard to pull?<br />
<br />
Send me a PM if you want to know how to keel them.<br />
<br />
I found them fast, furious, and fun.  <br />
<br />
Aside from the training ksing disspelling Bards out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wuldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">like, their aggro range is so dam large<br />
i snare one, i get 8, i end up running toward chessboard, snaring as i go....but its always too much to handle...i dotn know, thats just me<br />
<br />
amazingly, CS was EMPTY last nite and i got about a whole yellow done in about an hour....but, i was able to make all Dark Blue pulls, and no Lite blues, and i didnt have to worry about KS-ers or anything, so it went a lot faster than planned, i coulda had more if i hadnt have been silly and done my first 3 kills on AA exp...ohwell....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My advice is to try a) new zones and b) new techniques.<br />
<br />
I'd highly recommend charming in Jaggedpine at your level.  Charm a pet, attack a mob, break charm when both are low health and kill both for xp.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  <br />
<br />
Also, at 53 you have some good options for Root/Dotting like JP Gnolls, Toilers in ME or even PoP Tier 1 yard trash.  I'd think you could knock out about 10-20% per hour in those spots without much trouble.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise, check out the guide Aidon put together that's on the website (if it's up at the moment).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wuldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, Primero, read your post, sounds great, but...<br />
<br />
Where do you think it is best to Pull the Toilers in ME from?<br />
<br />
And What Tier 1 Planes do you suggest? (im thinking PoN, PoD, PoJ maybe...)<br />
<br />
and thanks for posting, hopefully you will get back ta me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>willain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Charming rats in PoD, and attacking flies is nice.<br />
Charming ravens in PoN is great.<br />
Quadding boats in Dulak, gnolls in JP, wyverns, raptors, are also ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>netura emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">there is a spot in ME where you can quad with *no* adds, besides what you pull.<br />
<br />
so heres what ya do. www.eqatlas.com/luclin/ma...yemap.html (http://www.eqatlas.com/luclin/maidenseyemap.html)<br />
on this map, look at numbers 2 and number 4. one is a house on the water, the other is an obelisk type structure.<br />
<br />
the land between these structures is flat, until it starts sloping down to the water, and up to the obelisk. I never went down or up (if ya get what i mean.) Just grab toilers from the hill and around the water, if you do it right, you can grab em and get no aggro at all.<br />
<br />
IMO, the hardest part of doing it, is getting there without any seeinvis guys attacking ya.<br />
<br />
GL to you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still have no idea why a Druid would think that raptors are hard to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bippwinno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With harmony no outside mob  is hard to singlepull.<br />
<br />
How do you do to get 8 raptors?<br />
If you snare 1 you should at most get 1 add, I have never got more then that when hunting raptors. <br />
Why do you run to chessboard? you have plenty of room on the island, big and small, to circle aroun and snare them all.<br />
<br />
Easiest is to go to small island, when the 1 roamer gets to the side closes to big island snare the static, run to other end of beach, turn around snare the roamer.<br />
snare the static on the other side of the beach. lasso them to a little group and go and get the one standing next to the mountain, the one which can be dino.<br />
Piece of cake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grinkle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think you're still too young for PoN - once you can charm some ravens, you'll get about one yellow for a bar of mana, with kei.  Its insane.  I started there at 56, if I recall, and I was 60 after perhaps 20'ish hours played in PoN.  I haven't played in months, though - it may be different (aka nerfed) now.<br />
<br />
You should be able to both charm kite and quad kite the raptors.  If you can't, you won't be a very effective high-end soloer as many zones where you get good exp soloing with either of these methods are harder than the raptors.  Learn to do both, is my advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gamilenka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they aren't wandering mobs, just use harmony of nature.<br />
<br />
I have a hard time keeping stalkers and ravens charmed in PoN.  If there is nobody between the stalkers and the zone, then I'll do it for a bit.  Last time I tried there were several people in the area, and after zoning 2 times I just gave it up for right then.  I didn't want to train anyone.  They are good xp though.  I was getting a blue every 2-3 kills.  I used the magic debuff, but they still broke charm fairly easy.  Every few casts I would get one that lasted for 2 or more fights.<br />
<br />
Wyverns are very boring and easy.  If there is nothing else you can think of open at the moment, and they are open to some extent, then they are better than nothing I guess.  I haven't killed othmir, I just like the fuzzy bastages.  If you think you can get decent xp from giants on velious (EW I think it is), you can charm a walrus (pretty sure, never tried though) and suicide it in to a pulled giant.  Just to make it easier on you is all.  The walrus will die.  Most of the giants probably won't be all that hard for you.  They are in the zone that the ulthorks are in, same zone as the one end of the big dragon bone bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd recommend charming rockhoppers in dawnshroud before you try charming anywhere else.  They should all be dark blue at 53.  They only hit for 100 or so, are static spawns, and they can be pulled out to a relatively add-free area.<br />
<br />
Charming in maiden's eye is a good step up from there, and should give you decent exp through 60+.  Pulling and crowd control can be a bit more difficult there, but mobs still only hit in the 150's most of the time (though <br />
<br />
Only once you're confident with your abilities in maiden's eye would I recommend trying to charm in plane of nightmares or plane of disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gamilenka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Probably a good idea actually.  Make sure you got your cha up and try it out.<br />
<br />
Probably a good idea, because it will help you get used to running around with a snare pet :mad:   Some people don't snare, but it's a lot harder to get it charmed the 2nd time around if it's not snared.  DSP might not be bad, I know wolves and zelniaks don't even run at normal speed.  I've pulled there with my monk, and my mage, with no sow; and, been able to avoid getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamarra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">at Lvl 53 I went to Gunthak and camped the castle steps quad kiting the maurauders there. Snare and Lightening Blast worked great. Always keep SOW going and a regen. I took the first four, killed them, medded to full mana took the next two, killed them and shortly after I got medded up again the first four had repopped. This works great for EXP and the drops provide some much needed cash. I usually pulled 500 -1000 pp worth of gems from there before my KEI expired. <br />
ONce I was done there and things were light blue and green to me &lt;56&gt; I went to Burning Woods and hunted Forest Giants at thier fortress and Wurms. I am still hunting there right now. Only single pull these creatures. Forest Giants can be easily done with a root/snare/Winged Death combo and any fire dot of your choosing. Wurms can be easily done with Snare/Root/Winged Death. Good Spell drops, I can usually clear 300 - 500 plat a day here too. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Also, at 53 you have some good options for Root/Dotting like JP Gnolls, Toilers in ME or even PoP Tier 1 yard trash.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know about other zones, but even at 60 I had trouble root/dotting in PoN.  The mobs were MR enough that root would be resisted or be broken early WAY too often.<br />
<br />
Now at 61, with Earthen Roots, it's a whole different story.<br />
<br />
One spot I can recommend, that's pretty good at 53, is the Sun Revenants in the Grey.  They are not too tough, and are level 55, so you would get a nice level-based XP bonus, even taking into account the Grey's nerfed ZEM.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Koldriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I am probably the most 'paraniod' druid you ever met. I STILL won't go to PoN! (well I have, but somehow I just can't master it yet)<br />
<br />
When I got done with poachers in JP at around 52 I also moved to Gunthak. I was bound just off to the right of the Nadox castle steps. I play 'oddish' hours so for me it was rare to ever find anyone else there. I went from 52 ish to 56ish just root-dotting those poachers (and got all my 6aa's there also) I think it took me maybe 2 weeks (about 2hrs/night).<br />
<br />
At 55/56 I started soloing in PoJ. The reason that I waited so long is because I don't aggro ANYTHING on the first floor and very little on the 2nd. Being able to single pull dark blues without aggroing the whole floor or a million rats is great! I have noticed that the xp is alot more 'lacking' than being in a group in one of the higher planes, but at least its something, and personally I find it ralaxing after a long day at work to be able to go into a zone and get a few % without dying or going OOM.<br />
<br />
People tell me I have leveled fast (58 in 8 months) but you will rarely ever see me in a zone that I consider 'dangerous' (I won't even try PoN until 60/61) and usually I am one of the highest in PoJ - besides those doing trials.  I rarely ever die. I have a ton of time to chat and enjoy the game. I don't think I have leveled quickly at all but I do ok and I have fun. It all depends on how you like to play...but if you are a little paranoid like me give Nadox a shot :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BricSummerthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At 53, if you don't yet have your Elysian, start or join an Elysian group. You will be killing red mobs, that drop excellent armor for you.<br />
<br />
I would not try to solo one at 53 unless you are fairly well geared, or have the root necklace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Logilitie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">pull all 12 raptors.. and just kill them all.. <br />
3 rounds of quad kiting.. you should have plenty of mana items and kei and pot9 or potc .. <br />
and then med til they all repop and repeat.<br />
real nice.. you can get them popping at a nice rate.. <br />
small break between rounds and almost continual XP.. <br />
i did this i think from 56 - 58, 59   memory kinda hazy.. <br />
<br />

<br />
I'm right there with ya! That zone still scares me:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Lyanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've wandered the same thing.  I'm currently 53, I prefer to solo, where should I go?<br />
<br />
Raptors I found too numbing but finished 52 there quading.  For variety (and since I had a rebreather) I tried kedge after I got my epic just to check it out.  Charm soloing here wasn't too hard once I learned my way around (including where Estrella was and where not to wander).  Xp was not too bad (biggest xp modifier in the game in this zone?), would be faster if I had more faith in charm soloing with my druid.  Sharks are animals, so are seahorses so lots of things to charm.<br />
<br />
I used to quad bezerkers/mammoths in EW along the southern shore from 49- 51 as my druid, after that a bunch of them would be light blue most of the time.  Did that same area with my chanter with a charmed/hasted manticore to 49, you have all that room to run and recharm!  Now I solo my chanter in kedge once I got her an eb item.  Some of the best solo xp for a chanter that I've seen in a while at 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>TristamDk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Once you master charming outside, I would recommend trying to charm using the chokdai in chardok.  This was probably one of the most fun things I have ever done in the game, I got insane exp, and charming in confined spaces is probably one of the more fun and useful soloing techniques I use.  Start off by getting a kei and using call of karana to take the ZI/ZO with the sniffers and eventually move to pulling the fort.  Once you've trivialized this, go past the fort, fall down the pit, hang a left and stay left to a little hallway with bigger chokdais and some random slaves scattered about.  This is where the fun starts because you get an insanely better pet than the sniffers and you can just rip through the sarnaks with a bit of room to run.  The one tip I would give you is if you haven't cleared the whole hall or broken the spawn, keep the mob you're fighting and any adds rooted and snared and root your pet if you dont have room to get another charm off.  Also, never hesitating to gate should save you plenty of deaths.  It really gets the heart pumping, Id recommend it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Len the druid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">agree with the above post Chardok was great in the 50's.  There's also Sentient armor in WL that's pretty good xp/cash in the mid 50's.  If you got dragon faction WW is good. Especially if you can find a ranger to bring along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aundra Windhover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">What would you guys recommend for a level 51 Druid who can't go to the planes....<br />

Solo or group doesn't matter....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I did wyverns in CS at 51.  They should still all be dark blue, and at 2500-2700 HP each, they're very quick to go through.  Well, quadding that is.  Root/Rot becomes a better deal at 52 once you get Breath of Ro (assuming you are Evoc spec).<br />
<br />
Tat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aundra Windhover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Are Wyverns a random spawn or roam in a certain place?<br />
<br />
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://eqatlas.com/velious/cobaltscarmap.html&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Cobalt Scar&lt;/a&gt; map is what I'm useing as reference...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They are non-random, non-roaming static spawns, ranging from roughly 2 to 5 to 7 to 4 on the map you linked.   It's been a while, but I'm thinking there's about 21-23 spawns, some grouped tightly (need harmony to single pull), some all by themselves.  There is a named you need to avoid if you're soloing (Yvolcarn ?) that can spawn in any of the various spawn spots.  They are on CoV faction, but you take no faction hit for killing them, so once you're non-KoS, you're set =)<br />
<br />
Also, if you're good at max-range root-rotting, the cobalt drakes are good targets.  There are only 4 spawns, and again, no faction hit for killing, and avoid the named (Azureake ?).<br />
