FYI, I hate Arena or Battle grounds, Id rather not have to go that route for the gear. Thanks.<br />

Hey, I'm also on Bonechewer Alliance!  :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are a lot of guides up there for gearing up your fresh level 70 resto druid (here's a good one: http://4haelz.blogspot.com/search/label/rl70), but if I were to comment on your gear right now:<br />
<br />
- obviously, work your rep up for the head (Honour Hold - Revered) and shoulder (The Scryers - Revered/Exalted) enchants, these give a huge bonus for any class/spec<br />
<br />
- regem your chest with all healing gems, that socket bonus really isn't worth getting<br />
<br />
- enchant your chest (15 spirit or 6 mp5), bracers (30 healing), gloves (35 healing), weapon (81 healing), and legs (I'd just get the non-epic spellthread for now)<br />
<br />
- you should enchant your feet, but it's kind of a toss-up beween vitality (4 mp5/hp5) or fortitude (12 stam) ... so you can make your own decision here based on what stat you're lacking<br />
<br />
- if you're planning on getting that exalted SSO alchemy trinket ... you should  ;)<br />
<br />
As your gear stands right now, you meet the standard resto druid requirements for entering Kara.  The enchants and regem would really boost your output and make things all that smoother.</div></div><hr />
