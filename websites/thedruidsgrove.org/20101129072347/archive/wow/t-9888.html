It's pretty overwealming.  I'm almost 55, so I'm normally one of the first targets as a results I avoid going into the melee battles. I try to be as much of a support as I can be, normally sit back try to heal the melee, root  and Faerie Fire any rogues or warriors, sleep any hunter pets, and go to bear and charge any runners. Honestly alot of the time I feel I am of no help, although a few times I think I've changed the tide of battle (healed a warrior at almost death who then takes out 2 other people, stunned a priest that everyone took downbefore stun wore off). It seems like this is the best role for me right now. I figured I'm a complete waste if I try to melee or nuke given my level and a heal will keep someone alive that much longer.... Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Of course, that's assuming the melee is actually 'doing' his/her job kicking ass. I hate healing the dumbasses that rush into the front line, but then start backing away when he/she is getting heals. Such a waste of mana for someone who isn't doing much.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, sometimes I just want to have fun, and not sit around drinking for mana. I'll go feral, and refrain from healing unless someone is in dire need. It's more self-serving, but so much more fun, even if we're a lil underpowered vs 60's.</div></div><hr />

 I have to admit that lately this is what I have been doing alot also. I also try to see if I can kite the horde npc officers back to our captain to be killed which has gone quite well lately. Also once we push and take IB and or FW I make sure that their Frostwolf rider commander is kited to our guards and killed whenever he spawns. Thats really got to piss them off.</div></div><hr />
