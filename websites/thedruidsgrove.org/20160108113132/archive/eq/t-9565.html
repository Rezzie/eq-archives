Rolled Discordant Parchment (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=77766) &amp; Discordant Crystal Shard (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=77765) x3 to any regular Priest of Discord or the Elder. Both items are supposed to drop in Dranik's Scar and Bloodfields<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Walls of Slaughter Ports<br />
 <br />
Dark Enchanted Scroll (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=77768) &amp; Pure Discordant Blood (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=77767) x3 to Elder Priest of discord in Dranik's Scar. Both items are supposed to drop in Walls of Slaughter, Muramite Proving Grounds, and Nobles Causeway<br />
 <br />
You will recieve both ring and circle versions when you do the turn ins. Wizards use the same items for their ports. All the quets items are dropable and look like regular vt so might be wise to check the bazaar and also vendors.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Other Spells <br />
 <br />
Minor Muramite Rune - level 66 spells<br />
Lesser Muramite Rune - level 67 spells<br />
Muramite Rune - level 68 spells<br />
Greater Muramite Rune - level 69 spells<br />
Glowing Muramite Rune - level 70 spells<br />
 <br />
Minor, Lesser and regular Muramite Runes (lvl 66 to 68) are tradable. All runes are turned in to Karsor the Mad in Dranik's scar (sw corner of the zone -1650,-40). The spell you recieve should not be a dupe but will be no drop.</div></div><hr />

Me and a BL friend tore through greens for about 30 minutes and got 3 rolled discordant parchments and 2 Discordant Crystals.  I've also seen the Parchments drop from random mobs in WoS.<br />
<br />
The Bloods seem most common in MPG. The Scroll did drop in MPG for a guildy, but seem to be very rare.  A wizard friend gave my mine that dropped in NC.<br />
<br />
Port Locations are:<br />
Bloodfields:  On top of the huge Arch in the middle of the zone. (Very Safe)<br />
WoS:  In the far right turret, on top of the castle wall, in the middle of the zone.  (Very Safe)<br />
<br />
I like the locations of the ports.  WoS is particularily nice because you avoid Grand Central Station, er I mean zone in, where trains run more regularily than Amtrak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">09-20-2004, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was really expecting the WoS port to drop you at the portal room (if you've been there you'll know what I mean), But since there's no way to get up to the port in tower without porting there or levitating over a fairly large gap from the mob occupied part of the wall, it's probably even safer than the portal room. (especially if the portal room is used for some sort of event.</div></div><hr />

Twice now the looter has looted Pure Discordant Blood and wouldn't give it to either me or Wizards for our quest.  Obviously it must be drawing a good price.  Had an Enc looter last night that looted all night including at least two bloods, then when he won a rune it became time for him to leave so he just says bye and poof...</div></div><hr />

A group was killing a named off to the side below the port in.  /sigh <br />

Port in only at full life and I would suggest at least HP buffage to everyone.</div></div><hr />

We also got the blood drops off non Feran mobs.  Sorry, I can't remember if it was the Ukuns, Overseer or Murkglider mobs.<br />
We also got a couple of shards, but those were pretty rare.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I went to DS to get my last shard for the BloodFields port.  We had a shard and a rolled scroll drop in a couple hours.</div></div><hr />
