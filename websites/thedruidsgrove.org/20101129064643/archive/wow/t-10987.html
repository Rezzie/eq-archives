<br />
been a while since ive been on the boards here. I am actaully just in need of venting for a minute.<br />
<br />
I love pvp... absolutely love it. My pain in life is that I am a resto druid for raids and for general play and in pvp i feel like there is no love for a resto druid.<br />
<br />
i know and understand the value of a healer in the bg's and in pvp in general... but just for once i want to do some sick damage. :) <br />
<br />
I am tired of healing rogues and locks and mages etc and seeing their sexy dmg numbers while my crit heals go unnoticed. <br />
<br />
I wish there was a trinket or a talent or soemthing that converted healing spells to dmg... or at least a % of it anyway<br />
<br />
now before you all get all spec feral or moonkin on me--- ive been there and done that. we all know that the purples dont flow for a feral or balance druid the way they do for a resto drood.<br />
<br />
anyway, just wanted to vent... and see if anyone else had the same annoyances that i have.<br />
<br />
please dont flame this potentially whiney post :)<br />
<br />
word,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I suppose we should address the fact your interested in &quot;sick damage&quot;.  Choose your angle.  You say you have done moonkin and feral and not to go there.  It is my opinion that in order to do  one thing very good, in this case &quot;sick damage&quot;, you need to focus your talent at damage.  To do that, you can go balance for spells and focus on your crits and potentially the moonkin aura.  Or if your still wanting to maintain healing efficiency you could go with the 24/0/27 build.  It's not sick damage, but again I think your going to have to go either strong focus into feral damage or spell damage to find what your looking for.  I don't think moonkin is essential to see some great damage.  I have entertained a 30/21/0 build recently that would provide sopme versatility between casting and feral.  <br />
<br />
There have been some recent threads about how a good healer IS loved in BG's.  If your entering the battle grounds with a regular group you'll be appreciated more and your probably going to get noticed more in wsg and AB over AV.  <br />
<br />
People love when druids heal.  And I think you'll find that those who don't understand the damage potential of a druid will wonder why you aren't healing more if your a feral or balance build.  I am feral and love it.  I do some great damage and tank well and charge in for interrupts etc.  But I also make sure I am healing every chance I get.  I am known amongst the people I play with as a very good druid because I don't ignore things like healing just because I am feral.<br />
<br />
I guess you just need ot decide how much you'll be in PVP if you should go with a more efficient build over a focused casting or feral one.  Good luck and just make sure whatever you go with that it's fun for you.  Don't spec for the admiration of others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the most frustrating thing in PvP is dieing. Its fun to do some sick damage but it usually ends up with you dieing to the epic'd T2 premade enemy. I find restoration for PvP great because when I need to do damage and kill someone I just pop ZHC and drop a few starfires and wraths and they die, but I find it even better watching 3 idiots chasing you around with their uber gear and cant kill you. <br />
<br />
I cant imagine how frustrating it must be to watch a druid running around healing people and never dieing. Natures Grasp is awesome for shedding melee off you, travel form is great for getting distance, swiftmend can nullify practically any players damage spikes, etc. <br />
<br />
What you need to do is go find a good premade and run with them. Keep them healed and drop some wraths and starfires when you want some DPS. Nothing makes me feel better than watching a rogue or warrior that cant stand the fact he cant DPS enough to kill you, die to your team. By healing you are filling two roles, you are keeping your team alive and you are actually reducing the amount of damage they are taking because I can garuntee you that you will be fighting for your life every BG once they know you are a good healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for the feedback... like i was saying, i was more just complaining than anything. :)<br />
<br />
I really dont mind being a healer in the bg's have done it for a while and with a good deal of success. I think its just a case of damage envy :-P<br />
<br />
also, i do get frustrated at what i percieve to be a lack of gear for feral and moonkin. Certainly there are obtainable blue items, but i think its very rare that any non-raid spec druid sees non-healing items.<br />
<br />
maybe thats just my server though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gotten tons of epic feral gear from end game instances and will continue to collect it in case it will eventually amount to making me switch to feral completely.<br />
<br />
Healing is more fun and action then doing damage though. I was ready to kill myself running up to molten giant after molten giants spamming shred. I dont know how any melee class can enjoy end game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And thats why I have a 50g respec cost. :eusa_booh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when I specced away from 14/32/5 to 0/30/21.  I wanted that NS.  But I immediately noticed the diminished damage.  The more spread out you are your survivability is great, but you aren't the sick damage.  Like lorath said, that survivability makes all the difference though.  Outlasting counts for a lot.<br />
<br />
Getting that 21 in resto is at such a great cost though.  You lose so much to gain that instant heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres your solution:<br />
<br />
1.  Roll a shadow priest, and go into the BG's and just melt face, and try to top the HK / KB chart, and lose a lot of games, but have fun cause you just wtfpwnt all those people.  When you get tired of losing... see point #2<br />
<br />
2.  Then keep your druid resto, get in a good premade on vent, do what the raid leader tells you (hope that you get in the BS / farm group), heal your little heart out, and win a bunch of games.  When you get tired of healing and want to do some damage... see point # 1</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Main thing about healing in BG's are that the people you heal are usually so bad, it's better to screw healing them and do the job yourself.<br />
<br />
And healers always get complained at anyway, so why even bother. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. :/<br />
<br />
And tbh, healing rogues is always a pain. And you are really not doing them a favour as they should learn to effectively bandage and stealth/eat if they want to improve their skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did a couple pug bg's yesterday with my druid (24/0/27) and for the most part all i did was heal a toss afew moonfires and wraths around. After that I decided that I would never ever pug with the druid again. I will only go with a guild group from now on, because even though I was healing the hell out of those pugs nobody, and I mean nobody came to my aid when I got jumped on. Atleast I know that with the guild they will watch my ass if I keep them going.<br />
<br />
 I also decided that I will quit respecing my druid and stay resto for raiding. I have tried to fight the good fight with feral and or balance, but when your up against the opinions of the player base and the designs of the devs you just cant win. Hell I dont want to win, just compete.<br />
<br />
 My Hunter is lvl 52 now on his way to 60. He will be my pvp character. I thought about doing a shadow priest but then i decided against rolling another healer type to avoid the same old BS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid went all resto, then got pissed trying to farm Silithus.<br />
<br />
I went a slightly different route.  I started a mage to avoid the bitching about not healing but keep the caster role, which I enjoy.<br />
<br />
Next up was, you guessed it:  shadow priest.  I think he's in his 30's.  <br />
<br />
faces, the melting, in PvP, priest of shadow.<br />

It was entertaining.</div></div><hr />
