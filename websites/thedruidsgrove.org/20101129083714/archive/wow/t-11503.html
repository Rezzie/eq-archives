   I have run across a quest (&quot;Lost Master(?)&quot;) in Auberdine which states that I need to bring in 5 fine pelts from Moonstalker Sires or Matrons. So far, in scouring the riverside near the Druids Grove, I have found exactly 1 Moonstalker Sire which did not yield a fine pelt. I waited for him to respawn 6 times, but no joy on the fine pelt. My question is what or where does one need to be to acquire these pelts. I'm a lvl 108 skinner, and lvl 85 leatherworker. <br />

The moonstalkers u need are found far north in darkshore, almost as far north as u can get if i recall it correct.</div></div><hr />

As I travelled North I ran into the PvP White Bear named Grimclaw. It turns out he is part of the second phase of the quest but, more to the point, I found plenty of Sires in the area (on both sides of the road) without the hassle of fighting Matriarchs and her cubs simultaneously. Got the 5 pelts with 12 or 15 kills. (I'm lvl 128 Skinning but never made a fine pelt, they all dropped).</div></div><hr />
