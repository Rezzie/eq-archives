  Check Lucy for stacking, int-casters have self-buffs that it won't stack with, and it doesn't stack with Boon of Recovery and a few other buffs.  Usually you can land it on a tank though.<br />
 <br />
  We had a wizard or two which were usually gaurenteed to get summoned.  I was quite dissapointed I couldn't stick WotW on them because of self buffs.  :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, after the melees have wotw on them (assuming they have room), I always start hitting the people that have a history of being summoned.  At least they'll add another 650 dmg to the raid :)</div></div><hr />
