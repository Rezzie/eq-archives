load up your ice nuke, ice debuff and magic swarm dots, go to the area before FR's ramp, snare the mobs, debuff, nuke and dot.  the aggro range is close to nothing.  there's not a lot to it.  if you have decent resists you can go kill the pink guys too.<br />
 <br />
I'd give you some quad kiting advice but your mana pool wouldn't hold up to it.</div></div><hr />

For quadding I'd guess close to a 10k pool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT, its slow as hell, you have to resnare stuff, and med kite...a lot. Its much faster and easier to do 1 at a time with smaller manapools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seeker</div><div class="date">05-22-2006, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started quadding tables with just under 6k mana and each quad would take around 25-30 mins (resnare, med kite and long med before next).<br />
<br />
The biggest difference was when I looted an Orb of Clinging Death from Time. On each circuit of tables I would use Orb on each member of the quad and cast 2 rain spells. Time for each quad was halved and it was much easier on mana as half of the damage was from the clicky dot.<br />
<br />
Once I hit 66+ I switched to using Tempest Wind, slightly less efficient but I never saw a wave resisted.</div></div><hr />

Make sure you resnare ASAP and try and keep them together as much as possible.  I saw another druid one time had four in all different parts of tables camp and died about twenty seconds later cause he had no where to kite.  Was kinda funny and sad at the same time.</div></div><hr />
