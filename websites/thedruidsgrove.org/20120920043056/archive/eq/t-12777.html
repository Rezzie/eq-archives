Man I really have to get that aa now. I was going to ask about it but it doesn't pay now someone beat me to it. I must say this is the funniest board I have been on since I started playing EQ.  Your group was wrong for not healing you hehe. <br />
 <br />
Could this be used to keep you alive when raiding and the Mob has a AE and how much below 0 can you be with this aa before you see <br />

Delay Death = 50hp per rank - 5 ranks<br />
Prolonged Mortality = 50 hp per rank - 5 ranks<br />
<br />
max total of 500 hp below 0</div></div><hr />

Probably not the first batch of things I'd buy but when you have enough AAs it does have value.<br />
 <br />
Last week killing King in RS, had some loose bombs blow up, knocked me to -475 hp, so of course I fall over unconscious and I'm laying there.  No healers around but I regened enough hp and was spam hitting my instant cast 2K AA heal so it would heal as soon as I could and poof I got back up and lived.<br />
 <br />
Again its rare but kind of fun.  Also fun in duels when you fall below 0 hp, they think you are dead (but you aren't) and you pop back up, heal yourself and finish them off, haha, that is fun stuff.</div></div><hr />

Has saved me on a few occasions, but you have to rely on reciving heals from others in most cases (re: low hp aggro.)  <br />
 <br />
However, in group situations for tank classes it's a very useful aa.<br />

I think its<br />

You can go unconsious without those aa's...so it's more than 500.</div></div><hr />
