 <br />
I am currently a lvl 73 druid with all expansions upto and including TSS (no TBS or SoF).  I regulary duo with mage (pretty much the same level and gear that I have) and pretty much charm kite in icefall to level-up.  My magelo profile is:<br />

I am not in a guild and only play casually, I was just wondering if anyone had some suggestions for some easily obtainable gear/augs that I could get with my mage partner.  Also any AA suggestions would also be appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Ive been away for a while and could really use some suggestions on easily obtainable (solo or duoing with mage) augs/gear. and AAs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daldaen</div><div class="date">04-14-2008, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, your best bets for upgrades are in the jewelry slots I'd suggest some Dwerium jewelry (namely earring and ring for you) put some Pear cut Prestidigtase, Harmonagate, Taaffeite (in order from cheapest to most expensive).  Also get some round cut Emeralds(150mana aug for these pieces) and Opals(150hp augs for these pieces).  Here is a link to a website that calculates the stats of the gear you could make (Dwerium Trio) http://www.kyros.info/Tradeskills/JC-Calc/ <br />
Other than that as for your secondary if you don't need the focus (didn't check your gear to see if you had other foci of this line) you could do 69.1 for a Blood defender -&gt; http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=44733<br />
If you happen to get TBS or SoF your options of soloable or duoable gear will expand.  For example you can easily duo upgrades in SoF for example Chiliform Necklace, Moonlight Cape, Flail of Redemption, Drape of the Waterborn etc. there are countless upgrades you could get there with the mage pet tanking and you healing him.  As for leveling up and AAs Icefall is your best bet, the swarm kiting exp there is the best you will get solo, if duo swarm kite but have your mage friend burn down the mob that gets on low health and sic his pet (preferably Earth one so he can root it and get it away from the pack so it doesn't die or mabye Air for stun).  As for some AA device, I'd suggest getting the two mana regen lines maxed for your level, Expansive Mind and Mental Clarity.</div></div><hr />
