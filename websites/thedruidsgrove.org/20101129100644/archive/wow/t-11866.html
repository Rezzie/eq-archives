NS and Swiftmend would make you nearly as good as you can get.  For healing end game...both gear and skill are more important than spec.  As for treeform.....it's a great healer....and fills the role in the raid of the emergency swiftmender/mitigation heal over time healer amazingly.  HoTs are very important on a raid tank to mitigate incoming damage....and druids do that better than anyone.  However....druids don't have to be treeform to be end game healers.  There's a healing touch build that makes you very much like a paladin/priest healer using a mix of resto (up through swiftmend) and balance (up through dreamstate) talents to be a super healing touch spammer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elziban</div><div class="date">07-09-2007, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">39 points is probably enough to make you a good pvp healer, probably even a good instance healer.  Your challenge will come when you have to throw HoTs on a raid during a boss fight.  The tree form's mana efficency comes in very handy there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">07-09-2007, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two 'schools' of Druid Healing. Tree healing and 'everyone else' healing. If you are a tree, you are using HoTs exclusively and you have all the bells and whistles to make them mana efficient. If you are not a tree, your 'go to' heal spell is Healing Touch.  It's been my experience that trees are great in raids, but weaker in 5-man groups. Why? Boss fights can be bursty, and sometimes you need to be able to lay a big heal on your tank, and pronto.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. I agree with others, 39 points in Resto is more than sufficient for 5-man level 70 instance healing. Healing is as much (if not more) about gear and skill as it is spec.</div></div><hr />

The trick to healing as a feral or any other build is to build a good healing set.  I think my healing set is currently at somewhere around +800.  I think that's a little low, but I think part of that is because as a feral, I don't have the supporting talents to add mana efficiency and bonus healing as much.</div></div><hr />

Assuming you are a primarily a feral (tank) with at least a 0/42/11 (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zZxGGscboezioVx0z) build (minimum tank build?!?!), but have the need to heal from time-to-time where would you put your remaining 8 points?  In Feral or in Restro?<br />
<br />
Is Nurturing Instinct worth it?  Seems like most healing kits wouldn't have all that much +strength.  So, how much actual +healing would you gain from this talent?  What is your strength while wearing your healing kit?<br />
<br />
If you were to put the 8 additional points in Restro, where would they go?<br />
<br />
Would you put any of the 8 points in feral for extra Cat DPS for times when you are not asked to tank or heal (solo quests, etc.)?  Savage Fury?  Shredding Attacks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">07-20-2007, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heal fairly well as feral, I have just over +1200 to healing now, although I was healing 70 instances (non heroic) just fine with like +900 I think.  As long as your tank's good and your DPSers are fairly decent, you should be fine.  I've found I like Intensity in my feral build, for both the enrage ability plus the help it gives me when I heal.  But that's as far down as I go.  :)<br />
<br />
I haven't tried nuturing instinct yet, I was honestly kind of turned off from it because I tend to mix-max my gear sets and just change gear sets between pulls if need be... like when I do DPS I wear all my str/agi/+hit gear, when I heal I wear all my int/+heal/mp5 gear, etc.  I do have a tank/DPS hybrid gear set, but other than that... yeah, I'd never want to use str stuff for healing, it just doesn't seem natural to me.  If I'm DPSing and the healer goes down, I'll pop out, heal my butt off, innervate myself if need be, pop a mana pot if need be, brez if it's during a boss fight, and we usually survive just fine, even in a heroic.  Lifebloom's so nice even as feral with no +healing gear on, it can really save the day.  If I'm main healing, then I'm throwing on all my healing gear to make sure I have as much +healing and mana as I can (I don't use cloth either, because it's amazing what you can survive through if you just shift to bear during rough spots).<br />
<br />
I know some druids use nuturing instinct, I just personally think it doesn't fit my playstyle.  I never used any Moonglade either, though some druids swear by it.  Each to their own.  :)  I guess I'm more of a min-maxer than a lot of druids, but I think I do okay in PvE.  I don't pvp much for the record, may be why I suck at it. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

The Mana regen from intensity along with the reduced mana cost of all heals from moonglow added together with a good +healing set all makes for a capable healer, many balance talants benefit both damage and healing by a flat percentage or based on int.  I have since retired my druid for a full protection Paladin but have been thinking of going back to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact is; yes you can heal without tree form, but your mana efficiency is greatly affected.</div></div><hr />

I find myself focusing more on Feral, rather than healing, rewards and should really start accumulating my healing set.</div></div><hr />

Assuming, of course, a &quot;real&quot; healer doesn't need it.<br />
<br />
I would assume this is common practice for most Druid tanks.  Or for that mater, Druid healers who are acquiring Feral gear.</div></div><hr />

I have a pretty nice heal set on my druid, and while I was resto for a while in Kara, more of it came from heroics while I was tanking LOL.</div></div><hr />
