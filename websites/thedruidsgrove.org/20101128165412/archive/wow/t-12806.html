<br />
Im a new resto druid. I have done kara, mags, grulls, TK and SSC. I am sorry to say that it seems ive been a bit carried. I have around 1300 unbuffed plus to heals, and i know this needs to get higher. So im here looking for some help.  this is my armory page.<br />

I have replaced the neck piece today with a badge piece.  Though I cant think of the name of it. I use grid and click for my healing mods. Any help on what i can improve would be nice. and yes  i know i need a better healing weapon, if one would only drop.  Thanks for the all the help.<br />

<br />
Badge off hand ( voodoo shaker I think it's called? ).<br />
<br />
I'd pug Kara when you can to get the exalted ring and a few shots at loot off of Prince ( mace and cloak ).<br />
<br />
Or one of the cloaks off badges, but I'm not a huge fan of those.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)</div></div><hr />

I just got revered with the VE and my guild still runs kara for badges.  SO that is on my list of things to get.  <br />
<br />
And if the hammer would just drop off of prince, that would be so nice.</div></div><hr />

my advice to you is to get some golden spellthread for your pants and get the glyph from honorhold on your helm and also the inscription from your faction on your shoulders im aldor so it is the inscription of faith also gems gems gems get healing gems not stamina gems also mp5 is your best friend so get as much spirit as possible also use elixer of healing power and elixer of dreanic wisdom as well as golen fish sticks for food while in a raid they will be your best friend</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">09-04-2008, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get the +66 healing spellthread for your pants. (http://thottbot.com/i24276)<br />
 <br />
Get some +heal / +spirit gems (http://thottbot.com/i32836)<br />
 <br />
Get the Glyph of Renewal from Thrallmar revered (http://thottbot.com/i29190) - looks like you only need 1 more run to get Revered.<br />
 <br />
Get the Essence of the Martyr Trinket for 41 badges (http://thottbot.com/i29376)<br />
 <br />
If you can't get the hammer from Prince, the S2 PvP healing mace with a +heal enchant is nice. Total healing on it with the enchant is +504 (no spirit or mp5 tho :( )<br />
 <br />
Just getting the helm enchant, mace (and enchant) and the spellthread for your pants will give you an extra +328 healing, putting you at a respectable 1560. With the trinket you will be up to +1648 healing. With some re-gemming you should be able to get close to +1700</div></div><hr />
