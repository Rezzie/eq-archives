<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madie of Wind Riders</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As many of you know, I only started visiting this board about 2 months ago. I had actually used the original Druids Grove years ago but thought it had died. A friend of mine from Tunare actually told me about the serverwide channel and it was there I found out about this board.<br />
 <br />
I wanted to say how extremely impressed I am with the many druids here. The amount of information already posted regarding PoR is simply mind blowing. I find it extremely exciting that there are so many of you running around and trying to figure out quests, tasks, spells, arcs.... just astounding.<br />
 <br />
Thank you all for your reports back! I have had the expansion a bit over 24 hours and have visited the new Freeport (which I am still KoS in) and retrieved my new teleports (thanks Fenier for the info!) Other than that, I have spoke to a few NPC's and ventured about 50 yards in Arcstone. Hehehe I am nearly jealous of those of you who have already completed so much!</div></div><hr />

I'm very proud of being part of this community and our class. Thank you all for making it so enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

We now know a little bit more of what to look for so it seems to be coming faster.<br />
 <br />
Also, there is a new quest(s) to fix Freeport faction.  The low level/low faction ones seem to be working but I am hearing reports that the high level/high faction mod ones are buggy.</div></div><hr />

Just a note about that faction quest.<br />
 <br />
Unless they fixed it the NPC outside the gates to FP in North Ro tells you the 2 NPC's that give the quest are in North Ro. In fact they are in South Ro.<br />
 <br />
I spent some time running around before I checked out South Ro.<br />
