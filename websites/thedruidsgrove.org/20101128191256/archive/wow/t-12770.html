<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimjonn</div><div class="date">08-10-2008, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm happily running through Tek Forest trying to rescue survivors that have been cocooned by spiders. I say let them die, but no one asked me. A little birdie tells me there is a quest to kill spiders that one should do at the same time. Great! I find a little birdie (no, not the same one) and accept a quest, presumably to kill said spiders.<br />
<br />
He says, &quot;Great! Let's go.&quot; and runs off.<br />
<br />
What? But...but....okay, I'm game. It runs towards these bird-like mobs. No worries. I can go through those mobs faster than Annikk goes through Felweed. We kill the two up the path, and before I can heal or rebuff it runs off. Ungrateful little twit. The next mob I maim to give me time to heal. It wants to be difficult, I can be difficult too. This continues as we run up ramps and kill stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to keep up you'd better jump off.&quot;<br />
<br />
What?? I don't want to jump off. You can't make me. Okay, I'll do it. Oops, should I have landed on that bridge? Damn it, I'm at the bottom. Mobs aggroing. Bet I've failed the quest. Stupid bird. Oh there it is, trying to help. Kill, kill. Okay, let's find out where it is. Sneak, sneak...oh look, it's at 30% health. Kill, heal, all is good. When will this thing stop?<br />
<br />
At some point it stops. Great! A mob appears. Oh look, it's a 65 elite. HOLY FRACK! It's gonna eat me! Faerie fire! Mangle! Change my underwear! No wait, can't do that yet. It's a caster! I'm doomed! Wow, it really can't deal with a combat kittie. Maim, heal, shred. I might live. YES! I will live and then I will eat the bird. Yes, the mob is dead! Where's that bird?? Oh, I guess it flew off. <br />
<br />
Whaddya mean, that was a two-person quest??</div></div><hr />

The inner monologue of cat droods is so funny :p<br />

I didn't do that quest until I was 70 and I was only doing it for Lower City rep so I could get my heroic key for Seth Halls so it was a bit easier because I could fly but it was still annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
Nice job on soloing the elite mob while caught off guard. =D</div></div><hr />
