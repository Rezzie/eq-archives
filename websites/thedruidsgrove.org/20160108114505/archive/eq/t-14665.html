Was thinking about frogs, but did them so long I'm looking for some new options. My magelo is in my sig (the flags/keys part of the new magelo still isn't updating yet, but I've got alot so any suggestions are welcome).<br />

<br />
Here are a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
HoH basements either quadding if your mana can handle it or I liked agro kiting with the DC young wrylong.<br />
<br />
Noble's Causeway - Murkgliders in the ditch near DS zone line might be around lvl 61ish.  But the Murkglider Stingers near the Ukun named are 64-65 I think.<br />
<br />
Vxed instance - there is a guide posted somewhere.<br />
<br />
Got FIRE flag?  quadding is easy at the tables just beyond castle 2.<br />
<br />
DODH - the Lost notebook is name of the 69.1 spell arch mission.  The Hard mission has mobs conning yellow at 71.  But the easy mission had them conning DB, so that might be doable for you as well - just need to ghetto split the mobs at start.<br />
<br />
DON - Nest instances were also good solo grounds but I'm not sure if the mob levels are based on people that get the mission or what.  They always seemed to con 70+ for 70+ groups.<br />
<br />
GL to you Inthuul!</div></div><hr />

Will also look into the others. Thanks for the suggestions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fire Dots definitely won't work in Doomfire.  Use Winged Death and Swarming Death (orb from Time works very well if you have one).  I also use the Drones of Doom from ES Vambraces and epic on occasion.  Once you hit 68, Wasp Swarm is a huge upgrade for our magic dots.<br />
<br />
Oh - and bring BOO BOO out for a little extra DPS - can't hurt.<br />
<br />
Quadding advice in Fire - Once you hit 66, use the cold rain Tempest Wind instead of Karana's Rage.  The magic AE nuke gets partially / fully resisted where as the cold Rain nuke won't get resisted at all, even w/out debuffing.</div></div><hr />
