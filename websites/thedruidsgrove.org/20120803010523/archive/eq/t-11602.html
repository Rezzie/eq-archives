I am stuck at lvl 57 (well i will be 57 after about 10 more kills).....I know lvl 70 is not realistic due to my play time being limited and the fact i only solo.<br />
Does anyone have any good methods or places used for solo when they were level 57 to get to 60. I just want to accomplish level 60 and I will be happy. From there I will worry about getting higher.<br />
I have been doing the Oths and Umbral Plains and they have gotten so boring, plus even though the Oths are blue, my bar doesnt seem to move too quick when camping them.</div></div><hr />

Level 59 druid and I get 1 percent xp or 4 percent aaxp a kill root/rotting the level 55 sun revenants in a nice safe camp with single pulls.  I can do 4 of the 6 spawns around the lake before the first repops -- they are on a 17 minute timer.<br />
<br />
Of course there is the old standby of charming stalkers in plane of nightmare.<br />

good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">06-24-2005, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ad I forgot about the Raptors. I remember doing them when I just turned lvl 56. I was using a Lummy Staff at the time to help with the &quot;multi-quadding&quot;.<br />
But stupid me was half asleep at 3am one night and I accidently sold my Lummy Staff to a vendor thinking it was Fine Steel. I realized the error 3 days later. I gave up quadding after that.<br />
But I will give them a shot again. <br />
How is Broodlands for a lvl 57.......are those Rock Dervs decent exp? I recall a named mob called Sandpaw nearby as well who conned blue in Broodlands..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">06-25-2005, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several options:<br />
<br />
Raptors in TD. I tried several methods, the fastest was to charm the 3 vicious ones to kill the others. While your pet (hasted and DSed) is fighting, you ride a horse (to save mana) and root+snare 3-4 raptors one by one, dot them with level 44 spell + mana free DOD. After 3 or so fights, kill the pet, grab another.<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief yard junk (do not touch the named), and the rascals on the bridge (better exp but worse pathing). At 57 the fastest method is agro-kiting with a charmed skunk doing damage. Note that not all skunks are chamable with level 52 spell. Root-dot also works but slower. Bonus exp in this zone since you are 55+ and the mobs are mostly within 5 levels of you (51-55). DEFINITELY come here once you get to level 58 -- now you find a skunk to charm and you can almost wipe the entire forest (You got level 58 heal to keep your pet alive).<br />
<br />
PON raven/werewolf. Charm kite. Raven gives better exp per kill, but for werewolf you can kill both the pet and another mob (no worry of running out of pets), so I prefer werewolves. Use harmony of nature a lot.<br />
<br />
POD charm a disease rat and kill the other mobs. Rats are tougher than other mobs so you kill fast. However the ground is hilly so I don't like it. Finding a rat is also not very easy (but not difficult either).<br />
<br />
Blackpaw gnoll cave (deep inside) in Japperedpine. Root-doting while on horseback make it a nobrainer. Exp is moderate. Some casters see through invis, making it trickier to get in.</div></div><hr />

What do you do when folks say aggro kiting? Does it  involved charming? What type of tactic do you use for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dari</div><div class="date">06-25-2005, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get a mob really mad at you so it chases you instead of your charmed pet. That way your pet takes no damage while he smacks the hell outta the mob from behind and you don't have to heal the pet. Just snare and dot your target and keep it dotted and chasing you while your pet smacks away at it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildan</div><div class="date">06-25-2005, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have your curse/fire dot from Ldon that generates some nice agro as does  debuffs.<br />
<br />
Another great agro spell for you is Fury of Air. Stun nukes tend to upset mobs. I LOVE em!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">06-25-2005, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And do not forget to turn off pet taunt when agro kiting. Plane of Mischief does not have a formal zone-out. It has a tree which teleports you to CS underwater. The tree is in the middle of the yard. You want to have a good COV faction to use this emergent exit since rarely there is a giant fish-dragon (level 60) in CS swims around your port-out spot.</div></div><hr />

Any other mobs to kill to gain positive faction with CoV?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">06-25-2005, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to kill a lot, I mean a lot! Takes forever! Better tag to an AOW raid in Kael.<br />
<br />
In EW there are 3 orge mercenries who give 'big' positive COV faction. (northeast of the map, the jail area). That is the only spot in EW. Other spots are the western half of Kael and WL.</div></div><hr />

Any other mobs to kill to gain positive faction with CoV?<br />
<br />
Somthing like 2000 giants in GD. Kael mobs are much better.<br />
Another tip is giants without beards give more faction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">06-26-2005, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just used Ensnare at that level. I was charm fighting in Nadox at about your level also. I'll poke around and see if I can find the post I made at this time. Make sure you're using Glamour of Tunare if you're charming, you can get it from someone selling in Bazaar or through a quest in FV.<br />

Here's my thread, from when I was stuck at 49. There should be some good ideas there, http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=10181</div></div><hr />

Mobs move a tad slower however its a much shorter duration. I see no reason to use this honestly.</div></div><hr />
