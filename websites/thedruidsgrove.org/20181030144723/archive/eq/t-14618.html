So here is another aug to help the casual players with information on a higher lvl focus item (ie works up to lvl 75)<br />
 <br />
The quest is again in Valdeholm however you don't need it to gather the items.<br />

They definitely drop from the gnolls around Chef.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, there are three ways to do this quest. As noted above you have to collect the 4 &quot;Torn Pages&quot; that identify differently from one another. Another way is to collect the 3 &quot;Tattered Scrolls&quot; that identify differently from one another, OR, you can collect the 2 &quot;Bundle of Brittle Parchment&quot; that also identify differently from one another. All these parchments, Tattered and Brittle, drop from the same darkfell gnolls that drop the Torn Pages also. They combine in the book given to you by Fenegar, to make the Ancient Book, which you then hand to him for your reward. <br />
<br />
So don't let those other parchments rot, cause in some cases it's easier to collect 2 than 4 ;). <br />

Calidore Amore'Eterno <br />
Knight of Mystic Coercion <br />
TinMan of Erollisi Marr<br />
<br />
<br />
Wish I'd seen this before I finished the quest... I ended up with all 3 tattered scrolls, both brittle parchments and 2 torn pages.  <br />
<br />
Long story short, Lujayne's comment about the parchments on the giants is very valid, and don't just look for torn pages.  You can have several people in a group work this quest at once, collecting different item types.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">10-19-2006, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just thought id share my thoughts on this and my personal experiences. we camped the gnolls for 3 days:<br />
<br />
day 1 : camped lower plateau south of tunnel connecting gnolls and giants for 5 hours...all lite blue ,low level cons<br />
Found : none<br />
<br />
day 2 : camped druid rings for 5 hours ..about 50% lite blue low level and about 50% dark blue captains,sharpshooters,etc.<br />
Found : 1 page,1 tattered scroll,1 brittle parchment<br />
<br />
day 3 : camped extreme northeast corner of zone next to the giant murals for 5 hours..all dark blue sharphooters,captains,other hi level /con gnolls<br />
Found : 4 pages,5 brittle parchments,3 tattered scrolls<br />
<br />
we might have been lucky but this seems to have a better drop chance from higher level gnolls (shamans,captains,sharpshooters,etc.) we had the same group each time (just me and a friend) and we used the same toons and had the same kill speed..abt 1 kill every 2 mins average.<br />
<br />
again we might have just been unlucky at the other camps or just lucky at our last camp because i have seen the posts says all gnolls can drop them. havent tried giants but thats just my theory : maybe higher level gnolls drop more often.<br />
<br />
also..anyone know what the diseased fish is for? i recieved a diseased fish on completion of this task..</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the quests, Sweeping the Steppes: Gnolls.  Resulted in a tattered page dropping from 2 out of the three elite gnolls that spawn at the end of the quest.<br />
<br />
I have written up the quest and it is now on Allah's:-<br />

I hope this helps, and I hope this wasn't just me being very lucky.</div></div><hr />
