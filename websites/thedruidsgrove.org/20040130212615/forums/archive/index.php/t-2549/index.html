<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saffun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the advent of ldon i was wondering if anyone thinks this aa is worth it.<br />
It adds a little mana free damage during an adventure so it can't be that bad. Still 9 points is 9 points that could be spent somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Ps. i noticed on lucy there does seems to be one line of rune spells that they didn't block from stacking with wrath of teh wild.<br />
The beserker line which caps out at level 64 with a 425 point rune. Enchanters get this line and my best eq bud is a chanter and perhaps we can use this when we are farming lower level mobs or something.<br />
<br />
Anyone with this skill ever see if that type of rune will go on top of our aa rune?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WoTW basically represents to me, 700 dmg / 240 seconds or about 2-3 dps.  But its storable, if your about to fight a rampaging named mob, you can cast it on a few people or better yet, PETS to eat rampage and jump up dps.<br />
<br />
10 Pets into an AE rampage could do 7000 damage with this.  Dunno about 9 points for it though  =\<br />
<br />
Iegil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">WoTW is basically a druids version of Manaburn.  Same dmg per time, I'm going to train it after I max my healing abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Was thinking this myself the other day,  I guess if you spread the damage out over the whole time it takes to reset it is very low but it is free and every bit helps.<br />
<br />
2 DPS per second over 90 minutes = 10800 damage.  And thats for mana free.<br />
<br />
Hell I even cast out Booboo these days just to help things along a little.  Remember EVERY single damage point can help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Manaburn matters because it is big burst dmg.  This isn't.<br />
<br />
This is extremely low dps.  I have toyed with the pre-load idea (iirc, the spell lasts for 30min, and has a 4 min recast).  But even with that you have to be in a situation where each of the people or pets who gets it cast on them is going to be hit...otherwise it is just going to be that one time dmg the MA does.  And it uses a buff slot which most people don't have to spare.<br />
<br />
The recast on it means that the total dmg in an hour is actually only 9750.  60 min/4min x 650 dmg.  Works out to 2.7dps.  <br />
<br />
I really see no value in this skill, and I think we got screwed.  All the other AA dmg options do big dmg less frequently, and that is a much, much more valuable model.  It is best to think of this just as the 2-3 dps as suggested above...that is all it will amount to.  Or you could look at it as a small mana free nuke you could do every 4 fights.<br />
<br />
Now, if you PVP a lot, it might be more valuable....but I hate PVP so...<br />
<br />
I don't see myself getting this skill within the next 100 aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently fought Phinigel again and saw something surprising with Wrath of the Wild...<br />
<br />
Phinigel nuked me from a distance, and I took a small amount of damage from the spell.  This damage made Wrath of the Wild go away without Phinigel taking the 650 damage.<br />
<br />
I thought &quot;Absorb Damage&quot; (as opposed to &quot;Absorb Magic Damage&quot;) effects were only supposed to absorb melee damage?  Shouldn't Wrath of the Wild have stayed up until Phinigel swung at me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fayne Dethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is one of the most worthless AAs, hands down.  I originally got it because it used to stack with the enchanter's self runes.   Thus, a chanter could keep re-runing himself against a slowed mob, and the mob would take a good amount of damage (unslowed, a chanter couldnt keep up).   As soon as they nerfed that ability, the AA went from being useful in select situations to utterly worthless - wow 2 dps extra damage!!!  <br />
<br />
Really this AA needs looking at.   Make it into big burst damage like shaman and mage mass pet thing, or make it a percentage based damage shield that lasts 30 seconds.   Or better yet to help combat the huge aggro of druid spells and the fact that druids have no means to reduce aggro, turn it into a jolt AA useable only every 3 minutes.   I think our aggro is too out of whack - one nuke often times leads to summoning/death if you have done any healing or dotting, while wizards can literally chain nuke as long as they dont start off with their 3k nuke ;p (even more extreme if they have elemental pants).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Exploits aside, this AA ability is the most worthless piece of crap I have ever seen.  Druid manaburn?  Puh-leeze, next you'll tell me that druids meleeing with a rusty dagger is &quot;Druid Manaburn&quot; since it does about the same damage.  Even putting aside the AA points, I wouldn't even bother to waste a hotkey bank slot for this thing.<br />
<br />
To improve this skill, I suggest they just make it a regular damage shield equal to Shield of Bracken (maybe a group version), with the advantage that it costs no mana or spell slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">OMG, Swarm of Ents I'm telling you!<br />
<br />
Like those little angry saplings in Takish!!!!<br />
<br />
Yes, so cute, so druid...that is what we need!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Poitez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd love if they just broke Wrath of the Wild and Spirit of the Wood into two seperate skills, one that is a group heal over time, and the other is a short duration AC/DS boost.  Basically just SotW(a) Heal but no DS/AC, and SotW(b) DS/AC no healing.  Ideally with like 15 min or so recast each.<br />
<br />
Other than that though WotW is utterly useless; it needs to be changed drastically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Only time Wrath of the Wild was any use was when it stacked with Arcane Rune. As it is now, it's pretty much worthless, and I only click it because it's there. I'd like a swarm pet in place of it really =-p<br />
<br />
A normal damage shield wouldn't be so bad I guess. Though I'd kinda rather it not be a group version, so I could use it on pets. Same reason the effect on elemental legs is kinda eh.. only time I want to use group DS is when I'm in LDoN, and I'm rarely there so =-(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oldoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would NOT have a swarm pet to replace it.  My guild often forbids swarm pets on raid mobs because for some reason those little things seem to be able to push like 100 players.<br />
<br />
There are times when that push is useful, but most often it just screws things up.  PLus it adds a lot of lag when you see a billion dogs, elementals, and swords flying around already.<br />
<br />
I liked the suggestion above about just making it a manafree DS.  I would prefer it to be a DS that stacked with other DS's, and had a shortish duration.<br />
<br />
My best stab at it would be something like:<br />
<br />
DS dmg: 250<br />
Duration 6 ticks<br />
Reset: 20 minutes<br />
<br />
Some assumptions:<br />
<br />
http://oldietree.com/misc/wotwtable.jpg <br />
<br />
In experience groups, the skill would be lower impact because the mobs will hit less per round.  On raids, the tank will be a defensive warrior so again they will tend to be hit less.  Only &quot;risk&quot; would be a strong flurrying mob.  Not sure the consequences then.<br />
<br />
Like Manaburn and Lifeburn, this effectively means one druid at a time could do it   They could build in the same kind of delay factor they use on those skills so that even if it is 6 ticks you can't put the DS on the tank again in less than 10ticks or something.  At any rate, I think this would be more in line with what I hear the swarm pets do, probably even a good chunk lower.  The maximum impact I have hear on any given fight is a 6k dmg hit, and that would basically never happen (or hardly ever) since it would mean the tank got hit 4x per melee round for a full 6 ticks.  Usually I htink it would fall in at the 3750range, and so in aggregate would be just about the same damage per hour that the current ability is, but it would actually be worth using since doing 3750 on one mob is worth investing in while doing 650 on that same mob is not.<br />
<br />
EDIT....Feh, I was hoping tables would be easier now.  Someday I will figure out how to do them. <br />
<br />
EDIT2... If you can't do it the &quot;right&quot; way, cheat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macnbaish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree that as it is it's pretty useless, and I haven't even purchased it yet.  Maybe that's not right but I can't think of a single decent use for it really... what would be neat I think would be maybe a higher powered single target version of our normal DS... say 100hp with a duration of about ten minutes and recast of like.. 20 minutes.  The kicker here is that DS damage is credited to the person wearing the DS!  This would be awesome for tanks that want to build aggro early in the fight.. at the very least it certainly wouldn't hurt.  I think it would be a type of new aggro modifier and even help our desirability in raids and exp groups. Controlling aggro = good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>alyn cross</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i like it.<br />
<br />
but then when you are over 150aa, most skills are just fluff, you've got the ones you 'desired' already... so for fluff, 650pts every 4 minutes is cool... i enjoy seeing how high i can actually get that one shot ds... think we had a guy over 820 one xp group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rahjeir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I never saw much use in getting that AA skill. Maybe when I hit the 400 mark, I'll buy it for kicks. I still have 300AA till that point though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Matafleur Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wouldn't call WoTW useless. It is a handy free 650 point damage shield that stacks with our other damage shields. I use it in exp groups and on raids on the MT. Extra damage especially free damage is good damage in my book.<br />
<br />
It's certainly not an AA I would buy right off the bat but definately one to buy after you have done your healing AA's, SCR, SCRM, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bismuth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">WotW certainly isn't our best AA, but it might help to put it into perspective.  If you take a look at the mana:damage ratios on one of our PoP nukes, the damage produced from WotW3 is equivalent to three or four points of flowing thought (assuming you continually have a target on which to apply it).<br />
<br />
For a druid in the business of dealing damage, 9AA's invested into WotW3 will be more effective than spending those same points into Mental Clarity.<br />
<br />
Of course, extra points of flowing thought are a bit more versatile for how the mana can be used.  Anyway, I think people are coming down on this skill a bit too hard, since just about every skill after the core few (SCM3, SotW3, perhaps ND3, etc.) are about as marginal an upgrade as this one is.  It really comes down to what your playstyle is and how many points you want to invest into one skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Muskratt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The only reason I can see myself ever getting this is for PVP action. Most melees are going to expect to have a 30-50pt DS on a druid, but not a 650 that refreshes every (4?) minutes?<br />
<br />
On a non-crit nuke that doesn't land for full, this can stand right up to it in damage.<br />
<br />
Too bad though, it takes 9 points to become useful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sentis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">First, I have to say, I loved that idea of a booboo grenade. A targeted cruise missile of nature, I love it, its classic.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as I see it, there are two easy ways to vastly improve this skill and make it worth the 9 aa points it takes to get. <br />
1. make it a group spell. Same damage, same recast delay, etc etc, but hits the entire group. Now you can get some decent damage frm it in an exp group, AND you can MGB it on a raid and get some mileage from it there too.<br />
2. Increase the number of hits it lasts based on its level. i.e at lvl 1, it works as it works now, one hit and its gone, at lvl 2, it lasts for two hits, and at lvl 3, it lasts for 3 hits. <br />
<br />
Either of the above would be simple, effective, not overpowering, and would make the skill at least useful. BTW, I think that they should do both, and then the skill would be highly useful.<br />
<br />
As it is, I have lvl 3 wraith of the wild, and the most useful benifit I get from it is that I no longer have to fight anoying greenies while waiting for ldon groups. <br />
i.e. annoying green skeleton walks up and smack me, and dies.<br />
<br />
p.s. one possible way to get some entertainment value from lvl 3 wotw, would be to charm a black wolf in a newbie zone, cast wotw on it, and break charm. <br />
I of course woudl never do this. well, maybe in nekulos forest, those dark elves have it coming anyway :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fairweather Pure</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I appreciate WotW and it indeed helps me as a druid.  650 is not much when held on it's own, but the dmg is unresistable and goes a long way in adding additional dmg to any encounter.  As a long time soloer, it has helped me to defeat MoBs that I would otherwise have died to because of interrupts.  It's great for any sort of farming, including soloing VT shards, tradeskills, or plan ol' plat farming.  Before going into an adventure in LDoN, I hit as many people in my group as I can before the adventure starts.  That's 3900 dmg before the the first shot is thrown.<br />
<br />
I also use it to finish off MoBs that I am root/rotting and they're almost dead, and all my DoTs wear off.  Instead of reapplying DoTs, I just walk to them and they finish themself on my Wotw.  I also notice that, as always, tanks appreciate a 650 hit out of the blue.<br />
<br />
WoTW also makes me feel a bit better about those partial nukes/resists.  I know at leat 650 is getting through.  I can also mentally add it to my dmg per MoB, whenever it is used.  Even a non-critical Winters Frost jumps from 1550 to 2200 when a WotW is cast.<br />
<br />
Also, when I am lom and have to med, or I am strictly healer, I can throw out 650 dmg every 4 minutes for free.  Hey, it make me happy.  Especially when using a charmed MoB while soloing, I think the 650 DS indeed helps take enemies down faster and helps push that little blue bar.<br />
<br />
Before any Boss MoB in LDoN, the tanks has, at the very least, my DS (40), WotW (650), and SotW on pull (55) for a total of 745 for the first hit.  Many times I have a second WotW waiting to be cast as soon as the first hit lands.<br />
<br />
I've said it before that druids are all about micromanagment if you want to be the best that you can be.  Every little bit adds up and has an impact at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My typical targets for storing this DS are the tank, sometimes the puller or shaman, depending on their buff space, and once we are rolling i try cast it everytime it's up while the mob is wailing away.  (thus, its only on the person for a second or two.)  It's great because there is no delay in the cast...  i can nuke Winter's frost, immediately followup with this AA while spells are refreshing, then nuke again.  1550, 650, 1550. Sweet.<br />
<br />
A few days ago i was xp'ing in BoT,  our tank went linkdead so our bard had to tank the mob unexpectedly. I threw this on him near the end to finish the mob up quickly, mob went boom, and the bard exclaimed &quot;Wow, thorns burst out of my skin and owned him!&quot;  Bwahaha.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Morningmist Avalanche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">People shouldn't badmouth this skill--it does help and is great for xp groups when groupmates probably are not fully buffed.  Cast on tank, tank begins to melee (my fave spot is HoH so high dmg output by mobs), a smack from this thing to the mob not only does damage......&lt;dramatic pause&gt; but increases aggro and aggro on tank----goood.<br />
<br />
Add the reasonably fast reuse time (4min) and you have a nice extra damage boost.  Admittedly not the best for raids (if I can't get this on the MT then I stick it on another warrior usually; it suits my guild well since we take less members to raids than most guilds do)  it is still a nice bit of burst damage, very nice for PoP mobs (high dmg output required)</div></div><hr />
