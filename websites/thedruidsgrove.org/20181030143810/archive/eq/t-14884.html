<br />
Are there one or two different emotes that result in an AE?   And what effect or how much damage does that AE hit for?  I can't remember since the raid leader had me up on the ledge and I avoided all that stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of: <br />
-a hazard begins to cast a spell. searing heat<br />
-a hazard begins to cast a spell. Scalding Steam<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance!</div></div><hr />

People get too caught up in those emotes and screw up Kyv emotes which are the main ones to watch for.</div></div><hr />

As for the kyv emotes, audio triggers are invaluable. Create a set and insist that everyone in the guild use it. Sure, you can win without them but the audio triggers took us from struggling with Foresight to winning it easily.<br />
<br />
Most people don't understand that every missed emote results in all emotes coming faster. Some people figure it's no big deal because they'll get a heal or heal themselves. Stress this point with your guild... If you miss an emote you are putting the win in jeopardy.</div></div><hr />
