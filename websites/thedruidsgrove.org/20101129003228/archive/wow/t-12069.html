You might find yourself wanted to wear some more cloth (even though it'll make you all the squishier).<br />
<br />
Main stats to look for at your level should be Int and Stam. Not too sure how relevant Spirit would be to you at your level but as you progress you'll want to start looking at +dmg gear around lvl 50 ++<br />
<br />
Good luck and happy moonkin'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xavale</div><div class="date">10-10-2007, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks for that.  i have one item to be held in the offhand which gives 1 intellect and 1 spirit, and which specifically states that its use is &quot;restores 50 mana every 3 seconds for 15 seconds&quot;.<br />
<br />
but i have another item also for the offhand, which has higher amounts (i think 3 intel and 3 spir).  but no specific use stated.<br />
<br />
will the second one restore any mana?  or does it help me with mana in some other way?  is one &quot;better&quot; than the other given my objective is to manage mana (i know that &quot;best&quot; and &quot;better&quot; questions are very subjective).   TY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">10-10-2007, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the stats do:<br />
<br />
- stamina: increases your total health by 10 per point of stamina<br />
- intellect: increases your total mana by 15 per point of intellect<br />
- spirit: increases your mana regeneration while not casting by 0.56 every 5 seconds (0 while casting, unless you have the talent Intensity, then it is 0.08 every 5 seconds while casting)<br />
<br />
Any stats on an item that begin with &quot;use: &quot; you have to click on the item in order to activate them.<br />
<br />
So the first one will regenerate 0.56 mana every 5 seconds (b/c of the 1 spirit), and on activation of it will regenerate 250 mana in total over 15 seconds.<br />
The second one will regenerate 1.68 mana every 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
I'd go with the second one because I usually forget about my &quot;use:&quot;-items and therefor something that needs no using works better for me. But by the numbers, if you really use the first offhand every time the cooldown is up, it is better.</div></div><hr />

Int/sta are what you need and also look into getting +dam later on.  Dreamweave is nice as it's only 3 pieces of cloth gear and has some int/spi on it as well.  It's tough until the outlands and then more druid caster gear is available.</div></div><hr />
