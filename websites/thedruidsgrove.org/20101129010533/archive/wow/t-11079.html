<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relicx</div><div class="date">09-19-2006, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Druid's Grove, I'm Relicx and I'm a starting graphic artist. I was looking for a fourm about druids and bam, woot, here I am. I was planning on making a druid but I needed to ask one question. How does a Druid deal max DPS?, whenever I see Druid pvp videos I always see bear form doing 200-300, and cat form kinda gets owned. <br />
<br />
     O well, besides the point, I'll make sigs for people if they want, it may take a day or two, I'm a busy guy. XD, All I ask for in return is some tips on how to make the best pvp druid. <br />
<br />
    If u want me to make u a sig then u may needa know that I don't render, so if you want something with a ss of your druid then you may need to go somewhere else, also, I suppose I can make a WoW themed sig, but I'm best with abstract and 3d renders, so I can make like a leafy green sig, but maybe not a druid casting Moonfire :(.<br />
<br />
Here is a small example of my work:<br />
http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/3251/greatojgundamsiguk0.jpg<br />
<br />
That is one of my really good pieces, so please, PM me or post here, and give me some good pwning builds!</div></div><hr />

Text on it saying Trixtaa     (Tauren Druid is optional)<br />
<br />
Ummm pvp you can go feral and most feral pvp use a 14/32/5 build. Basically gives you Omen of Clarity, a LOT of the feral talents and furor.<br />
<br />
Best to stay cat form and be a rogue ;) but remeber, you're a druid, you heal and can go bear and take a couple hits and cast spells too. It's about being versatile. Don't expect to win by staying in one form all day. Gearwise, load up on str and agi and with HotW you shouldn't be that gimped up in caster (mana pool for healing and shifting).<br />
<br />
-Trix</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">09-19-2006, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I am a 14/32/5 (Feral DPS) druid and love it.  What Trix says is so very true, for feral.<br />
<br />
The versatility of the feral druid is great.  My basic strategy if I am not already in combat is to prowl in cat and act just like a rogue finding vulnerable targets.  But if I can't find someone fading back from combat to rest (thats always fun) I'll go after anyone with a ravage or pounce.  Deal as much initial damage from omen of clarity procs in cat form then switch up to caster to drop a moonfire.  I then cast root and back off and switch to bear form.  Charge in and wear the oppontnt down.  If I need health I just frenzied regen.  You can also bash, go caster to root and back up for a heal.  This is where Trix was talking about shifting a lot.  What I just described is only one way to do it.  Depending on the situation you can prowl in and stay in cat form for great dps and never leave cat.<br />
<br />
If feral sounds fun to you, getting good dps is all just a matter of the talent build and practice with your timing and knowing what form is best for the situation.<br />
<br />
A balance druid is a caster that primarily uses wrath, moonfire, and starfire for dps.  GOing heavy in the balance tree gives reduced cooldowns, mana efficiencies, and increased critical chances.<br />
<br />
Again, druids are so versatile that it will just be a matter of what you enjoy doing.  For me, feral always looked so fun so I did it and have been having so much fun, but there are balance druids here at the grove that can go into great detail on their talent specs.<br />
<br />
Good luck and do whats fun.  DPS comes with experience and gathering the appropriate gear for the job.</div></div><hr />

Male NE Druid - Kyane<br />

From Feral &amp; clothie killer to resto and full time healer.<br />

Something with a metallic metal look to it.  DARK purple, not a light fruity shade =P<br />

Thanks in advance man!  You rock =D :texla:</div></div><hr />

BTW, I'm not putting any kinda of copyright to me or anythintg because I never liked having someone else's name on my sig, but if you could maybe put a little &quot;Thanks Relicx for the sig&quot; it would be much appericated.<br />
<br />
Ok big, metallic and dark purple, got it, I'll work on your tonight, got any tips for me on druids?<br />
<br />
Edit: Big, do u want Big9erfan or Kyane on it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kyane plz =D<br />
<br />
And if you can work a druid in there, be it in cat form or casting a spell with the Tier2 helm ;)  that would extra rock.  If not, that's cool too =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relicx</div><div class="date">09-19-2006, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, that will be tough, because, to get a chracter on to photoshop without the background, you have to render it, or crop out the bg, I can't do that rofl. So, if u can find a picture of a druid in a teir 2 helm on planet renders or something, as long as the file ends in.. like... .png, then I'll use that, otherwise, it won't look good</div></div><hr />

FYI - for the pict I supplied you, I used the WoW Model View ( downloadable from curse gaming ).  I set the background to some obnoxious color ( magenta always works ) and was able to take a screen shot and then remove the magenta in Photoshop.<br />

Just for your future sig making ideas =D</div></div><hr />

Works almost all of the time, even against 1-2 lvls above me (45 now). This keeps the target confused and doesn't allow them to sit in one strategy...I force them to think through the entire battle. Pally, Warrior and Rogues have 0 chance!!! This is an intense strategy but that is why I like the Druid...you will Never fall asleep at the keyboard if you play this toon correctly. Oh ya, I forgot I'm an engineer...sometimes when I feel like getting silly, I nuke 'em with my death ray, shrink them or mind control. Again, I try not to do 1 thing at a time, it catches them off guard and they spend the rest of the time trying to figure out an escape route!<br />
