Prathun and I talked about this, I asked for the spell to be indoor / outdoor like the Ranger spell.  His reply was to also make the ranger spell outdoor only.<br />
<br />
The spells are short duration on purpose, he wants the spells to be situational.<br />

I usually try to look for the positive with anything new and I am always willing to give something a try before I make a decision about it.  I have come to the conclusion that I will never use this spell again, as it is worthless as it stands now due to the outdoor restriction and the very short duration.  <br />

Prathun needs to review the situational spells the Druid class has.  There are too many of them, period.</div></div><hr />

QFT.  This affects druids the most, but it is starting to affect many classes more than is good.  They need to do a serious review of spell lines for each class before the next expansion, and discontinue many of them, or do a serious readjustment vs. mob HPs/dps/resists and player HPs/dps/resists.</div></div><hr />
