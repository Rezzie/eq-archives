<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fleckso</div><div class="date">03-21-2007, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a total noob druid (just hit 31), but I am sorta planning out my professions and stuff for when I hit high levels, so I was wondering if there's a spreadsheet or list of the best high level healing gear?  I know for my 70 rogue there are some spreadsheets out there with stat comparisons based on build that I find invaluable.  I mean, obviously there are gear procs that can't be reduced to numbers, and everyone's playstyle is different, but as someone completely new to this class, it would be nice if there was some kind of list of the type of gear out there.<br />
<br />
I'd hate to level my leatherworking to max, to find out that I wouldn't be using the crafted gear or something...</div></div><hr />

List with crafted Leather pieces with +1&gt; healing here (http://www.thottbot.com/?f=a&amp;name=&amp;skill=Leather&amp;source=8&amp;minrl=&amp;maxrl=&amp;minl=&amp;maxl=&amp;stat1=47&amp;c1=gt&amp;v1=1&amp;stat2=&amp;c2=gt&amp;v2=&amp;stat3=&amp;c3=gt&amp;v3=&amp;stat4=&amp;c4=gt&amp;v4=&amp;stat5=&amp;c5=gt&amp;v5=&amp;e=)<br />
<br />
As far as I know theres very few crafted LW gear for the resto druid. Would guess theres more in tailoring tbh. I wouldnt worry too much about healing leather equipment, you'll have 1st shot on pretty much all those drops, and at lvl 31-65ish I would go balance or feral.</div></div><hr />
