It seems like it stuns the mobs ok, but I seemed to stop attacking during that time as well.<br />
<br />
Like I stomp, and get the blue swirly things around the mobs to show they are stunned, but then I just stand there not attacking until it wears off, then autoattack resumed.<br />
<br />
Is that how it's supposed to work?<br />
<br />
I guess it would be a good escape ability - Stun, then run off, but I was hoping it was more of a way to handle a late add or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-12-2004, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the rogue stun works like that. More of a daze really. Once you successfully strike, your attack turns off. Very helpeful for rogues for they can then go around back of the NPC and backstab the bugger.<br />
<br />
I played around with some Taurens, but I didn't notice attack turning off. I'll have to pay closer attention next time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tykorandia</div><div class="date">11-30-2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trick to the war stomp is to understand it's limitations. Ironically, the &quot;War&quot; stomp seems best suited for running away.<br />
<br />
When you stomp, it stuns the surrounding enemies for 2s. If you are fighting with 2h Staves though, chances are you have a 3-4s strike time. So you stomp, they are stunned, then a second after they are stunned, you finally hit them. It really does make it feel like it is useless. However, if you drop to a single hand mace, with a .5-1s strike time, then you get 2 or 3 hits in. Or cast Moonfire, or, suppose you were surprised, it can give you bonus time to get your entangle on them. But overall, it seems best for when you are surrounded by mobs and you just need the extra time to get the heck out of there. <br />
<br />
I haven't tried the war stomp with any other class besides druid. I could see a dual-weilding warrior or rogue really being able to deal out some damage with it.<br />

You can buy a familiar.  I have a mechanical squirrel that follows my  bear butt around..</div></div><hr />

Plus I really like their long ears and cool mount :elfbiggri<br />
But I have to say.. undead are great as well. At first I thought they're too gloomy and somewhat of a cliche... until I rolled one :P</div></div><hr />

Tauren ROCK on horde side though. The reason I love both those races are that they are the tallest for their faction and since I'm 6'6&quot; its only natural that they are my favorite race /\./\<br />
and why is it that only 2 of the race's females look good. I mean unless one is into weird chicks or one is a chubby chaser...</div></div><hr />
