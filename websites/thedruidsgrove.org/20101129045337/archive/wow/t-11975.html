Multiple 70's decent gear, and watching friendships break up because of raiding conflict.  Wow for me had a good run, and is going to be a stepping stone for future games.

I wish i could play my druid in D2, without the temptation of buying all the best gear in game for like 2 dollars.  <br />

I agree end game isn't for everyone.  Raiding wasn't accessible to me at lvl 60, but when we got lvl 70, it became a reality for me.  Really I think it all comes down to who you play with and the guild you are in.  My guild is great and half of why I play is to bs in guild chat and laugh and make fun of one another.  Good people, good times.  <br />

Realistically.... if its not working for you now, take a break.  Cancel your account for a while.</div></div><hr />

I play every class, both horde and alliance. The only 2 characters I don't really enjoy are the shaman and paladin. Lack of ranged pulling steers me away from a pally.<br />

I enjoy the leveling and still haven't even touched PvP.</div></div><hr />

Until I had FFF on my Druid (now lvl 31), I hated dealing with closely spaced mobs.  Sure I could start as a caster and then shift into kitty but that was a PITA.  Now that I have FFF, I finally feel a bit more comfortable questing.<br />
<br />
My primary character is a lvl 70 hunter, so I've been sort of spoiled WGT pulling mobs.<br />
<br />
Back on subject, when I just had my hunter I was getting bored.  I don't do PvP and with so many DPS classes around it is often difficult to find a spot in 5-mans (not to mention the stigma all hunters have to deal with since many of us are complete morons).  So, I rolled a Druid.  This way I have an awesome DPS class (hunter) and tanking and/or healer class.  That should give me plenty to do.<br />
<br />
I moved my Druid from a PvP (Archimonde) server to a PvE (SWC) server where my hunter has been for some time.  A couple of my buddies on the PvP server decided to stop playing and I find the fear and annoyance of World PvP so over-whelming that I'm sure I'd quit.  Leveling on a PvE server is so calm and fun.  Take your time, sit in the middle of road when/where ever you want while you look-up quests, etc.  Heck sometimes the Alliance even helps out on quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pick up a different hobby or even another game? Do something you enjoy ;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">08-16-2007, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally agree with Trixtaa.<br />
<br />
You can walk away for a bit, level on some alts ( even another faction or server ) and perhaps find something totally new. <br />
<br />
Regardless, it does sound like you're a bit burnt and perhaps some time in that bright hot shining thing outside is what you need.  I hear it's called a &quot;sun&quot;, but that's just going off rumors I've heard. ;)</div></div><hr />

That is exactly why I stayed away from the lvl 70 end-game content.  I'm focusing on building my twinks right now, but I am interested in the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to correct you here, and I hope this doesn't cause you public embarrassment, but that bright hot shining thing is the god Apollo. Have you ever noticed how it goes from one end of the sky to the other? That's because he rides his golden chariot across the heavens every day to lord over the activities of his human subjects.<br />

A big blazing ball of burning hydrogen millions of miles away? Really? Come on, grow up and quit living in a fantasy world.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marrah</div><div class="date">09-28-2007, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed about having alts. My current druid (had a previous on on a pvp server and never could level) started out as an alt, but she's became my primary. I play a priest, pally, mage, or shammy as alts. I like exploring everything, too - even if not part of the &quot;druid&quot; or NE experience. Give WOW a break, then come back when you're ready...or roll something totally wacky.</div></div><hr />
