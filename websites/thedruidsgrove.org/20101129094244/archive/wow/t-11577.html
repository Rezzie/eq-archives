And I think what level you need to be depends on where you get it, I can only get +300 skinning when I hit 58 because the guy who trains it is in outlands, probably the same for alchemy, get lvling!</div></div><hr />

I got my rogue out there to get master alc.  I suggest you get portaled/summoned to shat, and set your harth there.  Then you mount up and make a run east for hellfire.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately the normal trainers aren't at shat... they're at honor hold (for alliance).  I suspect they're at Thrallamar for the horde.<br />
<br />
I made to the pass between takkar and hellfire without much trouble... then the ravagers ate my for breakfast.  I just spirit rez'd at Honor hold and took care of my buisness.  The road to the temple wasn't too bad, and once I got that FP and the zangermarsh FP, I was able to fly between the two.<br />
<br />
I actually enjoy being at shat... you can easily get to any major city via the portals... makes it convient.</div></div><hr />
