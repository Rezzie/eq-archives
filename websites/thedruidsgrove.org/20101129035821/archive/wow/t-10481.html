The public test realms (PTRs) are now live featuring the changes coming in patch 1.10.2, which you can read about in the patch notes. We have seen a profound benefit with offering major patches on the PTRs, and although this is a minor patch, we believe the benefits will apply to it as well. You can copy your character and help us test the upcoming changes by visiting the Public Test Realm Page. Character transfers to the test realm are available from 3:00 AM to 3:00 PM Pacific Time Monday through Friday, for accounts that were active as of 12:01 PM Pacific Time on Monday, April 17. The test realm game client, which can be downloaded at the same Public Test Realm Page, is available for both PC and Mac.<br />
<br />
Please be aware that the test realms are designed to allow us to test patches before they go public. Therefore, some changes may be introduced to the public test realms during the testing phase, before a patch goes live, and some changes may be introduced to the patch after the test realms have closed. To read more about the test realms, please review the Test Realm FAQ. We truly appreciate our players taking the time to help us test the latest changes to the game; thank you!</div></div><hr />
