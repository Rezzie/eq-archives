<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for a heirophants crook graphic or something similar that is a decent item for use. Doesn't have to a fabulous item, but I have always loved the old school staff look and still carry mine around just for that purpose. <br />
<br />
Of course, switching out gear all the time is somewhat annoying, and it would be nice to find something &quot;new&quot; that still had that old look and was more respectable at the higher levels.<br />
<br />
Any suggestion?<br />
<br />
Hey its not all about stats and functionality, some of this is supposed to be about fun! The Leprechaun needs his staff back!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My favorite is still the Greatstaff of Power.  It's unique and very appropriate for a druid!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very cool.<br />
<br />
Everyday its like a new treat after being gone so long! lol<br />
<br />
That will at least make things easier until I can find an adequate replacement, or maybe I wont. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

It's plain, its simple and I like it better than the epic graphics green gem thing.<br />
 <br />
It reminds me of some fun times with naggy back in the day.  One thing about that crook (I call it my boom stick hehe) I have crit aa almost maxed ..and with that new expansion melee shammy buff the crook hits for 1k damage at times .. which I think is not to shabby for a druid.  Especally for a old world boom stick.</div></div><hr />
