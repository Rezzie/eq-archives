 <br />
chaotic potential: im 1/5 for this so far<br />
DoT Crit: also 1/3 on the first level of this<br />
secondary forte: im 200 speci alteration right now, was thinking of using this to take evo to 100, but is it worth it before the afore mentioned?<br />
abundant healing: have shy'd away from this aa due to the rumors of it not working with GoM, which i have level 3 of.<br />
 <br />
heres my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1197615<br />

 <br />
it's one of those things you just have to take the dev's word for that it's actually doing something worthwhile.<br />
 <br />
if I had to pick from your list I'd go with crit affliction</div></div><hr />

In the end it's something that's nice to have b/c it's constant even if not very huge.</div></div><hr />

If you root/ rot much at all, the crit affliction will be great.  If you are primarily your groups healer then grab abundant healing.  Secondary forte will only help you with your nukes ... if you nuke a LOT then that could be the way to go.<br />
<br />
Something that you arent considering tho..I love avoiding damage and you still have lightning reflexes untouched.  If you ever get agro that wouldbe my first choice, it can really be a life saver.<br />

<br />
I would actually recommend maxing a lot of the AAs you have 1-2 points in and just finishing off Archtype AAs.  Archtype AAs are really good bang for the buck so to speak.  Defensive AAs would help you out as well.  That's just what I would do in your situation, so ignore that if you like =p<br />
<br />
Out of the AAs you're looking at you could probably benefit a bit by maxing chaotic potential, but as mentioned above if you solo root-rot a lot crit affliction would be the best bet for maximum return on your investment.</div></div><hr />
