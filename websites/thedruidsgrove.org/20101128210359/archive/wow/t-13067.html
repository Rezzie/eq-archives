<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">11-28-2008, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hoping to get some feedback from people in Naxx. currently my tank has 31.4k health unbuffed, 36.5% dodge, 25k armor. armor took a hit, i dropped my badge of tenacity for the badge dodge trinket. Currently i'm still working for my VH staff (sorry mr. armor), t7 chest and badge necklace. I'm thinking for geming and enchants I'm doing stamina first, agility second. I'm wondering if theres a point where I should stop increasing health, and focus on getting my agility up. (might be there now).  I've noticed my healers don't even bother flash healing me. They all use their greater healz, which can get a little scary when I get down to 5% health before they finally crit heal me for 17K (still only get to half health with that). The benefit though is with all that health, iLOTP healz me for like 1.3-1.5 every 6-7 seconds and when i activate frenzied regeneration, that basically makes me unkillable for the duration, and those two abilities will only get better with more health. On a side note, I love on aoe bosses, if my healer goes down i can keep fighting and it takes the boss another minute to kill me without any heals. Makes me feel tough.</div></div><hr />
