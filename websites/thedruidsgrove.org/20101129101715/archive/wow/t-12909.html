The other Resto druid in our Guild uses it and he absolutely loves it.  <br />

Of course, I understand druid healing is changing radically as of today, and stacking 3 LB's on multiple targets is no longer the healing strategy of choice for druids...<br />
<br />
I am a Healbot fan.  The setup is so easy compared to the modular nightmare that Grid seems to me to be.<br />
<br />
Going to have to do a couple levels resto to relearn how to heal...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely.  Lifebloom FTW!<br />
<br />
I think Nourish will be rather nice for light fights or general raid (party) healing.  <br />
<br />
And, I'm sure it will do nicely as a &quot;holy crap!&quot; healing option.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Also, they improved Regrowth quite a bit, and apparently with the new glyphs Regrowth is a very desirable part of a raid healer's arsenal now.<br />
<br />
I'm just reporting what I've read that beta players posted.  I have yet to try it myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which makes the change to casting lesser heals somewhat perplexing then.  I'm going to reserve QQ'ing until I've run a few instances and got my head around the changes.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure that a tree should be able to cast and keep up a lifebloom stack indefinitely on a tank which was more than possible in Kara gear pre patch but I do think that if they've made it too easy for healer to go OOM and too hard for them to replenish via pots etc then it will mainly be the casual groups that will suffer as a result.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, I did run my sPriest thru Kara last night, and although her Spell Crit rate was off the hook, her mana took a huge beating during even the simplest of fights.<br />
<br />
On the upside, running Kara is about as difficult as Scarlet Monastary now, so if you have some guildies who enjoy having Kara on Badge Farm, I recommend sneaking your higher leveled alts in there for some unattested gear drops before the release.  My priest hit 70 a week and a half ago and she got her T4 Helm from Mr. Malchezaar last night.  /giddy<br />
<br />
OK - now onto Druid stuff.<br />
<br />
Prior to this patch, I lived, loved, trained &amp; PAID FOR every spell known to Druidkind.  Last night, as instructed, I promptly went to my Druid Trainer and had to RE-TRAIN FOR and REPAY FOR the same spells I've known and used for 2 years.<br />
<br />
And, why oh why, am I unable to train for Insect Swarm (Rank3) Level 30 Requirement?  Along with many, many others?</div></div><hr />

After one patch in BC where they made spirit more worthwhile, mana was basically coming out our ears, you had to be awful to run out. <br />
<br />
It'll be fun to have a little challenge back when it comes to managing the blue-stuff.<br />
<br />
Back to the original question, so Healbot still doesn't show the lifebloom stack?  Anyone confirm that?<br />
<br />
(I love Grid too, but I hate configuring it)</div></div><hr />

Excellent!  I think I'll give it another try.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My burden is that when a DPS take some splash damage, the other healers in the raid will HoT up the same targets I do, thus we end up waisting a good chunk of mana and GCD's.  <br />
<br />
I have found that the Glyph of Healing Touch helps with as it gives druids a flash heal, but we pay a significant price by losing our &quot;big heal&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heal-Bot i dont know.<br />
<br />
Pitbull-Unitframes Shows all the HoTs of Druids on the Frames.<br />
And i think u can configure it, to see also Priest-Hots (not sure of that, never tried it)</div></div><hr />
