<br />
I spent a lot of time at Gargoyle City, and here's how I was able to work it out...<br />
<br />
When you zone into PoN, go west to the zone wall, and then go north along the wall as high up as you can (remember invis and SoE).  When you hit the NW corner of the zone, turn east, and keep up along the wall til you approach the rift that runs along the center of the zone.  Don't get TOO close, or you'll agro the mobs from the rift.<br />
<br />
Now head south along the edge of the plateau, and after a few hundred yards, turn east and float over the chasm.  You'll be able to see an area where you can get back up to the far plateau, even if you drift down a bit.  Once across, head NE towards the corner of the zone (near the hedge).  Cut in front of the hedge, and then south along the east wall of the zone.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the east wall is the zone-in for PoNb, so you'll need to come away from the wall a bit as you move past it.  Once past, back to the wall.  When the hills start bending to the west, you just need to get around that last hill, and there you are, in front of the Gargoyle city.<br />
<br />
To the east and west side are areas with no wanderers that you can use to kite or root/rot.<br />
<br />
This is a decent are through 62.  Once 63, hit PoStorms for the frogs.  At 65 you can hit the basements in HoH.  Those are good til 67.  After that, I have no idea, that's as far as I ever got!<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
