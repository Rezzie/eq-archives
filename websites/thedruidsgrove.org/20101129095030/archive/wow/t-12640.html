<br />
I am a PvE restoration druid and I have a question regarding Drums of Battle, I hope you can help me.<br />
<br />
I have one of these in my bag but I always forget to use them during raid encounters. The thing is, I have noticed that when I do use the damn thing (normally during boss fights when the raid leader says &quot;Go full out on DPS, use all trinkets&quot;) I tend to die within a few seconds of clicking it!<br />
<br />
I don't think i am high on Omen but it just seams to occur quite regularly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe if you can give us some more details, such as which boss encounter, what phase/percentage, etc, we can help some more? :&gt;<br />

I notice it when triggering my &quot;uber DPS&quot; macro on the hunter. Trigger macro, get stunned for the duration. Trigger macro, have to move. Trigger Macro, something else goes wrong and I get squished etc etc.<br />
<br />
I'm going to rename it &quot;macro of Doom&quot;.</div></div><hr />
