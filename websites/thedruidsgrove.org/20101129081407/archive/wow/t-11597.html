<br />
I am an enchanter and alchemist, and neither of the sides had anything that was appealing to my professions (seemed to be all craftable gear recipies).  Both have some appealing shoulder enchants.  Aldor has a better ring, while scryer has a healing staff and nice pants.<br />
<br />
What is the consensus is best for a druid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
on a more serious tone, Scryer has as you mentioned a healing staff and the only alchemy recipe between the two so I went with Scryer.</div></div><hr />

Overall I like the shoulder enchants for Aldor.<br />
<br />
Generally anything you can buy from them other than the enchants you upgrade pretty fast you are instancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took Aldor cause i liked the exalted tanking shoulder enchant better.<br />
<br />
In hindsight i would choose scryer next time.  Its hard to find good +def gear.  For two holy dust/arcane rune i would rather have +13 def than +13 dodge.<br />
<br />
For 8 holy dust/arcane runes  i still prefer the aldor 15 dodge/10 defense to the scryer 10 dodge/15 defense.<br />
<br />
Burning 8 tokens  every time you get a new pair of shoulders sucks though.  The +13 def  2 token scryer  inscription is a better stopgap than the +13 dodge  2 token aldor one.<br />
<br />
I don't really care about any of the other purchaseable items.  Almost all of them can be bettered by a few instance runs at level 70.</div></div><hr />

With Earthwarden, Helm and Shoulders from Arena with good +def gems all you need is a little bit more resil/defense (ring/neck) and you are crit immune.<br />
<br />
This is from the forums.<br />
<br />
Leaves you able to still use high armor/stamina pieces in the other slots since we already will be using Earthwarden anyways for tanking.  Crit immunity for 2 slots seems very good.  The rings are nice too with +defense from Hillsbrad CoT.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena Head and Shoulders:<br />
<br />
Head: http://www.thottbot.com/?i=54970<br />
Shoulders: http://www.thottbot.com/?i=54971<br />
<br />
Crit immunity. Yeah, it's within our grasp now. But strictly through PvE content, our option to get to it, well, stinks (Heavy Clefthoof Set, high stam, high +defense, and NOTHING else).<br />
<br />
However, if we venture into the realm of PvP we can become crit immune with 2 pieces of gear. How? Well, we need 154 +defense to become crit-immune (this assuming you already have -3% to be critted via talents, which you damn well better!). Each point of Resilience is the equivalent of 1.5 +defense for the purposes of reducing crit chance by mobs. So, lets do some simple math:<br />
<br />
20 res: Head<br />
15 res: Shoulders<br />
35 res: 2-piece set bonus<br />
5 res: Socket Bonuses<br />
12 def: defense gems in the yellow sockets<br />
24 def: Earthwarden (assumed you'll get this from CE rep)<br />
<br />
For a total of 75 resilience and 36 +defense. Convert the resilience over with that 1:1.5 conversion, and we get the equivalent of 148.5 defense. Make up the remaining 5.5 with another yellow gem socket, a vindicator's armor kit, or your favorite tanking necklace, and you're golden.</div></div><hr />

I like the dodge shoulder enchant more (I figured I would at the time, although I didn't realize the whole def situation at the time, but luckily it wasn't hard to get uncrittable).  I love 2 of the rewards I got for Aldor quests too, the kitty shoulders and the ring.  I hope we'll need FR soon, cause I got those patterns to make as well.  &gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />
