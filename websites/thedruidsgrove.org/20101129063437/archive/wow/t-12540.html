<br />
I am a 65 44/0/13 balance spec druid on a PvP server.  I don't love PvP but this is where my brother and my friends play, so there it is.<br />
<br />
I solo alot, and like most non-uber toons get ganked by stealthed rogues and kitty druids fairly regularly.  Assuming I can recover from the stun and respond before they kill me, what is the best spell sequence?  I've been most successful experimenting with Barkskin, then Force of Nature, then Regrowth, but that stupid target circle for the trees slows me way down.<br />
<br />
I know there must be a better way.  Please help!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Make sure to faerie fire the rogues so they can't vanish, though if they CoS I'd pop bear and wait for them to show up again, bash and reroot and start cannoning them.  <br />
<br />
As long as you have some DoTs on them it'll make stealthing hard so keep those up.  Worse comes to worse, root and run away, though other druids are harder to get away from than rogues.  But seriously, HoT as soon as possible, especially if they've gotten the jump on you and abolish poison for rogues.  <br />
<br />
Other druids will be much harder to kite without cyclone, but the treants should help a lot along with whatever spells you can shoot off.  And to be honest, once a feral is OOM they're pretty much toast if they can't heal/shift in and out of traps.  I should know, I'm feral and once I go OOM I'm pretty much toast especially if I lose track and get stuck in caster.</div></div><hr />

A fight you can't win. Are these truly &quot;ganking's&quot; or just PvP events where you have a decent chance? Because the tone changes considerably.<br />
<br />
You should use all of your Druidness to escape a ganking. But ganking by definition is hard to escape. If any class can do it it's a druid! There's a rogue on the WoW druid forums who was complaining abotu &quot;Cowardly&quot; druids running away.<br />
<br />
So remember, escaping from a ganker is a victory! They're frustrated and you're alive. :devil-lau</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">04-17-2008, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So true though. <br />
<br />
I was in Eastern Plaguelands with my mage friend around level 56-58 and this 70 rogue pops up and one-shots her and turns to me.  I switched to bear, bashed him, popped cat form and dashed off, then stealthed the second I was out of combat and snuck off to an obscure area.  <br />
<br />
I watched him run around with track humanoid for a good 10 minutes looking for me while I snickered to myself in the corner.  He was human and popped perception even but I made sure to keep my distance.  <br />
<br />
It's a small victory but still feels good to be able to get away and at least frustrate them because we are awesome as druids. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">04-18-2008, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I define ganking as an unprovoked sneak attack.  It usually happens to me when I am in the middle of fighting something else, or else reading my quest log.:/<br />
<br />
With rogues I'm usually dead or nearly so before I can even move.  Druids usually hit me with Pounce when I'm in the middle of fighting something else, so the result is the same.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for something I can do on those rare occasions that I do have time to respond.  I have to admit, running away never occurred to me, although I can see how that would be preferable to dying.  Definitely not preferable to winning the fight though...<br />

Hit him with bug swarm, trees, starfire, wraith, moonfire. Then get ready in for him to be in your face. Kite with cheetah and or dash and get him locked up again with roots, rinse and repeat. Hope that helps. use your HOTS!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-18-2008, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a (decently geared) rogue or druid jumps you while fighting mobs, you have a low survival rate.  Thats the idea of ganking.  Frustrating as hell.  But the good news is that you can do it yourself.  Revenge is sweet, or so they say.  <br />
<br />
If you pop NG while fighting mobs, there is a good chance that one of the mobs will get rooted.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do against a rogue is to immediatley cast abolish poison on urself (so you get rid of that bastard crippling poison and get away), hot up, get to bear right away, hit a bash (hope to hell it lands, which it never does), then cheeta the hell out of there and get to stealthcat as soon as you drop combat.  <br />
<br />
For druids, if you even get a chance, pop barkskin and hibernate, then get out of combat, heal up, innervate, get back into stealthcat and go tear them a new one.<br />
<br />
WoW PvP has always been, except in certain rock v paper type class matchups, whoever gets the jump usually wins the fight (edit: again, assuming skill level and gear level are equal... Dungeon Blues Druid v T6 anything = lose).</div></div><hr />
