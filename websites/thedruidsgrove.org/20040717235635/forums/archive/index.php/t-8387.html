Poll (http://forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=8248). So far, a large majority of 38 out of 42 (90.5%) says classes are not balanced. The remaining 9.5% says classes are balanced. <br />
<br />
Based on the results, this poll will focus on what mechanisms the community believes will will bring about balanced priest classes. Obviously there are many ideas floating around at the moment so I can't possibly list every idea. What I will do instead is to group similiar ideas together and do a more detailed drill-down poll a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
Personal plea: Try to vote for what you think is best for Everquest overall, rather than vote for what is best for yourself or your class. So please take into consideration grouping and raiding issues before you vote.</div></div><hr />

I voted for 3 equal also. but I figured it could be accomplished by using a combination of that and <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Close the healing gap between priest classes to somewhere around the 100%:80%:60% ratio. Clerics will be compensated, possibly with proportionately better dps<br />
we all heal equally but not by having 100% equal heals. does that mean we still agreed on something other then Trak--or does my factoring in other things null and void that?<br />
 <br />
i will tell you this. I dont think many other clerics will be voting for<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Rebalance priests to achieve 3 equally viable main-healer classes. Upgrade healing for hybrids to fill secondary healer role.<br />
because it is missing the VERY vital line<br />
 <br />
 <br />

i assumed that line was meant to be in there, otherwise my vote is definitly<br />

may want to fix that Iilane.  because some of us that voted it was unbalanced realized that GOD was unbalanced one way while soloing was unbalanced the other.  and we also know that just putting in totally equal healing without changes to seriously upgrade clerics dps would totally unbalance exp grind groups.   I hope you meant to include about balancing clerics to be equally viable dps/utility outside of healing when you suggested <br />

otherwise it kind of justifies our worst fears</div></div><hr />
