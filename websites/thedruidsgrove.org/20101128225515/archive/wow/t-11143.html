<br />
Does anyone know if +stam bonus from items like Chimera Chops and Rumsey Rum are affected by the HoTW bonus or is it generated from your base stats?<br />
<br />
Is it (Base Stam * 120%) + 25 stam + 15 stam or<br />
(Base Stam + 25 stam + 15 stam) * 120%?<br />
<br />
I know that Dire Bear form doesn't take advantage of enchants, but I wasen't sure about consumables.</div></div><hr />

I figured  every  point of stamina you had got a 20% bonus.  The tooltip doesn't say 'base stamina' or 'stamina from items'.  This wouldn't be the first confusing tooltip though =]<br />
<br />
It should be pretty easy to determine though.  In non-bear form, take note of your stamina.  In bear form take note of your stamina (should be 1.2*).  Drink your booze.  Your stamina should be +15 (or whatever) more.  Go into bear form and see if your stamina is +15 from the previous number, or +18.<br />
<br />
This is of course if you're still able to do basic math after drinking such strong booze =]<br />
<br />
I'll check it out tonight.  I've got some the the green grog from DM Trib I can drink.<br />
<br />
Are all buffs considered equal?  What about a PW:F?  MotW?  Well-fed buffs?  Do these come before or after our HotW multiplier.</div></div><hr />

I don't recall any mention of consumables though.</div></div><hr />
