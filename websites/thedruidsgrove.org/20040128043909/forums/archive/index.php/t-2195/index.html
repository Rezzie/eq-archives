If I remember right, killing bandits in WK helps repair several of the factions in the Qeynos/Surefall area - can't remember which ones exactly though.</div></div><hr />

The Holly Windstalker faction (first one listed there) is tied to five different events, any one of which could reduce that faction:<br />
<br />
Participated with any battle in the Plane of Growth <br />
Killed the Millers in Qeynos Hills <br />
Killed Holly Windstalker in Qeynos Hills <br />
Killed Druids at a druid circle <br />
Killed Treants</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqalfie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I killed the millers a lot in my 30's getting &quot;lazy experience&quot; the only problem I had upon starting my epic was with Alrik who is on The Keepers Of The Arts faction, he wouldn't talk to me, neither would the batwing chick ( forgot her name ) so I couldnt fix with batwing quest. Wolf form wouldn't work either. <br />
<br />
I could have killed Kizdean Gix over and over but at 15 min spawn time it would have taken forever. I did the Jeremys letter quest in jagged pine went from dubious to amiable in an hour.<br />
<br />
AS someone said though, who will not talk to you?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Guanoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK...i was under the assumption that my faction was already jacked because of killin millers. It is not..iv had no problems with the quest so far cept for alrik...did batwing quest and got to amiable so all is good so far no probs. Killed the corrupter in EK last nite all druids were amiable. Read a walkthru that someone linked me and it said killen Millers wont hurt doin epic in any way, but would just make it slightly more difficult cause of the kos to Qeynos guards. All is good now. Thanks for the replys.<br />
