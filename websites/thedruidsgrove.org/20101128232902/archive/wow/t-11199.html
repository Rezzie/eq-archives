Aggro maintaince abilities are 99.99% PvE.  The only aggro ability which can be used in PvP is growl and against hunter's pets.  If you can grab aggro for 2s from a clothy (I didn't say it was THAT useful see .01% =)</div></div><hr />

It is also my understanding its range is very short and only effects the targetted mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my first thought as well, but when I was farming the twilight guys in Silithus, I would prowl up behind them, hit cower when close enough (and it is very short range, indeed) thinking that they'd be less likely to turn and attack me before I could Pounce.  However, as soon as I hit Cower, they'd start attacking me :/</div></div><hr />

I belive that cower lowers the aggro(or rather -threat generated) while rogues feint kills all aggro (threat generated), but its the only threat reducing ability we have :)<br />

well put.<br />

To answer your question, cower is only used in PvE content in a raid/group, theres no need for it when you out there soloing and questing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A warrior and I were riding through Silithus, when we came across a 60 horde druid.  I stealthed immediatley, and the warrior charged.  The druid actually Cowered before the warrior!  <br />
<br />
I just thought that was funny... either the druid had a sense of humor (unlikely) or he was an ubernoob and thought that Cower would do anything against said warrior.  <br />
<br />
If you don't have it, and are raiding, download KTM Threat Meter.  KTM is a HUGE help, and you can tell exactly when to use cower so as not to jump to the top of the aggro list.  <br />
<br />
And yeah, Cower is a single target threat reduction, as opposed to a Priests Fade, which is an AoE, or multi-target threat reduction.  <br />
<br />
Someone here once called Cower a 'ghetto-fade'.  Funny.  Healing aggro?!  &quot;**** Catform Cower quick! &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flix</div><div class="date">10-23-2006, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Btw as someone stated above, yes, in a patch or two ago all druids in cat form now generate 20% less threat from everything they do whilst in cat form. It's a passive thing, and affects kitties of all levels and specs. Or so the patch notes claimed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zack</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's definitely a lot easier to dps in raids after the threat reduction we got, yeah. ...and it's 29%, not 20% (rogues also got upped to 29% when we got ours, but warriors are still at 20% unless they're in def stance.<br />
<br />
There's a pretty big difference between priest fade and cat cower though -- fade is only temporary, while cower is permanent. If you cower, you reduce your threat towards that target until it's dead or the fight is over. If you fade, you only reduce it for the duration of the fade spell (unless combat ends first, ofc).<br />
<br />
Currently, going cat and cowering isn't very useful if you get healing aggro. It's expensive (especially if you haven't got natural shapeshifter), and you only reduce your threat by 426 (should be 600, but the feint effect also gets the -29% modifier :-/ ), which is the same as healing 852 hp (a bit more if you've got subtlety). If a cower gets the mob off you, you'll probably have it back with the next heal, unless a tank grabs it properly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-24-2006, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it is not an attack, it cannot miss, be blocked, dodged or parried.

yes, it can</div></div><hr />

Your Cower is parried by Ebonroc.<br />

Some friends of mine tell me it can be blocked as well, but not resisted.</div></div><hr />

I would Prowl up on the Jade Oozes and hit Cower.  The first thing Cower does is put you in combat with your target.  Then you break stealth, etc.  <br />
<br />
I wish the tool tip was more clear here - I definately got the impression that Cower was a bit more like Soothe Animal...oh well.</div></div><hr />
