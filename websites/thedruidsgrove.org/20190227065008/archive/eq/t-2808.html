<br />
I can maybe root the mezzed things, maybe root a pet after charm break, but I am trying to figure out why this one is so much better than engorging roots.  Does anyone use this regularly?  Give me some insight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geddine</div><div class="date">01-02-2003, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only had this spell memmed 2 times, once to see what difference it made (none) and another to see how it would work on another type (high root breaking) mob (no change), after a couple of hours it was plain these spells (Eathern and Savage) have nothing to offer over Engorgin except a waste of a parchment handin and a spellbook scribe spot.<br />
<br />
This spell works just as effectively as Engorging Roots (in some places alot worse).<br />
<br />
Thats not the worst of it we also had a high level spell wasted on an upgrade which seems no different except the casting cost is back to normal but the casting time is all screwed up.  So now we have a choice of a short casting time, vendor purchasable, low mana cost root with a DD built in &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; you can go for the high mana cost, fast casting &quot;questable&quot; plain jane root spell &lt;strong&gt;OR&lt;/strong&gt; the low mana costing, slow casting &quot;rare questable&quot; plain jane root spell.<br />
<br />
Who ever tells you that being no DD and having a resist adjust on the spell means less resists obviously hasn't used this spell much.  I admit the resists maybe the slightest bit better, something like 1 extra stick out of 100 casts.  I'll take my damage roots everytime THANK YOU.<br />

<br />
Engorging Roots resisted all the time for me while fighting things in halls of honor.  <br />
<br />
Earthen Roots would stick way more often.  It is also infinitely more useful for crowd control on summoning mobs, as you won't do any damage...so no summon.<br />
<br />
I don't mem Earthen anymore though.  Because Savage Roots is a step above it.  Has the same low resist rate do to lure and a lower mana cost then earthen.<br />
<br />
Engorging and Earthen are both in the back of my spell book now.  Savage is all I use.</div></div><hr />

I have noticed the resists are much less than with standard roots, but the biggest advantage is the lack of damage. It is great to park summoners for a while without any risk of being summoned.</div></div><hr />

Golems in PoV, HoH stuff, anything in a teir 2+ zone basically.<br />
 <br />
  Earthen Roots is much faster casting than Savage Roots, so I use it when I have to land a root quickly like when backing up an enchanter for CC.  Savage Roots lasts a long time so I use that when I have to park things but time isn't as critical.<br />
 <br />
  I keep both new roots, engorging, grasping and entrapping at the front of my spellbook although I pretty much only use savage or earthen anymore, entrapping doesn't land enough to bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Savage Roots &gt; Engorging Roots &gt; Earthen Roots<br />
<br />
Earthen Roots is guaranteed to break after a minute.  I'd rather use the damaging root spell and have a chance at a 3 minute root.  Still better, Savage Roots can (and does) hold things in place for over 4 minutes.  The resist modifier is noticeable, IMO.<br />
<br />
As Lotusfly once put it, &quot;Earthen Roots is a Ranger spell given to Druids as a courtesy.&quot;  I could imagine memorizing it in the Hedge Maze, Cazic Thule or other high mob density areas, but other than that I think you'd be better served keeping Engorging Roots memorized.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  Then Lotusfly is wrong.  PoP hybrid spells are all overpowered bringing hybrids closer than ever to casters for spell casting power (while keeping up if not leading meleers in that department too) and rangers should never have gotten anything remotely like earthen roots.  When you have a mob that hits for over 500 on you or the enchanter the difference between savage roots and earthen roots is a dead caster.  We don't have Divine Aura, we don't have Bestow Divine Aura, we have a 1.8 second cast root instead that is identical to what every one else gets except @#%$ SOE decided to make ours fizzle more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Engorging roots is all but useless in tier 2+ zones. It simply gets resisted nearly every cast. I only have earthen roots so far but I would rather have that lasting 1 minute on the mob nearly every time, than have a damage root get resisted 5 or even 10 times in a row and then break in seconds.<br />
<br />
I have been duoing with a fellow druid who has Savage roots and its ability to stick for long periods on high level mobs is quite remarkable. I hope I get it soon!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broomhilda</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Engorging Roots still when i'm killing stuff thats not hard to land spells on.  Mostly alot of PoN type of stuff, but then again the only times i'm there is when i'm solo charming, and the damage on it helps get exp.  Engorging Roots lasts longer than Earthen Roots most of the time.<br />
<br />
That said, Earthen Root is the only root i use in PoV-PoS.  You'll get resisted 3/4's of the time trying to root them with Engorging.  Thats what i tried using my first times out there but it was a waste of mana.  Plus, it tends to stick pretty well, i played CC with no Enchanter in Inner Razorfiend Caves using Earthen.  These are mobs that were con'ing white and yellow to me, and there is no way Engorging would've stuck, not to mention it would've caused me to kept getting summoned.  Use it all the time in PoS groups too for CC.  <br />
<br />
So imo both are situational in which is best.  I'm sure Earthen will go to the back of the spellbook once i get Savage, but i also heard the cast time on that is longer so not sure about that either.  Very happy to have these root spells though, couldnt imagine POP without'em.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet one costs twice as much and the other one takes longer to cast, and yet these spells are less then lower version (meaning no damage component just a root).  So we are paying more to get less, just doesn't make sense in an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  No damage is good, it means you don't break mez or trigger summoning.  Really, whats 200 damage on a 24k+ hp mob anyway?<br />
 <br />
  Unfortunatly Savage Root's casting time and high level mean it's hard to channel or get off in a timely fashion makeing it far less of a spell than it could have been.</div></div><hr />

Eh, OK. Regardless of the courtesy factor, it was totally necessary to have this new root type since during beta rooting with the old roots was unreliable, virtually nonfunctional, frustrating for all rooting classes, and ultimately lame. And it was made clear that we all needed new roots to handle these higher-level mobs. I fussed quite a bit about how lame engorging roots had become.</div></div><hr />

The difference of 30 in the resist factors will astound you. Even though earthen has a shorter duration than engorging, you will think it is the other way around.<br />
<br />
If I had skipped tier 1 planes (well, and kunark, velius, luclin) and went straight to teir 2+, I would seriously believe that engorging roots only had a max duration of 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I dont have much trouble with it.  I have earthen, tried it, didnt like it.  I dont know if it has changed any since I got it, but it sucked for me.  Only good use I found was on mobs that have so little hps that a 205 root puts them into mid 96% to start summoning me, or to pl a n00b char.<br />
If this is a better root for pvp however, I didnt know that and will make adjustments accordingly =)<br />
