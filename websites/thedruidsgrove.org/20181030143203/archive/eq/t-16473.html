I don't think Preincarnation has fired a single time yet.  Spell seems broken.</div></div><hr />

I know I didnt see Second Life Rank 1 go off that much but it did increase on Rank 2 and yes I do realise there is the same percentage chance of each rank of both spells I am just saying what I experienced when Second Life was first out</div></div><hr />

Never got Rk. 1.    Worked on the Faction to get Rank 2.    <br />

As for others getting second life after I died, no idea.</div></div><hr />

Prior to that i have had this spell rk 1 for a couple months and still no proc.  Not sure if this is a new bug but to notice second life procing all the time and never see this one proc once? Sounds like a bug to me.  Anyone else recently noted anything?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As far as it procing on the group .. every other time i died it proced on them .. <br />
 <br />
some advice if you do use this spell let the group know you got it on, if you die and it procs . they won't be able to hit or cast spells , which is ok if your group was just ready to wipe (it's saved my group a few time from bad pulls and near wipes)<br />
but if the group is doing good and didn't need the proc let them know they can click it off to keep fighting and casting ( it freaks them out cause most think the mob cast some type of spell on them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">03-26-2009, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The group recourse does not instantly cause the rest of your group to suddenly become invulnerable.  The recourse hits the rest of the group with a buff which is similar to a short-duration Preincarnation.<br />
<br />
If a group member should then die while they have the recourse buff active, then they may also be saved by invulnerability.</div></div><hr />
