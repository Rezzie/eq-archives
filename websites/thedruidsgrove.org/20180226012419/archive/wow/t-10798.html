I know that not all Druids that PvP are full Feral....just kinda curious if any of you Resto Druids love to PvP.  What build have you found that works best for you?<br />
<br />
I am currently working on my 60 build (getting there....wahoo!) and when I have narrowed mine down I will post them.  Just gotta do a little tweaking.  It's just taking me a little while because I am trying to find the perfect mix for what my goals are.<br />
<br />
Post away with those wonderful Healing PvP specs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakiniku</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My old spec was one of my favorites.  8/11/32<br />
<br />
8 points in Balance for Nature's Grasp and Natural Shapeshifter.  11 pts feral to get feral charge and imp. bash.  <br />
<br />
Powerful healer while still maintaining survivability in PvP.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind my current spec as I'm called upon to off-tank once in a while (helps being feral).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cobra13e</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't PvP much, spec'd 5/11/35.<br />
Yakiniku is right about Feral Charge,  Natural Shapeshifter for BG's (WSG particularly) - not that important for &quot;World PvP&quot; (which is dead IMO)............</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea.  I love Feral.  That is my favorite PvP spec, but after having withdraw from being a Priest (my level 60 Priest is retired) I for some reason miss doing the healing.  <br />
<br />
I have a friend who has a level 60 Druid (along with a 60 Rogue and 60 Mage).  He is a 0/0/51 build and is apparently almost impossible to kill in PvP/duels.  Although survivability is very nice and very important....I love Nature's Grasp too much to let that go.  It's nice to make an enemy mad when they think they have you and then they are mysteriously rooted.  I've got about 3 or 4 builds I'm considering....all include Nature's Grasp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok....here are my possible builds along with explanations.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MzLZxxMcZEE0oeo0o<br />
- I love cat form and find that it is the form I do best with when it comes to PvP (if I am in a form)<br />
- Furor to help make my Feral forms a lil quicker in attack<br />
- Insect Swarm....another attack is always helpful and with decreasing their chance to hit helps even more<br />
- Swiftmend is a great PvP talent point (and can be a great PvE talent point too)<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MzL0hZZEEcqcqV<br />
- With Natural Shapeshifter and Reflection....helps with making sure I can conserve mana for much needed shifting or healing<br />
- Furor...well it's always helpful<br />
- Helps my healing so that I can be more efficient and useful in raids<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MzLZZEE0qeqVo<br />
- I love Nature's Grasp<br />
- Allows for the great heals for raiding and PvP...and still gives some of the good Resto attacks<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=MzLZxxMccbZVE0Vxo<br />
- Boosts my Feral abilities for PvP<br />
- Helps with making my important heals faster and more mana efficient<br />
<br />
I know some of you may not agree with these builds....but these go well with my playstyle.  They are just some that I am considering.  Like I said, I want to PvP and raid....and I want to help my healing.  The last one is geared a little more towards PvP....but of course gear can help with the healing.  That is the one thing about this build....I haven't factored in my gear because it will be different when I get 60.  I am hoping to carry 2 sets of gear with me at all times to make me more versatile in raids and PvP.</div></div><hr />

This is my fav' Resto BG build... not counting the pre-druid-patch 9/11/31.  I'm on a PvE server, so world pvp isn't a concern... and I'm assuming that's where Cat really shines.  I started grining with the 9/11/31 moved to more or less the above build, then finished Rank 10 with a variation of the above without Imp. Reg and with Imp MoTW for raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea.  I'm on a PvP server, so world PvP can be an issue as well.  I truly enjoy PvP, whether it is world PvP or just BGs.  The verdict is still out as to what I am going to try first.  I haven't really respec'ed yet, so I have a lil gold to play with.<br />
<br />
I've not done much else besides WSG for PvP yet, but I really want to play with AV.  I've done a lil bit of AB.  <br />
<br />
Any Resto Druids got any good tactics for AV?  I would love to hear what you have to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AV is all about range.  Stick with your group you are healing and back from the fighting and you will do great.<br />
<br />
Don't miss out on the fun of dropping some nukes though.  My personal favorite is when the hordies clump up on the flag defending a graveyard and then our melee rushes in.  There is so much going on they don't even notice I have 8-10 of them in my hurricane.<br />
<br />
Terrain can be huge factor as well.  While the melee forces are advancing more or less along the road you can be climbing adjacent hills, etc and dropping heals while staying out of most players field of vision so you don't get targeted.<br />
<br />
AV is my favorite thing to do with my moonkin right now, I just wish I could get in more nights (3-4 hour wait on my server).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.  Thanks!  I can't wait to get in there.  That might help me decide on the right build for me then!  Woo hoo!  I can't wait to hit 60!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I had the most fun grinding rep for AV. I actually spec'd Moonkin to grind the rep because of the easy, long ranged starfires and hurricanes to rack up that rep. <br />
<br />
I remember the one time I had a group of 4 or 5 intelligent players that were sticking around me because I was healing them.....the 6 of us wore down wave after wave of Alliance on the field of strife trying to retake the Snowfall GY. Most fun Ive ever had in a BG, bar none.</div></div><hr />

I never really thought about this build. What would be the pros/cons of this build if you are a raiding healer? Is there a better build for a raiding healer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">07-27-2006, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 0/0/51 Build has seven worthless points for PvP, namely the reduced threat talents for regular heals and tranquility.  Those are 7 points that could be put elsewhere.  IMO, Feral Charge is a REALLY nice PvP talent.  Also, in PvP Reflection probably isn't going to be makign that much of a difference, cause fights are usually really quick, and you have time to sit and drink, or die.  Only exception being AV, but even there, reflection won't make that much of a difference.  <br />
<br />
I have a 0/15/36 build right now, which I pvp a decent amount in, though if I start to pvp more, I'm going to go with a 1/14/36 for that oh so lifesaving NG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">07-30-2006, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Resto/healer druids can be very hard to kill in PvP.  True some points in a 51 resto build aren't gonna translate to PvP (if I went 51 resto I'd have Imp Engrage, not Traquility talent... Every druid get frenzied regen, and a bit of rage will help offset not having 10rage mauls).<br />
<br />
In group PVP, the longer it takes someone to kill you the more time your team has to kill him... really that simple.  You should prob work on your tatics some if you find you never get to heal.  Reflection can be an awsome talent in PvP... plus it really gives a kick to innervate aslong as your casting.  Stand towards the back, start in stealth/cat, root, cheeta, bear... live and keep other people alive and you can utilize the hell out of reflection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it may dumb to say, but the most important thing a resto Druid can do in AV is to get in a group.  Unforunately on my server, at least half the people in any given AV will refuse to join the group.  Anyway, as long as you can sit back inside a group (where you will be getting honor for other people's kills), you can be comfy healing up everyone on the front lines.  Sadly, you need to heal people outside of group as well to ensure victory even though they are being selfish and not sharing their honor.  Oh well, that will be shortly rectified in 1.12 when people are forcefully put into a raid group when entering a BG.  One great thing to do is to make a Mage friend who has the potential to tear people to shreds at range if they can stay alive.  Heal and innervate them, and make sure to ask them for some water.  Innervating a Mage will make them willing to do just about anything you would ask of em :p<br />
<br />
Oh btw, Nature's Focus is a suburb resto pvp talent, unless you are going all the way down to Swiftmend in which case you may not need it depending on your gear.</div></div><hr />

Atually, I see this as a big negative. Yes, the current method means they can reap some of the benefits (getting honor when objectives are achieved in a BG), but they don't get any honor from kills done by the raid unless they contribute. The forced raid participation means people will continue to get the objectives honor, and now they can sit back and do nothing to get the kills honor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ehh...if you're talking about a normal server then, yeah, obviously world pvp isnt going to be that popular.<br />
<br />
But anyone who plays a PVP server (&lt;3) knows that world PVP is a real big issue. Rarely you will see two people of opposing factions not beating the crap out of each other when they are questing/grinding. I usually get targetted right away as soon as I'm spotted by someone D:<br />
<br />
Then there's always frequent end game characters going &quot;newbie hunting&quot;...pffft I wont be mean like that when I'm 60 ;[...Not to mention the occasional raids on villages/towns and such. <br />
<br />
Anyway yeah, I &lt;3 world PvP ;D<br />
<br />
With my druid, I get to experience what it feels like to be a tiger or lion on the discovery channel who stalks its prey..... I'll be stealthed and then circle around it a few times....waiting for the opportune moment....Then when they least expect it....I make that ferocious Pre-emptive strike... and then viciously claw and rip into their flesh until they just lay back and accept their fate......then after I deal that glorious killing blow...I move on to track my next prey ;) <br />
