<br />
i have done the required task &quot;how the mighty have fallen&quot; but now when i talk to him he gives me a bracketed {lend her a hand}. but he wont give me the task. he gives me a sentance &quot;now theres a good lad&quot;. <br />
<br />
ive tried calling him short and ugly, and every variation of the text dialog i can imagine, but the bracketed text gives out no quest at all.:deadhorse <br />
<br />
ive heard ppl at ally valor faction have the same issue so its not a faction thing..what am i missing?</div></div><hr />

Obviously I did How the Mighty Have Fallen and I think I did Recycled Arms (the one where you open the barrels in the undead elf camp). BTW, I think Grom has 5 of the 9 tasks you need to get the aug.<br />
<br />
I've done the aug and I believe these are the 9 tasks you need (info from memory):<br />
<br />
Daria:<br />
How the Mighty Have Fallen<br />
Where Has Sister Donna Gone<br />
<br />
Brother Veras:<br />
Recycled Arms<br />
<br />
Grom:<br />
Undead Slayers (kill a ton of undead)<br />
A Mysterious Bond (kill a bunch of mushrooms, loot 8 bones)<br />
Extract Science (loot 4 glowing ichor from boneguards, loot 4 cursed bark from treants)<br />
Spark of Life (loot 5 spark of life from viridian ghosts)<br />
Carrion my Wayard Something (collect 10 undead essence; click Undead Essence Extractor when undead mobs are at 5% or less)<br />
<br />
Shearon:<br />
Recoup from the Coop<br />
<br />
All of these are single tasks. Spark of Life is fun since the viridian ghosts AE mez with mem blur.</div></div><hr />

This Ranger says he cant get any of the 5:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
I'm having the exact same problem, I have done the 4 available tasks before this and am ally to Camp Valor, but I still cant get the tasks. <br />
 <br />
Ive tried hailing him with the 4 faycite shards I have already and that makes no difference. I think it's bugged.</div></div><hr />
