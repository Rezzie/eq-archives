Any tips on how to do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe, but would be difficult. You need to first clear the mobs (3 iirc) near the entrance to the tunnel.  There are 3 mobs in the back of the tunnel, Koxiux (or his PH) and 2 other horrors (random melee/casters iirc). All three will come when you pull. Koxiux is an uncommon spawn and the wand is his rare drop. Fairly fast respawn rate (15 min maybe).<br />
<br />
This is much easier with the help of a class that can single pull the mobs.  I duoed this with a chanter around level 65. Took about 12 hours for both of us to get the wand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">05-04-2005, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you can because I did with less than what you have. You may have to evac a few times. Especially after they debuff your kei. I tried putting kei in all of the then 15 buff slots and they debuffed it all but 2 or 3 times in over 20 attempts there (yes I was unlucky on the drop). <br />
<br />
And there are 5 (not 3) mobs in the back. (I was there once when there were only three but I think it was a bug. It was my 1st time there and I thought it was normal and the camp was easy. When I came back and were 5 I freaked. There is prolly still a thread here that I posted about it). <br />
<br />
If you are lucky none of the 3 in the front will see thru camo. If not just pass them and set up to the right of the 'pole' half way between the front 3 and back 5. Root the 1st mob on the front right and the next will charge you. If root holds you have only one at a time to kill. You cant move much without getting agro from either the front 3 or the rest in back. But you can move from side to side in the cave and have a little room. Its kinda a mix of porky-pine and root/step back/ dot or heal. If the one you rooted first is still rooted, DoT it to death or DD but make it come to you so you dont agro the rest. <br />
<br />
Same for the next 2 mobs. Root the closest one and the next one will rush you. Then same as above. <br />
<br />
Now if the last one doesnt see thru camo go to the back of the cave and back up into the corner so you dont get spell interupts. Otherwise root it and then get there. Dot, DD atack at will. <br />
<br />
Now that you have broken camp its easier untill one of the mobs dispells your kei. Just keep using that back corner to wedge in and you should be able to single them easy. If 2 pop while you are medding or whatever, try and root 1 and take the other. <br />
<br />
Now if you get 3 or more on you prolly best to evac - they interupt spells alot. I also got stuck in a side wall in duck position once with 4 on me (this doesnt happen once you get in the back in the corner). I couldnt cast or evac. But now with the auto-duck option off this shouldnt be a problem. <br />
<br />
Now Koxiux cant be snared and will run (walk) at low health. So be ready to try and DD ASAP before he gets to the front 3 and you get all agro'd on you. If you do get too many on agro, make sure you kill him and then evec if needed and come back to loot. <br />
<br />
If 1 or more of the front 3 see thru camo you can try to get only 2 by rooting the front one. But I mostly got all three. Try and snare the see camo one at least and you can always evac and come back and have it waiting for you where the others wont agro. Or if you can kill it then evac and hope when you return another see invis didn't take it's place. <br />
<br />
Also... when trying to break the camp if you do get more than 3, try and snare only one and evac so when you come back it will be a single. And since I did this with much less AA and gear you might be able to easily do 2 or 3 at once but not sure.<br />
<br />
Now the bad news. Like I said before it took me over 20 camps here to get the drop. Be prepared to loot a bunch of the capes (which do sell ok in the baz). But a ranger in my guild just got last week 1st try so /shrug.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I only had around mid 5K mana at the time and prolly around 200 AA and only a few pieces of Time gear. So I think you could do it as long as you are careful.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pulvani</div><div class="date">05-06-2005, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can definitely do this with your gear and FT. I couldn't quite solo it at 65 when my gear was ornate and FT capped at 15. Vekx posted a very thorough account of the camp. You can get KEI before you go there, but don't expect it to last very long ;) On your way there, /con everything before you pass it. In my experience, mobs in the zone randomly see invis. It is sometimes possible to find a way all the way to Koxiux's cave while invis, but it's very time consuming to go all the way down one tunnel to find a see-invis mob at the end and then backtrack to find a different route. Prepare to kill a couple mobs in the way first. Also, look out for the bridges...make sure you are crossing the invisible one! <br />
<br />
I got lucky and on the first time I saw Koxiux pop, he dropped the wand. I did not expect him to be so tiny though ;)</div></div><hr />

Stand at the entrance to that hall.. back against the wall so you are even distance from the first mobs in your tunnel and the mobs to the left and right. Cast yer pet, buff him like crazy, send him in and you can single pull each one. Once you clear the hall, just hang at the dead end near where the named hangs out and you'll only have to keep up with 3 or 4 spawns.</div></div><hr />

Needless to say I pissed her off../shrug.  She gave me the saying &quot;well I have been camping for that the last 3-4 days...my reply to her was well I was in the deep and no one else was in the zone so i went for it.  I guess I was lucky in that it only took me 4+ hours :eek:</div></div><hr />
