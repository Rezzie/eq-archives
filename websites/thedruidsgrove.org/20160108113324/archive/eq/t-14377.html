I would have spent my entire 30 banked on that!!!<br />
<br />
Actually AA's look a little blah to me, can't see using the expendable ones unless I can get an aa in like 10 minutes( 5 with lesson). Even then I will max out Advanced Watching the Grass Grow AA before using them for a couple of minutes of more mana.</div></div><hr />

Wish Icefall Bear and Spirit of the White Wolf were 71 not 75 but oh well, I can wait a few days. =P<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Ancient Grove - NO MORE DS w00t! We can MGB heal at raids again. Great news.<br />
<br />
Resplendant Cascade - Not very exciting but thank Tunare we got some form of group cure upgrade cause what we have now isn't cutting it.<br />
<br />
Potential of Serpentspine - More mana, hps, ac, etc. This is great, not so much fun, but awesome none the less. Anyone know does this mean just body and mind stats (sta wis etc.) or does that include resists? If this doesn't include resists then I wish we had gotten the resist equivalent as well.<br />
<br />
Quickdraw - Good, useful, and kinda silly all at the same time. Should've just added 2 more slots for everyone long ago. This should've been a UI update not an AA. But, all that aside, at least there's finally a way to get more. I keep crack, heal, haste and itu potions on me always so another slot at least keeps me from digging around in bags to rebuff when I could be killing stuff.<br />
<br />
Labyrinthine Mind + Mental Serenity - 10 more FT. This would be exciting except with the new out of combat regen not sure it'll be as useful as it would have. Which is fine cause I love the out of combat regen, like eq2.<br />
<br />
Gathering of Spirits - Will make a nice upgrade to Convergence which is a great &quot;oh crap!&quot; heal spell. For when all the healers are stunned and stun wears off just in time to find the main tank about to go purple lol.<br />
<br />
Bigger nukes, more crit nukes and heals and dots. All in all looks better to me than our lame spell upgrades.<br />
<br />
Just say no to glyphs! I refuse to ever purchase an &quot;expendable&quot; aa. Sure, what they do looks nice but it's the whole concept. Sony's way of trying to make people stay around exp'ing forever. I absolutly refuse to waste time getting aa's just to misclick and blow 3 aa's on a hp buff while I'm standing in the bazaar or something.<br />
<br />
And then there's Combat Medic...Lvl 71...20 hp's per bandage. I think I regen more than that standing up and dotted lol. I have no words for this ability...<br />
<br />
/excited. Can't wait till Tuesday!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">09-18-2006, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Potential of Serpentspine like its predecessors (Planar Power and Chaotic Potential) does not boost resists.  The only aa that boost resists are the Innate/Advanced Innate aa line and the Trials of Mata Muram (mpg trials) aa.<br />
<br />
Whats dissappointing about the aa is there is little NEW stuff for druids that is at all useful.<br />
<br />
The Spirit of the Ancient Grove I think DOES still have a ds component, have to verify.  So it is not as great as you think Krystae.<br />
<br />
Labryinthine Mind + Mental Serenity is only 8 more FT, but that is still nice.<br />
<br />
There is healing Gift upgrade but no Healing Adept.  I live by adept, it always is there and can be relied on, but the reason there is no HA this expansion is that in the broader healing spectrum (HoT, CH, fast heals) HA is overpowering and difficult to balance and therefore was left out.<br />
<br />
GoM was initially stated in the description that it worked on spells 65 and higher.  What they didn't tell you is that it really should have read, 65-70.  Now they can charge you for a new aa, GoRM that will work on 70-75 spells.  So if you proc GoM off a 65-70 spell, you cannot get a 70-75 spell for 1 mana.  You have to wait and hope for a GoRM proc (which they haven't bothered to distinguish from a GoM proc in buff icon/name/etc, you just have to know) and then can cast a spell for 1 mana.  We have to purchase an aa just for our old ability to do exactly what it always has.  Unlike headshot/stuns/ that increase the max level but work up to that level, GoM was based on everything ABOVE the level.  This was a huge controversy in beta and I am still not sure what the final version will be like.<br />
<br />
It is a less than stellar set of aa.  We get the base aa upgrades that have come with a level increase with little that is new and exciting for druids.  Think I will just go spend the saved aa on the older aa I am still missing instead.</div></div><hr />

Maybe an animal based slow and another group heal.  This list of AA's looks like it was slapped together with no forethought over a cup of coffee.  They run out of ideas for AA's?  Zero inspiration here.  None.  <br />
<br />
*edit*  I hope this is not a complete list.  If it is, it's very disapointing.  A low fun factor set of AA's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shield Block (3/6/9, level 71/73/75 I think)<br />
This ability grants you the chance to fully block an attack when using a shield.  Increased ranks improve the chance block attacks.<br />
<br />
Energetic Attunement (5/5/5/5/5, level 71/72/73/74/75 most likely)<br />
Energetic Attunement enhances your receptivity to the potential healing power of your magical gear.  Each rank of this ability increases the maximum by which your hit point regeneration can be raised with items by 1 point.</div></div><hr />

I tested our new teddy and bleh, it's not pretty white teddy like I thought but looks like the old one :( First rank teddy hit only for 325... I had enough AAs to buy first rank of almost every new AA, but didn't have time to test them. SotAG does have DS, the text said something about &quot;harms your opponent&quot; or some such.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It also sucks because the duration's only one minute.<br />
I don't see why it's okay to give wizards a harvest that has a 10 minute refresh that gives them 5,500 mana, but it's not okay to give druids a wolf form with mana preservation that lasts longer than a minute. I'm upset.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raids are directly determined by teh amount of healing mana you typically have available (Rasherre actually posted this).  Extended how much healing you can do is a neat effect, but they are not going to make this a semi-perm effect for any priest, I am pretty sure.<br />
<br />
There is no drawback to wolf form other then duration.  None.  Wizard harvest roots them in place and stuns them iirc.  Canni exchanges HP for Mana.  We get mana savings with no drawback, but low duration.<br />

While using the ability, I honestly didn't notice it even helping very much at all. If I could, I'd ask for a refund.<br />
 <br />
They need to make it last longer than a minute or (for the love of god) make it so we can just have it on all the time with it being a random percentage from 1-10, and they also need to make our other wolf forms available indoors. The restrictions do nothing these days but hinder our class. The role-playing aspect of the game is dead, so they need to kill the thought behind it.</div></div><hr />

I just checked Lucy to see what it had to say about Spirit of the Ancient Grove.  It had DS on there and nothing about reflecting damage.  Is this confimation that SotAG and the Shaman version AA descriptions have been switched?  Or is Lucy wrong?<br />
<br />
I was really liking the reflect damage in place of a damage shield. :ohwell: <br />

Shaman are getting on my damn nerves.  (Semi-unrelated, but I just wanted to vent that for a second.)</div></div><hr />

Uhm a correction, it lasts 2 mintues. Yeah yeah no big deal. But it does seem to stack with my worn pres for beneficial and detrimental spells, saving about 1/4 of the mana cost. So being able to cast it one every 10 minutes, with an 8 minute downtime after it wears i think is decent, though i would have liked to see 3 or 4 minutes, but guess devs would cry overpower at that point. Least we got a bone thrown to us for once</div></div><hr />

No, it doesn't. Its base duration is one minute, with SCRM that makes it one and a half minutes. And the ability sucks, I would hardly consider the worthless thing being &quot;thrown a bone.&quot; Even if it were to be considered such, it doesn't make up for getting screwed in the ass with GoS/SotAG and the shaman versions of them.</div></div><hr />
