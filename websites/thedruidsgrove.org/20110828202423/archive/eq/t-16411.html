soloing i go all dots but i am a root rot druid i pull 2-3 mobs root them and load them with dots 3-4 mobs will drain the mana pool bytime they die but with the new med system who cares ya med it back fast.<br />
but over my years of play i found thers no 2 druids alike so best i can say is just muck around a bit and see what you think works best for ya</div></div><hr />

2nd what eagle said.  And like he implied, it's situational as well.  Soloing, if you're someone that can micromanage dots well, pulling multiple mobs and dotting them will by far and away blow nuking out of the water in dps and efficiency.  It's really about how much work you want to put into it.  Some druids swear by charm kiting.  I did it to death in PoN and decided going forward that that wasn't my play style; so I haven't done it since.<br />
 <br />
For raids, I can hit 1200 dps (and easily maintain over 1k consistantly) for a parse fight alternating rains and nukes in with my highest curse dot keeping NBW on hand for GoRM procs.<br />
 <br />
Groups I can't help you with.  I don't group often because I'm a blatant over-aggroer and early-nuker.</div></div><hr />

So sticking with the winters line, rains, with stormstrikes on refresh would prolly maintain a good set of dps, <br />
and if you a 1.5 / 2.0 clicking on inc mob would be stellar also</div></div><hr />

I use nearly the same pattern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madie of Wind Riders</div><div class="date">11-23-2007, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I group almost exclusively with another druid who has a Bard bot. We use the root/rot system and because we are both druids, some of our spells don't work together. So, basically I keep up Hand of Ro, and my fire DoTs of Sunscorch and Vengeance and throw in my swarm DoT's of Fire Ants and Wasp Swarm. I keep 1 nuke memmed depending on the Mob's type.<br />
 <br />
We use the Bard for mezzes - so I don't use rain spells. And I don't raid because of the hours restricted to play. I do solo sometimes and will almost invariably use the same line up as Tenielle and Fenier. Just be aware that NBW will usually break a root unless you have spent some AA's on enchanced root. Excellent spell on pulls - if you HoR first and get a GoRM proc - then it is really sweet!!</div></div><hr />

Using Rain spells is great for group play and raids..but is too un-reliable in solo play. Most of the time ive discovered, from personal experience, the first or second wave of rain will break the root and the mob will run forward, and your remaining damage will be wasted.</div></div><hr />

I don't use rains soloing unless I'm quadding, which I haven't done since PoF</div></div><hr />

The only times I switch them out are when mobs are highly resistant to cold or if there's a chanter around (ae spells + mezzed mobs = unhappy chanters). If kiting, I tend to use my two highest bug dots and my highest curse dot, along with clicky swarming death. I find that if I use any dots besides the clicky in group mode, it causes aggro issues. Might have something to do with all those crit affliction aas...<br />

I soloed via root/rot almot exclusively to 65, and have hardly hunted that way since.</div></div><hr />

Rain spells are magic resist, no?</div></div><hr />
