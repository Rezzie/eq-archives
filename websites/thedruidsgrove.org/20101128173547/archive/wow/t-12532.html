<br />
I stumbled across this site while visiting wowmb.net and wowhunter.com<br />
<br />
Nice to see there is a site for Druids<br />
<br />
Now my question is this :cool: <br />
<br />
My wife and i have recently went back to Alliance, SHe had a 60 ( mc  resto druid) and i transfered it over to help her level a mage she is leveling.<br />
<br />
What addons , Macros , Keybinds, and other things would be helpful in learning to play a druid again? ( Haven't played one in over a year)<br />
<br />
Any Help would be appriciated(sp?)  The druid right now is moonkin( looked cool just transfered it last night.) Wickedly on lightbringer.<br />
<br />
Once i get her mage to 60 then we will go to outlands and start questing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Not sure if this was the right section to post this in, if it wasn't .... Sorry in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a fairly loaded question, and one sure to find more than one response.  However, I think the majority of folks consider FERAL spec to be the &quot;best&quot; for levelling, and I would agree.  With the right gear in hand, a feral druid is a beast with little downtime while solo-questing or helping others.</div></div><hr />

Srsly though, str/agi/ap/stam. Everything a mele toon needs, really. Ask the experts as far as priority, but honestly in my long wow experience, just don't sweat gear. You'll outlevel it so quickly that in all regards it's a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

I'm already 60 this is my wife's druid that i transfered over to help her.</div></div><hr />

The main draw of leveling guides for me is the reduction of travel time while doing quests; it adds up fast. <br />
 <br />
Beyond that for feral gear get/focus on agil/str/stam. Oh at 40 get the leatherworker created wolf's head deal. Is a fun piece. The other really nice piece I got that has lasted me a long long time (as in I am currently wearing on my 68 druid's dps set) is the gryphon rider's legs from a quest in the hinterlands. Nothing else has really dropped that was good enough to replace it /shrug. <br />
 <br />
Oh and go to tkasomething.com if you need hunter info.</div></div><hr />

Well since you'Re 60 it's apice of cake,  go to the AH and load up on item &quot;... of the Bandit&quot; and &quot;... of the beast&quot;.  You can generally get them for a good price and it will last you a while.<br />
<br />
Also check for a staff with the same name, they are incredible.<br />
<br />
Since it's outland egar, it has a lot of Stam and it will boost your DPS a lot compared to lvl 60 gear Pre-BC.</div></div><hr />

Fixed.<br />
<br />
Seriously, once you start questing in Outland the quest rewards you get will make leveling to 70 a joke.  Just go with the (questing) flow.</div></div><hr />

I don't plan on leveling up until after she is 60.<br />
<br />
( i am 60 now)<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks guys. hopefully i got it straight now. lol<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:::<br />
<br />
My biggest question is what spec ( with me being 60 already) would be best to take my wife through instances and level her? ( she is 21 right now)  Once she is closer to 60 then we plan to go to outlands and level together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nukleik</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i think Feral to help her level is the best thing.  You have nearly no down time so it's really fast.<br />
<br />
So yeah load up on Bandit gear or Beast gear and start helping her right now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">04-16-2008, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello new druid ! :&gt;<br />
<br />
You will find it a lot easier to help your wife if you can tank instances, so I would suggest Feral for now, since that will allow you to tank.  Balance is a good levelling spec too but doesn't allow you to tank, however you might prefer it if you want to have a similar sort of downtime for drinking etc as your wife's mage.<br />
<br />
For feral gear, initially you want stats that are good for cat form so that you can kill things quicker while questing.  So for cat stats, get agility, strength, attack power, crit chance, etc.  Those are roughly in order of importance, from most to least important.<br />
<br />
When you start tanking instances, especially once you are level 66+, you will want to start using some bear gear, which includes heavy armor, lots of stamina and lots of agility.<br />
<br />
