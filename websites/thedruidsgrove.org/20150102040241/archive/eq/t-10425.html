<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walkers Crispie</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok theres not much disscussion here on PvP so i sort of made my own little guide on pvp v Each classes This is my perspective on Classes as lvl 45 Druid<br />
<br />
<br />
Berserker  <br />
These are basically Warriors with less hitpoints the only thing you really have to watch out for is the Stun and Snare axes although as a Druid currently lvl 45 i have never been snared with a total of 208 MR Selfbuffed but Stun has landed alot (i think they call it Head Bash) i would say get MR atleast 150+ and you will hardly ever get snared.<br />
<br />
Basic Tactic i use if i sneak up Drifting Death,Drones of Doom,Ro's Fiery Sundering,Immolate,Calefaction then i demem it quickly and bring out Firestrike and maybe use a few heals if needed:)<br />
<br />
It usually Works unless they have insane Resists but still Ro's Fiery Sundering helps a bunch and i really mean it helps:)<br />
<br />
Beastlords  <br />
Ok now lower lvls beastlords can be pretty mean in there own right the beastlord pets are Nasty however  again its resists i have not fought many Beastlords on my Druid but the ones i have fought i have made sure my FR/PR/CR resists are fairly good basically <br />
<br />
I used the same tactic as i did v the Berserker only this time before doing that i snared pet it may take 2 or 3 trys but its worth it with a snared pet the beastlord is useless.<br />
Yes he may dispell but it takes 2 or 3 dispells sometimes:) and if there gonna waste time dispelling there pet then then that gives you extra time to DoT/Nuke Etc<br />
<br />
Bards  <br />
ok now everyones like ooo bards soo unbeatable there not i have a lvl 55 on on pvp there not unbeatable. Ok anyways bards they have high resists usually but what people don't realise is they don't have an awful lot of hp.<br />
There chants are nasty if they land i'd say 130+ in everything would be enough to resist there chants 75% of the time<br />
<br />
Tactics Don't waste ur time Dotting? why cause of dispell it will just remove them instantly your best bet is to use Crimson potions to break med debuff and try to nuke them down as it takes some bards along time to regen hp back you should regen back mana before they come back so its just a stupid cycle all depends on who gives up first lol:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics<br />
Clerics i don't see many and i don't think i;ve fought any basically once there 50+ you won't kill them unless ur geared far superior they can get away easy so i don't really have any tactics for Clerics sorry:(<br />
<br />
Druids<br />
Ok V other Druids it all depends on gear here its basically a battle of Resists what i would reccomend is buying Pumice Stones to dispell DoTs if they try to DoT you its helpful:) so basically just try to DoT/Debuff/Nuke again if they dispell your DoTs are first just go to debuff/nuke not much else you can do :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanters<br />
Ok for a Druid this is a pretty easy class to beat there main spells are MR Based but they have the pesky Tash and Runes mez and mana drain but they have Very little in the way of hp and can't heal themselfs also keep counteract poison up it gets rid of tash which can hurt a bundle:) i'd imagine you'd need 150ish MR to be safe from most enchanter nukes around my lvl also if chanter uses charmed mob on you just dispell it:)<br />
<br />
but theres away around this :) Crimson potions once again and use yours DoTs mainly it slips under the rune and dmgs them once they get around 40% life Nuke them and break the rune it  should only take 1 or 2 nukes<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages<br />
ok basically like Enchanters Very few hp no way to heal themselfs but they have no runes either so basically all you have to do V these is DoT them but always remember to snare the pet but anyways always Remember to DoT they are incredbily lethal to a class that can't heal itself and that has very few hitpoints but also remember the mages main nukes are FR/MR which are easy to raise so if you can keep them up your pretty good :)<br />
<br />
ok thats my guide  so far will add more later if you like it lol  just tired atm tell me what ya think :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
 <br />
Do`s<br />
 <br />
*Winged death line of dots<br />
*Keep max DS (DS hits for 100% damage in PvP)<br />
*Use Hand of ro / Immo / Summer's line of spells<br />
 <br />
Don't`s<br />
 <br />
*snare -- wont stick on players<br />
*root -- wont stick on players<br />
*Vengence line of dots<br />
*E`ci / WInters line of spells (not matter if the person has better FR than CR)*Stuns<br />
 <br />
Great Pvp items (toys)<br />
*Orb of clinging death<br />
*Dark mace of thought<br />
*hammer of hours<br />
*Greatstaff of power (p5 2hb, might have name wrong)<br />
*blade of the tempest<br />
 <br />
Class specific tactics and hints<br />
 <br />
Clerics<br />
try to use as less mana as posible.  They'll let you get them down to 50% before they heal, sometimes if you burst dps and get lucky with crits you can kill them here.  If you keep Oaken Vigor on you youll more than likely wont have to heal yourself at all, but ethierway clerics are a long kill, but pretty low risk.<br />
 <br />
Enchanters<br />
If you have a blade of tempest, this will make your day a LOT easier.  It's imparitive that you dot yourself , because once they get you locked down they take the upper hand.  As long as you can avoid their mez its an easy duel.<br />
 <br />
Shaman<br />
Expect a very very long duel.  Their dps is very overrated, but their heals can heal their HP faster than a druid can drop em.  If they canni 5 and get down under 50 you can burst dps and kill em if you get lucky with crits / resists.  Dont worry about pets, they can be snared / rooted np.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Mage<br />
Snare / root pet (1), this applies to any pet from any class.  Once pet is locked down you got em.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Warrior<br />
The only danger with warriors are crippling mighty strikes.  Once they eat DS to 35%, back up and switch to casting, because even the highest hp druids can get eaten by this if they get lucky interupting you <br />
 <br />
Druid<br />
If you don't have a Orb of Clinging death and your oppenet does, don't try.  Also, its best to dispell their dots off of you as they land.  <br />
 <br />
Necro<br />
A necro will be a short duel no matter who wins.  Don't conserve any mana at all with them, because they can conserve it better.  If you get the necro to chain lifetap, their mana could very likely be going down fast than yours.  Go all out dps from the start and just try your best to dps faster than their lifetaps heal.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
(1) -- The resistbility of snare / root on pets might have been changed from the last time I dueled a mage (Fall 2003), though I cannot confirm it ethierway</div></div><hr />

My guild is planning on doing dueling tournament (1 on 1)  We have plenty of bstlords so i was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to deal with them.  thanks.  Btw, i think i screwed something up in my magelo with the AC/ATK bc both are not that low. (the top post is for level 45s...so...)<br />
<br />
Lookin for info against classes that are  67-70</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">01-11-2005, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since your hp may be too low to take a whole lot of hits from their pet, you should try to get the pet snare / rooted asap.  Once the pet is under control, you wont have to worry about killing it at all, just the BST.  If the BST is duel wielding , you could just cast one round of MR based dots than let him eat your DS.  If he has a slow 2 hander with a good ratio, you might wanna get him down a lil more with MR dots before going toe to toe.  If the BST doesn't melee you when you want him to, just run up and start to melee him -- of course your melee damage wont do any major damage to him, but generally people react to that by meleeing back ;p.<br />
 <br />
BST spells are too much to worry about, but their pets have stuns.  BST pets have lots of hp's and they can always summon a new one if you kill it, so killing the pet wont help too much.  If the pet is SOW`d you might wanna dispell it first before u kite it to snare / root -- youll get a few resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For any melee class, i've always just backed up into a corner and tanked them. Even with 2 or 3 melee on me, i've never found it to be a problem keeping myself healed. For a quick surprise, you can cast oaken guard and spirit of the grove together. I've seen rogues kill themselves on the DS before they've even realized their health drop. The only exception is against a monk with a tranquil staff or Ton Po's bo stick or an SK. 100 blows is annoying. With an SK, keep health over 50% at all times or you're likely get disc HTed. Other than tanking a melee, you can always use a dispell item (pvp merchant pumices are good or that lantern from the mines in Ssra) in combination with annul to remove their levi, then climb up on a tree or some other annoying place and cast on them.<br />
<br />
Rogues and Bards have weapons that proc tendonslice, -300 MR resist snare, and berzerkers get an innate ability to leg slice or something, unresistable snare. I don't know if this is the same on non-pvp servers, but snares only last for 12 seconds or so in pvp. It's really only good for keeping someone from running away.<br />
<br />
If it's 1vs1 against a caster, something you may want to consider memming is rain spells. You can get 1 nuke off in the middle of the rain for extra burst DPS. Of course, they need to be standing still, so you may need to time it, like maybe while they're casting a spell. If you have a ToT mace, you should be in good shape.<br />
<br />
Finally, if you are fighting a bard, forget about it, run (if you can) or gate/port. A bard in an open zone who knows how to pvp and has ancient mez will be a lot to handle. Bard's mana drain is percentage based. Bard mez cannot be dispelled, if you are caught offguard, you're going to lose all your buffs and all you mana. Bard's can click items while running, so if they ever get low on health, they'll just run out of range while clicking heal potions or trakanon bp. If you dot or debuff them, they'll dispell it and they've probably got psalms going so likely most of your nukes will be resisted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Why not to use Vengeance line of dots? they are harder to remove for classes that cant cure curses, but they can be a mana hog.<br />
<br />
Also ive found that the 2 lowest resist on the mayority of people are COLD and DISEASE, yes so ive used cold nukes namely ancient chaos frost and Winter's on some people and they have landed for a lot more than fire nukes.<br />
<br />
Also gotta take in consideration people's idea of Druids... most people think you will nuke fire most of the time so they buff up that resist if they are dumb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ornette</div><div class="date">01-14-2005, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mez isn't so much of a problem with enchanters, dotting yourself is fine. Only thing you'll need to make sure of is having the dot really far down your buff list. I keep 11 right clicks as the first 11 buff slots and I still have problems sometimes keeping the dot from getting dispelled, glowing lantern + recant magic + pvp merchant pumice will remove 20 buff slots in about 10-12 seconds. If you're dealing with a bard, and you've dotted yourself, he'll just run oor and manadrain and dispell you. The mez is really only an issue if you get jumped, if you get mezzed, there's probably no change to get a dot on yourself unless the person you're fighting is an idiot.<br />
<br />
One thing i've noticed about the cold line of nukes, even if the person you are fighting has high cold resists, I've found there's more of a chance to land a partial hit than a complete resist compared with fire nukes. There's been time's I flat out fired off cold nukes and rain spells without even debuffing and got 2k+ crits.<br />
<br />
As far as the vengeance line of dots, they're pretty hard to land in pvp unless the FR is debuffed to around 100. Against a class with radiant cure, there's no point, since the curse counters are seperate from the debuff counters, so you're hand of ro and immolation will get stripped along with vengeance. I'd say this dot is a case by case basis, not something I usually mem for pvp.</div></div><hr />

Even with Immo and hand on, the resist rate i have in Pvp with VotS is ~50%..with the mana cost of it i dont see much point with.  WIth that being said, theres not too many &quot;intermediatly&quot; geared peeople, everyone is ethier gimp as hell or time / qvic+ geared -- so anyone with any HP at all has high resist.<br />
 <br />
Also ive found that the 2 lowest resist on the mayority of people are COLD and DISEASE, yes so ive used cold nukes namely ancient chaos frost and Winter's on some people and they have landed for a lot more than fire nukes.. <br />
Anyone who u easily land E`ci / glacier on isnt worth dueling,.. resist rate on that is terrible.  Since we can Debuff FR 100+ , buffed up FR dont matter too much.  I also just generally see a better hit rate with fire than ice too, w/o debuffing.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Also, i dunno what kinda peeps your refering too with low CR heh. Seems like everyone out there has CR as one of their highest..esp since everyone and their grandamother prolly has a few piece form PoFire etc.<br />
 <br />
Ethierway, most my actual damage i cause in a duel i do via MR based dots. Even a PoV`d bard will get hit by these. its true these are easy to dispell, but its easy (and mana efficent) to just keep renewing for a 2 tick hit -- nukes rarely land for full.</div></div><hr />

Its a very long fight, so use DS to deal the most possible damage with the least mana expenditure. Apply the usual attack debuff to reduce his dps and wait. Heal early to give you extra chances of landing one while he stuns you. Don't blast nuke him the first two or three times his hp bar goes low. Wait till he has used up lay hands and you have drained most of his mana before applying nukage.</div></div><hr />
