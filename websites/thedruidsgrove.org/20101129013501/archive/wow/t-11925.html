Ever had a really good idea and wanted to make your own? Then this guide is for you. This will be the first in a series of guides covering the capturing of in game footage, than using that footage and editing it into a movie. By the end of this guide you should have a basic short film that you can then expand upon. The only limitation is your imagination!<br />
Section One: Introduction<br />
Before we get started you're going to need a feel tools. For anyone who has seen my &quot;Dual Shadows&quot; series, all 4 videos were created using Fraps and Windows Movie Maker. As such, those are the tools we'll be using in the guide.<br />
<br />
Fraps:Video Capturing Software<br />
Download:Fraps[/URL]<br />
<br />
Information:Fraps is a retail product. The guide will work just as well with the shareware version, but it has recording limitations among various other options locked out. I'm currently using the retail version 2.0.<br />
<br />
Windows Movie Maker:Video Editing Software <br />
Download:WMM 2.0 <br />
[URL=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/moviemaker2.mspx&quot;] (http://*********/downloads/wowtool/Frapsv2.0.zip)<br />
Information:If you have Windows XP, you have Windows Movie Maker. If for some reason you do not, follow the link above to download the latest version.<br />
You should be able to find it within your drive here:<br />
Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Entertainment<br />
<br />
Notice:Recording is a very taxing operation for a PC. 1 Minute of uncompressed footage runs around 300 Megs of hard disk space. Make sure you have at least 5 gigs of open hard disk space at any given time while recording/editing. Disk space aside, you will need a PC with upper end spec's in order to record effectively. The only way to find out is simply follow the Fraps section below.<br />

<br />
Now you know the basics behind capturing and editing your footage. I encourage you to play around with Windows Movie Maker. It may not be the most advanced program, but it has a lot of utility. In my next guide I will cover a few more advanced pieces of WMM. Such as:<br />
<br />
*Adding Music<br />
*Fading Music In/Out<br />
*Video Effects<br />
*Adding New Font Types<br />
*Various Text Effects<br />
<br />
If you haven't already seen my Dual Shadow Series you can view the movies below. Each was created using Fraps and WMM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but....<br />
<br />
its heavy on system load and memory, if you have a bad latency you dont wanna try FRAPs<br />
<br />
and before you think of sharing the FRAPs video realize a 5 min video is roughtly about 1 gig in size<br />
<br />
but there is a few programs that you can used to fix that.<br />
<br />
i have a few videos i tossed up on youtube if anyone wants a gander<br />

I downloaded the Game Cam Lite trial, and was so impressed I paid for it.  I use Windows Movie Maker to edit my videos.  It has limitations of course, but it's good enough to make simple WoW videos.</div></div><hr />
