<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend of mine had asked, &quot;why are you so upset over this crap, it's just a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
My reply was an analogy. I asked him to imagine playing a game of Monopoly at another friend's house. Everyone picked their playing pieces; his friends took the thimble, dog, etc., and he got the car token. Everyone went around the board once and collected their $200 for passing Go. After a few times around, everyone continued getting their $200, but when he passed go the fifth time, the banker gave him $100. At this point my friend stopped me and said &quot;huh? that's not right, everybody knows it says right in the Monopoly rules that passing go gets $200 for everyone no matter what piece they're playing&quot;.. to which I replied, &quot;well you're playing the car, and the car only gets 100 bucks when it passes go, starting with the fifth time around-- these are the house rules. Would you like to quit now?&quot; <br />
<br />
He said, &quot;Nah it's just 100 bucks, the real money is in real estate anyway.&quot; <br />
<br />
So I told him to imagine the game continued, and he landed on the &quot;Go to Jail&quot; panel, and on the next roll, got a double to get out. &quot;But wait, you can't get out like that, you have to wait until the Thimble lands on the Just Visiting panel to get you out.&quot; <br />
<br />
He said &quot;okay this is getting ignorant.&quot; <br />
<br />
I told him to be patient, there might be other house rules that work to the car's advantage. He said okay.<br />
<br />
I continued with this hypothetical game, and told my friend he landed on Boardwalk -- and of course wanted to buy it!<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;Wait a minute though, the car isn't allowed to own dark blue properties, house rules.&quot; <br />
<br />
He said &quot;what the hell kind of house rules are these if there are all these crazy restrictions on just one playing piece?! Jesus H Christ, I don't think i'd want to play at whoever's house this is!&quot; <br />
<br />
I replied, &quot;Well it's just a game... why are you so upset?&quot;<br />
