<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">11-09-2008, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guessed it.  I didn't just randomly go inactive for over a month...Think it may finally be hibernate time.<br />
<br />
I'm abroad at the moment, getting home at the start of December.  The prospect of WotLK just doesn't really excite me anymore and I'm considering simply not buying it.<br />
<br />
I haven't told my guild that I feel this way yet.  I'm going to hang on and see how I feel when all my RL friends are playing it.  I strongly suspect it may be time to move on, though.  Music is calling me again, and I'm considering spending a great deal of money to buy one of these (http://www.bananasmusic.com/multimedia/7980/BodyImage/virusTIperspBig.jpg).<br />
<br />
So this is the inevitable hibernate post which at one point I truly believed I would never make.  Well, here we are.  So do you guys want to know my deep, dark secret?  :&gt;  I'm sure you do. Well, I hope so at least, because I'm going to tell you anyway.  What could possibly motivate one man to become so utterly, unashamedly obsessed with Druids, to the point of clocking up hundreds, even thousands of posts on this and other forums, not to mention thousands of hours of game time?<br />
<br />
Here's how it happened.<br />
<br />
I dated a girl for a number of years, she was the love of my life, and when WoW appeared we played the game together.  She was a druid.<br />
Time passed, and eventually so did she - two weeks following the split of my band (http://www.starfallonline.co.uk), although we both continued to play Warcraft on the same server.  Desperate to regain some of what I had lost from her, I &quot;became&quot; her druid in all but name.  I adapted Alamo's style of communication towards something much closer to the way she used to behave towards me, and in doing so was able to take refuge inside the game.  I lost myself so deeply inside that for a while real life just seemed like an inconvenient chore.<br />
<br />
Warcraft above all is escapism, and I sought to escape to a world where things hadn't panned out the way they did in real life.  When all is said and done, In-Character-Annikk was a mere sad reflection of my feelings for her which remain to this day, fully 800+ days after the event.<br />
<br />
Regardless, one has to move on some time.  I'm too young to be trapped into a circle so bitter for the rest of my life.  So this is my message I'm sending you guys to explain, more for my benefit than yours, where I came from, who I am, and where I am going.  Perhaps someday I'll return to the game and be able to appreciate my druid at face value.  I'll be asking all the questions, instead of answering them. :&gt;<br />
<br />
Until then, this druid is hibernate..<br />
