If so, does mining automatically switch you to caster form?  What about flight form, will it switch to caster form automatically when you tap a vein?</div></div><hr />

Back in the day, I can say for certain you could not. However, I think there was a patch added not to long ago (and not in the patch message) where getting a herb would automatically cancel flight form. Don't quote me on that; I'll have to verify it tonight.</div></div><hr />

There's a slight trick to it....you have to be ON the ground for it to work ( where you move slower ). You can still jump to take off and avoid aggro ( like on Netherwing Ledge &gt;.&lt; )<br />

There was a previous patch that completely removed the ability to herb while in flight form, but it did not cancel the form if you attempted to do it, instead it simply would not let you.  With 2.2 they brought it back, but made it so you had to be on the ground.  With odd clipping issues sometimes it is just easier to swap forms and herb :(<br />

You CAN skin in flight form as well....I'm not sure about mining.</div></div><hr />

Ahh yes, I forgot about that little trick.</div></div><hr />
