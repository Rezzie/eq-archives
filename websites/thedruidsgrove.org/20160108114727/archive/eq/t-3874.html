[i]It's a tough call on the top three.  Identical base AC and HP for the two with the highest AC, but one trades off 100 mana for an additional 7 to all resists.  The Silver Necklace also has 15 Sta, and thus more HP, while the NoW has 15 AC, and thus more AC.  These two are roughly equivalent.<br />
<br />
The Talisman of the Burrower might even be preferred, thanks to the effect (adds 2 more mana per level; so if you are level 60 you would get a 120 mana Bonus for 270 Ticks...about 27 mins.)  You also give up 20 raw AC, get a split in the resistances, better rounded stats, slightly lower HP, but much more mana (assuming you aren't at 255 wis already), not even counting the effect.  A tough choice among these three options.  I lean towards the ToB, myself, due to the effect.<br />
<br />
Of the rest, don't overlook the Shrouded Medallion, which is a random drop in Maiden's Eye, and within reach of a soloing druid (or a small group).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalinn</div><div class="date">02-10-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the silver charm of tranquility wins top spot on this one.  you lose 7svall in comparison to valtrons, but you gain 100 mana and 45 hp (from 15 sta).  the BEST part of the charm is that its versatile, it can go on your wrist as well as your neck.  therefore it gives you more upgrade options, as in you can upgrade either your wrist or neck, whichever would be a higher upgrade to whatever item you would wear there instead of charm, and put the charm on the opposite.  that versatility is good for tunare druids especially, since you can switch the charm to your wrist if soloing and using wardens symbol.<br />
<br />
the only one of the rest that could come close to rivaling these top two is the Collar of Tavuel Xakreum, purely due to the FT2 effect since the stats are junk in comparison.<br />
<br />
i would shy away from talis of the burrower, at least for a while as its too new yet to know what its effect stacks with.  its a 2 mana regen, but its a triggerable spell so its very possible it wont stack with form/mask of the hunter.</div></div><hr />

It stacks with KEI, Mask of the Hunter. But for the time being it won't be useful as a druid until they fix this stacking issue. I honestly do not believe that it was intended to stack in this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless, if it doesn't stack with PoG, it isn't very useful for a level 60 druid.  I'd go with the Silver due to the mana and HP, in that case.</div></div><hr />

but even if it gives 120 mana at lvl 60, thats not enough to offset the rest of the stats to make it anywhere near silver charm or valtrons.</div></div><hr />

It's my favourite because it's the one I have and don't think I'll ever change it ;) If I was given the chance to change it I'd take the silver charm or an amulet of the dreadgazer. Talisman of the burrower has good stats but I'd rather have Truesight than a proc that doesn't stack with my own mana regen spells.</div></div><hr />

I'd take free right click roots over anything.  I'd pay more than 10k for something like that if i could use it.  To me rclick free roots means all free mana expenditure(es guants, es arms, and if you had your epic).  I guess it doesnt mean anything for the raiding Druid, but for the common Druid, its invaluable imo.  Even in groups it would be free root parking everything.  I cant tell you how much mana i waste just on roots trying to root park magic resistant mobs.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for Karana worshippers equivalent Verant, and it'd better not be something stupid like rclick enduring breath or something.  I probly jinxed myself with that.  Oh well, Verant and Karana suck until they gimme rclick root for Karana.</div></div><hr />

warden symbol is crap for anything other than soloing, which a lot of us dont do much of.  in the high end game you cant afford to be sitting there with junk in a spot when you could have any one of a huge number of items to boost resists, hp, mana.  my charm goes back and forth from neck to non-drones-hotkeyed wrist, depending on if soloing or grouping/raiding.  versatility in items is just as good as versatility in spells =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now i'm just waiting for this wednesday patch, when they finally fix the stacking issues with all the clarity line of spells. I'm not too optimistic tho, since it will probably be overlooked. The very fact that KEI could be overwritten by all the lesser versions of clarity including breeze, was just a quick fix, becuase they couldn't figure out how to avoid having all the clarity line of spells from stacking with each other. I'll check on wednesday to see if there is any change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean to say, it's useful for everything EXCEPT large single-target raids.  That's a lot more than soloing.  Mana-free and slot-free root is far more useful than you might think.  Certainly something you will notice in your gameplay, as opposed to stats, which you will never notice unless you look at those pretty green numbers to stroke your ego.  &lt;img src=http://www.geocities.com/lag999/biggrin.txt&gt;<br />
<br />
in the high end game you cant afford to be sitting there with junk in a spot when you could have any one of a huge number of items to boost resists, hp, mana.<br />
<br />
You can't &quot;afford&quot; it?  What exactly you are doing in the high end game nowadays that requires all the special items?  Last I remember, druids can pretty easily hide from many AEs and melee, and mostly do spot healing, weak nuking (on non immune NPCs), a buff here and there, and of course play taxi before and after.  Has this changed dramatically?  If not, a little mana or resist here or there isn't going to mean much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalinn</div><div class="date">02-11-2002, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually no, i said exactly what i meant.  and i know exactly how useful the warden symbol is, since i use one myself.  the long casting time makes it unfavorable to use for CC if you are grouping, not to mention the shorter average duration compared to the lvl 56 root.  as a root to stop runners its also unfavorable due to that long casting time, and the mana:damage efficiency of our 56 root is excellent for a small fast nuke.<br />
<br />
even soloing, i find myself using 56 root much more than warden symbol, mainly because with the symbol i  notice i often lose more med time than i feel its worth.  one other thing i  notice is that it takes me slightly longer to kill things, since you are doing 10 dd instead of 190, and the 56 root damage adds up even after a couple roots.<br />
<br />
when it comes to hp, mana, resists, you can never have enough.  and that extra 10 saves may mean the difference between life or death when dealing with some of the nasty ae's we encounter.  an extra hundred mana can mean a cure on someone to save their life, and thus help prevent the raid from failing.  or even an extra root to get a mob off a cleric/enc and onto the tanks beating on it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">02-11-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kalinn says:  that extra 10 saves may mean the difference between life or death when dealing with some of the nasty ae's we encounter. an extra hundred mana can mean a cure on someone to save their life, and thus help prevent the raid from failing.<br />
<br />
Note the underlined words.  This is the same argument the stat worshippers used back in the day.  While theoretically, those things CAN and MAY affect your performance, how many times can you affirmatively say they DID they have an effect?<br />
<br />
the long casting time makes it unfavorable to use for CC if you are grouping, not to mention the shorter average duration compared to the lvl 56 root.<br />
<br />
Things must have changed, because I remember root having a variable duration, and often breaking long before the maximum duration.  Each break, or resist, means you waste ANOTHER 75 mana or whatever it is.  That may not seem like much, but it does add up.  With an item, you can simply chain cast it and have a basically guaranteed forever root for zero mana.  Another bonus for the low level root is the super-low damage, which helps to prevent triggering of the summoning code.<br />
<br />
Also you're forgetting that items don't gobble up your recast time, and thus they can actually be faster when you want to cast a spell right before or after.  So let's say you want to cast root and then immediately winged death, with the root spell it would be 1.8 + 2.5 = 4.3 seconds for the root portion versus the casting time for the item alone, which I think is 4.0 (but correct me if I'm wrong).<br />

By using items and bypassing the recast time delay, you are also removing the period of vulnerability associated with recast time.  Unless game mechanics have changed, you are completely unable to cast a spell after you complete a spell and are awaiting the recast delay.  A lot can happen in 2.5 seconds, and it's frustrating to have to sit there and just wait.  With an item effect, you can rest assured that you can instantly cancel it at any time and start that heal on your dying group member.<br />
<br />
The items that give you clickable root and snare are far more useful than you think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
an intelligent person will alternate their items and spells, no matter what root they use.  so if you use spell root, you do not lead off with WD next, because that would be stupid.  instead you would lay on drones, then WD/Boro, then scim if you have it.  with that setup you totally negate any recast time on your spells and allow for continuous casting.<br />
<br />
roots do have a random duration, however a lower level root has a lower AVERAGE duration, which is why we see symbol root breaking most probably in half the time as spell root.  also, what you are neglecting to take into acct in your chain casting root scenario is the absence of meditation.  if you meditate even for 24 seconds you regain all the mana spent on one 56 root plus some extra (counting only meditation mana regen).  besides, why would anyone in their right mind stand and chain cast root?  with the warden symbol, you can combine casting and medding with careful timing so that there is no break in either your root OR your meditation.  if you are going to use the symbol for your root, at least do so with a little forethought so that you maximize your mana gain while you minimize your mana expenditure.<br />
<br />
im still not sure exactly which position it is that you are arguing here.  are you saying that one should stick with the symbol even if items such as the silver charm are available to them?  because thats just silly and shortsighted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have a lower maximum duration, for sure, and that translates to a lower average duration.  I will also grant you that the higher level roots have a lower initial chance to resist.  But what is your evidence that, at each tick, the chance to break is higher for the lower level root?<br />
<br />
also, what you are neglecting to take into acct in your chain casting root scenario is the absence of meditation.<br />
<br />
Well technically, you don't need to lose any meditation ticks when you use the item.  Just play the &quot;canni dance&quot; with it.<br />
<br />
besides, why would anyone in their right mind stand and chain cast root?<br />
<br />
If you need something to absolutely stay put, that is almost a 100% sure way unless (a) it summons (and even then it will take a while) or (b) you are extremely unlucky and get a long series of resists combined with an early break.  If you wait until it breaks with a regular root, it will have moved by the time you recast.<br />
<br />
im still not sure exactly which position it is that you are arguing here.<br />
<br />
1) Stats mean diddly on a per-item basis.  They're there mainly to make you feel good about yourself and not feel guilty about the time you just wasted getting them.  You will not notice the difference on even an uber item just because of stats.  Only in the aggregate (over many items) do stats mean anything, and the effect is still subtle.<br />
<br />
2) You will notice effects that are useful, because they affect your gameplay.<br />
<br />
3) Therefore, useful effects make an item far better than a no-effect, stat-laden item.</div></div><hr />

This got nerfed awhile back, at least with another item.  I don't know if it was nerfed with the Tunare neckpiece as well.<br />

The modern form was using these items while sitting on horseback.  But that got nerfed last month as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
effects only make a particular item like the warden symbol better in SOME situations.  to ignore all other situations and continue in the same gear setup as you do in others is ignorant and lazy.  like those people who consider resist gear unneccessary for dragon raiding, you do yourself and your guild/group a disservice when you do not optimize yourself for the situation at hand.<br />
<br />
you go ahead and continue to wear your warden symbol full time.  i will continue to wear my charm and swap in the symbol only when i need it.  i am content with my &quot;pretty stats&quot; and the knowledge that i am optimizing my potential, and living longer too =)<br />

The added resists your gonna get with another neck piece instead of Tunares symbal is negligible in terms of added effectiveness.  The only thing your really getting is personal satisfaction in the numbers of that extra few pts of resist or whatever, which as a whole doesnt mean much.  Nobody really said much about swapping, since i believe Kalinn, your the one who stated that Tunares symbol was garbage for anything but soloing.  Personally, i think it has its uses in groups as well as possibly big mobs, but every druid does different things in groups.  I know my mana tends to go down pretty fast if i'm rooting alot of things, and a mana free version of that would be nice to have.  I also think root durations, until you get the 56 root, arent that far apart.  I'm sure the Tunare symbol root can hold as long as 44 root(whatever its called) on many occasions.  I've heard people state their able to get numerous lumi staff blasts in using tunare symbol root without it breaking sometimes.</div></div><hr />

We dont always have clarity or mana song.  Which imo is why ES gaunts(snare) and something like Tunares Symbol would be very useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, this neclace is a Godsend for soloing.  I'm sorry to hear Karana worshipers got the short end of the stick.  Maybe you could get a necklace with Invoke Lightning or Gate or something on it.  I know I would be upset if I didn't have access to this item.  Maybe this could be another thread?  I'm sure there are some good ideas out there.<br />

On the contrary, debate is what makes this board interesting (for some).  I know I would much rather read detailed pro/con arguments about whether X or Y is better over simple &quot;use X it r0x0r&quot; type posts.  Scirocco's initial post even invites debate, for this reason.  If it worries you that people are challenging your conclusions and assumptions, you could always concede the argument by ignoring it.</div></div><hr />

And for the raiding druid, like me, the symbol sucks. I don't solo much at all, I'm always raiding. The only time's I've done exp since Luclin was out with ae groups, no use for it there.<br />
<br />
I don't see the point of it saving a spell slot. Hell the rare times when I do go solo in seb I keep soe memmed for when I gate out to refresh it. It's not like we're lacking for spell slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though he can't use it.<br />
<br />
Not trying to rub it in,,,sorry Broom.<br />
<br />
Here's why the Warden is great...<br />
<br />
Attainable and usable at level 24 for a druid, can't say that for most of the Best of Neck.  Most clickys do not start being usable until much higher(46).  <br />
Over the course of it's usable life,,,that is a WHOLE lot of mana.<br />
It is an extra spell slot.  How much would you pay for another slot,,,,me 10K each right now easy.<br />
Sure, it is not an uber raiding item,,,who cares?<br />
<br />
I am not disputing that it is not the Best of the Best,,,but it for most Tunare druids a very good item, including me.  And I raid just fine, tyvm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Average is about 4 blasts.  When I used the lumi like that,,,I would usually just alternate them though.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition...<br />

I use it for chain casting root for CC all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I do think it's quite useful at certain times and am sorry for the lack of a comparable item for karana druids. <br />
<br />
My idea for karana druids would be to give their symbol the low level cleric stun spell.<br />
<br />
The innoruuk symbol gives dark elven clerics and troll shamans the ability to snare mobs, so I dont think that giving newbie cleric stun to karana druids would be too overpowering.<br />
