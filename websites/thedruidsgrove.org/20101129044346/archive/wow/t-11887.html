<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">07-11-2007, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lately, I have found myself more and more often being whispered - out of nowhere - to be the healer for a group for lower level instances - EG. SM, ZF, Uldaman.  I am a softy, and I like to help people as much as possible, so I usually cave and agree to assist.  ( Sigh, I know.  :shuffle: )<br />
<br />
I usually have great healing experiences, and as healers, you all understand how good it feels when someone actually takes the time to say &quot;Thanks!  Great healing!&quot;  :dance: <br />
<br />
Now, I want everyone to know that PRIOR to joining a Pug that is asking me for my help, I advise ALL members that I am feral - NOT RESTO.  In fact, I have a &quot;My Mana is Low!&quot; macro that is used often, and comes in quite handy.<br />
<br />
(Here comes the rant)<br />
<br />
So after already being advised of my being FERAL and MY MANA IS LOW.....why do these same people still holler HEAL! HEAL! when it is obvious that - MY MANA IS LOW - and I cannot????  <br />
<br />
I am not expecting an answer to that question.  This could go on forever.  I really just needed to blab it out.<br />
<br />
You know the tool tips that appear during start-up?  Here's one I would like to see:<br />
<br />
&quot;It is considered polite NOT yell at your feral healer, who you asked to join, who is doing a bang-up job of keeping you alive and sometimes just cannot help running out of mana when you draw aggro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm, too long?:whistle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">07-11-2007, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The trouble with low level instances is that a lot of people are playing alts are whatever and just don't care about CC/aggro/mana, all those things everyone should be caring about.  They just kinda get lazy and think &quot;eh we'll be okay, this place is easy&quot;.  Especially in pugs.  &gt;.&gt;  I was trying to tank ZF a few months back on my pally, I was a bit low for the instance so I was getting a lot of misses/resists, and this lock just... would not stop pulling/taking aggro off me.  He was like 8 levels above me, so sure, he outgeared me of course, but it was still annoying, because even though he outgeared me, he still died quicker than I did.  &gt;.&gt;  It was an alright run, just very messy... kind of annoying.  I felt sorry for the healer who had to try and keep both him and me up, she was a shadow priest too.  Near the end she just started letting him die, which is well, sometimes the only thing you can do with overzealous DPS when they take aggro left and right.<br />
<br />
I try and avoid healing pugs with my feral druid, but now and again I get asked to by a friend, so I do.  I usually make it clear from the beggining, &quot;yes, I'm feral, yes I can heal pretty well, but please remember I'm feral, so try and not take 29873927292 damage a second if you don't need to, and keep an eye on my mana&quot;.  Usually people'll listen, sometimes not.  I let overzealous DPS die all the time though if I'm too busy keeping the tank up, and hell, if I'm the only healer, yeah, they get to run back.  When things get messy, I'm keeping that tank up at all costs, cause they're the only one watching my back in most cases (in bad-ish pugs at least) That usually teaches 'em to stop pulling aggro.  :D<br />
<br />
And that HEALHEALHEAL thing, man that annoys me like crazy.  I'd just tell them, &quot;I am healing, you don't need to shout for me to.  if my healing ain't enough for you then I suggest rolling a healer yourself&quot;  It usually works.</div></div><hr />

It's sad to have to turn someone down when they whisper you for an instance, but you should never accept an invite if you think it will just be a wipefest.<br />
<br />
Here's a handy way to distinguish a probably-good party from a probably-rubbish party:<br />
<br />
Good: Hello, sorry for bothering you.  We are going to Shadow Labyrinth and we need a healer.  Would you like to come?  We are 4 and can summon you :&gt;<br />
<br />
Bad: resto?<br />
Bad: SL?<br />
Bad: u wanna come sl<br />
<br />
I get these &quot;bad&quot; types of whispers all the time.  I get so many of them that I've come to just ignore the impolite, poorly-worded ones.  On a few occasions I've tried some semi-mediocre sounding groups, but I've almost always regretted it.<br />
A &quot;good&quot; whisper is also any whisper that specifically mentions you by name - this at least shows they haven't copied/pasted a flowery sentence to 20 people, of which you are one.<br />
<br />
<br />
With all this said, even if the group you find yourself in is clearly full of 12 year olds, it's still best to try and be polite and courteous.  If you try to stick to this policy throughout your WoW career then eventually you will become known across your server as being a good durid, and the types of group you get invited to will get a lot better too.<br />
