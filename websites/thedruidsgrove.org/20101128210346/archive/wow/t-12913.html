I cannot get Closetgnome to work, I think I'll have to do the same thing (delete all CG files including saved settings) and try again.<br />

And WTF, Pitbull now has a million folders rather than a single folder.  Ugh! At least it seems to be working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
esp the one that was towards the right hand side and let u put in the standard price for an item and how many of an item u wanted to put up on the AH. :( :(<br />

<br />
and yes itemrack is now working but i had to re-create the gear sets as never managed to find them from the previous version of itemrack.</div></div><hr />

I was like, lets do some PvP....10 minutes later, &quot;this isn't worth the effort&quot;</div></div><hr />

Seems a bit difficult to setup, but then so was closegnome.  The auto switch feature seems sort of pointless even for druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use it to automatically equip my tanking/dps/healing mainhand/offhand/idol when I need to switch forms mid fight.  Although you could do it with macros, too.</div></div><hr />
