<br />
My questions are to figure out whether I choose balance or rejuv, and questions about certain skills. I'm a newbie mind you, so i'm not sure what all the skills do<br />
<br />
Rejuv- Furor and rage sound nice, while I could also cast an improved rejuv before changing back...wouldn't son be essential in pvp for that quick near full hp insta heal? Could be life or death. Also i'd have improved healing with much less interuption possibilities.<br />
<br />
Balance-Shapeshift , natural weapons, Clarity, root- Seems like i'd do much more damage, root is a bonus and I still have about 6 extra points left for free use...also i'd get packleader which is also appealing.<br />
<br />
Feral-<br />
<br />
Feral instinct? I heard as a druid i'm not really expected to hold aggro...well then how bout the added stealth? I'm a night elf so do I need it? how useful is it really?<br />
Vs<br />
Thick Hide-It seems like a good overall choice but its blurred by how effective feral instinct is...overall this seems better tho.<br />
<br />
Feline swiftness-Is 4% dodge that great? I sure love the running speed. If cat form has better stats than cheetah, 30% sounds better than 40% in a pvp situation.<br />
<br />
Sharpened Claws- It must be decent...and only way to increase natural crits is good.<br />
<br />
Blood Frenzy, Primal Fury- Are these really that beneficial? Criticals are rare and to spend 4 points on a possibility seems kinda...random and unworth it...yet I dont have it so I dont know how good it is.<br />
<br />
Improved Shred-I doubt this is that useful cause you'll more than likely have little intervals between fights...once again I dont even have shred so (shrug)<br />
<br />
So I guess its feral benefits of balance vs resto feral benefits. but if I go balanced i'll have 5 extra points with this I could-<br />
<br />
Max out- Mark of wild, Furor, or Feral instinct. I hear mark of wild is really good, furror sounds good with rapid shape shifting...feral instinct...now that i think about it I dont really know so its less appealing. Oh yeah I can put 2 into thick hide and max it with 3 points left for any of above...<br />
<br />
Well help me out guys, what do u think =)<br />

<br />
You need good damage and a chance to run off. Running with your cat is good, if you fight outside you can confuse enemies with running around/behind or through them, especially casters they wont have alot chance to hit you.<br />
<br />
I use this build and I can always get out of combat when I'm in need of healing or have too much enemies approaching me.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=zzLVhoZxxMscrdtV<br />
<br />
The only difference is that I have an extra stealth instead of the stun and armor, I think those 10 procent don't do alot to save you, however stealth is good to sneak on the enemy or good to capture the flag in WSG if you assault the base.<br />
<br />
I  hope this helps you. Dont bother going balance if you haven't got raid equipment, its really hard to be a good balance druid with pre-raid equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railand</div><div class="date">06-29-2006, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The build your considering ( the 1st one posted) is the one I chose to grind / PVP until end game and possibly into end game.  <br />
<br />
The only differences are instead of 3/5 in Thick Hide, I put them in Feral Instinct because of the improvement to prowl and I do off-tank at times.  Additionally, I only have a point in each of Blood Frenzy and Primal Fury in order to put 2/2 in Improved Shred in order to give me the opp to throw a few more shreds while in instances and group muggings..:elfbiggri yet still gives me a chance to earn either rage or combo points on crits.  <br />
<br />
Finally, I put my 5 resto points in Furor, primarily because I like that idea of having 100% of the time rage and /or energy to get with things upon shapeshifting which I can do more liberally due to 3/3 in Natural Shapeshifting.  Right now, I only have 1 pt. in furor (only level 54 now), but noticed the difference between 5 pts and none when trying to &quot;prowl/tiger's fury/ravage&quot; someone for that 800 to 1000 pt. &quot;headstart&quot; and found I have to go into prowl alot further away in order to build up enough energy to throw the ravage on them.  Secondly, if needing a heal or getting pounded in regular cow form, having 5pts. in furor makes the option of dropping into dire bear more appealing because I now have the rage necessary to start Frenzied Regeneration and heal while AC is increased 360%.</div></div><hr />

Feral PvP (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druids/talents.html?0140050010000000500252131322215105000  0000000000)<br />
<br />
You really want Furor over IMotW for pvp.  The immediate 10 or 20 pts is REALLY nice, although you can pickup gear that will give you the same affect.  You're going to spend a lot of time in feral, and likely won't be shapeshifting all that often, as your AC and DPS is WAY better in feral form, which is why I don't see a need to waste TPs in NSS...JMHO<br />

Not to derail this too much... but this is one of the silly mis-conceptions of the wow player base.  Playing with a team, resto is an amazing build... and it's pretty solid one vs. one if you don't mind playing outlast... generally it's pretty easy to beat feral/balance druids as a resto.</div></div><hr />

Well we might have different PvP experience, I normaly just root somebody and heal my self instead of healing in mids of the battle.<br />
<br />
Resto can be nice too, I know quite some people who are resto and have feral gear and they still kick-ass.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all your help guys...I noticed i'm a pro at shredding- I shred rogues more than they backstab me. Makes me think even more that I woulda been a great rogue lol. Seems like a great build...I was about lvl 11 when I wrote that...a week ago... 29.8 or so now =)</div></div><hr />
