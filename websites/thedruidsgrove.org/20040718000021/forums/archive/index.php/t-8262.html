<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feyeith</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was back up healer for a LDoN group a couple of weeks ago.  The MH was a Cleric.<br />
<br />
I did what I normally do in most LDoN's when I am not the MH which is cast my clicky &quot;Tempest Wrath&quot;:  http://www.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=3602 ; and then cast Eci's and Winter's Frost.  After casting these, I generally Melee and may cast Winter's Frost again for the kill if needed.  And of course I patch heal as needed.<br />
<br />
I watch my casting in case the MH runs into trouble and I need to take over Healing in an emergency... I want a good amount of mana, just so I will be prepared.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I was yelled at by someone in the group because I was not sitting down and medding.  I was told that Druids do NOT melee.  And that the other members in the group were wondering what I was doing since I was not medding (later found this out to be a lie... when questioned later, no other participant in the group thought this)  Annnnnnyway.  My question is:<br />
<br />
If Druids have plenty of mana, do you think it is alright for them to melee?  Or should they sit and med during fights, regardless of mana.<br />
<br />
I was made to feel like a total noob because I thought that causing dmg with melee would help (every little bit helps) instead of sitting and doing nothing between nukes, buffs, heals etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildan</div><div class="date">06-14-2004, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I do not melee when I am in a DPS role. I either nuke or med for nukes.<br />
<br />
When I am in a healer role I tend to be much more mana conscious and try and hold back mana for heals. In that case I often melee. My hammer procs for some nice damage that can certainly contribute.<br />
<br />
Don't let anyone tell you what your role is. They can either except how you play a druid or chose not to have you in their groups. You don't need to fit into the template someone else has set forth for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see the same group complaining had you chain nuked and took aggro. <br />
<br />
I for one love melee. My weapon does nice damage, it procs more mana for me, and its great fun IMO. However, I wouldnt do it in a setting where things weren't easy (Vxed/Tipt/KT) and I certainly wouldnt do it on raids (ok sometimes if pulling trash) but in LDONS I play offtank and love it. <br />
<br />
So I say if you can handle doing multiple things - keep doing it. Its a game and you should do with it what you like (unless it affects anothers gametime as well - for instance melee when you have no mana and are no longer good to the group).</div></div><hr />
