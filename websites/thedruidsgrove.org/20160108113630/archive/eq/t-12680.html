You can kite in the graveyard area to the left of zone in.  I'm looking for a place to solo for exp at 70 myself.  Let me know if anyone knows of a good place.<br />

Drachnids and shadowmanes there are around 8% AA per kill at level 70 solo.  Not quite as good as the second castle in PoFire, but very relaxed exp, and with multiple spots to camp, rarely full.  Since it's an outdoors zone, you can save (regen) a bunch of mana by sitting on your horse while doing it.  Shadowmanes also can (rarely) drop hides, useful in the DoDH augment tradeskill quest, which sell for about 2kpp on my server.<br />
 <br />
You can also kill the orcs and the witherins around Stoneroot.  Not sure of the exp hit on those, never really paid attention.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
here's what you do:<br />
 <br />
snare one mob, swim away as fast as you possible can. get in range of the next mob and then stop swimming and wait 8 seconds to cast till you come to a complete stop. start casting snare on the next mob. the snare should land just as first mob catches up to you and the snare will get resisted.<br />
 <br />
try to snare the second mob again. when it finally lands, start swimming away to outrun the mobs. get stunned and beat down to 40%. start spamming heals on yourself as you get knocked back in water and hope that one lands. hit exodus just as you die so that when you die it activates just as you zone into your bind point and you load the zone twice. thank god for exodus.<br />
 <br />
get a rez and go try again. this time back up against a wall before you heal yourself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenielle</div><div class="date">11-21-2005, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh it is teh win.<br />
 <br />
I do have a slight advantage though, I have stun resist +4,357.  in all their wisdom the devs added stun resist as the main mod of all priest gear.  so my chance are 1 in 1,000,000 that i'll shake off the stun, as opposed to 1 in 1,000,001 for those without stun resist.<br />
 <br />
rumor has it we'll the devs are planning to give us channeling focus 2,598 like the caster mobs in water have.  it'll be so sweet to get knocked halfway across the zone and regain concentration.</div></div><hr />

Nest is nice exp as well, pull the mobs from across the bridge &amp; root/dot. Lots of HP but 14% AA exp @70.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might:<br />
<br />
charm in Broodlands<br />
kite or root rot in NC</div></div><hr />

Go to Plane of Justice, DC a rat and park him in the graveyard. Then pull the High Guardians of Justice there. Agro kite till your heart's content. <br />
<br />
Best exp in my opinion at lvl 63 non-flagged.</div></div><hr />
