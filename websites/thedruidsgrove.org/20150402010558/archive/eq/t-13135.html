They do, It's an innate class ability recieved at level 30.  It was added several years ago durring the first attempt to balance the kunark melee vs caster imbalance.  Especially sine Mages were doing more nuke damage with their bolt at 34 than a level 38 wizard.</div></div><hr />

1. 2% 2aa<br />

4. 9% 3aa<br />

10. 3aa (+5% to crit total)<br />
11. 6aa (+10% to crit total)<br />
12. 9aa (+15% to crit total)<br />

Seems a bit low. I'm at #7 right now I don't know if I want to spend 15 aa's to go from 14% to 16%<br />
 <br />
Eventually yes but not for awhile.<br />

<br />
For druids, we have <br />
SCF 3 (gets us to 7%)<br />
FOM 3 (gets us to 13%)<br />
FOMM3 (gets us to 19%)<br />
<br />
For wizards, you have the above, plus<br />
SCFM3 (which adds 7%)<br />
Advanced FOMM2 (I don't know what this adds, I'll assume 2% per level until someone shows me otherwise, so adds 4%)<br />
<br />
Let me know if I'm missing some other wizard AA re crits.<br />
<br />
Thus, druids have 19%, wizards have 32.3 to 32.5%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelfin</div><div class="date">01-19-2006, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">fwiw, i use the 16% in the spell calculator:<br />
var scf = document.getElementById(&quot;scf&quot;).value;<br />
switch(scf * 1) {<br />
	case 1 : scf = .02; break;<br />
	case 2 : scf = .04; break;<br />
	case 3 : scf = .07; break;<br />
	case 4 : scf = .09; break;<br />
	case 5 : scf = .11; break;<br />
	case 6 : scf = .13; break;<br />
	case 7 : scf = .14; break;<br />
	case 8 : scf = .15; break;<br />
	case 9 : scf = .16; break;<br />
	default : scf = 0;<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
then another 3% for power of the keepers/dark reign:<br />
var potkdr = document.getElementById(&quot;potkdr&quot;).checked ? .03 : 0;<br />
<br />
then calc the total against the mass balance:<br />
var totalCrits = Math.round(totalHits * (scf + potkdr));<br />
<br />
Scirocco, if you have a ref for the 19% i'd like to see it and i'll change my switch statement.<br />
<br />
also, when i researched that, i seem to remember i came across some info, like Teaenea mentioned, that wizards get the innate and it's around 1%. nothing amazing, just enough to give them the ability innately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">01-19-2006, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There has been nothing official on the innate rate.  One wizard parse I read reported it at around 2.3%.  I'd round down to 2%, since that seems to be the jump SOE is going for recent levels of crit AAs.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
lower than that, possibly at level one, I know at least level 10.  I have a newb wizzie at level 24 and over the levels he's had a number of crits, though they are rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember hearing the innate crit is like 3%.. other than that I **think** they get an extra set of crit increases from the class and dod (where we get improved dot crits) aa tables<br />
 <br />
For druids I got the same numbers as cass, except 4% instead of 3 for spell casting fury 2.  And yar lir's aa adds 3% I think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliathen</div><div class="date">02-07-2006, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wizard crit rate sits around 22-23%. That is including innates and DoN AA. Innate crits are kind of lame because they don't do the same damage as our AA crits. They are like 30-100% dmg increase random. And I believe they start at lv 10, though they were added long after I started playing.  Innate crits alone sit around 2-3%<br />
 <br />
In practice (parsing over 25,000 nukes) we only see about a 16-17% crit rate. Parses on non-resisting mobs are what show the real crit rate of ~22%.<br />
 <br />
And as for damage, I believe everyone else (mage, druid) are capped at 130% damage for crits where wizards get 150%. With druid 2.0 clicky and our DoDh proc spell (mana weave) active it's possible for a wizard casting Ether Flame to crit for 30k+. It's nearly impossible though. My personal best is 26k, and as was stated by lonwolf, one wizard in guild has hit 29k.<br />
 <br />
Finally, howdy all. Just reading your boards to get advice for my baby druid alt.</div></div><hr />

It only does like 50% more damage or something weird like that when the innate crit chance goes off.</div></div><hr />
