The Tunat or Kess bp would be much easier to get since I only have to go against other leather classes and they almost rot already in my guild or I could wait... and wait.. for the suedo rare (as I've heard) CoA BP.  The difference in HP and Mana aren't he greatest of concerns to me, I guess I'm really interested if the affects on the CoA BP are really that useful or not.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;<br />

You get ding'ed for picking up rot loot ? Plus who drops BPs more, OMM or AMV ? Unless you guys are farming both OMM and AMV heavily, might be quite a line if you wait for CoA BP or are you up for the next one that drops. <br />
<br />
For a druid it looks like Kess tunic would be better than Tunat. You've got the same focus as both those BP so the other stats such as avoidance and shielding seem nicer to have.</div></div><hr />

However, I must say it'ld be worth waiting out for anguish bp - because it's a BP you'll be able to use for a long time (DP bp sucks, and we dont get a new heal in PoR.) 25% pres on ancient is hard to beat.  However, the clicky on anguish bp isn't all that.<br />
 <br />
Since you have tacvi bracer and mpg boots the foci on the other bps are of no benefit for you, so imo they wouldnt be worth the dkp just to have a an extra 100 hp for a few months.</div></div><hr />

No, officer award, but its based on loot over XX days vs. RA.  Regardless of that basically if I get one BP then I'm not going to ask for another for quite awhile.  I'm leaning toward waiting for the CoA BP just trying to rationalize why. :)</div></div><hr />

If you're farming rikk / kess, tacvi and anguish, you also do / can do curse raids. But I doubt you're in Demiplane yet. If you ever want to replace it, you can just move the last blood augment to another piece of cultural armor.</div></div><hr />

Just from vauge bazaar prices, and a few poeple in the guild have done dodh augments.. it would run me rougly ~500k.  Unforunately, I'm a poor druid I've never been one to farm or camp stuff.  But I'll look it into it more closely thanks for the idea.</div></div><hr />

I have found they are willing to trade for some amount of the rarer drops that are used in making AAAA. You can solo / group all these drops easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">01-15-2006, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO if you want COA bp, be prepared to hoard dkp or to not claim any item if your guild is award based on items looted / attendance, because you'll be competing with just about anyone that might want the BP. It gets worse because AMV drops BP rarely as opposed to OMM, and if your guild doesn't have amv on farm status it might take a much more longer time.</div></div><hr />

i currently have tacvi BP and it serves me well :)</div></div><hr />

Assuming you have decent RA, I'ld say wait for CoA BP - why? it's going to be the best druid DP until the expansion after PoR at the minimum.  The only way it won't be the best bp til then is if a 25% bene pres foci is added in PoR, but that's highly unlikly for various reasons.  Also, I've found that silent casting and BP clicky are a nice combo when things aren't looking so good...</div></div><hr />

But alas i needed to upgrade it badly, and we didnt touch anguish for about 2 or 3 months.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't hording merit to get - actually was waiting for COA Arms to drop - which haven't dropped for us in 2+ months of constant COA clears (more wrists please! /sarcasm off).<br />
<br />
I must say it has been very nice. I am impressed with the mana savings rate when spamming ancient heals on raids. And the clicky spell haste is nice also. Makes Dawnstirke actually seem sorta fast :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the input guys.  <br />
 <br />
I think Nimchip kinda sums it up for me, I'll end up regreting it if I don't.  But in the mean time I'll take Winenose's advice and get the cultrual +aug for an upgrade and since the aug isn't really a BP and I can move it later when I get the CoA BP.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The guy that did the last combine for me grumbled and said I was lucky.<br />
 <br />
Grand total cost for me = 165k<br />
125K for the tinker box b/c there is just too much stuff to farm in that.<br />
30k for 1 glossy hide I was missing and too impatient to farm anymore creators for.<br />
 <br />
It would have cost me alot more but guild pep's contributed a few items I was missing ie. dreadspire gargoyle dust and the only combine I had to pay for was the GM woodelf.  I still have to go get him a scale for his services...</div></div><hr />
