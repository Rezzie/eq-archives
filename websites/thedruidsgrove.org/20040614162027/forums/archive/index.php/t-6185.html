<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mind you, the stuff I pulled out may not be available to druids.  Nor did I pull out all the AAs that druids are likely to have available.<br />
<br />
I just pulled out the ones that get Chenier excited....which is not a bad thing...:)</div></div><hr />

9282 Use of this ability creates a stationary ward that continually heals everyone around it. Increased ranks improve the healing capabilities of the ward.<br />
<br />
As there is a seperate one in the list for clerics.</div></div><hr />

Additional ranks increase the effectiveness further.One for Intense Hatred and the other for ... what?  I'm thinking Coat of Thistles which seems to have an out of place description.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pretty sure that ro's flaming familiar one (yeah that made me chuckle) is a wizard thing and not for us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Salacious_Corpse_01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok following the ideas of this...<br />
<br />
We have AoE wards, AoE attacks, strike through attacks, and lots of dmg shield aa's.<br />
<br />
I think that a lot of GoD encounters are going to be with linked mobs, that are immune to mez.  Sort of a 6 man group against 6 mobs at once deal.  Where dmg shields, and AoE heals are a big portion of the entire expansion, just my two CP though.</div></div><hr />

/agree...<br />
<br />
I'm most interested in Nature's Boon and the Endurance ward, along with Quick MGB/Curing. Oh, and Secondary Forte... Advance Tracking would be cool, but not that hot.<br />

I like this list.</div></div><hr />

EDIT: OK, Pet Affinity is OK, don't know what I was thinking. Seriously, Quickened Teleport though?  :rolleyes: And yeah, I admit Quick MGB would be overpowered for clerics and druids when combined with group heals, but still. It would be nice for stuff like Bot9. Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Only enchanters get Quick MGB.. would be too overpowering with druids, as it would allow us to MGB Spirit of the Wood sooner<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Faedia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">why would they give quick mass group buff to only enchanters....seems weird.<br />
<br />
Overpowered with Spirit of the Wood / Ethereal Elixir / Celestial Regeneration / Paragon of Spirit, I guess. But there are other buffing classes that could use it too.<br />
<br />
/shrug It could all change. I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Is it just me or do most of those AA ideas either a) suck, or b) come directly from ideas posted by players?<br />
<br />
That cleric mana-loh is going to be insanely overpowered, or like someone on EQCleric said, required for GoD raiding.  The latter idea scares me, putting an high powered ability on an already raid-critical class is only going to put more pressure on the cleric raid-grinder.<br />
<br />
Notice many classes get our healing-tree idea (posted over a year ago back at the old ezboard site.)  It's cool, could make some things trivial though.<br />
<br />
Hybrids getting mastery of the past and not full priests sucks.  Enough with the hybrid love... they arent supposed to be better than their parent classes at their jobs.<br />
<br />
Most of the classes seem to get pretty boring aa's with one good one or so.  That shared health for Mages will be really nice for them.    Monks did pretty well.  Necros will probably like crit dots.  Paladin ones kinda suck.  More archery love for Rangers, hard to say if it'll be any good.  Rogue ones seem dull, though Mug is kinda funny hehe...  lotta mixed bags there.<br />
<br />
Druid ones suck.  The double specialization thing will be nice, pretty much a required aa for all druids, but it's certainly not terribly exciting and will make only a marginal difference in actual practice.   Increased tracking skill cap?  Great... longer range tracking that I still cant sort.  Quickened curing...  should be more than 10% per rank... it'll wind up being like 12 aa's to knick off 48 seconds from RC...   and Quick Teleportation... seriously...  were they scraping the bottom of the idea barrel when they came up with that one?  That's terrible.<br />
<br />
I'll save some aa's for Secondary Forte and Healing Tree (or whatever - assuming it doesnt cause serious aggro or isnt nerfed in some way) but the rest of them wont make me go grind more XP that's for sure.  Hope the raiding content in GoD is good and plentiful or there's going to be a lot fewer players around in 6 months.</div></div><hr />

Heheh... so true.  Figure ~150ish AAs for each class.  That's nothing.  I expect to see maxed AAs again before the month's out.<br />
<br />
I've been sitting at maxed AAs, since May.  Didn't get a single point of exp on any LDON adventure and that charm already completed.<br />

Ya i think they where smokin dope when they came up with the shortend ports.  Increase dammage would be hard core for our DS's. The porcuipine method on killing stuff would be increased greatly.

<br />
We haven't seen the GoD spell lineup. I wouldn't say we get &quot;nothing&quot; just yet. It's possible there's an upgrade to Mask of the Forest somewhere in there. (Although personally, I doubt GoD spells will be spectacular upgrades to anything unless there is a level increase, so you're probably right!)<br />
<br />
These new AAs will probably get me wanting to get XP again. Right now there aren't any AAs I don't have that make me want to actually grind for them. I'd rather just pick up stuff grouping casually with friends or something. Almost everything on that new list is something I'd want - Nature's Boon and Secondary Forte right off the bat. The only ones I don't want are the &quot;we couldn't think of anything else, so why not&quot; AAs like Improved Innate Lung Capacity and Quickened Teleport. <br />

QT annoys me actually. Nobody should have to spend points on that. &quot;Hey guys, Circle of the Nexus is 3% faster! And it only took me 3 AA points!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes us the only class that doesn't get a unique AA ability.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, sorry, we can buff pets now with our group spells -- excuse me while I go jump for joy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Feldaran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Sony still has this misguided view of &quot;versatility&quot; meaning something to groups.<br />
<br />
Tower of Sol Ro semi-requires a druid or wizard, that's about it. <br />
<br />
So we get all these lame AA's trying to be versatile.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and other classes get the pet buff AA as well, so that's not unique to druids.<br />
<br />
Druids get quick teleports, healing tree, crit dot's, better crit nukes, better tracking...<br />
<br />
Clerics get mana infusion thing, a chance to be rezzed AA (or something), an attack buff thing, healing tree...<br />
<br />
I'll take mana infusion thing over most of what we get. I rarely go oom, but it'd be useful after a rez. Certainly, its more useful than quick teleports.... What sadistic sony employee thinks people actually want stuff like that?</div></div><hr />

Everything is 3-6-9-12-15, 4-8-12-16, 5-10-15-20, etc. Almost everything is 3-5 ranks too. Going to be along time before anyone maxes out there GoD column, heard you will need to spend something like 300-325 aap to max it out. Not that anyone is going to be rushing out to buy most of these...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;problem&quot; I guess is there are players (I can think of 3 im my guild alone) who would think nothing of grinding out 20 AA in little more than a weekend, whereas I probably add 2 or 3 AA a week.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tilien Venator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I heard on chat today that Critical Affliction 1 is like only 2% dmg added. They said it effects every spell, but 45 aap for a 10%? inccrease seems pricey. Even for those of us who can grind out multiple aap a day, 45 will take awhile. They've killed off most of the good solo exploitable grinds anyways.</div></div><hr />

Wow, those AAs are too cheap.  Considering PoP gives you an AA every 30-60 minutes (depending on group composition and strength), the powergamers will max out GoD in a week.  Many (like me) already have 30 AAs banked and doing nothing, and we'll get most of the good AAs within 10 seconds of logging in.  They either need to make some more useful AAs, or increase the cost of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I certainly wouldnt say Many are fully aa'd lol...  people on the mb's are in a very small minority when it comes to things like that.  The huge majority of people are not even close to being max aa'd.  And you dont need to balance the price of them based on people who get an aa every 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Fact is, if advancement is not attainable in a timely manner for the average player, then the game loses it's appeal as the carrot is too far away.<br />
<br />
Who cares if the powergamers max in a week?  It makes no difference to 99% of the population.  For everyone else the costs of these are very high for the benefit they provide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Aly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Too high in my opinion.  I wish I could find a game that was balanced around the casual gamer and not the power gamers, but so far, every game I've tried has been the other way around.  Even some of the more popular Neverwinter Nights PW servers.  It's all about slowing xp gain down to try and create longevity.  I don't understand how it works.  How can people have fun grinding out aaxp on the same mobs, day in, day out?!  I'd rather see a variety of places and creatures instead of grinding out xp in the same area.<br />
<br />
FFXI has that problem too.  Grind, grind, grind.  SWG is even worse now.  Everyone knows how to get 4/5th's the way to a force sensitive character slot once they get four holocrons.  There's no RP value to the grind needed for a FSCS.  There's no RP value for these games whatsoever.  It's just grind, grind, grind... and thousands upon thousands of people do it every day.<br />
<br />
EQ and every other MMOG I have played... they all cater to grinding and powergaming.  At least FFXI has fun quests.<br />

<br />
The carrot has long been too far away.  Ever since the release of PoP.  I came back a couple days ago just to kill some time while I wait for something better to come out.  That and to test my new RAM. ^.^~  I just wish I could get into betas so I'd have something fun to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Fayne Dethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I wouldnt consider those cheap at all.   The majority of players do not have elemental access nor do they have the gear to do Hard LDON in a timely manner.   Also, take into account that Sony destroyed charm soloing, most people wont be maxing out all these AAs all that fast.    In the last few months I've only gotten like 20-30 AAs or so cause LDON gets boring so fast (only got 2 augments, lol) and so does mindlessly pulling in earth.   I doubt I will be maxing these AAs anytime soon, especially not quickened teleportation, pet affinity, lung speed, packrat, or quickened curing...</div></div><hr />

I think it's 324aap to max out your GoD Column. There are not very many 20 min aap grinds left. I find that I usually only get about 1 an hour or so. That's including real time too. While I'm not your average druid, being time geared and having over 400 aap, spending 45 aap on one skill that doesn't really give me that much of a improvement seems wasteful. I can't imagine how a more casual druid must see things</div></div><hr />

I'll give you a hint.  When that warm and toasty place way down below in metaphysical terms freezes over... that's when most casual druids will buy those AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Raloda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Some are priced ok I think.. Others are way off.. Who is going to pay 20 points for pet buffing? I guess to me thats about as good as Quick teleport.. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Greggo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Pet buffing would have its uses no question about that, buts its not worth 20 AA.  It IS worth about a million times as much as Quick teleport...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Raloda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Well my main point is 20 points? to buff how many pets? My understanding of it it would buff pets of those in your group. Now if you have 5 other pet classes it may be worth it to get. Normaly I have 1 pet class in my group. 20 aa points to buff 1 pet? Sorry Not for me thanks.. <br />
<br />
I guess on raids it may be worth it for mgb buffing or sotw/cr. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Autumn10</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">I have to admit that some of those costs really suck for casual gamers. Especially given the fact that so many of them are mediocre at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>sera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">There's nothing wrong with having high costs for aa, I don't mind it if the AA's are useful and exciting, this stuff is awful.<br />
<br />
Hell I'd pay 100 AA just for Karana's Renewal to crit.  Or for spell casting subtlety.  And with the increase in HP's warriors will get with their AA in GoD, and full time gear, our heals will be less and less effective.  Some continuation of Healing Adept would really help, and I would be happy to do the xp for it.<br />
<br />
However I think the pet buffing AA needs to be adjusted per class.  20 AA for bards to be able to have their songs effect pets is massive.  For us, it's a huge inconvience.  I mean whoopie, for 20 points I get to be able to cast 9 on pets or like regen and seasons.<br />
<br />
If anyone at sony has a clue and are reading this, YES we will pay through the nose for AA but at least make the costly ones worth the time we xp grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>princess0fdiabl0</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">no... give the AA's to the mages necros and beastlords.<br />
<br />
there is no reason the buffing classes should be &quot;punished&quot; in order to buff someone elses pet, who we usually dont even care about</div></div><hr />
