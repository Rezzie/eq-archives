- A new graphics optimization has been added to EverQuest to improve framerate performance so that gameplay is more enjoyable. Auto Portal Volume Optimization has been implemented in the vicinity of objects which contain large numbers of inner objects. In some cases we have tested the optimization and have seen a 15 percent gain in frame rate.<br />
You can toggle apv optimizations off and on with the slash command, &quot;/apvoptimizations.&quot; When EverQuest is loaded it checks for an &quot;APVOptimizations&quot; key value pair specified in the eqclient.ini and turns portalizing off or on depending on this value. If a value does not exist in this file it gets set to on by default and written to the eqclient.ini file. Once changes are made to the state of the apv optimizations, the eqclient.ini file will be updated accordingly. <br />
- A certain time between two /say commands is not required anymore. Good people don't spam.<br />
 <br />
*** Future Tradeskill Changes ***<br />
We will be making a change to the cultural armor that will nullify the usage of all existing drops in the cultural armor and symbol crafting process. For the slot 12 raid augments, only the drops for the seals will be changing, the rest of the drops required for the various steps of the slot 12 raid augments will be staying the same. Those of you who have stockpiles will want to make use of them as best and quickly as possible, as once the changes go in, the currently existing cultural recipes will no longer work. This change will even out the disparity of drop rates between different races and remove the extreme rarity of some items.<br />
For more detailed information please see the &quot;Upcoming Cultural Changes&quot; sticky thread in the Artisans Way forum of the official EverQuest forums.<br />

 <br />
I've always loved Fernspur and I use it both soloing and in groups on tank. It is after all, unresistable damage! And now that the cast time is so short, it's instacast, unresistable spell. I think those make it extremely powerful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Powdwar</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a little more investigating and it looks like the names on our AA heals have been adjusted.  Also appears that bear pet AA names have been changed.  And the demiplane class item should now reference Reptile (not Serpent) in focus effect and description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe, wonder if they finally made the icefall bear white too<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% but think the pristmatic resist on WF might be moot btw.. don't have access to a spelldat parser but offhand how I read that is;<br />
<br />
before if the fire nuke which procs the cold nuke gets resisted the cold nuke doesn't go... so they fixed it so they changed it so you first cast  Winter's Flame Resist as a resist check that's designed not to fail at all and that procs both the fire and cold.  I could easily be wrong but that would fix the problem and cause those 2 to fire independantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing I'm curious about though, if the new nuke is both nuke and dot how does extra spell haste (from quick dmg or afflicition haste VI) work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabrielle</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Fernspur whenever possible however at times I have had trouble getting it tossed in during fights if I'm main healer, so the instacast will certainly help.  Plus if healing, it gives a little dps to add to the fray.<br />
As for the new dot, if this IS accurate then kudos to SOE.  Its been a bit depressing that I cant solo like I used to, and im looking forward to taking on some solo time when the mood strikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nduma</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the Fernspur change to insta-cast, to me it gives us the flexibility that shaman get with String, cast a offensive type spell then get back to other things almost immediately. Only draw back still is in 1 tank situations, multiple druids can't stack it.<br />
<br />
That new DD/dot spell looks rather nice but, with the mana cost, looks like one to try use on a GoRM proc.<br />
<br />
http://www.antonius-bayle.org/kumbaja/spells/spell_view.php - looks like Kumbaja is ahead of Lucy.<br />
<br />
Skin to Vines is also as someone said 0.5 second cast<br />
<br />
Edit: the new Blazzing Wrath cast time is 3 seconds - which is pretty nifty as well - with spell haste should be able to get it to about 2 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laurelleii</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a nice spell but ouch on the mana cost :eek:<br />
<br />
I use Fernspur constantly, I love it. Being insta cast now just makes it that much sweeter.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 <br />
DD portion has yet to crit and has yet to be effected by epic 2<br />

my finding so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">04-18-2007, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went and tested Nature's Blazing Wrath. Spell seems very nice and definately lands more often than Equinox Burn. But something seems off... altough DoT part was critting nicely, I didn't manage to get a single crit with the nuke part. Plus the base damage was lower than I expected, with Anguish fire focus it was pretty much same what I get with EB. So before I get rank2 spell, not sure how much I'll use this spell since the mana cost is huge. And epic 2.0 clicky didn't seem to have any effect on it either...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What makes it a DoT with a DD in it and not vice-versa ? Not disagreeing with your statement - trying to figure out why. May explain why no crits are being seen either but, that hardly seems intentional if the DD can't crit on cast.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If the dot side of it crits then the DD side should regardless if any one thinks our epic should effect it... which think it should... or its simply to much mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it has a duration.  DDs are instant cast and don't have duration values.<br />
<br />
The spell is basically a Druid verison of http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=436&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Think of it like our lower level roots.  They don't critical either, and they have a DD componant, but are not DDs.</div></div><hr />

Small clarification on the changes to Winter's Flame and Summer's Dew: the initial spell is unresistable and the ice / fire nukes' resist checks are called independently of each other.<br />

I tuned NBW to do exactly as much damage as it does currently.  If the DD portion were to crit, the damage on the spell would have to be lower to compensate for that change.</div></div><hr />

However, the spell is inefficient as well, so you need to be careful when and how often you use it.  The spell is aimed at giving druids a unique high damage / low efficiency damage tool.</div></div><hr />

If you get 9k out of it, given max dot crit action, you're likely to be just as well off casting EB/WF and hoping for a decent crit.<br />

<br />
http://samanna.net/sham.info/demystified.shtml<br />
<br />
Going by the aa values on that samanna link above, with full aa, crit frequency is 35% and the crit mod is 2.45 (or 1.45 depending on how you look at it) ... If you crit for base * 2.45 35% of the time I believe the avg nuke before foci comes out to about base * 1.5075.  The amount added by foci is then added on top of that iirc.  So average dmg should = base * 1.5075 + (base * (foci/2)/100)<br />
<br />
Omit the 2nd part if you want to omit the effects of foci.  But basically for full aa and pretty sure I included the don aa when I crunched those numbers (I just copy pasted that from a tbs beta post) you just take base dmg x 1.5075</div></div><hr />

<br />
NBW:  <br />
<br />
5440 Damage Base verus 2752 for EB (NBW wins at 51% more damage)<br />
<br />
989.09 DPS (cast time + recycle = 5.5 seconds)<br />
259.04 DPS (Cast time + Run Time = 21 Seconds)<br />
<br />
314.51 DPS (EB Cast time + Recycle = 8.75 seconds) NBW wins in direct compairson by 317% or so, it loses in duration compaison, as may be expected from comparing a DoT to a Instant Duration Nuke by 14%.<br />
<br />
Max Critical (No Focus):<br />
<br />
NBW:  7825 (14% more damage this is due to the DD part )<br />
EB:  6742 (After VM3)<br />
<br />
Fire focus effects all aspcets of NBW, so it should wash out.<br />
<br />
If only one tick of NBW criticals, it comes in at 6235, which is 8% less damage then a EB Critical. So even 2 of 3 ticks critical, you see an damage increase over EB.<br />
<br />
No matter how you look at it tho, NBW is a high mana cost DPS tool, and has an innate -10 check on it.  I think it will fill the roll it was created for fairly well.<br />

I am a conservative druid but these two definately eat up your mana ......however if you use it when you have GoRM it is awesome. (11.3km buffed)<br />
 <br />
I have 35% to fire and saw a few 2k dot crits and 3700 on the spell itself (might have been some 3800-3900)<br />
 <br />
fenspur procced 5 times in the 1.5 hours (not constantly cast but real close to it ....since didnt cast when mobs were low and running).<br />
 <br />
I love the unlinked aa's since when we have 2+ on inc takes bit for chanter to lock down so shammy takes beating and this helps nicely.<br />

With the refunds and my saved I was able to pick up 2 ranks of the ancient grove......very happy with this.</div></div><hr />

I proc GoRM a decent amount, and using it on Wrath makes a big, very noticeable increase in my DPS. In groups of the same friends I normally have doing Anguish aug runs, Efreeti in Atiiki, and kiting bears in icefall everyone was commenting on the quicker mob deaths. In Anguish or anywhere with a raid timer it's a definate GoRM spell, the mana cost isn't worth it unless you really need to burn down a mob. Soloing it's great for burst dps and with rest isn't that big of a deal to use.<br />
 <br />
The cast time is great, I've been able to cast in between heals just fine. It's also very easy to slip in when dpsing, between nukes and/or fast dots. With my focus and spell haste it's down to 2.4 seconds. I think my biggest + on this is the cast time. Getting in Equinox Burn or Winter's Flame usually doesn't happen when I'm main healer, and everyone knows a lot of the time mobs don't last long enough to use sunscorch. Nature's Burning Wrath has yet to last longer than the mob is alive. I'm very happy with it.</div></div><hr />

Rashere is changing dot aggro damage....which is good I grabbed aggro quite a few times last night casting this....where as normally its a group heal on 2+ mobs inc or our new toy spell that debuffs them also that grabs aggro (not counting the 32k crits because they are low enough this kills them)</div></div><hr />

Summer's Dew has a 0 hp heal component on it so that it will be eligible for GoM.  Due to some oddities with how exceptional heals work, 0 hp is a valid heal amount and you &quot;crit heal&quot; for 1 occasionally.  It's not actually doing anything, but you do get the message.  We have to rework the crit heal code a bit to clear this up, but couldn't get it in for the patch and figured you'd rather get the occasional odd heal message than have the spells not work with GoM.<br />

So it is a &quot;no brainer&quot; to toss out a NBW when you get a Gift of Radiant Mana and are nuking.  At a 10% GoRM chance, and 1 qualifying spell every 6 seconds, that gives you 1 (EB III) changed to a (NBW II) every minute, which works out to a 55 mana-free DPS boost for Druids.  Plus the NBW takes less time to cast.</div></div><hr />
