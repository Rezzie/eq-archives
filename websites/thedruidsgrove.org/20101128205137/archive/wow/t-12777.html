Mind you I'm not in the beta, so all I have to go on is how it looks on paper. Tiger's Fury is a ability with a 1s CD on it, doesn't affect the GCD of our other abilities, and can be used while stealthed. With King of the Jungle, each time it is used, we gain 30 energy (60 minus the cost). Essentially we would now have an ability that we can spam at anytime that increases our energy regeneration by 30/s. Is this right? Does this mean the death/reduced effectiveness of power shifting?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And max rank will be +131 damage at 79 which is nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish they would stop nerfing us and give us good DPS over time and not just burst damage.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

Thanks<br />

So it does sort of balance out a bit :&gt;<br />
<br />
If you study the technique, lay out your gear/stats well, and maximise your contact time, you should be able to pull quite respectable sustained raid dps.  There is a writeup I did about raid dps rotations that may help you with this, take a look at this post (http://wow.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showpost.php?p=149021&amp;postcount=3) and look for the section about 2 thirds of the way down the page about Cat Form.  :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">08-15-2008, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The annoying part is that Blizz made it so that Druids are very strong, maybe even OP early on leveling (i still remember solo'ing a shadow priest and a warrior at the same time in Zangarmarsh when we were all 65), and at 70 but once rogues / warriors start getting their 'endgame' weapons we can't keep up cause our AP just doesn't scale the same. Though, from a pure dmg perspective, a hybrid class probably shouldn't do the same or outdmg the parent class i suppose, otherwise what's the point of even having the parent. That said, ferals / boomkins do tons of dmg, and from what I've heard are amazingly strong in wotlk, and will be a vital part of raids.<br />
 <br />
Same thing actually is going on with warlocks - affliction is really strong while leveling and gearing up, but it is just plain outscaled by desctruction at t5+ levels, and with the way that the new wotlk talents are looking, and coefficients are set, the same thing is going to happen.<br />
 <br />
Long story short - despite good work and a lot of effort, blizz can't get away from 'pigeon-holeing' classes cause balance is so skewed right now with the ridonkulous gear they have in the game.<br />

Moonkins will be the number 1 most desirable type of druid to have in a 25 man raid in WotLK.<br />

yep.<br />

Maybe. But then people will point out &quot;BUT THEY CAN HEALZ 2&quot; and then they'll be nerfed into uselessness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">08-18-2008, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...or Blizzard GM's might produce another awesome ascii art of a cow druid going &quot;Moo!&quot;, and tell everyone (once again) &quot;druids are fine, l2p&quot;  :&gt;<br />
<br />
I think (just a guess..) that Blizzard are actually very fond of druids.  I think that they will be nice to us.  :&gt;<br />
