I've been browsing around and I found someone refering to a leadership AA that pops up a window showing your target's target? I am now thinking of getting that AA first as it would immensely simplify the job of assist healing! Now if only I know the name of that AA...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I Totally disagree with you on this one.  While Health of Target's Target is very useful and I highly suggest getting this (raid leader ability for this is great) even though it is very confusing to have two health bars sometimes... Inspect Buffs is a waste of points until later on.  How often will you inspect someone else to find out what buffs they are missing?   The answer for me would be never.  The second someones buff starts blinking, they will ask you for it.  You should never need this ability.<br />
<br />
My favorite Grp Leader AA at the moment is 'Spell Awareness'.  This will show everyone in the group the name of the spell being casted.  If it's an AA ability it will show you which level the person has also (i.e. PlayerA begins to cast [cure2].  cure2 being radiant cure level 2, forgot the actual name it lists), which is not only helpful for assist healing, but also can allow you to laugh at the other person for slacking on AA's! :P<br />
<br />
Health Enhancement is great as always.  I love having hp's.  The more you can have the better in my opinion.  Seeing 8100 instead of 8010 is much better to me :)<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - Helps out enchanter's more than anyone else, but it is useful at times and definately looks pretty sweet... Not something I would ever think of grabbing first, but eventually. ;)<br />
<br />
Delegate Mark NPC - Helps enchanter's or CC get a better idea of what they should mez/CC.  Thats pretty much the biggest use I can think of for this.  You can let someone else mark NPC's with a seperate target ring.  Worth getting?  Maybe...<br />
<br />
To sum it up... Spell Awareness and Health of Target's Target are definately worth buying.  Delegate Main Assist is very useful but I wouldn't toss out the /assist hotkey for it. Delegate Mark NPC is more useful in a raid environment where you will be pulling multiple mobs that are high dps. Any &quot;Enhancement&quot; ability is adequate to get eventually just on the principle of it adds to your stats (atk, hp, etc) but I wouldn't start dropping points in this area until I had SA and HoTT.<br />
<br />
&quot;Target of Target, I have a question where does it display this information? Nominated Assist and NPC health add % health of mob on the end of its name is it the same as that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You get a seperate health bar that you have a button to toggle it with like an AA ability.  You click the leadership window and select the ability and Hotkey it.  You click the hotkey button and a new Target window opens up you can place anywhere on the screen.  Once you select something (pc or npc) it will show what they have targeted.  If you have an NPC selected it will show who it is hitting.  This is great for assist healing because it auto-updates and will allow you to see which target it is switching to the very instance it does it.  You then can /assist off that mob and get the heals flowing.  This is completely different than NPC health etc.<br />

Well I enjoy the ability and can watch to make sure people are awake on healing and can fill in where necessary.  If I see four cleric quick heals going I wont necessary have to worry about tossing in a sylvan infusion.  Also can see if snare is casted and any other spell.  I'm not just talking group but the raid environment also.  It is about as useful as any other GoD ability, nothing that I wouldn't mind if it was never implemented.<br />

<br />
1.  Health of Target's Target = extremely useful in raids, especially when blast healing and knowing the boss mob's health for add spawn timings.  Getting used to this new window, though, is distracting at best.   The downside is that it is expensive<br />
<br />
2.  Offense enhancement = helping melee with higher attack is a good thing.  But the cost progression is 4,5 ? ? ? <br />
<br />
3. Spell awareness = have seen this only a couple of times, but it is useful. <br />
<br />
4.  HP's and mana pool =  all right, but they really don't matter that much for groups or raids.  Regeneration is an unknown for me<br />
<br />
5.  All others, they are either gimmicks or a nuisance.</div></div><hr />

HoTT is definately the best.  Designate MA is decent and convenient.  inspect buffs I dont like, but I can see the usefullness...if communication is low or people just dont like to talk.</div></div><hr />

It's worth it when you figure out your MT keeps getting owned by random mobs because they haste themselves or nearby mobs are hasting them.  It's also funny to see mobs in KT trials cast protection of the cabbage on themselves. :rolleyes:<br />

Anyway it does seem actually seem a bit buggy and rubbish. If you're in a raid you need 18 people in the raid for it to work, even if you're using the group leader AA. This prevented my from using it the one time it would have been really really useful, naturally. I also need to find out how to turn the damn thing off once it's started /sigh.</div></div><hr />

Question, does Spell Awareness work with AEs? <br />
<br />
Question2, how much regen is associated with Health Regen? 1/tick per level? more?<br />
<br />
I dont plan on doing the HP ones yet. I would rather go Offense, since it's virtually always useful, compared to HP which is not always. But since the Offense cost rises, I will prolly work both with an emphasis on Offense. Depends on health regen, too. If it's 3/tick regen per level, it's not bad...<br />

Sometimes you can start your heal before your target even knows they're about to get hit :)  This is because mobs can change targets between strikes (several times). It's also good to know how well your tanks are holding agro. I've watched alot of fights where the mob switches momentarily to several people other than MT but haven't had time to hit them before switching back. If a mob 'glances' at you, you know it's time to take a nuke break. Get Hott first.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just got spell awareness, basically it appends the name of the spell being cast to the normal spell message i.e. instead of 'Soandso begins to cast a spell.' you'll see 'Soandso begins to cast a spell. (Winters Frost)'. Doesn't add any more spam unless that means your text is gonna start wrapping around the window. Limited use but again, it's nice to know exactly what people and mobs are doing sometimes. e.g. spot annoying spell casts of heals, dispells and slows by mobs so you can try to stun them. Maybe your raid hits the dot limit on a mob and you notice one of the chanters casting a dot=p Spot someone casting a buff you want at a guild raid and ask them for it rather than someone who may not have it memmed... little things. <br />
The trouble is you have to read all the spell cast info to benefit from SA which is basically a pain in the ass to do all the time. Get this if you think you'd benefit from reading more information about your surroundings alot of the time, otherwise go for hitpoints after hott.</div></div><hr />
