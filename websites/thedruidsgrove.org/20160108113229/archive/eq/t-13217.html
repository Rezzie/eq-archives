 <br />
Due to my play hours, and the fact most of my guild are all lvl 70s and doing DOD content i cannot do, i mostly solo. I have all the exspansions, but have rarely set foot in any zone from OOW and on....<br />
 <br />
Where would be good places for me to solo?? I dried up the Stalker camp in PON, the exp sucks now but still get good AAs from it. I just came back from a break from EQ and went from 58-62, hence why i havent been to any newer zones yet, still kind of living back in the old zones i used to play in. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. <br />
If its any help i have so so bazaar gear, around 5k mana pool, and FT3 in items. I do have my epic and one other clicky DOT item. <br />
 <br />
Thanks much :texla:</div></div><hr />

Anyone have suggestions regarding soloing at 70? I only have 1 account so therefore 2 or 3 boxing is not available.<br />

I have all expansions, so-so gear (no time gear) around 7k HP buffed and 7k mana pool. Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem with groups, but that's due to my work schedule, and the fact that I rarely do P.U. groups. If a guildie or friends aren't around, I just go solo for a bit. DoD has some decent solo camps, if you know where to look.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Seriously tho, go do some monster missions so you can group with your guildies. Nobody thinks of you less. I remember my own starting days when most of the guild was off in BoT or PoV and I was stuck kiting wyverns in CS at around lvl 50, trying to catch up - not a good feeling. Had there been monster missions back then, I would've done them. I had eneough sense to work up my casting skills and defensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with the zone currently flagged as a hotspot (until next patch, approx 2 more weeks) it may be worth your time to check it out.<br />
<br />
of course, there's the good ol, PoS frogs.  You could also crank out some of the MM's in HPH for decent exp also.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you root/rot, try to get affliction efficiency item or use tribute.  it makes a nice difference!</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoN: the gargoyles in the far SE corner of the zone.  They are all 57, so you get full bonus XP for all of them.  About 13k HPs.<br />
<br />
PoS: the frogs, all level 60, about 17K HPs.<br />
<br />
HoH: suits: all level 61, about 25K HPs.  Human guards, all level 62, about 24K HPs.<br />
<br />
NC:  Murks are 60-62ish, about 26K HPs.<br />
<br />
These spots are all nice, easy, reasonably fast XP, and doable with even quite a gimp kit.  Trust me, I know ;)<br />
