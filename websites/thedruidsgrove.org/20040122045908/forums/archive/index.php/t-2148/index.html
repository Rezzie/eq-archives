<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jocund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Twelve of my guild (avg. level 62) went after the yellow to 65 cons in the basement of the building in the SW corner of HoH.  We went down the stairs and across the room to back wall.<br />
<br />
We managed to kill two Rabid Wurlons but it was ugly and slow.  We just could not seem to come up with a tactic that let us not get the mana sucked completely out of our casters while at the same time allowing them to get in any heals/nukes.<br />
<br />
Then we tried a Recurso thinking he would be easier and were wiped quick and in a hurry.<br />
<br />
Any tactical suggestions will be greatly appricated!  I would love to be able to hunt here for runes and molds/patterns but I will have a really hard time convincing folks to go back! 8(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jarilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The one time I did this it was in a group that had two 65 enchanters, both with the high level charm spell.  I would harmony so that we pulled the Wrulon single and sic both pets (Guard or Guardian ) on them.  We had a melee near the fight calling the AE's and the rest of us waited a ways off out of the AE range.  When the AE was called, those that could would run in and nuke, dot, heal, etc.  It was quite an effort just to kill one mob but it worked.  We used the same tactic for the Recurso (sp?).  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
