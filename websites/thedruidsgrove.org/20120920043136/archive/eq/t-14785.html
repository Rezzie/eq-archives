I can't find any info anywhere about this happening to anyone else.  I checked all over druids grove and soe forums and no luck.  Did something change?<br />
 <br />
This has happened to me everywhere in groups and in raids.  Happened in anguish, vish fight, in devastation, relic, everywhere.  No warning, it just goes poof.<br />
 <br />
I can't figure out what's going on here.  I NEVER had this happen before.  Anyone know what's going on?</div></div><hr />

Alot of times without having a bard in group and its actually never happened to me in Direwind.  I've been paying close attention lately trying to figure it out.<br />
 <br />
At first it seemed like it only happened when someone in my group was rezzed back in zone which makes no sense at all.  Then I noticed I had a pally in my group evertme this happened.  Not sure what they could've done though.  That might have just been coincidence.<br />
 <br />
Had a theory for a bit that maybe it was when my famiar died or my aura dropped but that doesn't seem to be the case either.  Still trying to track down the cause of this problem.<br />
 <br />
It doesn't happen very often though so hard to tell.  But when it does happen it seems to happen repeatedly and usually only to one or two people in the group.  Usually casters.  So my current working theory is that it may have something to do with some buff that melee have blocked but casters have not.<br />
 <br />
It's incredibly annoying.  Need to figure out what's causing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">11-15-2006, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only for the past two days?  Wow, lucky you.  Its been happening to me since TSS was released, probably has occurred 30 times for me thus far.<br />
<br />
Latest event:   Me solo, not part of any group, raid, expedition, etc.   Gated into Guild Lobby from MPG.  Cast FoE in lobby (I never use SoE).   Zoned into guild hall.  FoE drops as I approach the hot tub, the buff lasted about 45 seconds.  I shout obscenity.  I type obscenities into guild druid channel.  I cast FoE on myself again.  Within 2 minutes FoE drops again.  More obscenities follow.   Every druid in my guild experiences this bug.<br />
<br />
I'd be thrilled to see this thing fixed.<br />
<br />
Until then, I'll continue to blame most every death I experience (regardless of reason) on losing Eagles and falling for 200k.   I'm certain the GMs will grow weary of giving me 100% CS rezzes on a daily basis   :)</div></div><hr />

Again this is happening to me and I have a Pally in my group again.  Has not happened to me in awhile and this is the first time I've been grouped with a pally in awhile.  I am convinced now it has something to do with paladins.  I will try and figure this out after our raid.</div></div><hr />

The only logical explanation for a paladin making soe fade would be group heal since they dont really have anything that affects the group, possibly their aura?  I wouldn't know seeing as I group with paladins alot and this doesnt happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamdaru</div><div class="date">11-24-2006, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is not paladins with me either, I have experienced this in the guild hall also, and the message is FOE fades.  I am not clicking off buffs, i am simply waiting for raids to be called and it drops ...... I am not grouped, no auras going (just did start reusing mine).  It has also happened to me once or twice in direwind when the expansion first came out.  It has been a couple weeks, but it IS still happening every once in awhile to the druids in my guild also.</div></div><hr />

FOE hasn't mysteriously dropped for me in a month or two, but I'd like to be prepared in case it starts happening to me again.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes it fades after a couple seconds, sometimes it fades after a couple mins, but it never got remotely close to lasting the full 1hour duration, even tho buff timers don't even deplete there.</div></div><hr />
