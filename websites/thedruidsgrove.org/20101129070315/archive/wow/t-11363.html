I certainly do.. I always thought the biggest problem against shamans was damage in bear.. and now when that has been worked out, they are freakin easy as hell...<br />

Was defending Lumber Mill alone in AB yesterday... 2 Shamans against little kittie Brekster....<br />

and guess what.. I was stearing down at two fallen shamans....<br />
