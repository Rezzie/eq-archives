<br />
I recall in a patch message or Dev Corner post that Harmony was overpowered for a low level spell and so on, and was later replaced by HoN.  The main difference being single-target vs. AoE and lower duration (?).  I tried a search but something must have been wrong with my search string as I got many posts that had nothing to do with Harmony.<br />
<br />
The reason why I am wondering about this now is, if Harmony still has no resist check, but Harmony of Nature has a Magic Resist -10 check, why again is it that HoN is better...?  Is it because of the level of the spell vs. the level of the mob thing, that came about with the resists revamp?<br />
<br />
Apologies in advance for bringing up an old topic.</div></div><hr />

and look at the line: Frenzy Radius(15/65)<br />
<br />
the 65 is the level limit.<br />
