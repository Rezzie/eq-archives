<br />
Instance the best to me . Your questions is &quot; Can you kill there with lvl 34 or are you weak to go there &quot; . First it deppends of your items but my advice is &quot; Don't go there alone &quot; . <br />
There are alot of strong creatures but items are exelent :<br />

Oh and for note, don't let any of them run from you, you don't want them bringing 3 or 4 of their buddies.</div></div><hr />

When in the Cath DO NOT attack the boss until you have cleared the entire Cathedral if you don't wait than he aggros the entire place for you. Great fun :)</div></div><hr />

On a side not. If you are not at honored with darnassus yet there are also some quests there in the stone talon mountains that will help get you there for a discount on you mount at 40 :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's another questions I had....is honor really that important during the game?  I didn't know that the more honored you were the bigger the discount on the mount.  I did hear that some places like the Ardent Orange or whatever it is allow you to get sweet sweet end-game armor pieces, etc.....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">05-19-2006, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reputation with certain factions allows access to many nice items. for example I am an enchanter the Cenarion circle and the Thorium brotherhood are two examples of factions that as my Rep with them increases from friendly to honored to revered and so on I am able to purchase high level recipes such as +22 int and +15 resist. Now in terms of reputation with Darnassus in the case of NEs if you are honored with Dar than you receive a 10% discount from vendors. Hope that helped you can research the rewards for reputation of the separate factions here.<br />

Is there a safe way to get to Scarlet Monestary from there?  I tried to go thru The Bulwark, and got nailed by a ?? spider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said I found it quicker to go that way with one corpse walk than to hoof it all the way around the long way.  I would recommend taking off all your gear for the run (unless you have the 4 piece PvP set bonus or something) and running naked to avoid repair costs.  Swim across the lake and cheetah as straight and fast as you can.</div></div><hr />

So if I run from Chillwind Point, swim across the lake, I'll die only once?  Then wisp back to that spot and continue?</div></div><hr />

If you do your best to avoid pats that walk across the road, and stay out of the aggro radius, you should be able to do it with maybe one death.  <br />
<br />
What sucks is running in a group with others that don't have travel form, or without a hunter with Aspect of the Pack.  I would usually just put myself on follow and go make a sandwich or something :P</div></div><hr />
