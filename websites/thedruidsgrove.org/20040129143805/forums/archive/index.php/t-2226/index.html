<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crescent Heartwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried the search feature.. no luck..<br />
I tried looking through first 4 or 5 pages of the relevant forums.. no luck..<br />
<br />
I have seen a thread somewhere about what the Fecund Luggald Flesh was for and remembered it being a *somewhat* interesting item.. I think.. but I can't recall who/what/where it gets turned into.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone say what it's for or point me to a thread I overlooked, please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purestone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The quest is for the signet of grisk (check my Goal profile in my magelo at the bottom for stats).  You turn it into Taxonomist Darwin Grisk in West Freeport.  First of all you need the regular luggald flesh which drops in Dulak's Harbour (i think!) fairly often.  Collect 3 of the flesh.<br />
<br />
You talk to the taxonomist guy and he gives you a box to combine them in, you hand in the combined box back, and get nothing.  However, when you then prompt him again, he gives you another box, you then need to collect Fecund Luggald flesh from the Crypt of Nadrox.  This flesh is slightly rarer.  You combine 3 of them in the box and hand it back to the taxonomist.  <br />
<br />
After doing this, you get nothing, but he asks you to seek out a dark elf in Tox.  You find Assistant T`os who, on hailing, summons a skeleton you must kill.  I haven't gotten to this part yet, since I need one more Fecund Luggald flesh which I am too lazy to get atm.  However, I believe the skeleton requires the assistance of a group.  Loot the &quot;cursed heart&quot; from the skele's corpse and run over to WFP again and hand it to the Taxonomist, and he will give you the signet. (or a melee item if you are a melee)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KrystofC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are two versions of this quest (both are pretty much identical, the only differences being the NPC you begin with and the reward for your work).  Here are the links:<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2393&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;West Freeport Version&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2394&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Neriak Commons Version&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Note that this quest runs off a hidden flag system -- you must go through each step, no shortcuts!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Helped my friend with this quest a couple weeks ago.  The flesh is rare, but not horribly so.<br />
<br />
As for the skelly, be prepared to run out and track him after you hail.  He spawned in the water a *long* way off from where the inky was, I had to go out and find him and pull him back.<br />
<br />
I cant remember if it HT'd... I think it did cause our chanter died like BOOM, but otherwise it wasnt too bad.  My 64 bard friend tanked him no prob, with a mage and necro for damage and me healing.  It is amusing... the skelly is HUGE, I was laughing all the way back on the pull hehe...<br />
