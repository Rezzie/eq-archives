<br />
Returning player here.  Left around the time LDoN arrived and have recently started anew.  Currently have a lvl 55 druid.  I have a lvl 31 cleric on another account that I'd like to help lvl up.  I've only read about shrouds and have no personal experience with them.  It seems like I could shroud down to approximately lvl 45, group with the cleric, park the cleric, and solo.  Can anyone share their experiences with shrouds?  Is this method of xp'ing the cleric worth it?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

If I now understand shrouds correctly, they are all monster shrouds.  When people talk about shrouding down to say lvl 45, they mean that they are choosing a particular lvl 45 monster shroud, correct?<br />
<br />
My previous impression was that you could shroud yourself down to a particular level.  For example, I could be myself (a druid) but at level 45 and then just solo while grouped with the toons I want to PL.  That doesn't seem to be the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I unretired my SK, who was level 53 and naked, I played him shrouded a lot to catch him up.  The fastest I found (altho shroud exp has been nerfed) was the wizard shrouds....kei (or potion) and sow (or potion) and I could kite fast'n'easy.  The berserker basilisk is also good, does well tanking and has a nice regen buff.<br />

And if you can manage to open the kobold rogue, that's worth it to watch him &quot;play dead&quot;.</div></div><hr />
