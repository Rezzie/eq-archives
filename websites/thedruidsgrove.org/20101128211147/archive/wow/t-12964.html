<br />
I have used the entangling root pull a couple of times, but last night I learned a new trick.  The Nature's Grasp pull.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Mark a melee mob you want to CC with Nature's Grasp<br />
 Shift to bear<br />
 Start Nature's Grasp<br />
 Enrage if you want<br />
 Pull the above mob with FFF<br />
 Might even want to run toward the mob<br />
 Once he is rooted, target skull and turn around and backup a bit so you can swipe/maul (glyph) the rest of the pack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not only does this allow you to CC a mob while in bear form, it also gives you a bit of extra rage from the hit or two the CC mob does before you start swiping the rest of the pack.  Use barkskin if you are afraid of too much initial damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thinks it safe to say, I have not used it since I hit 70!  Lol...Noob druid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real trick with barkskin is knowing when to pop it, like if the boss has a soft enrage or somthing like that.</div></div><hr />

For trash pulls I don't use mangle the first few hits so I don't have to worry about running out of rage, but for boss fights I typically start with mangle.<br />
<br />
We'll see.  Either that or I'm going to have to start remembering to use it.  For all you Druids tanks that wanted &quot;more buttons to push&quot; I hope you're happy.</div></div><hr />
