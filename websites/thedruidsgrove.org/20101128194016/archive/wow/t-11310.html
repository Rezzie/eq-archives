<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">11-30-2006, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK....after years of EQ on one server, i find myself confused about server choice on WoW. I want a normal non-PvP server, the game suggested Korialstrasz, a new server. It seems when  I log on, it is usually full and I have to wait to get on. Geez, I never heard of that on EQ. I am used to just logging in.<br />
Anyway....I see on the server choice columns it says population low, medium, high and full. <br />
What are the advantages to each?<br />
Is it really that hard to find groups on a low population server?<br />
Would a brand new player benefit more on a high/full population?<br />
I am a 90% solo player. So wouldn't the low population benefit me with more mobs and easier to find named mobs up?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like Malfurion, and have a 45 Hunter and some alts all in Alliance there.  Send Viorel a letter if you go there, I'll send you a few bags (the most usefull thing at first).  The guild I'm in would probably welcome you in and there are lots of ppl to answer questions.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest taking herbalism and another gathering skill like skinning or better yet mining, sell your wares in the Auction House.  You can get much more than enough money to buy decent gear until you need to raid (if you ever do).<br />
<br />
I play west coast USA, but solo nearly only.  Other great solo classes are hunter and warlock. The others I cann't really speak of as my highest alts are only in mid 20s.<br />
<br />
Things favor Alliance and elves/humans, but Horde is also a great faction to play.  But remember, you can mail things to your alts, but only if they are on same server and same faction.<br />
<br />
The Dark Elf Druid starting city is awesome, loads and loads of quests. Once you are in mid teens, you could go to Iron Forge/Stormwind and there are loads of newbies and mostly new alts in the lower zones, but more mobs that you could ever solo.<br />
<br />
Bags, initially are the most important thing you need, as armor comes quick, more than you'll need.  Next you'll need a weapon to do decent damage.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

I just need to figure out if I am going to play a Mage or Druid. I think deep down I always wanted to be a Wizard on EQ and the WoW Mage reminds me of it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">12-01-2006, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Malfurion is where I'm at.  We haven't had queues since Dec of last year shortly after the server went live.  We're a medium pop server so I don't see that changing too much here in the near future either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">12-01-2006, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You never get queues? I envy you. I began the week Aerie Peak started, and it was fine for a while... Until blizzard forgot to change the status from &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Suggested&quot; to &quot;High.&quot; I don't know what's the worse queues have ever gotten on other servers, but I hit about 950 something in line at one point during the summer. *grumbles*<br />
<br />
Thankfully the population is down to the point where we rarely get queues anymore.</div></div><hr />

I have no interest in PVP what so ever, so this server suits me great. My wife plays a Tauren druid, but I am really tempted to start one as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">12-03-2006, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure the queues are bad but there are things older servers such as Burning Legion and Blackrock have to offer (besides terrible hardware which is being upgraded...slowly...and the queues). You get a balanced economy and it's a lot more fun. I've xferred with my guild to a lower population server (and we met Ropetown here too =D) but this server is horrible to buy mats off the AH and world PvP is rare.<br />
<br />
Tbh, Low pop servers are harder to find groups with but the thing with them are, since it is new the amount of people rerolling there is higher so you can get groups for the lower instances easier.</div></div><hr />

is mayhap what explains the differences between a normal and a RP server best.</div></div><hr />
