<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">04-01-2007, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soo... after helping so many guildies with saving Thrall and now Black Morass, I ended up hitting exalted with Keepers of Time today.  &gt;.&gt;  I was looking over this trinket - http://thottbot.com/i29181 - and I just can't figure out if I should buy it or not.  I'm feral, do a fair share of tanking and DPSing, will most likely be offtanking in Kara.  Right now in my tanking set I'm using MoT and SHotM for my trinkets, but I'm wondering if the sta on this sucker might be useful in some occasions... plus it has res, so I could drop the def in my gear a bit as well, which may or may not help.  I'd have 19k armor I guess, instead of 20.  The use ability would be useless for tanking of course, but I guess I could use it for kitty if I get desperate for dropping threat.  <br />
<br />
Thoughts?  Anyone else considering this one, or am I better off just waiting for the Kara dodge trinket or that compass that drops in heroic underbog?</div></div><hr />

I'm using the Regal Protectorate and MoT (Keep my SHoTM in my bags) for tanking.  I like being able to temporarily increase my hp by 1200 or so (the 900 on the tooltip gets the Dire Bear multiplier).  It's saved me a few times.<br />

Cower works well for me on threat in cat form.  The only drawback is that it costs energy, though if I draw aggro, I need to lay off for just a sec on shredding anyway, so I have time to regen the energy.</div></div><hr />

Still gotta finish my KoT rep for the shard though ^^</div></div><hr />
