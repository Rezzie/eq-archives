I guess they were decent for level 52 items, but nothing really impressive for level 60.<br />

Will see if I can find the link.</div></div><hr />

Do you think that, for the sake of those of us shackled behind firewalls in cubicles you could post the rewards on TDG?<br />
<br />
Thanks!  :)</div></div><hr />

You need to get 8 mushrooms from the blood pedal sprouts, this was pretty easy.  Then you ned to get 8 stingers from Wasps at the south side of the crater.  There aren't many wasps and the respawn isn't very good either.  The drop rate also could beb better.  It ook a long time to just get 8 stingers.  Once you turn in the mushrooms and the stingers, you then get a toxin that you must test on a Devilsaur.  You just walk up to him and stick him with it.  Then run like heck.<br />
After you turn in that quest you get a quest to retrieve a  Putrid Vine from the guardian at the bottom of the Sunken Temple.  Then you can choose a druid item for your reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To do :<br />
- Kill 6 troll mini bosses<br />
- Click 6 statues in proper order<br />
- Summons boss at bottom<br />
- Kill &amp; enjoy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hibernate, stab, then run :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repelsteel</div><div class="date">04-05-2006, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this quest line with a lvl60 druid from our guild and a druid passing by on the same quest. We first did the stings which took very long to find because we all needed them... <br />
<br />
They already had the mushrooms so that 3rd guy went away giving in his quest and already went to ST and waited for us there. While I was on the look for the sprouts my guild m8 noticed a devilsaur passing by and hibernated it all the way until I found all the sprouts, gave my quest in and went back to him!! That had to about 10 mins lol :) The stabbing part was easy then, we finally killed the poor bastard... Then we three did the last part in ST. I took the Grizzled Pelt (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=53221) for my feral setup, it's better then the Warbear Harness (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=16155). And I finished another quest there in ST btw by quickly opening the altar in the middle :)<br />
<br />
Oh and a tip for when you guys are doing that boss in ST, go hide below the balkony (left of the stairs when you look down on it from above just if you were going to walk down), wait until he walks almost up the stairs or at least close to (and of course away from the other elites that is), then pull him and stay below the balkony and attack him, when he blasts you away you won't go far because of the balkony :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We pulled the trash mobs that were down there first, then battled the boss.  I tanked, the rogues did their thing, and that was that.  We had 3 deaths the whole run.  The warrior, me and the other druid.  I died at the sleeping dragon ( don't remember the name ) when I went to healer/caster to keep the warrior alive and thinking back on it I should have just stayed tank and held aggro.  Oh well, another time.</div></div><hr />

This is a really fun way to do this zone, basically an all druid stealth group. Worked well!</div></div><hr />
