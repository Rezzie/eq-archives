<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been chugging away at tradeskills to get to my goal of shawl 8.  I failed on the second to last combine for shawl 7 and need to redo some parts.  The only thing I payed for was the Runed Sea Shell with one charge EB.  Unfortunately I need this item again.  I have not seen it for sell in bazaar for a while now, its either the 5 charge EB or the Cloudy Runed Sea Shell.  <br />
<br />
My question is where does the Runed Sea Shell drop and off of what mob?  I have been told sirens in CS drop it but I have yet to see one.  they have dropped the 5 charge EB item.  Is this a solo or group adventure?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bolodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have found info that says I need to go to SG for this drop.  I have crawled SG some but have not found sirens, plenty of sea horses and others but really haven't seen any sirens.  Is there a particular place to set-up to kill these and can I get to it solo or is group required?<br />

Soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The well is near Western Wastes side of the zone, btw. There's 2 of those Uthork guys guarding it. Invis up and drop down. Sometimes there's a see invis mob at the bottom. If that happens you can charm kill usually - although it's generally pretty risky. Otherwise, drop down, swim right then left and up out of the water. Lots of sirens there so be careful. It's a fun place to hunt though - soloable but make sure you have high MR and gate mem'd ;p Would be easier/faster taking a friend along. The shells are pretty common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I got 4 of each type of shell, 5 bp gems, an immaculate shell horn, and a neck with 5 charges of eb in about an hour down there.<br />
<br />
One of the funny things about fighting sirens is that other than tashing you (which they all do nearly constantly, don't bother curing it, they'll just cast it again) they tend to have their own personality, some chain nuke, some chain mez, some chain charm, some chain annul.  The ones that mostly mez are the easiest, mez is easy to resist and even if it lands they'll break it nearly instantly with something else, charm is just funny, though if you're using charm too it causes some odd things, the nukers are annoying, but not really dangerous, since all enc nukes have a stun component, it makes them a bit easier to resist.  Worst type are the ones that will chain annul you, if you get one, don't bother rebuffing until after its dead (except for clickables anyways since if they annul you again there's no mana lost).<br />
<br />
Oh, btw the elemental guys are immune to snare, bloody annoying, don't bother killing them without a DC pet unless you absolutely have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bolodo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the information.  Is that well inside a big hut looking kind of thing where there are 2 Mobs guarding it?  There are sparkling blue lights in this hut between the 2 mobs and it is above water.  <br />

Anything and everything you will want to know about the shawls, can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/intro.htm&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
I think the shawl quests are great.  Love having my 8th, not only for the effects, but knowing the he** I went through to get it...hehe</div></div><hr />
