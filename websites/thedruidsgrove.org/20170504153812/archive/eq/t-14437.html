I went back to the cave were Melgen is and if you go behind him there are some rocks. Go in invis'd and get behind the rocks and hail him and I was able to get the task.  Went out and killed the 11 mobs (none summon) came back in invis'd, hailed him and finished the task.<br />

550+ minutes despawns on zoning.  Shaman AA swarm pet causes their to despawn =P.<br />
<br />
Opposing factions are Kobolds and Orcs<br />
<br />
You can get the quest and complete it while KoS, further quests require more factioning via killing the opposition.<br />
<br />
No mobs summon for this quest.  It is a relatively challenging solo, but you can also do it with a group.  I did mine in a group and got the 2 casters our arcane one, and the 4 melle the battle one.<br />

updated that, thanks ;)<br />
<br />
As for the useability of this vs normal clickies?<br />
<br />
I use this when soloing now.. with ooc regen I take the mana regen hit for the boost to dodge.. the HP regen is laughable vs mobs that smack you for 600-2500/hit but the dodge mod is a better boost IMO.  Raids I'll stick to my standard clcikie, as well as most grouping.<br />
<br />
This item was more intended as a clickie for the casual/non raider, along the lines of the MMM clicky from the efficiency trial.<br />

I got 8 mana regen click, but if this doesn't take a buff slot, I would love it hehe. Always struggling there... no buff slot aa's =)<br />

<br />
It does indeed take up a buff slot and a word of warning regarding the /hail. In Malgen's room I found a High Priest (or something similar) that saw through invis. He was on the right wall as you enter. He hit me for approx 2.5k 3 times with a proc of 2400. That destroyed me...but you can hug left wall to avoid him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for some added info - you can do this quest at full KoS to the other kobolds / gnolls or thatever they are, you just need to be careful.<br />
 <br />
I did this last night and it only took an hour or less to solo.  You can pull the wolves and the orcs from the camp single if you are careful.  None of them summon and they can be kited or root-dotted.  When i got the task, I basically went in invis, found the guy, hailed him, and he didn't respond because I was invis.  So I would hit uninvis, hail, my shared camo hotkey to reinvis quick so as not to aggro his friends.  Rinse / repeat for each phrase until you get the task.  I don't recall the phrase to start it, but you could probably just use that one.<br />
 <br />
HOWEVER, after I made all the kills and went back to hail him, at that point I was with a necro buddy of mine who thought a wolf familiar would be cool (he was pissed later when he discovered it wouldn't stack with his pet), I was invis behind the mob, prepared to do the same thing, when I hit my hail button - still invis - just to let my friend know who was the quest mob . . . and it worked for finishing the task.  So, the hard part was getting in there to get the task.  Not bad.<br />
 <br />
The buff on the familiar doesn't stack with Maelin's / Reyfwin's / etc, but it's almost as good.  May be better for soloing than raiding with the 20% dodge mod.  Also, the buff lasts, for me (though I don't know what would affect it) 539 minutes.  So, it's really nice to not have to worry about recasting it, like, ever.</div></div><hr />

This is new. You have to actually choose your reward now. You can use your EQ button to retrieve that one you did the task for. EQ Button &gt; Quests &gt; Rewards. In the bottom right corner you'll see Select Option. Click it to retrieve your reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone confirm that when you use this it won't lower your mana regen if you're using a clicky buff of more mana regen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note that this also means you don't have to choose your reward right away.<br />
<br />
However, you can only have 5 rewards pending in the reward window.  If you get a 6th, it will overwrite the oldest reward that you have waiting.<br />
<br />
The familiar will NOT stack with Maelin's Methodical Mind, Chaotic Enlightenment, or any other mana regen buff in that line.  It also prevents you from having a pet (charmed or otherwise).<br />
<br />
While the familiar does last for hours, it will disappear when you zone.  Not a big deal, but just something to remember if you zone frequently.<br />
<br />
The dodge modifier appears to be equivalent to Improved Dodge II.  Given that it is a spell rather than a worn modifier, I would expect it to stack, but would have to do a lot of parsing to confirm it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does not stack with MMM.  You cannot use this clickie if you have MMM up (it won't stick.)<br />
<br />
I am opting to use the familiar for the dodge boost over the 2 mana regen I lose by not using Efficiency belt.  I am not sure what I will do on raids though.<br />
<br />
The familiar counts as a pet so no charming/summoning a normal pet.  You can still use the Nature's Guardian aa.<br />
<br />
It does take up a buff slot.</div></div><hr />

I sneak / hide to get into camp, then dropped hide to speak with Malgen (be sure to place yourself between rocks and other mobs to not attract attention).  <br />
<br />
Once I hailed him, he turned scowling.  So I waited until he turned away and turned indifferent again.  I didn't hail a 2nd time, but used the phrase &quot;Talk good&quot; to proceed in the quest giving process.  Again he turned scowling, so I waited again for indifferent to say &quot;do that&quot;.  Presto chango - I got the quest.<br />
<br />
I returned to POK, dropped shroud, and headed for Icefall to kill me some wolfies.  It's just wrong to kill wolves as a druid, but I did what I was asked.<br />
<br />
Once the killing was complete, there was no need to shroud up again.  Just returned to Malgen as my druid self and hailed to receive the reward.</div></div><hr />

I parsed the dodge effect from this item.  It's not an extensive parse so I won't post exact numbers, but the dodge portion of the buff is as equal to 5-10 avoidance.</div></div><hr />
