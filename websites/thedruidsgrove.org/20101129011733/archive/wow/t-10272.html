Is the game still as addictive?</div></div><hr />

Look, I quit to sleep ( sometimes ) and go to work...I just like to play, I don't need it.  I really can quit..<br />

Ok, no...I can't.  I'm hooked.  *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres a lot of new content now with the AQ instances and more Silithus quests.  I'm sure you'd get sucked back in no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayze</div><div class="date">03-17-2006, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But are you really that anxious to deal with the lag, server downtimes, and Blizz's wonderful admin?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I checked out the AQ stuff, it was incredbile.  I also love how our precious stormwind gaurds were sitting away from all the danger... :clap:</div></div><hr />

I think I've gone from the newb with all the questions hear to a source for a least some of the answers, not a lot of regulars still post here from when you were very active.<br />
<br />
I also think I'm gaining some converts to the Moonkin camp.</div></div><hr />

If I ever roll a druid again, count me in mort. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astrel</div><div class="date">03-23-2006, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The server stability seems to be pretty bad.  Atleast on Bonechewer we can't go into MC/BWL without lag spikes all over.  And from I can tell, everyone on the entire server gets booted from the server at random times during the day.  That's just my server.  Plenty of other servers have been having various issues as well.  Be prepared for queue's and lag if you come back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">03-24-2006, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No queues on Nathrezim usually pretty stable just FYI, if you are looking to start over. On that note how long does Blizz save your account if you go inactive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulelendamuwi</div><div class="date">03-24-2006, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm 99.9% sure that they keep it for a looooooong time, if not forever.  They want you to come back and you'll be more likely to if you don't have to start from stratch.  I played for two months after launch, stopped until June and when I started again my characters were all still there (though I've started from stratch, too many annoying kids on the alliance side).  FFXI didn't do that, one of the many reasons I don't play that game any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">03-25-2006, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Blizz has stated several times that they don't delete accounts at all, and they'll let people know if they ever change that policy.<br />
<br />
3 month deletions was a pretty bad move on Square's part (though they semi-recently went to 12 month deletions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">llamadruid</div><div class="date">04-05-2006, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, no. Crackcraft is not addictive. Not at all. Well, maybe a bit. Alright fine, it is addictive as hell.<br />
<br />
Oh, and they have even fewer hamsters per server than they used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starfire</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol.<br />
Forgot to check back.<br />
<br />

How is everything?<br />
<br />
<br />
Me and Cenarius are still kickin' ass and taking names. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a game itself, which is better, FFXI or WoW?<br />
<br />
And, what's a &quot;hamster&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never played FFXI.  Hampster is the thing running on the wheel to power the server.</div></div><hr />

Wake up Astrel!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran into Nyte on the new Duskwood server, he completely forgot about me, the druids grove, and the rest of us.<br />
I wouldn't let him alone until he remembered, then the server crashed lol.</div></div><hr />
