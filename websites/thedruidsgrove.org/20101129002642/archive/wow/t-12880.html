<br />
I've been Feral most of my toon's career.<br />
<br />
Then gave Retor a shot.<br />
<br />
Now i'm Balance, which honestly is the most fun for me.<br />
<br />
However, as a result my gear is too much of a mish mash of this and that, and i'm not very happy with it.<br />
<br />
Take a look:<br />
http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=The+Sha%27tar&amp;n=Rootlore<br />
<br />
Any tips on what to improve with this gear ? since i don't have any more level 70 quests left...:(<br />
<br />
SO talk to me Normals/Heroics.....Kara is not an option right now.....PVP, well i hate PVP, but for one item or two, if i must, i'll grind PVP as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talk to me, also enchants ans Gems and Spec advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!!!</div></div><hr />

A good overview of all items that drop in instances, and can be filtered by talent spec.<br />
<br />
Generally I wouldn't worry too much. The expansion will be here in roughly 5 weeks - and there you will get enough good balance gear in the first few quests. Actually all of it will be better than anything you could pick up in 5-mans now. So I'd simply wait until I get to Northrend. You will be replacing anything that you could reach now in the first day of playing or so.</div></div><hr />

That is, if you remember going to BC for the first time in blues and purples, and replacing them with greens within the first 2 levels, WotLK may give us a little more work to do before replacing epic gear. But only time will tell.. and I'm getting antsy!<br />

<br />
But Cuthbert has stated that 5-mans are the only ones he can run... I am pretty sure those blue items will not last him long.<br />
<br />
Can anyone who is playing beta comment on that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cuthbert</div><div class="date">10-06-2008, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a little update!<br />
<br />
Press my Armory link again - my items got a little upgrade.<br />
<br />
It seems i'll be doing some Kara and Heroics as well, don't forget i can use badges too!  And PvP is an option as well, though not a very good one for me :D<br />
<br />
<br />
So any items i should be on a lookout for, regardless of WolTk?<br />

Thanks.<br />

Sure grab some upgrades where you can, but once you step off the boat into Northrend most of the gear will be a small step below Kara gear.  Unless you can rapid fire gear up, be prepared for rapid replacement.  The transition point between expansions is the perfect time to swap specs.</div></div><hr />
