I have played since last October and I have never done any PvP. None. Hell, I don't even know where I'd find a battleground.<br />
<br />
Guess it's mostly because I don't know anyone. 8 months of playing and the best I got is a level 45 Priest. I can't seem to stay on one character.<br />
<br />
Why does everyone like PvP so much?</div></div><hr />

im curious to find out. im 58 now so it may take a while.<br />

<br />
The part I don't enjoy is getting squashed by the Horde 90% of the time.  They definately know what they are doing - they OWN WSG.</div></div><hr />

why?<br />
cause all the little kiddies think: &quot;I wanna be on the 'good' side and not on the bad horde&quot;. So they start alliance!<br />
<br />
Most long time/older players find horde more attractiv.<br />
So i think horde has far more experienced players than alliance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally disagree. Thats just a major stereotype. That logic works the other way as well ('little kiddies' thinking they want to be evil and go horde).<br />
<br />
However the only thing I see affecting why Horde (according to some) are where the good PvPers are...are the racials. There's no denying that WotF / Stun Resist are really good PvP talents. I think it was sort of Blizzards Game design as well. Alliance have (IMO) better PvE racials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">06-28-2007, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been stated by developers/blues that Horde racials lean to favor pvp and Alliance racials ( mostly ) favor PvE.  Diplomacy is HAX! &lt;3 it on my mage though.<br />
<br />
PvP is a nice change of pace of questing, grinding faction rep, instance running hoping for that one drop that just seems to elude you, etc.  <br />
<br />
Any spec can be successful at PvP, it's just how you judge your success.  As a holy priest or resto druid, you shouldn't judge your success on # of kills or how many times you died, but instead, how much you've healed your team members enabling them to kill more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alot of people will disagree but atm I am actually of a fan of how blizzard has done the pvp system (NOT BALANCE).<br />
<br />
Current even a casual gammer can aquire gear on par with upper tier raid guilds by pvpin.<br />
<br />
I myself have gotten tired of the pve grind. Raid at X time for 6hours to aquire gear to kill the next pixel boss to then aquire more gear to kill the next pixel boss etc etc....<br />
<br />
Ive done it for a long time and pvp is a bit refreshing since you can do it in your spare time and honestly aquire gear at almost the same rate as raiding.<br />
<br />
I've always been more a fan of pvp then pve. Simply for the reasons stated above.<br />
<br />
Prior to me atleast wow was becomming very job like. Now I log in when I want have some fun. Win and loose some fights and are able to log off and not feel guilty.<br />
<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; Atleast for me - it's a bit refreshing atm having my own progression scale and enjoyment.</div></div><hr />

Ok.  I don't PvP - unless in a battleground.  You can aquire gear faster as PvP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">06-28-2007, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do it a lot and you get good at it, you can by far farm gear faster in PVP vs. Raiding.  Lets look at a Raid.  lets assume that they have a raid on farm.  You go in once a week and clear the entire instance.  If your lucky, you might get one piece of gear per week at best.  More likely one every other week or ever third week.  Then you are done.  The instance won't reset till next week.<br />
<br />
PVP, you can pvp all week long.  Every day, every weekend, every holiday whatever floats your boat.  Arena, if you have a good team, you could earn some pretty sweet gear every week if you have a good team.  Similar with battlegrounds.  If you are good, and have good matchups, honor is easy to earn.  You can earn honor all day long.  Marks are a little more difficult though.  Either way, pvp can be faster.  It may require more time dedication though.  With the changes in the pvp system, you don't have to earn ranks to get certain gear.  So your only limits are how much time you want to dedicate to pvp.</div></div><hr />

Maybe because I don't have a good raiding guild.. dunno, but I always liked the PvP-angle more than PvE. More fun and challenging to battle real people than a made up algoritm IMO. :)<br />
<br />
But occasional raiding with a nice (and good) guild is really fun also. To bad most occasianol raiding guild aren't that good..<br />

Versatility of WoW. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old school aside, I have to say that I'm a big fan of what pvp has become:  Inter-realm BGs/arenas with nice some imba rewards and giving that extra dimension to WoW :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No doubt, love sitting in LFG for SV all day long and not a single invite/ask/tell for a group.  <br />
<br />
Only other one that annoys me is the 5 man group needed for O'grilla rep.  I fly around seeing if others doing it queue up for it but been weeks since I can find anoyone doing it :frown:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grubluv</div><div class="date">08-10-2007, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;Ok. I don't PvP - unless in a battleground. You can aquire gear<br />
&gt;faster as PvP?<br />
<br />
It's not speed so much as the level of difficulty. You can get 25 random friends together on vent and hit Gruul's, but you're rather unlikely to completely dominate every instance run. Attempting heroic Shattered Halls ten times per week and failing each time won't earn you your purple bracer. There's no need to feel guilty after spending five hours AFKing in heroic crypts, but you probably won't come out of the experience with anything but a slightly higher /played.<br />
<br />
Joining a highly skilled raiding guild will get you geared up quickly; joining a poor one probably won't. On the other hand, you can suck at pvp and still expect excellent rewards.<br />
<br />
For difficulty of acquisition to be equalized, pvp gear would (and IMO should) have a minimum rating requirement or win/loss ratio.<br />
<br />
That having been said, pvp and arena pvp in particular has taught me a *lot* about how to play a druid. Before I started doing arenas, I thought that cyclone was useless. Just the other day, a warlock thanked me for using cyclone to save his arse about half a dozen times in heroic SP. Same with feral charge -- previously, I never thought about using it as a form of CC.</div></div><hr />

Trix, I'll run either with ya on my lock.  If you see me on just ask.  I'm pvp'ing probably 75% of the time im on, otherwise im just grinding for gold / cloth, and will gladly run.  Unless its av weekend and I'm in a guild premade ;)  12.5k honor in 5 hours of winning av is too good to pass up.</div></div><hr />

I haven't really logged on Trixtaa for a while. Whenever I do play it's usually on my priest alt with my brother but yea, I'm playing maybe 2 hours a week right now =/</div></div><hr />

I can play a few rounds of WSG or AB, then logout.  Then on the weekends, I grind to make money.</div></div><hr />
