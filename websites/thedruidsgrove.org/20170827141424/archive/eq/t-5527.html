<br />
I am up to killing the corrupted Seahorse for my epic. I was wondering if anyone knew if there was anything different I should look out for? What I mean is, for instance, the tainted gorilla in EJ that spawns the corrupted looks like a LIVE gorilla. Also the tainted barracuda that spawn's the corrupted follows you onto the land.<br />
<br />
I am also unclear of all the PH's for the seahorse, does he only spawn in one particular area, etc.<br />
<br />
Any advice/information on this would be greatly appreciated, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The seahorse was my bad karma marker =)  Yes, he does spawn only in one specific room in Kedge Keep (He will normally spawn near Estrella), but it's not hard to find if you're with someone who's done it before.  I did my fight for the Kedge Crystals with one nice group of friends 52-60.<br />
<br />
Just watch out:  The seahorses can and do cast on you or whoever has aggro.  Sometimes when you pull one seahorse, you get 2 more or a bunch of mermaids, who come to see what all the fuss is about.  Chaos ensues.  I don't think this is a fight you can do alone unless you're very high level.<br />
<br />
KK was proof I have bad karma because when I was there for my crystals, I bound myself in the safe spot next to the spot you fight the tainted / corrupted in =)  You know, that nice little corner of the room where you're lucky if a fish aggroes on you?  Anyway we pulled to there and I died... and respawned... and died..... Multiply this till you have 17 deaths, one angry and frustrated player, and one deathly confused GM.  I had lotsa corpses hehehe... I lost like 1/3 of a level in the end but I got my crystal and then shortly after my epic... it was fun =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tainted spawns in the Matriarch caves near Undertow and have heard from friend it has spawned in the Patriarch room too, but I haven't personally seen it there.  Here's a map below I hope helps.<br />
<br />
I see you are 52.. with Call of Karana you should be able to charm a seahorse (the cleric ones make decent self healing pets) and possibly solo him.. there are a lot of little bothersome fish in the room outside of Undertow's dome, hiding in cubbyholes in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
To solo it at 52 will be quite a challenge not because of the fight with tainted/corrupted back to back.. but just dealing with all the other mobs around will be quite a drain on your mana. <br />
<br />
I would recommend just popping in from time to time to see if Tainted is up and put out a call to a couple friends to come help if so. <br />
<br />
If Estrella is up, hug the walls when passing by her room, she sees invis and has a rather large agro range it seems, she will make quick work of a single 52 druid with the adds you will get if the bitc... err... if she jumps you.<br />

<br />
I just need to clarify something, I don't plan on doing this one solo, I have a few high level friends that wanna come along. I think I would be suicidal to go in there by myself, lol. Also, I am not very familiar with some of the areas.</div></div><hr />

The tainted can also spawn in Undertow's room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">11-05-2003, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the tainted isn't up yet and you and your friends get there, it's actually not that hard to avoid tough fights (adds) from that point on.  If you and your friends can just get to that room where he usually spawns, it's easy to keep the room until you get him to spawn.  You'll just have to take care of the two mermaids right outside the door every time they pop, otherwise just keep pulling the seahorses from the little alcoves in that cave over and over till he pops.<br />
<br />
When I got my crystals, my group waited in the first and largest of those caves/chambers and I would pull the seahorses from each of the three little alcoves to the group.  There wasn't much downtime and we were able to fight them one or two at a time.  I'd recommend that strategy to you.<br />

BTW... Yeah, it was a &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; idea binding myself that deep into KK...  Go ahead and laugh about it - - I know I do now. =]</div></div><hr />

I apologise if it seemed that way, I did not find it funny at all. Strange??? perhaps :p (hehe). LOL I have made so many mistakes and boo-boo's, if I had all the Xp from all my deaths still I would be level 65!!<br />
All of this information should help me alot though, this was all mainly for my knowledge, just so i don't go in blind.<br />
This site is fantastic too btw :)</div></div><hr />
