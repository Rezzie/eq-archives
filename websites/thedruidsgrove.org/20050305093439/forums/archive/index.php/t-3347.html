They were blue to light blue at that time and very easy to do..just root and nuke. They fell reasonably fast that way.<br />

I cannot answer you on UP, as I have not had the opportunity to hunt in UP yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Con on them doesn't matter in terms of relative level, the level 58 ones have about 400 hp more than the level 54 ones, and the resist rates aren't much different (or at least before the resist revamp; haven't been back to UP since)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radoen</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a few Druid friends with epics you can do the Elysians easy.  I first went there with some Druid guildmates at 53.  There was 3 of us there on avg, usually 2 or more had epics, most of them were 55 to 60.  They die fast.  We all (about 7 total got full Eylsian in about 2 weeks of about 4 hrs a day camping them.  I just went back after I got my epic at 54 and since the DOT stacking changes.  They are MUCH easier now that you can stack your dots with other druids.  Grouped about 4 of us, loaded them with Epic, Winged, DoD from each of us and they were dead in about 2 rounds.  Long as you got a high level friend to root them they are easy. Fire based dots don't work well, so safe your mana and just go with Drifting line.  <br />
<br />
So, you can do it with 2 people, having an epic or more is nice cause of the no mana.  If you get 1 group of druids, load them up on DOTS and they will die much faster.  Don' t worry about having a tank less you have a cleric cause they hit hard, have about 30k HP's and keeping a tank healed will use more mana then it's worth.  DOT group is the way to go on these :-).<br />
<br />
Good Luck!  I Love my Elysian, and I'm sure you will to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arganas</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solo'd Tormented Vah Shir 1 (TVS1) for the first time today. Most were lb or green at 52. The ones I had (minor) problems with were the bat PHs since you can't snare or root them :(  Spawn time is exactly 6 mins.<br />
<br />
Got Tormented to pop twice in two hours. The first time, I had it on track ahead of me. I was confused since I didn't see him, but then I realize it was behind the wall. Click like mad to try to select it but no luck. It eventually despawn :( . I looked around the wall after that then realize that if you put your face right up to the wall, you can peer through it.</div></div><hr />

thanks a lot all<br />

Solo'd one at 53, had mana pool around 3060 mana and kei.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunechantante</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">best thing to aggro tormented or ph is sitting in the wall using wolf form..it decreases your faction and makes all pop scowl at you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kataliya</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're a Tunare worshipper, I'd highly suggest getting a Warden Symbol. It was INVALUABLE when I was farming my own Elysian armor back in the day. The ability to toss on your dots, then chain-root these mobs for zero mana is very helpful, as root doesn't always hold them as long as you might like it to.</div></div><hr />
