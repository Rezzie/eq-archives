This Faction adjustment quest, as well as the Infamous MUFFIN quest no longer work for faction adjustment with the new revamped Freeport.  There are two NPC's with very similar names who give quests for those above level 45 and ther e is a NPC in Silver armor over by the Oasis lake at the three buildings who gives quests for faction adjustment for those level 44 and under (Kill Elite Sand Giants being one of them).<br />
