<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CuteLittleDruid</div><div class="date">11-22-2005, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello again!<br />
I'm looking for a new quest to start, something to work on once I've gone as far as I can with DoN progression (in a couple of days probably).<br />
I'm level 70, mediocre gear, 4.3K or so HP's, magelo link should be in my signature. I raid 5 days a week, my guild is in the Ikki trailsin GoD.<br />
 <br />
One of the things I really enjoyed about doing my epics (1 and 1.5 so far...) was their intricacy. Also, I like that the reward was something relatively unique (and the nice stats help too! :) ), it was such a sense of accomplishment. So I'm after something along the same lines.<br />
 <br />
I've looked into doing the Breakdown in Communication quests, but my guild probably won't be in the end-zone of GoD for quite some time, so that's ruled out. (but this style of quest appeals to me, call me crazy!)<br />
I've also looked at the &quot;Discord Skin Samples&quot; quest but have the same problem: no access to GoD end-zone.<br />
 <br />
Does anyone have any suggestions? <br />
(I'm terrible with abbreviations and acronyms, please go easy on me!)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If you Tradeskill, you can do Signet of the Arcane.<br />
 <br />
If you like DoD missions you can do the werewolve Skull quest, which requires completeing around 24 single group missions across 5 mission arcs.<br />
 <br />
You could also do DoD and quest your Dreadspire Key.<br />

That's a good point about completing the first part of BiC, I honestly had not thought of that!<br />
I looked at the Signet of Arcane quest, but I don't have full elemental access, I only have the PoTime &quot;gimped-in&quot; key. The only other keys/flags to speak of are Old Seb, and the shortcut flag for KT (from doing a Tipt run).<br />
<br />
I'll have to look up the others you mentioned when I'm not at work, too many web-sites are blocked here.<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">11-24-2005, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with others on BiC. Right now is exactly the right time for you to do BiC as later it's going to be very hard to drag people back to these zones to do old content. But if you do it right now, it's still new / current content for your guild.<br />
 <br />
And it still takes so much time that you're probably a lot closer to GoD end zones by the time you have finished everything up to Kod&#711;Taz.<br />
 <br />
If you enjoyed doing your epics, I promise you'll enjoy doing BiC :)<br />
 <br />
Another thing you might look at is Vex Thal key. It's soloable for you, except half of emperor key and of course emperor itself.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
You can solo 3/4ths of the Emporer Key, the only part a druid can not solo is the Named which drop the Insigna, and that is only becuase you need a rogue to open the doors for you =p<br />

The Warden, who also drops the pouch, while hitting upto 400 is rootable and snareable and stops fairly often to cast necromancer spells.  <br />
 <br />
This is compared to, the TMs which are all non rootable, summon and are a mix of casters and melee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was a slacker and didn't start BiC when my guild was progressing through GoD (for completely different reasons actually--I actually quit for a few months and played EQ2, but the punch line is the same).  Now that tacvi is old hat for us, it is a real pain trying to convince people to help me do smith rondo or txevu or whatever.<br />
<br />
If you plan on having it ever, then start it ASAP!<br />
<br />
Same thing with the tongues.  If you plan on finishing that quest ever, start now.  Most guilds give preference on quest items like that to people who are actually up to that point in the quest anyway, so it's a good idea.</div></div><hr />
