<br />
I also did one spice run in Silithus, and got a nice damage buff and a fair bit of CC rep and honor.<br />
<br />
I am wondering how the rest of you feel about the new PvP additions since the patch, or if you would share any stories of your first impressions so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">birdbleed</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rolled an alliance rogue on a pve server when the game was released.  It didnt take long after hitting 60 for me to realise I should have started on a pvp server.  So, I switched to a pvp server on horde side and played a hunter for about a year and now I've had my druid at 60 for a few months (which is why I'm here).  <br />
<br />
Anyway... About the new battlegroups.  A month or two ago, I decided to hop on my rogue and check out the battlegrounds, as they wearnt even released when I quit playing him.  I actually wasnt suprised that the queues were about 1:30 for AV and 2:00 for AB, there never being more than one game up.  Well, to my delight, when I logged him on last night, there were 20 some AVs up and 30-40 ABs and WSGs up.  I queued up and ended up joining in about 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Of course, the lag was terrible, the server kept restarting and it was a little buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Havent got to try them yet but my initial impressions were that this was a great idea. Que times werent terribly bad on my server with the longest que on a slow dow being like 20-30mins for AB/WSG, but there would normally be around 4 or 5 running in the evenings. <br />
<br />
The things Im generally worried about are:<br />
<br />
1. With such a dramatically reduced que time all day, honor grinders will get a significant boost to their honor gain because they can get into more BGs during the day then normally possible on a single server. This will make it that much harder for non-hardcore PvPers to progress in to the higher ranks. (Thankfully this wont be an issue in TBC)<br />
<br />
2. Hopefully I wont have to play with more idiots then I am forced to already on my server. My hopes are that the horde will be a bit brighter on the other reallms in my battlegroup.<br />
<br />
However, I was reading the VN boards and got a kick out of all the whining that is going on about the cross realm BGs. People are complaining about getting rolled by Tier 2/AQ40 premades and I just keep thinking to myself, is there any other type of alliance BG group that exists? I guess when you regularly play against extremely geared people, the cross realm BGs wont up the difficulty of your enemies too much. Im glad all these newbs finally see how much gear makes a difference when they get owned every BG then step into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sugar</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Queue times are indeed awesome.  It only takes seconds and no more than a minute to get into WSG game now.<br />
<br />
However, Alliance teams are all noobs (like myself :wiggle:) and the Horde teams have all been Sergeants or better and totally steam roll us.  I can't convince the other Alliance players to stay in one big group. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well queue times on my server for alliance side were terrible before; 30 mins for a WSG, 1 hr for an AB, and 3-4 hours for AV.  When I saw 20 AVs running and queue time of 11 minutes it was like the heavens opened up and choruses of angels were singing.<br />
<br />
I don't think the speed of getting in will make the honor grind much worse, the system always favored people who put in the most time, now the gap will just be larger, but like you say it will soon be moot.<br />
<br />
What I think will improve dramatically is my rep grind.  They will almost certainly nerf how easy it is to get rep in AV now, since nearly everyone will be able to make exalted in 1-2 weeks.  I'm going to try and make it before a hot-fix comes, then I will get my other two up there and bask in my epic rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason the honor grind will get worse is because during those off hours when hardcore PvPers are still PvPing because they have nothing better to do, they can now get into continous BGs, where before they may have only gotten into 2 or 3 an hour. Think of it kinda like a bottleneck that just got kthx wtfpwned by non stop BGs all day, every day.<br />
<br />
This now allows the hardcore players to skyrocket past you during the time your not playing, where as before they may have only been able to earn like 20k extra honor because there werent many games.<br />
<br />
Either way, its a moot point because the whole honor system is going to be erased.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's pretty much just the luck of the draw now.  One of the AB games I entered was almost immedietly 5 capped against us (alliance) and the very next game, we won with a constant 4 nodes capped.  <br />
<br />
The thing that I think could make a difference is the way they mixed pvp and pve servers together.  I cant help but think that the pvp server folks will have an advantage.  Especially against realms that have never really had the chance to get the experience because of the lack of BGs up before this.  It dosent really matter to me.  I kill people and get my honor just the same, wether we're winning or losing.  The bonus honor of winning is always nice though :P<br />
<br />
Another thing I've been curious about is how this will effect rank progression.  Will your rank still be calculated by the standings on your server only?  Or will it be calculated by the standings on your battlegroup?  I'll admit, I havent read up on this yet but I just figured it'll go by battlegroup.  If it is calculated considering everyone in the battlegroup, some people are going to be in for a rude awakening.  On my alliance server where there's little BG action, the honor you get in a week goes WAY farther than the same amount does on my horde server where there's a lot of people pvping and competing for rank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wont be moved to battlegroups, that is impossible. Only a certain amount of people can be at those high ranks like High Warlord, Warlord, etc. If you try to force what use to be maybe 2,000 players on a server, to now compete with 10,000 players for maybe the 2 available warlord slots, people would be killing each other over it. <br />
<br />
It has to be server related only, but the honor farmers will get a huge boost to their gains because during off hours when most serers dont have alot of BGs and very few players are online, they can still farm honor at a good rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">birdbleed</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the reason I thought that was because I think I read somewhere that they were increasing the number of high rank slots to accomodate this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they can fix the bugs I will be very happy with what it has done.  For example last night I could not speak in raid or group but I could talk in channels.  Also when I died I would not pop at the GY but I'd have to run back!  Sometimes when I was across the field and killing I would pop to the GY and be freshly rez'd.... I'm guessing alot of that was lag issues with the Servers (not me as I run on a High DSL line that is very stable in other games).  Still to early to tell how honor/rank will be affected for me.  I generally play 1-2 hours of grind and about a hour of PvP BG's a night.  I did notice last night I got about 4 games in instead of 1-2.  So although everyone else gains more honor I did too.  Expansion will make this the sure win though , whenever it comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may have got double the honor for the one hour you played, but the person that continued to player after you logged is making double of what he could possibly make before while you werent on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We hear you lorath, everyone is getting more honor, but hardcores will get far more than they used to.<br />
<br />
It'll be interestig to see the rankings page when it updates next week.  During my honor grind to rank 8 I was only making 30-40K honor a week and doing fine since most alliance can't get into many BGs, on my same server horde side it would take hundreds of thousands.  Now the alliance grinders will have hundreds of thousands too, it'll be an interesting jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well yes of course but he was always out honoring me before too :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently not, which isn't surprising at all with blizzards explination of them on their website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">08-24-2006, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I got to try a little more of this stuf last night, but still haven't made my way over to the plaguelands (been based out of Darnassus/Silithus for the most part to avoid lag in IF from patch craziness).<br />
<br />
The queues being shorter is nice, but the rep grind is still going to involve losing hundreds of matches for turn-in marks as long as I am stuck in PuGs, so I am less excited about that than I was.  Although I did meet a moonkin from another server and we've ended up in 3 ABs together so far, what are the odds?<br />
<br />
The dust/spice thing in Silithus is ok.  The speed debuff is a pain as even cheetah with PvP bonus crawls, and mobs are a pest.  I haven't seen anyone actually &quot;fighting&quot; over the stuff yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">08-24-2006, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno about this.  Maybe this is true for the alliance who usually have to wait a long time, but for me, during the day there are usually teams going constantly.  There are only so many games you can do in a given time slot.  So it's not THAT much of a gain (unless your the alliance waiting 2 hours I guess)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">08-24-2006, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is exactly why I ws excited, I was waiting 2 hours on occassion for Abs and usually waiting 4 hours for AVs (I was a 60 for a month, queueing everyday, before I was on long enough to get in an AV).</div></div><hr />

I have found though just in a couple of days, with so many matches you do start to bump into the same people over and again, and eventually you will start to recognize the same pre-made you are up against.<br />
<br />
Thats a good question on the trading, I hadn't even thought of that.  Could really manipulate some economies by importing cheap trade goods from another server.</div></div><hr />
