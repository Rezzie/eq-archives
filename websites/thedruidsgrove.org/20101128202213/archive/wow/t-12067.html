<br />
How much hit rating does a FERAL druid need for both bear form (tanking) and cat form??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">10-08-2007, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Cat Form around 100 hit rating are enough. I am usually between 90 and 100 and miss maybe two or three times per raid instance.<br />
<br />
In Bear Form the same applies, but there is almost no good tanking gear with +hit rating on it. I do not have any hit rating in my tanking gear and still have no problems. Sometimes I need to taunt because I miss three times in a row, but besides that the misses are no problem. Also if you use Earthwarden (http://thottbot.com/i29171), the feral combat skill on it really helps in reducing your miss chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know from playing my hunter, it is the number one DPS stat.  A miss is 0 DPS.</div></div><hr />

FCS is like weapon skill while in Feral Form.  Hit Rating affects both Feral and non-Feral weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For DPS, versus a boss, you'd need either 8.6% chance (135ish hit rating) or 6.00%-6.60% (I've seen it debated) chance (100ish hit rating) and 20 Feral Combat Skill. I have the latter approach in my DPS gear.</div></div><hr />
