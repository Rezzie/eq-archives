I currently have a totem of the warrior spirit.  I'm looking for something that I won't have to upgrade for while, in other words a fairly decent one.  Wis is really what im looking for, my resists are pretty good right now.  Lvl 52 as well, so keep that in mind.  If you have a suggestion please let me know.</div></div><hr />

You can also try the Golden Idol of Tunare (4ac 5wis 6svp/d 40mana).  It's crafted, and is part of the PotC quest.  They go for about 1500 on The Rathe.<br />

There are probably better one's out there but being only 47 I haven't had the opportunity or the cash to get them....<br />

<br />
I don't think that these would cost more than a Tunare idol, the only difference between the two is substituting an imbued Plains Pebble instead of an imbued Emerald during the combine.  If you can find a potter who is willing to make a Tunare idol they should make a Karana idol for the same price....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nodden</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all our suggestions.  I AM a halfling, and follow Karana, so I cannot wear the Golden Idol of Tunare.  Otherwise, I would have gone for that long ago. <br />
<br />
I was also considering that Eye of the Griffon, but being a halfling I start with low charisma anyway.  I know it doesn't matter that much, but I charm animals fairly often.  So, I try to keep my charisma as high as possible, and -20 is a big hit.  <br />
<br />
As for the Ceremonial Smudging Stick, like I said my resists are pretty good for now, I'm mainly looking for something with more Wis than that.  The Seal of Thoridain, same thing..  If anyone has any more suggestions please post them. Thanks again.  <br />

If you're 52, you and 2-3 groups of your friends could get it.  Requires very good CoV faction, and 1 fight in WW, right near the zone-in.<br />

<br />
The Talisman is like a dream that will never come true, because for some reason, despite my attendance at 5 ring wars and many Kael raids, I still am KoS to CoV.  Will keep trying of course, but whatever the faction the Talisman requires is way outta reach for me right now.  <br />

Once again, thanks for your suggestions, if you have anything to add please post.  <br />

One thing you do have to remember tho is to make sure that noone in your group(s) is KoS or they will cause aggro with the Scout.<br />

Good luck with whichever item you choose to go for :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wisdom is not the only thing you need to consider though, note that both the smudging stick and the Seal of thoridain have 30 +mana on them, this is equivalent to about 6 wisdom post-200, without putting you closer to the 255 wis hardcap.  <br />
Also, just because your resists are &quot;pretty good&quot; doesn't mean that more aren't useful, unless of course you've got a pile of NToV/Ssra loots that you're not sharing that make you over 200 in all resists :p <br />
<br />
That Eye of the griffon makes me nauseous, no ac, no +mana, and skimpy on the +hp, and so much negative cha.. ugh.<br />
<br />
But hey, my opinion is skewered, I'm an insane ac/HP druid.  And I tank better than about 75% of the clerics I've grouped with (i.e. the ones who think +7 wis rings are better than ac/hp rings).  And I've still got a larger manapool than most druids I know, and a large majority of comparably leveled druid's that I look at the Magelo profiles of (even considering I still don't have my epic, that one piece of gear doesn't make up the atrocity of a 55+ druid wearing splitpaw gloves; barring unusual circumstances anyways, like losing a corpse.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, whatever, re: gloves.<br />
<br />
I wore splitpaw gloves from 3 hours /played until half way through 59.  That's when I was present for a drop of the Coldain Skin Gloves and won them.<br />
<br />
For Wood Elf Druids, there are very few low to mid-end gloves worth a hoot.  And Coldain Gloves were on my list of things to buy, but were always getting bumped down the list.  I mean, no gear is really worth much to a high-end caster, unless it's got a clicky, or focus/FT.  Once you get reasonable stats, upgrades don't mean a whole lot.<br />
