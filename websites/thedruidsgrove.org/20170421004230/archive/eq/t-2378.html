I poked around there with a throwaway toon the other day, and only way I could find into the city proper was via an elevator and a no drop key. Only other guards I saw were the two in the newbie area. So how do you kill guards here without having two accounts or screwing the newbies?</div></div><hr />

There are quite a few skelly guards wandering around in Paineel for the killing, drop a sword and shield as well for selling.  Didn't take faction hits for killing them, which was pleasantly surprising.<br />
<br />
Was a bit amusing killing some of the NPC's in there.  Apparently there are a few who do not like each other and will actually assist you as you kill the one that was standing next to them... heheh</div></div><hr />

Go to Warrens, summon your bear pet (you can use the lvl 12 fire pet summoned from that item that drops in guk if you buff him up and watch his health).<br />
<br />
Now make a hotkey with the following text:<br />
/pet attack a kob<br />
/pet attack a lesser<br />
/pet attack a howl<br />
<br />
This covers most the mobs. I suggest you follow the cave to the right after zoning in, down by Prince mobs are lower lvl = faster kills.<br />
<br />
Stand there and spam that hotkey, your pet will go nuts killing kobolds. After a while (hour or two maybe) you should have enough faction to get into Paineel.  Go to the newbie guard, hail, say &quot;Need Key&quot; and he will give you one. <br />
<br />
Now head on down, and slaughter the guards. ONE is LB at 60, the rest are greenies. I see lvl36 chanters and monkies down here getting exp and loot. There is a bank and plenty of merchants.<br />
<br />
Each guard drops a bronze sword(3pp) and a kite shield(4pp) and they can drop up to 4pp.  I just walk through with WildFire and own the city pretty fast. Dont pull the one wanderer when he is near the lvl50 skelly musicians, they will agro. (If they agro you, run through a portal and gate). <br />
<br />
I find I can make bout 100pp on a full bar of mana, maybe 600 to 700pp per hour with a KIE. Prolly better plat than HG since its easier to get a mob, and easier to kill. I would rather quad HG in off hours though. <br />
<br />
I wouldnt worry bout this zone getting nurfed, they already nurfed the bronze sword vallue from 10pp to 3pp, so VI knows bout this spot. <br />
<br />
BTW, nothing here gives faction hits.<br />
<br />
There ya go, enjoy, go make some plat.<br />

Those are the most unresponsive newb guards in the game. Killing the key guy might piss off people trying to get it. <br />

Paineel is a cool city :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaeia</div><div class="date">02-13-2003, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The two guards in the newbie yard are permarooted, level 5, nearly 100% resistant to all spells, hit like a truck and have a royal buttload of hp.<br />

On the plus side, they don't go on KSing sprees like the infamous Bandits of Rivervale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klath</div><div class="date">02-15-2003, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I experimented with a number of ways of killing Kobolds in the Warrens in order to get my heretic faction to Amiable so that I could get the key to Paineel.  The methods I tested included using a pet,  nuking, meleeing, porcupining, and PBAOE.  The mobs run when their HP gets low so any approach that didn't kill them outright wound up being mana inefficient and time consuming.  In the end, I found that the fastest way to drop the Kobolds was PBAOE.  <br />
<br />
Once I settled on using PBAOE, I would run through the various sections of the Warrens and aggro every mob I saw using my lowest level nuke.  When I had accumulated a good following I'd  then drag them off into a corner and cast Upheaval.    A single cast would always drop all of the mobs including the named ones.   Frequently, when I had a particularly large train after me, my casting would be interrupted several times but, with a little perseverance, I'd always get the spell off.   It's quite amusing watching 30-40 mobs running after you especially if they are all following the same path -- it really does look like a train.  <br />
<br />
Sadly, I didn't log my visits there so I can't say for sure how many mobs I killed in order to get my faction to Amiable.  I would estimate that I cleared all (most) of the spawns about 10 times and that it took about 15 minutes to clear the spawns once.  My faction to start off with was &quot;scowling ready to attack&quot; and was probably worse than the average Halfling druid because I'd taken a number of faction hits with the Heretics in the past.  <br />
<br />
I imagine that this approach could be used to raise faction for an entire group of people if, just prior to casting the PBAOE, everyone in the group would heal or buff the puller caster.   I think that this would/could allow them to take the faction hits as well.  I haven't really tested this so I can't say for sure.  <br />
<br />
One word of advice, however, is that you take great pains not to do this when there are people hunting in the zone.  When I did it I would ask the other folks in the zone where they were hunting and then stay clear of them.   I briefly considered offering 100pp and looting rights to the person/people who could deliver to me the biggest train.  I decided not to do this, however, as I'm sure it would have lead to a lot of deaths (other than the Kobolds :-).  <br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />
