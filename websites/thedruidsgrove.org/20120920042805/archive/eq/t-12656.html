So I sit back and wait until it's not grey-out any longer because I want to play with it!...and wait...and wait...buff timers were getting low so I head back to the guild hall...and wait....and wait :mad2: (reminds me of spirit of cheetah...but that sure is fun in the guild hall with levitate on!)<br />
I finally decide to look it up on Alla to see why it's taking so long...900 second re-cast? Lasts for 18 seconds??? Wow, was I ever surprised!<br />
Does anyone here use this spell? I'm just curious in what situations it would be useful. I finally got my 9th spell gem and I love it! Is this spell worth keeping memorized in any particular situation? (I'm thinking solo or group-puller maybe?)</div></div><hr />

Its used when you pull aggro, or are offtanking something for a few seconds becuase aggro isn't on the tank yet.<br />
 <br />
It reduces all incoming melee by 75 percent (making a 1k hit 250) and has a chance to proc a effect which lowers your hate on that mob by 400.<br />
 <br />
The spell will last 18 seconds, or until its mitigated 5000 points of damage.<br />
 <br />
The Recycle time is 15 minutes.<br />

 <br />
This is the oh crap I'm gonna die spell for us.  Cast it and you have a chance of lasting long enough for another person to pull aggro/heal you, or channel a heal through the hits.  It is a setup so its not something you can chain cast on you at all times making it so you have to pick and choose your uses.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">11-17-2005, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I keep this spell constantly memmed and hotkeyed.  It's just like our own version of Divine Aura in that the 1 second it takes to cast can save you.  You get aggro, pop it and mob will hit like a CB orc for enough time to heal yourself or someone to gank aggro.  It's an &quot;oh ****&quot; spell for sure, but it's one of the best self-preservation abilities we get besides Exodus.<br />
<br />
The few minutes ot takes to pop and repop after using it are more than worth the 18 seconds you get from the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">11-17-2005, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also important to remember the harder a mob hits, the less time the effect will be in use.  If  a mob hits 6k for example, it will only last 2 hits.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">11-17-2005, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's perma-memmed in my spell book. Has saved me enough times already... even making it a rival to exodus :)<br />
<br />
The long recast is intentional to make it more in line with clerics' and paladins' DA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaeuvian</div><div class="date">11-17-2005, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perma memmed, imo this spell is much better then DA because we can heal/get healed in the time its on us :) . Is also good if you need to paci full somewhere when mobs warp and hti for quite a bit or fast, wack it on and luckily enough you get a proc of neg 400 hate and tank has easy aggro and your not dead :p</div></div><hr />

In addition to the great Mitigation I have found the anti-agro proc also works on occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CuteLittleDruid</div><div class="date">11-18-2005, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I am *so* glad I asked about this spell!<br />
I can't wait to give it a try on my next raid (i'm a mostly-raiding type; my guild is working on the ikki trials in GoD)<br />
I went on a combat-avoidance-aa buying spree recently, was utterly sick to death of getting aggro for a split second and getting one-rounded, as they say. I'm less than pleased at the results of so many aa's spent (only have around 220 aa's, have all but the last two steps in the last set of the avoidance line, precognition i think?). not that i think druids are under-powered or un-balanced or anything (and don't want to see yet another thread de-raild into that &quot;discussion&quot;), i just think my expectations were too high and were not really based on any particular facts :redface: <br />
So that's a long winded way of saying that I think this spell might really be useful to me based on what you all have said; this might just be the solution to the saving-my-hide-when-i-accidentially-get-aggro-on-a-mob-thats-much-bigger-than-me problem I've been looking for!<br />
I really wished I'd checked back on this thread before raiding tonight...I can't wait to try it out now!:smile: <br />
 <br />
Thank you all so much for your encouraging response, I do appreciate it:wavey:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">11-18-2005, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would recommend you get Spell Casting Subtely as that will probably help you more than Precognition.  And this spell, like pretty much all spells we get, is VERY situational and when you use it, you hope for the best.  Tank pulls aggro back, someone lands a heal, you channel a heal, hit exodus/evac whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">11-19-2005, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to mention that I keep this memmed for groups and even when soloing.  For that matter...its especially handy when soloing.  I use track all the time refelxively and every so often see a named up.  With this spell it is quite possible to &quot;step up&quot; a level of the mobs that you can solo.  Summoners in NC really brought this home to me, I had found the poisonous murk there extremely difficult to solo.  The major problem was that if/ when root broke getting it reestablished wasnt possible.  Now I can pop this spell and renew root while living to tell the tale  : )<br />
<br />
This is another second chance spell for us.  It can let us reeastablish control of the fight on the fly and recover from an ooops.<br />

I too thought it was garbage. 20 minutes later in a Creator mission it saved me. So its a permanent resident in my 9th spell slot and used for those &quot;D'oh, did I really cast that early on that mob&quot; moments. Also, dont wait too long to pop it as it wont save you at less than a certain % of health.</div></div><hr />
