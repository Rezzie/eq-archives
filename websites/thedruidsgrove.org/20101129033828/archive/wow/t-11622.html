Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
    * Fixed the credits to display properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">03-07-2007, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition, there was a Blizzard reply explaining the hotfix changes.<br />
<br />
Additional explanation for these fixes and information on Armor:<br />
<br />
Weve taken a close look at constructive feedback provided on our Druid Bear changes, and are hotfixing the following changes today:<br />
<br />
1. Lacerate will now do a small amount of direct damage to the target. This means it will generate threat rather than an immune message when used on bleed-immune creatures. However, bleed-immune creatures will still not receive the debuff from Lacerate. This should address concerns about Druids being able to tank in specific bleed-immune encounters.<br />
<br />
2. Mangle (Bear) now generates 50% bonus threat on its damage. We realized that in reducing Mangle damage, we made it less useful as a snap aggro tool. This threat bonus moves it back up to almost where it was before the 2.0.10 changes.<br />
<br />
In addition, we examined concerns about the best Feral Druid armor pieces being outdoor world quest rewards, and Druids feeling their tanking ability would not scale with better gear. We are adjusting superior and epic leather pieces designed to be used by Bear Druids and increasing the armor on many of those items, particularly raid sets. These changes, however, will not show up until patch 2.1.0.<br />

I would have liked some set bonus fixes as well, all the set bonuses buff our &quot;resto&quot; talents and brethern. I want to see more mitigation and attack power buffs in addition to increased armor, stamina and agi.</div></div><hr />
