But seeing that I don't have mangle or lacerate.  How do I tank with just Maul, Swipe, Demo, Enrage, Growl and FFF?  Should I avoid Maul even on single targets?<br />
<br />
During solo PvE quests with multiple mobs, should I Maul one mob down at a time, or use swipe?  Which has rage efficiency in this scenario?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When doing solo quests with 2 or more mobs you really should have no rage issues and can use Maul all the time. You should focus on one target and try to CC the other(s) - root them, stun them, whatever.<br />
<br />
I often started in Cat Form and, out of stealth, built up 5 CP on one mob, Maim, shift out, throw some heals, go to Bear, finish them. But that only works when they do not hit hard.</div></div><hr />
