<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gizmog</div><div class="date">07-04-2006, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 nights ago i killed Furitive Figure in S. Qeynos and looted &quot;a hasty note&quot;. Next day I went to S Karana and the 12:00a.m. Druid Ring event started. I agroed the 3 targetable necros with one cast of Bonds of Tunare and started snaring, rooting and dotting the mobs and their pets. Eventualy i was able to seperate the 3 with root and individually dot and rot them. Killed Tehana and Rendolf and looted crystal fragments but Finnelzi had poofed. I can't get the event to pop. I have been there 5 times at 12:00 am game time  and they just won't spawn. I still have the hasty note. I went back to Qeynos and killed the Furitive Figure again but he did not have any loot. I planned to destroy old note and get new one but he didnt have one to loot. If I destroy the hasty note i have first will he drop a new one for me? and would a new note respawn the event? I would hate to be bugged and unable to finish the quest. Please help me get past this hump</div></div><hr />

It is likely as Galain suggests that they won't spawn if you have crystals from one of them.  From my experience, you do not need to re-kill the furtive figure and get a new hasty note, the old one will work just fine.</div></div><hr />
