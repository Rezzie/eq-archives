<br />
(12-09) 10:37 PST SAN JOSE -- A San Francisco woman who advertised herself as a psychic has been sentenced to two months in jail for bilking a love-sick customer out of $108,000 and talking her into buying her a sports car in exchange for purifying her of evil spirits, Santa Clara County authorities said today.<br />
<br />
Lisa Miller, 27, of San Francisco victimized a woman who &quot;sought her out because she was in love with a fellow who was not returning her affection,&quot; said Deputy District Attorney Cherie Bourlard. The woman contacted Miller in 2005 after seeing a newspaper ad that offered a $10 reading.<br />
<br />
Miller convinced the woman that she was cursed and needed &quot;spiritual cleansing,&quot; authorities said. The woman gave Miller $108,000 from her checking, savings and retirement accounts as well as cash, jewelry and gift cards. She also financed a Corvette for Miller, authorities said.http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/charity/2008-10-07-charity-faith_N.htmGiving USA, a non-profit foundation that studies philanthropy in the United States, in its 2008 report found 33.4% of estimated total giving, $103.32 billion, went to houses of worship and denominational organizations in 2007.So when churches bilk Americans to the tune of over $100 billion a year for spiritual cleansing, it's not only tolerated, but heavily subsidized by my earnings.<br />
<br />
But when a &quot;fortune teller&quot; does the same thing, she goes to jail.<br />
<br />
I like the fortune teller scenario better, and think it should be applied to all the con artists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a hierarchy of delusions.  If you exploit those who hold to a certain set of delusions you can get tax free money.  If you exploit those who hold a lesser respected set of delusions you go to jail.<br />
<br />
I think if I were the fortune teller's lawyer I'd be thinking &quot;Supreme Court&quot;.  Not that they're likely to get a fair hearing in today's SCOTUS.</div></div><hr />
