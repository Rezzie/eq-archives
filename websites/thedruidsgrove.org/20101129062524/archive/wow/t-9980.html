So when it comes to PvP I'm WAAAAAY behind the curve.  <br />
<br />
It obviously takes a different approach than PvE, and getting bettern eqiup would definitely help me out, but what are some basic strategies?<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for tips against different classes or anything like that, just a general approach to PvP that I can build on myself as...well...yeah I suck...badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Alot of your approach really depends on how you want to play. Do you play &quot;Red = Dead&quot; or do you only attack when attacked? Do you only attack when its a fair fight or do you attack people when they are fighting mobs or half dead or sitting and drinking ect. ect. ? Do you kill people lower level than you? Do you solo alot or run with a group most of the time?<br />
<br />
 Other than those basic self guidelines it really boils down to what class you are facing and what the situation is. In my opinion you really have to be able to think quick on your feet, fight or run, because usually he who hesitates ends up face down in the dirt.</div></div><hr />

Here's one thing though....if you are feral and in a form....don't forget to pop out every now and then for a heal...and don't just stay in one form all the time.</div></div><hr />
