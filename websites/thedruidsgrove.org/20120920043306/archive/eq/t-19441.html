<br />
 I have all the aa for Dots: maxing the amount and frequency of crits.<br />
But I would like to increase my dps some ( I already have all the mana pool, regen, and healing aa: around 1600 aa atm, all def aa too. )<br />
So what do you all recommend?  Max storm strike? or the boo boo pet?<br />
Currently I have storm strike 2, and it does like 960hp damage, only 100 more than level 1, 7 aa for 100hp more damage, pffft.<br />
<br />
Also, my dps parser put my dot dps at around 400 to 500 before i got the aa. now its about 900 to 1k tops.  That is nice, and frequently because i have to heal my war, i cant take the time to cast these long casting nukes, but, for any out there that have maxed the nuking aa, how does that dps compare?  Any parses?<br />
<br />
Any other ideas for boosting my dps a little?  When 2 boxing my dru and war, every little bit of dps helps me take down a named before def disc wears off and im forced to spam heal.</div></div><hr />

I have a tad more aa's than you and am geared mostly in POR stuff but often get crits in the 3k area and sometimes double crits.<br />
When appropriate I link storm strike to my right turn key so it casts automatically as it refreshes.<br />
 <br />
I think the key to more damage is going to be focus effects from your gear. Cultural armor is pretty good stuff if you can get a last blood or better drop and make a Pyromancer aug for 50% damage boost. I think last blood can be grouped now, bazu blood for sure.<br />
 <br />
I've found no use at all for the bear except for a hug.<br />

It can hit for over 700 and double attack when maxed. It can last awhile too. Storm strike, however, offers more utility and will be higher dps if used correctly. It can be used for pulling. Maxed, with a double crit, can do about 6k.<br />
 <br />
As for more dps, the focus has the 2nd largest effect on dps, but the most immediate impact. AA's have the largest impact on dps, but you need to max them and that takes awhile. You have to weigh the focus degradation vs. the focus strength.<br />
 <br />
For parses, I can hit 1.8k dps with only nukes on raid bosses 2.5k average on trash. With DoTs alone I can hit about the same, but I can go higher if I add nukes when possible, but I end up getting agro if I do that. All my nuke and DoT aa's are maxed out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fuinniuil</div><div class="date">08-06-2009, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks sorrian, I find it interesting that your dot dps and nuke dps are around the same with both maxed out.  Do you have your aggro reducing aa maxed also?  Seems that dots are so much more mana efficient that maxing them alone would work very well.<br />
<br />
I already have the best focus items that are one groupable i believe ( comes with full sod t5 armor i believe ).  So focus items arent the question, its what aa to get.<br />
<br />
I think I'll work on storm strike first, and the boo boo pet next.<br />
<br />
So without double crits, what does storm strike hit for?  mine at level 2 is around 960.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorrian</div><div class="date">08-07-2009, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DoT dps is really dependent on how many, and of what kind, you stack. So it can vary wildy depending on your lineup. Yes they are maxed as I have nearly 3700 aa's now.<br />
 <br />
I think storm strike hits for a little over 1300 for the single hit, which can crit for about 3k with the aa's to increase crit damage. With the double hit I believe it's another 1k hit and crits for like 2300 I think. I am not completely positive on the exact numbers because, after 3k aa's you stop paying attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever buy the aa under special, that buy you a one time use function, i think they are called glyph?  Any of them help much? ( could buy and use on an extra hard named I imagine ).</div></div><hr />
