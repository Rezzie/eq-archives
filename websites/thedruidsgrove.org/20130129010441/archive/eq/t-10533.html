<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is Tunare's Renewal at level 58 our Complete Heal spell? I saw on a website it only heals for 75%. I thought at level 58 we get a Complete Heal, like a 100% heal, like Clerics.<br />
Does anyone know what the Complete Heal spell is called, is it Tunare's Renewal? If not....why isn't Complete Heal listed on these websites?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its Tunare's Renewal.  It's not a real CH, people just refer to it that way.  That and Karana's Renewal (higher level version of the same thing) are the only CH-type spells we get, and neither heal 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iilane SalAlur</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, Tunare's Renewal and Karana's Renewal are our &quot;complete&quot; heal spells, except they only heal up to 75% of the hitpoints or 3k/5k, whichever is lower. Some of us have jokingly called them our iCH or InComplete Heal spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">01-04-2005, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are no &quot;complete&quot; heals.  Clerics can heal up to 7500 with &quot;Complete Healing&quot;.  Druids can heal up to 2925 (Tunare's Renewal / level 58) or 4680 (Karana's Renewal / level 64), up to a maximum of 75% of the target's hit points.  The druid percentage limitation is only relevant if the target has less than 3,900 hp (for Tunare's Renewal) or 6,240 hp (for Karana's Renewal), almost never the case today.<br />
<br />
Therefore both clerics and druids have a &quot;big 10 second heal,&quot; it's just that clerics can heal more in one shot and the cleric spell is much more mana efficient.</div></div><hr />

Odd, I've seen 16.5k warriors go from negative to 100% hp with 1 heal before=)<br />
 <br />
HA effects all heals from any class, but HG only effects cleric CH.  <br />
 <br />
with HA 6 , my KR lands for 5990 -- but Ancient Chloro only costs 50 more mana (well actully less than KR after foci get filtered in) and can crit for 8500.<br />
 <br />
The time where druids are, imo, even with clerics in healpower are right at lvl 58 when we get the CH.  When I first started using TR to main heal it was in PoD, and there were very few cases when it wasnt powerful enough to handle the job.  Since it was the same mana cost as a cleric CH, i was more or less equal to one.  I also used TR through early BoT grouping etc.  Back when i used to main heal elems (before i had elem gear) i would use TR and KR, TR the tank as the mob came into camp, and cap em off after mob was dead -- and KR inbetween.</div></div><hr />

Ancient Chlorobon, max heal focus, and max crit aa's changed that, plus bigger tanks taking more damage. Lower cast time + chance of crit make Chlorobon a more useful heal for me. I'd have liked to see an upgrade to KR for sustained healing, something that would be as effective at 70 in the new expansion as KR was at 64 in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teialiscious</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm main healing an experience group I simply can't hang with Ancient Chlorobon - KR still rules with me for that. I haven't touched KR in ages on a raid though - in fact I booted it off of my staple spell list and replaced with Sylvan Infusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still find much more mana efficent to use KR, but Yeriaie does happen to be superiorly geared compared to me =p.  I just find it hard to keep rythym w/o KR.  I've main heals pretty gimp warriors (12k buffed, 0% shielding) in rifts, non-stop pulling, w/o any major problems using  KR so it cant be too bad heh.  <br />
 <br />
Like Teia mentioned, im finding KR less and less useful in raid situations, but i still mem it.  I usually cast it once or twice per raid nowadays, but once in a blue moon i keep someone alive by chaining it. IE Last night me and some guildies helped a smaller guild kill agnarr and after their warrior died i was able to keep our warrior up with KR while their heal rot switched targets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tubben</div><div class="date">01-05-2005, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never use KR, really, never.<br />
<br />
I use TR in XP Groups, i use TR on Raids.<br />
<br />
I used TR last Anguish fight where i healed one of our tanks on an Harrier add.<br />
<br />
I still use SI instead of Chloroborn just because of my Gaelins Gauntlets.<br />
<br />
I just chaincast TR, and if needed i use one SI every 2-3 TR's if needed.<br />
<br />
This way my TR allways land for full, while my KR pretty often DONT land for full hp's.<br />
<br />
So i heal 3.7K every 13 seconds if needed. <br />
<br />
I tried KR a few times, but it didnt cut it for me, i allways got mana problems using KR.<br />
<br />
IMHO, and we all know it will never happen, Sony should have introduced an 70 Ancient iCH for like 600 mana and 7.5K hps. PLUS let them crit. <br />
<br />
No one who's able to get Ancient Runes use CH chains on raids anyway ;P</div></div><hr />
