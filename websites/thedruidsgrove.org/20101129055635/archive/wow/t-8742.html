<br />
When's a good lvl to start participating in some pvp on a pve server?  <br />
<br />
Of course the first thought would be &quot;why don't you just move to a pvp server?&quot; but that isn't what I'm looking for 'specially after what I hear has been going on after the new pvp honour system patch (&quot;mmm... fresh meat!&quot;).  I have an old school computer that wouldn't survive any of the large raids but back when I was lvl 25-30 in Ashenvale, everytime I hear its being attacked (like every half an hour..) I'd think that I can't wait till I get big enough to be able help defend.  Now that I'm 41, I find that Horde raiders still have lvl ??'s.  Being a repeat one hit kill just isn't my cup o' tea.. <br />
<br />
...and so Ashenvale get's wiped out once again and the channels are filled with &quot;you all should be defending the town instead of sitting at the side watching the show! &amp;*@#$#&quot;<br />
<br />
..thoughts?<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more question... <br />
What are some primary differences between a raid on an instance, raiding/defending a town or just working on an instance (besides the obvious).  I think the numbers in the groups involved is part of it, but what else?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But to realistically contribute, it depends on what you're up against, but as most PvP is predominantly 60's right now, around level 50 you can expect to do some damage, though you'll miss a lot.<br />
<br />
But hey, you can work on and take out their peons.</div></div><hr />

In my 40's I didn't so much as lift a finger to kill even lower level horde (I'm on a PvP server).  Yeah, it isn't until you hit 50, that you will even start to do some small noticable dmg, but 55+ You are technically dangerous to even level 60's giving the proper setting, especially if they are soft targets and you know what you are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe.. take out the peons..  <br />
<br />
Occasionaly there will be some players around your own level.  You can try your luck at them but you can expect some level 60 to throw a fireball at you and you'll find yourself making out with the spirit healer.</div></div><hr />

I first started raidin at lvl 13.... needless to say I didnt do much dmg, but back in the day the servers(EU) were young and there weren't many high lvl's.. I've been participatin in raids and group pvp on a regular basis ever since(now 49, hit 50 this weekend I hope), and I must say that although it was been fun, it wasnt untill I hit my 40's I really started to take ppl down... I consider myself good in group/raid pvp(don't ask me about my 1 on 1 skills), but it depends on what lvl the ones u are facing are....<br />
<br />
I'd say ur the right lvl to start join raids and stuff, but then again that depends on the population of ur server.... on my server i see lvl 60's now and again, but they are not common.... I'd say the late 40's and early 50's are more represented here, thus leaving me in the middle of the action....<br />
<br />
Ps: i also play on a Pve server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phalanx_era</div><div class="date">04-29-2005, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe Drunken Dragon.. *thinks back when servers were young and imagines a bunch of school boys/girls lvl 10-15s raiding Darnassus/Stormwind/Ironforge etc..* &quot;FOR THE HORDE!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks all for the input! :)<br />
<br />
I think until I get closer to 50, I'll be the annoying (relatively) lowbie running at the sidelines with drive-by heals, roots, sleeps (for pets), and moonfires (for totems - Sorry Horde, I'm part of Club Alliance) for town raids/defends.<br />
<br />
So what are some (relatively) low lvl raid instances that lvl 40s can start participating in? Onyxia and Scholo are lvl 60's but I'm sure there are lower ones?</div></div><hr />

At lvl 23 my feral druid took out a grp of 3 (25 druid, 22 warrior, 23 rogue) solo... naturally I waited stealthed till they had a bad pull then jumped thier druid, smacked the rogue and left the warrior running for his life... which i promptly rooted and let the mobs finish. <br />
<br />
At lower lvls expect to die alot, it'll prepare you for the real PvP. I was so green at first that when I jumped my first horde my fingers were literally shaking so much I hit the wrong keys, now I'm alil more calm during battles able to think clearer. Practice, Practice, Practice. Even ?? can teach you how to survive via root and runs. <br />
<br />
Most of all have a blast and die laughing and in a blaze of glory  :gunfight:</div></div><hr />

Often u will find players down to 30-35 there...</div></div><hr />

Sure I could go flag myself, then watch helplessly as the alliance all gathered around me untill they had 4 to 1 odds and ganked me. I also wasn't too into the idea of joining a pvp raiding party with so many people that my entire computer lags to death from all the action going on at once.  IMHO pvp servers are the only place to find great pvp when your below lvl 60. Sure you have to deal with the occasional high level ganking you, but I think it's a small price to pay for all the encounters you have with players who are your level :D</div></div><hr />

I've been raidin with him since lvl 10 hehe... Needless to say my lvling is goin slow.... Although I'm only lvl 20 I find that Shammy's in lower lvls are very good in pvp... I'll engage in anyone within 5lvs of me and I'd say I got a 70-30% success rate... And I agree, the satisifaction of fighting ONE at the same lvl is beyond much of the pvp action I get from my pve chars;-)</div></div><hr />

 I hear ya.. I think I'm in your position right before you left pve for a pvp server.  Lag can be such a problem on my comp but big kudos to Blizzard for making a game that runs as well as it does on it though (P3, &lt;1GHz, integrated mem vid-card, 512Mb ram).  Looks like I should invest in a pvp alt soon :D</div></div><hr />
