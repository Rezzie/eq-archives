For leveling up effectively id say feral will most likely be the best laternative. Its good dps, its good survivability and its not manadependant.<br />
Balance might be good, and even very fun as leveling, but u are manadependant and thus u will find urself stopping up for a manabreak or switching to feral for a while until mana has regened.<br />
<br />
Its mostly a matter of what u prefer, but for leveling ultrafast i dont think any specs can beat feral.</div></div><hr />

If you did, you would end up using a lot of cloth which would make you kinda squishy. The itemization does imporve a bit @ level 60ish so from level 60-70 leveling moonkin might be viable (even without running raid instances)</div></div><hr />

<br />
i know the benefits of stamina, intelligence, and agility...<br />
<br />
what are the benefits of spirit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">01-31-2007, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">spirit is for mana regen. very useful for balance and resto spec. u can be a leather wearing, high ac moonkin with decent spelldmg/crit, or a cloth wearing, low ac moonkin with high spelldmg/crit. cloth is better for pve, and leather is better for pvp, imho.<br />
<br />
balance druids has a very different play style than feral druids. i'm currently balance spec'd, and as much as i luv dps'ing with spells, and off-healing at the same time, i miss some of the benefits of being a feral druid.<br />
<br />
what i miss about feral...<br />
<br />
1. when party needs an off-tank, i can't really do it that well as a balance druid.<br />
<br />
2. i don't have to carry a ton of drinks around, because i can't &quot;run out&quot; of mana for dps.<br />
<br />
3. when farming/soloing as moonkin, i don't have track humanoids on, so i have to pan around a lot for alliance.<br />
<br />
4. i can't do the Swipe chain, and take out 3-4 mobs of my own level... solo.<br />
<br />
5. all those lvl70 feral weapons are geared towards feral druids, with very little to no spelldmg on them. stuck with end of dreams for now.</div></div><hr />

Your question is a perfect example.  What is your goal?  Level as quickly as possible with no preference as to how you get to end game?  If so, Feral spec would be the most efficient for you.  Less down time due to less use of mana.  Of course, gear is very important no matter what spec you are.  However, there are those of us (myself included) that want more out of the game than getting to level 60 (now 70) as fast as possible.  I was feral until I reached 40 and then went Moonkin and never looked back.  As a balance druid, I can still main heal (with my healing gear) and drop huge nukes (up to 2700+ starfire crits).  That is my preferred style and I'm quite happy with that.  There are other druids I play with that are the exaxt opposite and prefer the feral tree.  It's all about style.  Which style do you prefer...</div></div><hr />

In the outlands, you can easily find and use all leather and have 400+ spell damage.  Gearing for balance in 'the old world' was much more difficult, if you wanted leather.  For me, BC has doubled the balance spec potential.</div></div><hr />
