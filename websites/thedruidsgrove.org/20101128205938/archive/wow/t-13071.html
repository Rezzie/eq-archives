SO - before wotlk, it was basically common knowledge that by the time you reach 70, Rake was not energy efficient for the amount of damage, and many people including myself avoided using it almost entirely (with a couple exceptions like rogues in pvp, etc...)<br />
<br />
But now, Rake seems to be mentioned quite a bit as a vital attack, to always keep up and active.  What changed?  I'm guessing I need to be moving this back onto my primary bar, but want to totally understand why.    Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For questing, I open with Rake (after FFF).  For group PvE, your goal should be to keep Rake up at all times, along with Savage Roar, Mangle Debuff and Rip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also just noticed the bit about defense being worthless with Survival of the Fittest changes (which I neglected to spec at all - respec is first order of business upon next login)...  Sitting down and &quot;doing research&quot; just seems like such a drag when you don't have a ton of time, and actually want to just &quot;play&quot; a game.   but this is wow, i shoulda known better.   hahaha<br />
<br />
Looking forward to savage roar.  that one sounds swell.</div></div><hr />

You still get dodge from it.  The anti-crit portion is wasted (though I guess it might help in PvP).</div></div><hr />
