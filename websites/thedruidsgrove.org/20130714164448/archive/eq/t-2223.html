You will find better info on this with searches. Many detailed posts, including some lowbies who quad at pre-34, or try to.<br />
<br />
The best bet is get to level 34 and quad kite with lightning blast. You will be a kid in a candy store in Iceclad Ocean killing the cougers and wolves while avoiding adds.<br />
<br />
Then some orcs and animals in the Easter Waste. When you can manage it Ulthorks in Eastern Waste will bring you some plat and good expericence.</div></div><hr />

Most of us, who have played for 2+ years figued out this for ourselves. Or had a more experienced druid to fall back on.<br />
+ this is a subject on any druid discussion you go look at.<br />
<br />
That being said, cause i am a nice guy<br />
<br />
34- 40 Iceclad Ocean and Eastern Waste. Cougars, Ulthorks.<br />
<br />
42- 52 ish. Tim deep, Spirocs <br />
<br />
52-56 Cobalt scar, CoV faction required. Wyverns. Pull them down to beach and kill.<br />
<br />
56-60 Tim Deep, Raptors.<br />
<br />
HOW TO QUAD KITE.<br />
<br />
Find a mob that you want to kill in a outdoor area.<br />
<br />
Make sure you always have Sow or SoE up at all times.<br />
<br />
Load your quadding spell, Some variation at all times of lighting blast.<br />
<br />
Snare the mob in a outdoor area with little to no &quot;roamers&quot;<br />
<br />
Go get another mob<br />
Repeat.<br />
<br />
When you get 4, Run in a big Circle till it looks like they are all on top of each other.<br />
<br />
Run to maxx casting range.&quot; For me i count to 8 seconds&quot;<br />
<br />
NUKE<br />
<br />
Run 8 more seconds.<br />
<br />
NUKE.<br />
<br />
Repeat till dead.<br />
<br />
Sit and med when LOM, With Kei this is not a problem.<br />
<br />
Thats about it, basic strategy, that i use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have better luck with search than I do.<br />
<br />
It is broken for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Watching someone do it really is a good idea, to actually learn how to do it.<br />
<br />
There are enough quadders around the planet and moon and planes, that finding someone to watch should not be that hard, these days.<br />
<br />
I stopped quadding some time ago, so I am probably not a great help in that department.<br />
<br />
Mobflation curve just got too inefficient for me, thats's all.</div></div><hr />

All of the above and you couldn't even get pointed in the right direction.  *shakes head*<br />
<br />
Here's a older &quot;How to Quad Kite&quot; guide.<br />

<br />
Keep in mind that this is all pre-PoP.  You shouldn't attempt quadding in PoP, however, until you get some practice.<br />
<br />
These posts are in the Archive.   I know the search function doesn't work, but the topics there are pretty self explanatory.  Take a look through, and I think many of the more basic questions can be answered.</div></div><hr />
