<br />
Truthfully, I can't always tell which is better for me when I compare my present blue gear with some of these drops.  I've noticed that blue gear always has a higher level of armour, but some green gear kicks when it comes to other stats....<br />
<br />
So, is Blue always better than Green?</div></div><hr />

Most blue items have a higher &quot;item level&quot; than a similar level green.  Which means its attributes are &quot;better&quot; in Blizzard's eyes.  However, if you find a green with +30 STR and a Blue with +25STR and +30SPR, I'd keep the green.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, I think Blizzard gets a bunch of drunk folks together when they design items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While it is usually the case where Orange &gt; Purple &gt; Blue &gt; Green, it is not ALWAYS the case.<br />
<br />
Take this list of belts that is &quot;rated&quot; in terms of how good it is for tanking.  Notice there are greens that out perform blues and purples.  <br />
<br />
In the long run you can generalize that Purple &gt; Blue &gt; Green, but just remember to pay attention to the stats, b/c it isn't ALWAYS the case :)</div></div><hr />
