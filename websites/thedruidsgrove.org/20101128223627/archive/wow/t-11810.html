<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduan</div><div class="date">06-02-2007, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok need some advice.  I finally made my Heavy Clefthoof set and now I am wondering what gems I should put in the set.  I do have LW so I get the slight bonus from the set.<br />
<br />
My armory profile is http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Blackrock&amp;n=Zulluu<br />
<br />
Not sure if it updated when I logged out in my bear gear but here is a bit of info if need be.  Will log again later tonight in bear gear.<br />
<br />
In Dire Bear form<br />
<br />
Def=388<br />
AR=18137<br />
Dodge=19.29%<br />
HP=11208<br />
<br />
This is all unbuffed and I am a new druid so I know I have a good way to upgrade but slowly getting my items up to a decent set.<br />
<br />
Any and all help/suggestion is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also any advice on what item/trinket etc I should focus on upgrading asap would be great...seems I have having issues getting my Def up to the 415 that I need for crit defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">06-02-2007, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">defiantly go with the 4def/6sta one in the yellow slots and 12sta ones in the blues...once you get your defense over 415 and can swap out the yellows for just the 12 sta ones <br />
<br />
Looks like you logged out in cat form stuff...or i would give you some more easy suggestions for def items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduan</div><div class="date">06-02-2007, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks will try those out.  I just logged out for the night and was in bear gear again but don't look like armory is updating.  So hopefully over night it will reset if not I will just list my gear here slot by slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kebster</div><div class="date">06-02-2007, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Head - doesnt looked socketed yet.  Defiantly put a 4def/6sta in it, or just the lesser cheap one 3def/4sta, if you can get a stylish purple hat, you will be set for a while.<br />
<br />
Neck - work on your Cenarion Expedition rep a little more and get revered, and you can buy this http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29173 neck its excellent to use till you can get a better purple.<br />
<br />
Cloak - quite a few different tanking cloaks out there, for defense if you still need it I beleive I used the one from Black Morass for the longest time, then switched to the armor/sta one from Mechinar once my def was high<br />
<br />
Chest - socket that puppy and you are good to go<br />
<br />
Bracer - you are set for a while, maybe try and get +sta on it<br />
<br />
Gloves - if you havent done the quest for the Verdant gloves in Shadowmoon, try to hit up that line, or if you are good at getting instance runs, I personally like the Wastewalkers gloves from the last guy in Shattered Halls, put 2 +12 sta gems in them and you have insane stamina on just gloves<br />
<br />
Belt - I actualy still use this one as well, trying to get that epic Tree Mender one in heroics though<br />
<br />
Legs - just need socketed<br />
<br />
Boots - just need socketed<br />
<br />
Rings - run Old Hillsbrad a few times, the first guy drops a decent armor/def/sta ring and it's generally disenchanted, and it's not unique.<br />
<br />
Trinkets - it's up to the player what they do here.  I used a couple +def trinkets till I was up above 415, now I mix in dps/sta trinkets depending what and where I am tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anduan</div><div class="date">06-02-2007, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah thanks a lot will take that into account and work on that.<br />
<br />
I am just starting to do instances tbh.  I basically soloed my way to 70 and only did to instance's run and never did either go all the way through.  But now that I am in a guild, only druid atm, they are doing runs with me so that I can get the hang of tanking with them.  Just be hesitant to do runs as I am new to druid and not use to tanking.<br />
<br />
I been meaning to socket the items (other then the clefthoof of course but was unsure and did not want to waste money/gems in not knowing.<br />
<br />
Oh and on the neck I am working on a quest line that gives me this... http://www.thottbot.com/i29336  then once I have that I will most likely work on kitty gear a bit more as well but been focusing on tanking items so that I can start doing more runs for rep and such.</div></div><hr />
