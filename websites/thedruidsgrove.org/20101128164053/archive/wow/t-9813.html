<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">12-30-2005, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of the 3.0.8 patch, this quest is optional.  You can still do it if you'd like, or you can learn Aquatic Form from any druid trainer at level 16.<br />
<br />
The Horde aquatic form quest is obtainable once you hit level 16. It begins with Turak Runetotem, at the Elder Rise in Thunder Bluff.  (He's marked on the Thunder Bluff map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=150) attached to this post.)  Turak sends you back to Moonglade, to talk to Dendrite Starblaze again.  Dendrite sends you to find a shrine bauble from the bottom of Lake Elune'ara -- be ready before accepting this part, as it has a 30 minute time limit.  The bauble looks a bit like a wooden block (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=152), and you'll need to swim around beneath the surface of the lake to find it.<br />
<br />
After you find the bauble, you have 5 minutes to take it to the Shrine of Remulos, just a bit west of the lake.  You'll know you're there when you see Keeper Remulos and four arch type structures.  (36,41 if you're using a map addon, or see the Moonglade map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=151)).  Use the shrine bauble at the shrine, then talk to Tajarri, who is merely a few feet away.  Tajarri will send you to find the two halves of the Pendant of the Sea Lion.  You can talk to the flight masters in Nighthaven for clues, but it's not necessary.<br />
<br />
The first, and trickier part, the Half Pendant of Aquatic Endurance, is off the western coast of Silverpine Forest.  From Orgrimmar, take the zeppelin to Tirisfal Glades, then run southwest to Silverpine.  In Silverpine, follow the road to the Sepulcher (might as well grab the flight point since you're close), then head slightly north of the Sepulcher and west to the wrecked boat at the shore.  Head west from the boat a bit, then dive down just before the fatigue area.  You should find a bubbly fissure to catch your breath, and the chest containing the half pendant is right next to it.  (29,29, or see the Silverpine map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=149).)<br />
<br />
If your hearthstone is up, now might be a good time to use it. ;)  The Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility is in the Barrens at the Sludge Fens.  Head north from the Crossroads, then east to the Fen -- the half pendant is in the murky lake, and you'll probably have to fight some Venture Co. to reach it.  (It's at 56,8, or see the blue dot on the Barrens map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=148).)<br />
<br />
Now that you have both halves, you can just teleport back to Moonglade.  Head back to the Shrine of Remulos, and use one of the halves to rejoin the pendant.  Show the completed pendant to Dendrite, and he'll send you back to Turak in Thunder Bluff.  Turak will teach you aquatic form, and give you an Aquarius Belt (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=16608), a nice item for its level.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, and go scare some people with your carnivorous seal form!</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the sludge fen I had to kill a few level 16/17 venture company goblins to get into the sludge fen pool itself.<br />
<br />
Once in there i noticed around the &quot;Strange lockbox&quot; that contains the Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility that there was a level 19 (silver elite/rare) Sludge beast, however I was able to recover the half pendant without being noticed.<br />
<br />
I did however decide to kill the Sludge beast, I found that by pulling using wrath and then moonfire a few times before going into bear form i was a good match for the beast and managed to take it, I got two green items (a bonus as i'[m an enchanter, gave me 10 strange dust).</div></div><hr />

There are mountains blocking the way. I had to go to Undercity first.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's not possible, it's that I couldn't find a way to get there, after 1h30min trying to climb every little mountain there is. (ok, ok, laugh at me, I'm such a noob.)</div></div><hr />
