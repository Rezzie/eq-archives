<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">09-19-2008, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question #1:<br />
<br />
After getting my healy mace, I started saving my badges again.  Hording them, actually (I have about 170) because I really have a hard time parting with them (except for the mace, of course, which was an obvious necessity).<br />
<br />
Here is my link:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Misha&amp;n=Magellan<br />
<br />
With the expansion coming out, should I use up my badges now?  Or, can I take them with me into the expansion and use towards &quot;future&quot; gear?<br />
<br />
Question #2:<br />
<br />
I have a fairly decent feral offset (Kara off-set drops, more or less).  Is it true that with the expansion we will be allowed to be &quot;dual-specced&quot;?  Because, if that's the case, I would use the above badges towards replacing some of my lesser Feral gear.  Hello Kitty!   <br />
<br />
Question #3:<br />
<br />
I was told to hold off making my Shadoweave Set for my sPriest because of the new release. Why?  Are the mats gonna change?  Is there gonna be a better set available?  Better than - dare I say it? - the S-Weave set? <br />
<br />
I think that's it.  I've got more...but unless you all have about a week on your hands to answer my endless questions, I'll hold back from asking and find out for myself by living and learning. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
#2 -- that has not been confirmed and I sort of think they will not be doing it as the Heirloom items seem to encourage alts which is in direct conflict with dual-specs (IMO)<br />
<br />
#3 -- Not sure, but I suspect there is &quot;just as good&quot; stuff avaiable in the first zone or 2 of the LK.  You'll have to look around at LK gear to decide if it is worth the wait or not.  I do know that Feral (cat and bear) high-end badge gear and T4 items seem to be comparable to lvl 74-76 items (depending on slot).</div></div><hr />

<br />
- There is talk about &quot;dual specs&quot; but nothing has been implemented yet, so who knows when that will come to be.<br />
<br />
- there will be better gear than the shadow-weave, if you have the mats, make it now.  It will last you a while into WotLK.  Of course there is always better stuff to come, but if you go with that mentality why get anything if there's something better yet still?<br />
<br />
And feel free to ask more questions =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the idea.<br />
<br />
it allows people who for example like to do a chunk of pvp when not raiding to not have to keep forking out cash to spec to pvp for a few hours before dashing off to re-spec ahead of a guild raid.<br />
<br />
and it helps smaller guilds where people are called upon to perhaps not always be a healer or be a tank ?<br />
<br />
why should be not be able to respec whenever we want to anyways ?  why did Blizz make us pay an ever increasing amount to respec ?<br />
<br />
its not as if we can have all the talents as u mention War by doing this - it simply means we can choose if we would like to be a tank for a while due to a guildie tank going on holiday or being ill etc etc<br />
<br />
i'd be up for them to simply remove any associated cost with respeccing so we can choose what build we have and when to suit the gameplay we want / guild needs ?<br />
<br />
i've seen Blue mentions of dual spec and i'm sure it said its going to happen BUT its going to be a patch sometime after Wrath is released so i guess that means early 2009 to give Wrath time to settle ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't mean you can use 2 specs at the same time... it allows you to switch without having to visit a trainer or pay for it. This is great to switch between your PvE and PvP build, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-09-2008, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its ideal for raiding too... some times you need say three tanks for one fight and after that you don't need another tank.  By allowing someone to just swap specs and rearrange their gear, you avoid having to send someone out and bring a different character in.  All the fire mages don't have to swear and be ineffective when the boss has fire immunity.  They swap to their alternate spec and just start blasting away.  There are lots of benefits.  <br />
<br />
I like having to choose a spec too.  The dual spec is great because you can sample a secondary spec without dumping your favorite one too.  You can try a different one to test out if it ups your DPS without having to remove you're favorite one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would spend all the badges on primal nether and AH them while you can still get good gold for them!  after the expansion the badges will be next to worthless, so use them now!!!!<br />
<br />
BTW, Epic gems are pretty worthless on my server now, as the new green gems in the expansion are pretty much equal to the current epic ones.</div></div><hr />

My server has already worn that out... The market has been FLOODED with Primal Nethers and they're going for roughly 10G on the AH :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server the same thing. But i intend to use that fact in order to built some useful things which last me a while in WotlK.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
I have now 6 nethercleft-leg armor on my bank, just because i could make them for around 200 gold and i can use them on every item until the 80 epics. And i dont have to think about it ;-D<br />
<br />
Same goes for kitty-gear: 8 nethercobra-leg-armor extremly cheap mats, 1 cost me about 20g to make (i did farm the scales myself though)<br />
<br />
And if i replace them or if they get useless, so what.<br />
300g gone...oohhh my god ;-D</div></div><hr />
