<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In Greater Feydark, near the Wizard spires, are 2 bards.  Talking to them results in this:<br />
<br />
[Fri May 16 21:06:41 2003] You say, 'Hail, Stefan Marsinger'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:06:42 2003] Stefan Marsinger says 'Salutations, my name is Stefan Marsinger. My sister Seana and I are here on quite a mission for the League of Antonican Bards as well as our own interests.'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:06:45 2003] You say, 'Hail, Seana Marsinger'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:06:45 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Hello, my name is Seana Marsinger. I am here representing my loyalty to the League of Antonican Bards. It matters not to me whether you support the League or loathe it propaganda is not my objective. Everyone must find their own truths in this life path, so says Quellious. To business then, are you [familiar with the Plane of Hate?]'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:06:53 2003] You say, 'I am familiar with the plane of hate.'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:06:53 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Good, I need someone that has a bit of an eye for how things should look up there. My brother and I have been studying Innoruuk and his intricate dealings for years. Being raised in New Tanaan may lend us certain neutrality towards all people, yet the values our parents have instilled in us do not allow us to let him go unwatched. In fact, I have begun to believe that my paranoia may prove useful not only to the League, but to the Citizens of Tranquility and New Tanaan itself as well. We have received a simple [piece of intelligence] that may conceivably upset the entire balance of the Pantheon and have most dire repercussions here in Norrath.'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:08 2003] You say, 'What piece of intelligence?'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:08 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'An old friend of our father's in Qeynos, Jusean Evanesque, has been very busy sorting out the information that is coming to him in droves.  The first clue came from Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then in bits and pieces from many travelers moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the seas has grown, and somehow the Broken Skull Clan has gained power that should have been out of their grasp. Our informants there say that it can only come from Innoruuk. I am afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with this power. I do not believe that we will be able to uncover all that we need [alone] in time to warn people of the dangers.'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:12 2003] You say, 'Why alone?'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:13 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting Jusean with all that needs to be verified and ensuring that the League's network contacts are all still viable. They will need to stay there in case we must get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the residents of Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it as biased. Thus we are here alone. Does this type of project [interest] you?'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:30 2003] You say, 'I am interested'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:30 2003] Seana Marsinger takes a moment to size you up. 'You appear to be a priest of some sort, am I correct?'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:35 2003] You say, 'yes'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:07:35 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'I believe it is safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe those that call themselves clerics of hate and spite golems. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover a minor signet that shows you have indeed studied the priests, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some vampire dust and a diamond. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for you to do.'<br />
<br />
This results in the first ranged item, apparently called the Gem of Faith (see next part).<br />
<br />
[Fri May 16 21:08:39 2003] You say, 'What further work'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:08:40 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'Wonderful. Return to the plane and continue your studies of the priestly demons. With the new information you have brought I believe we have a good framework of reference for the lower rankings of these beings, however there is another echelon of power that I will need to be familiar with. Seek out the vengeance golems, and the higher priests of hate, the vicars, templars, and high priests. Make sure to keep your protection with you at all times. Some of the priests should have a kind of crest symbolizing their rank; bring me this crest and some vengeance dust from the golems, along with your Gem of Faith.  If you succeed in this task you are more valuable than I could have imagined, and I may need your skill with a final reconnaissance errand.'<br />
<br />
This apparently results in the Gem of Piety, which is used in the final quest.<br />
<br />
[Fri May 16 21:10:52 2003] You say, 'I am ready for the final reconnaissance errand'<br />
[Fri May 16 21:10:52 2003] Seana Marsinger says 'In my personal studies I have heard rumor that there are four archaic tomes that contain some of Innoruuk's darkest secrets. I cannot ask you to uncover all four, I am not even certain that they exist. The fabled writings are the Tome of Dark Healing, Teachings of Innoruuk, Book of the Dead, and Applications of Suffering. If they do indeed exist and you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The tome that I do seek will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's own priests, and they seldom seem to leave their studies. It is possible the Prince of Hate himself holds the tomes close. Find me the Tome of Dark Healing; return it to me with your Gem of Piety and your work is finished.'<br />
<br />
This results in the final Gem.<br />
<br />
I don't have stats on the item, I have not yet been to the new Hate. However, there appear to be 4 possible results from this quest depending on archtype. This one is for priests, there is one for INT casters, one for pure Melee, and the one for Hybrids results in this:<br />
<br />
Gem of Heroism <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP <br />

I would guess the priest one would be FT3 or some such, with stats adjusted for priest classes.<br />
