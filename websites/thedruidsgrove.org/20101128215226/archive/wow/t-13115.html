It would be replacing the Crusader's Locket (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43829).<br />
<br />
Are there any must-have badge rewards this time around, for bear or for kitty? In BC practically the first thing you had to get from badges was the idol, then maybe the cloak. The Ring of Invincibility (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40717) looks tasty but I'll be sad to get rid of my Angelista's Revenge (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34887).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">12-19-2008, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can only recommend the Mirror.<br />
It provides all stats important for a druid on a trinket.<br />
Crit and AP on proc. Cant get any better pre-naxx.<br />
<br />
I would recommend getting the belt cause u wont find anything better pre naxx-25. <br />
the ring is really nice. Also best you can get pre naxx-25.<br />
(only ring which is better is the one from Malygos)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">12-20-2008, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, even after naxx mirror of truth is debatibly top 2 trinkets available right now. For a second, its more debatable, but i like the troll trinket from heroic globbious. <br />
<br />
Mirror of truth: one warning though is that this trinket is only good assuming your crit is high (which it will be if you have any good gear). But if you're just starting to farm heroics, this shouldn't be the first thing you buy with badges. at 40-44 % crit it seems like its almost a constant proc though. can't imagine a better trinket.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-24-2008, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the 2 main choices for belt i've seen are :<br />
<br />
Trollwoven - reasonable mats.<br />
<br />
Sharp-Barbed Leather Belt - from Heroic UK.<br />
<br />
These both seem to be ranked above the Badge one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree with Pakalniete and Kheldar.<br />
<br />
Crit-Rating is an essential DPS-Stat for kitties.<br />
So it out-matches the Sharp-Barbed Leather Belt.<br />
Cause 46 Crit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 16 AP/5 AGI<br />
<br />
And VS the Trollwoven Belt.<br />
46 Crit + Blue-Slot &gt;&gt;&gt; 16 AP/26 AGI in my Opinion.<br />
<br />
A feral lives from his crits to built up his combo-points and keep your rotations up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-29-2008, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i was only quoting a ranking of gear i'd seen on think tank iirc that rated the trollwoven and heroic one above the badge one, although i'm not sure if it was trying to rate them for a particular spec or just generally for a 'feral'.<br />
<br />
however i think its also fair to say that for some people it also a factor in how easy the belt or any item is to get....ie a craftable one is quite easy......farm a few mats / buy a few items and hey presto....<br />
<br />
can take a bit longer to get together 60 badges or so for a good item or be lucky enough for the drop in a heroic....<br />
<br />
if i find that the one in the heroic drops i may well decide its better than the trollwoven one - or has improvements in certain situations and take it to.....same with my trollwoven spaulders....i'll be on the lookout for any item that drops in a heroic that tops them, as i do like items that give me a socket or 2 for the flexibility sockets bring.</div></div><hr />
