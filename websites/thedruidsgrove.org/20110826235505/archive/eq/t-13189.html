 <br />
Since you have 50k, my first assumption you ethier have a high level main or are friends with a high level main -- so I'ld ask them to farm Elysian for you.  If you bought the plat, you can still find a level 60s druid or necro who you could hire to solo elysians for you.  That gear will last you into the 60s.  I was lucky enough to get SoE and the L55 pet spell off of them when I was farming my armor, so that saved me a lot of plat.  <br />
 <br />
Also, if you can find some cheap Acrylia studded or reinforced, I'ld buy that too.  But your need for plat will just raise as your level gets higher and higher so I wouldn't rush to blow it all right away, selling some of that armor back after your done with it will take time as well.</div></div><hr />

The whole set drops randomly off of Disturbed Elysians in umbral plains.  The mobs are level 50's and have ~20k hp.  <br />
 <br />
I wouldn't focus on gaining wis how you stated (if your char isn't a WE or HFL with max wis i'ld consider rerolling though.) Wis will come easy with time, however getting +hp and +mana items will never end - and elysian will give you a nice head start.<br />
 <br />
Beyond Elysians, Umbral plains is a good place to hang around if your looking for gear because occasionally someone will come in and box one of the raid mobs and may hook you up with some loot if your there.</div></div><hr />
