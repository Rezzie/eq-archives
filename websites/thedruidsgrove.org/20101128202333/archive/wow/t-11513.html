<br />
After spending ample time trying out the blood elves, I have switched my focus back to my druid over in Outlands.  Problem is I have so much stuff overloading my bags which were overleaded already because I keep cat, bear, and healing outfits at all times.<br />
<br />
So my question is, &quot;What is the most easily accessed bank if your questing around Thrallmar?&quot;<br />
<br />
I was thinking port to Moonglade &amp; hearth back.  I am just not sure Moonglade has a bank.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Be sure to pick up the FP in Zangar though as you will need to to complete the path back to Hellfire (I couldn't figure that out for the longest time).</div></div><hr />

How long is your druid flight?  The alliance one takes us to darn and it's only 2:30.  That's a quick way to a bank.  I suspect the horde flight is much longer based on the distances between the moonglade and the horde capital cities.<br />
<br />
In any case, Bryne is correct, Shattrah is the bank in the outlands... Once you leave HFP, start harthing to Shattrah.  It's one hop to any of the areas you'll be playing in for the next few levels (Zangermarsh, Tekkar forest, zangrand, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding on to bhroam, Shattrah is a great place to set your hearth to. It's got a bank and access to every major city for your faction.</div></div><hr />
