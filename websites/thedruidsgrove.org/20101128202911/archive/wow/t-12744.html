<br />
New to this forum today, I've just recently started a Night Elf Druid,  having previously been levelling a Shadow Priest I fancied a change.  Husband been trying to talk me into making a Mage but I wanted to be a bear :)<br />
<br />
Question is (I'm sure this has been asked and answered a million times)  Which is the most enjoyable spec?  I've started down the feral path but am considering balance instead.  Not really interested in resto as it seems to be too much like my priest.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be much appreciated<br />
<br />

You may find that Feral is your thing, if you like to sit back and cast you'll enjoy balance, and if you want to keep people alive...well, resto excels at that. <br />
<br />
That said, feral will be your best bet for leveling at least until Outlands at which point you can easily respec to Balance and moonkin it up with all the nice caster gear that is out there as rewards.</div></div><hr />

I am the complete opposite of you at the moment.  <br />
<br />
I've leveled my Resto Druid (progressing SSC at the moment) and have rolled a Shadow Priest (level 54) just so I could finally show up on (and pwn) future raid damage meters.  ;) <br />
<br />
And, TBH, aside from the fact that both can cast heals, I don't find a whole lot of similarities between them.  I don't (and won't) heal with my priest.  I've MH'd for my guild for 2 years now, and I've made it loud and clear that it's time I got to Dps.  ;) <br />
<br />
Feral and Balance are certainly &quot;funner&quot; (and much, much easier) to level, but keep in mind that a Tree of Life will never be refused a raid spot.</div></div><hr />

Oh, well there's that....but you have to understand what it means to a Tree to know they will NEVER hear again:<br />
<br />
&quot;OK everyone.  Nobody die.  We don't have a rezzer.&quot;<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

So, it seems as though there is always a pally, shammy or priest around to do rez'ing if needed.  And if there is a full wipe, well rez'ing doesn't matter all that much unless you have a lazy player that doesn't want to walk back.<br />
<br />
Now if you have 2 folks dieing every other pull (stupid DPS'r), then I can see the need.<br />
<br />
Don't forget you'll now have CC as well!  How about that?  IMO, that's a bigger buff than Revive.</div></div><hr />

Fighting in bear form is such fun, I can't wait till I can be a cat.  Sealion form is a bit odd though LOL</div></div><hr />

Score!!!  <br />

When you posted that I had no idea what you were talking about.  I frantically searched this forum and found the thread on Indoor Entangling Roots.<br />
<br />
Holy Holy Crap.<br />

<br />
Feral is the fastest spec to level with, but as has already been said by other druids here, choose whichever playstyle you like best.  The different talent trees vary enormously in playing style, it's a good idea to try them all eventually.. :&gt;<br />

<br />
i've always and only ever been feral and it was muchos fun to level with.....ability to change from bear to cat to suit the situation, knowing i could still go caster to heal myself was great and felt varied.<br />
<br />
never fancied oomkin or the hunt for good gear - although i understand its a lot better since BC came out.<br />
<br />
dislike the thought of being a healer all the time with limited feral abilities - despite the fact i only ever healed in the good old days of 40 man raids in MC/BWL/AQ40 etc - so never been or ever likely to be resto.<br />
<br />
but yeah - try all 3 to see where you get most fun from but i think its a fact that levelling is easier and quicker if you are feral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">07-28-2008, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another recommendation for trying them all at some point. Despite loving my inner tree I'm hard pushed to recommend going Resto prior to hitting 70 unless you've got a good group/guild of people at a similar level to you so you're never questing solo. You don't so much kill mobs as resto as bore them to death.<br />
<br />
As already said, for out and out levelling speed feral is the path to follow. But you can, and perhaps should, especially once you get to later levels, collect an armour set for all three builds. Transitioning from Feral to Balance when you've already got a few half decent pieces of armour sat in your bank makes life a lot easier even if those pieces are now a few levels out of date.  <br />
<br />
Obviously prioritise your current build when it comes to choosing quest/instance kit rewards but in instance runs where there isn't another druid I rarely run into problems saying &quot;Guys, I know I'm resto, but that's an awesome bit of Feral/Balance gear, would you mind if I rolled on it for my spare kit?&quot;</div></div><hr />
