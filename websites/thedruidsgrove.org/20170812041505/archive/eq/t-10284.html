<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">11-22-2004, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, so most of us have done it at some time or another no matter how minutely or extravogently.  Twinks.  Everybody loves them, everybody hates them.  They're fun!  I got bored over the weekend and decided to brush off the bank and try something new.  I've never played a Shadow Knight before, so I want to make a new one.<br />
<br />
Enter Vampi, my new Inky Shadow Knight on Veeshan.<br />
<br />
So...  Here's what I did to twink her out the wazoo.  I had about 200k to work with, but with some effort and farming I can raise more.  If you can think of ways to improve this, cool!  I'm concentrating, for the most part, on bazaar sold goods and equipment.  Avoiding recommended levels, of course, to create the most impressive level one Shadow Knight Veeshan has ever seen =P  Okay okay, here's what I did, please post any suggestions you might have and I hope other people find this useful in making their own twink tanks!<br />
<br />
Vampi, Dark Elf, Shadow Knight.<br />
Base stat adjustment:  +10 STR, +10 STA.<br />
<br />
Okay...  So I load up my merchant and decide to do a little shopping.  First things first, every tank needs a chestplate.  It's all nice and shiney, so I look for something nice and shiney too for Vampi.  I have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20483&quot;&gt;Acrylic Chestplate&lt;/a&gt; banked, but I pass on that.  Lo-and-behold, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6754&quot;&gt;Matchless Dragonhide Breastplate&lt;/a&gt; is for sale!  Cha-ching.  There's yer shiney.  Next, weapons!  every tank's gotta have weapons.  I have my old &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6093&quot;&gt;The Horn of Hsagra&lt;/a&gt; banked from my ill-fated attempt at a rogue, so that's definitely an option.  However, I grab the &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=5745&quot;&gt;Swiftblade of Zek&lt;/a&gt; thats up because it's cheap and offers more HP (for now) to the fledgling SK.  Heck, if I change my mind, the Horn's in the bank anyway.<br />
<br />
Wrists:  I grabbed the leftovers from my bard - &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8962&quot;&gt;Bracelet of Might&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=8960&quot;&gt;Bracelet of Quickness&lt;/a&gt; because I already have them lying around.<br />
<br />
Some more shopping...  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20460&quot;&gt;Grimling Earbone&lt;/a&gt; is pretty nifty.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7132&quot;&gt;Hardened Gray Flesh Sleeves&lt;/a&gt; too.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7424&quot;&gt;Clattering Bone Necklace&lt;/a&gt; is a nice twink toy, although there's probably better if I dig.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4243&quot;&gt;Velium Fire Wedding Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1643&quot;&gt;Djarn's Amethyst Ring&lt;/a&gt; Make a nice couple.<br />
<br />
I grab &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7112&quot;&gt;Shissar Scale Headband&lt;/a&gt; for the headpiece...  Too bad I can't afford the &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6766&quot;&gt;White Dragon Helm&lt;/a&gt; that's up right now.  That would be great.<br />
<br />
Footwear!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3977&quot;&gt;Lodizal Shell Boots&lt;/a&gt;.  Great for the starting level because you can click it at one, in the tutorial, savign you the log buff log hastle of trying to smuggle temperance into your first few forays.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7131&quot;&gt;Shissar Scaled Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt; too, because the stats and HP aren't too shabby at all.<br />
<br />
Every twink should have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18979&quot;&gt;Cloak of Greater Pernicity&lt;/a&gt;, I say... OR a cloak of flames / flowing water, whatever, if you don't have a haste belt.<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20510&quot;&gt;Acrylia Inlaid Shield&lt;/a&gt; makes a nice shield for the twink, I farmed it in Inner Acrylia myself.  Still have another one in my trader bags.<br />
<br />
Haste?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=953&quot;&gt;Runed Bolster Belt&lt;/a&gt; of course.  It's nice with a whopping 31% haste.  It cost's a pretty penny, of course, but it's worth it!<br />
<br />
Now I would have picked up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6447&quot;&gt;Blade of Carnage&lt;/a&gt; if I were able to afford it at the time, the damage and delay are nice enough and the stats only make it shinier.  Sure, I'll dump it for something else way later on, but for the beginning it's pretty darn useful even without the proc.  Just think when (if) Vampi gets Dual wield...  With the Swiftblade, thats 200hp and a boatload of stats in just those two slots.  If no Dual Wield, oh well, it's still very nice.  BoC &gt; Swiftblade.<br />
<br />
I left a few equipment slots uncalled, because they are either filled with the best I could find or they're flat empty.  If you have ideas for upgrades I'm all ears, Vampi's already around 850 HP unbuffed at level one.  That's pretty darn impressive for a twink, I'd say, but I know it can get better.  Ideas?</div></div><hr />

Nice setup but could use some improvements of course...<br />
<br />
If anyone has suggested improvements, I'm aiming at items without a recommended level and with some impressive HP and physical ability modifiers.  All of it needs to be droppable, so that means no killing Vindi for his BP like I did for my bard :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blackened Acrylia Greatsword for 2hs is just about the best tradeable you can use till level 51 then you can you the War Marshall Bladed Staff.<br />
<br />
Swiftblade of Zek or the Blackened Acrylia Sword till lvl 51 for 1hs...then one of those Midwinters Blades from OoW.  BoC is nice and all but really not the best possible choice unless your always the tank in your group.<br />
<br />
For a lit cash and some time in the Bazaar you can get the Soltice Earring...its nice ear item.<br />
<br />
ps....SK's never get duel wield....hehe</div></div><hr />

All good advice :)  However, sure charged magnetic is nice but my objective with this twink is to make a highly impressive level one character, not a highly impressive mid-late game character :P  the 2hs weapon is nice and I have that banked already for later on, for early on though I'm trying to get everything as high as possible before releasing this menace upon Norrath hehehe.<br />
<br />
Solstice earring is nice, yes, but Recommended level means No Thanks.<br />
<br />
Too bad on dual wield =/  Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6844<br />
<br />
It drops from Grave Master Zo`lun in Chardok. He spawns in Chardok, close to the regal chambers, the weapon is a rare drop and starts proccing at 50. You probably would have to pull the Gravemaster to the zone so your SK can loot it.<br />
<br />
Being Ally in Chardok helps a lot, I equipped an SK, Pally and cleric twink with it. They dmg/del is great. Actually it is a fun run for a level 1 twink from POK to Chardok, I made it 3 times (POK-&gt; OT -&gt; SF -&gt; BW-&gt; CHardok). Remember to bring invis-potions and/or Sowpotions/Jboots. <br />
<br />
Btw, J-boots are one of the nicest twink items, especially for low level twinks. Not having to rely on sow potions or a SOW is a hug plus.</div></div><hr />

I'm letting this one slide because &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6582&quot;&gt;Boots of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, from Tormax, are better AND droppable - therefor bazaar buyable.  tomorrow, we've made plans to kill Avatar of War.  With luck, we will procure a BoC.  Perhaps even a Vindi BP or a Statue BP, but that's stretching the rules :P  Vampi is camped in the arena in a corner, safe and sound :P  Still level one, I might add.<br />
<br />
Vindi:<br />
<br />
68 Paladin Tank, 66 cleric, 56 cleric, 65 monk, 69 enc, 70 Druid (me).  took us about 4 minutes to kill him and both adds.  WHee.....<br />

An Evolved Burrower, Acrylia Caverns.<br />

Does not appear to have a recommended level, nice!  Looks like I'll have to swap pern cloak out for a cloak of flames to adjust.<br />

Yes.  Amendment to the rules:  One-Groupable drop or anything that is not NODROP and can thus be sold in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't going to level the level 1 toon, and just want to get best possible stats... Fungi a terrible buy. However... if you plan on playing him... get a fungi all the way. 15 Regen on a level 1 just rules. They sell for 60-100k on Maelin depending on how lucky you get.</div></div><hr />

Nice, one of my previous guilds did that to a cleric :)  We had more fun hanging out and killing stuff together than we did with the finished product hehe.<br />

So I got a few friends and we killed Vindi lastnight.  Yay for Chestplate of Vindication :)  Also got Vindi Boots last time too.  Not too bad.  Also got Statue lastnight, but the BP went to one of our warriors as an upgrade.  Oh well.  We wiped on the Idol at 55%, but that was because of bad placement (read: adds.)...  Again, oh well.  =)  there's always next time.<br />
<br />
Okay, I need some ideas!  Vampi's magelo is in my sig now, and one of her alternate profiles is &quot;Goal&quot; - thats what I hope to obtain eventually :P  I can't find a better Arms slot item without a recommended or required level.  She's got Hardened Gray Flesh Sleeves right now but I'm sure theres better out there somewhere.  If you can think of anything to replace the Grimling Earbone too, that would be cool, but gotta admit G. Ear is pretty nice.  Maybe there's another ring available?  Better than Djarns?  =P<br />
<br />
All said and done, I think Vampi's looking pretty kickass :P  Just needs a little fine tuning.  I wonder what the record is for the most HP at level one &lt;i&gt;unbuffed&lt;/i&gt;?  hehe.</div></div><hr />

I just did another alternate Magelo profile for Vampi.  Lets pretend that I have 24 friends who are all PoTime geared and never need any drops, and they're bored.  So we go on a killing spree, and Vampi's &quot;Raid Twink&quot; alternate profile is the result.  I was amazed to see it in the end.  Level one SK with almost 2k HP =P...  None of the stuff has recommended level either hehehe.<br />

Would recommend Cloak of Greater Pernicity (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=18979) or Cloak of Flames (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2190) for the back. If you go with Pernicity I say upgrade waist to Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6279)... If you go with Flames, try Belt of the Great Turtle (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3981) (no recommended level I can see).<br />
 <br />
You might want to upgrade your food &amp; drink sources too: Bristlebanes Party Platter (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20377) &amp; Qeynos Afternoon Tea (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15152) (the Tea only due to the fact that an SK is an INT caster when they cast, and you don't need to take a -1 to INT ... though the added STA and STR are nice). The added DEX will compsensate for the 5 you lose on the switch to the Party Platter, and the added AGI will be nice too.<br />
 <br />
I went to Lucy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/advitemsearch.html) and put in DEF, SK and then looked at the item you had. Then went down to the stats that showed up on the item on the search, and looked up anything one (1) over the main stat. Therefore there are likely to be other types of armors with varying other stat upgrades (i.e. More AC or Saves or HP, etc.)<br />
 <br />
ARMS: Netherbian Scale Vambraces (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=8134)<br />

BACK: (See above)<br />

CHEST: /bow<br />

FINGERS: You have about the best I can find for twinkage.<br />
 <br />
HANDS: Velium Encrusted Gauntlets (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25201) (you lose some INT that would be nice to have, but gain more than you lose).<br />

NECK: Zlandicar's Talisman (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27258)<br />
 <br />
SHOULDER: Those are dang nice saves and about the best AC, so the only things I see are HP/Mana/Endurance upgrades - Etched Chain Mantle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62057) or Matchless Dragonwing Mantle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27151)<br />
 <br />
WAIST: (See above)<br />
 <br />
WRISTS: The SCWs are close to the best for stats on droppable, or the &quot;Bracelet of...&quot; Fortitude, etc.<br />
 <br />
WEPS: There are just too many to try and name them all, and weps stats - like armors - will be chosen to bet suit a situation (aggro, resists, etc.) so I will not even try, lol.  Hoarfrost Hammer in UP is nice though, and is the main reason I levelled my PAL: Too nice of a wep to sit on him and do nada.<br />
For an SK, I hear that next to Epic, Scythe of Sundering  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11385)is very souught after, though the recommended level for the efffect is 45 again.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
You may even get better stats than these from recommended level items if they are low enough, but not too likely.<br />
 <br />
BTW: I am doing this because I had thought to look into nice twinkage as well - plus I cannot get EQ to play on my home puter atm, so I need something to do :devil-lau :wiggle:<br />
 <br />
GL on the gatherings and I cannot wait to see what all you end up actually getting!</div></div><hr />

If he has the hammer, make sure not to let him hit you, as he'll proc a DA effect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, not yet.  That's the alternate profile that broke 2khp.  I kept scouring Alla's for drops without a recc. or req. level and the alternate profiles &quot;Goal&quot; and &quot;Raid Twink&quot; are what I came up with.<br />
<br />
Main is what she has now.<br />
<br />
Goal is some of the best I can get by either buying the best in the bazaar or killing one-groupable stuff.  Like vindi BP.  One groupable, so it qualifies.<br />
<br />
Raid Twink is the best she could possibly be equipped without any recommended levels.  If you can find an improvement over something equipped on that profile, please be my guest :P<br />
<br />
It took me a while to find the right combination of gear that would give a level one character over 2k hit points.  There is a lot of it out there ~ the hard part if isolating those which don't have a recommended or required level.</div></div><hr />

Some is from ToV, yes.  And PoFear Cazic.  I am running under the assumption that the level one character can get into these zones with a raidforce protecting her from impending doom :P<br />
<br />
This is because, to my memory, there is no minimum level to get into these zones as long as you either don't get killed or can get the key.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so ToV and Fear are out...  I'll have to spend some time adjusting those slots, I guess.  Darn.<br />
<br />
what about some of the seru stuff each piece has like 100hp or more on it yttrim stuff?<br />
Sanctus Seru is a city zone.  Anyone can go there.  On plenty of occasions I've ran my bard there ( 30ish ) while kiting to clear some aggro.  As for the Lord's chamber room thingy, I dunno, only one way to find out :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Yes, a key is required, but it's a key with an unlimited clicky effect to port your group into the arx.  You can simply port your group in, gate out, port next group in, etc. One key per raid should be enough, but obviously the more keys you have the faster it will go.<br />
<br />
The key quest can be found here.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;There is no level limit to engaging him that I know of.&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
CotH does not work in the Arx.<br />

While this character is a great plate twink, anyone have other twink concepts for other armor classes?  I once made a chanter with full 'loam encrusted' gear once and then some.  Had a truckload of mana right off the bat.  No FT, though, so I could almost go watch a movie while I waited for a full mana regen hehe.</div></div><hr />

You bring your level one twink to loot Lord Inquisitor Seru.  A friend proved this to me, his level one WAR has Yttrium boots and legs, saw them myself when I inspected him =S<br />
<br />
I also found that I could run my druid all the way into Vox's / Naggy's chamber when they aren't up :)  For some reason I had always thought it was an area effect from the ground, like when you step into a PVP arena, etc, that sent you back to the zone.  But nope, it's from the dragons :P<br />
<br />
I will never again underestimate the usefullness of Feign Death =x<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
I now conclude Uber Twink Project version 1.0 =P<br />
I just started having too much fun with Vampi and started leveling her, hehe.  Her final twink gear is the 'level one twink' alternate profile in her magelo.  That was the best she had at level one before I began leveling her.  Now she's 33 and has some better gear, and by the time I hit about 30 on her I threw the 'no recommended level' rule out the door because some things at half benefits were better than some twink toys at full benefits =x<br />
<br />
But Fear not!  Another twink is in the works, even better than before :)  I'll probably never make her, but meet Alex!  A level one Warrior twink.  Following a slightly different set of rules:  Any item conveivably obtainable by a level one without cheating to get into a zone.  level one's can't get into Planes, but they can get into Ssra and Seru raids.  Har har!  No required / recommended level gear, of course.  No limit to difficulty to obtain, as long as the twink can loot it :P<br />
<br />
I have to much free time on my hands.<br />
<br />
Here's SuperTwink v2.0<br />
