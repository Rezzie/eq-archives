 <br />
At lvl 60, I was quadding Swabbies and Pirates in Timorous Deep and I was getting 3 to 4.5 blue ticks per quad.  Now, I am lvl 61 and that XP has dropped to 2 to 2.5 blue ticks per quad.<br />
 <br />
I searched the forums for ideas on better places to XP at 61, and following the suggestions, I found the following:<br />
 <br />
PoN ~ 1.5 blue ticks per quad of Nightstalker werewolves<br />
ME ~ 1 blue tick per quad of Gorangas<br />
PoM ~ 1 blue tick per root/rot on yard trash<br />
PoD ~ 1 to 1.5 blue ticks per Lightcrawler root rotting them.<br />
 <br />
I also measured the AA of the TD Swabbies and Pirates and I am getting 11 - 13 Blue Ticks of AA XP at lvl 61 while quadding.<br />
 <br />
What I would like, is to hear your experiences/suggestions on efficient places to hunt at lvls 61, and I dont look forward grinding out XP in TD.<br />
 <br />
Bear in mind that I have about 4.4K Mana Points and lack any data on Charm Kiting.<br />
 <br />
Thanks,<br />

But I remember doing PoD until 62 or so because I hadn't finished any trials to get PoS/PoV.  Generally charmed the.. pestilent rats I think, and used them to kill other stuff outside the walls, the lightcrawlers kind of beat the crap out of rats and healing charmed mobs generally isn't mana efficient.<br />
<br />
Once I got trial done I did PoV golems and root rotted, unless I could find a partner then we quaded.  Also did PoS frogs, charm kiting and also using frogs to kill bees (very good XP for a while imo) if you use the health regen trick, you can keep the same frog for a long time, although I don't know if your mana pool can handle something like that at the moment, I think I had around 7kmana and was running into trouble sometimes, but with ooc regen and such it could be a lot easier as long as charm stuck long enough to use it.</div></div><hr />

Once you reach level 62, you can enter HoH and try to quad the basements.  But I had a hard time doing that with 5.5k mana iirc.  The PoP mobs and later start to have over 30k HP and quadding them takes some decent gear, mana preservation, mana regen, and perhaps nuke crits would help as well.<br />
<br />
Other options for experience include: Root rotting / charming the Lorok frogs in PoS on the forrest side (need lvl 63 Command of Tunare to charm frogs).  Root Rotting Golems or Razorfiends in Plane of Valor or Murkgliders in Nobles Causeway.<br />

The mobs are level 59+, have about 24k hp (hunted there long time ago, may not be accurate). <br />
 <br />
If you have dire charm, go to CC (the first zone of the DODH expansion) and under water you can charm a snake. Then use it to hunt the creep camp (harmony of nature is recommended to single pull mobs). It's pretty easy exp with a buffed and hasted level 45 pet.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Its very easy to kill all 7 Frogs between repops by charming them, breaking and killing both. If I recall, it was 40% of an AA for 7 frogs. For fun you can try killing the Giants with a hasted pet frog. The frog can beat the Giant easily (may need a heal). The fun starts when Charm breaks and you get summoned between the Giant and your former pet :)<br />
 <br />
Oh, then Quad HoH guards, then Nobles, then the Accursed Nest ...<br />
 <br />
Of course, this is all for soloing, its always more fun to get exp the old fashioned way - killing your group :).<br />
 <br />
Stay away from Fire Tables - may not be so bad now, but they used to be perma camped and there were too many little turf battles there to get any enjoyment out of the game.</div></div><hr />

I spent so much time in TD with those pirates/swabbies I got sick of it. Exp also slowed for me in ME...UP...PON...AND POD.<br />
I did try the valley in Nobles for the Murks.....lousy loot, good exp, but uses all my mana just to  kill one. But 1 kill gives good exp since its lvl 59 mobs.<br />
I heard gargoyles camp in PON is great at lvl 61, but i have not been able to find it, i keep dying trying to find it.<br />
I think i will gring out lvl 61 in TD just so i can then go to HOH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get to the PoN gargs (which are very good XP until you ding 63, at which time it drops off a lot due to the 5 level bonus XP range), you can do this:<br />
<br />
Zone into PoN, and head north high up on the zone wall.  When you hit the corner of the zone, turn and keep going east, until you get near the big rift valley.  Don't get too close or you'll agro the (forgot their names).  Now go south, 50 feet or so west of the cliff dropoff, for a little ways, and then look for a good spot to cross the chasm.  Lev across, and then keep going east, aiming basically for the hedge.  Once at the NE corner of the zone, go south high up on the wall.  You will have to come down off the wall and out a lil bit to get past the tunnel leading to PoNB.  Then keep going south, wrap around the hill that comes up in front of you, and there you are at Garg city :)<br />
