<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">01-25-2007, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Somewhere along the way, after I got Sylvan Infusion and then Chlorotrope, I stopped using Karana's Renewal. As a backup healer, and group healer, our Incomplete Heal was taking too long and not doing enough healing to be of use. The fact that gear focus effects didn't work with KR put the nail in the coffin on using that spell; at the time I had focus effects in gear but no Healing AA's.<br />
<br />
When I started Main Healing again, my Healing AA's and my focus effects allowed me to use the less efficient fast heals with greater effect and I counted on my FT, casting efficiency AA's and other focuses to minimize downtime. Today, with Pure Life and Adrenaline Surge, I find that I am using Chlorotrope as my fast patch and Pure Life as my Tank heal. But I was looking at Karana's Renewal the yesterday and realised that KR does get bonus effects from our healing AA's.<br />
<br />
So my questions to you out there is who is still using Karana's Renewal, what situations are you using it in, and what kind of healing are you getting from it? Clerics are getting exceptional heals on their Complete Heals, do our Healing gifts AA's crit KR? I really want to know if and when I need to brush the dust off of a useful tool in the old tool box.</div></div><hr />

In a group setting, the cast time on KR is just a rez waiting to happen.<br />

This coming from a druid main healer exp grouping 75+ mobs, where mob DPS more often than not is very spikey.  I'll stick with PL/AS and avoid sending anyone into hover mode!</div></div><hr />

Other times it isn't worth using.  Without the ability to crit and the fact that mana saving focuses don't work on it, I'm better off with other heals.  Plus it is slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What kind of healing are you getting from it?<br />
<br />
I understand that we aren't getting crits from it, what kind of heal are we getting with full healing focuses?<br />
<br />
In Complete Heal Rot's are you substituting Druids for clerics two for one, or are you just sticking Druids in the Rotation?<br />
<br />
What kind of mobs are you using Druids in CH Rots for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merdarie</div><div class="date">01-26-2007, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5990 is max KR heals for for me with all AAs.<br />
<br />
In my guild we just put one druid in, we just have a slightly lower pause if its needed.<br />
<br />
And we use druids in CH rots when we dont have enough clerics on.  I was in a CH rot for Council of 9 the other night cause we didnt have enough clerics on for chain and the offtanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5990 Per cast.<br />
 <br />
I understand that we aren't getting crits from it, what kind of heal are we getting with full healing focuses?<br />
<br />
Only Healing Adept effects it, max is 5990 per cast.<br />
<br />
 In Complete Heal Rot's are you substituting Druids for clerics two for one, or are you just sticking Druids in the Rotation?<br />
<br />
In place of a cleric, there is a differance in the healing for the chain, which is dangerous but typically doable if the timing is ok.  You want to alternate Cleric and Druids, not go Cleric Druid Druid Cleric, which increases the chance of tank death during the 4-5 seconds on CH is landing.<br />
 <br />
What kind of mobs are you using Druids in CH Rots for?<br />
<br />
Presently we only use them for Shyra, and only if not enough clerics are on to handle the chain.</div></div><hr />

Just sticking a druid in.  This isn't for any really tough mobs.  But for mobs we farm on a regular basis, druid works fine.  If necessary we just reduce the time between casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">01-27-2007, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hardly ever used KR.  In cheal chains I used to use TR so that my mana would hold out longer, and it was rarely a problem since my TR fired between cleric complete heals.  This was in places like Time, mostly.<br />
<br />
For a while I kept TR loaded in addition to a spot heal, once our spot heals started to cost more than 400 mana.  I used it as a relatively cheap heal when there wasn't time pressure to get a quick heal in.<br />
<br />
Then DoD came out, and I put Reptile in that spell slot and haven't looked back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kagonis</div><div class="date">03-05-2007, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On raids I always have 3 heals memorized: Adrenaline Surge Rk. II (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9942), Sylvan Infusion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883) and Moonshadow (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8498&amp;source=Live) (I haven't had time to play EQ since TBS released) are the healing spells I have memorized.<br />
The reason I still use Sylvan Infusion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883) is that I normally only patch heal on raids and I crit enough to make it really useful. If I have to bring out more healing power I use Pure Life Rk. I (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9875) instead. Note that although I have Pure Life Rk. II (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9876), the HP/Mana ratio is slightly better on Pure Life Rk. I (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9875), and to be honest the extra 111 HP is worth next to nothing IMO.<br />
If you have (and are still wearing) the Everspring Jerkin of the Tangled Briars (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=70893), then Ancient Chlorobon (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6141) will be the most mana efficient patch heal you have.<br />

Adrenaline Surge Rk. III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9943): 3681 HP for 1050 Mana (3.50571 HP/Mana)<br />

Pure Life Rk. III (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=9877):        3399 HP for  794 Mana (4.28086 HP/Mana)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tessowin</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still using KR. We haven't used heal chains since POT. We use ffa chain heals. Timing is up to the healers. Watching the heal channelyou can judge when to cast. ie I see someone cast a Cheal, i count to two and cast mine. If you end up casting at the same time..just duck and recast. Normally we have 2 or 3 clerics and 4 or 5 druids doing all the healing on the Main tank.<br />
 <br />
Advantages to this are you can not cheal if you need to group heal or throw a heal on someone in group or that you see being attacked. You also can react better to the mob rampaging by doing a quick Adrenline surge.<br />
 <br />
KR saves a ton of mana. Doing a lot of fast heals drops your mana quickly and in long fights you will run out. I am saying that with 13k mana and all the healing aa's maxed.<br />

Not for everyone.  The mana efficiency for Karana's Renewal and Ancient Chlorobon is approximately the same for me (13.29 hp/mana compared to 13.25 hp/mana).<br />
<br />
Since mana preservation focus effects don't apply to KR, the better your mana preservation focus, the smaller the difference in mana efficiency will be between KR and a spot heal.</div></div><hr />
