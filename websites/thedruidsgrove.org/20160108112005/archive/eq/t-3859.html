<br />
Now, we only need to confirm is key allows one person to enter, or a group, or a raid party.    It probably does not matter to 99.995% of the server population but it would be nice to wrap up all the information about this quest.  <br />
<br />
This must be as close as we will get!  As you know, all of this information has been copied/pasted from other posts.  The credit goes to all the posters who contributed to get it this far. <br />
<br />
Here are links to the posts that are the source of this document:<br />

<br />
&lt;h3&gt;QUEST AT A GLANCE &lt;/h3&gt;<br />
1. The first part entails gathering 10 different shards from all over luclin.<br />
2. For the second part, you will need to obtain a Scepter Frame and combine the 10 shards to reassemble the Scepter. This Scepter is now a 2 slot container. <br />
3. The third part will require the killing of the Emperor and looting a Staff. This Staff has 2 charges of Summon a Shaded Sphere. Zaar of Triton confirmed it with : Yea 2x charges of 20 power source, so 40. <br />
4. The fourth part is the re-energizing of the Scepter by combining the Orb of Luclinite and the summoned Shaded Sphere in the reassembled Scepter.<br />
5. Enjoy your key as the final product is the Scepter of Shadows aka Vex Thal Key - Item 22198 in Magelo.<br />
6. Use key to enter Vex Thal  ======&gt; spell effect is not relevant.<br />
<br />
&lt;H3&gt;LIST AND LOCATIONS OF ITEMS NEEDED&lt;/H3&gt; <br />
Shards<br />
<br />
Please note that the Maiden Eye shard seems to be the most elusive to obtain.  It drops from a few different Gorangas but seems to require heavy camping.  Sorry! <br />
<br />
Shard 1: The Grey - Kel - 22185 - Boulder, Sun Revenants<br />
Shard 2: FG - Dat - 22186 - Shik'Nar Warrior, Soldiers and possibly Foragers<br />
Shard 3: Scarlet Desert - Set - 22187 - Sun Revenants and Sun Reavers.<br />
Shard 4: The Deep - Raf - 22188 - Thought Leeches or Thought Horrors<br />
Shard 5:Ssra - Vin - 22189 - Skeletal Drudge and a few more random mobs <br />
Shard 6:Akheva - Dax - 22190 - Xi Vius or Shadow Reavers - Roudy Rubble - Shade Golem<br />
Shard 7      : Dawnshroud - Lor - 22191 - Rockhoppers - Sambala<br />
Shard 8: Maiden Eye - Tak - 22192 - Goranga Forager, Gatherer, Hunter, Prophet <br />
Shard 9:Acrylia - Ved - 22193 - Grimling Skullcrackers<br />
Shard 10:Sanctus Seru - Kelara - 22194 - A Legionneer of the Hand at Marus Seru zone<br />
<br />
Other Items and Containers <br />
Summoned from Emperor Staff: Shaded Sphere - 22195<br />
Glowing Orb of Luclinite - 22196<br />
Sceptre of Akelha Ra FRAME - 17323.<br />
<br />
The first container you will need is the Sceptre of Akelha Ra FRAME. It is a 10 slot container than holds only tiny items. It is originally called the Shadowed Scepter Frame.  The reassembled Scepter is a 2 slot container that will be used to combine the Sphere and Orb. <br />
<br />
Vex Thal Key <br />
The Scepter of Shadows - Item 22198<br />
<br />
&lt;h3&gt;A FEW DETAILS, QUOTES AND DIALOGUES&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
This has been copied from several posts and consolidated. Again, credit goes to original posters.<br />
<br />
GETTING THE SCEPTER IN AKHEVA...<br />
<br />
Getting ready for the dialogues...<br />
&lt;QUOTE&gt;Head to Akheva. From the zone in, run straight, past the fallen pillar. When you get to the next room, head right. Going left will take you to Va'Dyn. Go down the next set of stairs. To your right is IV. Go left, you will see a large &quot;gate&quot; with two &quot;shades&quot; standing on the left and right edges of this gate.<br />
<br />
Pull the far right shade, it will bring 2 mobs. Clear them, then move in hugging the right side. Cross directly over the open area and kill the alien midget mob that is by a set of stairs. Then run up those stairs where you will fight 3 alien mobs that have 4 arms each. They only hit for ~160s and can be slowed. Be sure to root the last one. Sometimes they will drop a &quot;Ans Xundrau xi Tekar&quot; 13/25 3 to all stats dagger, melee and caster only.<br />
<br />
At this point, you can drop down from the stairs and you will see a number of green con &quot;Sacrificed Remains&quot; and a &quot;Shimmering Presence.&quot; <br />
<br />
From there you will need items from a mage and a necro to continue the script. <br />
<br />
Dialogues and actions...<br />
A shimmering presence's voice invades your mind. <br />
'Shadows can not exist without light. Bring me a wisp stone so that my balance can be righted by their soft glow. <br />
<br />
This points to a MAGICIAN SPELL: <br />
Name: Summon Wisp <br />
Level: 4 <br />
Type: Summon a No-Rent Miscellaneous Object <br />
Actual Effects: Summons Wisp <br />
Description: This will summon a &quot;wisp stone&quot; that acts as a light source when worn for those who cannot see well at nighttime.<br />
<br />
Give the summoned Wisp stone and Spirit of Akelha `Ra will spawn. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, The Spirit of Akelha`Ra'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra 's hollow eyes look up at you. You have the distinct impression that she can see right into the darkest shadows of your soul. She opens her mouth to speak but the sounds you hear come from inside your mind. 'Greetings mortal, thank you for releasing me from my [tormented prison]. <br />
You say, 'what tormented prison'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra appears to be fading in and out of existence as you speak to her. The spirit's voice fills your mind. 'I am Akelha`Ra, once high priestess of Luclin and leader of the Akheva. This form you see before you now is a fading remnant of my former existence. The storm was the cause of my imprisonment in the world of undying [spirits]. <br />
<br />
You say, 'what spirit'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'We Akheva are immortal entities placed in this plane by the mistrees of shadow. We are her most perfect creation. Death has no meaning to us, as even in death we find rebirth through the power of the mistress. My imprisonment was caused by my seperation from the power of the mistress by [Atenha`Ra]. It was she who sent the storm to destroy me and all that followed me. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'who is atenha ra'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'It is more then a little ironic that Atenha`Ra is a reflection of myself. An entity created from my own consciousness, a reflection of a shadow. She now holds the seat of grand power in [Vex Thal], and I have not the power to gain entry to the city, let alone face her. You must find my scepter that was lost in the storm to gain entry to Vex Thal. The scepter has likely lost much of it's power from being shattered. Once it is reassembled you will need to merge a Orb of Luclinite with a source of celestial power inside the scepter. The spirits whisper that the emperor of the Shissar holds the power to manipulate such energy. Be weary of him, he is heralded as the slayer of gods, the defiler of realities. '<br />
<br />
You say, 'what Vex Thal'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says 'Vex Thal is the sacred home of the Akheva. The place where Luclin's power directly touches this world...ungh... I can not summon the frame of my scepter in my current weakened state. I need a soul to regain my pow...' As she speaks you can see her slowly fade out of existence. You wonder how long her spirit will stay with this world. She seems entirely unable to speak to you now, and can only muster the strength to point at the ground at Dimi 's feet. Dimi reaches down a picks up a small emerald off the ground, but it disappears silently into the shadows. Akelha`ra looks as if she is trying to speak again. '<br />
<br />
This points to a Emerald Essence.  Hand it in to collect the Scepter Frame that will allow to reassemble the Scepter.<br />
<br />
You say, 'what frame of your scepter'<br />
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra opens her mouth to speak, but the voice in your head is no longer audible. You reach forward to touch the fading shadow of a creature and draw back in horror as your hand disrupts the spirit before you. She evaporates into the shadows once more.<br />
<br />
Poof :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaded Stones in Akheva also drop a shard<br />
<br />
for seru its any Named &quot;Legonnaire&quot; not the ones around the zone<br />
<br />
Glowing orb of Lucinlite drops off many lower level and upper level uber mobs<br />
<br />
THO<br />
Greig<br />
the Rhags<br />
and others, seems any almost any named zone boss can drop the orb.<br />
<br />
Since Killing the Emporer requires a sub quest for the Key to the Emporer in Ssra, you probably ought to make a spot for that subquest too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiggin</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Subquest as in ShissarBane weapons gathering?<br />
<br />
I thought this had been posted before.  Oh well :)<br />
<br />
To have a chance to kill the Emperor, you need a lot of people equipped with weapons that have a Sisshar Bane effect.<br />
<br />
1) You need one of the weapons wielded by the elite Shissars or similar weapons. They are the easy part, and no need to really camp these<br />
<br />
2) You need Green metal from the mines in Ssra. They drop off named skeletons, and need 2 pretty solid groups to keep the caverns cleared (one group is enough, just won't keep all the PHs cleared as fast). <br />
<br />
3) Combine the weapon and the Green metal in the forge outside the mines. You don't need any blacksmithing skill, 0 works just fine. You get a corrupted shissar weapon of the type you combined. <br />
<br />
Here a few examples - the Bane Effect is usually 6 DMG.<br />

one idol<br />
one ring<br />
one pouch<br />
one insignia<br />

<br />
You need 4 items for all 4 &quot;basic&quot; levels of the temple:<br />
<br />
1) Go to the basement level of the Shissar temple.<br />
<br />
2) Kill any of the named Taskmasters that can be used to trigger the Glyphed/Exiled/Cursed fights. The Taskmasters frequently drop the pouch necessary to combine the items.<br />
<br />
3) Once you have acquired the pouch. Head to the first floor and camp the random rare spawn Commander Zazuzh. He drops the idol you need.<br />
<br />
4) Once you've acquired the idol, go to the second floor and in similiar fashion camp the random rare spawn Commander Zeruzsh. He drops the ring you need.<br />
<br />
5) Then head to the Imperial Guard chamber where you can access the locked teleport to the Emperor's chamber. By killing the Imperial Guards you can spawn 3 named rares all of which drop the last piece you need, the insignia. These are General Kizuhx, Arbiter Korazhk, and Advisor Zekuzh.<br />
<br />
6) Put all 3 items into the pouch and combine. You will receive a Ring of the Shissar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya know... if they were thinking two steps ahead they woulda made the components drop from some of the mobs needed for the twilight armour quests. By doing it that way, there is a good chance the PHs would get quicker and the actual quest mobs would appear with greater frequency.</div></div><hr />

If your guild can't kill emperor soonish, there's no point in doing this quest, other than maybe frustrating the people who can kill the emperor by making their Vex Thal key quests take much longer as they wait in line to kill the mobs that drop shards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  no key needed to enter Ssra<br />

2.  ring needed as key to enter Emperor's area <br />
<br />
3.  then key to Vex Thal attained through killing appropriate mobs in Emperor's area<br />

1. Correct<br />
2. Correct<br />
3. Correct but not only do you kill the Emperor, you must go around collecting the shards, orbs, etc etc...which are in different zones and drop of green to red cons (to a lvl 60).</div></div><hr />

The goranga seer, at least on BB, might be a rare drop.  I killed 6 seers one day last week and no shard.<br />

<br />
I remember reading up some on this a million years ago, but now can't remember for sure.<br />
<br />
I THINK I read that the key (a staff) was an AoE port that took you into VT (everyone in the vicinity of the key holder or something).  I also think I read that there were a fixed number of charges, after which you needed to recharge the staff by killing the emperor again and getting the luclinite.<br />
<br />
That something my fevered brain made up?  IF so how does it really work?<br />
<br />
No, we are not about to kill emperor, but I am curious and know a bunch of you are VT'ers.<br />

<br />
I THINK I read that the key (a staff) was an AoE port that took you into VT (everyone in the vicinity of the key holder or something). I also think I read that there were a fixed number of charges, after which you needed to recharge the staff by killing the emperor again and getting the luclinite.<br />
<br />
That something my fevered brain made up? IF so how does it really work?&quot;<br />
<br />
The VT key is just a normal single person click key and it lets you in, like a sebilis key.<br />
<br />
And the emp used to drop a staff with 2 charges of a spell that summoned 20 rifts, so you got 40 rifts, which were dropable, hence the problem(Player Auctionable).<br />
<br />
Now 5 mobs spawn after emp dies and they drop 8 no drop rifts each I think...I forget the ratio of mob to rifts, but you get 40 rifts per kill all the same.</div></div><hr />

It can be really hard to get a group together to farm shards, and even then when one drops you have a 1 in 6 chance usually heh, so I suggest doing it solo =)</div></div><hr />

If you are ever going to be able to finish the key, you are going to have to be in a guild that can kill &lt;insert_any_luclin_boss_mob&gt; for the Orb of Luclinite and then kill the Emperor for the power source.<br />
<br />
  Even if you could get an orb and power source somehow, what are you going to do in VT without a guild capable of raiding there?<br />
<br />
  And it you _are_ in such a guild and your guildmates won't help each other get shards for VT keys then your guild probably isn't ever going to make it into VT in enough force to do anything there anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get most of the shards and some bits of the emp key and you'll be better off if thats the way you intend to go.<br />

<br />
I was just stating that is it possible as to help others that might think they *must* have a group to camp the shards. I recommended it because your guaranteed the shard.<br />
I dunno why your getting so defensive and almost hostile though =P</div></div><hr />

Personally, I wouldn't recommend it...  especially since the shard-dropping bugs in FG are good experience for a full group since the exp changes.</div></div><hr />

You get a power group down there you can kill the entire royal family repeatedly and get a fairly nice collection of armor.<br />
<br />
Chitin Legs, Arms and belts drop VERY frequently.<br />
<br />
I'm KOS to blue bugs now though =p  And I like it!</div></div><hr />
