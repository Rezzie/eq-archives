 <br />
 This quest consists of 3 arcs which can be done in any order:<br />
 <br />
 1 in Plane of Magic – Spirit of Ao the Fourthborn (Arcstone)<br />
 1 in Plane of Rage - Oathimir the Outcast (The Devastation)<br />
 1 in Eldarr - Tak'Valnakor (North Ro)<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
     From the beginning:<br />
 Head to North Freeport. Ascend the arcane tower to it's pinnacle. At the very top you will See An Emissary of Druzzil and a portal.<br />
You say, 'Hail, Emissary of Druzzil'<br />
Emissary of Druzzil syas, 'Greetings &lt;name&gt;. I was sent by my mistress to search out those Norrathians that would have the power to assist her. You look as though you may be able to with stand some of the forces of my home. Perhaps you would be interested in accepting her [proposition]?'<br />
[COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What proposition?'[/COLOR]<br />
Emissary of Druzzil says, 'Druzzil Ro is seeking the most powerful of this realm to assist her in a rather troubling disturbance. If you are [interested] though, you will need to speak with her yourself. I am unable to say more on the subject.'<br />
[COLOR=Purple]You say, 'I am interested.'[/COLOR]<br />
Emissary of Druzzil says, 'Take this crystal with you to speak with Druzzil. It will show you have spoken with me and she will tell you more of this disturbance. I must warn you though, only those that have proven capable of enduring the work of Druzzil will be allowed to speak with her. Once you enter the Plane of Magic, seek out Apprentice Mage Sarcrynn. He will be able to direct you further.'<br />
Receive:  Shard of Mana  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84164)<br />
   Now step on the portal and prepare for your visit to the plane of magic.<br />
   Once in Arcstone, proceed to Arch Mage Galsin<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Hail, Arch Mage Galsin'[/COLOR]<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'Ah another visitor to this place. It's always good to see a fresh face, particularly if that person has news of use to me. Tell me , have you heard of the [Plane of Music]?<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say. 'What plane of music?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'When I arrived in this place I discovered an ancient book wheich contained an amazing amount of knowledge lost to Norrath over the ages. One of the more interesting sections spoke of the Plane of Music. The wonders described within that plane are almost beyond belief. I must see them for myself. The problem I'm confronted with is how exactly to enter the plane. The book has a small amount of [information] in that regard, but its not the most heartining news.<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What information?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'According to the book entry to the plane could only be accomplished by sounding a certian pure tone. This tone is normally impossible for mere mortals to generate, but there were chimes created that, when struck, would sound this tone and transport the bearer to the plane. Unfortunately the book also mentions that all of the known chimes were destroyed by Sullon Zek in a fit of rage. Apparently she took offense to a light hearted song of some sort written by Ayonae Ro. After reading that I began focusing my search on in a new [direction].<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What direction?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'I have spoken with others on this subject prior to your arrival. Many of them agreed to pass on any news or rumors that heard to me. Recently one of these people told me of a scrykin named Ao the Fouth Born. From what I've been told he is seeking a book written by Druzzil Ro herself. It is my hope that this book has information that might provide an alternate route into the plane. If you wish to help in my research seek out Ao and see what you can discover.'<br />
   Find Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born near the portal to relic Northwest of the Skylance<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Hail, Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born'[/COLOR]<br />
   Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born says 'Greetings, traveler. I am Ao, the Fourth Born of the [scrykin lineage].'<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What scrykin lineage?'[/COLOR]<br />
Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born says 'We scrykin mark the attempts of Druzzil Ro to create organic life from magic. We are living creatures, just like you, but we are each born with a terrible [flaw]. '<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What flaw?'[/COLOR]<br />
Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born says 'We absorb ambient energy from the Plane of Magic. This makes us more powerful as we age, but also more hideous, more unpredictable, even more dangerous. All but the youngest of scrykin have become twisted monsters, creatures consumed by paranoia and delusion. I alone avoided this degeneration by abandoning my physical body and becoming a spirit. This was not an easy process, but it was the only way I could fulfill my promise to Druzzil. She has commanded me to help you and your [group] find the lost chime of Ayonae, the goddess of music.'<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Help my group.'[/COLOR]<br />
Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born says 'Good luck, . Once you find your way into Skylance Tower, speak with my student, Arkahn. He is waiting for you there.'<br />
 <br />
 (Complete the 3 mission Skylance arc from Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born and get chime)<br />
 <br />
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Arc 1 consists of 3 missions.<br />
 <br />
 Mission 1: &quot;The Library&quot;<br />
   Quest locks immediately.<br />
   Enter Skylance<br />
<br />
<br />
       [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Hail, Arkahn'[/COLOR]<br />
Arkahn says 'Greetings, . I am Arkahn the Gatekeeper of Skylance. Ao has instructed me to wait here for your arrival. I cannot help you overtly, but I will serve as your guide while you remain in this tower. Tell me, where are you headed? The [oubliette]? The [library]? The [laboratory]? Or perhaps [Daosheen's Study]? I can direct you to all these chambers. '<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Where is the Library?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arkahn says 'The library lies beyond the first portal up the ramp. Follow my familiar to the gate. Tread lightly for many of the elder scrykin have locked themselves in the chamber to pour over the ancient tomes.'<br />
   <br />
 Run through the portal, hop down to the bottom, and talk to Student Joban.<br />
 <br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say. 'both halves'[/COLOR]<br />
Student Joban says 'Aye, split in twain the symbol was. Each half bestowed upon one of the assistants. You must defeat both if you are ever to gaze upon the pages of the Codex and gleen its secrets.' <br />
 <br />
 Evac and prepare to really start the mission.<br />
 <br />
 Clear to the right platform and kill named. Every 10% one of the books comes alive. Loot the symbol.<br />
 <br />
Clear to the left platerform from port in. kill named. adds spawn around the libary called Scrykin Bookworm every several seconds. These are white / yellow to 70 hit 1400 and have the 2 AEs of all other Scrykin Models.<br />
 <br />
The longer the Assisant is aggro the more adds spawn, the ones which spawn near you will aggro/add but the ones that spawn on the far side of the room will just wander back and forth.<br />
 <br />
 loot symbol.<br />
 <br />
 Clear to the back platform and turn the 2 symbols in to get the tome.<br />
 <br />
 Turn the tome in to Ao the fourth and a chest will pop and you will recieve a character flag.<br />
 <br />
 ------------------------------------------------<br />
 Mission 2 &quot;the oubliette&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
       [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Hail, Arkahn'[/COLOR]<br />
Arkahn says 'Greetings, . I am Arkahn the Gatekeeper of Skylance. Ao has instructed me to wait here for your arrival. I cannot help you overtly, but I will serve as your guide while you remain in this tower. Tell me, where are you headed? The [oubliette]? The [library]? The [laboratory]? Or perhaps [Daosheen's Study]? I can direct you to all these chambers. '<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Where is the oubliette?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arkahn says 'The oubliette lies beyond the portal on this floor. Follow my familiar to the gate and be careful. The oubliette contains many forgotten magical creations, most of which are dangerous, unstable or, quite simply, not meant to see the light of day.'<br />
 <br />
 Run around, kill mobs break eggs.<br />
 <br />
 Really it is that trivial.<br />
 <br />
the stonemites have almost no life. our tank pulled out a 2hs and disc'd them on each pull killing almost all of them instantly.<br />
 <br />
Kill one egg at a time as failures pop a mob. Eventually whoever is killing the eggs will break the right one and get an item given to them (inventory or mouse I don't remember)<br />
 <br />
 turn in egg to Ao the 4th receive character flag and a chest<br />
 -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 Mission 3 &quot;The laboratory&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
    [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Hail, Arkahn'[/COLOR]<br />
Arkahn says 'Greetings, . I am Arkahn the Gatekeeper of Skylance. Ao has instructed me to wait here for your arrival. I cannot help you overtly, but I will serve as your guide while you remain in this tower. Tell me, where are you headed? The [oubliette]? The [library]? The [laboratory]? Or perhaps [Daosheen's Study]? I can direct you to all these chambers. '<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Where is the laboratory?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arkahn says 'The laboratory lies beyond the second portal up the ramp. Follow my familiar to the gate. Mind the equipment. Many scrykin artificers have created guardians to protect their workspace.'<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Bring a rogue or a monk I don't know if they see sos, but you'll want something.<br />
 <br />
 the person who gets this quest is given an egg!<br />
 go to Skylance, head into the lab. go to the center table and place the egg on cursor and hit &quot;U&quot; (same as 7th hammer key)<br />
 This will pop an egg onto the table. Now you have 3 mobs pop and you get an emote in red text.<br />
 <br />
Every time you successfully answer the emotes' directions, another lab attendant will spawn. These mobs are kos and wander the upper area where the equipment controls are.<br />
 <br />
 Every time you fail, a zombie mob pops out of the egg and attacks. Also if you fail, you have to start from the begining. <br />
 <br />
There are 8 emotes and all 8 need to be done correctly and in order.... IE the emotes are given randomly, but all 8 will be given to you and you must complete all 8 with no failures.<br />
 <br />
once the 8th emote is handled, a named will pop. redcon to 70, about 1.5-2k hitter.. like all the others that look like him was weak to nukes/dots. beat him down and win!<br />
 <br />
 The eMotes shown and the spot to be clicked are the following: <br />
 <br />
 - The gaze-O-rama should be used to confer the egg with greater sight = <br />
 click: WEST console <br />
 <br />
 - Use the trans-injector to infuse the essence of magic into the egg = <br />
 click: NORTH console <br />
 <br />
 - A good dose of ethereal goo needs to be applied next = <br />
 click: EAST console <br />
 <br />
 - Switch on the hyper-manipulator to align the proteins into their proper sequence = <br />
 click: SOUTH console <br />
 <br />
 - From the ether, call out the spirits willing to aid you in this experiment = <br />
 click: EAST equipment <br />
 <br />
 - The dispenser has the next critical component = <br />
 click: SOUTH equipment <br />
 <br />
 - Distill the magical spirits into their purest form = <br />
 click: WEST equipment <br />
 <br />
 - Remove the necrotic portion of the tissue = <br />
 click: NORTH equipment<br />
 <br />
 The way we (my guild and groups) handled this was:<br />
 North(N), South(S), East(E), West(W)<br />
 Inner(I), Outer(O)<br />
 Much easier than explaining what the clickies looked like<br />
 <br />
 So:<br />
 NI = Use the trans-injector to infuse the essence of magic into the egg<br />
 NO = Remove the necrotic portion of the tissue<br />
 EI = A good dose of ethereal goo needs to be applied next<br />
 EO = From the ether, call out the spirits willing to aid you in this experiment<br />
 SI = Switch on the hyper-manipulator to align the proteins into their proper sequence<br />
 SO = The dispenser has the next critical component<br />
 WI = The gaze-O-rama should be used to confer the egg with greater sight<br />
 WO = Distill the magical spirits into their purest form<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 *****NOW*****<br />
 <br />
 The mission is over but WAIT!<br />
 You want to do the optional portion!<br />
 Go back to Spirit of Ao the Fourth Born . give him the tarnished chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=36144) that is in your inventory now. He will give you back a harmonic chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84159).  <br />
<br />
<br />
       Proceed to Arch Mage Galsin<br />
 <br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'Hail, Arch Mage Galsin'[/COLOR]<br />
 Arch Mage Galsin says ' Is that. . . ? You found a Chime?!? Let me see it!'<br />
 <br />
 Hand in the Harmonic Chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84159) and he will return both the Harmonic Chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84159) &amp; and new Silent Harmonic Chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84160)<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'Unbelievable, I was sure none of the chimes had survived Sullon's wrath. This is a fascinating artifact, I've never seen anything like it.' Galsin taps the chime with a small hammer and stares in amazement when no sound is created. 'But the chime. . . This must be the one. It can only mean there is some thruth to the [whispers] I have been hearing.'<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What whispers?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'There have been rumors amongst the residents of this plane of a terrible disaster in the Plane of Music. Some unknown force has closed the plane off from all outside influences and by all implications begun to corrupt it's very nature. The failure of this chime must mean that this corruption has reach a point where the purity of this note will no longer transport you. If this is true then there must be a way of modifying the chime to account for the corruption. The idea of modifying the chime does have [complications] associated with it though.<br />
 [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'What complications?'[/COLOR]<br />
Arch Mage Galsin says, 'The material of this chime is, as far as I can tell, of divine origins. There are few forces hat would be able to modify or harm it in any way. There is a possibility though. . . yes. . . the opening of the Plane of Rage must have been a message. Sullon Zek was able to destroy the chimes, so her magic must be able to affect this material. If you were able to find someone on her plane to help they may be able to modify the chime as needed. Go there and inquire about the chime with any that would speak with you. Perhaps the chime will prove to be our key to the Plane of Music after all.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 Proceed to Devistation:<br />
 Link: Silent Harmonic Chime (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84160) to Oathmir the Outcast or Say anything about the chime to him.<br />
Oathmir the Outcast says, 'Our people know some earth magic, and I might be able to work on this chime for you, but I must ask for your help first. I am lost, but I feel that I have a purpose here. It is difficult to explain to someone that has never been part of the cycle what it is like to be taken from it. I have lost all rage and have been left with emptiness. I no longer feel the desire to be with Her in the tower. I felt the rage leaving me slowly from the moment I was chosen as Vessel. She touched me then, instilling me with her rage, but it did not feel right to me. It was somehow tainted, impure. I could not accept it and the moment I rejected her rage all of my rage started to flow away from me. Something is very wrong with our godess. Her rage is no longer pure, though it may be my own heart that is corrupt. Perhaps you can find out what has happened. Perhaps you can get into the tower and find out what has gone wrong.<br />

<br />
       [COLOR=Red]Maelin's Dialogue:[/COLOR]<br />
<br />
<br />
       [COLOR=Red]Bolvirik Skin:[/COLOR]<br />
 Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I've never seen anything like it before. The being that you took this skin from obviously belongs to a culture that uses scarring and tattooing to represent rank of some sort. Most likely a scar or tattoo is earned in battle or when coming of age. The more scars the more power the creature would have in their society. But there is another layer of meaning here. There is a section here that appears to be written in a form of the giant language, then disguised with a laughably simple code. It appears to be a fragment of some sort of legend. . . Here, let me write it down for you.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Undead Skin:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Well, this is strange. This flesh has obviously been preserved using necromancy. But the inking that has been done to it is relatively fresh, done after the preservation and after dead. This is hard for me to translate normally, but I have some special tricks for understanding magical writing. I'll write this down for you, but the general idea here is that it talks of a ritual of passage, something about becoming full. I guess I never really understood the undead, perhaps you can make sense of it.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Kobold Fur:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'What beautiful patterns! They look like decorations, at least at first glance. But I have a keen eye for art and an even keener one for patterns. There's a language in there, something like Kobold. It's sort of a pictorial description of, well, of a story about a powerful Kobold who became a god. It also talks about another god, a female. Here's a transcription, as best as I can make it. It's by no means complete, but with more information it might mean something.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Orc Skin:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I've always known that orcs liked to paint themselves at times of war, but I've never seen this. These markings are permanent and appear to be very, very old. I'm very familiar with orcish languages, but I've never seen this one. It appears to be a combination of several modern and ancient versions of orcish. The combination makes it very hard to read, but it seems as though it is a history of something called a vessel. I've written it down for you, but you'll need more information to make sense out of it.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Evil Eye Skin:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Well, this is very odd indeed. You say that this is the skin from an Evil Eye? I have never heard of those creatures cutting designs into themselves or each other, but that's exactly what this appears to be. Even more surprising is the fact that this appears to be more than just a result of combat, it seems to be a code of some sort. The eyes are rather bright, and this makes it easier for me to understand what this code means, there's a logic behind it. It seems to be a path or method to achieve power in a place it calls Rage. There are a lot of details missing, of course, but here is my translation of the information encoded onto this bit of skin.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Wurine Fur:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'This is a fantastic pelt. It's scarred and bloody, sure, but look at it! Under the blood and fur there is a pattern scratched into the skin. It's not just an animal scratching at fleas, it's an actual language of sort. Very primitive and so very hard for me to understand, but I can make some sense of it. The text is by no means complete, but I see references to rage and anger and the perfecting of those emotions. Something about power and completeness being linked to such perfection. I guess it makes sense that a creature with such emotions would seek to the perfect form. Here, I've made some notes about what's written here. With enough information perhaps it will make some sense.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Drachnid Carapace:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Well, isn't this unpleasant! Spiders give me the creeps, you know. Huge sentient spiders. . . well it makes me dizzy to think of it! But I am a scholar and I must overcome this and examine this thing you brought me. Yes, there are definitely markings on this. It seems to be a version of Dark Speech and therefore easy enough to understand, but there is some form of code involved. I can only assume that this is to prevent it from being read easily. Why would someone do this? From what I can read of this, it seems to be the only way that this creature could retain memory of important information. It refers to itself as a Lore Warrior and implies that there are others, not all of the same species. Very interesting. Here, this is a copy of what I can read on this, um, skin. Perhaps with enough information a more complete picture will be visible.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Shiliskin Skin:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Well, this is not at all slimy as I would have expected! It's still a bit disgusting, though. I wonder what sort ink they used for these markings. It appears to be very long-lasting, and yet these markings have been retouched several times. I would think that markings this deep in the skin would last far longer than one lifetime. The language is incomprehensible to me, but I can understand the pictures easily enough. It seems to imply that this culture believes in a power beyond theirs and that there is a longing within them to serve that power. There is also an underlying tone that seems to suggest that they would destroy and replace that power once allowed into its service. Here, take these notes and this skin. It's a bit too creepy for me.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Berzerker Skin:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Hmm, I'm not sure that I want to be known for my interpretation of skin art as language, but I'll see if I can make sense of it. The pigment seems familiar, like something the Northmen use. And the patterns seem similar as well. From what I understand of the iconography of that culture, this seems to be a story about Sullon Zek. Well, a very small part of the story, anyway. Most of it is missing. I wonder if the rest of the body had the story, or if it was carried in many pieces by separate people who would come together to be one book, so to speak. Here is what I can understand of the tale. Perhaps you can find enough pages to get an understanding of the whole story.'<br />
[COLOR=Red]    Final skin turned in:[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'I see that you have a large number of translations from those saga skins. If you can bind them together into a book using a book binding and bring it back to me, I might be able to show you how to perform the rite that is described. I'm not really sure why any sane person would choose to do so, but perhaps you do.'<br />
   [COLOR=Red]Books turned in, Spell received, and starting of[/COLOR] “Becomming the Vessel”:<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Well, these are very interesting! I've learned a lot from the things you have brought me, so I wanted you to have this.'<br />
 <br />

 <br />
 Go to Maelin.<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say. 'What enraged flesh charm?'[/COLOR]<br />
Grand Librarian Maelin says 'Ah, yes. Here is the charm that I promised you. I think I might be able to make the charm stronger. Because it gains its strength from rage and from the Plane of Rage, it might be possible to make it stronger by killing the greatest beings, the ones most attuned to the plane, and using their essence to strengthen the charm. I suppose we'll need body parts. Now I'm not a proponent of murder and gore, but if you bring me likely body parts I might be able to use the essence of the dead being to enhance the charm. While I work with the body part, you will have to hold the charm, to keep it attuned to you. Good luck!'<br />
 <br />
 Receive: Enraged Flesh Charm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=88099)<br />
 <br />
 ---------------------<br />
 Mission 3: Samples of Corruption (6-54 people)<br />
 <br />
(Currently the only part NEEDED for ToB key, but someone must be flagged fully somehow to achieve this. What I mean is, you only need Skylance 1-3 and Samples of Corruption to be complete up to the Twisted Chime, but somone needed to do Saga skins and Becomming the Vessel to have reverse &quot;flagged&quot; people. The Key element to getting this quest is to have completed &quot;Becomming the vessel, this gets you the enraged flesh charm from Maelin and allows you to get the Samples of Corruption instance.)<br />

 Go to Oathmir the Outcast<br />
   [COLOR=Purple]You say, 'I can find out'[/COLOR]<br />
   Recieve option for Sapmles of Corruption normal or hard and a 10 slot container<br />
 Oathmir the Outcast says 'Take this chest to store any clues you may find. Return to me should you [need another].'<br />

 Enter Sverag<br />
 <br />
 Step 1: Enter Razorthorn (Quest locks)<br />

 Turn in Silent Harmonic Chime to Oathimir the Outcast:<br />
Oathmir the Outcast takes the tiny chime in his huge hands. He spins it slightly as it dangles from his thick fingers, staring at it intently. 'Yes, I think I understand. This is tuned to a place, but that place is not as it was expected, much like my experience with Her. I think I can change this, make it more receptive to unexpected versions of the original place.' He takes the pieces of the chime individually and rolls them between thumb and forefinger. Each time he does there is a loud and visible explosion and a creaking sound. These explosions are contained within the thick calluses of the giant's finger pads. Oathmir hums throughout, a deep sound like distant earthquakes. Once he has done this with each he hands the chime back to you. 'That might work for you, though I'm afraid I had to crush the magic that was there before to make the adjustment.'<br />

 Turn in Twisted Chime  to Arch Magus Galsin. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=84161)<br />
<br />
 Arch Mage Galsin says 'This has indeed been modified, but what happened to the enchantment that was on it? Who did you find to do this for you? Nevermind. . . We must find a way of restoring the enchantment to this chime before it can be tested. According to my book Ayonae bestowed the knowledge of these chimes upon the royal family in the Elddar Forest. Perhaps this is the [solution] we're looking for.'<br />

Arch Mage Galsin says, 'With the opening of the portal back to the time of the Takish-Hiz empire we may have access to the powers needed to enchant the chime again. If you can find one of the royal bloodline they may be able to assist us in restoring the enchantment to the chime.'<br />

 <br />
2. Go into The Ruins of Takish-Hiz (static) there you will locate Krylin @ -410, -40 inside of a overturned tower. Hail him to open your instance in the Root of Ro.<br />
 <br />
3. The Root of Ro Instance entrance is to the right of the zone in, along the wall. It is a cave located at: 640, -600 It is HIGH on the wall. Once inside you must collect 5 different tablet items.<br />
 -- The first 4 are random on your way to the boss.<br />
 -- The Boss is melee, yellow to 70, max hit around 1300, drops the final tablet item.<br />
 <br />
 4. Return the Tablets to Tak'Valnakor in North Ro to recieve mission 2.<br />
 <br />
 NOTES: <br />
 -- All other mobs than the ones mentioned above are Dark Blue / White<br />
 -- Treants have a abilitiy called Bark Mulch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8581&amp;source=Live), this is moderate DoT with Snare. MR-200. <br />
 -- Wind Models have an 1200 AE DD, which is FR-400 known as Fire Blast (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8614&amp;source=Live).<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 MISSION 2<br />
 <br />
 1. Talk to Tak'Valnakor @ 6880, -1350 in North Ro. Get task.<br />
 <br />
2. Go to to Queen Tal'Yaliz @ 5950, -2080 in North Ro. She is in a Tower near the Scarb platform. Talking to her ports your group into an instanced version of Ruins of Takish-Hiz.<br />
 <br />
 3. Hunt down 5 Priests. They are yellow con and hit around 1500. They have *alot* of hitpoints. All other mobs are Green/Blue.<br />
 -- Priest One: Located at Building with enterance at 100, -960<br />
 -- Priest Two: Located at Building with enterance at 260, -460<br />
 -- Priest Three: Located at Building with enterance at 130, 100<br />
 -- Priests Four and Five are inside the Palace located at: -13, 135<br />
 <br />
To reach Priest 4: Enter the Palace, clear left. Go down that passage, there is a staircase on your left. Go down the stairs, there is a room to the East. Enter that room. Fouth Priest is in a side room on the left hand side.<br />
 <br />
To Reach Priest 5: Exit the East room where you just in for Priest 4, ther eis a hallway ahead of you, and Archs on the Left and Right. Priest 5 is on the second floor of the Right Arch.<br />
 <br />
4. After slaying the 5 Priests the Prince will spawn in the Amptheater area. Appox Loc is 20, -300. Prince hits 1850ish, but not that fast.<br />
 <br />
 He casts Death's Beckon (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=7046&amp;source=Live) every 60 seconds (single target high powered lifetap) Tank reported it landing for 1800ish. DR - 200.<br />
 <br />
 He also has a AE Curse, which is Curse of Silir (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8957&amp;source=Live). This is a MR -250 check DoT with a trigger. After 30 seconds (and the spell wears off) it fires Curse of Ice Trigger (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8543&amp;source=Live) and you take 8000 Damage unresistable. I am not sur ethe number of curse counters as Lucy does not list the exact number - it says unknown calucation.<br />
 <br />
Thus - it is very important to Resist or Cure (RGC!) the curse as it lands. You can not let it run 30 seconds. (For those Fimilar with Bloodeye and Arch-Magus, similar effect, just its not a DT).<br />
 <br />
 5. After slaying The Prince, talk to Queen Tal'Yaliz in North Ro. <br />
 <br />
 NOTES:<br />
 -- Earth Elementals in this mission cast Stupefy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=8613&amp;source=Live), This effect is MR - 200, lowers Wisdom and Int by 150 (thus decreasing the amount of available mana you have) and lowers Endurance by 200 / tick.

 <br />
2. Go to to Queen Tal'Yaliz @ 5950, -2080 in North Ro. She is in a Tower near the Scarb platform. The player who talks to her will receive the Queen's Crown. Talking to her ports your group into an instanced version of Ruins of Takish-Hiz.<br />

   <br />
Inside the room there is a ramp to the second floor. The Final Priest is up there. He is guarded by 2 Yellow Con Sand Elf Clerics.<br />
   <br />
 Kill The adds and charge the Priest.<br />
   <br />
During the Fight 80/40 percent He calls for help. I noticed on track adds did spawn, but they did not spawn on us, nor did they charge us from this location. This may be bugged.<br />
   <br />
 Kill the Priest and Loot the Signet.[/INDENT]NOTE: You need need to make your way back to the zone in and zone into South Ro.<br />
 <br />
4. Once in South Ro, zone into the non-instanced verison of Ruins of Takish-Hiz. You need to make your way to the Portal to the Elddar Forest located at 103, -177. It appears as a Sand Storm. You need to enter the Elddar Forest.<br />

 <br />
I finished the Ao Arc but dont know where to go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shruella</div><div class="date">02-28-2006, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's telling you that you need to gain access to the Tower. This isn't the stronghold of Sverag he's referring to, but Razorthorne itself.<br />
 <br />
As Rashere said:<br />
 <br />
<br />
Also, after the next patch the &quot;Bring me the head of...&quot; quests within Devastation will reward you with this spell drop as well. The current quest will continue to reward the spell so those of you working on Razorthorne access can get the spell as you're working through it, but this quest wasn't originally designed to reward spell drops and is more time intensive than we'd like for access to those spells.<br />
<br />
 <br />
I think this pretty clearly says that the Saga Skins quest starts out the Razorthorne access arc. However, others have reported that the group mission you get assigned when you finish the Saga Skins task takes several hours for a group to complete, expires 24 hours after you request it, and CANNOT be re-requested without redoing the skins quest. So it makes sense that as Rashere said, they didn't really design the Saga Skins task to be the primary means for acquiring spells. <br />
 <br />
I'm guessing Saga skins was intended to only be completed once per group that wanted to do the Razorthorne access mission from Maelin, and thats why it's such a huge pain. The spell bit was supposed to be a bonus to the single character who took the time to collect all the skins, but the main route for acquiring them was supposed to have been the headhunter quest. Somewhere along the line, that quest got FUBAR'd.<br />
 <br />
At any rate, if I were working on Saga Skins now, I wouldn't whoop for joy and turn in the book when I finished. I'd have some patience and wait for the patch that makes it so the book is No Drop and Maelin won't eat your book anymore - so you will be able to request the Razorthorne access mission whenever you like, instead of being roped into completing the quest within 24 hours of when you get your spell as is currently the case.<br />
 <br />
And incidentally, if you haven't figured it out by now, several of the posters here including the OP of this topic and the moderators, probably knew or guessed the entire access quest from start to finish from their time in Beta, but agreed not to spoil it on these forums until the information became more generally known. That's probably why Nimchip and the OP were going back and forth with all the &quot;neverminds.&quot;  I'm guessing the OP spoiled the entire quest the day after release, and the mods didn't approve.  Everything you need to know to get Theater access is right here in this thread, if you look closely enough.</div></div><hr />

I did think it was slightly sudden. I knew about the quest before I'm just not at the liberty to spoiling such quest due to my guild's duty. I encourage druids to find and finish the quest, you've only my support. I already talked with Wyre about it and he told me he got flamed. Well that's fine, just go on because pretty much you got nothing to lose. Go ahead and finish it.<br />
<br />
Some people have already asked me to remove it but I simply won't. The nerve to even ask me such a thing - which I am both forbidden by the rules and by myself. I even got some people telling some guildmembers (a cleric specifically) that they're &quot;angry&quot; and I simply told the cleric to let him know he can send me a tell any time. You know who you are if you've been monitoring this thread, go ahead and talk with me.<br />

I merely hailed all NPC's as I moved though into the new zones, and found the arch mage.  From there I just followed the  fairly simple rule of 3's.  Now that walkthough you posted does not work.  It might have or maybe the people I know are  bugged, but you can't just turn in the silent chime to Oathmir after getting it from the arch mage.  And completing the skins (or) the vessel mission doesn't work either.  You need to help him find out what is wrong in the tower.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had no spoilers.<br />
<br />
I had no inside info.<br />
<br />
I posted the START of this quest to help the druids and their guild move along the path.  Say what you will about me or my posts.. Nimchip's and my NM posts were  of him and I talking and we cleared out the banter for the rest of the people after he asked to put everyhting into one post.<br />
<br />
This Friday I will put another portion up, and finally the Friday before I move.  This should be ample time for everyone to have run around hailing and squirming.  Use whatever at your own discression.  <br />
<br />
There was some stuff said about it being posted, because all of the top guild are bound to secrecy.. why? competition.  My guild is almost a full expansion behind Assent.  We are still 2 fights from DPoB, and None on our server have evn beat the new OMM.  I respect that these other guild want to keep a lid on it for the copetition between themselves.. I won't hurt most of you that all the information wasn't handed out within the 72 hours  of release, it is something between those guilds and once they've  gone and done and been the first of the server or first of EQ no one will give a hoot.  You can say what you want about me or my posts.. but I won't ruin their fun by saying everything, and if it ruins your fun by not having an instant cheat sheet, I wonoder what you really get out of EQ.... it's like using a game genie err whatever..  What is the point without some actual trial and error?<br />

Now I say again that walkthough is a bit broke, if not ,then the person I did the entire 1st part with yesterday  is completely bugged.. even after completeing the Vessel mission. (which btw, flags at least 30+ people)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As for a lot of what else was said in response to my post, I really wasn't meaning to sound as though I was complaining.  My guild solved the quest a couple days ago and I haven't been running around shouting the details to the world either.  I just happened to notice a few signs in the OP's post, dated the 22nd, that made it pretty clear he had completed a lot more than he was detailing here.  He mentioned the three essential arcs that are needed in the quest up front, without describing the point in the actual doing of the quest where he would have had any rational basis at all for having included the Takish'Hiz missions.</div></div><hr />

And Nimchip.. as a board admin err whatnot, feel free to edit away at my post to make it look pretty or add links to lucy.. feel free.. I'm just tossing general info out to the public..<br />
<br />
Fenier,  I've done the skylance arc twice flagging a toal of 10 people. (5 the 1st time and 5 the second time because I ahd the chime)  If there is something about the mission I didn't post, feel free to say what it is.  Both times, I never noticed any major difference except the 2nd time no one got KB'd.  Most of use have average unbuffed resists over 350-400 so it is possible that a spell was merely resisted.<br />
<br />
All the trash mobs cast an AE slow, every 60 seconds, and some other AE.  The books are part of the 1st named, and upon killing the 2nd named, a few extra trash mobs pop but can be easily avoided.</div></div><hr />

Linking the chime just trigges once sentance from Oathmir to be added to his normal text, saying that he can work the metal.<br />

Once you know He can help you, you read the rest of his text and find that he needs you to go into Razorthorn to find what is happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The longer the Assisant is aggro the more adds spawn, the ones which spawn near you will aggro/add but the ones that spawn on the far side of the room will just wander back and forth.<br />

This happened both times, once near the Portal, and once on his Spawn.<br />

You also can't redo the Saga Skins quest.<br />

When someone in your group turns in the books the Become the Vessel quest comes up and locks so you can't add anyone at that point.  So, if you've done the turn in it looks like the only way to get the mission now is be in a group when one of them does the turn in then go do it. =/<br />
<br />
Anyone know of any other way to get the mission?</div></div><hr />

It will poof then. You also can not get in any other task while that mission is active.  If you leave the task you can't get it back at this point.<br />
<br />
Not sure how the /taskadd is working on it. When I first got the mission 2-28 I could add many people to it. It was late and I had to log. Next day I could no longer add anyone and only had 5 in task (the ones in the group when I got the mission). Logging may have caused that or they may have changed it.</div></div><hr />

Mobsnak... I noticed that as well, I think it was 3-5 mobs total?  KB also seems to be non-existant after one of the early PoR patches.<br />

I would say the best info needed right now is missing dialogues, exact mob names, and exact task steps.<br />
<br />
I won't have much time to update this due to my real life commitments, but I'm sure if you post some info it can be added in.</div></div><hr />

We pull all his books first, then pull him off his platform.  That way there are no adds at all.  He emotes for them, but none pop.  Also, if he has an AE we resisted every single shot of it because I never noticed one at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyre Wintermute</div><div class="date">03-13-2006, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is true for the East Assistant (to the right from portal)<br />
The books do come alive but they are stationary until aggro'd.  You can single pull the East Assistant off his platform and have no issues with his books at all during the fight.  The books from his battle can aggro across when you try the mob on the left however.  You can do as you state also and single pull the books off the East(right) platform and the assistant will do his normal script trying to activate one every 10%, but since they are dead it is of no concequence.<br />
<br />
Now what Fenier and I had posted is about the West Assistant (left from portal).  He has no Books that should spawn, but there are Scrykin Bookworm that do spawn.  They are the same model as the inital trash mobs.  They aren't -adds- so to speak, they pop along the main ring and path around it.  Their pathing is horrific so it is possible to get all of them aggro'd if you fight on the main ring and yet also possible to have all these adds pop and finish the mission without ever aggroing them.<br />
Your best bet for this West(left) Assistant is still to engage on his platform, then assess what to do to complete the mission (how to pull the new mobs or avoid them etc..).<br />

 <br />
- 3 lab attendants spawn when egg is placed, a bit away at first so should be no biggie to get them under control. <br />
 <br />
- EVERY time you use a machine an add spawns no matter if the click was correct or not, on correct clicks it's the usual lab attendant, nothing really dangerous. <br />
 <br />
- after a while (halfway after clicking 4-5 of the 8 steps) another 3 attendants pop 1 by 1 - assuming it's the repop of 1st wave, we were slow killing http://www.eqlegendary.com/dev/phpBB2/images/smiles/icon_redface.gif  <br />
 <br />
- eye of zoom is rumored to be nerfed, so you can't click with it anymore, but we had no aggro problems clicking the machines manually. <br />
 <br />
- after 8 correct clicks the boss spawns as usual. <br />
 <br />
- seems like sometimes chime and spell reward is still bugged, try hailing Ao for chime if you only got spell - or have to do it double worst-case.<br />

Anyone else confirm?  Also using an Eye of Zomm now counts as a failed click.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
And you're right about mobs and adds.. We had 3-4 lab attendance in center for a long time because one person insited on clicking stuff and we had a low dps group that couldn't beat it. We finally convinced him to stop clicking, killed all the mobs, then continued and beat it with no problems.</div></div><hr />
