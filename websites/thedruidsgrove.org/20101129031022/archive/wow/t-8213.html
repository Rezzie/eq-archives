You must not be a very high level player, or simply do not take note of what the other classes around you are able to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally i'd like to see Dire bear (and bear i guess) forms AC scale, as well as cat form's  dps.  Having a single main stat would be nice too :) and perhaps a dire cat form, but come on, at some point i have to be wishing too much :P</div></div><hr />

That would fix the DPS problem.  They could implement it easy enough as either part of the form, Dire Cat form or a skill purchased with an appropriate number of points.  <br />
<br />
More AC on bear form would help or give it some form of HP or regeneration buff, after all, It IS a big bear...  <br />
<br />
Change root to hold better and take away the damage would be a good fix also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">12-15-2004, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dual wield wouldn't affect it a great deal. Dual wield is gimpy DPS wise if you're fighting things above your level... it increases your miss rate, which is more prounced on things above your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, with Duel Wield you might see more misses, but you will also see many more hits. It's a conciderable DPS upgrade and this is coming from my experience going from lvl 9 to lvl 10 as a rogue (we get DW at lvl 10). It makes a hudge difference for us.<br />
<br />
But for druids, I don't know if that will work all too well. The forums do grant you the abilities of other classes, but just to a limit.<br />
<br />
Problem I think is people don't respect the class enough for itself. A druid is a jack of trades in this game, but the master of none.  I see druids as a compliment class more than anything else. And I have no problems having a druid or not in my group/raid (mostly cause I'm force too since Rahj co-leads the guild with me. :lol: :p).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">12-16-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Testing shows that it IS a large DPS jump..but only when the mobs are below your level. Your base miss rate jumps from something like 5% to 25%, which is very prounced on things even two levels above you. That comes from my own experience as a rogue for 30~ levels, as well as testing done in beta. As a rogue, if you take dual wield specialization the gap is a lot closer on higher than you mobs, when comparing dual wield to a single weapon + held in hand item.</div></div><hr />
