<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daldaen</div><div class="date">01-24-2008, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since SoF has come out, gear has taken a substantional jump in quality compared to previous gear available to groupable content. So I decided to make a profile for the best possible group obtained gear only for a druid. And so far I've reached 16.6k HP and 18.1k Mana unbuffed. This is with all AAs and the best gear to date (with exception of several visable slots namely because the T4 gear isn't on magelo yet and the weapon, didn't really look for a better one from Crystallos where nearly 100% of the gear is from). As for the augs I tried to go for a split between HP and Mana but when they dropped much below a 90/90 split I went for straight mana (only in two or three slots I believe). This profile is unlikely to be reached because of the rarity of some of the augs and the amount of time you would have to live and breath Crystallos. But this is a guide to the best grouped drops out there :). If you have any updates on gear post them here or if I have something that isn't groupable tell me.<br />

Goodluck.<br />
 <br />
A side note, this toon would put you ranked as the 42nd best druid serverwide manawise, as of today 01/24/08! Which is amazing for just gear from grouped content!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Most mid tier raiders are using this zone as their candy land right now.<br />
 <br />
My gu is considered family gu but we raid with others and only 3 folks are flagged and all 3 went with the mid tier guilds doing the flagging.<br />
 <br />
BUT it is nice to see what is out there!</div></div><hr />

Flagging for Crystallis takes a good group a day.  I have a monk friend that hasn't raided in a year that's wearing better leather than I am, and my guild is #15 serverwide.<br />
 <br />
Granted at the end of the day my gear may end up being better, but we're talking months of progression.</div></div><hr />

You can get gimped in by working on it with a lot of people but my friend is 4500ac tank and they had 4k ac warrior and it took 8 people alot of time to get that quest done.<br />
 <br />
Your average group is not going to be a 4k ac tank ....our pally is total group pally and he is 3kac......now is it possible to piggy back w/other guilds flagging and such yes of course.<br />
 <br />
But don't act like any blow jow grouper can get this stuff.</div></div><hr />

Good things to shoot for.</div></div><hr />
