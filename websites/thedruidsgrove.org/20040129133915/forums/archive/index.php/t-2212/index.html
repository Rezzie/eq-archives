<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>winwell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, SoE didnt tell us it was changed, so I will tell you what has changed. Previously you only handed in the 3 trapped souls to Grenric to receive the key/flag, however ya want to put it, and you kept your box of souls. Now he wants all 3 soulds AND the box of souls. I was hoping to flag a few groups but I guess gonna have to get the box again over and over to do this. <br />
<br />
So just a heads up to anyone working on this quest. It does group a flag, but he requires all 4 components now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, they changed this about a day after they implemented group flagging.<br />
<br />
I was hoping to have an infinite platinum source.  Oh well, 30k profit and hoh access for doing the quest wasn't bad.</div></div><hr />
