The Websense category &quot;Games&quot; is filtered.<br />
<br />
Quoted from a website explaining how Websense works:<br />
Websense filters Internet content by working in conjunction with the Websense Master Database of more than 3.7 million sites, organized into 81 categories, including MP3, gambling, shopping and adult content. You can choose to block, permit, limit by time-based quota or postpone access to individual categories by user, group, workstation or network.</div></div><hr />

I setup my home PC as a proxy server back in the days of high school. I used free proxy (http://www.handcraftedsoftware.org/index.php?page=5). Most people wise up to this and some ISPs forbid it so make sure you're not using the standard port and anonymous access is turned off.</div></div><hr />

It was in the equipment discussion forum.  I think the topic was Feral Gear. . .or something of the like.<br />
<br />
Also. . .did it ever occur to any of you who are ragging at us that we may be doing this in between calls?  When there is no work to do?  Just a thott.  <br />

You're just mad because your job doesn't allow for any fun.  :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">11-22-2005, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My entire philosophy of work... well and life too for that matter... is pretty much &quot;If your job gets done, I could care less what else you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you were some kind of genius, could do your whole days work in 5 minutes, and it was done well, the other 7 hours and 55 minutes don't concern me. Play games, post sites, look up porn, have sex on your desk with your amazingly cool and hot, but married co-worker how is that anyone's else's business as long as you don't interfer with them doing their work.<br />
<br />
Of course someone who could do a whole days work in 5 minutes probably could do a different for more money. If you have extra time to hang out on the forums, like I do, you could probably go out, get a job that requires you to work non-stop for eight hours and pays you better for it. But at this point in my life, and I'm sure in a lot of others lives as well, I would rather keep my sanity and easygoing disposition, and settle with what I currently do.<br />
<br />
In any case. As long as the people depending on you to do your job aren't disapointed, who cares what else you do. Its supposed to be mutually benneficial work, not indentured servitude.<br />
