<br />
I know this is a very silly question, but did I do something significant?  People have started asking me if I am Aldor or Scryer.  <br />
<br />
All I did was choose an Inn to make my home.  Right???<br />
<br />
PS - Have I mentioned that I play the game for fun and friends and not so much for the technical aspects?  :p</div></div><hr />

Merely setting your Inn at a certain faction does not ally you with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gotta learn more about this, but the WoW site doesn't really tell me much.....</div></div><hr />

Nobody has attacked me, and I've been all over Shat.  Quite certain I haven't (knowingly, at least) completed the &quot;choose your faction&quot; quest.  (I feel like such a goof.)  Gonna search around for the quest-giver.  <br />
<br />
Raging Epistaxis - TY for the Comparison Site.  It's quite informative.  However, I think it's a rather tough decision for Druids. <br />
<br />
May I ask what all of you have chosen and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">09-01-2007, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know its stupid, but i have chosen Aldor becouse i dont like the blood elves :)<br />
One of the bad sides is that i have died like a million times missing that stupid elevator...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">09-01-2007, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When my druid gets to a level where he needs to choose, I'll probably go Aldor, but mainly because my Hunter is already Scryer.<br />
<br />
Both factions have rewards / items for sale that appear to be of interest to druids, IMO.<br />
<br />
And it's not simple, but one can always change allegiances if it sucks too badly. (or you've got all the Phat loot one side has to offer... :)   )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">09-01-2007, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm Aldor, but I don't think the difference is so much class-dependent as profession and role dependent (healer, tank, melee or caster DPS). It's also a function of what patterns in your profession your guild may need. If you're the guild's fifth best alchemist and all the others have gone Aldor, you could offer some potions that are only available to Scryer (this is a hypothetical example, I don't know what alchemy recipes are offered by whom).<br />
<br />
Regarding being attacked by guards, my understanding is that it's rep dependent. Until you've done enough quests to become hostile to the opposing faction, I don't think they'll attack you.<br />
<br />
Yep, I've missed that stupid elevator countless times too. How embarrassing. But it's not an issue once you ding 68 and get flight form. Instant cast FTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">09-02-2007, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, flight form has saved me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">09-04-2007, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya....I did the quest and chose Aldor.  I'm told they are the &quot;good guys&quot; + I already had a bunch of marks that I could turn in.<br />
<br />
BTW - After this, I took the &quot;wrong&quot; elevator down into Scryer territory.  Hee Hee....the guards threw me and my mount around like a rag doll.  It was hilarious.  On the up side, it is entertaining AND it's a rather quick way out of the city!<br />
<br />
I haven't tried the Scryer bank yet (my mount won't go near it!):p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">09-04-2007, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can actually wander freely into either bank, but the bankers won't do business with you if they're hostile. Fortunately, you can't attack them by right clicking on them accidentally. I can't count the number of times I've wandered into the Scryer bank with my lone Aldor char.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your a druid.... and use the elevator in Shat..<br />
<br />
YOUR WRONG!!!!<br />
<br />
flight form!!!<br />
<br />
nothing like running off the edge of aldor area and jumping as people watch... then shift to flight form<br />
<br />
that and fly'n circles around the scryer guards is a freaking blast... they ALMOST will follow you to the ramp leading to the aldor areas</div></div><hr />

<br />
And don't think I won't be asking all of you for info on the Flight Form quest when I am eligible!  :wavey:</div></div><hr />

<br />
i just want to finish the epic flight form.... can't get past the heroci seth hall....<br />
<br />
but still dive bombing guards is a blast</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">09-06-2007, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm. I've never had a problem with the Heroic Sethekk fight, have done it several times both for Druids needing the quest and for fun and possible nifty mount. What seems to be the problem when you try it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">09-06-2007, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you hurry, you can kite Anzu out of his room and not have to deal with his adds....then when he banishes himself get a Mass Dispell to pop him out and he will just sit there and not move, allowing for some massive damage to be dealt.<br />
<br />
After the patch though he'll leash and won't like being kited anymore.<br />
<br />
Plus with the &quot;res in an instance&quot; trick, you can literally get to him within a 15 minutes or so with a good group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">09-07-2007, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought they fixed Anzu already so that he can't be kited far... I haven't done the fight yet myself so I don't know how FAR you have to kite him but I remember the patch notes saying something really general like he cannot be kited very far =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">09-07-2007, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True but kiting him to Ikiss's room can be done.<br />
<br />
At least it could be when I did my Epic Flight Form quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weaselking1973</div><div class="date">09-07-2007, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">main problem... PUG gruops<br />
<br />
its nearly impossible to find a decent pug group to run heroics.<br />
<br />
people are very picky for the simple fact.. its 1 run a day..<br />
<br />
tanking in'st the issue, nor the mobs... its findig a capable healer for it.</div></div><hr />
