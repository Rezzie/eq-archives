Gear suggestions are always welcomed too and maybe a tradeskill choice aswell was thinking tailoring as i will get pelts from hunting. Thanks in Advance and if anyone else is planning on playing on new server let me know.</div></div><hr />

Levels 25-35:  South Karana aviaks and splitpaw (outside)<br />
Levels 30-40:  Rathe Mountains giants and cyclops<br />
Levels 40-50:  OoT Cyclops Isle, TD Raptor Isle<br />
<br />
Baking will serve you will both early and throughout.  Tailoring is ok since will be getting pelts.  Brewing is very useful as well.</div></div><hr />

Easy to solo all componets for this http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=14483 and they can sell for 6k a pop. Happy hunting</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, are certain zones like HHK, and the Tesch ma gnoll den in sk, still have 35 percent exp bonuses?<br />
<br />
Also, with regards to soloing those spots listed above, isnt that generally slower than grouping</div></div><hr />
