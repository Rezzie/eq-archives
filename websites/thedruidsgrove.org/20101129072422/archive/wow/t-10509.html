You have a 1 in 20 chance of getting a decent pug that doesn't /afk after the opposing side gets one flag. Or, I seem to have a 5 to one chance of getting the full out decked rep rarmers where I might as well go hide undersomething or get gy camped while they clean house.<br />
That being said..<br />
I have noticed while I may be good at dusting everyone running the flag, I've found I'm even better at flag runner support.I can stop 3 or so alliance and help the runner get a nice lead then catch up to him to offer support again. If I'm running the flag and I try to make a mad dash I ditch my support and if I run into someone up the road I might be in trouble(even if I kill them by the time their dead their support has caughtup).<br />
Has anyone else tried just doing support instead of running the flag?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've run the support route, usually with a rouge since I can keep up with their sprint.<br />
<br />
So long as the team is even slightly organized we are better carriers.  <br />
<br />
- shift out of movement imparing debuffs<br />
- run hella fast ( especially with 4 pieces for the PvP gear *nods*...on Tuesday I will finally be able to keep up with Kane )<br />
- self healing<br />
- did I mention run hella fast<br />
- and when / if you get into trouble you go bear and stay alive long enough for your support to get there too<br />
<br />
Usually just have a priest / lock mid field to toss a fear out there or a mage to frost nova everyone and you're home free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually I tell in /raid just before I grab the flag and have someone meet me midfield to offer support.</div></div><hr />

I agree tho' eveything that makes us great flag carriers makes us excellent support for others.  We can always catch up, can't be poly'ed or rooted, have good heals and effective ways of stopping/slowing would be attackers.  Plus, I find if a non-healer is carrying then the Damage of the other team is going to be  split between people trying to kill the healer and people trying to kill the carrier.<br />
<br />
With team support, Warrior, Paly and Druid are the top carriers.  Mages and Shaman also do alright.  The rest are the clear bottom of the heap... I'd go with priest as the worst, altho warlocks, hunters and rogues are right up there.  Maybe in the lower pre-mount brakets hunters and rogues are a bit better off with their run speed buffs... but at 60 :devil-lau</div></div><hr />

If you can get into a regular team with good leadership and use TS/Vent, your success will make things a lot more fun. In my opinion, Arathi Basin is far more fun and can be much better organized.  WSG has too much opportunity for people to scatter.</div></div><hr />

The best runners will grab the flag and go cat to dash out of the flag room, then when dash fades, shift caster for an HoT, then drop to cheetah to run, shifting out of cc as necessary, then when you get to your base go bear for the extra defense and hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes!!, you can which is why we are so great at carrying. Grab in human, shift cat, dash out of flag room, shift travel, shift out to heal and out of cc, shift back for the speed. Self-healing fast running flag carrier FTW!!!</div></div><hr />

Anyone saying some other class is better at flagrunning then druid is smoking crack really. Ask any end game guild, druid ROCK at flag running.</div></div><hr />

I love to wait on the roof in stealth while group engages the defenders, then hop down, shift to caster grab the flag and run. I use the short exit (not the tunnel) so I can hit travel form and *poof* I am gone.</div></div><hr />

We can still shift out of trapping/slowing effects, but we are no longer immune to them for a brief few moments after shifting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, I carried last night 2/3 times in one session and 1/3 in two others with no problems. My favorite tactic in PUG is to let the uberlicous types charge in an take on the defense, then hop down from the upper level, grab the flag, and bolt out via the center ramp so I can break LOS and switch to fast kitty asap. They can't snare/stun/root/fear what they can't catch. *smile*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better Mitigation (particularly against magic)<br />
Warriors can't heal Druids<br />
They never get caught in a 'squishy' form<br />
<br />
There ya go' :sumo: <br />
<br />
Not to say we aren't great at it, and better then warriors when it comes to solo or two man flag grabs.</div></div><hr />

Stopped my druid at rank 11. I'm 14/32/5 spec and running flags is all I do. It's the most fun I've found in WoW thus far.<br />
<br />
I run with a relatively normal pool of people, have a vent that supports them and we constanty run against other teams.<br />
<br />
I can normally run the flag without much support. Bash, Charge, MC cap and Rocket Helm work wonders when you're a flagrunner.<br />
<br />
The 6pc. set bonus from the PvP gear (+15% run speed increase in forms) works pretty well too.  =)</div></div><hr />

We used to have a 1 second immunity. If a mage started casting frostbolt, I could shift in and out of travel and when it hit I would be immune. Has since been patched...much to my dismay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the right group ( enough healers and people that can keep the fears coming ) a warrior is a great runner as you just  keep healing him ( what little healing he needs ), rooting the on comers and switch travel to catch up to him.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I was on a 14 game win streak this weekend when our group fell apart and we lost one.  <br />
<br />
We had one game with 5 druids.  Seeing us all in travel form running to the tunnel was quite the scene.  Roots were flying everywhere, the heals and then 3 hunters a warrior and a lock.  Good times :)</div></div><hr />

Just rember the pet isn't the threat.  Any hunter who's using his speed aura to keep up deserves the jump/spin/moonfire to get'm dazed.<br />

I dream of the day I get to sleep a shammy... they never, ever use ghostwolf in duels.</div></div><hr />

So I still say druids are the best runners.. wars are too easy to CC.<br />

I rather have a pally as a runner than a war tbh. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elody</div><div class="date">07-05-2006, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just made a druid to play low level BGs on a brand new server.  So far, on the alliance side on Aerie Peak, we lose almost always because we have no organization in terms of healing the carrier, stopping the horde offense, intercepting their carrier and healing each other.  I find myself healing more than priests but I also carry the flag a lot.   Though I really prefer a paladin run the flag or a beefy warrior so I can keep them healed instead of me wasting massive mana shifting in and out of movement impairing effects.  Also some other druids I always see trying to dps when clearly they should be healing as dpsing at 10-19 in bear is laughable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played BG's as both Horde and Alliance (Druid &amp; Priest).  I have to say that Horde are definitely more organized on the servers I have played on.  The Alliance tend to be every man/woman for himself/herself.  <br />
<br />
I have done many BG's on one of my other Druids, and let me tell you I love doing WSG as a Druid.  There were times I would log on and get tells immediately telling me to get in the queue because they needed a flag carrier with a plan or something.  <br />
<br />
I do love healing the FC's and I love being the FC.....but nothing is as much fun as rooting their FC or just some random enemy in the mid-field.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">07-06-2006, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how much of this is common knowledge outside the warrior community, but there is currently a bug that makes warriors incredible flag carriers.<br />
<br />
The bug is in the item they get for a class quest called the diamond flask.  One of its effects is a health regen (health/5 type effect).  The bug is that the rate of regen is effected by +healing gear PER TICK, so while I believe it starts at 9 hp/ 5 sec, if they are using +100 healing gear they get 109 hp/5 sec for an entire minute.<br />
<br />
While you might not think this is something to worry about because warriors don't usually use healing gear, think again.  Many heavy PvP warriors are now toting 2 healing weapons in their bags (dual wielding) with healing enchants that they can swap out in combat if necessary to give them thousands of health at a tough rate to overcome or even match with DoTs. Of course there are also some healing shields in the game used currently by Paladins.<br />
<br />
A warrior in my guild that already had rep with AB is now dual wielding Mindfangs now and is looking to put healing enchants on each for a total of +170 to heal just on weapons; He is also considering the healing enchant on his bracers and gloves to put him over 200.</div></div><hr />
