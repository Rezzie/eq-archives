WIlling to do DoNs if the gear is worth it. Looking for suggestions on what/where/how to get if possible. <br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thornsong</div><div class="date">05-10-2005, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking at your gear, the thing that screams out to me is that you do not have augs.  When I look at someone who apps to my guild, I don't care what gear they have, but what aug set they have.  That shows me how much they care about their character.<br />
<br />
Augs is the gear that you do for yourself for the most part.  Guilds will give you gear, but augs are pretty much up to you until you get in a big guild.  If I were you I would concentrate on getting some augs.  Then as your gear improves, you can move the aug with you.<br />
<br />
Since you have no augs, there is a few that you can get pretty easy.  I would recommend doing DoNs and saving up for the 50 hp or mana augs, whichever you prefer.  I believe in mana over hps after you hit 7k buffed, hps until you hit that personally.  There is 10+ augs you can purchase from DoN.<br />
<br />
I would also get a few people and do some Tipt aug runs.  There is a 3 augs that drop there that would help you a lot.  The first one is a 30hp 30mana aug called a Gem of Bolstered Power, the next is a 30hp 30 endurance aug and the third is a +2mana regen/regen aug.  What you do is get an expedition, clear/invis up to the first boss, kill it, then drop expedition and rinse and repeat and you can get the augs pretty quick.<br />
<br />
I would also try to get a group to do the Corruption trial in MPG.  This is by far the easiest of the trials and one of its rewards is a 60hp 60mana aug.  There is also several MPG trial loots that would be beneficial to you, but they may be more difficult unless you tag along with some well-geared friends.  The good side to that is druids are very versatile in the trials.<br />
<br />
LDON normals at your level are cake if you bring along some lower level 60s to bring the mobs down if you want to grab the 5 40hp/40 mana or 20hp/20 mana augs from there.<br />
<br />
Kodtaz also has some 35hp and 35 mana rings along with a 50hp 50 mana aug you can camp.</div></div><hr />

Another thing you can easily do solo is go to nobles causeway and kill murkglider for the 4 pieces of the quest cloak.  This cloak had ID and good stats, would be a nic upgrade for you.  Killing in NC would also give you a chance at the rare zonewide drops, two of which are very nice (belt is perhaps slightly better than silverine in some ways, and the other is a nice shield).  <br />
<br />
DON augs would be the better way to go, but if you find Ldon is still actively being run on your server those arent too bad either.<br />
