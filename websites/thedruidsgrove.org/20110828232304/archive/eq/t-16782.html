Also has a druids role changed mouch in the last 2 years? Where should I be focusing my AA and at what lvl is a good time to start filling that AA bar instead of the XP bar? Thanks for any help</div></div><hr />

In your case I would go ahead and get level 65, because that opens up new gear and aa's to purchase. I would focus on all the healing, nuking, and dot aa's mainly. If you don't plan on grouping at all then you can hold off on the healing aa's, but I wouldn't suggest it. Also work on convergence of spirits and spirit of the wood lines. Radiant cure, entrap, storm strike, nature's guardian, innate/shared camo, and defensive aa's are very nice to have....be sure to get them as they become available.<br />
Anywhere that has alot of animals you can charm is great for xp. I used to hate it, but now it's all I do when solo. You really want both level of entrap and innate camo for this though. It will make life so much easier.</div></div><hr />

You can work on AAs at any level, but as you get higher in level the expansions you're working through assume you have more and more AAs.  Most people I know around that level go to BoT and grind out a bunch while grouping up to 70.  The group role that I've seen since I got back from a similar break was mostly the same, backup healing, dpsing, and occasionally main healing. Good luck getting back into the swing of things!</div></div><hr />

Also nadox is a hotzone and you should be able to solo there with lil problems.</div></div><hr />
