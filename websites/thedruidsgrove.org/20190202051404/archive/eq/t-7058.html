He says it will help me get exp so much faster, getting all the other AAs becomes way easier.<br />
<br />
Im not convinced that it is worth the 9 AAs to me right now.  I just dont solo all that much anymore.<br />
<br />
So far I have 18 aa spent (run 3, metabolism 3, scf 2 and scm 2).  <br />
<br />
Those of you that already have dire charm, is it work putting off exodus, innate camo, MGB, SotW, etc to get dire charm first?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Dire Charm equates to another of a Druid's &quot;cheap party tricks&quot; like summoning Booboo.  If you get a great deal of use out of Booboo than you *might* get *some* from Dire Charm.  DC is like buying a low grade DoT... somewhere between Stinging Swarm and Drones of Doom.  The real catch is, first you have to FIND a charmable greenie.  If you just want to charm animals, get yourself Command of Tunare and forget DC forever.  If I could get back my 9 points I spent for DC I would definitely put them towards something useful the next time I spent them.<br />
<br />
I would recommend first and foremost:  innate camo<br />
<br />
After you have that, I could suggest others but in all honesty, it depends on how you play EQ.  I added the healing foci (gift and adept) then Exodus, but if you group in LDoNs or exp groups a lot you might prefer Exodus first and then the healing foci.</div></div><hr />

At best, dire charm will be a small damage boost for a group, provided you can actually drag that stupid pet from the enterance and it never has to tank.<br />
<br />
Though it had limited utility in the Kunark days, Dire Charm for druids is a total waste now.  I think I've used it once or twice in the past year.  Innate Camouflage and Exodus, by comparison, are priceless.  Once you get into the 400+ AA realm, you might want to do Dire Charm for kicks.</div></div><hr />

No AA has had as great an impact on how I play the game as Innate Camo.<br />
<br />
Dire Charm is amusing, but as stated above, a party trick at best. It's mostly a fun toy useful for farming Rockhopper Hides, romping around Natambi for twink gear, or other such activities. Don't expect to get decent XP out of it. <br />
<br />
If you're looking to add AAs that will improve your ability to XP effectively, go for crit nukes. It sounds like right now you're around the range where you'll start quadding HoH soon, the XP there is very good, and you'll notice a significant improvement as your AAs/gear improve. (at first you'll get it down to where you can quad without having to resnare, then the amount of med-kiting drops off slowly) It has the added bonus of being useful AAs when grouping, and being equally effective once you &quot;graduate&quot; to PoFire and start kiting at the tables or bird spot.</div></div><hr />

If you're a soloing druid without any flowing thought then get dire charm early and build up your AAs quick. If you're a raiding druid with good gear then you'll have plenty of alternative ways to get anything done so get dire charm fairly late.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dire charm is a nice extra for grouping though.  Depending on where you're hunting you can usually get an extra 70-120 or so dps out of it, mana free.  (Well, it's mana free if you have a sand eroded shell from nadox.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm sorry but i dont agree.<br />
The DC pet in HoH is a 50+ DPS haste it and buff it and it can be more DPS and as long as you have epic + using some dots to hurt the mob it will take very little xp.<br />
Now the question that you realy should ask yourself is<br />
Do I plan on doing lots of solo XP? <br />
if the answer is yes then by all mean DC charm is one of the best investment you will make, it will pay back the XP in very short time, agro kiteing using the DC pet in HoH is about 40% faster then without pet so figure for yourself if it's worth it.<br />
If the answer is no then just forget it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dire charm really depends on your patience and playstyle.  You can dire charm in most zones in PoP, as SOE has seen fit to put a DC pet in every one for you to work with.<br />
<br />
With haste and other buffs, the DC pet can be a beast putting out a good deal of dps in a normal exp group.  IE, your not running around kiting.  If your kiting he's a pain in the ass as you have to keep your aggro up which actually lowers your dps.<br />
<br />
As far as solo'ing goes?  I don't do it anymore unless I cannot get a group, and even then I'm not real keen on it.  Since the last major exp changes, it takes longer to get an AA solo than with a full group.<br />
<br />
In GoD Dire Charm is useless, so I'd forgo it there.<br />

That is probably our best place to be DPS-wise.  Even as main healer, you can still add dmg via your DC pet.  I just did a 3 druid + cleric + Chanter + Pallie group in earth for about 6 hours straight.  It was great having 4 DC pets!<br />
<br />
If you're not elemental or don't group a lot in PoV/PoN/CoD/PoJ/PoS or any old world zones like Chardok, then I would say skip it and get innate camo and exodus first.  Personally, I powered to DC very fast because I was soloing Chardok at the time.<br />
<br />
It's a good skill and fun to have, but situational at best.  However, the same can be said about many of our AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggo</div><div class="date">03-22-2004, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nobody has mentioned SotW which I regard as our best AA personally (in terms of solo, group and raid [with MGB of course] functionality.<br />
<br />
Innate camo is certainly a &quot;how did I get by without this before?&quot; type of AA and allows you to do certain things that you just cant do with invis, but a stack of cloud potions will do much the same.<br />
<br />
Exodus saves lives AND spell slots.<br />
<br />
My personal list would be:<br />
<br />
Wood 1<br />
RC 1<br />
Innate camo<br />
<br />
Where you go from there is up to you - if you raid MGB plus more in wood and RC.  I would complete SCM before SCF.  And probably grab MC (at least 1 and 2).  Certainly there are a lot of good AAs which will keep you busy for a wee while yet!!</div></div><hr />

Your question is a good one, and applies to more decisions than just DC.  IMO, you *should* aim for abilities that will increase your rate of xp gain early on.  I picked up exodus as soon as I could, to allow myself to push the limits of safe soloing (charm) without risking needing a rez or eating an xp death.  I'd recommend you do the same.<br />
<br />
SCM3, MC1&amp;2 will probably help you more than DC, considering you don't solo much anymore.  Innate camo and Spirit of the Wood are both great AAs too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did get innate camo, RC, exodus, Sotw, MC1, SCM3 all before DC though and I would recommend anyone getting those first (except possibly RC if you don't raid at all).  They are all great boosts!</div></div><hr />

I would never say druids suck compared to other DPS classes.  We can stand toe to toe with anyone.  Druids don't suck at anything, that's why we're so great.   :buttrock: <br />

For HoH, it isnt very useful because it is usually a pain to get the mini pets to a decent xp spot unlesss you use warping tricks, and even then you are better off quad-kiting, where it isnt worth the pain to keep a DC pet around as you may need to use innate cammo and it could overaggro/die easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DC is a very situational ability, it is sometimes useful in HoH, if you have elemental access, some few other zones.  So DC has been useful in a limited way, not a top choice by any means.<br />
<br />
<br />
BUT, and this is a big change, DC is now extremely useful in Natimbi.  If you have any plans to hunt there for exp or drops then you want DC.  Grab a light blue hynid buzzsaw, buff and get cheal memmed.  Works great if you are trying to get the extremely rare neck items to drop.  The pet will have trouble taking out some of the higher level zone mobs but with propper timing of heals he will do well.<br />

<br />
With the correct focus effects and the LDoN dot, I now agro a wrulon in HoH and take him to &quot;left hero&quot; while invised and DC him there.  Then I can put down 20 guards per hour soloing, or one AA every 57 mins.  Yes, the Sentrys can't be snared but you can easily kite them w/ flame lick and let pet kill them when they do pop.<br />
<br />
This is the best solo xp i've found, even better than PoF soloing, while nothing can beat PoF tables group though.  This XP is comparable to a decent PoE group, so considering you don't have to put up the hassles of putting a group together, I think DC is a wonderful AA, it has paid for itself many times over.</div></div><hr />

Do they have DC pets?<br />
<br />
For me, DC was fantastic. PoV, PoN, and CoD pre ele, PoE (mostly) and PoFire (some). <br />
<br />
My RL brother in law came back to our server, his shaman was only 56 (his other shaman was already 65) and we wanted to get him up to our level quickly so he could apply to our guild. 2 weeks grouping in PoV he was 65 with ~15-20 AA (it's been a while). It works great in CoD and PoE. Once you learn pathing in PoV it is really nice as well. Group makeup was 65 dru and 56-65 shm with occationally 65 clr or 65 enc alt in addition.<br />
<br />
In PoE, it's the rare druid that doesn't have DC, even if they have low AAs (as far as I've encountered). It is almost expected, and there is a noticable difference in kill rate with and without DC pets.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say it helped me gain xp faster after getting it, but again, look to the zones you find yourself most often grouping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way they work today is:<br />
<br />
Pets take 75% of the exp IF you do zero (0) damage.<br />
<br />
If you do at least 1pt of damage (not a damage shield), then the pet takes 0% exp.  You can use flame lick or a ceramic band or do your max DPS, its all the same.<br />
 <br />
In places like HoH and other DC pet zones listed above (and several more zones that have not been listed), DC pets rule.  I just did the HoH GY this week with two other DC druids, and once we all had pets, the exp was good.  The pulling druid would get 4-8 mobs, and each died in under 2 circuits of the GY.  I got 3aa in 2 hours.  With a couple days of exp like this, DC will have paid for itself.  <br />
 <br />
When you don't have much time to play, DC is great.  Use a pet to farm faction or supplies, or hit PoP zones for some AA exp without wasting precious time LFG.<br />
 <br />
You might eventually stop using DC very much if you stop adventuring in PoP.  But eventually you will get steeloak and stop casting nines, too.  Does that mean you don't need the spell?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Posted by Tatankawd a while back:<br />
<br />
<br />
Last year:<br />
<br />
Situation 1 - You are soloing and you have a summoned pet or a charmed pet (not including Dire Charm)-<br />
* If you do any damage to the monster at all, you get all of the experience.<br />
* If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.<br />
<br />
Situation 2 - You are in a group and you have a summoned pet or a charmed pet (not including Dire Charm)-<br />
* If you or your group do any damage to the monster at all, your group gets all of the experience.<br />
* If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.<br />
<br />
Situation 3 - You are soloing and you have a Dire Charmed pet-<br />
* If you do half of the damage to the monster or more, you get all of the experience.<br />
* If you do less than half of the damage to the monster, the pet gets between 25% and 50% of the experience, depending on how much damage it did.<br />
* If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.<br />
<br />
Situation 4 - You are in a group and you have a Dire Charmed pet-<br />
* If you or your group do half of the damage to the monster or more, your group gets all of the experience.<br />
* If you or your group do less than half of the damage to the monster, the pet gets between 25% and 50% of the experience, depending on how much damage it did.<br />
* If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
And April patch comment:<br />
<br />
Charm Changes<br />
<br />
Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for the healer.<br />
Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC killed. This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to the target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same experience they always have.<br />
Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target if there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.</div></div><hr />
