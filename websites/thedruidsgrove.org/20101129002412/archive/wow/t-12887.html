I was looking at something like http://http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0AGbzVcobZZf0Iubuxmzh  <br />
 <br />
Would be interesting to maybe level with that build (going to be TONS of tanks for all instances with everyone leveling a DK), but I think I'm gonna have to go feral again.  <br />
 <br />
Maybe something like this at 80:  http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0AGbzVcobZZf0Iubuxmzh<br />

Also, even with a full tanking spec as a feral you should do fine against mobs - especially now, that they have increased tank DPS.</div></div><hr />

I, for one, will be going Dreamstate as well (at least until I start raiding again at 80).....so, if anyone has some uber Dreamstate links (with the new talents - of course) it would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I actually leveled my priest from 20-66 by just instancing!  It was slow, becuase there weren't many groups until outland, but instance + rested XP = huge leveling potential.</div></div><hr />

I think what I linked was something like this for a dreamstate build:<br />

I actually just respec'd into 61 points balance yesterday after the free respec, and lolbignumbers.  My boomkin gear is weak (basically all my pvp healing gear), but I was impressed.  I'd like to try it out in Kara, or some instancee, but doing dailies on the Isle was a breeze.<br />

My cat dps is amazing (not competetive, but far more than good enough) in full bear spec, so going Dreamstate should allow me access to all 4 druid roles with the two specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-07-2008, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i was soo tempted to respec oomkin following the free talent refund on wednesday but being in such a small guild finding another tank would be more difficult.<br />
<br />
however i am going to try oomkin for levelling in wrath at some point althoggh i fancy trying to do some early instance running as mentioned above for xp and rep with new factions.<br />
<br />
so the dual spel will be great when it comes and i'll be wanting a oomkin dual spec along with my tanking one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bearing in mind my gear is only about 700 spell damage ?<br />
<br />
or will i be better of staying feral?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-07-2008, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll have ~850 damage as oomkin if you spec it cause of the talents that make a %of your int into spellpower.<br />
 <br />
That said, I'm sure the same old thing will apply - ferals will have less downtime. Even though boomkin mana regen is really strong, you'll probably run oom / have to sit and drink more than a feral will.<br />
 <br />
And pure dps is and always has been a dime a dozen, leveling (cat) feral and still being able to tank instances just fine will be really useful.<br />
 <br />
I'm only at 850ish spell damage on my moonkin, and I'm blowing things up. Not gonna lie, it's pretty fun both for questing, pvp and instancing. But a) I dont think that I could stand looking at that big furry owl for 10 more levels, and b) I'll always be feral at heart :P<br />
 <br />
edit:  the good news is that respecs are cheap, and gold is plentiful.  Try it all :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Clari...the links worked.  Looks good.  I wish I could avoid healing altogether from 70 - 80 because all out Moonkin is just a riot. :wink: <br />
<br />
As for my Priest, OMG I love all things Shadow!  Here she is:  <br />
<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Misha&amp;n=Mystralia <br />
<br />
She's still in a couple of blues, but for a relatively new 70, I think she's doing just fine.  I've yet to enchant anything because I think her gear will be replaced rather quickly in WoLTK.  <br />
<br />
However, I did just finish my FSW Robe today, and will be getting that and the shoulders enchanted this weekend.   <br />

My mana regen is off the charts when I go solo farming (plus 7k crits on starfire is quite impressive). Even so, if you were not a boomkin raider its safe to assume your T5 - T6 is feral or healing and thus you should level feral as no downtimje is a huge boon to leveling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i have zero patience for levelling alts. i have 1 70......yes you dont need glasses, i said i have 1 level 70 character after 4 yrs of playing !<br />
<br />
my only alt of note is a 58 mage who i really should finally take to outlands but time does not permit me to do stuff on 2 characters so i still do heroics etc on my druid and the mage sits in the AH in Og :p<br />
<br />
i will try oomkin but i was only anticipating it for 1/2 levels to see how viable it was. i will admit to having a sneaking wish to do some stuff - heroics at 80 as a dps caster as i think i would prefer that to doing dps in kitty.<br />
<br />
however i'm still feral at heart and prefer to tank than kitty - although kitty is amazing for levelling with bear for backup ofc :)<br />
<br />
Edit : just realised i was replying to the last posts on page 1 of this thread /ooops<br />
<br />
Mag - i enjoyed my little dabble with a friends SP from about lvl 60 to 63. it was fun.<br />
<br />
Kromas - yeah i will only try oomkin for a while cos i reckon i will not like the downtime compared to feral and ofc my oomkin gear is no where near as good as my feral stuff.<br />
<br />
Given i dont raid I think you can understand that my oomkin gear is a real mixture.<br />
<br />
ie i got some cloth epics made a month or 2 ago...Spellfire ? Hood and Pants ? plus some leather healing gear - like the epic crafted Shoulderpads of Renewed Life. And prob still a blue or 2 i kept hoarded away in the bank from levelling. I think i use the Gavel thats a rep reward for weapon and i have the offhand from being exalted with Cen Expedition.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to be able to find some good early drops that whilst green will improve my oomkin gear in some slots ?<br />
<br />
if/when they ever introduce dual specs i plan to have an oomkin spec cos i will not ever go back to being a healer like i had to in the old 40 raids in BWL etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've love to have 2 or 3 70's as i would really love to be able to experience playing other chars in at least 5 mans/ heroics but i'll never even get my mage to 70 let alone 80.<br />
<br />
what with having to level my druid to 80 and then kit him out and up his new faction rep. <br />
<br />
then i'll want to try a DK - god alone knows how long it will take me to level him. i dont even plan to start trying one for a while as i have to use my limited time for levelling to 80.<br />
<br />
hey ho, hence i'm always so keen to see what they are doing to 'my' druid and sometimes i get a bit annoyed at Blizz cos of the changes or proposed changes (like another nerf to armour incoming sometime and the supposed change to the multiplier to take account of it.....) cos I cant simply go and start doing something on another lvl 70 !</div></div><hr />

If you give me three hours I'll get 1-2 levels.  I've got mapped out routes I take in various zones in my head.  I know what quests in what order so that I don't waste time.  Its the only way I have that many characters with a decent level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">11-12-2008, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sounds more like a job than a game All !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, I'd say on good weeks I get to log about 20-25 hours.  Once you have powerleveled or efficiency leveled or whatever you want to call it once, you find you can crank out several levels at a time. Without really thinking about it.  <br />
<br />
Its funny to think how long it took me to get my first toon to 70 (probably 15 months or so) Now, I play less and can level to 70 in 6-8 weeks if I am focused on that toon.  <br />
<br />
Also, note that none of characters PvP actively.  I try to do the daily on my druid when I have time to kill, but for example my priest is 67 has &quot;3&quot; honor kills.  PvP can be fun, but huge time sink!  <br />
<br />
Also a big part of leveling fast is having a regular partner!  For example: I almost always start a new alt, when someone else in guild does.  So we do lots of leveling together and if your classes compliment each other, you can really plow through content and experience.</div></div><hr />

I list them like that because I run two machines at once and play two accounts at the same time. Leveling is easy that way. Farming anything, gold, dailies, leather, etc... is a snap.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this build for 80 as Dreamstate?<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0qGfu0sshzhMZZbE0ucuxbu<br />
<br />
I chose to avoid most of the crit based talents in favor of increasing base damage for the Balance tree unless it tied into healing spells too:<br />
<br />
Genesis, Nature's Majesty, Nature's Grace, Nature's Splendor, Lunar Guidance and Dreamstate are dual function talents.<br />
Starlight Wrath, Insect Swarm, Celestial Focus, Moonkin and Wrath of Cenarius to give a bit more umph to my DPS<br />
Brambles cause I like to root &amp; shoot when I solo and the damage shield is nice.<br />
<br />
In the Resto tree I chose talents that boosted my healing and mana regen:<br />
Naturalist, Intensity, Omen of Clarity, Improved Rejuv, Gift of Nature, Empowered Touch and Swiftmend<br />
<br />
I only tood Omen of Clairty and Tranquil Spirit because I had to spend some points to get down the Swiftmend, I wouldn't take them otherwise but didn't like the alternatives any better.</div></div><hr />

yes that would make a big difference and i would be levelling an alt alone which to me is soul destroying.<br />
<br />
i guess i get for about 12 hrs a week really.  my time can be a bit play/afk/play so only suitable for some dailies or some pvp.<br />
<br />
gotta be a bit more organised to commit to a 5 man.<br />
<br />
well Wow released in the January iirc in 04 and my druid was 60 in about June/July.  however in those days we had a few more in the guild and it was quite active.<br />
<br />
a fellow druid and I dual levelled together for the majority of 1-40 and as much as we could after this.  <br />
<br />
he may even come back to the game. he left a yr or so ago. popped back 2/3 months ago for a month to take a look, left again.  however yesterday he said his copy of Wrath has arrived and was installing !<br />
<br />
so i'm trying to persuade him to come back.</div></div><hr />

Druid Ferel<br />

Death Knight Frost (more tanking)<br />
Rogue, least up time (probably due to my lack of skilz lol)<br />

 <br />
TONS of fun IMO.  Try speccing into Unholy for leveling - AoE grinding is a joke.  I was running around HFP last night on all those 'kill 362908 boars or birds' quests, and was pulling 4-5 of them at a time and leaving the fight with literally 100% health.  <br />
 <br />
I'm kind of planning on having mine as a 'gatherer' too, though based on how fun / new the mechanics are, I wouldn't mind doin some pvp / pve on it.  the 'Crusader Aura' (on a pale horse) is amazing for herbing / mining.  So fast.  <br />
 <br />
When I get around to leveling my Druid, I'm thinking that I'll probably go with a Dreamstate build, as healers have been kinda hard to come by in the little time that I've spent in Northrend so far.</div></div><hr />

i am seriously in need of a Wrath skinner for my druids LW (dropped skinning a couple yrs ago or so to make a smoking heart of the mountain for tanking) cos borean leather is totally stoopid money :( so i am not even going to think about levelling it for now.<br />
<br />
my mage is a skinner but the time i would need to get him from 58 to 70 for coming to BT for borean leather is too much given i need 80 on my druid.....<br />

 <br />
And I've been able to solo every single elite quest so far (well, except for one that I did when I got into HFP at 58)<br />
 <br />
And DK &gt; mage for gatherer.  No Downtime, and it has a +20% increased mount speed and +15% run speed at all times ^^<br />
