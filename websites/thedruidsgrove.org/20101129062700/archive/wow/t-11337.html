<br />
I personally think I might get some bracers and work for the warlrods chest but I'll see how easy it is after the weekend. Except for the fact that the BGs seem to be broken and constant disconnects, I'm quite happy with this patch (except I thought we were getting Pounce to work w/o having to be behind the target...)<br />

The honor system is pretty nice you can crank out a few thousand honor in a couple hours if you have a nice group, I'm still skeptical about whether it's being calculated accuractly, but meh...</div></div><hr />

You would be better off going for the Marshal's/General's Dragonhide Leggings than the WSG pants. Much better overall pants, although the WSG lizard are slightly better for tanking. As for only getting two pieces, that prevents you from getting the three piece speed bonus which is the best part of the epic pvp set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I PvP'd yesterday and got about 12k honor which is half of what a Warlord piece costs. That means I could easily get the full set in 1 week, when it took me close to 3 months of earning the gear in the old system.<br />
<br />
Great change imho, better off left to be implemented in BC however. No one that acheived rank 13/14 in the old system will think its fair that they changed it before the expansion. Garunteed, you will see 75% of the people running around in Warlord gear and HWL weapons. <br />
<br />
At least this will make sure everyone is geared up for BC.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
 I do however think that it was a very good move for Blizzard and the player population in general. For Blizzard this has got more people playing the BG's than ever before. People seem to be very happy with the new talents for the most part and very happy with the honor changes, thus keeping them playing and playing, and paying and paying. It also takes the foucus off of the BC expansion just a bit.<br />
<br />
 For the player population the new system opens up alot of different possibilities. The casual and very casual player can now see that they can obtain nice gear without having to do 40 man raids or grinding rep 8-12 per day. Once geared it will put them on a more level playing field where they can compete in pvp without having to worry about gear being such a determining factor. People see that they can do this with each character that they have at thier own pace so they keep playing, and keep paying.<br />
<br />
 Player wins, Blizzard wins.</div></div><hr />

The thing that is bugging me is that my priest, who only does shadow damage, with the occasional heal (5/0/46 ^^) has about twice as much honor as my Druid.<br />
<br />
I am wondering if blizz is still giving more honor for killing blows, or why exactly my priest is out-pacing my druid for honor.  I constantly get tons of HK's on my druid healing, but maybe 1 KB if i'm lucky.  Anyone know if healers are getting shafted honor-wise in the BG's?</div></div><hr />

You'll get better PvP gear in a month lorath. I understand it sucks that people have fight long for their PvP-gear and now people can pick it like candy.<br />
<br />
But your PvP-skills still is there! Noone can take that away from you. :) I myself (who hates raiding and loves PvP) will ofc welcome better PvP players.<br />
<br />
Better PvP-players means I get to kill/own GOOD playahs (and get better at winning). :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bad part is so much of it takes AV tokens which unless we have a good 15 from my guild working together, horde never wins in my BG. (Well I guess that's not true, I'll say unless you have a large premade force working together horde never wins) For some reason alliance rushes straight to the boss, and wins; horde tries to cap every stupid thing out there, then wonder why alliance has won while they are still on Belinda. I can't figure out why Horde in general is so stupid when it comes to AV. <br />
<br />
I'd like to eventually get my shaman DWing the maces or axes from HWL but that's a long way off, he's an alt and I don't care much about his gear. I just think it'd look cool. Axes he's specialized in, but those maces just look so sweet. <br />

My druid probably won't ever see BG armour/weapons unless I get really bored.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">12-10-2006, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know I said the same thing in guild chat last night, &quot;I feel bad for all the guys that made HWL before the patch.  I kinda trivializes it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
But then I'd have to agree with the reply.  A member said that he can't feel sorry.  Before the change to the honor system, only 52 in an entire year could get HWL/GM.<br />
<br />
52 out of how many a server?  <br />
<br />
lorath, it can be done.  An old pvp guild on my server went raid turned raid guild after getting bored with pvp and all the gear.  They put a similar effort into the raids and had MC cleared in a week and a half.  So I guess that would be 2 tries through.  I'm not sure how far they into BWL atm.<br />
<br />
Besides the other thing is, it has to be done before the Xpac or everyone will really be getting creamed by the raiders.  The HWL/GM stuff is nice yes.  But its getting so outdated its crazy.  The gap between the pvp gear and the new raid crap that the naxx guys are throwing is about as bad as fighting T1/2 players while running around in blues and greens.  Its just going to get worse too.  Heck one AB team I fought last night had 4 warriors with Thunderfury.<br />
<br />
Besides I'm glad that maybe now the honor farmers will relax too.  AV used to be my favorite bg.  There was so much stuff to do on that map.  But now all anyone does is zerg the boss and its over faster than WSG.  Totally destroyed the fun.<br />
<br />
With all the new interest in pvp, this is one of the best patches thus far.  The new talents make it just that much better.  BTW I am loving my Unstable Affliction.  Last night a pally decided to cleanse (I already burned him through his good bubble).  Yeah he killed himself off my UA.  That AB loss was all worth it to see that.:elfbiggri</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is suppose to have it because it was designed to be obtained by the PvPers that were willing to put in the work to get it. PvE gear takes just as long as it would to get PvP gear because even if you down a boss, your item may not drop and you may not have the DKP for it. <br />
<br />
No one QQs about not getting their PvE gear, so why should it be any different for PvP gear. Im glad the arena will be the only place that epic level 70 PvP gear will be obtained because every newb and their brother wont have access to it. <br />
<br />
Now that everyone has Warlord gear, we might as well all be wearing greens...at least the fight wouldnt be over in 3 seconds from the ridiculus damage most classes can do.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I compeletely agree with the change. I just wish Blizzard either:<br />

A) Waiting until the Burning Crusade to implement it so as not to put trash all the hard work that REAL Rank13/14s put in to get the gear.<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
B) Made the price of the items a little more realistic. A HWL weapon should not take 2 days to obtain when it honestly took 4 months in the old system. Its pathetic. Up the gear costs by 2 or 3 times and make the HWL weapons cost at least 2 weeks of PvPing to obtain.<br />

Maybe true. =)<br />

But acctually I think Blizz is trying to even people out as BC launches.. Let's face it.. your rank14 weapon will be replaced fairly soon anyway. Why whine about it? Just let people get it. =)</div></div><hr />

I just want free epics because they are all going to get replaced in 2months after working our asses off to get them now. I wonder how many new customers or returning customers they lured in with this change and how many were considering playing as much as possible because the HWL items were reasonably obtainable now? I wonder how many of those people are still going to grind out the required honor in order to get said items now. <br />
<br />
I would have to say it is a bit short-sighted to up the cost on level 60 epics that will be replaced halfway to 70 by a green item, given the potential boost this could have given to the player base. Oh noes people are getting purples in 2-3 days...time to revamp!! GG on the bait and switch, I am sure quite a few people are having trouble sitting down after this bone job.</div></div><hr />

It takes one good day of PvP to get a current piece of the Warlord set. There is no other epic, in this entire game, that is as easily obtainable as Warlord Gear and High Warlord weapons. <br />
<br />
Quit crying, you got great gear basically given to you. Enjoy it instead of claiming your getting boned by Blizzard. If anyone, its us old system Rank13/14s that got it the worst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 06:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See this is where I think a lot of people have grossly misinterpreted this game.  lorath I think you are wanting something that you are not going to find in this game at this point.<br />
<br />
I remember when WoW first came out.  I remember all the adds leading up to its release.  I remember the design team interviews.  Most specifically I remember the claim, that WoW is going to be a game that took the best aspects of the good, and do away with the bad aspects which held the existing games back.  It was going to be a game that is challenging yet can be enjoyed by the casual community.  The reason they targeted the casual, because they anticipated the WoW player base to be an older, more mature, but yet more restricted base.  The major crowd at the time was the long standing blizz fans, the ones that played all the Warcraft games, the Diablo games.  These people are now older, have jobs, families.<br />
<br />
Anyways that was the frame.  That's why its so easy to solo to 60.  That's why all the early group content only required a handful of players.  <br />
<br />
Later the game took a turn to a more hardcore base.  But that, was not the original intent.  Blizz recognized the player feedback and although drawn out, changes have been implemented to take the game back to the original purpose.  I'm sorry that the original purpose, was not to cater the hardcore community (be it raiding or pvp).  <br />
<br />
Truth be told the only people that will have 1 week epics are the ones grossly overplaying the pvp with the new changes.  The whole intent was to make it so that you didn't have to play so much to get there, but still be done over time (hence the removal of honor decay).  Its just that its the new thing so everyone is excited.<br />
<br />
Oh and as for the fairness between pvp and pve.  Have you forgotten already the TBC material yet to be implemented.  If you have I'll remind you.  <br />
1) new raid scaling matching player level with difficulty<br />
2) new raid content manning requirements greatly reduced, no new 40 man content, its all 20 and below<br />
3) going with #2, epic level 5 man if I remember right<br />
4) and lets not forget how easy the current 40 man content will become if the up and coming raiding guilds are currently working on acquiring the HWL gear prior to these changes.  There is going to be a big difference in the difficulty on MC if you got HWL gear as opposed to the blues we all used to have to start with.<br />
<br />
So, PVE is going to become significantly more accessible as well.  Again I'm sorry that to you and all the others that put in the time for the 13/14 before.  But really you brought these changes on by playing the game in a way that was not the original intent.  Blizz is just rebalancing their product.  If that is not what you want in the game, I would maybe suggest you find something more suited to your play.  <br />
<br />
Korean games are very hardcore, and focus heavily on PVP.  Rising Force online isn't bad if that's your niche.  I suggest Belato, nothing like seeing everyone flee in terror as you role out you Black MAU.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind the honor reduction.  To be honest, I was expecting it to take from the 2.0 patch until BC time to get the three pieces of epic PVP armor that I've chosen to pursue.  I was surprised to see how fast I got my first item and really was thinking it was a bit too easy.<br />
<br />
The lack of honor decay is something I wish they'd done from the start.  I have close to 30 days played on Forest, and I'd say 20 of them are PvP.  I got to rank 10.  For me and what I've got going on in my life, that's a lot and it deserves more than a couple of blues IMHO.  So, for me, the fact that I can now pick up a few epic PvP items is justice.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, no matter what Blizz does, there is always going to be a small group of people who are privledged enough to be able to grab their mega-pack of Moutain Dew, sit down and play for several days straight to get what they want.  Even if Blizz cut the honor gain by 70%, you'd still see ppl getting the epic PvP stuff in a damned short amount of time.  I'm thinking we'll be seeing level 70s insanely quickly when BC comes out...that's the way it goes.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think the new honor system is the best thing to happen to WoW pvp since the initiation of the bg's.  That's with or without the 30% reduction.  Would it have been cool to have it the way it was at patch, yeah.  But even still this is 1 million times better than the old system.  Especially the removal of decay.  That was the major problem I had.  I would make some rank, but it seemed like every time I made so headway, here I am packing my bags and getting deployed for 3-6 months.  I would always lose my rank.  After a couple times of that I just said screw it.  Between working sometimes up to 85-90 hours a week, college, working out, my girl and the constant TDY and deployments; there was no way in hell that I'd have made it past rank 6 or 7.  So this is very nice for me.<br />
<br />
On another note, there is a cool thing about having lost all my rank prior to the patch.  You see, when I kill knights, generals and marshalls I get lots of honor.  But when they kill little scout me...NO SOUP FOR YOU! :devil-lau</div></div><hr />

Totally - and I didn't think it was directed at anyone in particular.  I made the comment because sometimes WoW players makes me think of the movie &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; with the nerdy kid (who now plays the Mac on the Mac and PC commercials, btw) and his friends who think the TV show is real.<br />

People do tend to forget it is just a computer game and its supposed to be fun.</div></div><hr />
