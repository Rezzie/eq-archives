<br />
I was wondering if Totem of Infliction (http://thotbott.com/?i=3309)  combined with a dagger or 1 handed mace is worth more than a two handed stave or mace with better stats. Does the effect of Totem work in cat / bear form? Would you give up stats on a two hander because the 1% chance on totem as a feral druid? Thanks =)<br />

I use it mostly for the armor - if you use the TOI with a dagger marked &quot;of the bear&quot; (or similar), it's not a bad combo.  Normally I generally go for a 2h'er just for the stats, and because I'm lazy  :P</div></div><hr />

My current feral 1h kind of stinks, 5 str and 1 stamina, but my 2h is only marginally better at 11 str and 4 agi (when factoring in the 50 armor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">05-27-2005, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for Unyielding Maul. Wich is a pretty &quot;common&quot; drop in Dire Maul. Your Dire Bear form just _shines_ with 250 extra armor.<br />
<br />
But before you get there.. Ardent Custodian (epic drop.. to bad.. but it sells fot like 20-60g, depending on server) is a really good weapon for bear form, combined with totem of infliction.<br />
<br />
But everyone wants the warden staff. :D</div></div><hr />

For instance, Green Whelp Armor (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=12103) is pretty awesome for bearform if you're tanking multiples (i.e. instance) a lot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tygre</div><div class="date">05-30-2005, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am currently wielding a +5str mace (I believe it's a Sequoia Hammer of Strength) and the Totem.  The proc on the totem goes off once on every 2 out of 3 mobs I would say, so nothing really realiable for the added dps.  Of course, I am wielding it mainly for the 50AC.  In Bear form thats 140AC and in Dire Bear form thats 230AC.  At my current lvl of 34 (and complete lack of non-mount funds at this time) I feel it's not a bad combo.  <br />
<br />
So I did some research on Alla's and found that up until lvl 38 the most str you can get on a 2h is +20 and up to +7 sta.  Would something like that be considered better to wield while in bear form than a +5 1h mace for example and the ToI with 50AC?  How about at 38 if you are lucky enough to get a Ardent Custodian with it's 100AC and +7 def?  The Warden Staff with 260AC, +15 def, and +11 sta does look good if you can get it as early as 43 and it appears to be better (marginally) than the Unwielding Maul which you have to be 57 to equip.  Would a +str enchant help offset the loss of not using a high strength 2hr?  Thoughts?  Please advise.<br />
<br />
note:  I have a feeling this will turn into a discussion of:  &quot;If you have more str you kill the mobs faster but have less ac so will get hit a bit harder&quot; and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use &quot;The Rockpounder&quot; when im in cat form.  It gives me +2% chance to crit which is definitely notticable.  So yes.</div></div><hr />

It's a 2h Mace with +20 Str, somewhere around +14 Stamina, and +5 Resistance.  For me the +20 Str caught my eye along with a decent Stamina increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tygre</div><div class="date">06-01-2005, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have been thinking about this for a bit and I believe I found my answer.  Have both sets on hand if you can.  A +20str/+sta 2h staff when soloing where str will help kill mobs faster and more hp is better than ac especially regarding casters.  Then flip to ardent/ToI combo (or better) if you are the main tank in an instance where ac and sta are best used since the object is to maintain agro and survive the hits better while your groupmates supply the dps.<br />

Sound good?</div></div><hr />
