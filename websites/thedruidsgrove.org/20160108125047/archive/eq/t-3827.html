Apparently there is some deeper meaning to this, and you good folks would be able to tell me what it was. Can someone explain?<br />

<br />
The gist has to do with druids foraging up their first cabbage, their lucky cabbage and keeping. Perhaps thinking it would bring them luck and enhancments.<br />
<br />
Hold tight for a more historically acurate answer, and be sure not to forage up any bitter slaw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, that delicious cabbage you sometimes forage in the Karanas? A long time ago, a rumour started on this board that no druid should leave their home without one if they wanted the good favours from their god. I still have mine deep inside one backpack. After all those years, I think the smell only keeps the bad guys away... :) <br />
<br />
The rest is history...</div></div><hr />

Historically druids started to keep one single cabbage in their inventory as a &quot;lucky&quot; cabbage...basically if you think it of a lucky charm. Over the years it just became a normal thing and people knew what the cabbage ment. <br />
<br />
So we needed a single target of protection of the gades. So VI set up a quested way to get this spell and with I think some pushing from TDG called it Protection of the Cabbage after the lucky cabbage some druids keep in their inventory.<br />
<br />
Im sure other people can expand but thats basicaly how it came :) <br />

When they add those lucky charm slots......they better add a lucky cabbage one which looks like the normal cabbage you can forage AND i expect it to be good stat :P<br />

<br />
The Original NPC in Fungus Grove is named Rebbecca Cabbageleaf and although she was in the game long before PotC came about I believe she was named in honor of our own Lotusfly.  I also believe that it was Lotusfly that originally began the Lucky Cabbage prophecy.<br />
<br />
The fact that the quest designers made this lasting in game memorial to this community is unlike anything that has been done before.</div></div><hr />

Also in the books describing the initial quest that led to the spell had mention of many long time druids grove posters in it by name.  The final reward (earring, not spell) was also named after the first druid to complete the quest on all servers.</div></div><hr />

I believe the first person to use the cabbage in an image sig was Windd.<br />
<br />
Sorrun's was in his text sig.<br />

Also note that 'Protection of the Nine' is a reference to the nine gift bearers of the Cabbage quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many seasons ago Lotusfly foraged her lucky cabbage and rather than eat or destroy it, she tucked it into her backpack and began to notice a difference in her fortunes.<br />
<br />
After some thought, she realized that since her cabbage find, her death's were happening less often.  The news of the cabbage's protection was something that she chose to share with her fellow druids.<br />
<br />
Not long after, other stories of good fortune following the preservation of the lucky cabbages, by various druids, proved that the talisman worked for many of us!<br />
<br />
It became a part of our lore and a custom to keep your lucky cabbage always, for the protection and good fortune it provides.  And to also forage and share them with close friends.<br />
<br />
I hope that your lucky cabbage will bring you much good fortune :) <br />
<br />
Hugs to Lotusfly for sharing.  My cabbage is sweet and fresh after all this time and there is nothing that would cause me to part with it.</div></div><hr />

People got Mammoth cloaks, Verm Tunics, their Paw drops and the mobs they needed would spawn.   The power of the Cabage was mocked but once people tested it they became believers in the Power of the lucky veggie.  <br />
