What are the differences between the warlocks and the mages.  they seem fairly similar to me.  Do they both perform equally in DPS??? what about crowd control??? or AOE??? i know mage's are serious damage dealers...... why would one roll a warlock???  any tips or insight on this matter would be greatly appreciated.<br />

Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlocks I heard are hard to master so that's why they're a minority. Mages are fun from my first 10 levels of a mage. Prepare to get used to your squishyness though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">05-22-2006, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a huge fan of warlocks.  Though I have only gotten mine to 29 (then stalled, as friends rerolled on another server), from what I have learned about them I consider them the second most fun class in WoW.  Aside from druids of course.<br />
<br />
That being said, the main thing about warlocks is that they can control pets, similar to a hunter.  Each pet can buff the warlock differently, depending on spec, and can be summoned for different purposes (unlike a hunter).  I.e.  you have your voidwalker (big blue thing) for tanking - he has a taunt ability, your imp for grouping - he has ranged dps and a stamina buff, succubus for crowd control vs. humanoids and dps - seduce cc's a humanoid for 10 or 15 sec, and felhunter for fighting casters - it can eat buffs and debuffs, and gives the lock 60 resistance to every school of magic.<br />
<br />
On top of that, warlocks can do insane dps with either shadow or fire spells.  They have a couple different AoE spells, and tons of different debuff curses.  As Trixtaa mentioned, they are hard to master, but I found it pretty easy, and fun coming from playing a druid (also a difficult class to master).  Mages look like a lot of fun, though if you are used to playing a toon which can play lots of different roles, you may find a mage to be one dimensional.  Though I have never played one, and just speculating.  <br />
<br />
When it comes down to it, try both, and see which one feels better.  All we have is time, right?</div></div><hr />

Although they use spells they work in a differnt way to mages. Mages dump lots of mana into big dps, lots of instant damage. Locks mostly use DOTS. A mage and a lock can both do the same damage but the lock will just take a bit longer to bring the mob down. <br />
The correct use of demons is vital to be a good lock. Get Voidy out to tank and then DOTS on the mobs. A bit of AOE and then drainlife and your done. Succy can be great on humanoids with suduce and if you get drain-tanking right you will not get much downtime. The pocket sized Imp is just a DPS add and gives a nice Stam buff.<br />
Felhunter handles cloth wearers, simple as.<br />
The high level demons are rarely used as they will turn on the casting lock after a period of time and need to be re-tamed. Too much hassle most of the time so I hear.<br />
Locks have good crowd contol with fear, just be careful if there are lots of other mobs about otherwise you'll get swamped.<br />
All in all locks are fun and are hated in PvP due to Suduce, Fear and the DOTS.<br />
Have fun if you roll one :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">05-23-2006, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a raid or group setting, both Mages and Warlocks can do very good single target damage.  Warlocks don't have the instant damage spells that mages do, but if the fight lasts long enough for some of their DoTs to contribute, they are right up there on the damage charts with them.  The downside of warlocks in a raid is they lack the ability to drop agro.  In long fights where tanks die, the mob can often turn first upon the Warlock.<br />
<br />
Mages can solo faster, in general, than warlocks.  However, if fear kiting is an option, Warlocks can take down even level elites without breaking a sweat, and normal mobs several levels higher.  Mages can have quite a bit of difficulty with Elites, due to their high hp.  Warlocks, similar to druids, do not kill things especially quickly, but can do so with very little downtime.  Mages, will stop and drink to replenish mana every couple-three mobs.<br />
<br />
In PvP, a warlock with the optimal pet out is nearly unbeatable.  About the only class that can currently beat one, imho, is a shadow priest.  In small group PvP, the combination of DoTs, Fear, and Death Coil are extremely effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaran</div><div class="date">05-30-2006, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mages are all about the big boom. Hi damage counts, powerful aoe, powerful nukes, and buffs to supplement that (extra mana, intellect, etc..). Add in the ever popular teleport and summon food and drink.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are a bit more general utility. They can approach a mage in dps if they focus in that direction, but in more limited ways. They are a pet class, more utility backed up by said pet. Several summoned utility items, summon player (reverse teleport), and very fast mana regen by sacrificing hit points, and of course, a cool free horse. They are in my opinion a bit more slow and steady. More durable than the mage, but take a bit longer to kill things (less down time though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">05-30-2006, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warlocks are great, I love mine.<br />
<br />
In PVP its basically mage &gt; melee, warlock &gt; casters.  Granted a mage can burn down a caster and my warlock can typically handle any melee (I love blowing up epic warriors with their big fancy swords).  But mages obliterate melee classes especially if they can tie them all up into an AOE fest.  Warlocks though can shut down casters to the point there isn't really much a caster can do to retalliate against a well played warlock.<br />
<br />
In PVE warlocks are a lot of fun.  Part of it is just that its typically a busy class until you start raiding.  The other part is the fact that there are so many different talent set-ups and each tree has a very different playstyle.  Affliction is your shadow dmg tree though its has some nice utilities like improved life tap and fel concetration.  Demonology is obviously your demon tree; every thing there is focused on making your pets stronger and a lot of utility in this tree as well.  Most of which comes from the last 10 points or so.  Mainly Demonic Sacrifice and Master Demonologist.  DS gives different buffs depending on the pet you sac.  Master demo has its own buffs which you get for having a pet out.  MD is also the ONLY way short of 8/8 nemesis to reduce your threat from your nukes.  Destruction tree is the fast damage tree.  It plays a lot like a mage would play.  Most of the damage comes off building crit chance/dmg and making casting faster.  This comes from bane talent and 2 instant cast spells you can gain if you go heavy destruction.  Though this tree lacks survivability, however it has the highest possible up front damage output of all tree.<br />
<br />
Warlocks can do great damage, though unless they are destro specced its mostly back loaded.  So the longer the fight drags on, the more damage they will be able to do.  Warlocks are mostly about self sustained long term dps.  Where as mages are great front loaded dps due to all the instants however they can't keep up as long as a warlock.<br />
<br />
As for pets, warlock pets aren't that strong really.  They are just there for utility.  In raids you are for the most part stuck with imp since its has the HP buff and its really the only pet that will survive in a heavy damage fight like raid bosses since it can phase shift and won't take damage as long as you don't make it attack.  In 5-10 mans warlocks can fill the CC role.  Its more difficult to perform than a mage, but its possible to hold up 2-3 mobs if you are good.  2 is very possible with succy do to seduce.  You can &quot;fear-pong&quot; mobs with fear and toggling curses to keep it from running into adds.  Its difficult to fill the CC role but with concentration it can be done effectively, just a mage can sheep and forget for 30 seconds where as a warlock has to constantly monitor the mob.  Though warlocks will always find invites for Soul Stone, so it works out.<br />
<br />
All that said warlocks aren't that different than mages in the end.  You get some curses and dots but mostly you just nuke.   In raids you won't be using many dots since there is a 16 debuff limit which fills up very fast with 40 people.  Its basically just Curse of shadow/elements and maybe your choice between corruption (shadow) or immolate (fire).  For the most part you are just sitting in back nuking with the mages.<br />
<br />
There are a couple perks to locks though.  One of the really cool ones is having either fel concentration or master demo you can be a great mage tank.  If you got MD pull out the felpuppy for the +60 resist and pull agro.  Warlocks can get a decent HP pull so its not unreasonable.  Searing Pain is great for pulling/holding agro since it is a heavy agro spell.  This works even better against mobs that cast shadow since locks have shadow ward (think PW:S only for shw dmg).  I tank those warlocks in UD strat a lot and sometimes Gandling if the warrior gets ported.  There is even a fight in AQ40 where this is needed against one of the twin emps.<br />
<br />
So yeah warlocks are pretty cool.  Though mages are a lot of fun too.  And in raids a bit easier to play since they have more nuke choices.  Warlocks are going to be screwed if when it comes to heavy shadow resist/ invuln raids since we have no real fire nukes.  Searing Pain pulls too much hate and Conflag is on a long cooldown.  There is Soul Fire but that takes 6 sec to cast and uses a shard so...we have to spam immolate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 got this off of http://www.playnow.com.au/cgi-bin/ul...;f=13;t=001133<br />
<br />
but it appears to have made it's rounds.. enjoy =)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Preparation <br />
You can find an SL warlock outside IF or Orgrimmar, this is the place were most SL warlocks hang out. <br />
To initiate combat, you should approach the warlock and talk to him. He will say something about how nerfed warlock were, and how they could not kill anyone in previous patches, and how they became godlike while mages are now water dispensers. After you talk to him, click DUEL to start the fight. <br />
<br />
<br />
PHASE ONE <br />
<br />
You should position yourself as shown in this image: <br />
<br />
http://img133.imageshack.us/my.php?image=warlockmod8jo.jpg <br />
<br />
The warlock will begin the fight without a pet, because he will feel too overpowered to use a pet against you. MT#1 and MT#2 should position the warlock so that his back will face the tank farther away from the IF door. It is advisable for them to have at least 350 shadow resistance, and one of them should also have 250 fire resist minimum. (This is explained later). Greater Shadow Protection pots are also a good commodity, as Whipper root tubers and +50 stamina potions from the quest in Blasted Lands. <br />
<br />
The melee DPS group (shown as YELLOW in the pic) should stay behind the warlock, near the tank farther away from the Gate. This is done because they will need to retreat behind the tank and bandage, from time to time. (Bandage spot is shown on the pic) <br />
<br />
The rest of the raid should position as shown in the picture. It is important for the raid to have about 120-200 shadow resistance, which will help sustain the damage. Keep in mind you will need at least 2 dispellers for each debuff type, otherwise you will wipe pretty soon. <br />
<br />
During Phase 1, the warlock will perform a series of attacks: <br />
<br />
SHADOW BOLT: A bolt of shadow is launched every 4 seconds to the tank that has aggro, causing 1200 to 2500 shadow damage, depending on resistance. A shadow bolt will crit between 3500 and 6500 damage, again depending on the target resistance. This is were MT#2 should come into play: If a Shadowbolt crits MT#1, he will have a debuff that will increase Shadow damage by a Zillion times. This is when MT#2 should taunt the warlock to prevent MT#1 from dying. MT#1 will then do the same thing once another Shadowbolts crits MT#2. <br />
<br />
<br />
Curse of Doom: Every 1 minute, the warlock will cast CoD on a random raid member. This member should move outside the raid and unload full DPS, since he will die within the minute. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowburn: The warlock will cast Shadowburn everytime he changes target. If one of the raid members gets aggro, he will suffer shadowburn and instantly die. It is important not to OverDPS, or members will die one after another. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fear: The warlock will cast Fear on a randomy raid member, every few seconds. You should provide everyone with Fear Ward if you have it, and dispel fear ASAP, especcially on MTs and Healers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 1 is relatively easy and will last until the warlock has 70% life. This can take between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on your equipment. <br />
<br />
<br />
PHASE TWO <br />
<br />
When the warlock reaches 70% life, he will instacast a felhunter and Soul Link it. This is when the fight becomes harder. <br />
Note: You cannot kill the warlock while the felhunter is alive. If you try to, the warlock will say that It's not his time yet and will use an healthstone, which will probably render the fight impossible in phase three. <br />
<br />
A few moments before Phase two, the raid should move as shown in the pic. <br />
<br />
http://img336.imageshack.us/my.php?image=warlock2mod5yb.jpg <br />
<br />
Note: MT#3 and MT#4, which are tanking the felhunter, should stay at least 10 yards away from the warlock <br />
<br />
Phase two is all about killing the felhunter. <br />
The felhunter CANNOT BE DAMAGED by magic, as it has very high magic resistance. Also, during phase two, you should not magic debuff the pet or the warlock, otherwise the felhunter will remove the debuff and heal himself. <br />
<br />
MT#1 &amp; #2 should stay on the warlock with a few healers, while the melee DPS group will take down the Felhunter, while the magic <br />
DPS group focuses on the warlock. During this phase, the warlock will receive next to no damage, as he is Soul Linked to the pet. <br />
<br />
During Phase two, the warlock will have a new attack at his disposal: <br />
<br />
Hellfire: Every 20 seconds, the warlock will cast Hellfire and hit anyone within 10 yards for an incredible amount of Fire damage. <br />
<br />
Every DPS class standing near the warlock should retreat as shown in the picture and bandage as soon as he casts hellfire. Only the MT with Fire resistance should remain near the warlock. This is done because if the warlock finds no one within melee range during Hellfire, he will summon an Infernal and wipe the raid. <br />
<br />
When the Felhunter is dead, PHASE THREE begins. <br />
<br />
<br />
PHASE THREE <br />
<br />
Phase three will begin as soon as the Felhunter is dead. <br />
Notes: The warlock should be at around 40% health now. If he's any higher than that, you'll prolly not be able to take him down before you wipe. Also, if you have more than 6-7 dead members by now, you will probably wipe as you can't do enough DPS. <br />
<br />
During phase three, the warlock will use all his arsenal to kill you. <br />
<br />
Curse of Shadow/Elements/Agony: Every 10 seconds, the warlock will cast a random Curse on the entire raid. These debuffs should be removed as soon as possible. If CoE or CoS are not removed after 10 seconds, the warlock will cast Immolate/Shadowbolt on the member, killing him. <br />
<br />
Howl of Terror: The Warlock will randomy cast HoT, hitting all the melees around him. You need to be quick and dispel Fear on the MTs otherwise they will lose aggro. <br />
<br />
Death coil: The most imbalanced spell in the warlock's arsenal. This spell will be cast on a random raid member killing him, and will heal the warlock. CT_raidassist will warn you when the warlock is about to cast Deathcoil, and all Healers should hide behind the tank. If more than 3-4 healers are killed, the MTs will not be able to sustain damage and die, wiping the raid. <br />
<br />
Note: In this pic ( http://img336.imageshack.us/my.php?i...ock2mod5yb.jpg ) an arrows point to the out-of-LOS spot for Healers. This is where you should hide when the warlock is about to deathcoil <br />
<br />
<br />
PHASE FOUR <br />
When the warlock is at 5% life, he does an emote saying &quot;Imba Warlock performs one last service for Blizzard&quot; He will then cast Curse of Doom on the entire raid. This means you need to kill him within one minute, or you will wipe. You should have at least 15-20 DPS classes still alive here, otherwise you won't be able to kill him in time. <br />
<br />
If you manage to kill him within the minute, congratulations! You just killed the hardest boss currently in World of Warcraft!<br />

<br />
soloing with a lock isn't fun... dungeons are and groups are great but as someone mentioned, you're primarily using your Imp, and that's okay.<br />
<br />
Soul Shards suck! even with the new bags.  they're a pain in the arse to manage and gather.<br />
<br />
Also, the lack of sheep is a serious disadvantage over mages.  Fear is okay, but the running factor makes it difficult to use in instances.<br />
<br />
On the plus side... their damage output is great, and the longer the battle, the more often the lock is saving everyone's butt.  <br />
<br />
Soul Stones rock!  even at every 30 minutes, SS your rezzer is invaluable... just dont be one of those dumbasses that SS's themselves instead of their rezzer. please, don't be that guy!<br />
<br />
Healthstones! A great addition to the dungeon experience.<br />
<br />
So, locks are great in groups but boring solo.<br />
<br />
Mages, on the otherhand... great nukers, great dps... but the epitome of squishy.  Sheep is great... conjure food and water is a huge money saver as you lvl (if g is an issue).<br />
<br />
mages are more fun to solo than locks but after playing a hunter, every class is boring to solo, save rogues.<br />
<br />
All in all... the mage is your better bet, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">06-05-2006, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think warlock was boring to solo at all.  It depends partly on how you spec, but an affliction or Demon Sac warlock has absolutely zero downtime.  The levels went by so fast.  <br />
<br />
A lot of people complain about soul shards.  But that too is very easily managed.  Just get a mod like shard tracker or necrosis (my fav) and you are set.  <br />
<br />
The sheep thing is true though, sheep is possibly the best CC in the game.  But there are some advantages with warlock.  Mainly that Fear if you have the room will last through a little damage.  Also in most of the places that you can't fear, you can seduce.  Which while lasting only a short time compared to sheep, can be used at anytime in the fight without the side effect of healing your target.<br />
<br />
There are trade offs to both classes.  However most are managed very easily with locks.  The real issue for locks now is that we only have 1 viable school for constant nuking, shadow.  Fire uses DOT's and long cooldown instant damages.  This is going to be a problem when they start making shadow res/immune raids.</div></div><hr />
