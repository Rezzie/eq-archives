Contained within it are two addons (amongst countless others) - Mapster (a map replacement) and Gathermate (has a database of known herb/mining locations and shows them on both the map and the mini map). They work well and make gathering a breeze. One other addon I use for gathering is called Routes - it allows you to create the best route for visiting all these herb or mining nodes and shows it both on the map and mini map (lines joining all the nodes). These three addons make gathering a breeze and can all be downloaded individually. This doesn't help with your current problem but is at least one possible solution.<br />

<br />
When I asked Blizz about this, I was told it was a permissions issue because I'm using Vista, and so none of my settings are allowed to be stored.  No solution was offered. /shrug  If you happen to find a solution, I hope you repost.<br />
<br />
I've given up on it for now, lol</div></div><hr />

tlb : what did you exactly do to exnable your gatherer mod and gatheremod db ?<br />
<br />
On Saturday my gatherer was working fine and all the herb spots i've visited are showing on the worldmap for each zone and yet the next day, Sunday, without me altering anything i have a totally blank world map ?<br />
<br />
And i'm having to start again....its adding herbs i get again now since sunday and they were still showing last night so it cant be a permission thing ?<br />
<br />
I just want to know whats happened to all the data i had previously for Azeroth / Outland and Northrend.<br />
<br />
I look quickly on the gatherer web site but nothing there recently to indicate any known issues. <br />
<br />
I have the most uptodate version so its not just changed to cause me to lose data etc<br />
<br />
/puzzled and confused and fed up</div></div><hr />

I don't keep quest helper, gatherer, auctioneer, etc. all enabled when I know I'm just gonna raid.  You can install addons and not enable them.  And the settings are per toon.  So, I have auctioneer enabled on my banking alt, but not my main.<br />
<br />
So, last night I enabled them and flew around ice crown.  Saw the nodes on the map.  And logged off.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

This may cause the addon to reset itself.  I've done that before with quest helper when it was all wonky (my British 'word of the day').</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-16-2009, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I work for a UK owned company.  Those of us in the states often get a good laugh from some of the words choices.  One of my favorites are &quot;wicked&quot; and &quot;tame&quot;.  They are used to describe project status.  If a project is &quot;wicked&quot; we are unsure of the goals and/or the time estimates.  If a project is &quot;tame&quot;, the project is well defined and the estimates are probably very close to what it will actually take to complete the work.<br />
<br />
In US-english, wicked is typically used to describe something that is evil.  And tame is equivalent to domesticated (best word I could think of...).  Neither of which would be used to described the &quot;status&quot; of a project.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-16-2009, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol tlb.<br />
<br />
indeed - over here young people actually use wicked to describe something that is 'cool' or 'awesome'.<br />
<br />
and i guess 'tame' would also be used for something that is a bit boring or unexciting.<br />
<br />
can't say i've ever used or heard used wicked or tame for within project management.</div></div><hr />

I'd be curious to know how you did it, as I'm struggling with the same thing and just gave up after a month or so struggling with trying to get Gatherer to store the information after logging out and just disabled it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tlb : dont know it - although someone on my FB is nuts about it and only everr talks about some woman in it and the show itself.<br />
<br />
i love musicals but i guess all the older ones and maybe not some of the new / more way out ones.<br />

glad u enjoyed london.</div></div><hr />
