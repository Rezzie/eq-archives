Have been raping Rathes Hill Giants and the entrence mobs in Dulak for the last four levels but now they are starting to turn yellow was hoping to upgrade if possible.<br />
What level would you think the absolute minimun I would need to be to solo in Nc.<br />
No magelo yet but will be wearing full set of home made expert DON with all other slots twinked nicely (As soon as I ding and it lets me get the blasted task for the symbols).<br />

Thanks <br />
