<br />
Quest 2 - Eitrigg's Wisdom<br />
<br />
Speak to Warlord Goretooth at the guardtower near Kargath in the Badlands.<br />
<br />
Rend lives?<br />
<br />
Impossible!<br />
<br />
It had been thought that Rend was slain decades ago.<br />
<br />
Seek out the wisdom of Eitrigg. None know the workings of the Blackrock better than he and if what is written here bares truth, Eitrigg should be informed. No person should be denied the right of vengeance.<br />
<br />
You will find him in Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
Once you have spoken with Eitrigg, confer with the Warchief to find out what he wishes to do about this problem.<br />
<br />
Speak with Eitrigg in Orgrimmar. When you have discussed matters with Eitrigg, seek council from Thrall.<br />
<br />
You recall having seen Eitrigg in Thrall's chamber.<br />
<br />
Find Entrigg in Thralls Chambers in Orgrimmar to complete this step. You'll need to talk to Thrall afterwards for the next step.<br />
<br />
Quest 3 - For The Horde!<br />
<br />
Speak to Thrall in Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
Rend dares make such grand claims because of the protection he is afforded by the black flight.<br />
<br />
You, will find a way to pass through the Halls of Ascension. You will then find 'Warchief' Rend Blackhand and you will destroy him - FOR THE HORDE!<br />
<br />
&lt;Thrall slams a fist down upon his throne.&gt;<br />
<br />
The next time you return to my chambers, you will hold his head high in triumph and then you shall present it to your Warchief. Do this and be honored as a hero of the Horde.<br />
<br />
Travel to Blackrock Spire and slay Warchief Rend Blackhand. Take his head and return to Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
Slay Rend in Upper Blackrock Spire <br />
http://worldofwarcraft.gameamp.com/game_map/game_map/81.php <br />
<br />
This is a Raid Quest doable with up to 15 people.  Rend is located at location 3 on the linked map.  Rend is a Fun event.  You'll need to make sure your raid is prepared for the event as all must be inside the Arena at the start or be locked out for the duration.  When you approach the center of the Arena; Lord Victor Nefarius and Warchief Rend Blackhand are up above and there will be a short dialog, they then start sending in waves of Dragonkin and Handlers.  Kill the Waves while being verbally taunted by the two spectators, once the waves are completed Lord Victor will send Rend in to finish you off.  Rend flys in on his Dragon mount Glyth.  Once Rend and Glyth are dead loot Rends head and return to Thrall.<br />
<br />
Upon Turning the head in to Thrall you will have the choice of 3 Blue Trinket's as a Reward.  Thrall will also give a shout to the city and cast Warchief's Blessing on everyone in Town at the time.  <br />
<br />
Quest 4 - What the Wind Carries<br />
<br />
Speak to Thrall in Orgimmar<br />
<br />
It is good to see you again. The wind carries with it news from the Eastern Kingdom.<br />
<br />
Sit, listen. <br />
<br />
Listen to Thrall<br />
<br />
Listen to Thralls Story to complete this step and get the next Quest.<br />
<br />
Quest 5 - The Champion of the Horde<br />
<br />
Speak to Thrall after listening to his story<br />
<br />
I have received word from one of my champions that a way into the lair of the dragon may exist. You are to seek him out.<br />
<br />
Rexxar wanders the desert wasteland of Desolace, traveling between Stonetalon and Feralas. He awaits your arrival<br />
<br />
Seek out Rexxar. The Warchief has instructed you as to his whereabouts. Search the paths of Desolace, between the Stonetalon Mountains and Feralas<br />
<br />
Find Rexxar he and his Bear wander the Road through Desolace between Stonetalon and Feralas.<br />
<br />
Quest 6 - The Testament of Rexxar <br />
<br />
Speak to Rexxar in Desolace <br />
<br />
What do you know of illusions? For you see, it is an illusion that you must create in order to circumvent the Black Flight's defenses.<br />
<br />
I know of one that may be willing to assist you in your quest of deception. She has assisted our kind in the past when she has deemed the cause worthy.<br />
<br />
In the Western Plaguelands you will find Myranda the Hag, master illusionist - an exile of the Lordaeron alliance. Travel there and take with you this message.<br />
<br />
Deliver Rexxar's Testament to Myranda the Hag in the Western Plaguelands.<br />
<br />
Find Myranda the Hag in Western Plaguelands and deliver Rexxar's Testament.  Myranda is located near Uther's Tomb near Sorrow Hill.<br />
<br />
 Quest 7 - Oculus Illusions <br />
<br />
Speak to Myranda the Hag in Western Plaguelands<br />
<br />
So the &lt;Race&gt; wishes to become one of the Black Flight, eh?<br />
<br />
The creation of the illusion you require is trivial, but the components required for the divination are quite difficult to obtain. Rexxar and the Warchief have entrusted you with this mission, so Myranda must assume you as capable.<br />
<br />
Travel to the upper citadel of Blackrock Spire and slay enough of the black dragonspawn to fill up one of your packs with their eyes.<br />
<br />
Return to Myranda when you have gathered enough of the reagent<br />
<br />
Travel to Blackrock Spire and collect 20 Black Dragonspawn Eyes. Return to Myranda the Hag when the task is complete.<br />
<br />
This is a Raid quest you can eyes drop off any of the Dragonsin in Upper Blackrock Spire, including those in the hatchery.<br />
<br />
Once you have the 20 eyes return to Myranda to complete this step and begin the next.<br />
<br />
Quest 8 - Emberstrife <br />
<br />
Talk to Myranda the Hag in Westernplaguelands. She will give you the Amulet of Draconic Subversion that will allow you to speak to Emberstrife.<br />
<br />
I have attuned this medallion with the magic necessary to create and maintain an illusion within the bounds of the den of Emberstrife.<br />
<br />
Emberstrife is an ancient drake; an old gatekeeper of Nefarian, burdened with the duty to test those dragonspawn that would ascend to the rank of elite guard to Onyxia.<br />
<br />
Travel to the Wyrmbog of Dustwallow Marsh and enter the lair of Emberstrife. Once there, put on the amulet and follow where your destiny may lead! <br />
<br />

<br />
Quest 9 - The Test of Skulls, Scryer<br />
<br />
While wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion Speak to Emberstrife in Dustwallow Marsh.<br />
<br />
We are Deathwing's children, whelp. Our dominance over the lesser Aspects must be enforced.<br />
<br />
If you are truly worthy of ascension, the lesser dragonflight will wilt in your presence.<br />
<br />
Find their champions and lay waste to them in the name of our Father!<br />
<br />
Travel to Winterspring and track down the mighty blue drake, Scryer. Crush him and any of the Blue Flight that stand in your path. Tear out his skull and return it to me.<br />
<br />
You must find the blue dragonflight drake champion, Scryer, and slay him. Pry his skull from his corpse and return it to Emberstrife.<br />
<br />
You know that Scryer can be found in Winterspring.<br />
<br />
Scryer is a level 60ish elite Dragon located in the Blue Dragon Cave in Winterspring.  The dragon cave is in the Mazthoril secton of Winterspring and is Guarded by Elite Blue Dragonkin.  Deep within the Cave is Scryer slay him and take his skull, then return to Emberstrife while wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion.<br />
<br />
Quest 10 - The Test of Skulls, Sommnus<br />
<br />
While wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion speak to Emberstrife in Duskwallow Marsh.<br />
<br />
Just as our Father crushes the Aspects themselves, so too must we strive to bring chaos and destruction to their children.<br />
<br />
You must test your battle prowess against the sleepless dreamers: The children of the Green Flight.<br />
<br />
Travel to the Swamp of Sorrows and track down Somnus, drake champion of the Green Flight. Let flow your hatred; dominate the insect... Return to me with his skull...<br />
<br />
Destroy the drake champion of the Green Flight, Somnus. Take his skull and return it to Emberstrife.<br />
<br />
Somnus is a level 62 Elite Green Dragon.  He is located in Swamp of Sorrows to the east of The Temple of Atal'Hakkar.  He roams in a circle so find a location near the lake that is free of spawn and wait for his approach.  Slay him and take his skull.  Return with his skull to Emberstrife in Dustwallow Marsh while wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion.<br />
<br />
Quest 11 - The Test of Skulls, Chronalis<br />
<br />
While wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion speak to Emberstrife in Duskwallow Marsh.<br />
<br />
The time watchers, children of Nozdormu - Lord of the Centuriesss...<br />
<br />
It is three that guard the Caverns of Time, but only one that holds the interests of the Black Flight: The Time Shifter, Chronalis, favored drakeling of Nozdormu.<br />
<br />
Ssstrike at this champion, a blow to make even the stoic sands of time weep. Return to me with his skull.<br />
<br />
Guarding the Caverns of Time in the Tanaris Desert is Chronalis, child of Nozdormu. Destroy him and return his skull to Emberstrife.<br />
<br />

<br />
Quest 12 - The Test of Skulls, Axtoroz<br />
<br />
While wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion speak to Emberstrife in Duskwallow Marsh.<br />
<br />
It was over the mountains of Grim Batol that our Father raged against the combined might of the Aspects. The cowardly act of the betrayer, Alexstrasza, bought the other Aspects enough time to escape from Father's wrath.<br />
<br />
Sssuch a shameful act...<br />
<br />
The Red Flight now guards Grim Batol, their lieutenant, Axtroz, must be destroyed. Return the skull of Axtroz to me. For Father, whelp!<br />
<br />
Travel to Grim Batol and track down Axtroz, drake champion of the Red Flight. Destroy him and take his skull. Return the skull to Emberstrife.<br />
<br />
Axtroz is a Level 62 Elite Dragon located at the Dragonmaw Gates in The Wetlands.  There are elite Red Dragonkin Guarding the area as well, so clear them first then slay him and take his skull.  Return with his skull to Emberstrife in Dustwallow Marsh while wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion. <br />
<br />
Quest 13 - Ascension ...<br />
<br />
While wearing the Amulet of Draconic Subversion speak to Emberstrife in Duskwallow Marsh.<br />
<br />
From the skulls of our enemies is shaped a medallion. You know this medallion, yesss? You have no doubt seen it worn by your elders.<br />
<br />
Take it, whelp. Return to the Spire and present it to General Drakkisath. The General will place the final enchantment upon the medallion, attuning the trinket to your spirit.<br />
<br />
You will wear the finished medallion as a badge of honor, symbolizing your ascension to one of our most guarded ranks: Guardian to the brood mother.<br />
<br />
Go!<br />
<br />
It would appear as if the charade is over. You know that the Amulet of Draconic Subversion that Myranda the Hag created for you will not function inside Blackrock Spire. Perhaps you should find Rexxar and explain your predicament. Show him the Dull Drakefire Amulet. Hopefully he will know what to do next.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take the Dull Drakefire Amulet to Rexxar in Desolace, you will find him wandering the road between Feralas and Stonetalon.<br />
<br />
Quest 14 - Blood of the Black Dragon Champion<br />
<br />
Speak to Rexxar in Desolace<br />
<br />
You will pay the General a visit, yes, but not as one of the Black Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
You see, a ceremony is merely another term for blood letting to the Black Flight.<br />
<br />
The latent amulet merely needs the blood of the General in order to become active. One of their crude failsafe mechanisms.<br />
<br />
Return to Blackrock Spire and destroy Drakkisath. Bring his blood back here and I shall activate the key to Onyxia's lair.<br />
<br />
Travel to Blackrock Spire and slay General Drakkisath. Gather his blood and return it to Rexxar.<br />
<br />
This is the Final fight of the quest series.  It is a raid quest and can be done with the assistance of up to 15 others in Upper Blackrockspire.<br />
<br />
http://worldofwarcraft.gameamp.com/game_map/game_map/81.php <br />
<br />
General Drakkisath is located at location #1 on the linked map.  He is flanked by 2 Level Dragonkin Guards.  You will need to Slay the General and get his blood and return it to Rexxar in Desolace.<br />
<br />
The reward for this quest is Drakefire Amulet (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=16309) and is the key to Onyxia's Lair.<br />
<br />
A Few Notes about this Quest Series <br />
<br />
 Each individual that wishes to participate in an Onyxia Raid will need their own Drakefire Amulet to Enter Onyxia's Lair<br />
 The General currently drops 2-4 blood per raid, so you may need to do that fight many times to get blood for yourself and your friends/guild.  <br />
 The Warchiefs Blessing Buff does not stack with itself so to get the most out of the Rend head turn in space it out, everyone in Org will appreciate the buff.<br />
 Only the UBRS portions of the series can be done in Raid Group all others are single group quests.  <br />
 None of the fights should be attempted solo.</div></div><hr />

I think this was changed this patch to have a few drops per kill.</div></div><hr />
