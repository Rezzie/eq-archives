<br />
I've been looking for a druid community ever since I began playing mine more regularly and I somehow missed this one until now. <br />
<br />
For the past almost three years I have played a warrior tank, been a guild officer, raid leader and the main tank. My alts were a mage and hunter and I had a druid stashed on my character list doing duty as a second bank toon. When the expansion hit, I became disillusioned with my guild and transferred my warrior and mage to another server and raided with another guild. I will spare you the long, sad story but things didn't work out mainly because I missed my friends but with my &quot;mains&quot; marooned on another server, I picked up the druid and got him to Outland. <br />
<br />
Well, another guild change and server transfer later, I have joined a friends guild and they are set with tanks. So....after a month and a half of playing him as my main, I realize there are alot of things I need to learn and improve on to be a better player. <br />
<br />
If the name didn't give it away, I am full resto and despite an acute lack of gear in some slots, I heal competatively in mid SSCish content. But I get the sinking feeling I'm winging it and getting by when I could be so much better. <br />
<br />
I know my warrior inside and out and am a contributor on Tankspot.com. He's &quot;me&quot; but day by day, I get a little more comfortable with my druid. Hopefully, finding a community will help that. <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<br />
There are tons of helpful things we could talk about for Resto Druids.  It might help if you talk about what you do, how you do it and what you think you want to know.  I did a brief stint as a resto druids in Kara.  I enjoyed it, and I was really damned good at it, but my heart for this character is and always will be Feral.  So shoot us some questions and we'll offer dozens of different perspectives and advice.  We have Theorycrafters and &quot;by the seat of their pantsers&quot; as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My Resto is a bit dusty because I have focused more on my Feral since BC came out, but I have played her from time to time.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom is &quot;teh roxx0rz&quot;, so to say :)<br />
The healing per second you get out of it combined with its low mana usage make it the perfect tool for many situations.<br />
<br />
A tip I got from a friend that really helped me out: If you have 2 tanks that you need to heal, make yourself macros for them.<br />
<br />
Macro 1:<br />
/cast [target=Allahanastar] Lifebloom<br />
<br />
Macro 2:<br />
/cast [target=Annikk] Lifebloom<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course you have to enter the correct names for your tanks at the beginning of every raid or encounter, but thats done pretty fast.<br />
Put those on buttons you can easily reach. No matter what your current target is, that macro will cast a heal on the player you specify without changing your current target.<br />
<br />
That way you will have no problems keeping 2 stacks of Lifeblooms on your tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also get yourself a good timer addon. One that can show you for each target which HoTs are on them, and how much longer they will run.<br />
<br />
Playing a Tree is all about timing your HoTs, and knowing who will get damage before they do. You can heal reactively (Nature's Swiftness and Swiftmend are great tools for that), but being one step ahead in your heals is the far better playstyle. <br />
<br />
Sometimes it is necessary to throw out a NS+NT, so don't be afraid to do so. Losing that 1,5k mana (NT and Tree form) is better than having the tank die.</div></div><hr />
