<br />
The tunic i believe, needs a primal earth rune... off the sambata primalist in DSP<br />
<br />
The leggings i believe, need a Sack of Purified soil from a Grol Baku Geomancer in Scarlet Desert.<br />
<br />
Now here is my problem. I have been looking for these mobs for weeks. I searched everywhere online for information about them and only found info on the primalist.<br />
<br />
So where is the geomancer? in scarlet desert is all I can find. No idea who is the PH, where it spawns, etc....<br />
<br />
HELP! Where is this little bugger? How and where do I get it?</div></div><hr />

Although I have seen more rares wandering outside the cave, you would probably want to clear those ones out first.</div></div><hr />

Where does it spawn? What if any, is the place holder? I have all the pieces for the Earth Blessed Leggings from Twilight sea, except a Sack of Purified Soil, which this mob drops... been trying for weeks and no luck.... anyone have any information? Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talloak</div><div class="date">01-04-2003, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">now, i know what killing mass mobs in hopes of a rare pop is. My point is that I've done that over and over, both by myself and with groups. Been there 6 hours with a group working both camps and still nothing. Any chance this little bugger pops in a different zone and I was misinformed? If so, where?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synshade</div><div class="date">01-07-2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As one who's wearing the Earth Blessed Tunic from this quest, may I suggest looking to going to Umbral for an Elysian Tunic instead?  The final Sambata Primalist piece for the Earth Blessed is extremely difficult to find from that spawn.  You're much more like to find the Elysian Tunic from someone who already has one (they're no drop/lore) or with a group of other druids rooting/dot'ing these things.  Look at the stats, the Elysian is fairly superior....albeit UGLY.  The Earth Blessed Tunic just looks like a Shroud of Nature except its slightly darker tinted.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />
