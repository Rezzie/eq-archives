You have 15 minutes.  You have to kill 20 mobs.  The pop randomly below a center platform and you have to pull em in or they run down a ramp and depop, much like poj trials.<br />
<br />
Once 15 minutes is up.  Yellow named in center attacks and becomes targetable ( if you have killed 20 )  He isnt too hard.<br />
<br />
BTW. dont get off the platform.  you'll take a deathtouch.  losing results in a lockout timer of 1hour 45mins on all trials. winning results in 1 day lockout for trial you did and 1hour 45min for rest.<br />
<br />
Some nice loot including a belt that can drop that has right clicky Maelin's Methodical Mind ( 8mana, 5regen / tick )</div></div><hr />

I did it one day and we killed less than 20 and spawned the named.  Went back a few days later and killed about 30 and lost.  May have just been a bug though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kryttos Arcadia</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">weird. done it 4 times.   You have to kill 20 in 15 mins.. but that doesnt mean more than 20 will spawn before time is up. We killed 25 the last round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galain</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah it was really strange.  We think 1 may have run to the zone in and caused our loss.  Was just really weird because I know we killed at least 10 more than we did on our win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larellion</div><div class="date">10-29-2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have won five of the six single group trials most zoning in on a first attempt blind and working out a strategy from what we learned.  The fun in these trials to my mind is doing just that, the two I had previous knowledge (not spoiler but some details) the overall feeling at winning is no where near the same as working them out for myself.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be try them yourself before reading spoiler info's sense of achievement is worth more than the quick win, they only have a two hour lockout not like you cant just exp in PG and go again.<br />
<br />
Padrick if you do not wish to heed the above PM me and I will send you a brief overview of each trial, but certainly not a spoiler.</div></div><hr />
