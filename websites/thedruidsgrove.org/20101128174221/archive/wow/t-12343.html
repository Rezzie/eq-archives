The kind of angry that starts with a sinking feeling in your stomach that just seems to expand until all you can see is red?  <br />
<br />
Well, I have.  Several times.  I won't bore you with the details, because - to be honest, I've pretty much posted all of them here on the Grove anyway.  My most recent was an entire raid screaming at me in Ventrilo for &quot;over-healing&quot; the tank and pulling aggro.  Ya, ya.  I know.  Stupid move.  Thus the anger.<br />
<br />
We've all had crappy experiences, but, what's the one that made you come dangerously close to hanging up your mouse?<br />

<br />
I'm part of a very casual (almost too social for me) non-raiding guild (we do run kara from time-to-time).  I like to help lowbees when I can to break up leveling or rep grinding, etc.  Last night a warlock wanted to get their mount.  They needed a tank.<br />
<br />
I told them I had ~80min before I was done for the night.  So, we need to make this trip rather quick.<br />
<br />
Group: Me (tank), Shammy (healin'), 61 warlock, 64 warlock, 70 warlock.  (frankly, I'm not sure they even needed me)<br />
<br />
Strike 1:  No one knew where DM west's entrance was located.<br />
Strike 2:  Assuming we were actually in DM west, no one knew where to go.<br />
Strike 3:  Once we started going somewhere, we got to a point in which no one knew want to do to continue our progress (had to do something to drop some shield around a boss)<br />
<br />
I thought I was going to kill myself.  It was so painful.  Since I told them up-front about my time constraints and warned them several times during the run, I did not feel the least bit guilty leaving at the strike of midnight.<br />
<br />
Why on-earth would 3 Warlocks (only 1 needed his mount), not have a ficken' clue as to where to go?  If I had a class quest that required help, you better believe I'd have every detail of the quest's requirements/notes memorized.  I learned that I need to ask a few questions before I agree to help lowbees in (to me) unfamiliar instances.<br />
<br />
Not quite a &quot;I'm gonna quit&quot; story, but it certainly felt like it.<br />
<br />
I did quit last spring with my hunter 'cause once I reached 70, I got sick and tired of trying to get into a group (and I was a good PvE hunter).  A few months later, I came back knowing I wanted to play a class that would not have an issue finding a spot in a 5-man.  I was down to Druid and Priest.  Druid won (flexible end-game options, plus good solo DPS options regardless of spec) and I couldn't be happier.</div></div><hr />

Never have I ever came close to wanting to quit but that doesn't mean I haven't had bad experiences...they just don't affect my happy aura. Sometimes hopping on an alt helps me love the game when I don't feel like playing my druid. <br />
<br />
Guild chat and talking to friends while in bad PuGs really helps relieve the stress of unlucky groups.<br />
<br />
Only time I quit was during finals (1month break) and whenever I go on vacation.</div></div><hr />

Ya - it was an actual heal...and I just kept on doing it, like an idiot.  :bonk: Sooo stupid.<br />

Very true.  But that craziness happens sometimes.  In fact, I helped a Pally get his mount and at one point he went psychotic and started yelling at a Rogue for not knowing which dungeon we were supposed to run first - I think there are two if I recall correctly.  I whispered the Rogue as to why he was being blamed and he honestly did not know.  He was the highest level at the time, and I guess the Pally was simply overstressed and venting at the wrong (but fortunately very patient) person.</div></div><hr />

Things weren't going well in the raids, officers were having heated debates than were starting to turn into arguments, the whole thing got really messy eventually.  It's one thing to screw up and wipe the raid, but to have a whole guild place their trust in you and to not be able to deliver, is really a lot harder to deal with.<br />
<br />
I think I can see where this is going though.  Don't worry, everyone (EVERYONE) wipes the raid at some point.  I've done it, I've seen others do it - these things just happen.  It's a horrible feeling, and it's difficult to put it into perspective when it's happening right here, right now - to you - but seriously.. try not to sweat it.  :&gt;  As long as you are suitably apologetic and accept that you were at fault if you clearly were, nobody will care or even remember about it the following day.<br />

I ran straight and without hesitation into the Ballroom on the way to Moroes once.  <br />
<br />
Apparently, I felt like dancing.  :o</div></div><hr />

When I was first learning the Nightbane fight, he landed on my head after his air phase.  Crushed me for 25k.  Yes, I was a dead tree.<br />

Whisper from Guild Master &amp; Raid Leader: &quot;You're the bomb!&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;LOL What?&quot;<br />
Group: &quot;Kyane!  Run!!!&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Woah, why am I all....uh oh...&quot;<br />

Heh, that ballroom is funny.<br />
<br />
You know as you go up the stairs towards it?  I swear to god every time I go up those stairs, I hear _something_ stealthed nearby.  Every damn time.  Then I turn around to look for it, but no matter how much I run up and down, I don't hear it again.<br />
Next time I zone in, it happens again...<br />
<br />
The first time I saw the ballroom, I wanted to see what was inside the next room (it later turned out to contain Moroes and friends).  So I shifted to cat form and stealthed up, and started creeping towards the adjoining archway.<br />
Then, suddenly...<br />
<br />
Phantom Valet says: Hey! Where do you think you are going, sneaking around like that?<br />
<br />
Me: Ummm....<br />
<br />
:: creeps forward a little more, hoping to sneak by ::<br />
<br />
:: squash ::<br />
<br />
<br />
I was leading the raid at the time.  After running back, I informed a quietly giggling raid that I couldn't stealth past and we'd have to kill our way through.<br />
Ho hum. :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">02-05-2008, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I don't recall ever being angry enough to want to quit WoW entirely... I've gotten mad enough to log off for the night, but most of the reasoning behind those log-offs are to do with me getting pissy at people being rude etc.  <br />
<br />
The most recent time I did that was when I was trying to farm ore on my pally.  I saw a rich adamantite vein, flew down, dismounted, got attacked by 2 earth elemental thingies of course, so I was trying to kill them, and I'm prot, so yeah, killing takes a while, when a hordie flies down, takes the ore with me RIGHT NEXT TO IT, in combat.  I shoulda bubbled, but I had already had a tiring day, and I just started seeing red, so I didn't think about it, then logged for the night.  I mean yeah, sure, whatever, that's not exactly rule-breaking or anything, and sadly a lot of people justify doing stuff like that, but to me it's simply rude.  <br />
<br />
I think I did that one other time when in a group where an item I wanted got DE'd before I got a chance to say I needed it.  Sad thing is it was done by a guildie in my old guild, so I hadn't been paying uber close attention to loot rules etc (I'm more careful in PuGs, but when it's a guild run I just kinda expect people to take the time to say &quot;anyone need?&quot;, it takes what, all of 2 seconds).  When I complained about it I basically got ridiculed for &quot;being slow&quot;, which seemed really rude to me, so I logged, then vowed to never again group with that person, they were an idiot anyways.  &gt;.&gt;  <br />
<br />
I guess I can be sensitive at times, but meh.<br />
<br />
And man, I've wiped 5/10-man groups so often, haha, it really doesn't even phase me often anymore, unless it's a 25-man.  I'm kinda a suicidal tank, if you will, the people I run heroics with KNOW that, so they expect mishaps from time to time.  When I run with friends I just kinda relax, usually refusing to mark pulls (unless it's a new instance), chain pulling with an eye on my healer's mana, etc.  Hell, even when I run with my healer friend and 3 DPS pugs, I tend to do the same, haha, I just tell the DPS at the beginning that they need to assist off me.  I've been doing more heroics on my pally here lately, so no need for CC usually, makes it easy (and when there's a rogue buddy I know in my group, I just tell 'em to &quot;sap something at the end&quot; without even marking it, they know what to do).  &gt;.&gt;   <br />
<br />
Anyways, yeah, from time to time I do wipe the group by pulling 297329729 things at once, and we laugh about it.  Last week I was doing a heroic SH with my pally, and we were doing great, up til that area with the gladiator pulls on the sides.  We had no CC with us and were kinda time constrained (plus no one needed the enchant), so my priest friend and I decided not to pull the guys on the sides after the first pull of 'em.  So we go up the middle, I prepare to pull the big legionare pack in the middle of the next area, shield toss, run back to LoS 'em all behind a wall, instinctively go behind the wall on the side where we DIDN'T kill the gladiator guys, and my friend starts screaming over vent &quot;WRONG SIDE, WRONG SIDE!&quot;  I'm like &quot;Oh SH--!&quot;, but it was too late, I had already aggroed them.  &gt;.&gt;  We laughed about that one for a while.  xD  It's funny how tanking becomes so habitual sometimes, even as far as LoS placements etc.<br />
<br />
Everyone still considers me a great tank, but yeah, I admit it, I get lazy and suicidal in 5-mans, heroics, and Kara.  It's more fun that way.  :D<br />
<br />
I was embearessed one time in a TK raid, though, when I wiped the raid on Al'ar.  I had been wearing my cowl thingy that turns you into a broken for the BT attunement line, just for fun, had already completed the quest, but since I'm easily amused I decided not to turn it in right away so I could keep using it.  Well, I musta been kind of tired that night or something.  We were in phase 1, I was one of the tanks on the platforms.  Flamequill hits, I jump down, one of the other tanks dies, so I run over and brez them (I was on one of the middle platforms), go cat, dash my way back up to the platform.  Well, I cut it kinda close timing wise, it had taken me longer to get in range with the dead guy than I thought, so I barely made it back on my platform in time.  Since I'm in the broken costume I can't visually tell what form I'm in.  I remembered to shift out of CAT, but what I forgot before hopping in range with Al'ar was to shift into BEAR.  I got crushed for like 16k in caster form and wiped the raid.  It was awesome.  &gt;.&gt;  <br />
<br />
Let's just say I use my broken costume on all the other fights in TK EXCEPT Al'ar these days.  xD  I really did feel bad about that one, lol, it was so dumb on my part.</div></div><hr />

You know those big &quot;dog-like&quot; beasts guarding the top of the stairs after Chess?  The ones that hit like a Mack Truck?<br />
<br />
Well, my Pally Tank runs up the stairs to pull 'em back down to the chess room.  I took this opportunity to adjust my keyboard.  I ALWAYS have my tank targeted (I am healer), and while moving my keyboard around, I somehow hit one of my healing keys without knowing it.  :clap: <br />
<br />
So, we all stand there and watch this &quot;dog&quot; barrell down the stairs, run right past our Tank, straight for ME.  <br />
<br />
Aside from being dead before I could say &quot;WTF?&quot;, it was the most comical things I've ever seen.  Those dogs run funny. :grin:</div></div><hr />

What frustrates me more about guild leadership is the OTHER people in leadership, gah, officers/leaders get stubborn about the most stupid crap, and either are totally lazy and uncaring about everything, or judge everything using their own opinions and won't even listen to anyone else (see the moonkin thread, I whined a lot in there &gt;.&gt;).
