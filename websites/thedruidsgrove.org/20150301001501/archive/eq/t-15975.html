CBS 5) BERKELEY A Berkeley watchdog organization that tracks military spending said it uncovered a strange U.S. military proposal to create a hormone bomb that could purportedly turn enemy soldiers into homosexuals and make them more interested in sex than fighting.<br />
<br />
Pentagon officials on Friday confirmed to CBS 5 that military leaders had considered, and then subsquently rejected, building the so-called &quot;Gay Bomb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edward Hammond, of Berkeley's Sunshine Project, had used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain a copy of the proposal from the Air Force's Wright Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.<br />
<br />
As part of a military effort to develop non-lethal weapons, the proposal suggested, &quot;One distasteful but completely non-lethal example would be strong aphrodisiacs, especially if the chemical also caused homosexual behavior.&quot;<br />
<br />
The documents show the Air Force lab asked for $7.5 million to develop such a chemical weapon.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Ohio Air Force lab proposed that a bomb be developed that contained a chemical that would cause enemy soliders to become gay, and to have their units break down because all their soldiers became irresistably attractive to one another,&quot; Hammond said after reviwing the documents.<br />
<br />
&quot;The notion was that a chemical that would probably be pleasant in the human body in low quantities could be identified, and by virtue of either breathing or having their skin exposed to this chemical, the notion was that soliders would become gay,&quot; explained Hammond.<br />
<br />
The Pentagon told CBS 5 that the proposal was made by the Air Force in 1994.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Department of Defense is committed to identifying, researching and developing non-lethal weapons that will support our men and women in uniform,&quot; said a DOD spokesperson, who indicated that the &quot;gay bomb&quot; idea was quickly dismissed.<br />
<br />
However, Hammond said the government records he obtained suggest the military gave the plan much stronger consideration than it has acknowledged.<br />
<br />
&quot;The truth of the matter is it would have never come to my attention if it was dismissed at the time it was proposed,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, the Pentagon has used it repeatedly and subsequently in an effort to promote non-lethal weapons, and in fact they submitted it to the highest scientific review body in the country for them to consider.&quot;<br />
<br />
Military officials insisted Friday to CBS 5 that they are not currently working on any such idea and that the past plan was abandoned.<br />
<br />
Gay community leaders in California said Friday that they found the notion of a &quot;gay bomb&quot; both offensive and almost laughable at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Throughout history we have had so many brave men and women who are gay and lesbian serving the military with distinction,&quot; said Geoff Kors of Equality California. &quot;So, it's just offensive that they think by turning people gay that the other military would be incapable of doing their job. And its absurd because there's so much medical data that shows that sexual orientation is immutable and cannot be changed.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Why would they find it offensive?<br />
<br />
And exactly are these offended so called leaders?<br />
<br />
If I were gay, and these were my leaders, I would elect new ones.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they don't get elected. <br />
<br />
It could be like the post office, or other government job, and be a seniority thing. <br />
<br />
As to the article, I think the Pentagon should have thought harder about this line of research before it got out of the &quot;Ok, guys, brainstorm! Write down any idea that comes to mind, no matter how crazy it is!&quot; stage.</div></div><hr />

Its offensive because it implies that if you are gay, you are incapable of doing your job in the military because you are thinking about having sex with your troop the entire time. As stated in the article, there have been homosexuals in the military since the beginning of the military, just because you are gay - doesn't mean you can't be a soldier.<br />
 <br />
On the other hand, it is HILARIOUS to think that someone actually thought about making a drug that could &quot;cause&quot; homosexuality. LOL</div></div><hr />

I read that the chemical amount would be of sufficient quantity (as in not normal concentrations) as to cause the effect, not that being gay meant you were a sex maniac.  Some people live to be offended.</div></div><hr />

Let me add a punchline to the news article...  &quot;Sources say it's already been tested in San Francisco&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They'd be able to wear bright pink uniforms and you'd still not see them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what a pathetic  bomb.... might have been a dud ....... hey bob, have I ever told you those boots just so go with that uniform....<br />
<br />
why thank you dan..... have I ever told you I always enjoyed men in uniform..... <br />
<br />
hey, those pants really accentuate the l.t.'s butt...... <br />
<br />
lieutenant butterbar...... new orders guys, you will all love this...... lets all play naked twister!<br />
<br />
Hurray!<br />
<br />
All seriousness, I think if the miltiary leaders can all get it into their heads, that homosexuals are not inferior human beings and can actually put the beatdown on other soldiers that are not gay, they will be much better off. Clearly, they never actually read to much into some of the homosexual or homoerotic practices that lets say, ancient greeks, they were well known for it, and still came out to beat some ass in combat.<br />
<br />
 Or they can find out the hard way that a like holy crap fruity fairy gay miltiary unit just kicked the crap out of their navy seals, rangers, delta forces........  A better bomb idea that manipulates behaviors would be a depression bomb, a bomb that releases a chemical, non lethal, that upsets the bodies natural state and incurs a reaction that leaves you feeling depressed would work alot better. Or some other such bomb that effects morale to gain a combat advantage but, relatively harmless to enemy soldiers, like say a seratonin bomb.... releases enough seratonin over a small area and makes enemy soldiers sleepy.</div></div><hr />

Imagine all the social progress we'd make if we let the gay bomb loose in the next Republican National Convention.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure they could even get it up with viagra, cialis, levitra.  I don't know though whenever I turned on C-Span they always seemed to blow each other on the floor anyways, then, the minute they turn their backs.... stab em in it. So, I don't think it will have the desired effects other than they might redecorate their houses and capitol hill.</div></div><hr />

This is a republican only trait?  No, perhaps your views are biased.  This is a politician trait.<br />
<br />
Also, I notice, once again, everyone stopped at &quot;gay is weak&quot;.  It doesn't say gay is weak, it says it wants to make people gay (which is stupid, btw) with sufficient quantity of the chemical to make them also uncontrollably horny.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, because a majority of you do, this is a dumb idea.  However, a lot of people here live to be offended and stop reading once a contrary statement is made.<br />
<br />
It is as if I said we want to make a bomb that makes people unable to resist seeking out cheese and eating it.  Every cheese eater then gets offended.  That is the very definition of reactionary. The bomb would be to make it such that people couldn't do anythting BUT seek out and eat cheese.  It doesn't say cheese eaters are weak willed.</div></div><hr />

I prefer something that would really give an edge in combat.... such as the sleep bomb, simpler idea, many conventional reasons, good for discrete interventions, good for flanking maneuvers, direct assaults, you name it. Not something that will make everyone incredibly hot for each other.  Yet, the fact remains they asked for something like this repeatedly, kinda implies something.  I just do not see the usefullness of this in a combat situtation.<br />
<br />
 At the very worst, what could happen is morale of the victims' unit could actually increase by having intercourse with each other, and ends up giving them the advantage. Or even worse than that.... strolling through a town....... you can get the picture there I am sure. Generally, the miltiary principles has been to degrade, impede, or otherwise destroy the opposing forces ability and will to fight. I just do not see how this would be effective or contrived more than once.</div></div><hr />

The Yeti's hair can be easily dyed into a multitude of colors, like a rainbow, to express his open and undying love for the sasquatch.<br />
<br />
I heard ole' Nessie was looking for her lover the other day as well when she surfaced just below water a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I don't know though..... I am off to a Jewel concert.... alone(and not the first time to her either), although a female friend of mine will be there...... maybe I should bunk up with the sasquatch and the yeti tonight. $20 bucks that the sasquatch needs to cuddle afterwards.</div></div><hr />
