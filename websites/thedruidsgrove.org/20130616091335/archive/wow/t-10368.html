The first step of this is the bracers. The quest leads you to silithus where you have to collect 15 venoms. <br />
<br />
The following step takes you to Burning Steppes to get Volcanic Ash. Really easy to get...took me 5 minutes. They have to be turned in with other mats that are listed that can be bought on the AH. <br />
<br />
The next quest isnt that difficult as it is long. It will lead you to Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, and Silithus where you have to drop an item and kill mobs within the aura. You have to collect, I believe, 12 of each of these from these mobs. You turn these in and it sends you out to Burning Steppes to kill a boss that is a joke. (Can be solo'd easily by a 55 I would guess) You go back to gadgetzan to turn it and the quest sends you to Winterspring where you have to buy an item off an Imp way down south for 50g. Once you turn this quest in, you will have gotten your gloves, belt, and bracers.<br />
<br />
I am at this step in the quest chain and now have to head to UD strat for what I presume is the 45 min Baron run. After the second gate drops, you have 45 mins to clear the Abominations, Abom Boss, Skeles, 6 Elite Guards, and then the Baron.....all in 5 man. Should be the most difficult so far.</div></div><hr />

Has anyone tried upgrading non-soulbound items?  Can you make feralheart bracers for the AH for instance, or are the upgrades soulbound?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can get the Rod from the Imp when you're collecting Blood Samples for the bracers (the first part of the chain). Also note rogues and druids can easily stealth past the 59 elites, the rod is unique but not BoP. (I used my druid to get one, hit town mail it to my hunt, then go back for one for my druid).</div></div><hr />

Though I wish one could just get the set straight out, not have to do a questline.<br />
<br />
And damn blizz for not letting us upgrade SC...<br />
I still want my feral set \8 L</div></div><hr />

The price of some of the mats is painful enough, but to add the pain of 40g here 50g, and another 40g here.  OUCHY.</div></div><hr />

You're right, its expensive for just &quot;upgrading&quot;, but I'd pony up the money in an instant though I'd have to scratch around to get it.<br />
Honestly this is the set I want now so I can go get my PvP set, I might get better pieces but this is THE coolest looking set yet besides PvP...unlike the power rangers costume AQ gives you.<br />
<br />
I'm rambling, I know <br />
<br />
But if you add up the stats its in excess of 400, and nothing is better than overall stats for a druid. I mean if you have more int than you want then nuke and then go feral or just heal a bit more. You've got to be as bored as I am if you're reading all of this.Yet with feralheart i know I can definitely get PvP set I want so badly.<br />
<br />
I'll go post somewhere else now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I don't mind paying to upgrade, and I think the upgrade is totally worthwhile, especially for my build, the fact that I have to buy a 50g rod in winterspring, 40g to the guy in Tanaris, 40g to the lady in IF, 50g in mats ( and that's just getting to upgrade the bracers and 1/2 way through the upgrade of the belt/gloves ( I think that's what I've spent about ) it's just a hefty fine for the NPC payments AND the mats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainlight</div><div class="date">04-04-2006, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This quest is a huge gold sink, I did the Gloves / Belt quest(s) today for the better part of 9 hours and over 120g spent to date just on forking over cash for the quests.  I farmed all the stuff I needed myself (stonescale eels, I raised fishing from 100 until I started catching them reliably).  <br />
<br />
Then I find out the next piece is to finish a baron run in &lt;45 mins? I don't think that's even possible with everyday pugs with greens / blues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">04-04-2006, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keep in mind the instances have been edited since the patch too, so you should find fewer trash mobs.  From what I hear if you can avoid a wipe it isn't too bad now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-04-2006, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the instances have the same mobs. Its just lower number of players in the instance.<br />
<br />
I have now obtained 6/8 of the Feralheart set and am quickly working through the last chain to get the last 2 epic pieces. I should get it completed within the next 2 days. Its quite a fun chain looking back on it but it does take skill to run 45 min strat.<br />
<br />
I have better healing gear and better feral gear but this set is just too cool to pass up. I already had full Wildheart and wanted a true, good, hyrbid set. I cant wait to spec moonkin and try it out. :wiggle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">04-04-2006, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still need belt, shoulders, boots, chest and cowl.  At least the instance runs will be fun, but with the OT I have to put it, won't be happening for a few weeks *doh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-05-2006, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the 45 min Baron run, there are many other quests you still have to do. I would venture to say that the Baron is only 50% through the quest chain.<br />
<br />
Once you have Baron down in 45, you have to collect warbeads from DM which is a pain, collect a ethrel essence from DM, took long as well, and turn in various other mats such as Large Brilliant Shards and Dark Runes. You will need the 150g Brazier from Argent Dawn as well.<br />
<br />
After all these, you do a BRD encounter (5v5 PvP kinda thing) and finish the last step before you get the shoulders, kilt, and boots. Then you begin collecting even rarier quest items from 60 elite mobs that have a .01% drop rate. After each quest item you collect, your next step is going into an instance and summoning a boss to fight. So far Ive taken down the DM east boss who is impossible unless you drain her completely of her mana. Ive spent alot less gold since the beginning but the travel times and grinding for quest items has increased 4 fold.<br />
<br />
I will have the quest done by tonight or tomorrow however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and seeing how hard feralheart set is it might not even be worth the time.<br />
<br />
Atleast the SC setbonus aint +daggers anymore, Yey!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As opposed to a cheaper Walmart bra?  You really shouldn't skimp on quality you know :P<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Anyway!  In case anyone wants to know, the Feralheart pieces are BOP so I don't think it's possible to upgrade a non-soulbound BOE Wildheart item and sell it afterwards.<br />
<br />
(I think I saw someone ask about that before)<br />
<br />
So much for the extra set of bracers I have sitting in the bank... *sigh*</div></div><hr />

I used to be able to find at least 2 or 3 each of the belt, gloves and bracers, but no longer.  I haven't seen the belt in 2 weeks now.  Guess I just have to start running Scholo and wait for the drop.<br />
<br />
I just hate that I rarely have time during the week to run instances *sigh*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea so Im at the last part of the quest, summoning Lord Valthalak. If you thought any of the rest of this quest was difficult, think again. This guy is on par with ZG bosses. He is an elite skull guy that hits upwards of 1k. <br />
<br />
During the first phse of the fight, he summons helpers that soul link themselves to people and basically put that person out of commision. They cant move, cast, drink, anything. If you dont kill the mob within 7-10 seconds, it kills the player. He spawns these....oh........once every 5 seconds. So meanwhile your trying to dps this elite boss and kill his stupid adds. I am going to get the best group together from my guild and get really prepared for this guy. He is no joke. You will not complete this set unless you have a guild with raid experience. Trust me.</div></div><hr />
