<br />
TIZMAKS &amp; DRAKKEL DIRE WOLVES in GD: <br />
<br />
Tizmarks are great starters, then moving to dire wolves by the giants(this will teach you how to pull some mobs without getting others. AND I learned there how to pull a pack without snaring them until I got to my safe quad area). If you do get giant adds, run em to the coldain guard houses.  <br />
<br />
-Europa<br />
<br />
Tizmaks are also a good mob to kite, especially if you are just starting to learn how, just snare the two at one of the three entrances (I used the middle one). There is enough room to get them in a tight circle. Just becareful of the one that litterly falls out of the sky to the left of the entrance.<br />
These guys are also great if you dont feel comfortable with duel kiting yet, just harmony, pull one with snare, root, dot and slow roast. If you get into trouble the zone to Thurgadine (sp?) is close and they dont run very fast. BTW once the spawn is broken, they pop every 3 minutes, never had a chance to get to full mana, usually took them out with three bubbles<br />
<br />
-Naed <br />
<br />
ULTHORKS &amp; WALRUS in EW:<br />
<br />
Ulthorks in EW, in the Northern half. Another good druid area. Quad the Hunters and walrus if you start early around 38 or so. Add Warriors to you quad around 40-41 (depending on mana pool).   Ulthorks hunters and warriors and the walruses all have the same base movement so they can be mixed for quadding pretty easily. They will turn and run but only when there is just one left.  <br />
<br />
Walruses and Ulthork hunters both give exp at 42, but some are green. Warriors are all blue. <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway on to my real point... I went down to the South of EW to the Man O War spawn area. I discovered to my delight that about 2:3 of them are blue at 55 as well! The only problem is the spawn rate. They are really low in numbers most of the time. <br />
<br />
I ended up kiting one or two Man O Wars and anything up to 8 walruses at a time to clear the spawn table for more Man O Wars. Yes I know you can only hit 4 at once with Lightning but it takes 6 casts to drop the Ulthork and only 3 for the walrus so you can take them all down as the Ulthorks die. It was quite fun to pile up a dozen or so Walrus corpses by the low level people who were fighting what was green to me between 5 of them hehe.<br />
<br />
If you have the patience to clear the walruses out this would be a good place for level 49-52 or so to quad kite. Not quite as much exp as any of the other places mentioned but a refreshing change and they drop some pretty neat Ulthork armour which will sell on auction for a few hundred plat.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
ICECLAD:<br />
<br />
SNOW COUGARS:<br />
Gnome Camp isle (set up outside village at base of hill) or Tower of Frozen Shadow isle (set up around the gnoll huts). Good chance at Cougar Claw Earrings.  Named cougar Midnight likely will spawn (random in any cougar spot), drops quest item.  Rare spawn Garou also may show up near Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Some will be green at 39, just be sure to con before pulling.<br />
<br />
DIRE WOLVES:<br />
Dragon Ring isle (port location).  No special loot. Med on the icebergs off the shore, no wanderers there.  Most will be green by 43.  Lots of giants wandering in the area, so you may want to use harmony to reduce adds.<br />
<br />
DERVISHES:<br />
<br />
From 35 to the end of 38 snow dervishes in Iceclad are excellent quad fodder (experience-wise - loot blows). After you zone in to the iceclad ring go to the shoreline behind the dragon ring. You can safely med about twenty feet up from the waterline (any closer and you risk agro from a dervish that paths through the water near shore.) Nothing wanders down there (only occasional trains) so you can pretty much med unmolested - though I always camo while medding there. To get your group of dervishes, go up the hill and to the left a little toward the building with the dragon skull on top (where some giants spawn), you should be able to get four derves snared as fast as you can cast ensnare and then lead them back down toward the crest of the hill along the shoreline. Kite them up and down the coast. I was still getting 1.5 blue bubbles per quad at 38 there. Now that I am 39, some of them are greening (they are 29-34) but even at 39 I get 1.25 blue bubbs per quad. Drops (rare) are chill daggers and iceballs. Bleh. But good exp :-) <br />

DWARVES in BB<br />
4 at the south shore near the druid ring (you will take a faction hit with the guards on the fisherman, turn in CB belts to fix it). Or the 4 at the docks, they are on a longer spawn time (2 on docks, 2 in buildings). <br />
<br />
<br />
OVERTHERE<br />
<br />
&quot;Went from 37 to 41 in the Overthere quadkiting. First I did the succulents like everyone said but they will stop after they get so low and not all your lightnings hit for full damage so you need to go back and clean up the stragglers. I then discovered Rhinos and Tigresses don't stop. They pursue you until dead. MUCH BETTER to quad these. Although only do rhinos or tigresses as they move at different speeds. I always found more rhinos avaiablable so stuck to those. Melees avoid them because they hit very hard and never back off. These took almost 4 bubbles of mana at 40 with 180 wisdom. Loot sucked so I couldn't always afford clarity.&quot;<br />
<br />
-Gaennen<br />
<br />
&quot;For those of you having trouble with others jumping in while quadding in OT, I've found it's best to pull from the outside walls, and actually kite them closer to the center of the zone. There are much fewer mobs that will jump in and help. <br />
<br />
Also, I had a lot of trouble at 36 killing anything consistently mainly due to partial resists. Now that I've hit 37, I hit for 181 almost all the time, and they stop at the same time most of the time.&quot;<br />

<br />
----<br />
<br />
Bloodgill Summary for you... I have read a lot of posts on the board, and this is how it works best for me.<br />
<br />
1st Step: Find the pillars in Loio, throw on a lev, wolf, and EB... find the Bloodgills. (dont start attacking, just scout it out first) There are 12 Bloodgills Spawns, and 1 Bloodgill Maurader spawn. These are in front or on top of the underwater city. Note the set up. Both the north and the south side of the building has a TOWER and a PLATFORM (with 4 posts) 2 Bloodgills spawn under or around EACH of these spots. These are the &quot;ideal&quot; places to get your pulls. (any of the other requires you to be a risk taker with a REALLY high swimming Skill :)) Head back to the shore and get your spells set up.<br />
<br />
2nd Step: ALWAYS have SLD, Wolf Form and Spikecoat on. Always. Then this is how I have my spells set up. Regen (Cloro), Gate, EB, Lev, Firestrike, Lighting Strike, Burst of Flame (yes the lvl 5 spell), and Ensnare.<br />
<br />
3rd Step: Realize you will get hit. And you may die once or twice before you actually figure this out.<br />
<br />
4th Step: Buff Up. Regen, Levitate, SLD, Wolf Form, Spikecoat, Endurding breath. Then run out over the water and look at the base of the pillars Find a TOWER and a PILLAR that are close together, that both have 2 gobbies swimming at the base.<br />
<br />
5th Step: Swim to the top of the roof, and then edge your way forward till you see one of the goblins. Then go closer till you see the 2nd goblin that is further away and target it. Swim back towards the middle (in between the pillar and the platform) and cast Burst of Flame, pulling the 2 behind you.<br />
<br />
6th Step: Swim. As fast as you can. Head towards the other 2, and once you get in between them shoot straight up. Don't worry you have 4 behind you, you do NOT need to check. (note: if you pull the two under the platform LAST you will have to dodge the bottom of the platform on your way up.)<br />
<br />
Once you surface run towards shore. Count to 4 and turn around. Then watch their heads bob in the water as you run backwards leading them too shore. If you get too far ahead of them they will just pop back to where you pulled them from.<br />
<br />
7th Step: VERY IMPORTANT Mind where you pull your goblins. Remeber when you were level 16 in Oasis and them damn Spectres killed you? Well Bloodgills have a nasty habit of stopping and killing things while they follow you.<br />
<br />
8th Step: run until you think it is safe to cast snare, then run in an OVAL shape around them, until you have snared all 4.<br />
<br />
Nuke away :) They drop pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Its always nice to do an /ooc Please be careful of the goblins! Because some people are just too curious for their own good.<br />

<br />
I spent about 5 levels quadding Bloodgills and I found a strategy that worked great for me. I borrowed a FB earring, so that made things a little easier.  I ALWAYS had Regen, Levitate and any other typical AC/HP druid buffs. Regen, Levitate and EB are the critical ones.<br />
<br />
To Pull...<br />
<br />
1. Head underwater and either pull from the pillars with 2 each, or the floor with 4 scattered spawns. Say we're starting out with the floor spawns for example. <br />
<br />
2. Snare Goblin #1 and swim away with it following. Head to the next goblin and make sure that the first one is far enough behind that you can stop and cast ensnare on the second. Snare #2. By the time you are done casting on #2, the first one should be close. Now swim away circle around or whatever to get a little distance. Head to Gob #3 and ensnare it. Once again, once you get it right, you'lll have all 3 reasonably close. Swim away and then come back and ensnare #4. You can then circle around them a couple times underwater if you like them grouped together, or just head to the surface.<br />
<br />
3. Head to the surface. NOTE: DO NOT SWIM FULL SPEED TO THE SURFACE!! If you do, you will lose them everytime. Swim up a little and pause. Keep doing this until you hit the surface.<br />
<br />
4. Once at the surface, stay there until you can see their heads poke above water. Now, you can run towards the shore. <br />
<br />
5. Run to the shore while stopping and giving the slow moving goblins time to catch up. If you let them get too far away, you will lose them and they will swim back to their home.<br />
<br />
6. Once on shore, you will gather them up tightly and blast away.<br />
<br />
7. For pulling the goblins from the pillars, I started out at 45 with Harmony to ensure I only got 1 at a time. Once you ensnare one, swim to the other pillar and pick up the second one (you did already harmony them didn't you??). Swim back to the first pillar and pick up one.. back to the other for #4. Now head to the surface as described above.<br />
<br />
That's all there is to it!! It may seem like a pain to ensnare them underwater, but if you do you will see that it is MUCH safer to do so. Once in a while you will have a goblin that is hard to stick ensnare on. Just swim away to not let the snared ones close and try again. If all else fails, just swim up and lose them all. No biggie.<br />
<br />
You may also be thinking that it takes too long to get them up top when they are snared. Nah, just locate a place on shore that's close and pull to there.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

Here is method I used successfully to quad kite many many bloodgill goblins. Buff up, put on regen, and levitate. Swim right into the pair at the base of the pillar and agro them - just keep moving. Go to the surface and move to another pillar and pick up second pair the same way. Beat it to shore with levitate (don't out-run them). Snare on shore and process as usual. You can pick up the four singles near the unfinished zone entrance the same way - just watch out for the marauder if he's up. You WILL get stunned on occasion and lose some HP (sometimes a significant amount), BUT I never died doing this for several levels. If no one else is out there you can own the place, especially with clarity. They still only have about 1200 hp - best experience in the game for a solo druid. (And quad kiting them is truly more efficient than killing them singly). As I remember they give exp up to level 50 even tho some will be green by then (and you will get really sick of them before that also). <br />

<br />
----<br />
<br />
Low to mid 40s, the spectres in OOT are _great exp and good money. 4 static spawns, they drop rusty/bronze/regular scythes, just bind at the docks and sell them to the sisters. Clear out the gargoyles, and leave the skeletons up to avoid any further gargoyle spawn (obviously this only works in the off hours, as the gargs are heavily hunted by 20ish types, try to not run them over with the specs)<br />
<br />
-Blackwulf<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
1. Clear gargoyles before quading spectres or they will add (unless your faction with them is high enough and youre not kos - its Mistmoore faction). Skellies wont add.<br />
2. Stay always at limit of &quot;out-of-range&quot; for lightnings : if one spectre come close enough to lifetap, you'll have to regroup them and you'll loose time.<br />
3. Keep chloro on : 4 lifetaps at once and some slashing can hurt you badly...<br />
4. Keep levi on : if things go bad for you, just do the Jesus Christ run : flee over the water.<br />
5. Try to run on &quot;flat&quot; ground : theres a bug with spells range when you're not at the same altitude as mobs.<br />
6. When youre bored with spectres, just take a ride to the oracle's island, and nuke him if he's up (harmony the guardian, hes tough) : the ugly oracle robe sells for about 1k to all casters on my server... But be careful, his nukes are severe. You can also root-dot gornit (the named giant pirate on the seafury island) he drops a lot of plat (about 20pp each time plus FS weapons, sometimes more).<br />
<br />
With all those things in mind, chasing spectres is very cool and great exp. I didnt even die once there. You definitely can do that at 44. Have fun. <br />
<br />
-Jarinya Sinsemilia <br />
<br />

<br />
I started the specs at 45 as well, but I could of started earlier, with 190ish wis, I have a full bubble of mana left over each time.<br />
<br />
If you are lazy, like I am, don't bother clearing the gargs, just pull all the specs to the oracle island (assuming you are not KOS to oracle, and goblins) I wasn't. There is much more flat ground on this island, making it much easier to kite them. It's not far at all, and by the time they get there, they are usually nicely rounded up and ready to go.<br />
<br />
You can also keep your eye out for Wiltin in the pirate camp, his spot spawns at 11AM each morning and he's pretty rare. Drops the quiver for ranger Ivy Greaves. <br />

<br />
----<br />
<br />
Lvl 50-51 - Frost Giant Savages at the fort near GD zone in Eastern Wastes. Mostly never camped on my server (probably since captain is a pain), and its the safest place to quad that I've ever found.<br />
<br />
I had 200WIS at the time, and never had to med-kite.<br />
<br />
The only problem is the captain, who is NOT quaddable (something like 10K hp's). However, you can get rid of him easily, and get the XP for the kill, as follows:<br />
- harmony the 2 savages at the gate (if present)<br />
- aggro captain<br />
- take him up to the coldain camp north of the fort (IMPORTANT: use SoW and not wolfform!)<br />
- ensnare<br />
- let the coldain cooks/hunters pound him till down a third (oh, BTW, make sure nobody is killing the coldain before trying this, or you have a long root/DoT fight ahead of you)<br />
- root him (he'll aggro on the coldain)<br />
- when all the coldain are dead, DoT for the remainder, and collect the XP (make sure all the coldain are dead, or no XP)<br />
<br />
After the captain is dead, there are enough giants at the fort for 2 quads (actually, Flojaren spawns only once per 2 regular spawns, so half the time one quad will have 3 giants only). Timing is pretty much perfect - 2 quads, med, captain spawns for next cycle.<br />
<br />
When the captain pops again, the coldain should be popped and ready to help again :) <br />
<br />
No roamers, so can med in peace by the wall of the fort. Decent, but not great XP.<br />
<br />
The kicker - CoV faction. Was high dubious to CoV when finished with 51, so could safely head to CS to do wyverns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">06-29-2001, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CRAZED GOBLINS in BUTCHERBLOCK<br />
<br />
There is now a new place in the old world, which I consider an ideal place to learn quadkiting at level 34 and 35. It's the crazed goblins in Butcherblock, a new camp in a previously unused valley between the crossroads and Kaladim. Track for &quot;crazed goblins&quot; and you will easily find them.<br />
<br />
PROS: <br />
- The camp consists of exactly 4 crazed goblins<br />
- They are low blue to level 34 and 35 (you'll see the first high green at 36)<br />
- They are far enough from each other to not even need harmony, you can safely ensnare them one by one<br />
- There is nothing else that would aggro on a level 34/35 druid in the vicinity, no adds<br />
- They drop up to 4 PP each, and about half of them drop either FS daggers or small ringmail parts, so you collect good PP as well as XP<br />
- They move at &quot;old world&quot; goblin speed, much slower than cougars<br />
- You can do the quadkiting completely in that side valley, no risk of accidentally kiting the goblins over somebody just passing<br />
- At level 35 with 190 Wis I had more than one bubble of mana left after quadkiting them<br />
- And by the time I medded to FM (without breeze/clarity), they just popped again<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
- The place is so good, it's hard to get the camp at prime time (I had no problems getting it during off-peak hours)<br />
- If somebody insists on &quot;sharing&quot; the camp with you, you can't quadkite any more<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, the crazed goblins have an uncommon drop of a &quot;Blade of Nobility&quot;. This is one of 4 quest items you have to collect to get the new Ghoulbane. Keep one, and when you find another one, shout. Maybe there is a paladin looking for that quest item. After all, we got this nice new camp because Verant introduced this new quest, not because they like quadkiting druids. :) <br />

<br />
1) Do you use luminescent staff and/or ES vambraces or other external method of applying damage?<br />
<br />
ES arms and a complete mana suit (plat tiarra, cone, etc)<br />
<br />
2) Did you have any problems finding enough of the mobs at 55 (my current level) without getting aggro'd by unwanteds?<br />
<br />
At 55 no way, just about everything was blue and it was great. All I did was sperm I believe. At 58 now, a lot of the wurms/wyv's/sperm are green sooo.... some chromos, and bottemless devourers are all great. Can toss a mature wurm or skycinder drake into the mix to dot with arms when the rest die.<br />
<br />
3) When snaring Sky Drakes (ash/fire etc.) wouldn't their casting move them outside your quad kite group? <br />
<br />
Timing's gotta be just right on drakes/chromo's. My qk style has always been to run far enough away to when I clicked the nuke, it would say out of range....then just mass click it till it starts, this ensures you get the most range out of it. Run when the casting box disappears on your screen, don't wait for the server message saying you hit it or it interupted.<br />
<br />
4) What mobs would you recommend to kite (types of mobs...I'm sure I'll only snare the blue ones) :)<br />
<br />
sperm early on, wyverns (just dont get bitten by them, they pack Dark Poison, very nasty), skyash drakes......try to stay away from wurms, wurms in SF are like the ones in BW, too many hp's for thier level and they just aren't efficient as other things.<br />
57 and up, your bread and butter will be soulless devourers and chromos. But if patient and look hard enought, you can find blue feasters, wyv's and whatnot.<br />
<br />
5) (mine) Where to kite?<br />
<br />
I had to toss this in as it became important. North of the BW zone-in is a large volcano. North of that is the large lake. On the south edge of that lake is the best place in the world to kite. Flat, few obstructions and no wanderers. Also its a bit easier to find blues on the north side of the volcano and not many obstacles like the stone tower forest and the boneyard on the south side.<br />
<br />
Be safe and watch that agro range. Use f9 a lot =) <br />

From 35 to the end of 38 snow dervishes in Iceclad are excellent quad fodder (experience-wise - loot blows). After you zone in to the iceclad ring go to the shoreline behind the dragon ring. You can safely med about twenty feet up from the waterline (any closer and you risk agro from a dervish that paths through the water near shore.) Nothing wanders down there (only occasional trains) so you can pretty much med unmolested - though I always camo while medding there. To get your group of dervishes, go up the hill and to the left a little toward the building with the dragon skull on top (where some giants spawn), you should be able to get four derves snared as fast as you can cast ensnare and then lead them back down toward the crest of the hill along the shoreline. Kite them up and down the coast. I was still getting 1.5 blue bubbles per quad at 38 there. Now that I am 39, some of them are greening (they are 29-34) but even at 39 I get 1.25 blue bubbs per quad. Drops (rare) are chill daggers and iceballs. Bleh. But good exp :-) <br />

&quot;Started quading cougars at 35. Can be easily pulled by the tower from a small area toward the Gnolls. There are 3 that spawn under a far out tree, and one wanderer. Only thing you have to watch for are 2 shadow guardians that wander down. You will be safe if you pull them to the shore and wuad along the shoreline. Then hide and med by the gnolls. Repeat for great xp, no competition, and cougar claws that (for any non twinks) will probably will be your first source of significant income. <br />
<br />
After they turn green, move on to dire wolves just ahead past Balix. Pull from and to shore. No loot, but you will get MANY medium dire wolf skins that make people very happy to receive for the dire wolf cloak quest. Few people know about it, but are overjoyed to find a decent cloak so easy to obtain. And the skins are sorta rare-ish. People who know about the quest will spend hours trying to get one.<br />
When they green, specs are where it's at.&quot;<br />

&quot;In BW as you zone in from DL, head slightly NE. There is a clearing due west of the Iksar statue. This area is just SE of the big crater. The trees there are a safe place with no wanderers, and the whole area east of the crater is a nice place to get multiple mobs of any level...usually can find 4 ash's to quad if you feel so inclined. Otherwise lots of giants, apes, skels, sarnaks and hornets to root dot.<br />
<br />
Oh and don't forget if you wanna quad that the hornets, sarnaks, and I believe skels run at the same speed and are therefore amenable to quadding.<br />

Good luck <br />

Levitate and get to the highest spot you can above the nest, float over and land on one of the lobes on the side of the nest. Climb from there to the top. Med on the top of the nest !! no roamers !!<br />
<br />
Also back near the wall past the flat area above the nest is a pretty good spot. The hotwingz never seem to come back as far as the wall, they just move back and forth across that flat plane area above the nest. I have seen Gullerback wander back along the wall there very rarely tho.<br />
