But for 5-mans, it might be more useful.  I haven't officially re-spec'd yet.  As we are short tanks for 5-mans, but woefully short healers for raids.  Dual-specs can't come soon enough for me.<br />

I guess the other 3 (rejuv, swiftmend and regrowth) are far superior than the LB glyph so it is not worth giving up one of the other 3 to try the LB gylph.<br />

For bears there is only one must have glyph (Maul), the rest of them are just sort of nice.  And really you could live without the Maul glyph.  But, for trees they seem to be almost required.</div></div><hr />

I heal in my boomkin glyph's all the time!  Not because of the cost, but because I simply forget to reglyph.  <br />
<br />
The only one I normally miss is &quot;Swiftmend&quot;.  You have to stop using the swiftmend at a whim and use it more as an &quot;Oh Shizz...&quot; button without the glyph.  <br />
<br />
I would agree, Maul is hands down the single most important bear glyph...I would go as far as saying its the most important Druid glyph.  You simply can't account for the uber threat/DPS it generates!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is only one other person in guild that can out DPS my boomkin, but unfortunatley, I am the Main Tank, and our third tank, happens to be the same person as our main healer.  So if I go boomkin, we have to go deep on the bench to fill the tank spot.  All though, with the crit buff and the removal of one of our 1500-DPS melee classes (sore subject), I think we would see a noticable difference in our raid DPS.</div></div><hr />

I think i have above 1700spellpower (in treeform) maybe MAYBE 250 mp5 in combat (unbuffed) my mana pool is something like 14-16K (depending on buffs). Having a replenishment makes a huge difference as well as having Runic Mana potions (more specifically in 10 man runs), you can get away without these things but they help alot in terms of mana consumption. 25 mans are actually alot easier on healers especially (not only are there more of us) but theres alot more buffs and you've almost always got a replenishment (maybe even two depending), I find it near impossible as a healer to run out of mana in a 25 man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">01-08-2009, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly Tlb, you hitting #1 is more about cast choice than gear.  I was #1 in 10 &amp; 25 mans back when I was sitting at about 1400 SP, with 200 MP5 (while casting). 15k+MP is good...but I can't remember where I was sitting when I started.  Crit is negligible, all your crit comes from talents.  I think most Resto's read about 10%-20% on their tooltip.  <br />
<br />
Now I am at ~1950 SP, and 350-400 MP5 (raid buffed).  Obviously I still topped most meters.  But Druids, who HoT the tanks, and then WG/Rejv any splash damage will stomp the heal meter unless you have a holy priest running around spamming Holy Nova.  (in which case you need to have a serious conversation about mana efficiency!  :P)<br />
<br />
Check Wowwiki.com (sorry can't link it atm) for a resto build that takes you deep enough into Balance that you get the int --&gt; MP5 talent + Intensity = unlimited mana!  Ride that sweet wave while you can, cause Blizzard is bound to nerf the junk out of that soon.</div></div><hr />

My in combat MP5 was 225 prior to those upgrades, so I would think it has improved some as well.</div></div><hr />

Keep an eye on Healbot!  Its required me to re-type each modification I make to heals each time I respec!  Not sure if that is just me or not, but always fun to need WG and be clicking away with nothing happening!  <br />

I'm also seeing our druids vastly outheal (on a healing meter) every other healing class, even shamans on Chain Heal duty.  I end up wondering if we have a batch of really bad healers or whether we're just the awesome now.  I end up at doing 45% of the healing, the next highest is in the 20-30's% and down from there.</div></div><hr />

I know how you feel, last night running 3 healers in a nAxx 10 man i did 51% of the healing over-all. At that point i jsut assume that it's a latency issue or maybe they just aren't using the same mods i am, i dunno. This stuff solidifies my GM's opinion that i should just always heal. I also think it has alot to do with our proactive approach to healing (preventing the bar from moving rather then reacting after the fact), we just don't give other healers enough time to avoid overhealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutley!  When druids are MT healing, there generally isn't anywhere for another healer to squeeze in a heal! A full set of HoTs rolling heals somewhere in the 4k-7k per sec.  Obviously this means we are overhealing a lot too, but its much less stressfull for the tank to be overhealed constantly and then not have to hover over his &quot;Oh Shoot&quot; button.  (I know, I do it too much)  <br />
<br />
When I am tanking I will take a druid healer over any other just about everytime.  I know the math works out to Pallies being better healers for MT (and they are good), but theres somthing comforting about knowing that have you 8-15 seconds of heals still coming if the healer is stunned, killed, or otherwise preoccupied!</div></div><hr />

I think part of it may be style.  I go for preemptive healing.  My raid bars light up every time someone is targeted so I cast a heal before I see them even take any damage.  I see other people waiting a lot longer to heal.  For instance, just because I don't see the MT is down much in health, doesn't mean I don't have a heal casting that I can break-off if unneeded (presuming it's regrowth). <br />
<br />
I noticed with our shammy was healing the MT he'd wait until the MT had taken more damage than I would have waited for.<br />
<br />
From one raid (all bosses we did) I did 40% of the healing, 17% overheal.  Priest did 30%/38%.  Shaman did 18%/43%.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am working too hard. :p<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe WG is too good and we're cutting into Shaman territory too much.  I don't really cast it though when I'm MT healing, unless I absolutely have to.</div></div><hr />

Although that shaman is using Grid, maybe he's got a poor configuration.</div></div><hr />
