Perhaps the Tarnished Signet is the easiest to solo. I don't recall if any of them summon, probably do. Some like Dust-Marred Signet, are a pain even with a full group although 75 probably makes it easier.  But basically, I'd say unless you're well geared and AA'd it would be very difficult to impossible to get a lot of them.  Better luck getting  a rot loot from a group.<br />

I spent maybe a 2 hours in that compared to about 40 in the sewers. At least it was decent AA and had some good drops to sell.</div></div><hr />

A couple suggestions/advices -<br />
<br />
[1]  When you get the catacombs instance, get Catacombs C - the instance giver will mention a named Pixxt.  In the spawn room, there's a noc against the wall with a little cubby-like area in the wall.  Kill him in there, park yourself in there and that'll be the only mob you'll agro or have to kill until the Insidious Dragorn spawns.<br />
<br />
[2] For the Sewers, you need Sewers C - again, the instance giver will mention a named Ukun.  Make sure you bring a stack of invis to undead pots with you... you can make it through a lot of the zone invis until you get to the undead murkgliders.  Sewers signet PH is &quot;a twisted stoneworker&quot;.  He's just past the undead murks.  Once you get to him, you'll just have to kill him and one roaming undead murk.<br />
<br />
[3] For Hollows, due to SoE's screwup, you'll have to shroud down to 70 to get the Historian to give you the quest.  Once you have the instance though, you can gate back and unshroud and then go in and slaughter.  I found that the easiest to get was the Fire Pits, but I've also heard the Watering Hole is another easy one.  I was able to invis all the way in to the camp without a single problem in Fire Pits.<br />
<br />
As for time - it took me about 4 hours for Hollows, 2 for Catacombs and 2 for sewers.  It was just kill PH, wait 18 minutes, get ready, kill, rinse + repeat.</div></div><hr />

Easy kills back, but could no longer invis most of the way back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found this to be true in Sewers also.  That one large room full of murks used to hold one or two random see invis; now they all do.</div></div><hr />

If they are flagged undead they now always see invis.  Found this out in Illsalin yesterday after I almost got smooshed by 2 mobs that didn't used to see invis.</div></div><hr />

You no longer need to shroud down.  Did this instance for a few friends this past weekend and we were all 75 and got instance without shrouding.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Catacombs is the only dungeon I've seen that will spawn the named MoB on the first instance. Some may frown on the practice, but its MUCH faster to spawn instances until the named is up.<br />
 <br />
Other than spawning the instance, this guy is soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">11-16-2006, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">iirc you can only do the catacombs trick once every 20 minutes now - ie, you can get a new instance in less time than that, but you won't have a chance at named.  Could still split the group up and get 2 instances for increased chances, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">11-16-2006, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've gotten the named on the second or third try before, without waiting 20 minutes.  I don't remember when, but it was sometime in the last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faellin</div><div class="date">11-16-2006, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We used the same approach as described above just last week.<br />
<br />
 I stayed by the NPC to get the instance. <br />
 The others waited by the zi to the instance. <br />
 I would keep trying until I got the correct instance. <br />
 To speed things I set up a hotkey with 5 lines of /dzremove [playersname] for each person in group and then try for next instance. <br />
 Once we got the correct instance one person would zone in and get close enough to see if Signet mob was up. <br />
 If not, he would zone back out and we rinsed and repeated. <br />
 Using this method we got 4 people the same signet in 2 hours.</div></div><hr />
