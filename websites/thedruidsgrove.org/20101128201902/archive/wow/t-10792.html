I am going feral to level, may change to resto when I get to 60 but we'll see when I get there. What weapon types have the best stats for me to use? Right now I have a two-handed mace with +3 str. I've just been wondering what type of things I should look for at this level. I know there aren't really great items, but I would like to do the best possible for my level. I'll pretty much be solo'ing for the next couple months so I want to be able to fight well by myself. As I get into the 20's, are there any specific armor or weapons that I might try to get that are great for feral?</div></div><hr />

It can be a staff/mace/dagger. Unless if you want to heal you might consider taking INT/SPRT as your primary staff.</div></div><hr />

As to the suggested weapons, those aren't very good for a feral leveling spec from what I can see. The staff is focused too much towards stuff I really wont need and the mace provide no stats at all (sure the shadow bolt isnt bad but I'd prefer stats). I know to focus on strength first, then its a toss up between agility or stamina. I've read quite alot on druid's so I'm not a total noob but I just wanted to see if anyone had any specific weapons they liked to use at this level range.<br />
<br />
Due to being in Iraq currently, I level abit slow since I only get a couple of hours per night to play at most. I got to 14 and now I'm looking at the fact that with my horrible ping (average between 1500 - 3000ms) I am not able to really do groups very well. I'd feel horrible if someone died in an instance because of my connection, so I really am just looking to solo my way to as high as I can get in the next 2-3 months (I leave soon, hopefully). So basically what I'm asking really is if anyone could recommend some good weapons/armor for feral spec'd low level druid (15 - 30 or so?).<br />
<br />
I do appreciate the response lumbergh but I don't think those two weapons would work well with feral spec.</div></div><hr />

Against harder mobs, caster stats are rather important as healing and rooting take mana and are keys to survival.<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapons are a good place to get said caster stats since they are the only thing that can be swaped in combat...<br />
That said the Friar Staff iirc, is blue BOE, and more then likely far more expensive then you want to spend for a first character.<br />
<br />
Level'n up, aslong as you have green gear that's close to your level your doing fine.  Blue items are hard to get if you don't do instances... so look for greens and generally speaking &quot;of the Bear&quot; (str/sta) or &quot;of the Tiger&quot; (str/agil) with a couple of pieces &quot;of the Eagle&quot; (int/sta) for some mana and you can always keep the mana gear bagged for when you need it.</div></div><hr />

For feral you want to have the strength, stamina, agility....but don't forget to add some intellect in there too.  You have to make sure you have enough mana to pop out every now and then so you can heal and then go right back into feral.  Granted when you are in feral form you don't have to worry about mana.....but when you get caught in any sticky situations that extra mana will help.<br />
<br />
I would suggest carrying 2 weapons with you at all times.  Staves tend to have better caster/healer stats and Maces usually have a good combination of Feral and also some Caster/Healer stats.</div></div><hr />
