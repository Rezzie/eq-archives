<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 61 druid, well equiped, 2nd tier enabled. I also have a 52 cleric, fair to poor equipment, no flags, that I want to PL to 56 as fast as possible, (for 96% res, I am forever ensnaring myself with the druid at the worst possible times). Any insight that you can give me would be very much appreciated. <br />
<br />
A little background; I two box with three seperate accounts available, 61 druid, 52 cleric, 60 rogue, all on different accounts. If necesary, I can fire up a laptop and 3 box, but usually only for emergencies, i.e. Cr or difficult res requiring porting and lockpicking. I run a DSL connection at 1.2m, and the puters have 1.8gig and 1.2 gig processors with 512m and 256m ram respectively. Performance issues can become apparent if all three puters are running EQ at teh same time. I need guidance on how to get the cleric from 52 to 56 as quickly as possible, and then how and where to duo the Druid and Cleric for max exp.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and knowledge</div></div><hr />

I used to root my self with my clicky necklace a LOT more than I like to admit.  Good advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ausversucht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've used my cleric extensively in nightmare and disease 2 boxing.  From the moment she dinged 46 til now (54 with 6AA's) she has helped considerably.  I just use her mostly for extra hps and ac buffs also the new PoP spell haste buff is nice too.  She CH's my pet (will fill a blood raven from about 40 percent) as well as stuns it when charm breaks.  I usually keep her top two stuns loaded just for this purpose, and she generally always has my pet targetted.  This is also useful in Kael for when I decide to do some farming with those blasted drakkel dire wolves (keep in mind though that if the wolf sees through invis, it is also unstunnable from my observations).  At 53 I had her at straigt AA for a while and she would get twice as much AA as I did also going straight AA.  The levels also fly by pretty fast and you sometimes find yourself trying things you normally wouldn't solo.  Have fun, a cleric 2nd box is a great asset to a druid.  (The rezzes aren't bad either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TenerinBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Similar post on EQdruids.  Question:  How to PL a lvl 46+ &lt;insert class here&gt; using a lvl 60+ druid?  Answer: Go to any PoP zone where you can charm solo.  Sit PLee down perferably in a safe spot invis'ed.  Charm solo with the PLer.  PLee's main job is to NOT get in the way.  They could just sit down and do absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
For the most part, if you are PL'ing a melee, they should sit down and do nothing as the PoP mobs just hit too hard.  If you are PL'ing a caster, they can contribute.  Clerics are very useful especially with their CH's, buffs and their stuns to aid re-charms (actually a great class to duo with when charm fighting).  Shamans are also useful with their slows, heals, and buffs (good second choice for a class to duo charm fight with).  As long as nukers aren't grabbing aggro, they should be helpful as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Head to PoD or PoN. Group your cleric and druid. Snare, debuf, charm and haste a mob. Run rampant and kill stuff. Cleric Cheals pet (between fights is best to avoid agro). This should take you both to lvl 60+ in a little over a week depending on your play time. <br />
<br />
Druid handles crowd control with root and snare. Learn to keep adds off your pet and save the cleric some mana. Get the cleric a MOUNT as soon as possible. the mana regen is priceless. Cheapest model will do fine. <br />
