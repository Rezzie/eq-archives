<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LSanguine</div><div class="date">11-17-2002, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok now that I'm 59 it's time for me to start taking my Epic quest seriously and get it (and 60) soon.<br />
<br />
I've been soloing all the soloable mobs to get them done, so that only the larger battles are left.<br />
<br />
The only soloable mob I have left to do is the Barracuda in LOIO. I've got a 60SK that's able to help anytime, so I'm not at all worried about the actual fight, I'm just having a hell of a time tring to pop the Tainted (let alone the Corrupted).<br />
<br />
All the walkthroughs I've seen state that it pops at neg900, neg900, based on Deepwater Barracuda PHs. So we went there, the SK sat there, I went around killing a bunch of Deepwater Barracudas for ages and we had no pop. <br />
<br />
I eventually tracked down the spot where they were spawning (neg300, pos250 or something like that, should have written it down). The Sk then proceeded to kill a barracuda about every minute, as they spawned and respawned. This went on for over an hour, till I logged to check some more walkthroughs.<br />
<br />
Walkthroughs (inc the one linked from the top sticky here) were pretty adamant about it being neg900 neg900, so we went back there, and killed 2 barracudas that happened to be in the area. Then we waited. Waited some more. SK waited there while I went around killing the barracudas from oldest spawn to newest, and we were back where we started from = nowhere. :mad: <br />
<br />
So, just wondering what other people's experiences with this elusive evil fish have been.. anyone here had it pop at the neg900 neg900 spot? The PH are Deepwater ones, not Bloodgill ones, right? Any other ideas at all would be most welcome.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

Killing other baracudas than the one at the loc u mentioned, can pop a tainted, but those tainted will not spawn the corupted. <br />
<br />
The one u need to kill is as u already mentioned at loc N 900 N 900. Its on a 20 minute spawn as far as i remember so be prepared to some waiting for respawn. If u dont see a baracuda at this loc, it has already been killed, or maybe u are sitting at its spawn place, this might prevent it from spawning. So try move a bit.<br />
<br />
The tainted, has a larger agro range that the normal baracudas, so just be ready if u sit to close. Anyway he is a fairly easy solo kill, snare him and get him up on land. He is a fast swimmer, so get him up where u have the advantage hehe :)</div></div><hr />

Monk helped me off the tainted as well as the following corrupted)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">11-19-2002, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Placeholder is sort of near neg 900, neg 900, but not exactly.  There's a single underwater pillar in that area, and the spawn is southeast of that, just out of view (or possibly south, and in view?  I've seen it both ways, I think).  Spawn time seems to be 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
If, for some reason, you're one of those people who put off the epic for a long time and happened to get dire charm first (like me)...you can dire charm a bloodgill barracuda (higher level than the deepwater barracudas), give it a pair of one-handed weapons and plant it at the spawn point.  It will happily munch through placeholders unassisted, and with savage spirit and maybe a few heals it has no trouble killing the tainted/corrupted.<br />
<br />
Dire charm also makes the corrupted seahorse in kedge soloable (along with every other mob in the zone besides Phinigel), by the way. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just Kedge, Fay, VSR and a Jade Reaver to go now.. only part that worries me is VSR.. time to go and read up on it...<br />
<br />
If -only- I had DC.. but not put off the epic quite that long ;) <br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

The Jade Reaver can be a bit peculiar though. If you can buy one, I suggest just doing that. When I finally got my own reaver it was after I had seen over 100 Black Reavers dead. And then the one that popped over that one also dropped one.<br />
<br />
I've had some mad luck in EQ but this one thing really stopped me in my tracks.<br />
<br />
Oh and.. Hi ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LSanguine</div><div class="date">11-24-2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might get your help on VSR then, Shalrath ;) <br />
<br />
Especially since I have no idea (yeah yeah) <br />
I might leave the &quot;Farma&quot; at home though :p <br />
<br />
I'd rather try CoM a time or two first, since I can likely get the 1-group of numbers together more easily than the 20-25k to buy one. After I'm horribly frustrated I'll look in bazaar... also if it gets to last piece shortly.<br />
<br />
Will be going fishing again this evening most likely.. wish me luck.<br />
