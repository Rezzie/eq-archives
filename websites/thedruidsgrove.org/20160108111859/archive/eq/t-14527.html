I've gotten myself geared up and have started leveling and finishing my epic (stopped half way through back in 2003).  I've been in Cobalt Scar until now (54) but exp is getting slow.  I tried charm kiting in Plane of Disease, but the charm was breaking off too much for it to be effective.  So my question: where should I go that I could level up at a decent pace solo?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Suggestions for 54...<br />
<br />
Hot zones:<br />
Karnor's Castle for 55.<br />
* Veksar for 60.<br />
* Veksar is an indoor zones.  So harmony of nature won't work.  I've never been there so I'm not sure of kiting room either.<br />
<br />
Charming...<br />
If you are not using the lvl 53 spell Glamour of Tunare (magic debuff), then I would suggest snaring and using that spell first before charming.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I did level 54-59 in Plane of Nightmare charming the Nighstalkers.  <br />
<br />
PoDisease - Charm rats, kill Testian flies.<br />
PoNightmare - Nightstalker camp <br />
<br />
Root / Dotting...<br />
<br />
Velketor's Labyrinth - Spiders. <br />
The Maidens eye - old Luclin zone might be on low side for exp.  Non-the-less mobs are around your range.  Gorganas range from lvl 45-57.<br />
Plane of Mischief - most trash are in low 50's<br />
PoJustice - Gaoler of Justice (lvl 50), Guardian of Justice (56).  Faction here didn't seem to much of an issue for adds.<br />
PoNightmare - Trees / spiders / bats<br />
Dranik's Scar (OoW) - Murkgliders have nasty dots, but moved fairly slow.<br />
The Broodlands (DoN) - Not sure what to hunt, but Alla's list have mobs from low 40's to mid 50's.<br />
Corathus Creep (DoDH) - I never tried it, but level of mobs are appropriate and may prove to be better exp than PoP zones as it's a newer expansion.  Try for the sporalis.<br />
<br />
Groups in any of the tier 1 PoP zones was always good when I got them.  At level 55 you gain access to Plane of Storms and Valor where again grouping there would be better than teir 1.<br />
<br />
Oh - and when you get lvl 55, invest in a pair of these if you can: Wanderer's Sylvan Leggings (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17241).  Clicky root is a good thing!  I still use mine at lvl 71.<br />
<br />
GL to you Tuuvan!</div></div><hr />
