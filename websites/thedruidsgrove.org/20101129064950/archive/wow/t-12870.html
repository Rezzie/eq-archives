That's the biggest rating change i've ever seen (gain or loss) and it tells me that we really should have lost to that team...<br />
<br />
The biggest rating loss I ever saw was 21. I've actually seen that a couple times and think to myself &quot;how bad IS this team that they got a 21 point rating change from MY team (back when my 2's team was sub 1400)</div></div><hr />

Best part was, the team was from our server.  I /w them 'Good game' and they didn't respond very nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But now he's in New Zealand and gets really crappy ping :&lt;  So no more arena for us..<br />

Granted my 2v2 team sucks and we can't break through the 1900 barrier, but I keep raking my my measly points each week...<br />
<br />
I have never tried to arena on my druid yet, I only do it with my lock and a roguelette friend.  We may do better with my being able to throw out some heals now and not relying on band aids and health stones.</div></div><hr />
