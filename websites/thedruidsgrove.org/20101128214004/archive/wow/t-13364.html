mmmkkkk, so I am confused.   &quot;Ulduar staff pawns&quot;, but you put it away when you are in the toughest encounters???  I put my &quot;best&quot; gear on when in the toughest encounters.  <br />
<br />
Ulduar = DPS/TPS Gear.  Naxx = Mitigation/survival gear.  You can make the avoidance argument, but the avoidance doesn't scale nearly aswell as the mitigation tools of the naxx items.</div></div><hr />

I would strongly reccomend that you use your Polar set for &quot;Special Situations&quot; and keep your tier gear mostly Agi gemmed.  Stam gemming your Tier leaves you with a stam set (polar) and a sorta stam set (Tier).  If you gem for agi, you will have an Avoidance/Mitigation (tier) set and a EH set (polar).<br />
<br />
Even with out any stam gems, a bear has slightly higher EH than a warrior/pally or Dk.  <br />

That is my biggest beef with ulduar...there is very little in the way of upgrade for bears in T7.5 gear.  There are a few nice trinkets, but other than that you are simply trading tanking stats for DPS stats.  I already pull 1.8-2k DPS consistenly in bear while tanking, so for me to sacrifice any more tanking stats is silly.  I have a pair of ulduar boots that no one wanted from ignis that are still sitting in my bags unenchanted...not sure what to do with.</div></div><hr />

The better my crit, the better chance my rip crits, right?The changes to ArPen in 3.1 made DPS gear selection more complicated.  ArPen improves white damage, shred damage and makes for a more &quot;consistent&quot; DPS rotation (fewer crit spikes and/or wasted CP).  Crit helps all DPS (except Rake) but now it helps us with Rip as well.<br />
<br />
So, does the increase in white and shred damage make up for the loss in crit?  That is tough to determine, I think.  I'm sure the EJ folks would say otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tunat</div><div class="date">05-13-2009, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only polar bear item i use now is the belt, but i want to upgrade it to the tradeskilled one.   I find our t8 is a solid upgrade over t7 even 10man tier 8.<br />
<br />
With frenzy regen and our last stand i find sta better than avoidance.   In BC i was avoidance but so far in wotlk i think hp is the way to go.    30% heal every 3mins AND 20% more healing on you, and last stand every 3mins for 20seconds (28 with 4set bonus) i dont' see the reason gemming for agi rather than sta. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your polar bear gear though, throwing those 3 on allows you to solo tank hodir no need for a tank switch. This frees up a few slots for extra dps and hodir has i think 30million life if i remember right so every dps counts, although enrage timer gives you plenty time unless you are going for hard mode.<br />
<br />
Quick edit.   Gemming for STA in places where i used to use polar bear gear i gained some tps, some avoidance and other stats and i didn't lose out on too much hp.    Best part of it was i finally got out of polar bear gear.</div></div><hr />

I hate the thought of trading my avoidance and TPS stats for pure STAM.<br />
My sockets are all filled with STAM, but only in normal gear.<br />
We have enough health without this set.<br />
<br />
And i would not go all agility in sockets. It's just not worth the benefit IMO. I'm at around 45%+ dodge in raid. <br />
And the armor from agility is really not that much.<br />
I can compensate this with ease when speccing for &quot;feral aggression&quot; which gives me ~5% damage-reduction from melee-bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">05-14-2009, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a bear you really need two sets of gear.  If you are tanking ads, trash, or soft hitting bosses, you are a burden on a healer and DPS wearing &quot;Stam&quot; gear.  <br />
<br />
I know its hard to do, but run WWS or somthing like that in your Stam gear and compare it to your Agi gear.  I cannot post guild WWS reports (guild policy) but I promise gemming for stam is gimping your tanking.  If you are entry level naxx, by all means, strap on a polar set.  If you are stepping into ulduar you better have much better mitigation/avoidance/TPS than a stam set can provide.  <br />
<br />
I am not saying you need 100% agi gems/enchants, but I am saying you definatley don't want 100% stam gems/enchants.  Error on the side of agility.</div></div><hr />

If i look at Steelbreaker in the Iron Council 25 i have an avoidance of 60% with my set socketed for STAM. I dont think this is all that bad.<br />
<br />
And about the &quot;burden on a healer&quot; thing:<br />
Did u ever notice the overheal we are getting?<br />
It doesnt matter for the healers if they need to heal 35k HP or 50k HP.<br />
<br />
And what boss in ulduar is a soft-hitter?</div></div><hr />
