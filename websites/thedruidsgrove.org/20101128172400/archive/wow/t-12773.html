<br />
There's a raging debate in my guild whether warrior tanks should be passively uncrushable in Kara---&gt;ZA level content. The &quot;debate&quot; has gotten pretty heated recently (to the point that someone /gquit), and I don't have a definitive answer. Some say passive uncrushability takes too much away from other stats for not-so-much mitigation; others say at this level you really can't effectively tank without it (but our bear tanks are doing fine).<br />
<br />
So, does anybody out there play a warrior and have a definitive answer to share with me? Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">08-12-2008, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, a warrior SHOULD only be uncrushable with shield block up.  <br />
<br />
Asking them to be uncrushable otherwise does take away too much from other stats ( mainly stam/ survivability ).  <br />
<br />
<br />
Crushing blows are the first thing after critical strikes to be removed from the hit table if your avoidance is high enough. In particular, if the entire hit table is filled with parry, dodge, block, and miss, you cannot be crushed.<br />
Protection warriors may take advantage of this fact by using their ability: shield block.<br />
<br />
Shield block increases a warrior&#8217;s chance to block by 75%. Therefore, the remaining 25% of the hit table must then be filled by other sources of avoidance. However, remember that bosses are 3 levels higher than you, or what your character sheet shows. They negate 0.6% of your dodge, parry, miss, and block (0.2% of each per level difference). This requires a warrior to have 27.4% avoidance from other sources in order to become uncrushable.<br />
<br />
This 27.4% is actually achieved by a naked protection warrior who puts 5 points into shield specialization (5% to shield block), 5 points in deflection (5% to parry) and 5 talent points into anticipation (20 defense).<br />

But then again, anyone arguing and getting upset enough to guild quit over this topic is pretty stupid. Especially since wow is months away from wotlk, where indications are strong that roles for all the &quot;tanking&quot; classes will change drastically. I'm not sure blizzard will really follow through with what they are claiming now, that in wotlk all four tanking specs will be able to tank as well as another, and there will be no &quot;XYZ class required to progress&quot; (although they say that some classes will still be stronger than others for certain situations). But if they actually do what they are claiming, perhaps this game will really be able to take a big step forward in class balancing. Then all those warriors that claim they have a &quot;right&quot; to be the best tank can either re-roll or accept that they are just another class of many that can fulfill the same role. <br />
<br />
Here's a good thread from the beta forums, full of posts from doom-and-gloom warriors who still can't grasp that other classes might be able to tank as well as them in the expansion:<br />

That made my day.  Listening to warriors bitch using the phrase, removing Crushing blows made Druid tanks automatically the best physical tanks in the game made my day.... <br />
<br />
I didn't think I'd ever hear a warrior say those words...  Of course I'm biased and think druid tanks are better too, but our threat generation currently SUCKS... I think druids are currently planned to be the best at critting and dodging... beyond that I think we need a lot of tank tuning.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
....you are talking about druid tanks having issues with threat and needing tuning??<br />
 <br />
Other than that, to the OP check out tankspot.com for warrior stuffs. Great site.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, since when do druid tanks have crappy threat?<br />
I generate more threat than any other tank in my guild, and in fact pretty much any other tank I have even seen.  I run an up-to-date omen and usually clock myself at around 1200 TPS, very rarely lower than 800, and the highest I've seen was on Void Reaver when I averaged 1800 and peaked at well over 2000.<br />
<br />
By comparison most warrior tanks I've seen generate around 700 threat per sec, with the good ones able to push 1000.  I'm not seeing how bear tanks have aggro issues..?<br />

In the BETA threat generation sucks.  In our current incarnation we are just great for TPS generation.  I was using my statement in reference to Falloraan since his link was to the beta forums.  My bad for not being more specific.  I LUV my druid tankiness.</div></div><hr />

There is no way to be passive uncrushable.  I just cant see the stats happening. If we were i think we would be un hit able as well and that equals no rage. which equals no threat.</div></div><hr />
