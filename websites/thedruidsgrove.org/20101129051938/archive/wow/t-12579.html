<br />
I'm not really enjoying this because it means basically means that feral druids are just going to become toast against hunters.  I mean even locks fear has a cast time.  I'm just not enjoying the idea that not only do I have to worry about traps/stuns/poisons/dispells and the like from hunters, they can run up and fear me instantly.  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this?  Am I worrying needlessly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, this change is f'ing ridiculous.  Hunters are just annoying right now.  I am still amazed at the change to allow arcane shot to dispel.  I mean, ok, give them a dispelling shot, but don't just add it on to a shot they already use in their normal DPS rotation.  At least make them burn a GCD for it.  And, for no apparent reason either, they decided to add on Mortal Strike to Aimed Shot.  WTF is that.  Oh, and there is no dead zone anymore either.  Thats nice.<br />
<br />
... and now insta scare beast.  makes no sense at all.  shamans are pissed too.  Just got insta ghost wolf, and now its a liability against huntards.  the only escape mechanism for resto druids is now a liability as well.  And ferals were just rendered useless.  Like you said, even warlocks have a cast time on fear.  The only thing that could balance this change somewhat would be putting a 3-5 min cooldown on using it.<br />
<br />
One of the things that is killing WoW PvP imo is the incredible amount of mechanisms which make a player completley lose control of their character for a short period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is that I can understand they're trying to nerf resto druids because people cry all the time about them but the more they try to do that the more it's just becoming ridiculous what they're doing to balance/ferals.  It doesn't even cost a good deal of mana to scare beast.  75 mana at rank 3.  -_-  <br />
<br />
I understand that they're trying to buff hunters for arena but...it's just ridiculous because it makes hunters so OP in battlegrounds I think.  I mean seriously, their pets have more HP than they do sometimes, hibernate barely works half the time.  And yeah, no dead zone now is just awesome.  -_-<br />
<br />
Trinket aside then you're vulnerable to their ice block, or anyone else's CCs.  But you have a point, I think the amount of CCs in the game are just becoming irritating.  I understand casters needing them but ugh, I'm sorry, the last thing hunters really need is CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And ya gotta love hunters that have scorpids stacking on 5x poisons on top of viper sting, along with the talent that makes their stings have a chance to resist dispel.  <br />
<br />
Really hunters don't need more buffs for arenas.  Disc priest + hunter or Resto druid + hunter is really strong in 2's right now, Hunter Warrior Druid is really strong in 3's, and Hunters fit in 5's teams well.  I hate how Blizz has no idea how to give classes new talents, so they are giving other classes talents to everyone.  So many classes now have dispels and MS's its ridiculous.  Another annoying change by blizz is giving pallies the ability to fear warlocks pets.  Think of something new ffs.<br />
<br />
They already nerfed resto druids prety hard with the removing movement speed from the set bonus.  They are much easier to contain now.  Balance and feral continue to get more and more screwed in arenas...  Then again, Warlocks are now more or less forced to spec SLSL, Warriors are forced to spec arms Mortal Strike, Mages deep frost Water Elemental etc... When arenas started, diversity was prevalent, though not so much anymore.</div></div><hr />

I mean seriously, next they'll tell us that they're going to nerf our shred/mangle because we have UBER OP Tiger's FURY SELF BUFF!</div></div><hr />

This isn't as big a nerf as it appears.  Don't forget fear has a very high chance to be broken by direct damage.  With warlocks and priests (the other main fearers) it seems unbreakable because they are mainly just dotting you.<br />
A hunter, on the other hand, uses almost nothing except direct damage attacks.  So it's not like you're going to be feared for the full 10 sec and just get owned during that time.  If the hunter is dumb enough to shoot the CC'd druid, that druid will just turn around and disembowel him.<br />
<br />
Don't QQ druids :&gt;  Bring it on !!  Nerf me more Blizzard, I dare you.  I will still destroy all and take names.<br />
<br />
Just watch me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">05-09-2008, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I certainly appreciate Annikk's fierce bring-it-on attitude, it doesn't change the fact that they basically started slapping ferals in the face with the resto &quot;balancing&quot; their doing. For me it isn't so much this one change, but coupled with our Cyclone nerf. I mean we lose 20 yards, still have a casting time, and the target can't be damaged. Hunters can now instantly fear a druid from 30 yards away! I basically shelved Vika for a bit I was so disenchanted. I really levelled up to 70 to be a Feral PvP druid. Because it seemed fun. I was shocked to find that Blizzard really had no devs interested in making feral a viable PvP build. I got all this damn gear with honor grrrr. I wish I'd taken Resto gear. And I don't even want to be a healer.<br />
<br />
And don't forget that resto druids while not in a form can Hibernate us. I really don't think scare beast or hibernate should work on Druids. We should not be &quot;beasts&quot;. Scare beast and hibernate are for PvE and Pets. It's ridiculous that there are spells in the game to screw feral specced druids specifically. And no I wouldn't complain about them if it wasn't such a rare thing to see a highly rated druid in Arena.<br />
<br />
It's just one problem after another. The melee bug where you can't get the proper positioning. Itemization is so whacked for Ferals that even Deep changed to a hybrid Balance / Resto spec. What's the world coming to? :crazy:</div></div><hr />
