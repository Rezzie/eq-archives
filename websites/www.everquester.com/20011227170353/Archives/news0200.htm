        <p><font size="-1">It has been a while since our last update. In that 

          time, KEG has defeated Cazic Thule four times, Vox once, and Nagafen 

          once (maybe twice). The Plane of Sky still daunts us. As a side note, 

          Cazic thule now hits for around 400 points of damage per swing. </font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">The Sky Plane Quest petition had some positive results. 

          Our server GM on The Rathe will now witness a Sky quest being completed. 

          I am unsure about the other servers, but hopefully their policy is now 

          the same. <b>NOTE:</b> Some of the Sky quests have changed. In particular, 

          there was a typo in the original Warrior Test of Skill. The NPC used 

          to ask for a Tiny Ruby, when actually the &quot;code&quot; was looking 

          for a Small Ruby. Other quests may have changed as well. I would not 

          recommend using spoiler sites to determine what you need for your quest 

          as they may contain dated information. Make sure you have the information 

          firsthand from the NPC before trying to complete the quest.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">There is a secret cabal of warriors on the Rathe that 

          have discovered beginning of the Fiery Avenger Quest. More on this, 

          I cannot divulge. However, paladins be forewarned that a warrior may 

          be the first to obtain the fabled sword.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Rumor has it that the depths of Runnyeye are being 

          upgraded to compensate for the increase in higher level players.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">A small format change: I will now be posting current 

          news in a slightly larger font size than older news. This is a bit easier 

          on the eyes.</font></p>

We, the paying customers of Everquest, have an issue that requires 

the full attention of Verant.  We request that you fix the Sky Plane 

Quests.  They are still broken. 



Specifically, the Warrior Test of Skill is broken.  If you review 

your bug logs, you should find a number of other broken Sky quests. 



Furthermore, we request that you allow GMs to witness the 

completetion of these quests until it is confirmed, beyond a shadow 

of a doubt, that all of the quests are fixed.  There is no excuse for 

delivering an incomplete, typographically errored, buggy series of 

quests to your customers.  These quests require the combined efforts 

of many dedicated groups to procure the quest items.  Extending your 

paying customers the courtesy of having a GM witness the completion 

of the Quest, is the least you can do.



Playing for hours on-end to obtain quest items, only to have the quest 

ruined by poor programming and lack of care by the GMs is a slap in the 

face to your dedicated subscribers.  Verant found the time to remove 

levitation and add new portals to the zone.  Verant should be able to 

find the time to repair their flawed quests.</textarea>

        <p><font size="-1">Attention Keggers: we will be having a tactics session 

          on Thursday, February 10th in Permafrost. This session will be designed 

          to hone the skills of some of our newer members, and push our groups 

          to the limit in terms of what we can handle. The session will be held 

          in the pit traps beneath Lady Vox's lair. If this challenge proves too 

          easy (depending on how many show up), we will move the session to a 

          more dangerous environment. Please use the sign up in the members section 

          to verify your attendance. </font> </p>
