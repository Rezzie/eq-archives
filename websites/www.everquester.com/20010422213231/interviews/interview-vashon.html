      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font>Is it easy being green?
          
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Its much easier then dressing up  as Mr. Hanky, agree?
      
      <p class="keg">    
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Well I'd have to talk to Lewick...anyhow...<p class="keg">

      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> I realize you can twist a lot of songs, 
      but can you sing &quot;I'm too sexy&quot; word for word?

      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Sorry, no I can't sing that god 
          awful song. Maybe longan can sing that one.
          
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Bah I keep trying to teach you the words but you don't listen.
     
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> What keeps you logging into EverQuest?
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> My friends I have made in EQ. If 
          not for them I might have never made it this far.
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> How long have you been playing EverQuest?
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> I started playing on E'ci (no figure) 
          on day one of release. After a few months there I moved to The Rathe 
          where I had some RL friends playing.
          
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Do you consider yourself addicted 
          to EverCrack?
          
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Hmm, I am not addicted to the game 
      as much as I am addicted to chatting with friends.
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> In denial eh? Me too!
      
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font>
      What do you think of the mage air pet in sky and why? (the chick one)
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> I heard she gives good cyber. Didn't you tell me that Mareth?
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Erm...ya. Forget I asked.
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Whats one question you would have for me?
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Have you seen Tiwin and his turtle 
          lately?
          
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Only in my dreams man, only in my dreams.
      
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Briefly describe Vashon.
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> What is to explain? I am a level 
      60 wood elf bard. I have lots of friends in guild and out of guild.
      
      <p class="keg">
      <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Well the RP aspect ya know. What 
          ph4t l3wt does he got? What turns his crank? Does he like cybering SLR's? 
          (Doesn't everyone?) Anyhow nm.
      
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> 
          Do you laugh when you see a level 3 die screaming to an orc pawn or 
          do you try and help him win the day?
          
      <p class="keg">
          <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> I usually kill it off for them 
          and then laugh as they still keep running.
          
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> 
          Do you laugh when you see Yukitaro die screaming to a large train or 
          do you try and help him win the day?
          
      <p class="keg">
          <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> I usually let him kill himself 
          and then save the day or zone. What fun would saving him from death 
          be?
          
        <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> 
          Do you laugh when you see Soldierboy die screaming?<p class="keg">
        
        <p class="keg">  
            <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> I usually wave by just before he 
          dies and then give him the finger. After that I take off.
      
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Whats the largest train you've 
          ever pulled?
          
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Hmm lewick would remember this 
          one. At one point I was pulling someones corpse in WW and I had like 
          20 - 30 dogs/drakes/wurms/dragons chasing me. Was kinda funny.
      
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Well I spose that *would* qualify 
          you for KEG. On the yuki scale thats kinda tame tho because more than 
          20 people didn't die screaming.
      
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Ever fall off the cliff going up 
          to highpass?
          
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Fall off? No. Jump off on with 
          DA on? Yes - had to say I have did it before.
      
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Why is it only me that's fallen 
          off that @#$@# pass multiple times?
          
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Cause yer a tool?
          
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> WTH? I'm the one asking the questions 
          here @#$@#! Thats it, this interview is over!
          
          <p class="keg">
          <font color="#990000">Vashon:</font> Good, now get yer fuzzy butt outta 
          my face, I got work to do...</font>

        <p class="keg">This concludes the first KEG interview. Stay tuned for more in the future!</font>
