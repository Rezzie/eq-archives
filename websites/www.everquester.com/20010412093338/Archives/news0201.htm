It would seem that           Snaggle Toof has some issues with my spelling and formatting abilities.           Well to him a big Smigg Smagg, I run the show here now bub. If you want           to fight for it meet me behind the school gym in the arena after school.           I'll strike you down like I did Mareth last night. Yes, Mareth challenged           me and I showed him a lesson. On to the news. Today we have good news           and bad news from KEG ginews. Good or Bad first? Let's go with the bad.           </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It has been reported           here at the KEG WHQ that long time friend and lover Saxiff is &quot;hanging           up his spurs&quot; as he terms it and leaving the land of EQ. He was           and is still a good friend to all of us who know him. It's hard to imagine           the day we met chasing firebeetles through the lands. He has decided           that the &quot;real world&quot;(not the tv show) is more important these           days than a game. Can't blame him can we? Verant has yet to answer my           petitions to have an ice rink installed in Everfrost for EQ Hockey.           This is most likely what led to Saxiff leaving. I kid, but I love. Saxiff           we will miss you, don't be a stranger guy! MARIO!!!!</font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now for the good           news to cheer you all up.

All that's left now is to finish off Zordak           and another completed Epic.

I was off working on a top           secret project to unveiled soon. Now to deal with Snaggle and these           reports comming in of my not running the show. I assure you this is           not true. Don't mind the ogre behind the curtain. I am the man. My spelling           is pinpoint accurate unless the underpants gnomes edit and destroy my           text. There, it's out. I've babbled on long enough.

I will try not to make this           too long. With all the real life events that have transpired lately           to EQ'rs, both KEG members and others, I got to thinking how much time           I have invested into this game. Yes, remember when EQ was a game? Somewhere           along the way it went from a game we played for fun to rushing home           to login and say hi to your friends. Somewhere it turned from characters           too real people. </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The barb can still           remember the first day he logged into EQ. It was an April afternoon           just after release. Silentone, now of Deus Factum, talked me into buying           EQ. I was skeptical at first. We started out on Innoruuk with Sylvaen           joining us. An old mud friend told us to go to The Rathe and join him.           So we did. Things have not been the same since. One day Silentone was           ogling a Flowing Black Robe, remember when those were uber? So I went           up to a stranger by the name of Selayai. We hit it off and he became           our first EQ friend. He no longer plays but I still think about him,           wonder how he's doing. I later met Snaggle and Mareth who are 2 of my           best EQ friends, and from there everyone else I know. </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I do not login           to play anymore, I login to have fun with people I have never met in           real-life . ... people I call "friends". When they leave EQ its the           closest thing to real world death in a way. Sappy? Yes. Weird? Yes,           very much so. I'm prolly the only one who thinks this way, but its my           news section (<i>editors note: so long as he learns to use paragraph           breaks</i>) . . . so suffer. In approximately 20 days I will be heading           to Las Vegas to meet some of these people. It feels weird, honestly,           but I think it will be fun. </font></p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To wrap this nonsense           up I guess what I'm trying to say is when EQ has long since passed and           the new fad of the day comes, or we're all off having lives and families,           I will still be thinking about the "good ole days". I hope to keep in           touch with everyone past, present, and future. And as bad as EQ is or           has become to some people, just sit back and think to yourselves how           lucky you are to have real life imaginary friends to slay with.<br>          <br>          Point is: I love you guys!$!@ </font></p>        <blockquote>           <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><img src="../graphics/khistrich/khis2.gif" width="65" height="59">             Khistrich The Barb </font></p>        </blockquote>        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><u><b>February           22nd, 2001 08:45am</b></u></font>        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>          </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Hey all,           Barb here for another big update. Lots of goodness in the land of Norrath.           Thanks to Verant mucking up the patch once again there was not 1, not           2, but 3 Venril Sathir spawns and we here at KEG were able to get 2           of them. What kind of ph4t l3wts did we get? Acquired from his being           on the first kill was a pair of Cobalt Greaves. Yes, These handsome           pair of warrior leggings were sent to Deemoness and Rixus. Grats! Also           obtained was a Gnarled Staff and 2 Stones. The staff went to Wizzar,           1 stone went to Qualinos, and the 2nd is TBD I believe. Email me if           I am wrong. Onto the 2nd killing, where we ganked(I'm so hardcore!)           some Donal's Greaves of Mourning, and Blood Ember Greaves. I have not           yet been informed as to who will be doning the Donal's(that so rhymes),           the Blood Ember however was given to the guild Noble Blade for them           to hand out. As usual a wizard staff and 2 stones were also gotten.           Staff to Noble Blade, Stone 1 to Larss and stone 2 to Noble Blade.

I have been instilled with the task of updating the news section         and here is the first update. I will try not to make it too long. A lot         has happened since the last. So much so that I will not update it all.         A long overdue grats to Faldor on his Rogue BP and Grondin on his Pal         BP. Also since the last update and very recently (like 3 days ago), Team         Bristlebane's Disciples made the finals of the ToT2 tournament held in         the arena. The team consisted of, (and in no paticular order), General         Fitz, Rendition, Kathrynn, Leahcim, Sanctume, Vashon, and Krieger. They         were defeated by Team Powerfire, a group made of those Evil <a href="http://www.drow.org" target="_top"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">BoTS</font></a>         types. They did us proud! Furthermore congrats on several players getting         lvls. Today is also Patch day, a large one at that. It seems verant is         trying to make up for 2 years of nothing.
