            Quick Summary</u></b><br>
            Anarchy Online is a game with great potential that suffers from awful 
            playability, poor planning, and lack of foresight on the part of the 
            game creators. The game has nice graphics and a decent user-interface. 
            It is easy to start a game session and stop a game sessions.</font> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Playability</u></b><br>
              In its current state the game is almost entirely unplayable. Killing 
              one monster will sometimes take as much as 3 hours of constantly 
              relogging into a crashing game. &quot;Zoning&quot; or moving from 
              one area to another works about 20% of the time. 40% of the time 
              the game will crash when zoning. 40% of the time you will receive 
              a message that says the server was unable to load your zone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This game suffers 
              from time-warps, albeit tiny ones, every time it crashes (which 
              is about every 15 minutes). Visibility is poor, and newbies have 
              no way to easily afford &quot;night vision&quot; goggles, which 
              means expect 50% your first 12 game hours to be stumbling around 
              in the dark (that is, when you can log in). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Skinny players 
              are at a disadvantage as they can get stuck behind machinery and 
              trapped in walls. Make sure to choose a class that can easily kill 
              itself to escape these pitfalls. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One playability 
              advantage to AO is, unlike EverQuest, you can load a game, run a 
              mission, get phat lewt, exp and retire to your apartment all within 
              a 45 minute span. You do not have to spend 3 hours wandering from 
              zone to zone searching for players to make a group. The game seems 
              designed to be very playable solo. Grouping will advance you faster, 
              but solo play is not near-impossible, like in EQ. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also, you can 
              sit down and basically &quot;save&quot; your game in the middle 
              of a mission.l When you log back in, you can pick up where you left 
              off. Unlike EQ, you don't have to worry about having to log back 
              in to an area where you will die and have to spend hours on CR. 
              Which brings up another plus . . .</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Corpse recovery 
              is also done well. Basically you bind at &quot;Insurance terminals&quot; 
              When you die, you are &quot;reconstructed&quot; at an insurance 
              terminal. You collect your &quot;corpse&quot; from a nearby reclamation 
              booth. This ends hours of aimlessly wandering a zone shouting &quot;Has 
              anyone seen my corpse?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A final playability 
              plus is the character development system. The character development 
              is far superior to EQ or Ultima Online. Allowing chracaters of same 
              race/class/level to have widely different skills. Each time you 
              reach a new level, you spend development points on certain skills. 
              The skill costs are weighted by race and class. Character advancement 
              is very similar to many popular table-top RPG systems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Planning</u></b><br>
              Last night someone said &quot;The person who thought that one server 
              could handle all of this load should be shot.&quot; Another replied, 
              &quot;No…. slowly tortured.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The game creators 
              should have seen these problems ahead of time. The game was supposed 
              to be stress tested. I logged in from 4am to 8am EST to test how 
              well this game works during the least populated hours. I still crashed 
              every 25 minutes, couldn't zone, and suffered from intolerable lag.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I do not see 
              how &quot;FunCom&quot; will be able to recover from this oversight. 
              It will take too long to set up hardware to accommodate demand. 
              It will take too long to reprogram how the server software handles 
              network traffic. There is simply to much work to be done to repair 
              this game, and it is unlikely that Funcom will have the resources 
              to do so. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Apparently they 
              have 35,000 players in AO. Their login server can handle 700 logins 
              per hour (max). You do the math.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the meantime, 
              Funcom has hundreds of thousands of screaming customers who paid 
              $60.00 for this game and another $20.00 just to log in. These customers 
              will not want to wait the months it will take to repair the flaws 
              that make the game unplayable. Especially as there are alternative 
              graphic-based MMORPGs out there to choose from.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Graphics</u></b><br>
              The graphics for the game are very nice -on par with EverQuest or 
              Ultima Online. The user interface is also well-designed and easy 
              to use. All of this helps little when your character can't sit or 
              stand for 10 minute stretches because of network lag.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The actually 
              variety in graphics is only average. Many of the textures on character 
              armor look similar. Characters do not look as different from each 
              other as they do in EverQuest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Game Mechanics</u></b><br>
              The game mechanics in AO are very poorly documented. More than half 
              of the objects you interact with in the world will have no supporting 
              documentation. Well over half the actions you take, like making 
              groups, setting up chat channels, creating items, using items, will 
              be undocumented.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the worst 
              features of this game is the inability for two people who start 
              the game at the same time to actually play with each other. I tried 
              contacting my old EQ buddy Sanctume for some &quot;barshing&quot; 
              in the Omni-1 zone newbie area. The problem is that there is not 
              just 1 newbie area, but many possible spawned newbie areas. When 
              you enter one area the Server will randomly place you in an existing 
              &quot;spawned&quot; area or create a new one. The odds of you ending 
              up in the same area as your friend are slim. After hours of trying, 
              Sanctume and I were unable to meet with and group with each other. 
              How sad.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, as you 
              progress in levels, it is easier to &quot;hook up&quot; with your 
              friends. However, there is still always the possibility of the two 
              of you entering the same zone only to have your buddy shunted off 
              to an alternate spawn of that area.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the 
              outdoor NPC vendors are only able to talk with one person at a time. 
              This causes ludicrously long lines or even mobs of players who surround 
              the NPC, constantly clicking on him to try to get his attention. 
              Other &quot;machine&quot; vendors, and spawned stores do not suffer 
              from this problem as much.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><u>Conclusion</u></b><br>
              While the concepts behind the game, the graphics, and the Sci-fi 
              aspect of the game are appealing, the awful playability destroys 
              any hope for the game. I give AO a rating of &quot;Almost Useless&quot;.</font></p>
