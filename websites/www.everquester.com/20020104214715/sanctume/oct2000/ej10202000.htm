          from the bank to the docks. Among the busy was a dwarf hauling many 
          precious pieces from the Plane of Sky and many parchments of magical 
          scroll. Two local workers follow behind with crates of Kaladim's finest, 
          dwarven ale.</font></p>

          the Emerald Jungle of this putrid beast. No lizard with a haircut as 
          bad as his should be allowed to live for long! For our third slaying, 
          we looted a Shield of the Green Dragon (unrewarded), a green dragon 
          scale (unrewarded), a Nagafen Bag (Rendition, Falcon Star), and a Nagafen 
          Book (vault). In addition, his stinking corpse yielded 4 spells [Divine
