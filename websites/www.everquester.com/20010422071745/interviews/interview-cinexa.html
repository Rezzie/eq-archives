          <p class="keg">Recently Mareth (our hero) went undercover again to the Freeport 
            Wizard's guild to finally get some answers out of the Uber-wizzy Cinexa. 
            Here's what he found out: 
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> How long have you been playing 
            EQ?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> I started on May 14, 1999 after 
            being *told* I HAD to buy the damn
            game by Beancloud on the Might and Magic boards. Heard about EQ for 
            months
            and months before that and watched as my board friends vanished faster 
            than
            water on hot tar. Bought EQ and MMVII the same day....MMVII is *still*
            unfinished!
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> How has EQ affected your daily 
            life?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> Oh dear....loaded question...my 
            life revolves around my kids and
            then EQ....at times EQ is first /sigh. Let's just say that when I'm 
            not
            playing EQ I'm dreaming about orc pawns attacking me in my sleep. 
            I play
            alot and have the time to....I'm home all day and have great computers. 
            I
            can cook dinner while I med....I can throw a load of laundry in while 
            I
            zone....so EQ is weaved heavily into my life...
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> I know the feeling. Cept I can't 
            gain any levels cause my
            neighbors are all red and groups suck here.
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Briefly describe Cinexa
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> BRIEFLY??? ahahahaha Cin is 
            a wizard...I've always played wizards
            from D&amp;D on paper in the 70s....something about wizards fascinates 
            me. Born
            in Felwithe very clueless and without friends in the game that were
            known....Cinexa struggled to get OUT of Felwithe and to understand 
            her
            abilities. (casting okiels radiation on the mobs is NOT a good thing 
            - did
            that for 7 or 8 levels!! till someone told me to cast it on MYSELF 
            *gasp*)
            Spent most of her early years in Felwithe....moved to the evil orcs 
            in
            Butcherblock and alternated with Sisters in Lfay...met a dashing paladin 
            and
            found herself deep in a romance. Was amazed when a high level ranger
            befriended me at level 20 or so and handed me my first piece of phat
            lewt.....dusty bloodstained gloves. Those are still with me to this 
            day.
            Eventually formed friendships and found that a guild was a *good*
            thing....Joined Knights of Peace and married the paladin in lfay at 
            the
            faeries. Good lord my memory is hazy here.....*wonders how she got 
            to
            60*....spent heavy duty time killing dorfs in OOT - became a fixture 
            there
            for a long long time....joined League of Levity and made some very 
            dear
            friends there....Lewick, Fxdeebee and his wife ...met a marvelous
            Mage..Chrysalis, Axiomal, Insidius and Amulrion are all still good 
            friends.
            I was very hesitant to venture forth ....Cinexa is, after all, shy 
            at this
            point and intimidated by people who are experts playing .....was told 
            to go
            to Solb for the 40s - best xp in the game ...but felt that was akin 
            to going
            to Fear/Hate....*gasp* venture into the land of Lava and thru the 
            evil
            Nektulos....I couldn't imagine it and the first trip there was
            TERRIFYING....eventually became a fixture in Solb and totally enjoyed 
            my
            time there....was driven to get 50 and catch up with all my high level
            friends. I began spending countless hours in Kedge and met some of 
            my
            closest friend there those days. Kedge was my favorite zone in the 
            game.
          <p class="keg">Slowly discovered I was one of the few females in a mainly male
            game!....that fact presented some interesting encounters .......and 
            I will
            leave out of THIS interview !!! I'm still looking for a Pool Boy for 
            the
            summer .......it seems to be a tough position to fill! I'm rambling 
            here
            aren't I?? Fast forward....hmmm after being in League of Levity for 
            a large
            portion of winter/spring 2000....I learned the planes and developed 
            my
            skillz there....eventually I left to join Aeon and attempted to help 
            run
            that guild. Fun while it lasted but not conducive to high level encounters.
            Made some good friends there as well. I left Aeon last summer and 
            floated
            as independent for months slaying approximately 100000000000000000000 
            frogs
            in sebilis and leveling to 60 between there and Howling Stones. I 
            was
            content to remain independent as the political stuff attached with 
            guilds
            was wearing me out. I wanted to just play!! I was invited by KEG to 
            help
            slay Venril Sathir and for a while during the summer it became a regular
            thing ....began spending more time with them and eventually was invited 
            to
            join KEG. We have a lot of fun don't we?! I enjoy it alot...mostly
            ....cept when discussion of dragon head gets out of line....what's 
            with the
            body parts anyway? How long did I carry that Giant's head or those 
            HG toes
            in my bags ....gawd the STINK?!?! Rambling again....ok well anyway 
            Cinexa
            is chatty, loyal, truthful and can be a pain at times. She's a wuss 
            in
            battle if getting hit but can kill an orc pawn in 4 seconds flat *smirk*
            ....She's made a ton of friends - a few enemies but mostly has enjoyed 
            her
            time in Norrath and must still....cause she's not retired just yet!
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Have I mentioned I clean pools? 
            Err anyway..
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Whats the difference between 
            Khistrich and a mallard with a cold?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> The red nose? oh no wait Khis 
            has a red nose too....The webbed feet?
            Can we get back to the Pool Boy please?!?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> One's a sick duck and I forgot 
            the rest...
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> What do you like most about 
            KEG?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> The expertise of the people 
            who play. People who truly know what
            they are doing and if they don't ....collectively, we really have 
            some
            KILLER ideas!
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Those killer ideas include when 
            guildchat degenerates into porn and
            sex? :P
          
          <p class="keg">Cinexa purrs.
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> What is your greatest achievement 
            in EQ?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> Level 60.....as a wizard ...it 
            was NOT easy and I pride myself on
            getting there in a semi reasonable time frame (for me the /cyber queen) 
            194
            days to 60 played to 60 isn't bad....shut up Kaz!!
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Speaking of /cyber, you still 
            owe me some...
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Whats the funniest thing you've 
            seen or heard while playing EQ?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> oh god Ignore the Dragon was 
            a riot and I had tears in my
            eyes....not to mention Snaggle and you in Kithicor that night.....I 
            was
            howling with laughter while snapping ss after ss! &lt;insert link 
            to pic
            here?&gt;
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Snaggle and I are secure in 
            our relationship...sadly we broke up
            though due to &quot;fur problems&quot;.
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> If you had any questions for 
            me, what would you ask?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> Do you talk the way you write? 
            Do you tell good stories? Are you
            coming to Vegas? Do you have kids? Do you like cheesecake?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> In order: Yes, most of the time. 
            Depends on the story, I'm DM of
            most my friend's D&amp;D games. Yes, I'm driving down. I just had 
            a son.
            Cheesecake is good however I pretty much stick to Mt. Dew and my own 
            home
            cooking (cause I rock at cooking).
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Do you prefer Boxers or Briefs?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> I prefer nothing. *smirk*
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> .....
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Ogre Rangers. Good idea or just 
            downright fruity?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> Do they make bows that big? 
            I mean an ogre with a barbie doll bow
            is pretty fruity isn't it?!
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Tarv reminds me of a big tubby 
            Orange.
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> If there was anything you could 
            change about your character, what
            would it be?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> I'd take her hair out of a pony 
            tail and have long blond ringlets
            with a tall pointy hat.. *smirk* Oh and I'd like sparkly shoes....like
            Dorothy....*click there's no place like home click click click*
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Thats the most frightening thing 
            I've ever heard.
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> What other question do YOU think 
            I should ask?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> hmmm hmmmm hmmm can't think 
            of any atm =( None that I'd ask in a
            public forum anyway =)
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Have you ever fallen off the 
            cliff going up Highpass?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> uhm no....I'm a very careful 
            traveler sir! but ick those eyes??
            Hated runnyeye....never hunted there =)
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Why am I the only one who's 
            fallen off of Highpass?
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> Well probably because you are 
            a tool.
          <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> WHAT THE HELL???? I AM NOT!!!! 
            THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER! GOOD DAY
            MAAM!
          <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Cinexa:</font> Good you were starting to bother 
            me, Barb. *Cinexa translocates
            Mareth to Tox*
