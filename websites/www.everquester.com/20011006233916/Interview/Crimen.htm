      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While bored last night, 
        I was in commons looking to sell my rusty spear.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I noticed this Wizzie 
        beating the snot out of some poor dumb newbie so I walked up to see what 
        was going on.  Lo and behold it was <font color="#FF0033"><b>Crimen</b></font>!  
        KEG's own SUPA wizzie that was roughing up the poor lad like he was some 
        mob enforcer.  I mean mafia hitman.  Err street tough?  DON'T HURT ME 
        CRIMEN I WAS JUST BEING DESCRIPTIVE!</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  
        &quot;DON'T EVER ASK ME FOR A PRICE CHECK ON BANDED AGAIN NEWBIE!&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  *cough*  
        Can I ask you a few questions Supa-Crimen?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  
        As long as it isn't for a bind, port, translocate, spare armor...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Uhh ok...what 
        keeps you logging on EQ?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Aside from a slacker job that lets me work from home and a computer? Would 
        have to be my friends, the guild and our accomplishments.  Once we beat 
        the next best encounter, we move on and find something else to challenge 
        us. Equally impressive is how we seek to refine our tactics and continue 
        to do better, even with older mobs. Yes, Venril Sathir can be killed with 
        12 people and no deaths. =)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Now that 
        Snubbles has left the guild, are you secure enough in my manhood to admit 
        that he's gay?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        He still says he isn't, but I wonder why he was always just outside GH 
        every day... I don't think I buy &quot;&lt;insert Ranger name&gt; owes 
        me money&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Whats the 
        most embarrassing thing thats happened to you in EQ?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        That would be when Megwedariel insisted I was getting hit way too much 
        and dying too often. I told her wizards didn't get neat tank skills like 
        'dodge', since I had 0 points in it. Then she told me my dodge skill wouldn't 
        go up until I trained one point in it. So at level 51, I trained my first 
        point in it. I died a lot less after that. Well, until I got my 52 DD 
        spell.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  What do you 
        like most about KEG?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The fact that we can get things done, yet keep it light hearted and fun 
        a majority of the time. The sense of humor and sharp wit of some of our 
        guildmates makes it worth it.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  How does 
        Crimen differ in game from the RL Crimen?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        About 99.28% Maybe a tad more even.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Cyber.  Good 
        or Bad?  Describe your answer.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Definitely Good. Talk about feeling loved! And a stress relief. Do any 
        of the vendors sell cigs?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  If you could 
        kick anyone in guild in the nuts twice who *Sinlar* would it be *Sinlar*?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        I can only pick one person?! But so many deserver it.. I'd say Sinlar 
        but that probably turns him on. I'd say Duvlin but he'd ask me &quot;HOW 
        MUCH DOES YOUR FOOT WEIGH?!?&quot;. I'd say Yukitaro but he'd train me 
        (again) instead of kicking me. I guess I'd have to say Mareth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Whats the 
        funniest thing you've seen while playing EQ?  And no your cat exploding 
        doesn't count but feel free to mention it anyhow...</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        IGNORE THE DRAGON! Every day I see funny things that keep the game amusing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Have you 
        ever participated in stealing Jerrica's pants?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Since 5 game years have passed and the statute of limitations is up.. 
        yes! She logged in to find herself pantless at least once because of me. 
        At least I didn't bank them!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  If you had 
        any question for me, what would it be?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        How do you live with yourself knowing you are the big GH lovin tool that 
        you are? I mean, doesn't that throw you into mad fits of depression where 
        you contemplate ranger gayness all over Norrath and eventually throw yourself 
        off the cliff near High Hold Pass?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  @#$@#$ just 
        because I have a key to GH doesn't mean I hunt there! And I stopped contemplating 
        ranger gayness when Lewick told me he only had a thing for men wearing 
        green /boggle.  AND I FELL OFF HIGHPASS DAMMIT I DIDN'T JUMP!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  Who's the 
        pimpest guy in all da world?  Hint:  He's the leader of KEG's own gold 
        pants club...</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        It would have to be this one shaman I know. He is SO pimp, always takes 
        care of me etc. Sandrak rules, not like that tool Mareth! But I think 
        San wears chain mail, not GHold pants..</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth: Sandrak wants 
        my gold pants.  He wants to be me cause I am Prince and I am funky.  Err 
        anyhow, have you ever fallen off the cliff on the way to High Hold Pass?</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        YES! Hah, just kidding. Only a tool would fall off that ten lane highway.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  WTF?  Whats 
        this tool stuff???  I THINK I'VE TAKEN ENOUGH ABUSE SISSY!  THATS IT!  
        /duel Crimen</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0033" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supa-Crimen:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">  
        Haha.  *Crimen begins to cast a spell*</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mareth:  *loading 
        please wait*</font></p>
