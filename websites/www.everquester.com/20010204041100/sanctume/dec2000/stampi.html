  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> The legend 
    of Stampi the Mascot spawns a new breed of follower... Baleen Drakkar started 
    the day like any other normal monk would by fighting the evil lants that had 
    infested The Overthere.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

    He also liked to get in some good cyber with wood elves...as shown here where 
    Autumnmoon was asking to rub her chest on him.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><img src="stampicyber.jpg" width="703" height="311"></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Then as 
    a call went out to destroy the evil Zordak Ragefire in Sol B, Baleen remembered 
    hearing about a low level warrior in another time and place that lead his 
    friends to victory.&nbsp; Baleen decided to honor this warrior's sacrifice 
    by doing the same.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
    Zordak was confronted.&nbsp; Baleen was shaking...outwardly he didn't show 
    it.&nbsp; He kept up his bravado and rallied his troops in shouts and deed.<br>

    &nbsp; <br>
    The Knights of Eternal Good won the day, luckly having Baleen the Rathe's 
    Stampi Mascot to lead them to victory.&nbsp; They were drunk with thier victory 
    and they asked him to lead them against Feydedar.&nbsp; Baleen agreed, for 
    nothing can stop the Stampi Mascot!&nbsp; The guild arrived in Timourus Deep 
    and the Dragon (tadpole?) was engaged...Baleen called the battlecry of "FOR 
    THE GLORY OF STAMPI" and "REMEMBER THE STAMPI ELEPHANT". &nbsp; <br>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For his 
    valor, the gods awarded Baleen with the last name of Stampi, to further honor 
    his hero from another time and place.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">THIS IS 
    FOR YOU STAMPI ELEPHANT !!! FOR THE GLORY OF STAMPI !!!</font></p>
