        <p><b><font color="#00FF00">NOTE: </font></b><font color="#00FF00">This 
          plan will be updated for the Friday, March 17th, 2000, Fear Raid. Some 
          aspects of the plan will change, most will remian the same. Please re-read 
          this plan just prior to going on the Fear raid.</font></p>
        <p><b><font size="-1">Disclaimer</font></b><font size="-1">: This is a 
          proven strategy if executed properly. Special thanks to BotS guild on 
          the Rathe for discovering the north wall camp spot. Here is what you 
          must be prepared for in order for it to be successful:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">You will die at least once during initial setup.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Be prepared to die about 4 times throughout the 
            course of the evening. If this price is too high to pay, please notify 
            me and you will be removed from the Fear raid.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Have a newbie character ready.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Know who your group leader is, so that you can send 
            them tells as to when it is safe to log-in/zone/etc. during initial 
            setup.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Be on time. The raid starts at 9pm EST. If you are 
            late, you will miss the opportunity to run to camp, die, and be resurrected. 
            If you are late, your next opportunity to log in will probably be 
            much later, when the area around the portal is cleared.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>The Plan</u></b></font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font size="-1">The CR (corpse recovery) group will be logged into 
            Fear and camped at the North wall Camp (1390, 500) prior to Fear spawning. 
            After camping, they will be reentering the game as newbie characters 
            until it is time to log in and start resurrecting.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">At 9pm EST we will start sending in people one at 
            a time. You will be fully buffed. You will have invisible or superior 
            camouflage, see invisible, resist magic, dead-man floating, and spirit 
            of the wolf, in addition to any health buffs available. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Upon zoning in, you will immediately run Northeast 
            toward the Tentacle Terrors that reside under the hourglass (they 
            do not see invisible). Then run due north towards the wall of fire 
            along the path shown on this <a href="graphics/maps/fearsnag2.jpg" target="_self">map</a>. 
            Do not run blindly. If you see a spinechill spider or shiverback, 
            try to steer clear of it. They can see invisible. You probably wont 
            see Scarelings, but they will see you, so be prepared for a quick 
            death.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">If you fail to reach the camp spot, we will recover 
            your corpse once that area is secure. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once you reach the camp, let whatever mobs are on 
            you (80% chance for rookies to be spotted :&gt;) kill you. That's 
            right, die there.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">If by some stroke of luck nothing saw you. Camp 
            out. Log in as newbie. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Send your group leader (or Shomari .. aka Snaggle, 
            if group leader is unavailable) a message that you are &quot;in&quot;. 
            At this point we will send in the next victim.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once everyone is in and safely dead, we will begin 
            ressing the Scout group and the Mez group. Any members of these groups 
            whose bodies are currently irrecoverable will be temporarily replaced 
            by members of other groups.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The initial three groups will clear a relative safe 
            spot around the camp. We will then start dragging corpses that didn't 
            make it close enough in for rezzes.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">We will rezz the remaining groups. During this time 
            we will try to minimize fighting due to the threat of packet loss 
            and linkdeath.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once all groups are in we will begin to pull from 
            the west, then make our way south. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once the zone is clear, we will clear the temple 
            and make it safe to zone out.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">If Cazic Thule has spawned, we will attempt to kill 
            him after we clear the temple.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="-1"><u><b>Contingencies</b></u></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">If Cazic Thule and Draco have spawned the zone will 
            be much more dangerous. To take down the Dracolich, we may reorganize 
            groups to mirror dragon-raid type groups.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">If everyone dies horribly due to someone training 
            while CR is being performed. We will take the remaining groups and 
            fall on the backup plan.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>The Backup Plan</u></b></font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font size="-1">Zone in invisible with three groups in rapid succession 
            and secure the West Wall Camp. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once camp is secured bring in additional groups 
            (if any). </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Kill any roamers first then work our way north then 
            east. This plan is our traditional Fear plan, and usually involves 
            much death and evacing. Eventually, it does work. But it hurts like 
            hell.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>Guidelines</u></b></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">Assist Snaggle. Make a button that types /assist 
            Snaggle. Use this button whenever a pull is incoming. Once the target 
            is dead, wait until Snaggle (that's me) engages the next target then 
            mash your &quot;Assist Snaggle Button.&quot; As the night progresses 
            you may be changing your button to &quot;Assist Yukitaro&quot;, or 
            &quot;Assist Vardamin&quot;, etc.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">In the case of a pull with multiple mobs that are 
            mesmerized, do not engage the mesmerized mob until the tanks have 
            all taunted it at least twice (ideally three times). This keeps our 
            enchanters/bards from dying.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">If you find yourself in the position of being swarmed 
            by mobs away from the group, die there. Do not pull a train into the 
            group. There will be one official puller at all times. Anyone else 
            who pulls, be prepared to die.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The group leader will be responsible for looting. 
            Do not loot a mob in the midst of battle. Wait for the battle to cease 
            so that your group leader may loot.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Do not, under any circumstance, ask a GM to respawn 
            the zone. Doing so is bad. Very, very bad.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Do not invite GMs or Guides along to watch us. Although 
            we love them dearly, they have been known to aggravate mobs and train 
            parties in Fear. Furthermore, they usually observe our tactics, then 
            report them to the development team. The development team likes to 
            tweak things with the next patch to make them much harder. You are 
            in OUR zone now. Grah!</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">There will be a pop quiz in the morning. This is 
            not an open book quiz and grades will not be curved. Study your Fear 
            Guidelines.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>Loot</u></b></font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Loot will be distributed in the following order:</font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font size="-1"><i>By need</i> - Determined by guildmasters/guild 
            officers. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"><i>By mutual decision or random number among applicable 
            classes</i> - It will be decided who gets the item based on class 
            need, then by random number.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="-1">If the majority of people object to this method, we 
          will fall back on distributing loot by random number.</font></p>
