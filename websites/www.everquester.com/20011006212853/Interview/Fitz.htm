      <p><i><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Note:  For those 
        that dunno, Mareth now is Baleen.  I'm just as pymp tho.</font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the most recent 
        KEG gathering I woke up in Kerra Isle, dressed in a Japanese Schoolgirl 
        outfit holding an eggplant.  It appeared I had won the &quot;Drink-Fitz-Under-The-Table&quot; 
        Contest.  My wallet and alchemy bag were missing.  There could only be 
        one person responsible (well aside from Yuki...he thinks we should pay 
        for cyber from him for some reason)! I changed back into my monk clothes 
        and headed off to track down the elusive Fitz.  I wasn't expecting it 
        to be difficult, last night he noticed Jerrica drunk on Lendel's Pale 
        Ale and was attempting to put her pants back on.  Or so he claimed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I called Jerrica on 
        the guildline and had her leg port me to Misty Thicket where Fitz was 
        nursing his Tumpy Tonic hangover.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Woot 
        thanks for coming to pick me up Jerr!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jerrica</b>:  Umm 
        I had to, you have my pants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Oh 
        shit, I *thought* these were too tight!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jerrica</b>:  Here's 
        yours back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Umm 
        you may want to wash those...I don't remember where they have been.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jerrica</b>:  *mumbles* 
        not like I'm gonna wear them anyhow...</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  What?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jerrica</b>:  Nothing!  
        PORTING!<br>
        LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br>
        You have entered Misty Thicket</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Hey 
        thanks Jerr.  Whats up Fitz?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: *rubs 
        head* Hey Jerrica...did you say your Hail Disneys this morning? Probably 
        gonna need at least 100 after last night.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jerrica</b>: !!!!!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Hey 
        Bal, I heard you were trying to get a pass to GH by wearing more green, 
        but why are you wearing Jerrica's pants?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Jerrica</b>:  ....  
        THOSE ARE NOT MINE!!  *ports*</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Well 
        its not like we see her with pants on that often anyhow......anyway, lets 
        start the interview!  Oh and gimmie my alchemy bag back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: ....alchemy 
        bag? Why Marethmonk, I have no idea what you are talking about.  Say..*points* 
        is that Aradune? *takes a hit from the bag*</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  *turns 
        around having missed the green power ranger siting* How does it feel to 
        be a rebel pymp mac daddy like myself?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Well 
        as I have been a rebel pimp mac daddy all my life I guess the most obvious 
        answer is that it feels like me.  It is a lonely exsistence. Never can 
        I take a chance of some young SLR getting through my flame hardened exterior 
        in order to embrace my heart and more carnal desires.  I must never let 
        my guard down, or else I will be taken advantage of repeatedly..manipulated 
        to Random SLR's demented desires and left dumb, broke, and hungover in 
        some alley of Freeport.  You know Mar, kinda like what you did last weekend.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Ahh 
        heh ya...what was that SLR's name again?  Mystycal or somethin? Anyhow..Whats 
        your favorite thing about EQ?  Don't include uber raids please...that 
        answer's been taken :P</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Well, 
        my favorite thing about EQ is doing new things.  I love challenges. (umm 
        no Mareth, I do not consider staring in your duck porn films a new challenge 
        so STFU) (*EDITORS NOTE:  We at KEG do NOT support duck porn or anything 
        relating to duck porn.  Mareth does that all on his own*)  The debates 
        in /gu about tactics and strategies, deciding together what to use and 
        then putting those strategies into perfect execution is a great high for 
        me.  At that point, I don't even care if we win or lose.  The healthy 
        debate leading to confident consensus as we head into battle are their 
        own rewards.  <br>
        <br>
        Some of my most memorable EQ moments have been when we failed on something 
        a couple of times, redefining our tactics more and more, and then just 
        completely destroying the target the 3rd or so time.  Can't leave KEG 
        out though.   I have given KEG well over two years  now and during that 
        time have gotten far more in the way of friendships and fun than I could 
        have ever expected.  Without exception, I can say I feel a special affinity 
        to all that have shared the guildtag with me....past/present  and future.  
        If we were doing the old school Nag/Vox/CT/Inny/Maestro/Dracho 24 hour 
        bursts or if we were just chilling in lguk when no one else had even heard 
        of froglocks....it was and always has been done KEG Style.  That usually 
        involves Yuki trains, NIN lyrics from Alkarn in /gu, Ced's bad jokes to 
        snap us back to reality, and the constant contest to see how many !!!'s 
        we can get out of the ladies of KEG.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Before 
        I forget, lets do some word association.  Here goes: Trailer Trash.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: Population 
        of Halas</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Guildkiller.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: Of course, 
        Yujitaro</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Realdoll.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: Too Fragile 
        errr Khistrich's girlfriend</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Tool.  
        @#%@#$@#$  WHO THE HELL HAS BEEN GETTING INTO MY NOTES????</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Human 
        green wearing wanna be ranger monk that has taken way too many hits from 
        the alchemy bag</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Grr, 
        Ok forget word association...What would you change about EQ?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Hmm...So 
        much that I would change but I will try to pick one.  I think I would 
        make stats mean a little more, and a lot harder to max with temp buffs 
        and stuff.  A roll playing game loses a lot of potential when stats like 
        dex and agility mean so little and it is easy for any character to reach 
        max in any stat with buffs. I would really like to see the uber mobs dropping 
        a few more items a kill too.  50 people to kill a mob that drops 2 or 
        3 things is awful.  I think all the huge mobs should drop at least 6 items 
        and have potential of up to 10.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Ok 
        here's a biggie:  People are prolly wondering if you talk IRL the same 
        as you talk on the boards...do you?  (For everyone thats wondering...I 
        DO)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Well, 
        yes and no.  I consider myself a straight up honest person overall and 
        that has gotten me in trouble both in-game and out.  I am definitely more 
        blunt and outspoken on the message boards than I am in real life...but 
        the words/feelings are the same in most regards.  I mean while I may not 
        get out of my car at a stop light and bang on the window of the bitz that 
        just cut me off, on the message boards I will flame someone in a heartbeat 
        if they deserve it.  I would mention my Partnership for an Idiot free 
        America campaign if it didn't apply to current company.  In short, I am 
        not a witty, sneaky, sexy halfling in real life...I just play one in EQ.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>: Ever 
        get that sinking feeling you've been insulted and don't know why?  Err 
        anyway, what is your greatest EQ related petpieve?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: I really 
        really hate when people hide behind the anonimity of an online game to 
        negatively affect someone else's gaming experience...as in train them, 
        ninja loot their kills...etc.  Even worse, is when people take names different 
        from their in-game character onto a message board to flame someone.  How 
        cowardly do you have to be to use an alias of an alias to flame someone?  
        hehe come on.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>: What 
        is your favorite mini flame?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: I have 
        a particular liking to calling someone a pathetic waste of carbon.  Or 
        maybe calling them a shit stain in the great gene pool.  Or sometimes, 
        when I meet a really sad person, I call them a barbarian.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  We 
        all know Sinlar's a dude...why then do we continue to cyber him??</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: What 
        do you mean WE bitz? You got a mouse in your pocket? No Habla Sinlar Scepter.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Sinlar 
        would beg to differ methinks...its cool, denial is where Tald still hangs 
        out too.  Describe Fitz all r0leplaying like.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Fitz 
        is a prankster both in verbal warfare and deed.  While having a caring 
        heart he hides behind a quick wit and even quicker weapon. Sneaky, very 
        perceptive, very rarely reveals his whole &quot;hand&quot; and must be 
        a masochist cause he gets beat to hell and back while stubbornly trying 
        to pull x uber mob when a monk could do it so much better.  Truly a lonely 
        exsistence but I would not have it any other way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>: So 
        Fitz, tell us...why do you flame?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: I flame, 
        therefore I am. I flame not to make others look smaller, or to point out 
        the how many completely idiotic people actually learned how to type...I 
        flame because I love to amuse myself.  Akin to telling newbies how to 
        /execute god mode and watching you try and pick up rangers in GH..flaming 
        amuses me.  It is selfish...only to amuse myself, and while most people 
        get 10% of the subtle humor, those that know me get 70% of it...anyone 
        that gets all of my subtle references either needs to get their head examined...or 
        if they are female, rich and young can send me an email at .....errr need 
        to get their head examined.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  If 
        you had any question(s) for me, what would you ask?  Well don't write 
        a book or nothin, but ask what you think the public wants to know!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: How do 
        you smuggle your alchemy bag past the Freeport Militia when you go to 
        visit your family in the sewers?  Ever been in a Turkish Prison? Did you 
        know there is a HighPass citizen claiming that you left &quot;small, shallow 
        holes&quot; in one of the pies she left in the window to cool?  Why do 
        the lady barbs with deep voices in Halas call you Craftsman? wouldn't 
        have anything to do with you being a TOOL for life would it?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Hrm...not 
        sure how to answer.  Lets leave it at &quot;mmmmm Barb chicks&quot;.  
        Play any games other than EQ?   Looking forward to any games coming out 
        in the future?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>:  Man, 
        I am a game addict.  I play as many board games as computer games.  The 
        first Computer RPG I ever played though still has a special place in my 
        heart.  Might and Magic 1.   I started playing that game way back when 
        I was about 12 years old or so on a neighbor's computer.  It was so awesome.  
        Since then I have played and beat every one of the sequels and still drool 
        over the thought that MM9 is coming out soon.  Other than that, I really 
        wish a RTS game would come out that could even approach the feel of Total 
        A. That game rocked so much and no other RTS I have played has compared 
        in my mind.   Favorite game of all time though is a board game called 
        TITAN.  It is out of print now but definitely the best game to ever be 
        created.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Ever 
        fallen off the cliff going up Highpass?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: In a 
        word...yes.  Many times.  Funny story but I will keep it short. In beta 
        I played a ....ranger.  Full leather armor bought with the profits made 
        while fishing for several days.  I decided finally to leave the Qeynos 
        area so I headed out across the big bad world.  Got to the High Pass area 
        after narrowly escaping death many times.  (I loved unlimited jumping, 
        could escape anything) After making it all the way there, I am running 
        up the pass and boom...missed the ledge and fell to my death.  Poof...appeared 
        back outside surefall (WTF is a bind?) and went back to fishing.  Never 
        again ventured out of Qeynos area for the rest of beta, but I did become 
        master of BlackBurrow and later helped kill the giant gnolls that appeared 
        there at the end of beta. <br>
        <br>
        Course, only a tool would actually do that during Retail. Man, I can't 
        imagine anyone so toolish to do that after EQ was released...least I can 
        claim it was some bug in beta or something to hide my shame.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  ....  
        Ya I uhh know what you mean.  Who would do such a dumbass thing?????</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Fitz</b>: Yea, 
        probably some Barbarian tool that used to be a shaman and became a monk 
        because tight leather had a better chance of getting him into GH. Say 
        Marethmonk...I have noticed you have a bit of a stoop in your posture....did 
        I tell you I am quite the chiropraticioner? *fades out with evil gleam 
        in Fitz's eyes as he slowly pulls  his nightfall from a hidden pocket*</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Baleen</b>:  Great.  
        Now i'm trapped here in the land of the little people. Shoulda let him 
        keep the alchemy bag.  Hrm...wonder if they sell lolipops and cotton candy 
        inside</font></p>
