          from the life of <b>Santume SpiritStone</b>, Cleric of Brell.</font></i></font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The port of Firiona 
            Vie was bustling with activity which is very common on for a Saturday 
            morning. A young pilgrim from the docks carefully carried a large 
            crate into the nearby housing. There she set her heavy burden and 
            picked a pouch full of coins.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was Saturday 
            indeed because the weekly shipment of Kaladim's finest, Dwarven Ale, 
            have arrived to his doorsteps. The unsmiling dwarf opened the crate 
            with practiced ease. He broke the wax seal, uncorked the brown bottle, 
            and proceeds to drink right out of the bottle. &quot;Ahh, such sweet 
            taste of home,&quot; says Sanctume, as he enters the house with the 
            new supply of booze.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just when Sanctume 
            was about to start on his third bottle of ale, the courier arrived 
            with several scrolls. On one particular scroll relayed the following 
            message...</font></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><font color="#33CC33">To

            <p><font color="#33CC33" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The 
              Votes have been casted, and the Results have been confirmed by Sanctume 
              SpiritStone and Kulvarian.<br>
              Your presence is requested for today's gathering at Emerald Jungle, 
              in the continent of Kunark.<br>

          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Cleric of 
            Brell donned his armor, prayed for his blessings, and kissed his wives 
            good bye. The day was full of hope, and will be full of celebration 
            because the ale will flow freely. Even news of Marklin, his friend, 
            was coming home from a far away journey. It is a good day for a celebration!</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The way to Emerald 
            Jungle was made haste from the magical winds of the Druids. Many were 
            already there cheering and laughing. Today, they celebrate the union 
            of their friends into the ranks of the Knights of Eternal Good:</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Today's celebration 
            was blessed with the presence and challenge of Severilous, a foul 
            Shaman-Dragon, in the bowels of Emerald Jungle. Today, the Knights 
            of Eternal Good sacrificed a handful deaths as they learn more and 
            gather tactics to defeat the beast in the days to come.</font></p>

            think that today's celebration will only consist of friendly cheers 
            and good booze? A KEG celebration is good barshing, spells fizzling, 
            and corpse piling. It is one of the ingredience at work that makes 
            us <b>best</b>, and bonds our friendship even more stronger.</font></p>
