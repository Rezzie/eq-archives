    <td class="keg"><strong>How do I join KEG?</strong>
    <br>
    <p class="keg">
    Thanks for the inquiry. We don't have a freeze on new memberships, per se. 
    There is no level requirement to be accepted into KEG. However, we do not 
    accept membership applications. KEG is an "invite only" guild. I recommend 
    to those who wish to join KEG that they make a point to get to know a great 
    deal of our members. Party with them, adventure with them, etc. When we do 
    decide to invite new members, the guild has to approve the member by 80% 
    margin. It is difficult to get into KEG. However, KEG members are the best 
    trained, best equipped, and most loyal of any of the guilds on our server. 
    KEG is a family more than a guild. A group of friends that have come to rely 
    on each other through thick and thin. I wish you luck should you choose to 
    pursue membership in KEG. Feel free to contact me in game if you have any 
    additional questions regarding membership.

    <strong>The Knights of Eternal Good Membership Voting Rules</strong>
    <p class="keg">
    Summary: Each KEGger has a vote, and that the would be KEGger needs at least a 80% approval. Officers will then have to make sure things are "OK" prior to doing a /guildinvite. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Voting Rules Amended.
    <p class="keg">
    <strong>3</strong>. Interpretation: At least a 80% YES vote of all the votes cast (number of YES & NO votes) is required to for KEG membership.

    <strong>3a.</strong> NO vote conclusion: A person not attaining the 80% YES votes may still be subjected to future membership consideration at the discretion of the current officers and GM. 
    Summary: Each KEGger has a vote, and that the would be KEGger needs at least a 85% approval. Officers will then have to make sure things are "OK" prior to doing a /guildinvite. 
    <p class="keg">
    <strong>1.</strong> Rights: Every member of KEG has one vote. 
    <p class="keg">
    <strong>2.</strong> Vote Options: Based on the recent poll (Feb 2000), a great percent of KEGgers wanted to see only a YES or NO option. (Note: I very much agree to this by using the analogy of a "jury" where you as a jury may only vote YES or NO in the end. By doing so, we give every member the responsibility to learn about the candidate for themselves. In turn, we let every member have the power to debate their vote to persuade or guide others who are undecided.) 
    <p class="keg">
    <strong>3.</strong> Interpretation: At least a 85% YES vote of all the votes cast (number of YES & NO votes) is required to for KEG membership.
