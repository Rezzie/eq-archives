          last Thursday to slay Phingel Atropos. This time, he dropped a <a href="graphics/items/rodmalise.jpg" target="_self">Rod

          Cauldronboil, more details are forthcoming.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">The Fear raid Friday night was a partial success. We 
          had 72 people in the zone, and had cleared about 1/3 of the spawns when 
          the zone crashed. Unfortunately, the GMs could not respawn the zone 
          for us at that time, due to people who logged out with their corpses 
          still present in the zone. KEG returned to Fear on Saturday with a much 
          smaller group and managed to clear out Fear. There are a number of new 
          weapons and armor that the various mobs drop (too many to list here 
          - check EQ'Lizer). I will mail any screenshots of new equipment to EQ'Lizer 
          if I find their listings are lacking.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I wont be online much Wednesday or Thursday due to 
          planning the Fear raid. I implore Keggers who have not signed up to 
          do so soon. I also need &quot;wish lists&quot; for loot in POF. Here 
          is an example of one player's wish list:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Top 10 Items Desired from Fearplane: </font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font size="-1"> Valorium Vambraces. (to replace the cool looking 
            but fairly lame Rubi) </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> Valorium Greaves. (Same purpose) </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> Valorium Breastplate </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> Valorium Boots </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Valorium Gauntlets </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> Valorium Bracers </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> Any ultra cool shield that might be obtained. i.e.: 
            Shield of Rainbow Hues </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> Valorium Helm (almost didn't make the list cause 
            it'll look like a tin can on me head.) </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1"> I don't know what kind of weaponry that might be 
            there that Paladins can use.. but I haven't seen any descriptions 
            of any so, Pretty sure that 9 and 10 will be moot for me. However.. 
            should we discover a Cool Belt or Cape Item there that is usable by 
            Paladins.. these slots will suffice as free space for them.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="-1">This is a good example of what I would like to see 
          from everyone who is signing up. It allows us to set up a heirarchy 
          of &quot;need&quot; and distribute loot in a more equitable fashion 
          than randomly rolling for looted items.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">Dalia is helping me with the Fear map. I hope to have 
          it finished in time. If not, we will use the map recently posted on 
          EQVault, although it is not terribly accurate and lacks a bit of detail.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I am postponing the Fear raid until next weekend. By 
          then we will have full sign ups, and a better strategy. I will be devoting 
          the next few days to scouting Fear for the best landing spot. People 
          will probably still be doing Fear on Friday, but this particular event 
          is postponed until October 29th, 9pm EST.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">So far, not enough people have signed up for the Fearplane 
          assault this weekend. If you want to sign up, here is what I need:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">An email from you (not a buddy or guildmate) stating 
            you want to participate.</font></li>

          <li><font size="-1">A list of top ten items you need from Fearplane 
            (in order of need).</font></li>

            night to Saturday morn). </font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="-1">Email <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">snaggle@everquester.com</a> 
          to sign up. Here is a list of the <a href="fear/feargroups.htm" target="_self">groups 
          participating</a>. If you signed up via email, and your name is not 
          on the list, then I do not know what class and level you are. If we 
          do not get enough people by Wednesday evening, then the assault will 
          be pushed back a week. We need at least 4 groups, and at most 6 groups.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">There is a reason that I am being so picky about the 
          sign ups. Everyone will have printout of the plan. Everyone will have 
          a map. Everyone will know who they will be working with so that they 
          can plan ahead. Everyone will have a shot at loot based on need. To 
          execute flawlessly on this plan, we must be well-coordinated and well-prepared. 
          Lack of preparation and coordination are the two biggest obstacles of 
          a Fear raid (or at least two biggest we have control over). If you are 
          serious about breaking into Fear, then you will see the need for our 
          preparedness. </font></p>
