After           exchanging some barbed remarks with the dwarven cleric, Sanctume, Delkath           spoke of the coming of the avatar of Innoruk. The conversation was disjointed           at best. Here are some excerpts:</font></p>        <blockquote>           <p><font size="-1"><i>You say, 'Delkath what leads you to believe Innoruk             coming?'<br>            Delkath says, 'the coming of his daughter to maturity' </i></font></p>          <p><font size="-1"><i>You say, 'Who is the daughter of Innoruk, Delkath?'<br>            Delkath says, 'there will no doubt be many foolish people that attempt             to battle the avatar with sword and spell all are indeed foolish for             no such means will kill such a creature they must find another way             if they are to end the evil' </i></font></p>        </blockquote>        <p><font size="-1">This is about all of the useful information that could           be gleaned from Delkath before he faded away. He did not specify who           the daughter of Innoruk was, or if she was, in fact, the avatar to whom           he referred. His words seem to be related to the recent dark elf attacks           on the Commonlands and the Lair of Splitpaw.</font></p>        <blockquote>           <hr>        </blockquote>        <p><font size="-1">On a lighter note, KEG attended the wedding of Mikaela           and Donzi this past Sunday.

Sadly, the           dragon managed to vanish into thin air at the moment of his death. Little           did KEG know that this was the beginning of a nefarious plot on the           part of the foul wyrm to seek revenge for his demise not one week ago.</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">Unbeknownst to KEG, the dragon had appealed to his           mighty lord Veeshan, father of all dragons to spare his life and seek           revenge on the servants of light. Veeshan, in turn, assumed the guise           of Zatozia the Torturer, a known servant of Innoruk. In this form Veeshan,           through his evil deceptions, managed to beguile The Knights of Eternal           Good into trying once more to slay Nagafen, only this time the dragon           would be reduced to half health. Additionally, KEG would have the luxury           of summoning powerful allies from across Antonica to aid in the slaughter,           as KEG's forces had all but disbanded due to despair over the missing           dragon's corpse.</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">This was a brilliant move on the part of Veeshan. He           would use the Knights to summon the enemies that had plagued his children           for so long, more fuel for the devious trap he had in store. KEG agreed           to Veeshan's (Zatozia's) terms and provided the foul god with a list           of names that included many of his strongest foes. Heroes were summoned           from far and wide. Plans were made. The doppleganger of Zatozia instructed           the heroes to wait outside the lair while he &quot;summoned&quot; Lord           Nagafen. </font></p>        <p><font size="-1">A mock battle ensued between Zatozia and Lord Nagafen,           and when the dragon was at half health, Zatozia cried out for the heroes           to rush into the dragon's lair and finish the beast. The heroes charged.           A great battle ensued where it appeared that Lord Nagafen would succumb           to the combined forces of KEG, The Brotherhood Of the Spider, Clan Icewind,           and other notable heroes of the realm. </font></p>        <p><font size="-1">Just as the Lord Nagafen was about to perish, Veeshan           cast off his guise and appeared in his true form. So terrible was the           visage of this cruel god that it seemed time itself had frozen. A wave           of darkness spread over the throng casting them deep into shadow. </font></p>        <p><font size="-1">The heroes recovered one by one only to find that Nagafen           had been restored to full health. His servants the Fire Giants and the           dread Lord Rokyl emerged from hiding and made short work of the dazed           and bewildered heroes. The Knights of Eternal Good and their allies           were slain, some more than once as they had bound their spirits to the           very lair of the wyrm. Veeshan had won. Lord Nagafen had his revenge.</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">Had KEG only listened to the prophecies of Delkath           the Deceiver who attempted to warn KEG of this impending doom, this           fate may have been avoided. The words of Delkath echoed through the           minds of the survivors, &quot;Your time will come my friends, and when           you least expect it.&quot;</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">After the slaughter, the true Zatozia, Delkath, and           other immortals arrived to aid the heroes in recovering their corpses.           They could do little to repair the damage to the guild's psyche, or           the taint of distrust Veeshan had succeeded in sowing among the guilds           who had placed their trust in KEG.</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">As I write this letter, The Knights of Eternal Good           lay scattered across the realm. Their strength diminished. Their reputation           tarnished. Their souls weary. </font></p>        <p><font size="-1">Yet the bonds that bind this guild are stronger than           any god can sever. The gauntlet has been thrown down. The Knights of           Eternal Good now know their true enemy. They will reform, stronger than           before, more focused, and wiser for their efforts. For in this realm           there is no greater power than friendship, and true heroes never die.</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">-- Snaggle, Knight of Eternal Good</font></p>        <p><font size="-1"><b><u><br>          September 19th, 1999</u></b></font></p>        <p><font size="-1">On Saturday, September 18th, The Knights of Eternal           Good and friends once again slew Lady Vox. The death toll was minimal           compared to previous dragon attempts due to organization and good planning.           KEG would like to extend a special thanks to Clan Icewind for sending           a contingent of heroes to aid in assault.

Sadly, upon her death the corpse           of Lady Vox went &quot;poof&quot; and disappeared into the ether. Thus,           no loot was gained from the assault. The slaying of Vox was yet another           in a series of &quot;KEG firsts&quot; on the Rathe server. <br>          </font></p>        <p><font size="-1">On a similarly frustrating note ... after three hours           of wrestling with Paint Shop Pro the coordinate map of Fear Plane was           95% complete when it went the way of Lady Vox's corpse due to windows           fatal exception error (grrrr).

After fighting their way           through the perilous castle of fire giant guardians, our heroes met           Nagafen on his home turf and &quot;Barshed him gud!&quot;</font></p>        <p><font size="-1">The Knights of Eternal Good got the kill. Loot was           distributed randomly among all the participating guilds by random number           lotto. Corpses were resurrected (for the fourth or fifth time for some),           and our heroes went home happy with the knowledge that Antonica was           free from the ravages of this foul wyrm.
