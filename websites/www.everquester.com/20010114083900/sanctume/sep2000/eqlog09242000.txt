[Sun Sep 24 21:49:36 2000] Logging to 'eqlog.txt' is now *ON*.

Edit: So the server finally got back on and crap starts to hit that fan as 2 groups usually go for something, in this case Venril Sathir in Karnor. I would normally just let it go, but when my friend gets trained and killed when we get a foot hold of the so called race, and basically get bullcrap lies from the other party, it's time to push for beyond "fuck it."

[Sun Sep 24 21:52:14 2000] Qwai tells you, 'This is the real Qwai now'
[Sun Sep 24 21:52:33 2000] You told Stygar, 'Stygar is not online at this time.'
[Sun Sep 24 21:52:39 2000] You told qwai, '/tell Stygar tell your guys to bacjk off the vs cy. you're guild trained KEG and took over. this is NOT the fricking nagafen run'
[Sun Sep 24 21:53:13 2000] You told qwai, 'you don't want this messy crap in the server Qwai'
[Sun Sep 24 21:53:50 2000] Qwai tells you, 'We have as much right to this spawn as you man, we made the room 1st , its our spawn.......If you want, we can do it together.....We roll up front to see who gets 1st choice on loot.'
[Sun Sep 24 21:54:14 2000] You told Qwai, 'sure you do, but at the expense of killing our people from your train. is that how you are now?'
[Sun Sep 24 21:54:29 2000] Qwai tells you, 'I don't know what you mean...'
[Sun Sep 24 21:54:49 2000] You told Qwai, 'your guild trained KEG on the way to vs. it's pathetix and I wont stand for it'
[Sun Sep 24 21:56:03 2000] Qwai tells you, 'My officer Temporal was in her 1st had 2 mobs mezzed as backup arrived,.  Your sources are lying to you man.'
[Sun Sep 24 21:56:29 2000] You told Qwai, 'my proof is dead clerics from a train casued by CIW.'

[Sun Sep 24 22:02:08 2000] Vashon says, 'your members giving our members saying "Sorry we couldn't train you more" was not so good on your part'
