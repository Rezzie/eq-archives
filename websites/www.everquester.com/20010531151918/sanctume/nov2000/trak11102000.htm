            then gets up and makes a flying slam attack against Mills. Mills easily 
            dodges the attack and delivers a blow to Trakanon's stomach so far 
            that the human eye could not perceive him even moving! Trakanon, getting 
            up from the last hard blow, looks now scared at Mills - whose hair 
            is now standing up and glowing yellow. He stands still for a moment, 
            and the glow of pure power starts growing bigger by the moment. The 
            Dragon tries to flee! But alas, even as it got up upon its fores Mills 
            had finished gathering energy and threw it at Trakanon. The dragon 
            vaporized..leaving only the loot behind*</font></i></p>
