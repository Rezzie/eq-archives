      Today in KEG chat I interviewed Jerrica. I found out many insightful things, 
      including the fact that if I don't want to work hard, just interview someone 
      that likes to do something fruity like take off his/her pants:<br>
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> How close does your 
        character reflect your Real Life persona?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> We both have entirely 
        too much patience. One of these days we're both gonna snap and go postal 
        =P
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth: </font>Canadians with guns...how 
        utterly frightening.
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Where do you live and 
        play EverQuest from? 
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> A small igloo filled 
        town in Ontario (Canada for you geographically challenged people). We 
        don't have summers up here, it just gets a little slushy is all. My igloo 
        is heated though! 
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth: </font>Is it like Hoth where 
        if your droids turn up the heat too much the walls melt and you gotta 
        dry out all your clothes?
      <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> ...
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> How often does the normal 
        Canadian take off his/her pants?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> Depends, in my case 
        it should be how often other people take off my pants. /guildrude
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Somedays, funny just 
        comes up and smacks you in the face....
      <p class="keg">Mareth: What keeps you playing Everquest (besides cyber)?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> My guild. As long 
        as you guys keep cracking me up in /gu, I'll keep logging in. No pressure 
        or anything =P
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Whats the funniest thing 
        you've ever seen while playing Everquest (4 car pileups outside your computer 
        room window DO count)?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> Would have to be in 
        game stuff, since my igloo has no windows and we travel by dogsled up 
        here. Yuki's trains come to mind. In particular, the time he trained Innoruuk 
        on us in Maestro's room. Or maybe the time he trained Trakanon on us, 
        hmm no maybe it was the countless Draco trainings! Another.. is ...Duvlin. 
        He just ..cracks me ...up, ...period! (no pun intended).. Too many instances 
        to name, but everybody in KEG needs no explanation other than .... .. 
        ...DUVLIN DUVLIN DUVLIN! 
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth: </font>Anyone else think she's 
        making this too easy for me? Canadians...
      <p class="keg">Mareth: Describe Jerrica as best you can without boring our 
        audience.
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> Jerrica is Disney, 
        KEG is so not Disney! Jerrica is the druid who never forages, always gets 
        lost, gates people to the wrong locations, gates and leaves her group 
        behind her, group gates her group to the same zone they're already in, 
        never curses, snares herself constantly, rates the raunchiness of guild 
        /gu in terms of number of !!!!!!!!(tm)'s given, clericed nag/vox tank 
        groups and kept them alive with gheal!!. I've used the name Jerrica for 
        4 years in online gaming. Subspace, Starcraft, UO, and now EQ. For those 
        that don't know the origin of the name, it's from my favourite cartoon 
        as a kid, JEM! Ok I'm boring myself, next question!
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth: </font>Jem was kinda hot. I 
        used to watch it cause they had skimpy clothes and colored hair.
      <p class="keg">Mareth: If you had any questions for me, what would you ask?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> What do you wear under 
        your kilt, Mr Barb?
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Speedos, crotchless 
        panties, or strawberry flavored boxers depending on my mood.
      <p class="keg">Mareth: Ever fall off the cliff going to Highpass?
      <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> I probably would have 
        if I ever found it, I have this directionally challenged thing going on.
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Can I date your pet?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> Hands off the boo-boo 
        bear Charlie.
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> You can date mine...
      <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> I've heard a lot about 
        your pet....
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> If you ever cussed, 
        what words would you use?
      <p class="keg"> <font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> I blankety blank blank 
        cuss all the blankety blank blank time. 'Letter after E' Snubbles!
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Translation: I f%&amp;king 
        curse all the go#$%amn time. F Snubbles!
      <p class="keg">Mareth: Who's the most non-tool like person in KEG?
      <p class="keg"><font color="#990000">Jerrica:</font> At the risk of excluding 
        a whole bunch of non-tool like people, can I just call you the official 
        KEG tool?
      <p class="keg"><font color="#330000">Mareth:</font> Eh? Me? BAH! DAMMIT 
        BLAME CANADA! Screw you guys I'm going home!
