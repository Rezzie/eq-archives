          I have added a fifth group to accomodate guildmembers whose enrollments 
          I had misplaced. I have removed the cleric from the Pets Group to replace 
          with a necromancer. The Pets Group should have two Shamans, which will 
          hopefully suffice for healing. See the new <a href="Tactics/naggroups2.htm" target="_self">Groups

        <p><font color="#FFFF33" size="-1">We still need more clerics on standby.

        <p><font size="-1" color="#FFFF33">With the additional of a fifth tank 
          group, it will be tempting to try to kill Nagafen on the first attempt. 
          This must not happen. We must take Nagafen on the second attempt (or 
          third) to ensure that he is slain in his lair. We will not be giving 
          Nagafen the pleasure of going &quot;poof&quot; on us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" color="#FFFF33">On a final note, depending on the success 
          of the Nagafen raid, we may try to kill Vox afterwards. We have a technique 
          for seperating the Priest of Nagafen and cronies from Vox, and I am 
          confident that (based on our scouting attempt last Tuesday) that we 
          will have the firepower to take down Vox.</font></p>

          roles in these groups will be to resusciatate those who want a quick-rez 
          without exp, and to tank for particularly nasty CRs. Additionally, they

        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="-1"> &quot;The level 49+ is cutting out a lot of KEGgers 
            as well, and though I can't say that I am fond of the idea of not 
            being able to help on the raid, I do completely understand the rationale 
            for it. 2 most dangerous X factors when taking on dragons are LAG 
            and Dragon Roar. It is a known fact that less people = less lag thus 
            the reasoning for ONLY 6 groups. Secondly, level 50s have the highest 
            possible chance of resisting Dragon Roar...if you dont know how devastating 
            dragon roar is, I can tell you that in game. Needless to say, no chance 
            of resisting dragon roar means no chance of helping the group. Snaggle 
            and I have talked about the tactics and I have to admit they are very 
            sound.&quot;</font></p>
