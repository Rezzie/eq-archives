      <p>Today I go undercover to the world of Druids to interview the amazing 
        Autumnmoon! I've disguised myself as a bear to talk to her and see what 
        she REALLY is thinking.<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Since when did you start playing 
        EverQuest?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> October of 1999. *Yes, I'm a 
        noob =P* </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Uhh ya noob. Yer as much a noob 
        as Khistrich is cool. Err don't tell him I said that.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> If you had to do your character 
        over, what would you change?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> I would put points into wisdom! 
      </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> .... Lets not go there. Its a sore 
        subject for me. Moving on...</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Whats the most embarrassing thing 
        thats ever happened to you in EQ?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Uhhh...too many to count? Falling 
        out of the treehouses rates on the top of the list. Getting lost in just 
        about any zone imaginable is right up there too. Wondering for months 
        what the heck an SLR was and finally getting up the nerve to ask in guildchat 
        ;p </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Describe briefly Autumnmoon.<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> FRAGILE!!!!!</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> I agree. You kinda remind me of 
        Wembly. I'm more of an Uncle Travelling Matt tho.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> What are your views on Snubbles 
        and Soldierboy?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> RUN AWAY!! RUN FAR FAR AWAY!! 
      </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> If you could change one thing about 
        EQ what would it be?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Gah...that's a tough one. Too 
        many things..lemme think. The Verant Nerf Nazi's =P </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Any pet peeves?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Being inspected while sitting 
        at my bind point naked. Being called hun. Being asked for a port, zoning 
        there to find out they made a pitstop in town to buy supplies /whistle 
        /twirl /grumble</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> What is the funniest thing you've 
        ever seen said while in KEG?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Ignore the Dragon! </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Have you ever participated in stealing 
        Jerrica's pants?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Never! </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> You don't know what yer missing.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> What keeps you logging into EQ?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> My Friends! </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> What they got a gun to your head 
        or something? Maybe thats just my friends...anyway next question.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> If you had any question for me, 
        what would it be?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Is your online personality the 
        same as your real life? (that would be scarey)</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Yes IRL I'm dashing, suave and tall. 
        I'm hotheaded but damn kewl. Pretty close to Mareth.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Whats the largest train you've ever 
        pulled?<br>
        <font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> /hangs head in shame Far below 
        KEG Standards! Let's just say I'm working on it ;) </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> I've signed you up for remedial 
        lessons with Yuki.</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Have you ever fallen off the cliff 
        going up to Highpass?</p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Maybe ;p </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> THAT'S NO ANSWER! I WANT THE TRUTH!</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> I had a dream once that all I could 
        summon was this little pink toy poodle who kept trying to bite my ankles 
        and make love to my cat. In your opinion, should I seek professional help? 
        [Autumnmoon] Most definately....I dunno, maybe the SPCA has some kind 
        of program for people with your kind of problem.</p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Whatever you do, stay away 
        from my boo boo bear! </p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> Wha?? You sayin I'm nuts? THAT I 
        CANT DATE YOUR PET? YOU AND DETOM ARE ALL ALIKE! THAT'S IT THIS INTERVIEW 
        IS OVER!</p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF">[Autumnmoon]</font> Good. I do have one more question 
        for you. Everone in KEG had me ask why do you act like such a tool?</p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000">Mareth:</font> @#$$@# I DO NOT! I'M LEAVING NOW!</p>
      <p>End. <br>
