        <p><font size="-1">Sorry for the delay in posting the Fear Raid list. 
          A number of RL events have conspired to limit my time to work on the 
          website. Here is the <a href="Tactics/feargroups1.htm" target="_self">Fear 
          Raid List</a>, which should include all the people who e-mailed me. 
          Additional Keggers will likely be coming, as well as three groups from 
          MFH, and a group from Shining Thread. Basically, we will attempt to 
          completely dominate Fearplane today through mass numbers. There will 
          likely be much lag and link deaths, which means we will be splitting 
          into two groups once initial break-in is complete. We will only attempt 
          break in with about 4 or 5 Veteran groups. This will help with lag somewhat. 
          The rest of the groups will follow once we clear down to the gate (this 
          should not take long ... bonks on wood).</font></p>

          future site of The Triad's Dragon raids). I need someone who is familiar

          if you are a member of the Triad who wants to help. Please note that 
          working on the Nagafen site will consume a large amount of time that

        <p><font size="-1">There will be a Triad sponsored Fear raid beginning 
          at 3pm on Saturday, December 18th. I have it on good authority that 
          Cazic Thule and the Dracolich will be alive and kicking prior to our 
          break-in. The raid will last approximately 12 hours, from start to finish. 
          Those interested in attending should note their Name, Class, and Level, 
          then send an e-mail to either <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">snaggle@everquester.com</a> 
          (for Keggers), <a href="mailto:sharak@everquester.com">sharak@everquester.com</a>

          (For CIWers). I would like to request that only fear veterans, who are 
          familiar with the north-wall break in procedure sign up for the event. 
          Those unfamiliar with this tactic usually end up having to log out of 
          the game for hours to await CR because they died in the wrong spot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1">I have updated the <a href="graphics/maps/fearsnag2.jpg" target="_self">Fear 
          Break-in map</a> to show an improved run route. The survivability of 
          running this route is about 40% compared to the previous 20%. It should 
          steer you towards the Tentacle Tormentors (they do not see invisible 
          players), and away from the Scarelings, Spiders, and Shiverbacks (these 
          will see you while invisible). This is the route I have run on the past 
          8 raids or so. I have always made it to the camp (sometimes I died there, 
          sometimes I arrived unseen and camped, but I have always made it). </font></p>

          in the secure members section. The map includes the rooms on the second 
          level. Additionally the map has an area for taking notes on locations 
          of static spawns. I would encourage Keggers to update the spawn locations 
          and e-mail them to me.</font></p>

          I have found that organizing these raids seems to alienate guildmembers 
          and soaks too much time which is already consumed by maintaining the 
          site (Snaggle needs to barsh more). I am going to encourage the other 
          two guilds in The Triad start organizing raids. Future raids will be
