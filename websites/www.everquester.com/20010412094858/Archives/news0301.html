<p class="keg"> A fun filled day today for the Knights of Eternal Good, still without guildsay sadly. We started off by running after a turtle in Iceclad, needless to say he didnt live long, he was quickly followed in eq heaven by Kelorek'Dar and Talendor, both who died in under 30 seconds. Word came then that the broken golem was up in fear. We ran in fear with the goal to clear it as fast as possible, all in all temple included it took us 100 minutes to clear the plane. After that the fight with the enraged golem followed, he had approx 150.000 hitpoints, so it took awhile, we were quite pleased to see the green oil drop Enik needed to complete his wizard quest (pictures to follow)! Congrats!

Today as all of you know is the big split day where we move from Rathe to	Zebulbub. What's that name mean? Apparently it's a god. To quote verant "not much is known about Zebizuberb. He is the god of mystery"	Is it just me or is that completly original? Go verant for creativity there. Yaahoo! That almost makes walking to the shark reef worth it. not really. 		<p class="keg">I'd post some real news if I had some but last night was just the calm before the storm. KEGZeb is in full swing now and we are	converging currently on the gates of  hell to stomp booty. Ok, That was completly stupid. I'm just filling space now.		<p class="keg">I would like to send an apology out to Aledark for not mentioning that with the killing of Gorenaire he completed his bard epic. 	He has gotten his golden fiddle and will make manmusic everywhere he goes! Grats Bro, Sorry.		  <p class="keg">Welp, thats all for me. I have to lay low. Snaggle is on the         hunt for me. I made a booboo and if I'm not careful he'll bust me back         down from NewsBarb to TardBarb. I do encourage all of you still on the         Rathe to post on our boards and let us know what we are missing. We still         love you.<strong><em> -- Khistrich the Barb</em></strong>      </td></tr></table><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><TABLE class=keg borderColor=#330000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=5 width="83%" align=right border=1>  <TBODY>  <TR>    <TD bgColor=#330000><STRONG><FONT color=#ffcc99>NEWS: March 20th, 2001,       10:00 (PST)</FONT></STRONG></TD></TR>  <TR>    <TD>      <P class=keg>Wow! What a nifty new page huh? Barb here with the first       update of the new KEG era. In honor of the new server we here at KEGNews       WHQ have enlisted the help of our very own Megwedariel to give the site a       makeover. And boy did she. We're still working out the bugs so feel free       to report them if any are found.       <P class=keg>It's been awhile since my last update. In that time KEG       raided the Sin City and it did live up to it's name. There's alot that       cannot be said here in this "disney" news, but I assure you that all the       rumours are true. I have been asked to give a quick rundown of the       happenings from my vantage. I have a ton of pictures thanks to Gazelle.       Too many to post, perhaps I will make a seperate link in the future. I       should start a new paragraph now.       <P class=keg>Silentone, Gazelle, and the Barb landed in Vegas a little       after 3pm Thursday the 15th. The Ides of March for those of you who care.       We promptly headed to the castle in the desert and met up with the gang.       We first ran into Snaggle, Midoc, and all the Plilo guys. If I forget       anybody, I'm sorry.. but it was a long weekend.       <P class=keg>We did the hang out in the room thing for awhile waiting for       people to show up. That night we headed to the Buffet inside the castle       where we all had an informal dinner. During which Yuki called me several       names. Mareth also was very insulting towards the barb. Thinking back now       on it I should have reached over and killed everyone there. That would be       unfair to them tho. Depriving anyone of myself is terrible.       <P class=keg>After dinner Mareth went off in search of his pr0n, as       Snaggle pointed out in an earlier update. We did not see him again until       late Saturday. We can only assume he found what he was looking for. Most       of Saturday I spent hanging out with Baktogib. Which was pretty cool. He's       a nice quiet guy who enjoys Soccer (thats football for you       Internationals). We finally ran into some people after awhile and went       down to annoy Cinexa and her kids. She had a room directly over the pool,       which was also very cool.       <P class=keg>Friday, we also headed to the Mandalay Bay that is near the       castle. I don't remember what transpired their other than to say I blame       Kulvarian. He pointed to a sign that said "Shark Reef". So we had a quest       to find it. Little did we know after 2 hours of walking it would cost $14       and we'd turn around. Jenhia almost passed out, which would have been ok       for me, I would have had a chance to carry her!       <P class=keg>We then headed to the KEGFeast around 6pm where we all got       together and mingled. There was an open bar and Plop took it upon himself       to finish off a whole bottle of something called "Capt. Morgans" if I       recall. He did it too. I tried to get around the dinner and annoy as many       people as I could, I feel I was unsuccessful however. The food was good,       well the main course was. The rest sucked. Desert was good too! Chocolate       icecream cake. mmmm..       <P class=keg>After the feast we headed over to gameworks where Yuki felt       it would be fitting to own people in Dance Dance Revolution. Tooting my       own horn I did go undefeated in the Tekken arena. Sanctumeo did put up a       good fight, I did have to teach him a lesson ya know. The girl who worked       at gameworks kept flirting with me too. I swear it. Doc said she wanted       me. Who knows..       <P class=keg>When gameworks was completed we headed back to the room to       mingle some more. I didn't see much of Sardain on the trip. Rumor has it       he was camping the craps tables. I could be mistaken. Saturday, I did       nothing. All day we couldn't find anyone. Silentone, Gazelle, and Myself       headed to the Aladdin down the strip and checked it out. It was decent.       Nothing as good as the Paris or Ceaser's Palace.       <P class=keg>I didn't get to hang with everyone I would have liked too and       get to know. I did however spend alot of time at the feast with Mr. and       Mrs. Surax. I had no idea either would be there but they are two very cool       people. It's like we're twins. Plop and Faldor are also thugs like myself       so that is way cool too. All in all I would say the raid was a success.       Kudos to Snags for setting things up and footing the bill til we all got       him the plat.       <P class=keg>In other news, as per Sanctumes update Trakanon and Gorenaire       were slain in a goodbye to the Rathe. That's not all however. After I       logged for the evening to put this nifty new page up the KEG nightcrew       raided CoM. In what turned out to be a not so fierce battle, Mjollnir's       epic was completed. Grats bro.       <P class=keg>This update is getting way long. I blame Squido for saying,       and I quote, "You need to use more detail in your updates". Spam her with       tells for this! I guess I will finish up now and head on out.

People were definitely in <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/backbend.jpg">rare form.</A>       <P class=keg>Everything went blurry about the time <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/SnuubleSmoke.jpg">someone</A>       broke out the stogies. Not to be outdone by Snubbles, <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/Stogies.jpg">Doc and I rose       to the occasion</A> and succeeded in burning our lungs out.       <P class=keg>At one point, those not hugging porcelain or underneath       furniture gathered for a <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/GroupShot.jpg">group       shot</A>. Mareth(middle) <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/scarymareth.jpg">finally       returned</A> from his quest for p0rn and disclosed the sordid details to       Yuki(left) and SinLaR (right).       <P class=keg>Selenar poses for this shot as <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/SelenSanct.jpg">Snacktome</A>       discusses the merits of <I>SLR /cyber</I> with a mystery guest from Cali.       <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/fantome.jpg">Fantome</A>       showed up as well, and was thoughtful enough to bring <A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/plopScratch.jpg">Plop</A>       some itch cream.       <P class=keg>After the banquet, a l33t gr00p of keggers converge on       GameZone for some "Dance Dance Revolution". Yukitraino, though pictured       here <A href="/Vegas/polished/bustAss.mpg">busting       ass</A>, managed to steal the show as he <A       href="/Vegas/polished/khistYukiDance.mpg">smoked       all challengers</A> who tried to best his lightning fast footwork.       <P class=keg>Mareth ran off earlier in search of p0rn, and has yet to       report back. We can only assume the worst. We have begun distributing       Budweiser bottles with Autumnmoon's and Arioc's pictures in hope these       missing persons will show up. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR clear=all><BR clear=all><TABLE class=keg borderColor=#330000 cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=5 width="83%" align=right border=1>  <TBODY>  <TR>    <TD bgColor=#330000><STRONG><FONT color=#ffcc99>NEWS: March 16th, 2001,       12:22 (Vegas Time)</FONT></STRONG></TD></TR>  <TR>    <TD><STRONG><EM>Snaggle's Travel Journal</EM></STRONG><BR>      <P class=keg><A target=_self       href="/Vegas/polished/FaldorSoup.jpg">Faldor</A>       meets us at the noodle shop.

OK! I'll update the news already. Leave me alone. Barb       has been under the weather recently and not felt like updating the news.       The harassment has become too much however and I have caved in. All day       long I get icq's, and ingame tells "update the news!" "update the news!".       Apparently my fans are everywhere. I didn't think they would stoop so low       as to harass me for an update. I thought maybe they would understand my       creative juices need to be replenished every so often. So here I am, out       of the basement, where I was sucking down some battery acid and recharging       my batteries, with an update.       <P class=keg>I guess alot has happened since we last met. Most notible is       that KEGforces banded together to take down that vile wench of a dragon       Gorenaire. Much fun was had even tho she didn't have any loot on her       worthwhile. She probably just passed it off to Talindor after hearing we       were comming her way. Maybe we should take him down? I'll have to see what       I can talk people into!       <P class=keg>A few epics were completed. Which is always a good thing. I       do not know offhand who got what but just know that soon all of KEGs 216       members will have epics. Wait, 217, someone made another twink paladin.       Congrats for all those with epics.       <P class=keg>Well it seems we are 1 day away from Kegas! I will update       tomorrow before I catch my plane out. Can't have a raid party without the       barb can ye? I didn't think so!       <P class=keg>Finally, I will post Mareth's latest interview with Cinexa to       shut him up. Yap Yap Yap. All he does. so, the link is below.. Enjoy and       get to know her like the rest of us do.
