        Knights of Eternal Good</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Restructuring, 
        Officers and the Golden Rule</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because the guild 
        is made of dynamic people, it is impossible for KEG to be a static organization. 
        For a long time we have had no solid rules and no solid organizational 
        scheme, as neither were really needed. We all know how much the guild 
        as a whole has changed, from a meager 12 people up to the 60ish active 
        we have now. From a group of friends killing the Lord in Guk, to an association 
        of members who go after ubers. A good many of us are all friends, which 
        makes us different from other guilds, but as in RL ya just cant get along 
        with everyone. Unfortunately this has become a problem, when feuding people 
        cannot find a solution among themselves, it spills over into the larger 
        organization. As a GM and leader of the guild it has kinda fallen on my 
        shoulders to carry this burden and fix it the best I can, something that 
        I don’t feel 100% comfortable with, but with some assistance there is 
        a solution to be found.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few things I ask 
        of the guild before I continue is this: if you disagree with something 
        or don’t like the way something is speak with me, I WILL listen just like 
        I always have (my email address and icq number can be found in the Member’s 
        message board); remember above all else I love my guild and all its members, 
        even though I get stressed out =P I care deeply about KEG and our continued 
        success.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Officers</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To build a strong 
        building, you need a trustworthy and sturdy foundation. For us as a guild, 
        this means officers and GM’s. Until now for the most part officers have 
        only had one purpose, to invite twinks so they could have guildchat; but 
        no longer is this their main role. Officers will now be the leaders of 
        the guild, the ones who maintain rules and order, and look after the general 
        welfare of the guild as an entity. </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
        of right now (May 15th, 2001)</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">KEG 
        has 3 GM’s:<br>
        <font size="3"><b>Yukitaro, Kazmeir, and Cedrik (me);</b></font></font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and 
        6 officers: <br>
        <font size="3"><b>Alkarn, Deemoness, Jerrica, Leahcim, Sanctume and Saxiff.</b></font> 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
        are other names that could be added here but this is the basis we are 
        gonna build from, if more are needed more will be added. People are made 
        officers for a reason; they have earned the respect of the guild. In addition 
        to respect everyone on that list is easy to talk to, if there is a problem 
        they all have genuine concern. What officers say goes, if there is any 
        questions concerning the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">actions 
        of the officers bring them to me or Kaz or Yuki, we will listen.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Golden 
        Rule</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are few rules 
        that could be made, but would be better to call most of them guidelines, 
        except when it comes to treatment of other members there is but one hard 
        and fast rule.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Rule #1:</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>No personal attacks 
        of any sort in guildgab or in guildchat. Implied or direct attacks will 
        not be tolerated. The officers on hand will make the distinction between 
        argument and attack. Violation of this rule will be straightforward. First 
        a warning via tells will be sent, the only warning that is given. Then 
        guild-removal, a sit down session will have to be had with a GM, the officer/gm 
        who removed and the person who was removed before they are allowed to 
        rejoin. A second violation of the Golden Rule will result in board and 
        voting privileges removed, and a full evaluation by the GM’s with the 
        input of the officers before reguilding takes place. A third violation 
        will result in permanent removal from all events and activities associated 
        with the guild. Lets hope it never comes to that, as I don’t want to make 
        that decision… ever.</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, that said, the 
        officers, me and the rest of the GM’s are gonna have a mandatory meeting 
        outa game on Thursday at 10pm est. I will relay to them what I expect 
        from them, and how deep of a commitment I have in retuning KEG.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Keep in mind that 
        other situations may arise, and we will deal with them as they come up. 
        I think that the golden rule will fix up 99.99% of the problems we have 
        had.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Me or another officer 
        will get in touch with each and every person on our roster to make sure 
        they have read the above post and understand the rules and what is expected 
        of them. At this same time all officer tags will be removed from the people 
        not on the list.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Above all we need 
        to remember this is a game, a hobby of sorts, but when it comes down to 
        it this is a social game and what you do to another player you do to a 
        real life person who like you is sitting in front of their computer trying 
        to have fun. No tolerance for personal attacks, direct or indirect, will 
        be condoned or overlooked any longer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Your GM and friend,<br>
        Paul</font></p>
