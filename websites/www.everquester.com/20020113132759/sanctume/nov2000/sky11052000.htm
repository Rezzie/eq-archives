          battle of all took place on Drake Isle. Here are some quotes by the 
          Knights:</font></p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><font color="#CC00FF">&quot;So, 
            all the drakes were dead and I see yellow worry wraiths! I was ready 
            as one of them was pulled to camp, then came 2 more, then came 3 more--all 
            6 of them! We beat on one down only to be chained CH by the others. 
            Some people were dropping dead and the battle still continues. Battle 
            res and cleric nukes and 2 more blue drakes join the fray! In the 
            end we rejoice for experiencing one awesome fight I have ever seen!&quot;

            battle with the 6 unline spirits and the 2 windrider drakes kicked 
            ass. Cant believe we pulled that off with em chain CHing.&quot; -- 
            Caladel</font></i></font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><font color="#66CC00">&quot;That 
            last battle was prolly my favorite I have even had! Battle Rez's going 
            on, Jumping back into the fray, buffless, but determined to pervail! 
            Guys.....omg that ruled. Outstanding job everyone.&quot; -- Saxiff

            submit to you, the KEG Sky strategy guide:<br>
            1) Begin at 6 PM EST. No, wait, 8 PM. Maybe 9. =D<br>
            2) Kill the fairies.<br>
            3) Own the azaracks.<br>
            4) Cry while being dispelled a bunch and /mourn your lost clarity 
            and hit point buffs. Kill eyes, clouds, and birdies!<br>
            5) Kill the splitting horsies and sphinxes. Charm and shrink a few, 
            just for kicks.<br>
            6) NAGATSUN! YUKITARO! KAZMEIR! NAGATSUN! SABASTION! NAGATSUN! Finally 
            get a buncha birds and kill em ALL! At once, of course.<br>
            7) BzzZZzzZzzZZzzZzzz!!!<br>
            8) oooh, look at the pretty blue one! OMG I AM ALMOST FELL OFF! SINLAR! 
            KAZMEIR! NAGATSUN! CALADEL! MARCYS! REYE! SINLAR! SINLAR! LEAHCIM! 
            KAZMEIR! k, all the sphinxes should be dead now. Hmm, those yellow 
            things can't be too tough.. CH, CH, CH, CH, CH, CH, OMG MORE PRETTY 
            BLUE ONES! CH, CH, dead dead dead.<br>
            A lot of fun, it was so much nicer to do it with confidence and without 
            much unneeded delay.<br>
