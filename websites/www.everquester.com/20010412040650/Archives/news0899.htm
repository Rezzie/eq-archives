          KEG Guild Meeting in Arena on Monday, August 30th, 1999, at 8:00pm EST. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>August 29th, 1999</u></b></font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">The big news is our recent revisit to the lair of the 

          Efreeti Lord Djarn. This time we took a few screenshots (<a href="../graphics/screenshots/efreet1.jpg" target="_self">picture1</a>, 

          <a href="../graphics/screenshots/efreet2.jpg" target="_self">picture2</a>). 

          KEG would like to thank all of the non-Keggers who helped in the monstrous 

          corpse recovery task (10 hours of bashing and death). In the end, we 

          vanquished Djarnn sending him back to his homeplane.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Voting on new guild members ends tomorrow. Please try 

          to get your votes in by then. </font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Also, I would like to announce a new contest. This 

          contest is open to KEG and non-KEG members alike. Send in a real life 

          picture of yourself (this can be a baby picture, a current photo, high-school 

          prom, or whatever). Readers are encouraged to guess the Everquest identity 

          of the photo. The first person to guess correctly will receive the notorious 

          KEG Spanking, as well as a nice item from the KEG vault. This weeks 

          submission comes from a rather corporate looking fellow who wanted me 

          to add his picture to the guildmembers section. Can you correctly guess 

          the identity of <a href="../graphics/memberpics/corp.jpg" target="_self">Mr. 

          X</a>? Send all submissions to <a href="mailto:photo@everquester.com">photo@everquester.com</a>.</font></p>

        <p><br>

          <font size="-1"><b><u>August 28th, 1999</u></b></font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I am now dual-wielding Mindspring and GTE-Net, so no 

          more &quot;sneaker-net&quot;. </font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Everyone should be voting on new members. To vote click 

          on the &quot;X&quot; in the upper right hand corner of this page. Your 

          Username and Password have been posted in the &quot;Membership&quot; 

          forum under the &quot;Voting&quot; topic. If you lost your Username/Password 

          or need to recreate it, please send <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">Snaggle</a> 

          and/or <a href="mailto:tekwila@everquester.com">Tekwila</a> an email. 

          While you are there check out the &quot;Events&quot; section and specify 

          whether you will be attending the meeting or not.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1"><b><u><br>

          August 27th, 1999</u></b></font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">The site crashed last night. This is due solely to 

          GTE having inept technical support, abysmal response time, and absolutely 

          no idea what software their own network runs on. I wont go into the 

          gory details. Needless to say, I plan on dropping GTE as soon as possible 

          and moving back to Mindspring as my personal internet gateway.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">The next guild meeting will be in the Arena. For more 

          details and to sign up, try out the new <a href="http://www.powerball.dk/KEG/members/event/">Events</a> 

          section.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Until I managed to divorce GTE, updates to the website 

          will be delayed by one day (as I use "sneaker net" to carry uploadable 

          files into work for uploading). </font></p>

        <p><br>

          <b><u><font size="-1">August 26th, 1999</font></u></b></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Tekwila has finished the voting system. Please read 



          his <a href="http://server2.ezboard.com:8080/fknightsofeternalgoodmembership.showMessage?topicID=6.topic" target="_self">post</a> 



          on the BBS for instructions on how to register your username and password. 



          You can access this new section by clicking on the &quot;Members&quot; 



          Icon (it looks like and &quot;X&quot;) in the upper right corner of 



          the screen. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">Those of you who were lost in the Rathe mountains the 



          other day when we killed the named cyclops, <a href="../graphics/oculyn.jpg" target="_self">Oculyns 



          Ogrefiend</a>, will be happy to know that Questor of Norrath has produced 



          a map of the <a href="../graphics/maps/map-rathemtns.jpg" target="_self">Rathe 



          Mountains</a>, complete with Map legend and coordinates. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">There are a number of posts in the General (public) 



          section of our BBS from non-guildmembers. I am happy to see that others 



          are taking an interest in the guild (whether for praise or condemnation). 



          I do not like seeing personal attacks on the BBS, though it makes for 



          interesting reading. Please reserve these for a more appropriate forum 



          (i.e. email or within the game).</font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">I updated the <a href="../links.htm" target="_self">Links</a> 



          page so that site will no longer appear within the KEG homepage frame 



          (this was never intended, but I happened to notice the behavior this 



          afternoon). I also updated some of the information in the <a href="../protected/members.htm" target="_self">Guildmates</a> 



          section. </font></p>



        <p>&nbsp;</p>



        <p><b><u><font size="-1">August 23rd, 1999</font></u></b></p>



        <p><font size="-1">I corrected a number of errors on the <a href="../protected/guildmates.htm" target="_self">Guildmates</a> 



          page, and updated some of the information (thanks for the updates Longan).</font></p>



        <p>&nbsp;</p>



        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>August 22nd, 1999</u></b></font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">Due to popular demand the General section of the <a href="http://server2.ezboard.com:8080/bknightsofeternalgood">BBS</a> 



          is now open for anyone to post (the password protection has been removed).</font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">I modified some of the information in the <a href="../protected/guildmates.htm">Guildmates</a> 



          section. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">I am waiting until Tekwila has everyone's UserIDs and 



          Passwords to open a link to the events section. If you haven't sent 



          in a UserID and Password to <a href="mailto:tekwila@everquester.com">Tekwila</a>, 



          please do so.</font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">I have added some &quot;Keg Confidential&quot; maps 



          to the <a href="../maps.htm">maps</a> section that include spawn location. 



          Anyone wanting to download the current maps and update them with spawn 



          points, please do so.</font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">Finally I have added a <a href="../links.htm">Links</a> 



          section to the website with popular EQ links. Its a little clunky right 



          now due to the non-standard logo sizes.</font></p>



        <p>&nbsp;</p>



        <p><b><u><font size="-1">August 20th, 1999</font></u></b></p>



        <p><font size="-1">I have updated the <a href="../protected/guildmates.htm">Guildmates</a> 



          section with additional member info. I still need about half the guild 



          to submit their character info and email address. </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">Next, we need to determine how we will vote for officers. 



          I am still looking for a good voting application until Tekwila produces 



          something from his magical hat of coding.</font></p>



        <p><u><b><font size="-1">August 19th, 1999</font></b></u></p>



        <p><font size="-1">Although many changes may not be noticeable, I have 



          completely reworked the website (about 1800 lines of HTML) to support 



          a frames environment. This will allow me to link to the pages that Tekwila 



          is programming without losing the structure of the site. You should 



          also see faster load times with the new frames version (depending on 



          how your browser cached the previous version). </font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">The next big project will be a voting booth. Thanks 



          to Mills I was able to update the <a href="../protected/treasury.htm">guild 



          treasury</a> with spawn locations. I also plan on putting some &quot;Keg 



          Confidential&quot; maps up soon, but currently am suffering from EQ 



          withdrawl and want to get some play time in.</font></p>



        <p><font size="-1">The big news recently is our sucessful raid on Kedge 



          Keep. We managed to kill the Great Pimp Meister Phingel Atroupos, and 



          have renamed the zone &quot;Keg Keep&quot;. He didn't loot anything, 



          as Kedge is not itemized yet, but getting to him was a great adventure. 



          For more info on this check out Snaggle's report, &quot;Kill Da Kedge&quot;, 



          in the &quot;Guild Events&quot; section on the <a href="http://server2.ezboard.com:8080/bknightsofeternalgood" target="middle">BBS</a>. 



          Here are some screenshots of the pimp daddy fishman himself: <a href="../graphics/phingel1.jpg" target="middle">shot1</a>, 



          <a href="../graphics/phingel2.jpg" target="middle">shot 2</a>, and <a href="../graphics/phingel3.jpg">shot 



          3</a>.</font></p>



        <p><b><u><font size="-1">August 17th, 1999</font></u></b></p>



        <p><font size="-1">As all who attended know, the guild meeting went 



            very well. We liberated two Ykeshas, at least two barbutes, some silversilk 



            leggings, and a number of serpentine bracers from the depths of guk. 



            Some of the guild issues still remain undecided. Hopefully this will 



            change as more people contribute to the bulletin board.</font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">I have added extra security to the BBS. Only registered 



            users may now access it to read posts. To become a registered user, 



            you must first use <i>the password</i> (the same one used for the 



            secure sections of this website). After you register, you can customize 



            your own password. Make sure you browser is set up to allow browser 



            cookies so that you don't have to re-login every time. If you dont 



            know, <i>the password. </i>Contact Snaggle or one of your other guildmates 



            in-game.</font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">As a side note, I added Mills, Tekwila, and Iegen 



            as BBS moderators since they seem to have a good grasp of the BBS 



            mechanics.</font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">I have an two updated maps to post soon (with spawn 



            spots -- thanks Mills) as well as an update to the guild treasury 



            (which includes the name and location of the spawns that drop rare 



            items -- thanks again Mills). Guildmates information will also be 



            updated soon. These I will try to get to tomorrow (Snaggle had a wild 



            night on the town tonight and must now crawl in bed ... ). Gud bashin 



            all!</font></p>

          <p><b><u><font size="-1">August 15th, 1999</font></u></b></p>

            Humor</a> a friend emailed me. </font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">Next, I have implemented a lot of changes to the 



            website. The <a href="../charter.htm" target="_self">KEG Charter</a> 



            has been added. The <a href="../protected/guildmates.htm" target="_self">Guildmates</a> 



            section has been added (this section is secure contact Snaggle for 



            UserID and Password). A members only section has been added (this 



            area is also secure). A link to the new <a href="http://server2.ezboard.com:8080/bknightsofeternalgood" target="_self">BBS</a> 



            has been added (we need to decided whether this BBS will work for 



            us). The <a href="../protected/treasury.htm" target="_self">Guild Treasury</a> 



            has also been added under the Members Only Section (secure document).</font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">I am still looking for submissions to the tactics 



            section. I also need you bozos to <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">email 



            me</a> (snaggle@everquester.com) with your character info and whether 



            or not you would like an Everquester email address. Tekwila is working 



            on some strange stuff as well. More info on that in upcoming posts.</font></p>

          <p><font size="-1"><b><u>August 11th, 1999</u></b></font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">I need a volunteer to write a tactics section. Basically 



            this would list Do's and Dont's of fighting in groups (example: No 



            area effect weapons when Mesmerizing) as well as general tips on how 



            to stay alive, tank, cast, work together with the group etc. This 



            section will be for new KEG members to brush up on tactics and learn 



            how to play nice with their fellow guildmates. We all know that KEG 



            fights better in a group than certain other guilds (names witheld). 



            We need to record these tactics for future generations of KEGers to 



            benefit from. So who is up to the challenge?</font></p>



          <p><font size="-1"><b><u>August 10th, 1999</u></b></font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">Is this text too small to read? lemme know. I fixed 



            the close button picture (which BTW does NOTHING yet ... hehe). I 



            added the zone maps (gratuitously stolen from other sites.... they 



            will be listed in credits :P). I have received email from Kithan, 



            Immac, and Mills. Still waiting for Yukitaro to send the guild charter 



            and his character info. I will be looking into adding a secure section 



            for members only. </font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">For those interested in the site, it is run on three 



            T3 connections (one is a backup) located in Fayetteville North Carolina 



            and leased through Advanced Internet Technologies. I have about 200 



            megs of space for the site, so we will not be running out of room 



            anytime soon.</font></p>



          <p><font size="-1">Next I want to add the link to the current KEG BBS. 



            So someone send me the URL for it.</font></p>
