      <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks 
        for the inquiry. We don't have a freeze on new memberships, per se. There 
        is no level requirement to be accepted into KEG. However, we do not accept 
        membership applications. KEG is an "invite only" guild. I reccomend to 
        those who wish to join KEG that they make a point to get to know a great 
        deal of our members. Party with them, adventure with them, etc. When we 
        do decide to invite new members, the guild has to approve the member by 
        85% margin. It is difficult to get into KEG. However, KEG members are 
        the best trained, best equipped, and most loyal of any of the guilds on 
        our server. KEG is a family more than a guild. A group of friends that 
        have come to rely on each other through thick and thin. I wish you luck 
        should you choose to pursue membership in KEG. Feel free to contact me 
        in game if you have any additional questions regarding membership. </font></p>
