        server, EverQuest.</p>
      <p>The discussion of the merge has transpired throughout the month of March

        in Norrath such as Miragul's caverns in Everfrost, Kedge Keep, and Watergoblin 
        stronghold under Lake Rathe.</p>
      <p>A formal ceremony will be held in the Arena on April 15, 2000. (R.S.V.P.) 
        Invitations will be sent via e-mail to all friends of the guilds. Not 
        all details of the merge will be made public until after the formalities 
        have been presided by The Rathe's own <b>GM Daruka</b>.</p>
      <p>This will be a glorious day for The Rathe! Everyone will know that this 
        is the MEGA UBER GUILD that will be in the position to OWN the upcoming 
        continent of Kunark. <b>Congratulations to everyone!</b></p>
