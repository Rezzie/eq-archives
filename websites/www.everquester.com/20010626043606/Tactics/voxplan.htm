        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>The Setup</u></b></font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font size="-1">The meeting place will be at the King Camp spot 
            marked on the <a href="voxmap.htm" target="_self">Vox Map</a>.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">During the formation of parties we will be clearing 
            the King Camp spot as well as the Ice Giant Diplomat, and the two 
            giants that spawn behind him.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once groups are formed, a warrior buffed with high 
            magic resistance, and Spirit of The Wolf (SOW), will begin pulling 
            all of the giants, Icy terrors, etc. between the King Camp and Vox's 
            Lair. We will pull through two cycles of spawns to spread out the 
            respawn rate. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once the giant respawn rate is under control, a 
            Monk with SOW and magic resistance buffs and a warrior with SOW and 
            magic resistance buffs will move up to the Monk FD spot (see <a href="voxmap.htm" target="_self">Vox 
            Map</a>).</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The Warrior should back up a few paces from the 
            Monk FD Spot in the direction of the King Camp and wait there.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The Monk will proceed to Nagafen's lair, open the 
            rock/door, and step inside. This should Agro all of the mobs within. 
            This will usually &quot;agro&quot; Lady Vox as well. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The monk will then race down to the ramp to the 
            Monk FD spot and feign death. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The warrior will wait until Vox is not in sight 
            (if she was pulled), then move up to where the monk is feigned dead. 
            He will allow whatever mobs are present (Hopefully the Priest of Nagafen, 
            but not always) to &quot;agro&quot; on him, then pull them to the 
            King Camp Spot.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The parties waiting at the King Camp Spot will kill 
            whatever mobs were pulled. During this battle the monk should remain 
            Feigned Dead.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">All party members in the Monk's group and the Warrior's 
            group should camp out. The monk should camp using the &quot;/quit&quot; 
            command. The reason for this is that it is highly likely that Vox 
            will be agro on the Monk and/or Warrior. And person who casts healing, 
            buffs, etc, on the warrior on monk will inherit this agro. If the 
            parties do not camp out, it is likely that Vox will appear at the 
            diplomat doors (or if she has somehow taken damage) begin summoning 
            party members to her lair.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Steps 4-10 should be repeated until all of the mobs 
            in Vox's lair have been pulled and killed. It is necessary to do these 
            as quickly as possible.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">All of the parties will proceed to the Staging Spot 
            (see <a href="voxmap.htm" target="_self">Vox Map</a>). They will have 
            5 minutes to buff before the charge on Vox.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">After all parties are prepared, the person staging 
            the Vox raid should begin a 30 second countdown to charging Vox.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Groups 1, 2, the Pets Group, and the Nuke Group 
            should charge the lair.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">20 seconds later Groups 3, 4, and any remaining 
            groups (besides CR Group) should charge the lair.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Vox must die on this initial charge. Unlike Nagafen, 
            the assault cannot be done in waves. This is due to the fact that 
            Vox heals herself much more quickly than Nagafen. It is also due to 
            the fact that corpse recovery, while Vox is injured, is almost impossible.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once Vox is dead, the group leader of the killing 
            group should loot the corpse. Once the Vox corpse is looted, all parties 
            must immediately retreat to the the King Camp Spot to avoid respawn. 
            There will not be time for mana recovery or resurrections within Vox's 
            Lair. Corpses of slain comrades must be dragged back to the King Camp 
            Spot for resurrection.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Loot will be announced and distributed per the <a href="lootlist2.htm" target="_self">Loot 
            List</a>.</font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>Corpse Recovery</u></b></font></p>
        <ol>
          <li><font size="-1">In the event of a failed raid, corpse recovery must 
            wait until Vox has regained 95% of her health. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once Vox has regained this health she will begin 
            running willy-nilly between her lair and the diplomat doors (just 
            before the King Camp Spot). While Vox it going nutty, the CR group 
            should make dashes into her lair to retrieve and drag corpses out.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">If there are any monks, necro's etc. that Vox is 
            still aggressive on, they should feign death and remain so throughout 
            the recovery. If a bard is in their group, they should disband to 
            avoid Vox going Agro on the bard (due to Bardsong).</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">The remainder of the Non-CR groups should camp out 
            and log back in, to reset the dragon's agro.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Once all corpses are recovered and resurrected, 
            the raid can begin anew. </font></li>
        </ol>
        <p><font size="-1"><u><b>Things Not To Do On A Vox Raid</b></u></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">Never use any offensive AE (area effect) songs, 
            weapons, or spells, during, before, or after the attack. There are 
            numerous mobs that dwell beneath Vox's lair (level 50+ polar bears 
            come to mind) that will be pulled if offensive AE is used.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Do not evac. Either camp out, or die and let the 
            CR team take over. All evac spots are too far from Permafrost for 
            the groups to come back together within a reasonable time frame. In 
            the event of crash, your party's halfling can be used as a flotation 
            device. </font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Do not wander in the area between the King Camp 
            and Vox's lair. There are many pitfalls in this area that lead to 
            underground caves chock-full of level 50 monsters ready and willing 
            to eat you.</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Do not fight Vox anywhere but in her lair. Fighting 
            Vox in any other location will usually result in her corpse going 
            &quot;poof&quot; (thus no loot).</font></li>
          <li><font size="-1">Do not complain if you die multiple times, this 
            aggravates others and lowers the morale of all groups. You knew what 
            you were signing up for, so take it in-stride.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font size="-1"><b><u>Notes</u></b></font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font size="-1">Dragon Fear spell is the biggest inhibitor to a 
            successful dragon raid. Due to this, only level 50 players will be 
            in the first 4 groups, and level 49+ players in the remaining groups. 
            These players have the highest chance to resist the Dragon Fear based 
            on their level, thus it is logical that they should be the ones in 
            the raid.</font></li>
