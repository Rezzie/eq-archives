        Based on the recent poll (Feb 2000), a great percent of KEGgers wanted 
        to see only a YES or NO option. (Note: I very much agree to this by using 
        the analogy of a "jury" where you as a jury may only vote YES or NO in 
        the end. By doing so, we give every member the responsibility to learn 
        about the candidate for themselves. In turn, we let every member have 
        the power to debate their vote to persuade or guide others who are undecided.)
