          is Saturday morning and Sanctume awoke longing for his usual shipment 
          of dwarven ale, which was nowhere to be seen. Ofcourse, the dwarf has 
          only been a high priest last Sunday, and he has not been back to his 
          home in the outpost of Firiona Vie. The past week was filled with hard 
          fought battles, and the grand day was just beginning; still, it hinted 
          challenge.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is great news 
          that Bard <b>Vashon</b> has completed his Test of Tone from the Plane 
          of Sky today. A scroll accompanied this describing the Mask of the Songbird 
          he received:</font></p>

          great day for rejoicing because the ranks of the Knights of Eternal 
          Good will be filled by friends:</font></p>

          <p><font color="#FFFFCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;On 
            Saturday, September 23rd, the Knights of Eternal Good and friends 
            gathered in the wilds of the Emerald Jungle to face a terrible foe, 
            Severilous. The green dragon strolled over the hills of the jungle, 
            unaware that his life was about to end. The charge was called, and 
            the Snaggle Maneuver(tm) put into play. Only a small number of our 
            comrades fell to his terrible breath and razor claws. It was a grueling 
            battle, but in the end Severilous fell to our blades and magicks, 
            his body nothing more than a rumpled heap on the mossy ground. His 
            corpse yielded one Runed Bolster Belt (Megwedariel), one Green Dragon 
            Scale (Snaggle), 2 Shields of the Green Dragon (Sanctume, &amp; unkown 
            at the time), and several spell scrolls (entrapping roots, demilich, 
            avatar and legacy of thorns). Congratulations to the Knights of Eternal 
            Good and friends for ridding Norrath of this beast.&quot; -- Megwedariel</i>
