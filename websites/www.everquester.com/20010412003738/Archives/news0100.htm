        <p><font size="-1">On Sunday January 30th, at 5:25AM EST, KEG and friends 

          defeated the Noble Dojorn in the Plane of Sky. The Noble Dojorn had 

          beaten us down all weekend (he makes Nagafen look like a Lizard Broodling), 

          but after hours of dedicated effort and many deaths we finally prevailed. 

          His loot consisted of Brass Knuckles and <a href="Items/efreetigreaves.htm" target="_self">Golden 

          Efreeti Greaves</a> (screenshots of the Brass Knuckles are forthcoming). 

          Congratulations to KEG and friends on another Rathe first!</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">It has been a while since the last update. Innoruk 

          has fallen once, Cazic Thule has fallen twice, and we have begun adventuring 

          in the Plane of Sky. I am working with Immac and others to get a complete 

          listing of sky quests, which islands drop which quest loot, and the 

          relative strength of the various Sky mobs. The plane of sky tactics 

          are being hashed out in our guild forums, and require further practice. 

          The Nagafen tactics are being reworked again, as are the Hate tactics.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">After over 50 entries, no one has successfully guessed 

          the identity of <a href="graphics/memberpics/santas.jpg" target="_self">Santa's 

          Little Helper</a>. E-mail all entries to <a href="mailto:contest@everquester.com">contest@everquester.com</a>. 

          Both Keggers and non-Keggers are welcome to participate in the contest.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">Since taking out the Noble Djorn seems almost impossible 

          for a single guild, I will propose that we make a Triad event out of 

          it. Pending no more crashes, we can either attempt this tonight or schedule 

          it for Friday evening (if organizing tonight seems too difficult).</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">The Knights of Eternal Good will be breaking into Fear 

          Plane on Saturday, January 15th. The raid will commence at 9pm EST. 

          The insertion will begin at 9:30pm EST and the cutoff time will be 10:00pm 

          EST. This will give us 90 minutes for CR and setup within the zone. 

          The event will last until approximately 6am EST. This will be a KEG 

          event, open to all KEG members and specific invitees. I would like to 

          request that any other guilds planning a Fear raid please coordinate 

          your raid with <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">snaggle@everquester.com</a> 

          to avoid trains and other problems that occur when more than one group 

          attempts Fear Plane.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">And now, back by popular demand, the latest Secret 

          Identity Contest! This week's contestant is a founding member of The 

          Knights of Eternal Good. Can you guess the secret identity of <a href="graphics/memberpics/santas.jpg" target="_self">Santa's 

          Little Helper</a>? Rather than having a set prize for the contest, the 

          winner will be allowed to choose any piece of jewelry from the KEG treasure 

          vault (a platinum diamond engagement ring comes to mind). E-mail all 

          entries to <a href="mailto:contest@everquester.com">contest@everquester.com</a>. 

          Both Keggers and non-Keggers are welcome to participate in the contest.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">The Triad will be hosting a Nagafen raid tonight. MFH, 

          CIW, and KEG please contact your guild leaders to sign up. We will be 

          adding fire giant loot to the <a href="Tactics/lootlist.htm" target="_self">Nagafen 

          Loot List</a> to avoid any future disputes over items.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I would like to thank Iegen for helping me out with 

          the BBS and the Members section. Also, kudos to Immac for mapping the 

          Dracolich wandering path, mapping the Cazic wandering path, and for 

          scouting other boards to gain valuable info on Fear and Hate mobs.</font></p>

          January 9th, 2000</font></u></b></p>

        <p><font size="-1">In an 32 hour marathon of epic proportions The Knights 

          of Eternal Good, in conjunction with The Triad, defeated Lord Nagafen, 

          Lady Vox, Dracolich, Cazic Thule, and Innoruk this previous weekend. 

          Our heroes paused only for a brief nap as they struggled relentlessly 

          to purge the Rathe Server of all dragons and gods. Sources say that 

          Veeshan himself granted one wish to this bloodthirsty band of adventurers 

          in exchange for taking some time off slaying his children. What did 

          they wish for? Food and water vendors set up in Fearplane and Hateplane, 

          of course ;).</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I have updated the <a href="Tactics/lootlist.htm" target="_self">Nagafen 

          Loot List</a> and the <a href="Tactics/lootlist2.htm" target="_self">Vox 

          Loot List</a>. I did, however, forget who received the last set of Drums 

          from Nagafen. If anyone remembers who it was, please e-mail <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">Snaggle</a>. 

          </font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I am working on publishing a new Hateplane plan, based 

          on our most recent forays into the zone. The Nagafen and Fear plans 

          will also be updated shortly.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I want to aplogize for my seeming recalcitrance at 

          answering e-mails lately. RL work, and the webpage work have been piling 

          up so that I have limited time to check the old inbox.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">I need to update the Nagafen Loot list to reflect the 

          loot gained on our most recent dragon slaying. If someone could please 

          e-mail <a href="mailto:snaggle@everquester.com">snaggle@everquester.com</a> 

          an official list of the loot obtained, it would be appreciated.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1">At 12:26PM EST 01/01/2000 the god of Hate, Innoruk, 

          was slain by the Triad and friends on the Rathe server. Although not 

          a formal event of the Triad, a great number of its members were present.
