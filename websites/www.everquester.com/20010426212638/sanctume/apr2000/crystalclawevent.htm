      <p><font size="2"><b><u>April 2nd, 2000</u></b> </font>
      <p><font size="2">Sunday, shouts accross the land, 'dragons!'</font> 
      <p><font size="2">'What dragons?' This is the question that rang throughout 
        Norrath. This news is worthy of further investigation indeed. Rumors were 
        heard that a blue dragon was sighted in West Commonland, a green dragon 
        was seen ravaging in the Innothule Swamps, and a black dragon terrorized 
        the people in Greater Faydwer.</font> 
      <p><font size="2"> The Knights of Eternal Good sent orders to scouts in 
        every city and have quickly obtained information that <b>Zavo`Zatanov</b> 
        was in Everfrost. The brief gathering led into Permafrost and eventually 
        to a confrontation with <a href="kivgor.htm">Kivgor Illbriar</a> who yielded 
        a much prized bone razor.</font> 
      <p><font size="2">The evening was young and we continued to accompany Zavo 
        to the Rathe Mountains. The rumored <a href="dragons3.htm">dragons have 
        revealed themselves</a> to everyone present: a <b>blue</b> <b>dragon</b>, 
        a <b>green dragon</b>, and a <b>black dragon</b>. </font>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Mayong Mistmoore</b> fought the three dragons which 
        climaxed the evening in a <a href="mayongbattle.htm">great battle</a>.</font> 
      <p><font size="2">After the dead dragons were ressurected, the night was 
        concluded by slaying the chosen champion of the scale, <b>Fernorn the 
        Scale Claw</b>, who was gifted by the aftifact, <b>Crystal Claw of Veeshan</b>. 
        <a href="thescaleclaw.htm">Congratulations Ferlorn</a>! </font>
