      <p align="left"><font size="-1">Monday, it was a rough start on the first 
        night of the raid. But things went smooth after the divine intervention 
        of a guide/gm help summon the derange wizard Majdar that kept going after 
        his corpse. The troops rallied and have slain Dracoliche for the evening.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="-1">Tuesday, the second night was well underway 
        until Cazic Thule announced that he will renew his realm within 30 minutes. 
        The knights thought it would be great fun to charge the god of fear with 
        along with half the population. Five minutes into the world's renewal, 
        a call to arms ended in carnage that was a sight to behold.</font>
      <p align="left"><font size="-1">The Knights of Eternal Good and friends 
        once more rallied to execute an efficient clearing of the plane of fear 
        within five hours--its goal slaying of Cazic Thule.</font>
