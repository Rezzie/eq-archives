 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">We are the Twilight Council, a guild unmotivated by greed or personal power. A guild whose purpose is to help all, no matter how great or trivial the need is. We are the hope of those who have none, lending our collective experience to all of Norrath. We are neither good nor evil, right nor wrong, as the Twilight Council believes that every individual must follow his or her own path. We take the risks of siding with those who are unpopular, unwanted, or 
unloved. We are the shadow's light</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">and the light's shadow. We are the Twilight Council.</FONT> <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+1">Purpose:</FONT> <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Members of the Twilight Council are the guides, and the saviors of Everquest, Prexus Server. Anybody may request our aid. No job will be refused<I>,</I> given a fair price for any services rendered to complete their quest. <I>Need help getting 
back to your corpse?</I> Can do. <I>Need brewing materials delivered to Faydwer?</I> No problem. <I>Need an extra sword arm against a hill giant?</I> Assuredly. <P ALIGN=LEFT>The Twilight Council is also dedicated to having at least one master in every trade skill. This will allow not only our members but also everyone on Norrath to get a good and fair price on any player made item.</FONT> <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+1">Objectives/Guidelines</FONT> <OL TYPE="I"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">
<LI>Establish a reputation as a guild providing Honest Help/Guidance/or Aid. </LI><LI>Provide advice for new adventurers. </LI><LI>Record anything observed, be it how to complete a quest, the ins and outs of a trade craft, locations of interesting places or how other guilds are behaving. </LI><LI>Any member will give aid to the best of their ability with the following guidelines: </LI><OL TYPE="A"><LI>Stay in character. Obviously evil characters will charge a higher (but fair) price. </LI><LI>
Be careful not to break the guidelines set down in this charter. </LI><LI>You don't HAVE to respond to a request. If you are busy elsewhere,.. refer the request to another member if possible. Use your best judgment. Obviously a Ranger from Surefall will not aid in the destruction or killing of bears and wolves. Once again, stay in character. </LI><LI>Don't let yourself be taken advantage of. Just because somebody wants help does not necessarily mean they deserve the help. (example... 
twinking, etc.) </LI><LI>Keep the guild leader or an officer aware of your general location whenever possible. This is most easily accomplished by taking off the role-play/anon tag… The color of your name does not a role-player make </LI><LI>Don't kill steal while saving someone. Make sure they want your help. </LI></OL><LI>Share all resources and loot with guildmates. This obviously applies more the higher level you get to. Don't overextend your resources, but give what you can. Use trade 
skills to the mutual benefit of everyone in the guild, giving them the cheapest price possible. </LI><LI>We will be staging events; everything from typical festivals to player run quests is currently under advisement. </FONT></LI></OL><P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+1">Etiquette:</FONT> <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Treat all fellow guild members with respect and greet them warmly whenever you may encounter them. First and foremost, help your guildmates before anybody else. 
Of course it would not be good etiquette to turn down somebody's request for aid merely because you happen to be adventuring with a guild member and don't wish to be bothered. Once again, use your best judgment. All members will treat all other guilds with respect. If a conflict with another guild arises, it is the job of the guild leader to determine the course of action. <P ALIGN=LEFT>Complaints against fellow guild members should be resolved privately between the members in question. If 
the members can not come to an understanding then it will be dealt with privately by the guild judge. You can not over estimate the importance of the word 'privately'. <P ALIGN=LEFT>Role-play your character. While speaking in old English is effective, it is not necessary. Merely avoid references to anything only a person in real life would understand while you are speaking publicly. While speaking in a group (/gsay) or private messages (/tell) you may talk in whatever format makes you 
comfortable. <P ALIGN=LEFT>Kill stealing will not be tolerated.</FONT> <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00" SIZE="+1">Secondary Characters:</FONT> <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">I would rather call twinks, secondary characters -- and for good reason: twinking means something else. <P ALIGN=LEFT>Twilight Council will support secondary characters in order to encourage more grouping between high level and low level members. Secondary characters also foster a better enjoyment of the game as 
you are not limited to the hunting grounds of a single character. <U>However, items should not be hoarded for secondary characters by playing with the primary</U>. What this means is that if I find ravenscale armor in Cazic Thule, and a guildmember or another group member needs it to complete their set, I am required to give it to them. Remember -- it's just your secondary character. Equip them gradually, the game is more fun when you help other people instead of yourself</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF"
