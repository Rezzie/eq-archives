Changing Zones in EthernalQuest Beta

Changing the zone you'll be in on the EthernalQuest Beta server can be 
accomplished, but with certain limitations.  The technique for doing so is as 
follows...

First off, make sure you're using a seperate copy of EverQuest.  What you'll
be doing leaves traces that Verant could easily detect, not to mention that
you'd be getting patched back by Verant all of the time.
The next step is to use a hex editor to open the file "eqgame.exe" located in 
the folder you're using to contain your emulator-copy of EverQuest.  For those
who just groaned, stop reading now and just play in the zone Ashran has it set
up for.  This is NOT hard.

Now, scroll down to offset 01748664 (001AAEB8 in hex) or do a search for 
"qeynos.wld".  The offset will change with Verant's patches to eqgame.exe, but
searching for qeynos.wld will always work.  The offest above is current as of 
July 11th, 2000.

Next, overwrite (NOT INSERT!) at this spot the filename of the zone you want to
use.  Here's where the limitation I mentioned comes in.  The filename for the 
zone you want to use must not exceed 7 characters in length.  This means you'll
have to choose from the zones listed below...

akanon
arena
butcher
cabeast
cabwest
chardok
commons
cshome
dalnir
droga
firiona
grobb
guktop
halas
hole
kaesora
karnor
kedge
kurn
load
misty
najena
neriaka
neriakb
neriakc
nro
nurga
oasis
oggok
oot
paineel
paw
qcat
qey2hh1
qeynos
qeynos2
qrg
sebilis
skyfire
sro
tox
unrest
veeshan

So, if you wanted to use Sunset Home as your default zone, you'd overwrite 
"qeynos.wld" with "cshome.wld".  If you wanted to use the Ocean of Tears,
you'd overwrite "qeynos.wld" with "oot.wld" followed by three nulls (00 in hex).  
Also overwrite "qeynos.s3d" with the same filename (Sunset Home would be 
"cshome.s3d").  By the way, I think the above list is complete, but it might 
not be.

Next, rename the .s3d file that is currently being used by the emulator (it is
"veeshan.s3d" as I write this) to a .bak file (or whatever else you want).  So,
"veeshan.s3d" becomes "veeshan.bak".

Finally, start the emulator login program!  When you make your character, 
you'll see that the "CURRENT LOCATION" is still whatever Ashran has it set to,
but you WILL log in to whatever zone you chose through the method above.  
Here's where another tiny limitation comes in...  The available shapes will 
still be the ones for the zone Ashran has it set up for, NOT the ones for the 
zone you chose.  Sucks, I know, but that's the way it is.

Now, for those of you who decided to read all of this, here's something totally
unrelated, but VERY handy, nonetheless.  Save the file at
"http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/commands.txt" over your "everquest_manual.txt"
file located in your emulator-copy of EQ.  Now when you press the "HELP" button
in game, it'll bring up a shape list :).  Use PgUp and PgDn to navigate it.

That's all you need to know.  I'll be sending this file to several sites for 
possible upload (filename will be "Changing Zones.txt"), as well as posting
it in it's entirety on the HackersQuest emulator forum under "How to Change 
Zones".

One last thing:  The seven character limitation can't be overcome in any way
I can come up with.  This includes renaming the .wld archive in the .s3d to 
something shorter using EQInside and referring to it in eqgame.  Not sure why 
that doesn't work, but it doesn't.

Please do NOT contact me with questions at my email address.  I don't want to 
be flooded with "IT DOESN"T WORK!!!!" messages when I know it does.
