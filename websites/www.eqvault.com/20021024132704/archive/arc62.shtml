Logging some more time on the Gameplay Board this evening, Alan wrote and posted the following messages:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038698.html"><b>Answering Questions on UI</b></a><br>What swe135 is saying (in a less than polite way...) is that I have answered those questions. <br><br>Probably the best place to find answers to your concern is here: <br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037429.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037429.html</a><br><br><br><br>And you can always search for my name to look and see what I've been prattling on about&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038695.html"><b>More Downtime</b></a><br>Well, we're doing our best to minimize the impact of these patches. But they are necessary, or we wouldn't do it. I'm sorry that these things are inconveniencing our customers, that's never our intent. <br><br>Honestly, this release has been much smoother than Ruins of Kunark. The problems that we are encountering have rarely been devastating. And considering the shorter production time on this product and the ambitious nature of the product, I think we've done a fair job. <br><br>We certainly wanted the release to be flawless. It wasn't. But we're getting closer each time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038693.html"><b>Item Inspection Window Name</b></a><br>My guess is that it's these entries: <br><br>ItemDataWinY=225<br>ItemDataWinX=200<br>ItemDataWinH=150<br>ItemDataWinW=400 <br><br>There should be one set for each resolution. <br><br>But I'm not Rowyl, and he's not at his desk at the moment... so use at your own risk.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038136-3.html"><b>Nerfed SoV Items</b></a><br>This was, by no stretch of the imagination an injustice to anyone. <br><br>We changed the weapon into something that was appropriate for the creature that it dropped from. The item that was dropping there shouldn't have been dropping. <br><br>We corrected our mistake. <br><br>Leaving it as it was would have been the greater injustice. It would have promoted the idea that getting the expansion first entitled a player to items that they gained due to an error in our data. <br><br>I can't comment on the reasons for past actions about matters like this. I personally feel that this is the proper response to this situation. <br><br>I am sorry that we had to change that item. It wasn't done to anger anyone. It was done because it should have been done, to keep things in balance. There was no intent to 'bait and switch' anyone here. Yes, we missed this problem, but we fixed it as fast as we could. I'm sorry if any of you had your items changed. <br><br>Msully wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "&#8230;but did they have to rub your nose in it?" ]></i></font><br><br>Actually, we were rubbing our own noses in it&#8230; <br><br>Axterix said: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Verant can't win in this sitaution, really." ]></i></font><br><br>That's pretty much true. We made an error. We can't make that go away. So the choices are to anger people by leaving the item as it was, or to anger people by changing it. <br><br>Leaving it as is does not correct the situation. <br><br>Changing them does. <br><br>In cases like this, we should always choose to correct the mistake, not just ignore it by leaving the broken items in the game. The Griffon Sword was intended as a top item off a top mob. Leaving it in would have made getting it in the appropriate way pretty worthless. <br><br>Again, we're sorry for the change for those that got those items and had them changed. But we felt that was the best thing to do for the game as a whole.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038650.html"><b>Another Corpse Dragging Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Let's say two characters are both warmly to the Kromzek and Kromnik factions. Neither are actually fighting giants, or doing anything whatsoever to upset giants. One falls victim to a trap and dies. Why, in such a case, would the giants object to a corpse dragging?"]></i></font> <br><br>Actually, a better way to set up your example would be to say that he'd fallen to his death on accident. If he was hit by a trap then he would probably have been someplace that he shouldn't have been (that's why there's a trap there, silly!). <br><br>The answer in both cases would be yes. <br><br>Those cases should be very rare. But they will happen. From a roleplaying standpoint, yes, it's not the best. But from a gameplay standpoint it works best that way. <br><br>If the person is not hated by the folks that reside near his corpse, then he/she will have little problem getting it back on his own. <br><br>Alan (oh, and yes, I have answered this question before&#8230; :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038657.html"><b>Absor Keeps Answering Too Many Questions</b></a><br>Sorry. <br><br>That wasn't a question, right?

There probably never will be. <br><br>Have you tried the new discipline? <br><br>It is less resistable with the new discipline than it ever was. And it is very unlikely that we will ever make an offensive ability or spell unresistible (or should that be irresistible?).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/038542.html"><b>"Water cannot drip from a stalagmite to a stalactite..

There just wouldn't be anyplace to put them. <br><br>Yes, that could become a problem in the future. The team is aware of this (and I'll make sure they don't forget, unless I forget&#8230;), and I'm sure they'll figure out a solution before too long.

The only reason that someone would drag off a corpse would be to restore his life. Friend or not, that NPC doesn't want you to do that. Just because you are a friend of the NPC and the dead guy is your friend, that does not make the dead guy the friend of the NPC. That is an illogical conclusion. <br><br>But the real reason for the corpse dragging thing is because people could use this feature to bypass parts of the game that a feature isn't supposed to let them pass. The choices were, basically, remove the feature entirely, never implement interesting new gameplay that the feature would make worthless, or modify the feature.

These changes will go into effect with the emergency patch (though this is not the reason for the patch, just something that we are slipping in while we're at it).<br><br>Resistant &#8211; At 30th level the resistance gain will be +3. This will increase at increments until 50th level, where it will reach its maximum of +10.<br><br>The Ranger True Shot &#8211; The chance of hitting with a bow while using this discipline will increase, along with the other benefits.<br><br>Shadowknights Unholy Aura &#8211; along with the 25% increase in damage, this discipline will also make the Harm Touch less resistable, along the lines of a Lifetap resistance.<br><br>Paladins Holy Forge &#8211; the ability to critical with this discipline in use will be doubled. It will, of course, still only affect the undead.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

It turns out that, because these were created before the ability to gain levels beyond 50, these resistances were not being calculated properly for most classes as they passed level 50.<br><br>This means that, once this is fixed, all classes with these resistances will see an increase in their innate resistance bonus that may be as high as 11 points.<br><br>The exception is warriors, whose resistance bonus was working just fine.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

This means that those of you with Velious accounts can't take screen shots right now. We will turn them back on with the patch this Thursday. <br><br>Sorry about that&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037426.html"><b>Inaccurate Info on SoV Box</b></a><br>Yes, we noticed that too... a bit too late.

That's true. We also believe that having that many subscribers does indicate that a lot of people are enjoying the game. The only place where your figures were correct (actually, a bit high) is when you calculated that about 76,000 people are playing EverQuest during peak hours. I think that's a pretty large number, and that alone indicates that EverQuest is a successful product. <br><br>And, yes, we think that EverQuest is a great game full of good challenge, content and expansions. <br><br>As for those that are anticipating the 'next big challenge'&#8230; I was just at an EB today that had sold their 120 copies of Scars of Velious in only a few hours. <br><br>I had nothing to do with the building of the game. If I had, though, I would be extremely proud of that kind of response from the customers. I think the team has created a great product.

William reminded us that before playing Velious you should considering patching your client:<BLOCKQUOTE>You might want to let folks know that right after they install Velious, they should hit the new Velious Patch button.  There is about a 7M patch waiting for them.  <br><br>It only patches though if you hit the Velious Patch button.</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the tip.

A new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml">Producer Letter</a> is up on the official site.  Written by Velious Producer Jeff Butler, this letter announces that Velious is officially launched:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>On behalf of the entire EverQuest Team past and present, and everyone here at Sony Online Entertainment, I proudly announce the launch of the second EverQuest expansion - The Scars of Velious. <br><br>Created in little over half the time of the previous expansion, and with a significantly larger development team, The Scars of Velious adds 19 challenging new zones to the world of Norrath, including two new Planes. In addition to the new zones, Velious includes over 150 new armor textures, helmets, and weapons for player characters, and an enhanced user interface. Also introduced are many new creatures and monsters, most notably the Coldain dwarves, Giants, and Dragons of Velious. The expansion is specifically designed to challenge the majority of EverQuest players, who are between 30 and 60th level of experience.<br><br>It seems that just a short while ago that I had the pleasure of announcing the launch of the first EverQuest expansion. Our desire to surpass the success of The Ruins of Kunark spurred us to set ambitious goals for The Scars of Velious. As the months of development passed the team overcame what seemed at the onset to be a daunting series of challenges, not the least of which included a tight schedule. We are humbly pleased to present The Scars of Velious without compromise or concession, and we hope that it meets and exceeds your expectations for value and quality in an EverQuest product<br><br>Returning for the second expansion were several experienced members of the original EverQuest and Ruins of Kunark teams. Their expertise combined with that of the veteran EverQuest Live team, made this challenging project possible, and allowed us to take this expansion to a new level of immersive detail. I would like to personally thank them for their unfailing dedication to excellence. It has been an inspiration and an honor to be a part of The Scars of Velious team.<br><br>We encourage you to be among the first in the unfolding history of Norrath to board the amazing Gnomish Icebreaker ship and venture to the frozen continent of Velious. There you will be exploring a land where no adventurer has ever before set foot, where you can choose sides in the struggle between titanic forces locked in an ages-old conflict and view wonders never before seen by the inhabitants of Norrath.<br><br>We expect that the launch of The Scars of Velious expansion will proceed smoothly, but we will maintain our Customer Service staff here at Sony Online Entertainment around the clock to insure that everything performs as expected. As we anticipate customers in record number over the next few days, we ask for your understanding should any problems arise. We will do our utmost to resolve any issues quickly, and with a minimum of downtime or inconvenience.<br><br>In closing, I would like to again thank our loyal players for their support. The ongoing development of EverQuest and its expansions has been a profound pleasure for all of us here at Sony Online Entertainment, and we hope that you will join us in The Scars of Velious, and as EverQuest&#8217;s future unfolds. As always, we look forward to seeing you in game.<br><br>Welcome to EverQuest: The Scars of Velious! You&#8217;re in our world now!<br><br>For the EverQuest Team<br><br>Jeff Butler<br>Producer<br>EverQuest Live and EverQuest: The Scars of Velious</i></UL>

I'm starting to receive reports that the Scars of Velious has been spotted at retail stores across the country.  For those who didn't preorder it your best bets are to stop by Software, Etc., Best Buy, Circuit City and other similar vendors.<br><br>I'll try stopping by my local software source to see if the anticipated expansion has even reached the "rural" areas of the country. ;)

Brad McQuaid made several comments about the Scars of Velious expansion recently on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037021.html">a thread located on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><I>Just letting everyone know that Scars of Velious should start to appear in US stores tomorrow, and be in most stores by the end of the week. <br><br>I'm not sure about outside of the US, but we do have much better distribution now. I'll try to find out. <br><br>-Brad <br><br>ps. If you have any Velious sightings, feel free to post them on this thread :)</i></UL>Follow-up post #1:<UL><i>For those in San Diego, remember the team will be at the EB in UTC on Wednesday to say hi, sign boxes, give away posters, etc. <br><br>See you there :)<br><br>And stevemorley, yep, I've been shown quite a tour through the varous zones in Velious, and it's pretty darn amazing stuff :)  I think the teams have really outdone themselves this time. <br><br>For example, I'm really happy to see traps! (Especially after having so many Rogues upset with me for so long :)<br><br>Also, wow, are there some great stories and quests! We've seen a lot of posts asking for more stories, more RP, and more depth... well, Velious is a HUGE step forward in that direction -- there are all sorts of new scripted events involving players and NPCs using some advanced AI enchancements we managed to get implemented. <br><br>I can't wait to hear what you all think :)<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>Here's follow-up post #2:<UL><i>Tiervalen: Essentially, the majority of our player base is heading into their 30s, and with the backstory of Velious describing it as a pretty nasty and exotic place, we decided to make the expansion targetted for levels 35-60. <br><br>One could also argue that new players and casual players (for the sake of argument, those below 35 I suppose) still, by definition, have tons of already existing content to explore and devour. <br><br>All that said, I definitely hear what you're saying and it's also a concern on our part (we definitely want to provide new content for ALL EQ players, new or old, casual or hard core, RPers or power gamers) To that end, we've both short and long term goals: <br><br>We still have quite a few dungeons to revamp, and those include low, mid and high (including the planes). With Velious in stores tomorrow, you'll see the Expansion and Live teams move on pretty quickly to these revamps (although there will undoubtedly be some clean up and we do have the holidays approaching). <br><br>Also, I'd like to see at least one (perhaps two) new free zones launch during 2001, and I think we should focus on low to mid levels. <br><br>And lastly, should there be another expansion post-Velious (and while I'm certainly not announcing anything... well, with 310,000 subscribers and growing, I see a long future ahead of EQ :), we'll most likely target all levels (1-60), similar to what we did with Kunark. <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

Brad quickly responded to a post concerning the status of MIP Mapping.  The <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/037080.html">following is his complete response</a>:<UL><I>With the last patch (or maybe the one before that), we decided to turn off mip mapping for everything but the world (in other words, it's not on for characters and objects).<br><br>We did this because mip mapping all those textures was causing performance problems and pauses for many players. That, and we really think subjectively that the advantages of mip mapping are for the most part apparent and beneficial only on world geometry.<br><br>That said, you seem to disagree. We'd love to hear some other feedback on this. Perhaps we could provide several options (for example, no mip mapping, mip mapping world only, mip mapping all textures) were there a demand. <br><br>Let us know, and maybe Rowyl can look into it and let us know if such options are possible.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>
