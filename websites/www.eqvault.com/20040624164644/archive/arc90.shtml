Further addressing the topic of "Too many patches," Gordon posted the following in another thread:<UL><i>Would you prefer that the game never be changed? No more quests, no more items, no new areas, no more fixes, etc? <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Now if only for the shake living up people's mornings, I've started a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6565107&start=6565107#6565107">special Player View Discussion Thread</a> on our <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5001">General Board</a>.  The purpose of this thread is to share thoughts and ideas on how to make downtime more painless.<br><br>People have a right to be somewhat upset with all the recent downtime.  By my rough estimate the servers have been down for over 26 hours alone this month.  (and that's using the estimated downtime, not always the actual downtime experienced)  At the same time Gordon has a very valid point, EverQuest would be ruined if it was not properly maintained.  <br><br>Some initial thoughts and suggestions come to mind:<br><UL><LI>Give people more than 24 hours of advanced warning - It stinks to suddenly have to deal with downtime.  Announced it a week a head and post a few friendly reminders.<br><LI>Compress the downtime - Aside from non-emergency, game threatening issues have a regular "Patch Day" on a specific day of the week/month.  That way people will learn to better work around it. </UL>Feel free to jump on the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6565107&start=6565107#6565107">thread and post your thoughts as well</a>.

Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn talked about the flaming/bashing going on the Boards by people who believe Verant favors certain classes.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007016-2.html">the post he made</a>:<UL><i>Can we stop this "Abashi favor's necros" bs? It's childish to assume that because I play one that I would drive the enhancement of the class. You guys want people here who play the game, but when we do, you assume that there's some class favoritism going on.<br><br>Shortly after I got here everyone was screaming about how "Brad plays a Ranger" and how they were the "favored" class. <br><br>I'm lucky if I can play my necro 4 hours in a week these days. I've made 4 levels in the past 9 months. I'll never see 60th level as I'm not in it to level these days. I have only one necro-specific item and it isn't even on that list (Harvester). I've refused to consult on most issues related to the necromancer in house (except for nerfs, which I've usually been the driving force behind). I don't really plan to go after any of these items on the list, and I told the game designer who's working on some really high end quests for all of the classes that I wasn't interested in helping with the necromancer one.<br><br>What could have been a good discussion fades into yet another thread about how we must have some deviant plan to hurt your class or favor ours. We don't play the game on "god mode", create items out of thin air for our characters, or run around trying to slip through enhancements for our classes. <br><br>Please stop posting this garbage.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>P.S. My apologies to anyone in the thread who didn't jump on that bandwagon.</i></UL>

Gordon answered a post wanting to know why another patch was quickly announced and implemented early this morning on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>We've been making so many changes lately, particularly the changes related to the enhancement of the EverQuest client, that we need to get them online for player use. Sometimes newer changes are dependent upon getting existing changes in game, so that player feedback can be obtained and the ideas refined. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

I noticed on <a href="http://www.eqanswers.com">EQAnswers</a> that <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/news/966993848,87801,.shtml">Smedley wrote some of his thoughts on expanding the MMORPG market</a> at Lum's.  It's a good read, particularly for those who of you who are interested in the business side of MMORPGs.  Here's a blurb:<UL>3) During our peak hours, we're seeing around 62,000 people playing at the same time. Even more interestingly we're seeing our MINIMUM number of people rising to around 16,000 people. That's EXTREMELY important for the financial success of these games. Bandwidth is priced by the Peak Usage, so we're paying for peak usage even in off-peak times. That's why International growth is so important due to the different playing times (i.e. the UK's peak time is different then the USA's).</UL>

Gordon has posted more to the Gameplay Board this evening.  Lets get caught up:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006993.html"><b>Thousands of Twigs/Whips?</b></a><br>I would think that the sheer number of people here on the boards complaining about it illustrates that there are far more in game than some here think. I've seen dozens of people complaining about it, and considering the percentages of people who post on the boards, the number in game can be extrapolated. <br><br>Let me ask a question: Can anyone here say that those weapons are appropriate equipment for the mid-30s?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007146.html"><b>Unique Quests</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive read a lot of the recent discussion about camping and item drops and I wanted to propose an idea I have had for awhile now. The proposition is to have in game quests which follow that same layout as current quests do but instead of being constant, they can only be completed one time only ]</i></font><br><br>I assume you mean once per server rather than once per player. That's probably not something that we would do. We'd rather that one-time quests be handled on a dynamic basis, with actors playing the NPCs present in most of the quest. They involve many people overall, trying to get the biggest "bang for the buck". <br><br>It wouldn't be a very good use of time to have several game designers spending a week or more of their time to input a quest that operates in the standard way, only to have it enjoyed by 3 dozen people.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007149.html"><b>Verant wants us to die more?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Every patch seems to either make dying easier or gaining exp harder with a net result that it takes a very long time to gain 1 bubble of exp never mind 1 whole level!]</i></font> <br><br>I'd say that very few patches do either, really. Perhaps if someone is dead set on camping one fast-spawning NPC, and we change the spawn time on that NPC, that might be construed as the former, but we're just trying to inject challenge into the game. <br><br>Every day people post here on the board that the game is "nothing but camping" or "nothing but hack and slash", yet that is all they choose to do while in game, when there is so much more there. These same people spend 12 hours per day in game doing what they come here and complain is boring. We're just trying to remove what is being cited as boring. Now obviously we can't please everyone in this process, for instance, those who wouldn't be happy unless there was absolutely no downtime of any kind, yet we have to try to address the issues that we can. <br><br>Just to answer your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do you want us to all die Abashi (Verant)?]</i></font> <br><br>The game should be fun. One of the ways that the game provides fun is to provide challenges for you to overcome. Challenges require risk to be meaningful. The risk in this case is the chance of failure. The penalty for that being death. <br><br>If there was no death then there would be no risk which means that there would be no challenge and thus no fun. The FAQ explains this in more detail.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007150.html"><b>Why Ban Players</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why not "Exile" their accounts to a "bad boy" server. Disable their account from access to anyother server, and transfer their chars to the new server.]</i></font> <br><br>A server really has to have a minimum number of people on it before it breaks even in terms of depreciation and operations. Certainly we'd save some money from an operations standpoint by not having to provide GM support on a server of this nature, however it would have taken so long to populate the server that it would never have been profitable.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't know, Abashi. If you ban the bad boys and morons, I think a new server would fill up real quick.]</i></font> <br><br>We might be able to get rid of more of your averagely anti-social people (KS, ninjalooting, etc.), however 75% of the GMs' time these days is taken up investigating scams of one kind or another. Maybe if these slow down a bit... <br><br>It might sound strange, but 90% of GM and Guide time is taken up by 10% of the playerbase. It's the same 10% daily. The real problem here is that when someone in the other 90% needs help, they are often in line behind several people of the 10%. <br><br>That's why we've posted from time to time that certain issues shouldn't be petitioned while in game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007152.html"><b>Guild Logo</b></a><br>Though this is a great idea that we'll certainly keep in mind for the future, it's not something that we would see in EQ for technical reasons. This is explained pretty well in the FAQ.</UL>

Here's why: I think the server only sends players information about other player's locations on some time interval that I am really not sure of.]</i></font> <br><br>That would be correct. The problem that you are mentioning has to do with the fact that NPCs are far more predictable than players, and data outside a radius around the player is based off of prediction. Data within the radius is updated more often, but that outside gets old. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Purposed solution: Send *group* member&#8217;s location information more often.

Though coin-only people might be in the majority there, there are enough people who want item loot across the servers that their wishes should be addressed as well. Item loot makes more sense on Rallos due to the reduced level-range for the purpose of PvP. <br><br>The fact also remains that people who chose to play on Rallos did so knowning the item looting rules, and it's been basically the same since release. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3.

Is it possible to have player made wedding rings made into No Drop status so that we can keep our wedding rings from being looted? ]</i></font><br><br>This is one for the wishlist. There are all kinds of things that we can do with items, and a lot of suggestions have merit of one kind or another.

Regarding chains, it's working as it is supposed to.

Why are players allowed to remove coins from the trade window?]</i></font> <br><br>This is on the list. It amazes me the lengths that people will go through to scam each other.

Gordon made a few late night posts on the Gameplay Board recently.

I'll forward the bugs that were mentioned to the testing team, and the ideas over to the guy who's handling the revamping of all of the trade skills. <br><br>To be honest, since Alchemy was one of the most recent ones to get a revamp, first for items and availability, and later for cost of produciton, it's probably not going to be at the top of the list for enhancements going forward. However we can probably make some headway pretty soon here on the bugs. <br><br>I guess we should also pop up the price of fish gill extract as well :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006564.html"><b>Lack of CS</b></a><br>I'm not sure how to respond to this. You shouldn't give your account info to other people. Yes, what someone did to you is wrong, and if we find them we'll surely take action, but it was perpetuated by you giving out your account info, which is "expressly forbidden" by the EQ EULA. <br><br>If players reap consequences by engaging in activities that are forbidden by the EULA, they need to be held accountable for the consequences of those actions. Our GMs are too involved taking action in cases where issues are out of no fault of the player to compell them to "hand out items" for everyone who gives out their account info. Do not give out your account information to anyone, and you won't have these problems. <br><br>I do apologize to the original author for apparently getting the run-around over this issue, as he should have been told up front that the problem was out of our hands.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006849.html"><b>Low Delay Weapon Debate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Thousands of low delay weapons? Thats 100S3 >>>Twigs, 1 Whip on Luclin  Where the hell do you get 1000's?]</i></font> <br><br>From a database query. <br><br>Why am I seeing so many posts along these lines? We do have ways of determining what is in game and in what numbers. Truthfully, if it were only a matter of a couple on each server, we would have written them off as lucky and left them in game as is. But that isn't the case. There are quite a few of them on each server, though each poster here might only be aware of a few. There are roughly 8000 accounts playing on each server, half of which have characters capable of acquiring those items where they existed. No one person can say with certainty how many there are without direct access to our database.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006559.html"><b>Math and Logic</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: NO Abashi, its still only a 20% chance, since each spawn is independant of each other. ]</i></font><br><br>You are indeed correct that each roll has absolutely nothing to do with the other. However, the percentages are based upon individual term binomial distribution probability. If you have a 20% chance of success (loot) per trial (kill), the chances of at least 1 success in 6 trials is just under 74%. However six trials remains constant. If after the first trial you did not get a drop, your chances of getting one in the next 6 is still 74%. If after five more trials you still haven't gotten one, your chance of getting one in the next 6 drops is still 74%. <br><br>The probability is determined before the trails, and does not improve as the trials are completed (actually gets worse). For instance, lets say that we have the situation above. 20% of Frogs will drop the item. Lets say you decide that you are going to kill 6 frogs: <br><br>Before you kill the first frog, your chances of getting at least one item in the next 6 kills is: 73.79%<br>After you kill the first frog, your chances of getting at least one item in the next 5 kills is: 67.23%<br>After you kill the second frog, your chances of getting at least one item in the next 4 kills is: 59.04%<br>After you kill the third frog, your chances of getting at least one item in the next 3 kills is: 48.80%<br>After you kill the fourth frog, your chances of getting at least one item in the next 2 kills is: 36.00%<br>After you kill the fifth frog, your chances of getting at least one item in the next kill is: 20.00% <br><br>Previous rolls are never taken into account, since they do not impact future results. However future results are impacted by the probability success versus the number of trials. <br><br>You can set up a spreadsheet to calculate these probabilities using the BINOMDIST function in Excel. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Yes bad logic follows bad logic.

I bet you go broke pretty fast.<br><br>That is what your logic is saying. that the more a number is not rolled the better the chance it will turn up next roll. ]</i></font><br><br>That's not at all what my logic is saying. What my logic (and it's not even my logic, but simple statistics) is saying is that: "I bet that I can roll a 43 in 135 /random 1 100." If the bet was 100pp, and we wagered 10 times, who do you think would have more money when we were done? You might get some good rolls and come out on top, but I'm guessing that there is roughly a 91% chance (10 Trials, 74.25% chance of success per trial, 6 successes out of 10 needed to win)that I'd have more money than you at the end :)</UL>

Rowyl was on the boards today discussing several things relating to EQ, but mostly about the eqclient.ini file.  Here's the first post he made on the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006728.html">big thread</a> located at the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>I have already said this, and I believe Abashi has too, but since we are still getting a lot of requests for it, I will say it again.<br>I have fixed this. You will now have control over the spell failure color independantly of other spell text messages. This includes resists, can not see target, missing components, and so forth. <br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>On testing changes:<UL><i>This was not a matter of lack of testing. It was simply a matter of not realizing the impact of grouping ALL spell messages together in one color class. I realize the issue, and have already addressed it (should go in next patch). I honestly didn't think it was a problem since I focus more on what the message says then what color it is, but I can see where color can be used to help pick out what's important to you.<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>On comments in the ini file:<UL><i>Regaurding comments in the ini file... you can add them, but I just use one of the handy programs available on the net to edit my ini file. You should look into them!<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>On Rowl's character:<UL><i>I do play the game as a caster (lvl 56 druid), and I played all weekend without too much hassle at all. I must admit it was a little tougher to catch the resists on my snares, but I managed. It wasn't the end of the world. Our enchanter seemed to be able to deal as well. I just don't see this as warrenting an emergency patch. Besides, we had to test it and a few other things that had already been implemented between the time the patch exe was made and when it went live.<br><br>-Rowyl</i></UL>

Mysthawk Nightcaster sent me the following report for a GM event that took place recently on the Karana server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Forgive me in advance, I am not fluent in storytelling but I will tell ye <br>all the tale that has transpired before my very eyes.<br><br>Jaroth (Alas I do not know his last name) shouted in the East Commons that <br>he needed a Champion to fight his brothers.  Wyrren Soulstealer heard this <br>call and traveled to Jeroth to help in any way possible.  Alas I wasn&#8217;t <br>present to get the details of why we were to hunt Jeroths brothers, but <br>being a life long friend of Wyrrens I was at his side the entire time <br>thereafter.<br><br>Jaroth asked Wyrren to gather five more members as we would have a <br>difficult fight ahead of us.  This is when we found myself (Mysthawk), <br>Deano, Ravewolf, Lemac and Xistalben.  We had never before met, but the <br>challenge was before us, and we would not back down.<br><br>Jaroth gave us a clue of his first brothers whereabouts in the form of a <br>riddle &#8220;Northern lands void of water&#8221; which turned out to be North Ro.  We <br>found Drewyn Wyndsteed at a pillar near the ocean, upon arrival Drewyn <br>engaged us.  We beat Drewyn and acquired an amulet that we took back to Jaroth.<br><br>Jaroths second brother turned out to be in Kithicor forest.  This was a <br>mighty battle, Wyrren and Deano battled for what seemed to be an entire day <br>while myself, and Xistalben cast spell after spell trying to vanquish this <br>foe.  With a tremendous effort and no small part in the healings of <br>Ravewolf and Lemac, Zev Thuderfist fell to the combined strength of Wyrren <br>and his companions.  After receiving another amulet, we headed back to Jaroth.<br><br>Jaroth warned us that his next brother was extremely talented and was not <br>to be underestimated.  By this time, mana was low, nerves rattled and <br>tension high.  Despite all this we pushed on and headed to Lavastorm <br>mountains to confront Wyrrens final enemy.<br><br>Dalesk V&#8217;syrn was waiting for us when we arrived.  I let loose with several <br>ice comets to try and weaken this impressive foe while Wyrren and Deano <br>skillfully engaged him.  What seemed like an eternity of heals, ice comets <br>and devastating blows we emerged victorious.<br><br>Now battered and bleeding, and completely drained of all mana, we traveled <br>back to the East Commons to inform Jeroth that the deed had been <br>completed.  At this time Jeroth informed us that we must travel to the West <br>Freeport Arena to collect our reward.<br><br>What awaited us in the Arena was something in my 49 years of casting <br>thought I would never see&#8230; The Spirt of Honor awaited Wyrren.  The Spirit <br>of Honor challenged Wyrren to single combat where we were all honor bound <br>not to intervene.   Although Wyrren gave all that he could in the fight, by <br>the end the Spirit of  Honor stood over Wyrrens bleeding body.  Wyrren <br>refused to give up even with his dying stoke, but before the Spirit of <br>Honor landed the final blow he said &#8220;STOP!&#8221; and Wyrrens body was completely <br>healed.<br><br>After this tremendous battle Wyrren was blessed with two more miracles, <br>first being the presence of three more Spirits and a gift of the &#8220;Blade of <br>Champions&#8221;.  Upon receiving this blessed sword word spread fast of Wyrrens <br>victory, and I believe the exact words were &#8220;Let it be known that Wyrren <br>Soulstealer has earned the title of The Champion, after proving his <br>exceptional prowess in battle. The spirits salute you Wyrren&#8221;<br><br>I must now go to sleep as my efforts to aid Wyrren have cost me greatly.<br>Mysthawk Nightcaster<br><br><br>Out of Character:<br>This was a GM run event on the Karana server.  The GMs did an excellent job <br>with this event proving that you don&#8217;t have to be in a guild to partake in <br>the full aspect of the game.  Some of the rules we were bound by, no <br>rooting, snaring, mez'ing, charming, fearing or teleporting. Additionally <br>we could have no member above level 50.  This made for a very entertaining <br>evening.<br><br>We received 4 items total:<br>Fishbone earring<br>Combine 2 handed sword<br>Silvery 2 handed war axe<br>Blade of Champions<br><br>The Blade of Champions stats are:<br>Magic, Lore, No drop<br>23 damage, 48 delay<br>Effect: Force (88 damage, stun)<br><br>Wyrren Soulstealer would like to take a moment to thank Deano, Ravewolf, <br>Lemac, Xistalben, Mysthawk  and everyone else who helped us along the way, <br>your efforts will not be forgotten.<br><br>Party members:<br>Wyrren Soulstealer - 48 Warrior<br>Mysthawk Nightcaster - 49 Wizard<br>Deano (Valoran) - 50 Warrior<br>Xistalben Silvermoon (Knights of Kindred Faith) - Wizard<br>Lemac Justerian (Platinum Sphere) - 43 Cleric<br>Ravewolf Mystikfang (Pact of Aegis) - Druid<br><br><UL><li><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gmk1.jpg">Screenshot #1</a><li><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gmk2.jpg">Screenshot #2</a><li><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gmk3.jpg">Screenshot #3</a><li><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/gmk4.jpg">Screenshot #4</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon created a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006781.html">new thread on the Gameplay Board</a> centering on weaposn with low-delay's.  Here's what he reported:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>About a month ago I mentioned that we were still investigating the issue with some low delay weapons that entered the game recently, among these are the mosscovered twig and the barbed scale whip. <br><br>After analyzing combat data concerning use of these weapons, it is apparent that a change must be made to maintain (or restore in this case) balance. While we have no problem with weapons of this delay, they should not have been placed as loot on anything other than deity or dragon level encounters. As it is, these weapons were dropping off of low to mid level encounters, leading to thousands of them in game. <br><br>The next time we patch items, the extreme low-delay one-handed weapons (a list of specific items to follow in the near future) will be modified so that they can only be equipped in the off-hand. This will address the balance issue present with these items.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

It's the normal product life cycle. It is however still growing, adding more subscribers every month than it loses. <br><br>The lack of plans for newer servers for the foreseeable future has more to do with the fact that we've added so many, overcompensating for the crowding in January of this year, that we easily have 7 non-pvp servers that are underutilized at peak. It doesn't make sense to add new servers when the existing platform is underutilized.

You would still consume your share as normal, so you'd not be helping to powerleve groupmates, you just wouldn't advance while it's active.<br><br>Seriously, I'm having a hard time not advancing beyond my regular groupmates. I'm now a level and a half ahead of my wife, and several levels ahead of my brother. I'd like to continue grouping with them, but not advance until they catch up.]</i></font> <br><br>Interesting suggestion. I don't personally see a problem with it as long as the experience that you would have gotten isn't redistributed. Since that's in line with your suggestion, I'll talk to the guys about it. However this might be a situation where we'd have trouble justifying the time it would take to implement something of that nature. I wonder how many people out there would like to turn off experience gain to keep from out-leveling groupmates?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006741.html"><b>Hybrids & Items</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Until then, I will assume it's no harder than going through everyone's inventory and changing the stats on an item.]</i></font> <br><br>Modifying stats on an item does not require going through everyone's inventory.

I don't mean the standard "Not subject to post-production change".]</i></font> <br><br>Though the technical issues behind any modification of experience curves are not at all negligible and would require man-weeks, to say that we "cannot" is far less precise than to say that we "will not". We're developers, we can do anything given enough manpower. Whether "anything" is something that is needed for the continued prosperity of the game and in line with our designs for it is another matter. We will not change experience curves because frankly, it's been this way for nearly a year and a half, and people are advancing in spite of it. It *works* as it is. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006694.html"><b>"The End is Near Verant!"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Same thing is Happening to Eq now. It only takes a matter of time until someone makes a program that can dupe and copy images. It has been working for i would say atleast a month or 2. It has just now been confirmed due to the numbers of people who aquired this program hack. I dont know what verant is gonna do, or what they can for that matter.   There is a version of ShowEq on linux that Verant cant detect, and now this. ]</i></font><br><br>There isn't any third-party program that allows people to dupe. Character data is stored server-side, so only actions taken within game can affect it. ShowEQ is a packet-sniffer, and entirely passive program that just reads data. Sending modified data back to the server would be detected instantly. <br><br>That said there have been actions that one could take in game to cause a dupe, but all known instances of this problem have been repaired. Furthermore, with the level of logging that we have, and have had for several months now, we can detect both past and new dupes and take action swiftly. We've banned over 50 accounts since Thursday of last week and are still in the process of analyzing the data. For these reasons, these problems really do not represent a threat to the economic health of EverQuest. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006705.html"><b>Using ShowEQ to Target Players in PvP?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Its common knowledge that some of the pks on Gankos are using some sort of 3rd party program to find players. Its quite simple. They use a packet sniffer such as ShowEq to find someone around their level as soon as they zone in then proceed directly to that spot.]</i></font> <br><br>There's not really much that can be done that can't be undone by people who put their mind to it. Even if we further encrypt the data stream, the client still has to know how to decipher that information. Since we don't control the client machine, it's only a matter of time until that information can be deciphered by a third party program.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006659.html"><b>"Drop the experience penalty on Hybrid classes!"</b></a><br>As I've mentioned before, the experience system is not open to post-production modification.

Like any other class, I'm sure that things could be done to make them *more* fun, but the vast majority would probably consider something along the lines of what you propose to be "useless" in nature as it really doesn't affect their ability to fulfill their role. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006593.html"><b>Jaded Coffins</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Hi, I play on Vallon Zek. Due to obvious reasons, almost all humans and gnomes are our server are KOS in Neriak. Neriak being the only reasonable place you can purchase Jade coffins, this presents a problem. It isn't fair to force one team to use mules while another can easily acquire an item. There is no reason that Jade coffins can't be sold in another city as well as Neriak. Please add them elsewhere unless you intend for us to use mules for RP reasons.]</i></font> <br><br>Spell components are purposely not available everywhere. I realize that this presents some unique challenges on the PvP servers, however EverQuest is an will remain primarily PvE. The addition of PvP will in most cases not lead to changes that affect PvE if it can be avoided.

Warriors are balanced by their skills and equipment. Hybrids are balanced by their skills, equipment, and spells.

Brad took part in a forum discussion on the following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006359.html">thread located on the Gameplay Board</a>.  The topic centers on the upcoming second EQ expansion:<UL>Enough with expansions to this game. If it's not clear already that the limits of this game have already been pushed, then you must be blind. How often has a suggestion been met with "We can't do this because the engine won't allow it". Face it, there is enough "wrong" with EQ that fixing it may well warrant an entire redesign of the game itself. Instead of wasting development time and resources on an expansion that really won't fix much if anything, why not devote yourselves to a sequel that will address issues within the game that cannot be resolved due to limitations in the game engine, or changes to player data (which has been said won't happen since it would possibly cause problems you can't fix). Basiclly we don't need more of the same, we need something entirely new, but with a familiar background.<br><br>Yoshua Gilbert<br><br><b><i>Who said we can't do both?<br><br>-Brad</b></i></UL>Here's post #2 in this thread:<UL><i>Lana, the expansions aren't meant to be sequels. They aren't meant to radically change the game, or fix any fundamental problems.<br><br>They're supposed to EXPAND upon what EQ is. <br><br>Velious will give the players MORE EverQuest, and that's what a large percentage of them want. Kunark sold EXTREMELY well. And if we do another expansion after Velious, there will be even more EverQuest.<br><br>Sometimes changes, as you said, are just not possible given the engine we have, and sometimes they might be possible but either a. we don't think they should be changed or b. we think there might be better ways to approach it in the future but believe it would be foolish to make major changes with an extremely popular product that, overall, works fine.<br><br>I think future technologies and engines will be more flexible, but they'll still have limitations. And we'll still not want to fundamentally change a popular and successful game.<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>

Aegana sent the following tip:<BLOCKQUOTE>Just a quick note for all EQ'ers that have a problem with the <br>spell wear off color and the non-melee damage color.  You can <br>change your eqclient.ini and make line #28 for "Hit for <br>non-melee" and line 29 "Spell worn off" to R = 255, G = 255, <br>and B = 0 to make it bright yellow again.  Also, I am including <br>a copy of the new line assignments that came off of the <br>eqnews.txt when we downloaded the last patch.<br> <br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br> <br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with <br>default values.

Gordon stated he had too many espressos last night as he went on an early morning binge posting on the Gameplay Board.  As always, here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006187.html"><b>Gordon: What are you doing up this late?</b></a><br>I made the mistake of indulging in one-too-many espressos when I got home this evening. It has me up a little later than normal :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006191.html"><b>/Who Question</b></a><br>No /who listing will ever give level if a character is /anon or /roleplay. You'll have to rely either on what they say or the return from /con.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006186.html"><b>"Why can I not see my fire ball when I cast "Fire Bolt"?"</b></a><br>We moved missle creation server-side recently. That probably has something to do with the problem. I'll look into it Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006134.html"><b>Rogues Killing Greenies: Playing Nice?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Where do the rogues stand on the play nice issue of killing multiple green mobs to obtain poison components.<br><br>I'm asking because a player complained they were going to report me for killing greens that would have granted them EXP. I didn't kill steal any mobs they attacked but i didn't really leave much for em to kill.]</i></font> <br><br>Unless there's something more to this to which I am not privy, there's generally no problem with you killing whatever you wish providing that you aren't stealing the kills.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006166.html"><b>Corpse Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why in world is there a zone line that leads to instant death and an almost unrecoverable corpse?]</i></font> <br><br>The corpse is not unrecoverable. You can zone into the "preferred" entrance to the Hole and get a necro to summon your corpse. <br><br>As for why it's like this, that is just how the Hole is designed, and your death is the price of the knowledge that there might be a better way to go about what you are trying. Many things in EverQuest have to be learned, and are likely to cause death until they are. You should enter new areas cautiously until you learn how general rules and physics apply there. <br><br>Falling into an instant death situation is really no different than turning a corner and finding an NPC against which you have no chance given your current group makeup. Things of this nature need to be discovered and learned. <br><br>When the Hole first opened, we did put a short, somewhat vague, message in the patch message, since jumping in the Hole previously teleported people out to Toxxulia. The message was "GMs will not recover corpses for people who jump, fall, or levitate into the Hole". <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006179.html"><b>Bracer of Vajeen: Why can't Halflings wear it?</b></a><br>I'm not sure about this particular item, however if halflings were accidently excluded, we'll see about getting them put back on. I'll have to check into it on Monday. It's possible that they may have been purposely excluded.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006181.html"><b>"Why GM Events Don't Work"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: GM events have always involved killing something.]</i></font> <br><br>Not true. There have been many events that have taken place as stories to be witnessed and participated in. There have also been events where "killing something" has only been a very minor part of the event, rather than the central focus. Of course, we've always had the problem of getting people to refrain from killing the story-tellers, but we've taken steps to prevent that. Read below. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Who are the people in the game who can always kill something regardless of lvl? The lvl 50+s. So when you make a GM event and have most of the Mobs be around lvl 35, the people who are gonna kill them are 50+s.]</i></font> <br><br>The majority of events deal with actor npcs (npcs played by gms) rather than spawned NPCs (npcs that are still under the control of the servers). We've implemented the ability for the GMs to place a maximum level on who may attack them. That solves the majority of the problems that you cite. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As for risk vs. Reward, these lvl 55s have NO risk killing lvl 30 mobs, and are getting all this ph4+ l3w+.]</i></font> <br><br>Finally, I should mention that actor npcs hardly ever carry "phat lewt". We abolished that practice some months ago in order to avoid having the reward go whomever could kill the actor first.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006183.html"><b>"Ack! Too many spell book pages!"</b></a><br>Actually we're implementing a command that will let you flip to a specific page of your spell book.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/005599.html"><b>Howling Stones & Dungeons</b></a><br>When dungeons or new areas are designed, they have to be implemented as if they always existed. As such, it's possible that the quest would "require" some bottom feeding by people who have already out-classed the dungeon where the quest components are located. However, someone who is in the process of building their character could very well happen across the components during normal adventuring.</UL>
