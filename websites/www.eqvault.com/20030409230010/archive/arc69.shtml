This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and other updates.<br>- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument skills.<br>- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.<br><br>Thank you for your continued patience.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

The contents of the file are not important. This will turn off sound and should eliminate any sound related problems. <br><br>When troubleshooting to find out if your problems are sound or video related, it would be helpful if you would try this just to see prior to contacting technical support.

Here are a few more afternoon posts made by Verant's Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031648.html"><b>Unable to Cast Using CTRL-# </b></a><br>As Natalis mentioned, it's now ALT-# as default. CTRL was conflicting with some other things people were doing, such as strafing. You can change it back to CTRL if you like using the new keyboard customization abilities. See the patch message.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031641.html"><b>Screenshots of Graphic Bug</b></a><br>Definitely your video drivers. I've gotten a number of emails with this same problem and was able to work through them. Go out to the URL for your card listed in the "Driver Links" post I just made and get the most recent video drivers.<br>--<br>By the way, the URL to the "driver links" post is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031635.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031635.html</a><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031632.html"><b>EverQuest.com Redesigned</b></a><br><a href="http://www.everquest.com">http://www.everquest.com</a> redesigned. <br><br>Check it out!<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031263.html"><b>Listening to Classes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Abashi, why do you listen to some classes and not others?]</i></font> <br><br>That's what we do. <br><br>We evaluate the concerns that are presented and make determinations as to which concerns need to be addressed, and how addressing those concerns fits into the world of EverQuest. <br><br>Also, please don't mistake the decision to leave something as-is as "not listening". We listen, we just don't always make the decisions that some would like to have made.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031264.html"><b>On Response Time</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How about some minimal communications to your customers who pay the bills?]</i></font> <br><br>Stormrider, <br><br>Why are you suggesting that we aren't addressing people's issues with the patch? Alan and I have been over the boards for the better part of the day. We've also spent a good deal of time in the Chat Server helping people out there. <br><br>Finally, EQCSR-DAVID has responded to no less than 156 threads in the Customer Service/Technical Help forum in the past 24 hours. <br><br>If you have any specific issues that you'd like addressed, please post them, be courteous, and there's a comparitively good chance that it will be. Otherwise, please ask around a bit before saying that we're not addressing people's concerns. Not doing so is tantemount to a baseless flame.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031272.html"><b>More Direct X Info</b></a><br>Both versions are the same from EverQuest's standpoint. The only difference between the two are some calls that we don't use. There was no version 7.0a for Windows 2000, only for 95/98. In any case, 7.x is fine. <br><br>Sorry for the confusion.</UL>

Clarifying the Direct X issue, Alan wrote and posted a <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031197.html">new board post on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>It seems that there might have been some confusion about DirectX. Here's the story.<br><br>EverQuest is now set up to run with DirectX 7. However, Microsoft recently came up with DirectX 8. Versions of DirectX have been backwards compatible historically. But we have not had a chance to complete testing with DirectX 8. For this reason we highly recommend that you use DirectX 7 with EverQuest.<br><br>HOWEVER, because there are some changes between DirectX 7 and 8, some of your video or sound drivers may not run properly with DirectX 8 installed. These problems should be fixed when your sound or video card manufacturer updates their drivers for DirectX 8. <br><br>The same is true about earlier versions of DirectX. Because EverQuest is now utilizing the power of DirectX 7, you will most certainly need to install the newest drivers for your sound and video cards (and do so AFTER you install DirectX 7 or 7.0a &#8211; for EverQuest there is no different between 7 and 7.0a).<br><br>WE RECOMMEND DIRECTX 7 or 7.0a for use with EverQuest.<br><br>It seems that there is no easy way to uninstall DirectX 8. This is also beyond our control. But if we find something that will aid with this, we'll certainly let you know.<br><br>I'm sorry if there has been any confusion.<br><br>Alan</i></UL>

Alan was busy on the Gameplay Board tonight.  The following contain excerpts from his latest posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031180.html"><b>Sound Problems</b></a><br>You can adjust a lot of the sound volumes in game. Try that. If you're still getting odd sounds, make sure that you have the latest drivers for your cards (they should be installed AFTER you install DirectX).<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031175.html"><b>DirectX Issues</b></a><br>Loup_Garou wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Demano, [FLAME]. Direct X is suppose to be backward compatible with all programs. It IS Verant's fault."]</i></font> <br><br>Actually, it's not. <br><br>What happens is that when Microsoft updates DirectX, it often takes a while for video and sound drivers to be updated by the companies that make the cards. So, until they do that, there is a chance that some cards will not work with DirectX 8. This has nothing to do with EverQuest. This is also why we have been telling people to use DirectX 7 or 7.0a instead of 8. <br><br>On the positive side, it shouldn't take very long for most manufacturers to update to DirectX 8. When they do, you should be able to run EverQuest with those new drivers.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031174.html"><b>Video Display Size</b></a><br>Yes, you need to turn of the Screen Same Size option until the patch tomorrow, when it should (repeat - should) be fixed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031159.html"><b>Patch Problem</b></a><br>Correct. In most cases like this, re-installing the latest sound drivers (or video drivers) seems to fix the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031063.html"><b>Morale Boosters</b></a><br>Thanks for the morale boost. I expect to be busy for a few days. :)<br><br>I like your second idea. I know there are a few sites (or were) that do something like this. I've passed it on to the person that handles bright ideas for our web presence. Thanks. <br><br>It's pretty unlikely that we'll be changing the experience thing. I understand that there are greens that pose a real danger and still give no experience. But, honestly, we'd have to give so little experience for them that they would still be pretty worthless. <br><br>As for higher level charms&#8230; Higher level monsters do a LOT more damage in a shorter time. Adding to the duration of such spells could have a dramatic affect on the power of charming classes. <br><br>Though I have always liked the idea that druid pets would end the charm and not be angry at the druid. After all, they do it out of love, right? But there's an even bigger balance issue there&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031104.html"><b>Illusion Effects & Server Performance</b></a><br>At the time it wasn't possible to add spectres to the general list of models available to all zones. Recently, that fact changed due to some technology improvements and we managed to slip a few more models onto the list. It's not server performance that is the issue here, by the way, it's video card performance, but that's not the point. :)<br><br>But I don't see us giving undead illusions to Enchanters. Let's leave the undead stuff to the ShadowKnights and the Necromancers. <br><br>Butterfly pet? That's new to me. It sure would be pretty far out of line with the current line of pets for Enchanters.</UL>

Several more posts were made this evening by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board.  Here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031196.html"><b>Monk Epic Quest</b></a><br>Players voiced concerns and asked that the haste be made an activatable rather than a permanent. Remember that item haste will stack with spell haste, but similar hastes will not stack with each other. This gives the monk a chance to get a better haste buff from another class while wearing the item.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. I thought that 40str was gonna be changed to 40atk.]</i></font> <br><br>Two things. First, I don't believe that we ever said what specifically would be done with the item. Second, items do not directly modify ATK. They can modify STR which indirectly modifies ATK. <br><br>Spells however can modify ATK directly.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031204.html"><b>Druid Epic Quest</b></a><br>Well... We thought that we fixed it in the patch today, but there was apparently a problem. The NPC that accepted the final items was not handing out the reward. <br><br>As such, the Ops team is currently repatching the affected zones. It's really nice to be able to update things like this on the fly again. We apologize for the problems. <br><br>Those that handed in their items in the 3 hours or so that the bug was in and did not get their reward can petition. The GM will verify that you handed in the correct items and reimburse you pending the record in the log. <br><br>We apologize for the problem.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031184.html"><b>Responding to Accusations</b></a><br>I saw several posts from high level necros in that thread saying they like the effect, so it's not necromancers in their "entirety" saying another thing. <br><br>In any case, I'm the Associate Producer of EQLive and the Scars of Velious, not the customer service manager.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031134.html"><b>Customer Service</b></a><br>They didn't leave. A number went in game to help people there. There's still a substantial presense on the patch server. Please keep the flaming to a minimum, and check your email later today.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031106.html"><b>Lullaby Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lullaby is working as intended, the higher level songs will be re-examined at a lter date.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed. That was the determination we made after extensive discussions. We decided that the higher level targetable mez songs did indeed need to be adjusted, but that the AE version (lullaby) was appropriately powered given its intended scope.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/031101.html"><b>Background Programs Running</b></a><br>Let me clarify this a bit. <br><br>Play as usual, with all the normal stuff running. <br><br>IF you encounter a problem that might be related to a background program, then turn off that program before playing. If you encounter a problem with the game after the patch, try playing (at least for a few minutes) with nothing running in the background and see if that clears it up. If it does then try turning them back on one at a time (I'd start with your firewall then virus scanner...) until you figure out which one is causing your problem. <br><br>The idea of that message was, really, just to make you aware that some software running while you're playing might mess you up. Software that wants to take the attention of your PC from EverQuest, or something that is going to use up a lot of resources on your computer might cause trouble with EverQuest.</UL>

In fact, I've said specifically that it wasn't. I'm not sure why you are surprised that it didn't change. To be clear, no, the effect will not be changed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Alchemy is working"<br>-Gordan<br>I'd give em 6 months Zrazzt, maybe then they'll start listening.]</i></font> <br><br>Darack, at least do me the courteousy of not making things up.

Cross-teaming is merely fighting with members of an opposing team. It's of course assumed that if someone attacked a group member, that you'd try to help them out. That doesn't necessarily mean that you are on the *same* team as the attacking person, but its certainly possible. <br>--<br>I should say, both are permissable.<br><br>Your example is often referred to as using "invulnarable healers", and yes, that is permissable.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030757.html"><b>On Customer Service and Running a Business</b></a><br>Thanks a lot for your comments Dakon. I wish I could relay how nice it is to see people taking time out of their day to write up something positive. It is human nature for people to speak up when upset, but far more in line with human nature to be silent when pleased. It's nice to see someone go against the grain.</UL>

The big message for today's patch is up and is now being dislayed on the Patch Server:<UL>November 15th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology included with DirectX 7.  You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in order to play EverQuest.  Please refer to <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml">http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml</a> prior to contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting technical support.<br><br>Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been speaking about for some time.  The new sound engine supports additional EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have been posted in the past.<br><br>*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*<br><br>The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight.  All players wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog yes" during the windows.<br><br>The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Please check the scheduled downtime page of www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided.  Remember that corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time of the actual move.  <br><br>As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the command during the window.  You will need to be present and execute the command in order to move.<br><br>*Spell Changes*<br><br>-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary resist.<br>-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of day.<br>-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item.  The effect was checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.<br>-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest Item.<br>-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate races.<br>-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned<br>-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength spell.<br>-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.<br><br>-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat.  In addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.<br><br>*General Fixes/Changes*<br><br>-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people who were fighting pirates.<br>-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game since they do not have the piercing skill.<br>-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.<br>-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.<br>-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.<br>-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items.  Please check your items to see your changes.  Note:  Not all changes will be evident by looking at the item.<br>-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the correct loot.<br>-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.<br>-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.<br>-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.<br><br>-- Repaired the Forager Bag.  It was causing people to lose weight when placing items in the bag.  It is supposed to have a weight reduction component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.<br><br>-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50.  Previously, creatures above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill.  Now, most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully taunted.  As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is smaller than that of a creature below 50th.<br><br><br>*Client Enhancements*<br><br>-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.<br>-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the total number of available socials by 108.<br>-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to translate incorrectly.<br>-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at higher resolutions.<br>-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider.  Users should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones that support an adjustable clipping plane.<br><br>-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads when linkdead.  In addition, these same players will no longer show as "LinkDead" in the /who list.<br><br>-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game.  /usercolor:  Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, and B are red, green and blue respectively.  All changes will be automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.<br><br>-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the character name indicating the server number.  As such, you will now be able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with different custom options.<br><br>-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number and character name.  For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.<br><br>-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI file:  AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack turns on automatically when assisting.  Defaults to "TRUE".  ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the "Soandso is inspecting you" message.  Defaults to "TRUE".<br><br>-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced.  You can now set two keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game.  In addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set to a key of your preference.  Left-click on the key identifier to set the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.<br><br>-- Added the /note command.  /note will append the following text to a file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory.  For instance, typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next line in the notes.txt file.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Runelaron!

That looks to be a *long* time from now. After nearly 20 months of operation, the subscriber base is still growing showing that EQ will be around for a while. <br><br>It's hard to say just how long the life of a premium MMORPG is, but I imagine we'll find out one day.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030677.html"><b>Abashi's Birthday?</b></a><br>Er, I know not where this came from, but someone's data is mistaken.

I spotted <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/030461.html">the following thread on the Gameplay Board</a> that Alan stopped by and responded to this morning:<UL>Before you go off and do something irrational, please make sure you read the quoted paragraph carefully.<br><br>From what I see<br>- Quests required DS updates, both server and client side. Hence, patching JUST the servers would not work. The client must be patched.<br><br>- The live team has been altering the client to use DX7.0a. Now they also have to patch it for quest related changes. They can't just "yank out" the DX7.0a client changes for quests, and then put it back in. They had to add the quest changes in along with all of the DX modifications<br><br>"The nature of the data structure precluded partial updates" - This means that they have to do a full patch (this next upcoming patch) to implement the changes.<br><br>Therefore the quest changes you seek should be in this patch. I think those quests are working on Test.<br><br><b><I>Ankhorahil: exactly.<br><br>We may not have fixed all the quests in question. But any fixes will be going up with the patch tomorrow. And anything that we're going to fix will be working on Test, if you want to check it out.<br><br>Alan</b></i></UL>
