Here's a few late evening posts from Gordon from off of the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020699.html"><b>Display Bug</b></a><br>I've heard about the bug before and we're aware of it, but it's not the type of thing that gets really high priority in the grand scheme of things. Here we have a situation where everything is working, but something just doesn't look quite right. Issues where things aren't working quite right have to take precedence. <br><br>It's roughly equivalent to the hole in a gnomes head when wearing a chainmail coif. We hope to fix it at some point but there are many factors that keep it from being something that we can rush in and do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020698.html"><b>Surnames</b></a><br>It sounds as if you may have gotten a newer GM. I'd ask if he'd be willing to escalate the issue. The name mentioned doesn't violate the naming policy in my opinion. <br><br>Here's the portion of the naming policy that applies: <br><br>"Note: Non-words like--D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases (e.g. D`Kval is acceptable where D`Basher is not)." <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/018762.html"><b>Sash of the Dragonborn</b></a><br>Horrible haste item? I don't think that it's horrible by any means. It's better than the FBSS. <br><br>In all fairness though, we ninja-enhanced it in the patch last week :)</UL>

The following are Gordon Wrinn's words as posted by him to the EQ Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020578.html"><b>GMs Taking Quest Items</b></a><br>There's always more than one side to stories like this. I would imagine that the people on the other side would have an equally compelling story to tell. <br><br>The issue at hand is the actions that the GMs took. About nine months ago the main complaint we were seeing is that the GMs were telling people "We can't help you" when issues like KSing would come up. People didn't like hearing that they had to be at the mercy of unsavory individuals with a lot of friends in game, so we decided that the GM staff would start getting involved. <br><br>Now, when someone petitions a GM for a player-interaction issue, the GM *will* make a decision based upon the information at hand. Sometimes people will agree with that decision, sometimes they won't, but it will be a judgement call in the hands of the person making it. <br><br>GMs are called in when people can't reach an agreement on their own. It is not at all unusual for a GM to come in and mandate a course-of-action that is pleasing to neither party, so I *highly* recommend that everyone make a good effort to work these things out on their own.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020617.html"><b>Monks and Casters Nerfed?</b></a><br>I don't think that the fact that tailoring isn't included qualifies as a nerf according to the generally accepted definition. <br><br>That said, similar things may be included in tailoring at a future date.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020621.html"><b>Commands Unusable</b></a><br>We already have the changes for the "cant use while casting" messages in relation to songs. It should go live the next time we patch the client.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020535.html"><b>Archery Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If I cast a spell, I can immediately hit autoattack and there is no delay in my first swing going off. Subsequent swings use the delay, but never the first swing.]</i></font> <br><br>What if you already have autoattack engaged? If by hitting autoattack anew it fires right away, we'll probably have to look at that since it is likely a bug as well. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: However, with a patch about a month ago, you BORKED archery delays after using a spell. You had to wait until the spell gem activated again before you could successfully shoot an arrow. One of the problems is you were still allowed to shoot, but it went to a void.]</i></font> <br><br>It didn't really shoot. The server just said that it was too soon for you to be using archery, while the client grayed out the spell for the duration. A little bit counter-intuitive to say the least, which is why we're going to have the ranged button gray out in the future. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If there is the slightest bit of elevation, either downslope, or upslope, the arrow will rarely, if ever, give you a message. Does it stick in the ground.. miss, hit? We don't know because you broke something.]</i></font> <br><br>As I said in my last message, this is something that we are still looking in to. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But making up excuses to why you can't fix a problem is a poor stance on your part and it further alienates you from your subscriber base. It's no wonder we all cringe when there is a patch. ]</i></font><br><br>That's how it was explained to me by the programmer and the designers, so it's not likely to change. That said, we alientate ourselves from our customer base every time we tell them something that they don't want to hear. It's plain by looking at your posts. Two months ago we were the bane of existnace in your eyes. One month ago we were the best thing around. Now we're swinging back the other way. <br><br>As much as I'd like to only have to tell people the things they want to hear, I don't get to do that, and I think that you'd all tire of it if I did.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020444.html"><b>Suspended</b></a><br>I assume your suspension just happened today since you are able to post in this forum. You probably won't be able to post here after the data is propagated tomorrow morning. <br><br>To answer your question, when you are able to log into the game, your suspension is over. Suspensions usually last 7 to 10 days based upon severity. If you were not told by a GM in game that you were being suspended, you should receive an email in the next day or two giving you specific information.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020452.html"><b>GMs and No Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what's the deal? Am I just not in the grove with gm's is that why I never get any service. At level 12 I had a midnight mallet or something like that hehe I laugh at it now but I was trading it one day showing someone it and it vanished a GM verified it and said we'll get back to you and get you your item, never heard from him again. ]</i></font><br><br>Though you may have gotten help transferring a nodrop item at level 12, we put a stop to this a few months ago. NODROP items are NODROP because we do not want them changing hands. The GMs will not assist in the transfer of some items. I'm sorry that you disagree, but this is the policy that we follow. <br><br>That said, we are considering putting in a confirmation box when someone tries to loot something that they cannot use in order to cut down the number of accidental loots.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020443.html"><b>Rogue Tourney Loot</b></a><br>There was no loot given to the winner of the rogue tourney.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020433.html"><b>God Upgrades</b></a><br>It's still on the plate, but we're busy with some other content additions at the moment. For example, we felt the epic quests were a bit more important than going back and buffing up the Gods. There's some other things out there that we've got people working on first before we'll revisit the deities. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020438.html"><b>What's your favorite city in Norrath?</b></a><br>Rivervale or Qeynos. They both feel very "alive" due to the NPCs walking around and talking with each other. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019903.html"><b>Policy</b></a><br>I'm not sure why a GM would have gotten involved in this situation as it's a clear-cut case of someone dropping something. When we put in the item-drop confirmation box we made a policy determination that GMs would no longer get involved when people drop items, that anyone who is concerned that they might drop an item should leave the feature on. <br><br>In this case, based upon what you say the original owner of the dropped items shouted, they evidented dropped it so that they could log out and log on another character to get the items. As far as I'm concerned it was indeed fair game. <br><br>If you'd be so kind as to kick me the name of the GM in an email at gwrinn@verant.com, I'll be happy to look into the situation. <br><br>Regarding the "under 13" thing, that has to do with a law that prevents us from storing information about people under the age of 13. There is no restriction however on who may play EverQuest given parental permission, just who we may have listed as the owner of the account. The EULA grants you, and one minor child living with you, a license to play on the same account. The age of your child and whether or not EQ represents appropriate content for that child is up to you. <br><br>Please accept my apologies for this situation. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020436.html"><b>Dazed and Confused on Mithanial Marr</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Was it expected? Nope, Should it have been expected? No way. But the fact is, it happened. And to top it off, I get added to a "LIST" of stranded Norrathians wishing to test the waters and make new friends from a different server. A "LIST? Pardon my explecitive, but WTF is that all about?]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, a list. We can take care of these issues one by one and have it take a month to do, or we can take care of them all at once and get 99% of it done in a few days. <br><br>The GMs on MithMarr and Tunare are making lists of people who requested a move but didn't get one. We hope to run the modified list through the process on Friday.</UL>

The dev team is working on the issue and it should be fixed soon. </i><br><br>...which I've just found out is incorrect. The fact that players were allowed to use their bow directly after casting a spell was a bug that was fixed in that patch. The programmers tell me that it was intended for bows to become unusable for their full delay following the casting of a spell. In case anyone is wondering, the post-casting delay has always applied to the primary and secondary melee weapons. In other words, if someone using a 50-delay weapon casted, they wouldn't again try to hit with their melee weapon until 5 seconds after the casting of the spell. It turned out that this delay wasn't being correctly applied to the ranged slot as well. <br><br>Now there is a problem regarding the way that the delay is handled. For instance, if you are wielding a 40-delay bow, and you were to try to use it 3 seconds after casting a spell, you'd have to wait an additional 4 seconds before you could use it again. This we will correct in a future patch by making the ranged button gray out during the initial delay. <br><br>There is an additional problem regarding excessive misses in archery that went hand in hand with the skill being moved to the server side back when the change above went in. This is on the list to be fixed as well. <br><br>I apologize for my incorrect statement earlier.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020429.html"><b>Playing EQ in a Cyber Cafe</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If so, would the license terms of EQ allow such establishments to legally let people play?]</i></font> <br><br>Our license agreement doesn't allow this, so I doubt that you'll be able to find a cafe that has this as an option.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020421.html"><b>Banning Stations Name Thread Closed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: find that somehow the thread got closed. I'm sure that this was accidental.]</i></font> <br><br>It was probably closed due to size. I really don't think that there's a problem with continuing to discuss this. <br><br>The issue at hand is that though many EQers feel that their station name is just like their password: something that noone should ever see, it is used as login for other station games. For instance, EQ players could login with their game account and password and go play JEOPARDY! Online. That offensive station name would then be revealed to other players of the game, which is why the policy exists.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019659.html"><b>Premium Server Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: At first I answered no to the poll... as 50 bucks seems a bit steep... still does a little.]</i></font> <br><br>The price-point mentioned in the poll had to be one that would ensure a minority of posters in order for service to be considered "premium". For instance, were the projected price point $12.95 per month, I imagine that an overwelming majority would have said yes, at which time the service being provided would be "average" for the scope of the game, regardless what that service entailed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: With the amount of CS reps you would be able to afford would this possibly allow GM's or CS reps to have characters of multiple levels that may be able to help in filling or starting groups for people that may be having a hard time getting into a group? ]</i></font><br><br>Though we still haven't fleshed out exactly what "premium" would mean, I think that its fairly safe to say that we wouldn't be providing CS members as group-mates. About the only way we'd be able to do something like that is if we went to an hourly rate.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020309.html"><b>Ignore</b></a><br><LI><a href=""><b></b></a>Sounds like you don't like being ignored. If I put someone on /ignore I can tell them they are on /ignore with a simple tell if I am that concerned with them knowing they are being ignored. However, I might just want to put them on /ignore and not let them know. The last thing I want is some idiot jumping up and down /rude'ing me to get my attention because I /ignored him and every time he sends me a tell he gets a message reminding him that I have him on /ignore. Think.]</i></font> <br><br>There's also the point that ignores are done on the client. Your client already has to process the incoming messages and determine that they are from someone you are ignoring. To then having it formulate responses to those who are sending you messages would be an added load. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020346.html"><b>Queue...Please Wait</b></a><br>The most I've ever seen that portion of the login pause is around 30 seconds.

The following is all the latest quotes and excerpts from the posts Gordon Wrinn posted to the Gameplay Board this evening:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020390.html"><b>Splurt and Asytole</b></a><br>Splurt is not an upgrade to Asystole.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020394.html"><b>Demographics of the Split</b></a><br>Around 1750 from MithMarr and 750 from Tunare. That's of confirmed unique registrations. It's apparent that the /movelog command dropped a few people, something that we plan to take care of over the next couple of days.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020384.html"><b>GM Favoritism</b></a><br>Favoritism? No. A GM being in the middle of a situation where he is going to have an unhappy customer regardless? Yes. <br><br>I don't see any problem with what happened here, though I personally would have chosen to upset the first person rather than you in this case. With the drop confirmation being in game now, people are fully responsible for what the drop, and if someone else picks it up that is how it goes. <br><br>Perhaps what happened here was that the person petitioned that the item "disappeared" (which is how they usually show up) and the GM said no, you dropped it and so-and-so picked it up. There's no policy preventing them from giving out that information, and if the GM chooses to, that is up to them. <br><br>Just because you ended up on the receiving end of a bad call doesn't mean that there was favoritism. GMs have the unenviable job of coming into he-said/she-said situations and trying to figure out how to best apply their policies. Someone will always feel that they somehow got a raw deal.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020008-6.html"><b>Banned Because of Offensive Name</b></a><br>I'm surprised that this discussion has gone on for so long, because the is pretty simple: <br><br>Playing EverQuest requires that you have a station account. Station accounts are closed if the name they are created with breaks the Station Terms of Service. <br><br>So yes, open an EverQuest account with a vulgar station name and it will be closed if you draw attention to yourself. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020370.html"><b>Splitting From a Server</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) You tell people that they can move only 1 week before the server move. Well, people past level 30 are some what conscientious of who they group with. Abashi has stated in the past that Verant is "pro grouping". With this in mind you should know that it greatly affects my move decision if my friends are going or staying. 1 week is not enough time for me to contact ALL of my group buddies and see if they are going or not.]</i></font> <br><br>No matter how much time we've given there are always some people who feel that it wasn't enough. I'm sorry, but we're not going to be able to please everyone. I think a week is a good round figure, and is enough for 90% of the people to get together and make the decision. For the 10% that can't, they should stay on the source server. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) Why must a movelog be done on a single day? Why can it not be spread out over a few days so that 1 billion people will not try and perform it the first second it becomes available and perhaps avoid what happened on Friday with Mith Marr (kept going down, 2.8k+ on the server). Also doing a ninja move like the one on Mith Marr sets people up for the mindset of "I must log in right at 8pm and perform the server log before everyone else does". Spreading the move over a weeks time may help minimize the mindset. ]</i></font><br><br>I warned people not to execute it at the exact second, and not to mention left the logs open for 6 hours on TWO nights due to the problems on the first night. The issue is that we want to move peak users, hence, we only take registrations during peak hours. Sure some off-peak people log on to request a move, and that can't be stopped, but overall it's pretty successful. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) Guilds. Why can you not move an entire guild? ]</i></font><br><br>Because we can't. I understand that people don't like this but it's not likely to change. I've explained several times that these things are too resource (human) intensive to perform on a person-by-person basis. Nearly 9000 accounts play on every server, and the only way we could service all of those people individually would be to put every single one of our customer service poeple on it for a few weeks. Even if we did that, we'd still have people who are upset because they didn't get moved as they wanted to. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4) Some people own multiple accounts. One of the GMs of Mith Marr told me that he could not assure me my 2 accounts would be xfered, one could stay and one may go. Are you really this inflexible to your patrons? This is unacceptable. ]</i></font><br><br>Multiple accounts is the EXACT same thing as the guild issue mentioned above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5.) And on a larger scale even if you put in the movelog command you are not even sure if you will go to new server. WTF? ]</i></font><br><br>Obviously if *everyone* on the server were to execute the command, we couldn't move everyone, right? Well if 90% execute the command, it stil lwouldn't make sense to move all of them. Somewhere in the middle is a range that is acceptable for a move. *THAT* is why we cannot guarantee moves for everyone who asks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6.) You have made no effort to keep friends and guilds together. ]</i></font><br><br>You mentioned this above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7.) I can see no reason why you cannot release the numbers involved with the movelog. We should be able to find out the maximum number of people who will be moved, the number of people on each server who have already put in a movelog command ]</i></font><br><br>In advance? No, we can't announce it. Because if I were to say that we would move 1500, and 1501 ask to be moved, it wouldn't be very reasonable for us to refuse to move that last person. Not to mention, we frequently adjust the numbers based upon the projected peak-time users. <br><br>Anway, in this case we moved everyone who we had record of executing the command. If we didn't get you, please kick an email to Chris and we'll see about getting you moved. Please put some faith into the idea that we'll try to do what's best, ok?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020382.html"><b>Ogre Immunity to Stun</b></a><br>The immunity to stun is based on those caused directly by melee blows. Stun spells or special abilities that stun do not apply. The immunity works in every case that it should.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/020383.html"><b>More UI Changes Coming</b></a><br> Yes, we have a number of additional changes planned for the UI. Stay tuned and we'll elaborate as we can.</UL>

On the Arena Board, Lady Dae made <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/harpys-head/Forum9/HTML/000040.html">the following announcement</a>:<UL><i>Verant Interactive Presents<br>The Test of Tactics &#8211; Best of the Best Event<br><br>The Test of Tactics was the first official event held by Verant Interactive, being held over a year ago on Xegony. The event is designed as a 6 vs 6 event, with minimal amounts of rules involved. Due to the massive time cost on the event, it was decided upon to move to smaller events that would take less time to run and place a smaller burden on the server staff.<br><br>With the incredible demand that the players have shown for the events, we are going to bring back the Test of Tactics, and do a Best of the Best for all servers to find the greatest 6-man team. We have modified the rules slightly so that we don&#8217;t have 200 teams per server enter, and it will be able to be run quickly and efficiently, while still trying to keep the original spirit of the event alive.<br><br>The 6-man team has now become a 7-man team. The &#8220;Captain&#8221; of the team must be a level 58 or higher. Two &#8220;Elite&#8221; team members need to be 55 or higher. The final 4 of the team make up 3 &#8220;Support&#8221; team members of 49th level plus, and a &#8220;Substitute/Coach&#8221; position that can be of any level. This does allow for a 7-man team of all 60th level players.<br><br>Only 6 will fight at one time, and the 7th can be substituted before the match. Once the team has been chosen, those 6 must fight. The 7th during the match is restricted to observation or coaching.<br><br>Rules are fairly simple. No starting buffs, no starting pets, no use of fear, no use of charm, and no use of knock back spells. Once the match starts, you may buff, summon pets, use activatable items, cast spells, engage with melee, hide and sneak, disarm opponents, use uber-quest weapons, do whatever is needed to assure the victory of your team.<br><br>The &#8220;Ring&#8221; for this match is the raised platform of the arena. The only characters allowed in the center arena is the 12 players involved, and the Lead Judge of the event. All players involved must remain in the tiles at all times. Leaving the tiles for any reason will result in a warning, then disqualification of the player involved.<br><br>Security for this event will be extreme. Any non-combatant who even stands up on the raised platform will be removed from the arena and banished from the event. No spell casting, no bard song, no use of shout will be tolerated at anytime for those watching the event. Event Staff can and will remove any player that causes even the slightest disruption of this massive event. <br><br>Before the claims of uber-guild, uber-item, uber-whatever start, be advised that of the 3 Test of Tactics that have been held, the team that has practiced the most have won these events, even over higher levels, better equipped, and longer playing characters. How well you understand the basics of 6 vs 6 player vs player combat, and getting a well balanced team will determine how well your group does in the event.<br><br>The ToT-BotB will start October 16th and run through October 28th on Live Servers. The final event will be a 2-day event on Test Server, October 28th and 29th.<br><br>Prizes for this incredible event are still undecided, as well as the question of an entry fee. This will be discussed and made final in the next week.<br><br>Good luck to everyone participating, I shall see you on the battlefields!<br><br>Lady Daegarmo<br>Online Events Coordinator<br>Verant Interactive</i></UL>

Here is this evening's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019913.html"><b>Roleplaying in EQ</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What are your thoughts Abashi?]</i></font> <br><br>There are certainly people who feel the same as you do in regards to roleplay. My best suggestion would be to seek them out and group with them. You're not the only one :)<br><br>You could also consider starting over on one of the Team servers, where people tend to follow your ideals. I've always found the team servers very conducive to roleplay, even when grouping with people who haven't done it before.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019989.html"><b>/Loc Code Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: They won't do it. They don't like /loc in the game as it is, so they won't do anything else that would justify its use.]</i></font> <br><br>That's pretty accurate. We certainly don't want to broaden it's usefulness.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019896.html"><b>Client Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I just found out from a reliable source that EQ checks the CHAT/LOGIN server every time you zone? Could this be why I always get dropped when I zone?]</i></font> <br><br>The client doesn't check back with the login server when zoning. As many are aware, we've taken the login server down several times while leaving all of the game servers up. If this was the case, people would get kicked out in masses any time we did this. <br><br>I'm not sure why you get dropped when you zone. You might consider deleting all of your OPT files in your EverQuest directory (you'll have to reset customizations). You should also run a "Thorough File Check" from the patch program. <br><br>What speed is your connection?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019686.html"><b>Ragebringers Too Easy</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are Ragebringers so "Easy"?]</i></font> <br><br>Essentially, the designer was a little optimistic. It became a little more difficult in the last patch and will probably undergo several more adjustments in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019789.html"><b>Trade Robbing</b></a><br>My best advice is to be careful. Be sure that the person you are trading with is the one who is actually intended to receive the items. Sure, we don't want to see the activity mentioned in the beginning occuring, at the same time we don't want to see equally despicable players setting unsuspecting people up and using the GMs as an offensive tool. <br><br>The best offense is a strong defense. You are ultimately responsible for who you hand your items to.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019815.html"><b>Item Duping</b></a><br>I sincerely doubt that there are any game-damaging dupes out there. We've had the reward offer out there for some time, and only received one that was verifiable, and that was a dupe of soulbound items which are all nodrop anyway. <br><br>Here's a copy of the reward offer: <br><br>Hello all, <br><br>For those who are new to online games, a &#8220;dupe&#8221; is a bug that allows<br>a player to &#8220;duplicate&#8221; or &#8220;copy&#8221; items, creating two items where once<br>there was one. We've heard some reports that there may be a dupe bug<br>somewhere in game. While we're confident that we do not have any current<br>issues of this type, we'd like to provide an incentive to everyone to<br>report such things should they become aware of them. <br><br>The FIRST person to submit reproduction steps for any dupe bug will<br>receive the following: a) A free EverQuest account. We'll mark your<br>current account as free, or provide you with a new, free account,<br>and b) Subject to approval by us, the title of your choice will be<br>applied to one of the characters on your account. <br><br>To qualify, you must include all of the information below. Furthermore,<br>THE REPRODUCTION INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE CLEAR, CONCISE, AND PRESENT<br>LOGICAL STEPS ALLOWING OUR TEST DEPARTMENT TO REPRODUCE THE BUG.<br>Send an email with a subject line of "Dupe Bug Report" to<br><a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> containing the following: <br><br>1. Station Name<br>2. Real Name<br>3. Phone Number (Day and Evening)<br>4. Primary Play Server<br>5. Primary Character Name<br>6. Complete reproduction instructions. <br><br>&#8220;Dupe Bug Reports&#8221; will only be considered if they contain all necessary<br>elements of information including complete instructions for reproducing<br>the bug. While we appreciate notification of all potential problems,<br>only concrete first-hand experiences will be considered for the award.</UL>

The following contains Gordon's latest post to the official Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/010981-4.html"><b>PvP</b></a><br>There are a lot of spells out there that are nearly unresistable. I really don't have first-hand experience with these spells, but if that's the case, I'll take your word for it. <br><br>I noticed that the thread is mostly bumps wanting some sort of comment about it, but I really don't have any.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019818.html"><b>GM Corruption</b></a><br>Why is it that you assume that there is some favoritism going on every time someone gets something over on a GM? It happens sometime. I wish that it didn't, because if it did we'd be able to take players word for things on a broader basis, but unfortunately it does happen. <br><br>It doesn't sound like from what you've said here that the person should have gotten a res. That said, it is only a third of the story. I'm sure that there is something here which we here on the boards are not privy to.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019832.html"><b>Pet Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Long ago, when Mage pets were *not* dual-wielding, and the Focus items were introduced; Mages received a number of mid-level and high-level items.<br><br>Necromancers received only 1 high-level item, off of a God [Innoruuk] no less. Reason? Necromancers are strong enough as it is--by GZ.]</i></font> <br><br>Well, the same answer still applies. Regardless of what has happened with mages and focus items, necros are still strong enough. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019798.html"><b>Gone for a Day Over the Weekend</b></a><br>What's sad is that if I go away for the weekend, and have access to a computer while I'm there, I still come here and post. Just can't drag myself away :)  Maybe people will understand why I take the "you don't care" posts too well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019712-2.html"><b>Wizard's Epic Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Thanks to the efforts of hackers, everyone who has bothered to look the info up knows what their FA weapon will do as its "special property".]</i></font> <br><br>And thanks to the effort of Javier, the game designer looking after the spell database these days, the hackers didn't get very far. Javier put a ton of red herrings in the spell database to keep them busy. <br><br>As to the person who broke the display of the the thread with your "hahaha" and subsequent flaming, you should check your email tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019757.html"><b>Blighted Drops</b></a><br>Each type of NPC that can drop a particular kind of armor has a percentage chance to spawn. Once spawned, each has a percentage change of dropping a particular item. <br><br>These percentages cannot be considered average over a single plane clearing. It really can't be considered an average over 10. Perhaps 100 is more likely to give a meaningful average. <br><br>If you look at the posts here on the board, you'll see that different servers complain about different drops in the planes. This suggests pretty well that drops are working appropriately. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019733.html"><b>Gargantuan Spider Leg Quest</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Come on fix the Gargantuan spider leg quest]</i></font> <br><br>It was fixed over a month ago.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019584.html"><b>Server Split Moves Guaranteed?</b></a><br>I wouldn't say anything along these lines is "guaranteed". I would say that if we guaranteed the moves that there would be a very good possibility we'd end up crowding the other server. The possibility of being split up from friends is about the only thing that keeps the numbers manageable. <br><br>Anyway, I've asked Ops for counts from both MithMarr and Tunare, and should know if we'll be able to move everyone soon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019710.html"><b>Large Races Being Punished?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why are large races being punished?]</i></font> <br><br>Because they have so many other advantages. Great stats, slam, regen (if troll), immunity to stun (from front, if ogre), are all among those advantages.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/019711.html"><b>Bards Nerfed Again?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Selo's Accelerando, thats right, our level 5 bard speed song, has been cut by about 25% speed.]</i></font> <br><br>We haven't changed it.</UL>

Illanae Willowsbane passed the following message that was posted to our Povar board along:<BLOCKQUOTE>So many of you responded when you heard of Dawn.... the child of two of my <br>EverQuest guildmates. The few minutes you took from your day to visit her <br>website at <a href="http://www.dawnspage.com/">http://www.dawnspage.com/</a> and leave a message for her on the <br>message board there have meant more to the little girl than any of you could <br>possibly imagine! <br><br>Here is what her father had to say about it..... <br><br>"The response we have gotten is wonderful. The many posts have helped lift <br>Dawn to a new high. She is ready to face this thing head on and beat it. I <br>honestly have not seen her this ready to face this disease since she was <br>first diagnosed with it over five years ago. There are not enough words, and <br>I am not sure there are the right words to express what an impact this has <br>made on me and the rest of the family. <br><br>I do have to ask that if you have stopped by and left her a message to please <br>keep doing so. Starting Oct 12 she starts a minimum of four months in the <br>hospital and I know that any words of encouragement during this phase are <br>going to help." <br><br>And here is a message from her mother ........ <br><br>"We have learned that we are going to Denver on the 9th of October to get <br>ready for the transplant. I am so glad of all the support I have seen and I <br>Thank-you ALL very much! Please keep the messages coming in. Dawn really <br>likes it and some of them make us work even harder to do our best at eating <br>and keeping in good health. I am touched at how many people could care about <br>a little girl that they don't know except what they have seen on her webpage. <br>And wish to encourage you to keep writing and hope with all the messages she <br>will pull through a little harder. As of right now she is doing her best to <br>please not just herself and family but everyone that has writen her and <br>wished her good luck and keep her spirits high. I can't Thank-you enough and <br>will Thank-you for as long as I can." <br><br>========================================================= <br><br>Dawn has suffered from Acute Lymphoblastlic Leukemia for five years now and <br>she was diagnosed with her second relapse in April of this year after only <br>having gone into remission about a year ago. The doctors have said that it is <br>likely she will only survive this round of the fight if the upcoming bone <br>marrow transplant is successful. The pain and suffering this young child has <br>endured is incomprehensible to most of us.... she can pronounce the correct <br>names of prescription drugs and understands more medical procedures than most <br>adults <br><br>Dawn goes to Denver on Tuesday the 3rd of October to get a check-up and tests <br>done. Then she goes to Denver again on the 9th of October to get ready to <br>start the process for her transplant. That starts on Oct. 10th with <br>outpatient radiation and then she will be admitted on the 12th to start her <br>chemo and everything else to clear her body of lekumia cells so that the bone <br>marrow transplant will take. <br><br>Please take a moment to leave her a message.... little things can mean so <br>much! </BLOCKQUOTE>Awesome, I hope everyone can help out! :)

I'll let him know you want the pink back :)<br>--<br>Oh, and there will have to be a ways to make red or pink if I can convince him to put pink back in.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001154.html"><b>Arrowheads</b></a><br>I agree the crafted arrowheads should be cheaper to make than the vendor cost of the purchased ones. I've been meaning to address their values.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001174.html"><b>Missing an Iksar Herb Vendor?</b></a><br>I was under the impression that the Iksars already had both herb vendors. I'll get the missing one in for the next patch. Sorry about that.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum8/HTML/001186.html"><b>Wish: Tinkered Armor</b></a><br>The idea was brought up her in the office as well, but there's no telling if the artists will be available to make it a possible. I wouldn't want it to look exactly like the clockworks either, it should be less run down looking.</UL>
