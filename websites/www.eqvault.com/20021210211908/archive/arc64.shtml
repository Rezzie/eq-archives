The following updates were added to the manual supplement in a recent update via the Patch Server:<UL>Sense and Disarm Traps<br><br>In addition to rogues, bards, who always had the ability to disarm traps,<br>have gained the ability to sense them as well.  Since we are aware that some<br>may have not bothered training sense or disarm traps due to them formerly<br>being unimplemented, bards and rogues will have the ability to gain skill<br>without training once they have reached the appropriate level and have<br>crossed a zone boundary.<br><br>These skills now have use within Velious.  There are traps, and they range<br>from annoying to deadly throughout Velious.  They are invisible and can only<br>be detected and disarmed by rogues and bard.<br><br>Use &#8220;Sense Traps&#8221; to see if there are any traps in the vicinity.  If so, you<br>can then use &#8220;Disarm traps&#8221; to try and disarm the trap.  Once disarmed, the<br>trap will remain inactive for a short period of time (about a minute) while<br>your group passes through the area.<br><br>If there are multiple traps within range, your attempt to disarm will be<br>directed towards the closest one.<br><br><br>Corpse Dragging in Velious<br><br>Due to the importance of faction within Velious, we wanted to avoid a<br>situation where a group could die in an area, and then easily bring in<br>someone with good faction to drag all of the corpses out without consequence<br>or risk.  As such, there are some zones in Velious where dragging a corpse<br>is considered &#8220;assisting the enemy&#8221; by the inhabitants of the area.  They<br>will react accordingly.<br><br>Same Resolution Looting, Trading, Inspection, and Inventory (Velious Only)<br><br>Previously, when looting, trading, or viewing inventory, the screen would<br>switch to a lower resolution mode (that small UI in the center if you are at<br>resolutions above 640x480).  Now, if you are in resolutions above 640x480,<br>nearly all functions take place in the higher resolution mode.  Functions<br>that currently do not take place in the higher resolution mode will do so in<br>the near future.<br><br>Experience Bar Enhancement<br><br>Players will notice a blue line in their experience bar in addition to the<br>bars.  The blue line is a &#8220;macroview&#8221; of each bubble of experience.  The<br>blue line will fill the entire experience bar for each for each bubble of<br>experience earned.<br><br>The User Interface features new options and screens that allow players to<br>remain in the &#8220;Full Screen&#8221; video mode when playing the game, rather than<br>switching to the lower resolution &#8220;Overlay&#8221; mode.  As a result, the<br>additional windows superimposed on the full screen UI are greater in number<br>and support additional options:<br><br>Positioning<br><br>Windows can now be moved to a location of your preference by clicking on the<br>upper left-hand corner of each window, moving it to a location of your<br>preference, and clicking again to set it into  place.  This option is set on<br>a &#8220;per-resolution&#8221; basis, so you can have different window positions for<br>each resolution.<br><br>Scaling<br><br>The Chat and Spell-effect windows can be scaled in size by clicking on the<br>lower right-hand corner, dragging to the desired size, then clicking again<br>to set the option. This option is set on a &#8220;per-resolution&#8221; basis, so you<br>can have different window scaling for each resolution.<br><br>Enabling / Disabling Windows<br><br>Each window in full screen mode can be enabled or disabled for viewing by<br>engaging the customizable hot-key combination for that feature and window.<br>The defaults are:<br><br>ALT &#8211; B: Buff/Spell Effects Window<br>ALT &#8211; P: Party (Group) Window<br>ALT &#8211; C: Chat Window<br>ALT &#8211; S: Spell Gem Window<br>ALT &#8211; H: Hotbox Window<br>ALT &#8211; T: Target Window<br>ALT &#8211; Y: Self-Status Window<br>ALT &#8211; M: Menu Window<br><br>LoadArmor17 through LoadArmor22 = TRUE or FALSE	(Velious Only)<br><br>Defines whether or not you want to load the new armor implemented with<br>Velious into your video card&#8217;s texture memory.  Players with older video<br>cards may choose to set one or more of these options to FALSE if you<br>experiencing slow framerate or excess swapping when viewing these armors in<br>areas with many textures.<br><br>By default, these are all set to &#8220;FALSE&#8221;, as it is possible that those with<br>lower end systems will have problems when attempting to load all of the new<br>armor files.  At your option, you can switch all or part of them to &#8220;TRUE&#8221;<br>to see the new armor.  If you have problems with framerate or disk swapping,<br>turn all or part of them back to &#8220;FALSE&#8221;.<br><br>As a note, though you may be able to obtain the files and make these entries<br>if you are not Velious-enabled, the new armor will not be displayed unless<br>you are.<br><br>[WindowColors]  (Velious Only)<br><br>This section contains custom color settings for the transparent polygons<br>behind chat and other windows in full-screen mode.  It can be set using the<br>/wincolor command in game.<br><br>Pauses in Social Batches<br><br>You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command.  /pause<br>takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to the number of<br>tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second pause).<br><br>For example, a social consisting of:<br><br>/sit off<br>/cast 1<br>/pause 100<br>/sit on<br><br>...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 seconds<br>after you&#8217;ve STARTED casting the spell, and sit down.<br><br>Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as another<br>social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the pause<br>command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on the same<br>line.<br><br>For example:<br><br>/sit off<br>/pause 100,/cast 1<br>/sit on<br><br>...would have the same effect as the example above.  It is important to note<br>that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from another,<br>and MUST be specified first on the line.<br><br>General Hybrid Disciplines (All Hybrid Classes)<br><br>RESISTANT (Level 51 &#8211; Velious Only): +3 to all resistances.  This discipline<br>lasts for 1 minute, and has a base reuse time of 1 hour.  The reuse time for<br>this discipline will decrease as you level.<br><br>FEARLESS (Level 54 &#8211; Velious Only): Immunity to &#8220;Fear&#8221; and all spells that<br>cause &#8220;fear&#8221;.  This discipline lasts for 11 seconds, and has a base reuse<br>time of 1 hour.  The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as you<br>level.<br><br><br>Paladin Disciplines<br><br>HOLYFORGE (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): Critical Hits and Crippling Blows<br>versus undead.  This discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse<br>time of 72 minutes.<br><br>SANCTIFICATION (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Immunity to most types of harmful<br>spells.  This discipline lasts for 10 seconds, and has a base reuse time of<br>72 minutes.<br><br>Shadowknight Disciplines<br><br>UNHOLYAURA (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): 25% increase to damage done by<br>Harmtouch.  This discipline has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br>LEECHCURSE (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Heal self for every point of melee<br>damage dealt while discipline is active.  This discipline lasts for 15<br>seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br><br>Ranger Disciplines<br><br>TRUESHOT (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): Max to two times max bow damage.  This<br>discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br>WEAPONSHIELD (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Parry all melee attacks.  This<br>discipline lasts for 15 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br><br>Bard Disciplines<br><br>DEFTDANCE (Level 55 &#8211; Velious Only): Auto dodge and auto dual-wield.  This<br>discipline lasts for 10 seconds, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br><br>PURETONE (Level 60 &#8211; Velious Only): Makes it as if you are wielding the best<br>instrument of every type, whether or not you are actually wielding an<br>instrument.  This discipline lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse time<br>of 72 minutes.</UL>Thanks Will and Arcke!

But it's not as though we've hidden the rules about naming characters. It is unfortunate that names breaking the rules remain in the game so long, and therefore the players get attached to them. But the rules are pretty clear, and we do our best to stick by our rules as tightly as we can. And those rules have existed since the game was opened, not thirty days into it. <br><br>Again, I'm sorry if the name changes upset anyone, but we're pretty firm about it and we think that it adds a lot to the game to have charactes with names that fit the setting.</UL>

This is the Saturday Edition of the Absor Infobits:<uL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036149.html"><b>More Pet Clarification</b></a><br>Hi. <br><br>We looked over all the details about pets (again). <br><br>For example, in order to make a sweeping change to pet stats someone would have to change the data for every individual pet (and there are dozens of them). If something like that were done on purpose it would take a lot of time, it would never be an accident. If it happened accidentally, it would probably have had to happen by some sort of software glitch, and would have probably happened to every NPC. Regardless, we looked at the stats, they are all the same as they were pre-patch. <br><br>We looked over the code that determines how the pet acts, its attacks and all of that. It's all just as it was pre-patch. We checked it over, summoned pets and looked at their stats, how they fought&#8230; Nothing has changed. <br><br>But, as of Monday we will be making one small change to something that has always happened. Some spells could summon pets both under and over 35th level. Pets 36th level and over are more powerful than those of 35th and under. We didn't like the idea that pets summoned with one spell would range so greatly in their power. So we've set it up so that such spells will only summon pets over 35th level. This is, obviously, a small increase in the power of those particular spells. But I want to stress that this will be completely new as of Monday. Pets have always had that level range problem. This is one of those fixes that comes of careful scrutiny of a situation like this. So some good has come of all this. <br><br>I don't know that there is much more I can say. <br><br>I ask you all to keep in mind that your pets were procing more than they were before, and that they could proc even on a miss. Keep in mind that your pet levels can vary greatly with each summon. Pets will have to fight longer without procing weapons, so they may seem to be more vulnerable&#8230; <br><br>We've looked over everything, and we found nothing wrong in the programming. <br><br>I have a few e-mails from mages telling me that they've seen no change with the exception of the procing (and see the improvement from the auto-dual wield ability). Please, take a step back and look at your pet again.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036222.html"><b>Pets and Procs</b></a><br>No non-weapon procs were changed at all on any pets.<br>--<br>I meant to be firm. No intended, no maybes.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036246.html"><b>Tab Button Trouble</b></a><br>Tab should only target you when you do not have the chat window open. With the chat window active it should cycle between the people that last sent you tells. <br><br>You shouldn't have too much trouble using that in combat.</UL>

Last night a new message went up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>December 1st, 7:00pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>*SBLive Soundcards and Hardware Acceleration*<br><br>Due to some past problems with SBLive cards, users of those cards who called into tech support were asked to turn "Hardware Acceleration" down one notch in DXDIAG.  The last patch corrected those problems and most users should again increase hardware acceleration to maximum.  <br><br>To do this:<br><br>1. Click "Start"<br>2. Click "Run"<br>3. Type "DXDIAG.EXE" and press enter.<br>4. Click on the "Sound" tab.<br>5. Increase the "Hardware Acceleration" slider to maximum.<br><br>Doing this should correct issues such as not hearing certain sounds or sound volume disparities.  <br><br>The only users who may not want to do this are Windows 2000 users.  Creative Labs is currently working on new drivers for Win2K, so you may wish to wait until these drivers are completed prior to increasing hardware acceleration.<br><br>Finally, all SBLive users should get LiveWare 3.0 from <a href="http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/.">http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/.</a>  After installing LiveWare, you will then want to REINSTALL the latest drivers for your sound card.  The order of installation is important.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Brad McQuaid added his comments to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877.html">yesterday's thread</a> focusing on a variety of EQ issues including nerfs: <UL><i>I do recall replying to AuntieShaynta publicly quite some time ago, stating that it was still our intent to implement Enchanters enchanting items, but that such plans were still very much in the planning stages and considered long term. <br><br>And I stand by it -- I still think we'll see that one day (and given our desire to pretty much freeze class balancing, it will probably be one of the last significant class enchancements). But hey, never say never :)  Consider traps :)<br><br>Also, if I recall correctly, item enchantment was also talked about in earlier pre-release (probably pre-beta, but I'm not certain) FAQs, but I later had it removed (along with guildhouses, lycanthropy, vampirism, etc.) It simply was one of the few features we'd planned on but didn't have time to deliver on. <br><br>It does trouble me a little that even though I try to be clear about whether something is short term, or long, or something we're only thinking about, etc. that it often turns into a 'promise' over time... but I guess that's unavoidable. It's a form of the 'telephone game' quite often, where one person hears that we said one thing, and then they tell somebody else, and the message sort of evolves from there :)<br><br>Just to let you all know, there are still a TON of things we want to add to EQ, and we feel EQ has a very long life ahead of it. For example, although it's too early to say much, I will say that we've got some VERY big plans post-Velious. <br><br>And Tera, wow... not sure what to say :(  I certainly do my best to live up to my word. Again, though, some times things I talk about as something planned evolve somehow into 'promises'... And then some things I hopefully characterized as 'long term' are still just that: long term plans that haven't happened yet. <br><br>All things considered I'm very proud of our track record and just how much of the game we talked about pre-release game into fruition. And I'm also very proud of where the live and expansion teams have taken the game post-release. IMHO, EQ is almost everything we'd planned it to be and a whole lot more. <br><br>-Brad</i></UL>

This is today's edition of the Gordon Infobits:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036041.html"><b>"We're locking threads..."</b></a><br>Posts that are monopolizing the front page with a particular issue are being locked. That's clearly defined as against the rules in the board FAQ. Chances are that if an issue is that important it's already been addressed a number of times. The mage pets issue that's currently hot falls under this definition. We've announced exactly what changes were made, and no changes other than what we've told you have been made. We've continued "looking into" the issue over the past several days and can find absolutly nothing to suggest that any other changes have occurred. If something changes we'll let you know, but until then the issue is closed. <br><br>Posts that are rude or antagonistic are being locked. See the FAQ. <br><br>Posts asking why threads are being locked are being locked. Posting threads of this nature is essentially spamming the boards, so please don't do it. <br><br>Thank you for your cooperation, <br><br>-Gordon<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036095.html"><b>Pets</b></a><br>I did some testing, specifically with 49th level necro and mage pets, and compared them to my results from early this year. Both pets were naked, no buffs, and both had similar results to what occurred earlier this year with the same tests. <br><br>I'm not sure what I can say to put everyone's concerns to rest. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036036.html"><b>Verant Ignoring Reasonable Requests?</b></a><br>This issue has come up a number of times and I've explained our position. We do not do ad hoc moves between servers. <br><br>The sheer number of requests along this line that would come in would keep a staff three times our size busy 24 hours per day. Remember that there are over 300K people playing EverQuest, and number of characters are well into the millions. <br><br>Now it has been suggested that we should charge for the service, but we feel that server communities are important, and that characters should have to live with their reputations. <br><br>The short of it is that it is not economically feasible to do ad hoc moves, and even if we were to set it up so that it was, we'd still be dealing with the issue of the importance of server communities.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036147.html"><b>Endless Threads on Same Subject</b></a><br>Endless new threads on the same topic: Why they hurt everyone... <br><br>It's simple. People go looking for "official" posts on an issue, and instead of having to look at two or three, they have to filter through dozens. The ones with the official replies are missed and end up down on page 10, while post after post gets bumped to the front page asking "Why are you ignoring this". Please, do everyone a favor and use the search tool to look and see if there's a post on your issue that may have been answered already. I've personally answered 3 of these pet posts today, and read at least half a dozen threads asking why we haven't responded to the issue since then. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036106.html"><b>More Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Did you say that DEX was much lower for pets now ? ]</i></font><br><br>No. The Dex of pets is not lower than it ever was. What is lower is their proc percentage chance based off of that dex. It used to roll of the NPC table and now rolls of a PC table. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does DEX affect the fact that an Attack lands, and also affects damage ? ]</i></font><br><br>No. It does not. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Did you also lower AGI on pets now ? ]</i></font><br><br>We have not lowered any pet stats. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Now... I have the same example in about 4 or 5 threads of a battle with a blue croc in other posts. My pet was getting hit for more damage, and was hitting less often for less damage. Coincidence ? How can 2 hours of trying the same thing be coinsidence ? I played in Oasis for a few hours prior patch and it wasn't that way. ]</i></font><br><br>You aren't dealing with constants when fighting things in Oasis. NPCs have level ranges. Pets have level ranges. Hit and miss percentages have ranges. Damage dealt and damage taken have ranges. A combination of good or bad rolls on one side or another can make it appear that things have changed in one way or another, but they haven't. <br><br>I've been back and forth with several programmers over the past two weeks about this, in addition to running my own tests and having them run theirs. The only determination that we've made is that aside from the procing weapon issue, which I think people understand as a bug fix at this point, is that they have not changed. <br><br>Perhaps the best way I can "prove" to everyone that they haven't changed is by pointing to the lack of people with concrete figures here. When we *really* change something, the board is flooded with a certain type of player making complaints. These are the people who log and parse everything, and can find changes with the combat engine down to single percentage points. Those people are not here. What we have are people who "get the feeling that" something is different. <br><br>Trust me, if there was something different with the basic way pets were in combat, there would be players here with exact figures explaning exactly what changed.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036148.html"><b>When will SoV go live?</b></a><br>Providing that retailers don't sell it too soon, it will be live on the servers by the time you get home from the store with your box.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035759.html"><b>Patches and Bugs</b></a><br>We correct outstanding issues with nearly every patch. As much as I'm sure everyone would like to see every outstanding issue addressed in one patch, it's not realistic for us to do that. Just because we don't fix all of them in every patch, or don't reply every time they are reposted on the bug board, doesn't mean that we aren't listening. <br><br>By the way, could you explain #2 a little better? I can't make sense of it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036023.html"><b>Polls and Statistics</b></a><br>My first instinct was to pass this post up because it uses the "pull numbers of out thin air and call them facts" method of debate. The only way to "address" a post of this nature is to spend a day researching all of the correct numbers for the purpose of showing what really is fact. That would take too much time and only validate this method as a way to get a response, which is why we pass these posts up. <br><br>That said, there is one claim I would like more information on: <br><br>What server is this that you play on that you've noticed a 200-300 player drop at peak over the past year? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035997.html"><b>Female Rest Animation</b></a><br>We don't like the way that the stance looks. Perhaps we'll go through and revisit it in the future, but no promises at present.</UL>

Alan kept busy on the Gameplay Board today.  The following contains the latest messages posted by him, along with one post from Gordon as well:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036114.html"><b>Spam: First Post from Gordon & Followed Up by Alan</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It's worth the headache for them. Even the most belly-aching posters sometimes post good ideas. Verant then comes though and cherry picks the good ideas and implements them. Many good improvements came from suggestions on this board. I am sure that Absor and Abashi may hate their jobs some times, but were else can they get this many people that have ideas to improve their product. ]</i></font><br><br>Very well said Orm. <br><br>Good ideas do come from these boards, and they are often the first place that we get some real-time feedback on problems that pop up from time to time. <br>--<br>We don't hate our jobs! <br><br>And I do my best to revisit posts and see what responses my comments earn. That's the essence of communicating. Spamming is like yelling at someone repeatedly to get attention. It doesn't mean that the person yelling isn't in need of help, but it sure doesn't make for effective communication.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036115.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br>Belgariad wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Mage Epic. There was some talk from alan that you might change the cloak from quillmane. If that is planned than i would like you to hear this suggestion in how it would drop. Have a new NPC in a mid level zone (that doesn't have a lot of newbies that would try and ninja the items). Have that NPC ask for the two quest focus items that wasn't requested in the epic (the torch and the stien). When you turn these 2 items in it would spawn a high level elemental (like the one in Burning woods for cleric epic quest) that a 4 to 5 groups could kill with some trouble. The elemental would drop the cloak used in the Air portin of this quest."]</i></font> <br><br>If there is a change to the cloak drops, it will probably not be anything nearly that dramatic. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Next concern in the mage epic is that so far nobody on any server has gotten burning ember and can prove that they got it. People has been killing every wurm countless times that are a short jounery from skyfire. Is there any way for you to get EsterTheTester to go to a live server and let her try and get it. "the burning embers from a notable member of wurm-kind who can be found a short journey from here " this is the only clue to burning ember and there are a lot of notable members of wurm-kind near skyfire. <br><br>Dirt of underfoot a stealf enhacement and than a stealf nerf. It was put into the game on the patch before thanksgiving and it dropped every time when you killed silxen the mighty in BW. About 5 days later BW was patched by itself and mages thought that it was to fix the noexesting burning embers but what happened was that the dirt of underfoot now is a very rare drop." ]</i></font><br><br>Burning Embers were, in fact, goofed up severely. They are in game now, I've seen them myself. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Any idea when the staff from Inny will be moved to his mionions like the quest giver tells us?" ]</i></font><br><br>When/if that happens, keep in mind that it will be moved to an equally difficult opponent. Such a move will probably not make the item easier to obtain. I've got no estimate for the timing of such a move, I can't even promise you that it will happen for sure.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036172.html"><b>Sympathy</b></a><br>Thanks. <br><br>It's not as bad as you make it seem, really. I'm having a ton of fun.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036031.html"><b>More on Thread Locking</b></a><br>Yup. I am only locking pet threads to keep the board open for you to talk about other things, like the Test Server, if you want. And mages would be better served posting in one thread, it makes it much easier for me to read and respond.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036034.html"><b>More Pet Threads</b></a><br>Secias, <br><br>I'm locking the extraneous threads about pets. I'm doing it because some of you are forcing me to do it, and because I want to converse with people about it, not hunt down individual posts. <br><br>And now, because I'm wasting my time locking threads, I'm going to ask you to stop posting more threads like this one. Please. I'm not inclined toward sending warnings&#8230;<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/036021.html"><b>Locked Pet Threads</b></a><br>Unfortunately, I am locking threads again. It's not very useful to any of us that are actually trying to discuss this issue to have to hunt for information. If we stick to one location we'll be able to talk about it much more easily. And this board isn't as useful if the front page is full of post on one topic.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035605.html"><b>New Link Death Issue</b></a><br>I don't know what to say... <br><br>Ok, maybe I do. <br><br>I'll send this link to some of the guys here. But you're much better off posting this on the tech board. I'm not a tech...<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035877-2.html"><b>Negative Respect</b></a><br>I'm going to respond only to the original post. It would take me hours to respond to the whole thing in any detail at all&#8230; :)<br><br>AuntieShaynta: <br><br>Well, I stand by my 'victims' statement. I'm not going to argue it with you, except to suggest that perhaps you didn't read it as I intended to write it. The fault there would lie with me, I understand. I could spend another ten posts discussing it, but that would be redundant. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me. But I see no reason for that to make you respect me less. That's something I'll have to think about. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "Instead, what you (Verant) did was to purposefully and knowingly give an ability to other classes and purposefully and knowingly did not give enchanters this ability -- nor any form of compensation."]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, we did. And we didn't give it to the other&#8230; minor pet classes either. We gave it to the classes that we consider primary pet classes. I honestly see nothing wrong with this. And I see no logic behind the idea that one class should be 'compensated' for things done to other classes. Should we, then, reduce the power of your class any time we reduce the power of another? I think you're failing to see the larger picture. We didn't make that choice to spite anyone, be they enchanter or shaman or any other class (in a way, rogues could use your argument and want to know why they were not also compensated for something that the these other classes were given). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "1) I was told by Verant that I would be able to enchant weapons, including the ability to enchant weapons to cast spells. I have seen this degraded several times despite a direct promise from Brad that enchanters enchanting weapons WOULD be implemented "in the long run". Now I see several spells that appear to be the "enchant weapon" spells -- being given to other classes. I'm reserving judgement, frankly against my better judgement." ]</i></font><br><br>I've been following this game as long as anyone, longer than most. I've seen what you saw too, though not in exactly the same way. <br><br>At first the idea of enchanting weapons was just that, an idea. It became a 'something we'd really like to do' thing before beta. During beta it became a 'we really want to do it, but it doesn't look like we can' thing. At release it was the same way, something that they wanted to do. I don't remember any promises, from Brad or anyone else. But I might have missed that. <br><br>I can't say I disagree with you about the apparent ability that another class might or might not be getting to do something that seems very similar to enchanting an item. Personally, I plan to push for that ability, if it exists, to be given to enchanters in some way. But there may be technical issues that neither you nor I are aware of. So let's both wait and see. Though I kinda fail to see how any of this make me less respectable&#8230; Remember, you were talking about Absor, not Verant&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "2) I saw the by-any-definition poorly-handled "mage pets aren't dual wielding" fiasco solved in what had to be the second poorest way possible -- requiring giving pets weapons but removing the delay-reducing benefit of doing so. A blatant nerf to the two classes that could already have a dual wielding pet by giving them weapons. One of those classes got an admittedly small compensations. The other was told "You're not a pet class" -- despite the fact we get pets at every spell level pre-50. I took this in stride, but it was noted." <br><br>3) Now I see what should have been the solution to the mage-pet-dual-wielding fiasco being put in much later -- and once again enchanter pets are purposefully left out. Without compensation. In fact, with a mild attendent nerf (I can't attest to this myself, as I haven't even seen a SoR yet ingame) of our pets not proc'ing as much as they used to." ]</i></font><br><br>And I guess your disagreement is with the idea that enchanters are not a pet class. They are a secondary pet class. There are two primary pet classes, magicians and necromancers. All others are secondary pet classes. *shrug* I can see how you might not like that definition, but that is the definition (we not only 'get' to set those definitions, we 'must' set those definitions or the classes wouldn't be balanced at all). Enchanters are unique in their way, as you say. They get pets at all levels. But you'll note that they also have very weak pets, in comparison. That is by design. <br><br>I think the problem here is perspective. Mine is that enchanters are secondary pet classes, and therefore they shouldn't have pets that get to dual wield without a weapon. Yours is that you are a pet class and therefore your pets deserve that ability. I don't know what I can say to change your perspective. And I don't know what you can do to change mine. I only wish you could understand why we made that choice. It's really not a matter of 'compensation' for anything done in the past. It's a matter of how it should be. We can't sacrifice the balance of the game just to compensate for things we might have done in the past. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: " What's more, I know you (Verant) aren't going to correct any of the "core" problems with EQ. Everything is subject to change, it seems, except the things that most need changing." ]</i></font><br><br>What are the core problems? I'm curious about your take on that. Certainly the fact that enchanters don't make magic items isn't a core problem. It might be the core of your personal dissatisfaction with your favorite class, one that I can't deny. I wish it was in there too. But enchanters work, they work well. They are unique, they fit into the game, they&#8230; they work. Do they work as they were initially intended? Maybe, but not entirely. Do they work the way you want them to? It seems not. That's unfortunate. But enchanters are still a rockin' class, and they have some of the coolest abilities of any class in game (and I'm not talking about Clarity, I'm talking about illusions). <br><br>But, at the end of all of this, I have to ask the personal question, since this is clearly a personal issue between you and me. How have _I_ earned your disrespect?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035984.html"><b>Entering World Bug?</b></a><br>A thorough file check is the first step in fixing something like this, especially since it's pretty easy to do. :)<br><br>But in general you're better off posting your technical problems on our tech support board. David does a great job helping people with their technical problems.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/035959.html"><b>Board Problems</b></a><br>Alright... <br><br>So now I have to go from locking post about pets, to locking posts about the posts about pets... <br><br>*sigh*</UL>

The message is new, as is the level restriction.<br>--<br>Oi! <br><br>Yer right. <br><br>I'll look into it further...<br>--<br>Yup, that seems to be the case.

This will happen with some regularity with pets cast from 39th level (52nd for shadowknights) spells and above.<br><br>No other changes to the duel wielding ability of any other pets was changed.

I received the following from Fitten:<BLOCKQUOTE>Outdoor Dragon Hat Trick and Two (Three) Rathe Server Firsts!<br> <br>Last night Blades of Destiny on The Rathe were looking for something to do and ended up pulling a hat trick involving the three outdoor dragons in Kunark.  First stop was Severilous, who fell as usual.  Next, everyone flitted off to Skyfire to attempt Talendor.  Having been unsuccessful against Talendor a couple times in the past, we were going to give new tactics a try.  We met Talendor and laid him low for the first time on the server!  Buoyed by these two successes, everyone decided to run give Gorenaire a try -- surely our stars were aligned properly as evidenced by the success of this server first!  We regrouped quickly and met Gorenaire in Dreadlands for the first time since the day these three dragons were introduced into the game.  The first clash sent us packing but was a close fight.  We decided to quickly regroup and give it another go.  This second attempt was met with success!  Congrats to Blades of Destiny for pulling off all three outdoor dragons in one night, two of which were Rathe server firsts!!  These server firsts followed on the heals of the first killing of Silverwing in Veeshan's Peak on the Rathe by Blades of Destiny this past weekend!  It has been a fun week =)<br> <br>Fitten TallWalker, Heirophant<br>Blades of Destiny</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
