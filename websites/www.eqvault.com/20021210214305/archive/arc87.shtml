Gordon kept busy this afternoon with several new posts to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008933.html"><b>FD & /Quiting Out?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "FD will work 25% of the time on wanderers, 90% of the time when the creatures return to their post."]</i></font> <br><br>All creatures forget about a successfully feigned character once the creature returns to it's spawn point. That of course doesn't apply to creatures that don't have a static spawn. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Monks hate having to do it, and would prefer that FD worked the old way so that we could use our skill without endangering other adventurers in dungeons. This "cheat", as you call it, is your friendly neighborhood monk's attempt at being as little an inconvenience to you as possible. Don't give them a bad time about it.]</i></font> <br><br>It has been suggested that make anyone feigned automatically "stand up" upon a /q, however we don't have any plans to implement that in the foreseeable future.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008967.html"><b>EverQuest Isn't for Everyone</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post:  As a casual gamer I don't have hours and hours to sit and play. Unfortunately to get anywhere in this game that's what is REQUIRED.]</i></font> <br><br>It's only "required" because you perceive the need to attain the same levels and equipment as the guy who plays 12 hours per day, even though you only have that many hours per week to play yourself. There are many players of this same type, one which I refer to as the "time-starved powergamer", rather than the "casual gamer". <br><br>The time-starved powergamer holds the same desires and drives as the powergamer, but only has limited time to play due to real-life concerns. The player is driven by advancement and acquisition, whereas the casual gamer is more interested in the gaming experience. <br><br>Would it make sense for us to create a game based around the 10 hours per week figure when the average player plays around 23? The game is set up around that average figure, and someone playing that average amount of time can expect to progress at an average rate. The consequence of this is that people who play double or triple that progress much faster, and people who play half that often want to progress as fast, on a calander basis, as those who play double or triple the average. <br><br>Regardless the advancement or acquisition rate in game, there will always be people who play less than the average. It wouldn't make sense for us to gear the game so that people who play less than average progress at fastest rate. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: As for racing to 60, well you assigned us levels and when you set a cap you set a goal. Everyone wants to achieve that goal although the vast majority never will. 50 was attainable but 60? It's a pipe dream for most and probably the number one reason people will quit EQ because they simply accept the fact it is beyond reach.]</i></font> <br><br>We never expected every play to reach level 50, and certainly never expect everyone to reach level 60 either. The "average" player will reach "average" levels and will never "max out". The important thing is that those levels are there for the people who decide to advance to that point and have the time to do so. I see from your post that your character is level 39 now. That's a very respectable level for someone who can only play a few hours per week. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Make it so we each have an equal chance to achieve all that is achievable in the game with the exclusion of Veeshan's Peak. Make that dungeon so tough that 200 of your best powergamers can never make it 100 yards into it. That should keep them occupied for a while.]</i></font> <br><br>Games of this nature have to service a broad range of different player types. Sometimes servicing one type of player molds the game in a direction that isn't liked by another type. This will always be the case. Your post seems to suggest that you think that every gamer, regardless of how much time they put in, should be able to go everywhere and do everything. Would it make sense for us to make a game geared with 10 hours per week as an average? Or what of a game geared to 5 hours per week on average? To do what you suggest, that being allowing the 10 hours per week player to advance and acquire at the same rate as is enjoyed by the current 40 hour per week player, we'd have to set the average to about 2 hours per week. What fun would the game be for the average player then? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: EQ should allow everyone the same opportunity to achieve the same items and experience ]</i></font><br><br>Opportunity is a constant. Everyone in game has the same opportunity. They then decide how much of that opportunity they wish to pursue, guided by personal desires and real-life factors. The variable here is the time that you have to play, and it is that you do not have. <br><br>I do not think that it is fair to say that EQ does not support the casual gamer. It would be fair to say that someone who has more time to play EQ can advance and acquire at a faster rate. However, is there anything really wrong with that?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009074.html"><b>Discussion of the Week: Continued</b></a><br>I'm impressed with the number of well thought-out discussions taking place in regards to this topic. As many of you have noticed, the size of the original thread has reached the point where it needs to be closed. I still have to go through it and replies to this one as well to compose some comments, which I'll do later today. Until then, here's the continuation of the thread.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008894.html"><b>Weapon Nerfs</b></a><br>Sevrus_MT, <br><br>My initial post on the subject announcing the plans in regards to these weapons said: <br><br>"While we have no problem with weapons of this delay, they should not have been placed as loot on anything other than deity or dragon level encounters." <br><br>The weapon quoted is indeed on such an encounter.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008845.html"><b>20 Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Camping. Why couldn't the "long portion" of the camp be put at the OTHER end of the camp? Perhaps the NPC needs time to "craft" the quest item and changes in some way to show that they are ready to give the reward. Let the other items spawn almost continuously, and people would NEED to camp anything but the reward PC. ]</i></font><br><br>It's a doable idea, but wouldn't this be just a camp by another name? Whether I'm camping a creature that I want to kill, or one I want to talk to, it's still a camp. In this case, I can see 20 people standing around an NPC waiting for him to "be ready" and fighting over who can hand him the items fastest. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Are there currently any suits of armor that give some "hidden" effect or bonus by virtue of wearing the entire suit? ]</i></font><br><br>No, there are not. It's a good idea though that might have some application for later implementation or future products. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. Are there currently any weapons in the game that have any "hidden" effect? ]</i></font><br><br>Not really. What an item can do is expressly stated upon it. We do have some plans for more cursed weaponry in the future, of course we just might have to be creative to "hide" the effect of the curse. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. If the answer to 2 and/or 3 is "no", are there any plans to add this feature to the game? ]</i></font><br><br>See above. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. You once said that GZ was going to conduct some tests with the wizard's spells vs. the other caster classes. Have these been completed? ]</i></font><br><br>Actually I believe that Brad said that, and it is indeed our opinion that offensive power is appropriate for the class. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 6. Why, exactly, was the definition of the wizard class changed on the everquest.com page under the classes section? ]</i></font><br><br>What change and when was it made? To my knowledge, it has read what it reads now since release. I believe that there was a change at one time in the beta period where it was changed from "damage" to "magical damage", but that's all I believe happened. Was there something else? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7. Are there any plans to introduce items that directly influence/enhance trade skills? (Gnomish Jeweler's Loupe, Dwarven Smith's Hammer, Elven Sewing Needle, etc.)]</i></font> <br><br>Do you mean items that allow you to make better items with trades? It's a good idea, but we no firm plans in that direction. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8. Why, since dwarves in fantasy literature (and even in EQ) are the finest smiths in all the realms, is there no ore in Kaladim? It even has a mine. ]</i></font><br><br>Good question. There's no ore in Kaladim? Hmmm, I'll check into that to see if it was a design or an oversight. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9. Why can't enchanters be given a high-level illusion that allows them to change into the nearest ANIMATE object? ]</i></font><br><br>Races are a component of faction, and you adopt whatever race-faction you emulate. There's a lot of special case-coding to handle the animate races that players currently emulate. Opening that up to nearly everything else would be extremely problematic, if not impossible. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 10. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that absorbs magic directed at the wielder, perhaps converting it directly into mana/hit points? ]</i></font><br><br>There is already a bard song that has a damage shield that absorbs magical damage. There's also a cleric "reverse damage shield" that heals anyone that hits the target. That's the extent of what we have, and nothing new along these lines are planned. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 11. Are there any plans to introduce a spell or item that REFLECTS spells back at the caster? ]</i></font><br><br>No. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 12. Why can't the monk-only weapons that look like gloves be worn on the hands, and add directly to the ATTACK stat instead of requiring them to be 1h blunt? ]</i></font><br><br>Items cannot be set to use hand-to-hand skill, and combat can't go to an "equipment" slot to get combat statistics. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 13. If Verant doesn't like "spoiler sites", then why are there no spell descriptions anywhere in the game? ]</i></font><br><br>I think that you've answered your own question. We don't like spoilers. We'd prefer people figure these things out on their own and maintain their own knowledge-base. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 14. Will players ever be able to construct golems? (A.k.a. summon a temporary "golem-type" pet through some complicated quest) ]</i></font><br><br>We could certainly, by use of trade skill or quest, award an item that summoned a pet of any particular type, however we have no plans to do that at present. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 15. Necros can charm the undead; enchanters can charm...well...everything. Will Magicians ever have the ability/spell to charm elementals or other summoned creatures? ]</i></font><br><br>No, we have no plans along these lines at present. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 16. Are there any plans for an expansion geared toward the 10 - 30 range of player rather than the higher levels? ]</i></font><br><br>Velious is geared towards a higher level-range, however Kunark has support for all level ranges. <br><br>With Velious, the thinking is that there is already plenty of content to support the continually migrating portion of the customer-base that is in the 10-30 range. <br><br>I'm unable to talk about any post-Velious plans at this time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 17. The Trackers' Water Extractor - This is currently broken, is it not? The purification tablets do not seem to exist, and the NPC that mentions them won't respond. ]</i></font><br><br>I inquired about this time time back, when Kunark first launched, and it was verified at the time that the tablets do exist. If I need to check into it further, please let me know. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 18. Bandages vs. Aloe Swatches vs. Maneater Plant Salve vs. Tailored Silk Bandages: Is there any difference other than price i.e. More healing, faster healing, etc. ]</i></font><br><br>No difference at this time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 19. Are there any plans to give clerics any type of special ability that is tied to whatever deity they worship? ]</i></font><br><br>No, there are currently no plans along these lines. However, there are plans and implemented pieces of deity-specific quests that return deity-specific rewards. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 20. Are there any races and/or classes that you, personally, would like to see added to the game? ]</i></font><br><br>If we added a warrior/wizard hybrid, could we call him a "fire fighter"?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008814.html"><b>Mez and Bind Wound</b></a><br>I'd agree that being able to bind wounds while mesmerized is a bug. However can someone really bind wounds that much through the duration of the mez to make it much of a big deal? Do the posters feel that this is worth "correcting"? If we do correct it, it won't be on just the PvP servers, but across all of them.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008803.html"><b>Customer Dis-Satisfaction Reduction</b></a><br>Interesting idea. I don't see any issues that would prevent us from putting something like this in. I'll chat with the team about it and see what they think. And for future reference, can we speak of "increasing customer satisfaction" rather than "reducing customer dis-satisfaction" in the future?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008661.html"><b>Bug on Tallon Zek?</b></a><br>I'd have to go with Brega on this one. Personally, whether I lose the cash to another player or destroy it right before death is inconsequential. Giving it some thought, I'd rather they loot it, because I then have a chance to come back and kill them before they have a chance to bank it. <br><br>I don't think that it's enough of an issue to pursue further at this point. Perhaps if others are of the same feelings as the original poster, we can give it some more thought.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008296.html"><b>Guild Accounts at Banks?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Because it would take work.]</i></font> <br><br>Every change takes work, it's just a question of how much work and whether or not the benefits of the change are worth diverting the manpower from other things that they could be working on, and whether the suggested changes are consistant with the game world. <br><br>I think that the suggestion does meet the "consistant with the game world" qualification, but am not sure that it would apply well to the others. Guilds do not currently exist as an entity, but rather as an entry within each character file. In order to implement this, guilds would have to be converted to be an entity all their own. Secondly, restrictions for nodrop and lore items would have to be implemented in ways that would only apply to guild banks. <br><br>It's not just work, but a substantial amount of manpower that's probably better served elsewhere at present. We won't rule it out completely though.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008528.html"><b>Cleric Issue</b></a><br>Though we just gained the ability to restrict items by deity, and could do the same with spells, we really don't have any plans to pursue this idea at present. There's enough issues with class and race balance, without having to likewise balance spells for deities within existing race/class combos.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008653.html"><b>Verant Ruined My Life!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK I am an EQ addict. If I do not play EQ for 16+ hours a day I go mad.<br><br>Wellll. One day I log on and I am missing ALOT of my characters. I relog, they are still gone. Now I panic and petition.<br>After 3-4 hours a guide tells me to contact a GM. After 3 hours the GM comes on and tells me he'll try to get my character back. 2 days later the GM denys they existed and ignores me. OK I just lost of year of my life here! I contact other GMs, I contact higher people in verant. And NO ONE in the whole company will help me it seems.<br><br>I have been playing since beta 3. My account has been active since day 1 of retail. Verant has ruined a year of my life.]</i></font><br><br>Fluffy, <br><br>I'm not sure what's going on in your case, but I've forwarded the thread to the management team in CS. <br>--<br>Secondly, I understand that you are upset about the issue, and I hope that we'll be able to rectify the problem, but I'll have to ask that you stop going around to other threads enaging in flameplay and name-calling.</UL>

The first round was marred by a flurry of rapid<br>AoE Fear jabs by Severilous that sent everyone (including most of the<br>audience of Emerald Jungle native fauna) to run all over, caused a number of<br>players to completely lose composure, and caused the the majority of our<br>casters being dazed for the remainder of the round.  After the rest break,<br>BotS exited their corner with a newfound confidence and regained composure.<br>Severilous tried the same tactics but BotS would have none of it.  BotS<br>eventually landed a blow that sent Severilous crumpling to the leaf covered<br>canvas and down for the count, delivering to Severilous his first ever<br>defeat on The Rathe.<br><br><br>/ooc At our first charge, a number of our players went LD while feared which<br>caused them to be permanently stuck in pathing while feared (LD Looping) and<br>almost all of our casters were fear-bugged.  Most of us were forced to /quit<br>out and return to regroup.  After regrouping and getting a GM to force<br>disconnect on our LD Looping members, we charged again and dispatched<br>Severilous.  Interestingly, some of our people first saw Severilous as a<br>human form that looked like one of our members (Gurney).  I'm not sure how<br>the people who saw him this way corrected the problem.<br>Images can be seen at<br><a href="http://pub3.ezboard.com/fbots74675general.showMessage?topicID=657.topic">http://pub3.ezboard.com/fbots74675general.showMessage?topicID=657.topic</a><br><br>Fitten TallWalker<br>Brotherhood of the Spider<br>The Rathe</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon made a few more posts within the last couple of hours on the Gameplay Board.  Also of note is the start of this week's discussion:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008866.html"><b>Discussion of the Week: Fun</b></a><br>Let&#8217;s talk about &#8220;fun&#8221;. <br><br>Last week I queried everyone&#8217;s thoughts regarding a &#8220;Discussion of the Week&#8221;. Though the number of different responses was almost as great as the number of posts, many of them dealt with fun, or with concepts related to fun. <br><br>I think that it can generally be agreed that EQ&#8217;s customer base is very diverse, and with that diversity comes many different types of players. EQ strives to provide as many different avenues for &#8220;fun&#8221; as possible, leaving it up to the player to make decisions regarding what avenues they wish to pursue. Some find the social aspect of the game to be the most fun, while others have a good time by advancing in levels. Some measure it in items, while others prefer character development along the lines of mastering trade skills or languages. Still others want to personally witness as much as possible within game. <br><br>Our goal with EverQuest is to entertain you for the greatest amount of time possible, and to do this we must provide activities that the players consider &#8220;fun&#8221; in nature. I&#8217;ve spoken many times about the concepts of risk and reward, but those concepts can be broken down to the perception of fun. Setting pure socialization aside, as it is one way of having &#8220;fun&#8221; that does not require a challenge, the goal is that &#8220;rewards&#8221; provide excitement, entertainment, etc. (cf. Fun), to the players that overcome challenges. <br><br>Last week we discussed camping, how it impacts the game, and what the driving forces behind it are. I think that from the responses to that thread, we can agree that camping relates to the concept of &#8220;fun&#8221; in one way or another. Players either enjoy camping itself, or enjoy something that camping will provide, if not the process itself. The social gamer might enjoy camping because of the opportunities for socialization provided in the downtime between kills. The leveling gamer might enjoy the prospect of raising in level. The item gamer looks forward to the items. More indirectly, perhaps the exploring gamer doesn&#8217;t enjoy camping for experience or loot, but gets fun out of exploring new situations, for which they need the levels and items to do, without explicitly caring for those levels or items. <br><br>The questions I&#8217;d like to pose are: <br><br>What is it about EverQuest that entertains you? If you had to label yourself as a particular type of gamer, what would that type be? Though I&#8217;m sure that everyone has particular issues that they feel could use improvement, everyone either has fun in game, or foresees the prospect of having fun sometime in the future. For instance, there are players that feel that once they reach their particular goal (whether it is one of items or levels), they *then* can go have fun. <br><br>If you are of the type that does not feel they are having fun now, and foresees fun once reaching a specific goal, what is that goal? What is it about that goal that makes you feel you can only have fun once you reach it? Internally, we refer to it as a &#8220;comfort-level&#8221;. What defines that comfort-level to you? What do you foresee will be &#8220;fun&#8221; once you&#8217;ve reached that comfort-level? <br><br>When Kunark came out, we raised the level cap. If you define yourself as one who must achieve a comfort level prior to having &#8220;fun&#8221;, did the raising of the level limit also &#8220;raise the bar&#8221; of your comfort level, effectively putting you far below it? Or did you enjoy the level-cap increase? I ask because before the level cap was raised there were thousands of people who were out having &#8220;fun&#8221; in game. Once the cap was raised, the focus for these people quickly shifted back to the &#8220;must-level-fast&#8221; philosophy. <br><br>Assuming that you have &#8220;fun&#8221; outside the tangible effects of levels and items, do you feel that &#8220;fun&#8221; is a just and suitable reward for a risk? Do you have fun outside of the scope of items and levels? Will you give some examples of where you&#8217;ve had fun without a tangible reward? While I understand that players who value only items and levels typically do not have fun outside of the acquisition of those rewards, I would imagine that most fall somewhere in between one player-type an another rather than directly in the middle of one of the ones I&#8217;ve defined. <br><br>If you could make any change to the game, feasible or otherwise, to increase the amount of entertainment you get or fun you have in the game given your particular gaming style, what would that change be? Other thoughts? I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing discussions between the players on their various perceptions of fun. <br><br>This should make for a pretty good discussion. Often here on the boards, we fail to get a good impression of the different types of gamers out there. It&#8217;s not unusual to see two posts on the opposite side of an issue related to &#8220;fun&#8221; claim to both represent the majority. I really doubt there is a &#8220;majority&#8221; for most issues in EverQuest, because as in life, very few things are black and white. <br><br>This is an opportunity to jump in and be heard. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008841.html"><b>Station Security</b></a><br>The connection in which your station name and password is transmitted is a "secure" connection. The boards themselves are not, since there is no reason for them to be. The only personal data that is transmitted after the initial entering of the station name and password is the chat handle, which is not tied to any information that is important for security.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008308-2.html"><b>More on Containers</b></a><br>Another follow-up on this, the database does indeed indicate that the item hasn't been changed since February. That leaves two possibilities, either there's something wrong with the field that's reporting the last date that it was changed, or there was some kind of export problem. More info Monday. <br><br>Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then. <br><br>Also, I notice a couple of people have brought up a thread where I indicated that accidently pressing "Combine" was a risk of using them as a container for item storage. That's true. That is "a" risk, and that was brought up when people were asking for a confirmation window (yes/no requester) when combining. Though that is "a" risk, I don't think that I ever indicated that it was an all-inclusive and balancing risk.</UL>

Gordon posted a few message this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008628.html"><b>Pets Drowning</b></a><br>This is covered in the FAQ. Basically NPCs can do things that PCs can't to make up for the fact that NPCs can't be as intelligent or adaptive as players.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008775.html"><b>Partisan Pack Follow-up </b></a><br>There was another thread that someone started in regards to an item known as the Partisan Pack, a combinable quest bag given out by an NPC. Since that thread has gone a little off-topic, I thought the follow-up which I promised would do better in a new one. <br>Apparently in the last patch, the item changed from a 10-slot container to a 6-slot container, causing some to lose item stored in slots 7-10. <br>Since people have grown accustomed to storing items within quest-bags, a change of this type should have been pre-announced, in order to avoid item loss. We do indeed apologize for the change being made without that advance notice. We have logged data for any items that were lost by the change, so you may contact a GM for assistance.<br><br><br>The original thread on the Partisan pack shifted later to a topic about combinable containers in general. I wanted to separate out the two issues and discuss them individually. I've started a separate thread on the issue concerning the unannounced change of the partisan pack, which is a bag given by an NPC for the purpose of completing a quest. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008807.html"><b>More on Containers</b></a><br>In this thread I'd like to discuss my comments where I said: <br><br>"Concerning items in combinable containers, I think that I'm going to chat with the programmers Monday and see if they can make the containers eat any items in them upon logoff/Linkdeath. I think that there'd be no question of the intent of those bags then." <br><br>After reviewing this post that I made earlier, I do agree that it appears to be a threat when viewed out-of-context, and understand the general reaction that followed. The point of the post was to respond to multiple posts from people earlier in the thread who had no idea that they shouldn't use combinable containers, particularly free bags given by NPCs to complete quests, for general item storage. <br><br>I'd thought that the number of people using the bags for this purpose were the exception rather than the rule, an observation that was apparently mistaken given public response to my post. Given that public response, we won't be taking any steps to "destroy" items in combinable containers upon logout or linkdeath. <br><br>I do apologize for the way my response was phrased and hope everyone understands that neither I nor other members of the tuning team actively seek out ways to make the lives of the players more difficult. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008744.html"><b>Cut EXP Rate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Lets halve XP and Double Heal/Mana Regen It would allow you to take more mobs faster... that means more moving around in dungeons... less down time. more mobs dead. More play time... less down time. You would have to use your time a bit more wisely to make up for the exp cut. You would need to kill things a lot faster to keep the same rate of gain.]</i></font> <br><br>Unfortunately, though the idea looks simple at first glance, it's not that simple. Doubling mana regen rates would at least double the potential killing rate. That means that we'd have to increase spawn rates. At the same time, we'd have to halve loot drop rates for both coin, mundane, and special items. The doubled spawn rates and doubled killing rates would use more processing power and bandwidth on the servers, which isn't feasible from a cost-perspective. <br><br>Finally, the suggested change would only bolster the claim that we "force" people to kill non-stop. I don't believe that is true currently, however might be were we to reduce the time available for social interaction within the game.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008448.html"><b>Cannibalize</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Here i am helping my girlfriend level in FM...she(lvl 28) is fighting things and i(lvl 53) am just casting my slow on them and healing when she needs it. I can be sitting down while she beats the thing to half-way of it's health and it doesn't even notice me, but the second i stand up and cannibalize the things turn on me no matter how bad she taunted it and beat it when i have not casted anything on it but slow at the beginning of the fight]</i></font><br> <br>Since you cast a combat speed debuff on the creature, you were put on the creatures hate list. When you then cast cannabalize on yourself, you are casting a beneficial spell on someone that the creature hates, which causes the amount that it hates you to increase.<br>--<br>The combat speed debuff has duration, so it adds hate each tick that it is on. Beneficial spells add a significant amount of hate (ask any cleric or bard). Both of those issues contribute to the problem that you cite.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008579.html"><b>Warrior Tournament Cancelled?</b></a><br>I'll check with Daegarmo on this tomorrow, see if I can find out what is going on.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008624.html"><b>Gambling in EQ</b></a><br>Though these are good ideas and we have given tremendous thought to them, we elected a while back not to pursue gambling within the game. Frankly, the biggest hurdle is a legal one. Since people are selling in-game items and platinum for real-world cash, it would allow someone to convert their gambling winnings to cash, and cash into a gambling medium. That would leave it open to being argued that gambling in EverQuest is gambling in the real world. <br><br>Though we are leaving the option open for future products, and looking into the legal issues involved, it's not a possibility for EverQuest going forward.</UL>

Ex-OSI employee Raph Koster, now with Verant Interactive, posted on his personal webpage an article called <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/gaming/playerrights.html">Declaring the Rights of Players</a>.  The the name hints, it's focused one what he believes is the rights of the players of MMORPGs.  Here's a snippet:<UL>Do players of virtual worlds have rights? <br><br>One of those questions that given my position, I shouldn't write about. No matter what, any answer I give is bound to be wrong, either from the perspective of my employers or my customers. Heck, even over on the non-commercial side of the fence, it's likely to raise some hackles among hardworking mud admins. <br><br>The pesky thing about rights is that they keep coming up. Players keep claiming that they have them. Admins keep liberally applying the word like some magic balm ("oh, you have every right to be upset&#8230;"), in every circumstance except the ones where the players want the notion of rights taken seriously. Of course, administrators of any virtual space are loathe to "grant players rights" because it curbs their ability to take action against people, restricts their ability to walk away from it all, holds them to standards they may not be able to live up to. </UL>For the rest use the link provided in the above.

Ignitz informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to officially announce the end of the Heroes of Valor month long <br>events calender. All this past month, on each Friday, we planned and held an <br>event and for this last one we decided it was time for our Elder Paladin in <br>the guild, Braxus Silverhand, to receive the second of the Paladin Holy <br>Swords, Soulfire.<br><br>The call went out at 7pm CST for friends to come and join us in the northern <br>portion of the Newbie Area in West Freeport. Within the hour we had almost 20 <br>people there to help take Sir Lucan down. The pull was made, the battle was <br>joined, and within a minute, Lucan, both his human and skeletal form, fell. <br>The Testimony of Truth was looted and the Brilliant Sword of Faith was <br>brought forth out of Northern Freeport. <br><br>We made haste to Southern Karana and found our way into the dungeon of <br>Infected Paw. Many a gnoll sought to prevent us from attaining our goal but <br>not a single one succeeded. Finally, we found ourselves in the jail area of <br>the dungeon, where we stood in front of Brother Hayle and handed him all the <br>items he requested in order to bless Braxus with Soulfire. In the end, Braxus <br>stood before us, the firey blade in hand, and a smile as wide as the world of <br>Norrath on his face.<br><br>But we did not stop there no. The next morning we sought Soulfire once again <br>for another Paladin in our guild, Sanain Fyrestarr. While we did not have as <br>many people there for this Lucan slaying, we did manage to kill him and <br>Sanain received his Soulfire as well. <br><br>For a guild as small as the Heroes of Valor this is truly a magnificent feat <br>and I wish to thank everyone who participated in both slayings. A special <br>thanks goes out to Azoth and Lile, both of whom were there for both slayings, <br>even though they were not part of our guild.<br><br>"May Valor be your Virtue"<br>Ignitz Gemcaller<br>Guildmaster, Heroes of Valor<br>Tribunal Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon kept busy this Sunday by making the following posts on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008505.html"><b>Coffee and Milo</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: What coffee do you drink that hops you up so late at night]</i></font> <br><br>An espresso roast that I order from Seattle. I'm crazy about my coffee, and I've got a pretty nifty setup to make it up :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just find it interesting that you are up again another weekend making posts]</i></font> <br><br>I actually find it a lot easier to be more personable at night away from the office. I guess it's the difference that comes with doing it on my own time by choice rather than as part of my job, even though I'm still doing the same thing. Am I making sense? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Any comments on Milo :/ Really curious, love his column as many others do]</i></font> <br><br>We had to come to grips with the fact that anyone who is known to be working here represents us in public, especially when writing for an EverQuest-related site read by EverQuest customers. Though I am very aware that many people enjoyed the column, there was indeed content that wasn't appropriate from a representative of the company. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008517.html"><b>Gone Campin'</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Too Crowded? I came from half way across the whole game planet just to get to a zone w 7(SEVEN) people in the zone, including me! SO i call ou 46 shaman looking for el groupo!]</i></font> <br><br>If the zone had seven people in it including you, chances are the other 6 were in a group together already. I know that you said later in your post that the other group had 5 members, leaving one solo person. In Lower Guk? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You tell me why anyone should leave a single spawn camp to just get slaughtered by greens waiting to get picked up in a group?]</i></font> <br><br>Because it's more fun than camping a single spawn? <br><br>At 46 I doubt that there is much green to you, and I don't think that there's anything 15 levels below you. I could be wrong about that. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: while i stand invised at the enterence, what happens, someone shouts Train to zone look out, so i run down and to the left out of the way of the train. and stand by till things get cleared up, but no, a wanderer comes by drags the whole freeking train on me, and i loose 46 in less than 6 seconds]</i></font> <br><br>Why did you run from the entrance, deeper into the zone, when someone yelled "train"? You said there were only 7 people in the zone, which is going to make Lower Guk a pretty dangerous place. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is 2 hours, or more at higher lvls, of time wasted due to this meaningless crap acceptable "fun" for you? It sure the hell is not for me!]</i></font> <br><br>Come on Robert. You obviously made some poor decisions here. Why do you come to the boards and blame it on us? The game is supposed to punish you for making mistakes, most games do. You ran solo into a pretty rough dungeon when there were barely any people in there and died. The game worked like it was supposed to. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The game you have created at higher lvls is more about NOT DYING, than it is about playing the game and adventuring!]</i></font> <br><br>That's a decision that you as a gamer make. Why does it have to be about not dying? Why is advancement in level through the boring process of camping a single spawn for experience preferrable to having fun, and not advancing as fast? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You say alot that if there is no risk then it is not exciting, but my point is, when everything involves huge risk of time lost]</i></font> <br><br>This is the second time you've mentioned "lost time" or "wasted time" in the post. The entire concept of "lost time" suggests that there's an end to the game, achieved by advancement. I'm sure that's true for some players. Some feel that they have to reach level 50, or 60 and then they can "finally go out and have fun". Any thing that slows them down is costing them "time", or "lost time" in this case. <br><br>I'm not sure what to tell gamers of this type. I'm not sure that we could ever make advancement fast enough to their liking, but I am sure that we don't want to speed advancement. If all you play for is to advance in level as fast as possible then deaths will equate directly to wasted or lost time. Perhaps if leveling is more important to you than anything else, you should take the fastest and safest route to advancement, which will be camping a single spawn someplace. <br><br>However, if leveling is more important to you than anything else, and you choose to do whatever you have to to level as fast as possible, is it our fault that this is boring? Should not the quickest and safest route to leveling be boring? <br><br>I've said before that risk was necessary in order for there to be a challenge, and a challenge necessary in order for there to be fun. Excitement is one form of fun, and most would agree that boredom is roughly the opposite of excitement. If a gamer makes a choice to remove risk from an encounter, should they not be responsible from removing the fun from that encounter as well?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008521.html"><b>EULA</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just to let you know, you shoulda researched when you did that, it is starting to violate Federal Interstate Wire Fruad laws.]</i></font> <br><br>The EULA doesn't violate any laws, it just defines that you are allowed to do with our software and your access to the service. <br><br>I certainly agree that if player A sells the account to player B, and later steals it back, then player A has committed a crime, but that is between player A and player B, and really has nothing to do with us. <br><br>The extent that we get involved is to ban the account if player B calls us up and proves that he bought it from player A. We do not however compensate player B in any way, since he acquired access to the account through a violation of the user agreement by player A. It is then player B's option to file legal charges if they wish, but that doesn't involve us. <br><br>See, this is why we don't allow account transers, because we can't be responsible for all the fraud that goes on. Someone might look reputable on those auction sites, but takes only a couple of days and costs a couple of dollars to work up a convincing profile. There is more fraud involved in account and item sales than you can possibly imagine. I wish I could tell you how many calls we get every day about this.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008502.html"><b>Sharing Accounts</b></a><br>There's no problem if that person is your child, however if it's anyone else, it's not permitted by the EULA.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008372.html"><b>A Bug?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I play on the tribunal and informed a guide about the presence of this bug and was told they are investigating the problem.

Since the last patch the msg "You are allready invisible" is given when attempting this. Could you please give an update so we know if this bug has even made it too the right people and when it might be completed. Thank You Much]</i></font> <br><br>It's not a bug. No class (except for rogues) can be invisible to both living and undead regardless of spells or abilities. So even though the spells would appear to stack, the recipient of the spell would only be under the affect of one spell. <br><br>A few weeks ago, I asked the coder to make the spells unstackable so that they didn't give the impression that being invisible to both is possible.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008422.html"><b>Tinnkering</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ther have been countless upon countless threads started to get some idea of when Tinkering will gets its upgrade.

Also, I can't say that I agree that a dungeon design of that nature constitutes a penalty. <br><br>There are of course dungeons which don't allow people to gate out already, but there's really no point in expanding that to dungeons that already allow it by design.

Gordon made a few posts today on the Gameplay Board.  For your information here they are:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008239.html"><b>AoE Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Long promised, never delivered, non-class issue.  Well Gordon? When are pre-50 AoE spells going to be fixed?]</i></font> <br><br>What promise? I don't recall anyone promising anything in regards to these spells. <br><br>Furthermore, how are these spells "broken" in your opinion? I've seen a number of posts complaining about damage ratios, or regarding the number of creatures that they hit, or the types of creatures that are affected. It's all working as intended as far as I can tell. <br><br>Can you elaborate on "broken" and include what spells you are speaking of? Please be as brief as possible while explaining the situation. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008246.html"><b>Summaries of Weekly Discussion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: A (the) conclusion(s) that Verant has come to in regards to the topic based on the discussion?]</i></font> <br><br>If whatever we are discussing has a solid conclusion, sure, but I think that most of what we'll discuss will be a little more intellectual and a little less tangible in nature. <br><br>As far as camping goes, about all we determined is that people differ widely in opinion on the issue. One of the most common suggestions is that we work actively to promote more rewards for playing the game in the preferred manner, and leave rewards as they currently exist for camping. <br><br>Unfortunately, doing that would require making playing the game in the preferred manner easier, safer, faster, or more profitable, which would in our opinion decrease the fun to be had from it. In our opinion, there is more fun to be had from playing the game in the preferred manner than by camping, and that fun should be the sufficient additional reward to get people to do it. <br><br>However it's obviously not, so we're left with reducing the reward for camping as an option. Of course, many made it clear in the threads they they prefer camping over doing anything else in the game. Hence our quandry. <br><br>I think that at this point we can continue trying new ideas going forward, but try to avoid making sweeping changes to the way existing things work. We'll of course have individual exceptions to the philosophy in both directions, but on an as-needed basis. That said, there were some very good ideas included and good insight offered within the thread. Even if those ideas aren't something that would work in EQ, they are still something that we can keep in mind for future products.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008308.html"><b>"Lets make that 10 slot bag 6 slots and dump the 4 items in the deleted slots!"</b></a><br>I'm not at all familiar with this change; I'll look into it Monday. That said, if the item was a combinable item used for a Quest, people are not supposed to store items in combinable containers. <br>--<br>Just a follow-up with this... One of the guys is still in the office, and tells me that our records indicate that the last time this item was modified was in February. When is the change supposed to have taken place?<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008319.html"><b>New Dragons?</b></a><br>Dragons and deities are kind of a rite of passage in EverQuest. They are a goal that people aim for when playing the game. We wouldn't want to cheapen the experience by giving every level range their "own" dragon.</UL>

A new event was just announced for the Morell-Thule server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Friends at EQVault! <br><br>One night in a dream Dolumar heard a cry and saw the terrified face of <br>young and niave Elf waylaid by a vulgar, unscrupulous Orc. <br>He bolted up out of his retreating place, and drew us together for a special <br>meeting, we his friends and guildmates of Random Acts. <br><br>"We must away to the forest, and anon," he said, speaking of <br> the deep dark forest of Faydwer, home to the elves and other <br>folke. "I fear there are many young ones afraid to walk the paths between <br>Kelethin and Felwithe. Only the boldest venture forth these days, <br>and that is for the noble task of carrying the mail. "We must <br>hurry...there is no time to lose. They will perish soon if we <br>don't!" <br><br>"Yes, but Dolumar,"  Hamadryad, the guildleader, said. "We <br>must take time to plan a journey such as this...how will they <br>know we are coming? What of our reinforcements?" <br><br>"When the young and innocent are dropping all around you, <br>it is not time to plan. It is time to act! Are we not of Random Acts, <br>the Champions of Kind Deeds toward all in need! I have seen <br>it in my dream...they call us!" <br><br>Hamadryad sought the inner guide for the energies behind her <br>dear friend's words. She closed her eyes and saw Dolumar <br>standing on the central lift to Kelethin, raising his staff to <br>protect a young one from a pack of venomous Orcs, while the <br>guards stood idly by. Dolumar is bathed in light! she saw in <br>her vision. <br><br>"You speak the Truth," Hamadryad said to Dolumar, and grasped <br>his shoulder. "Let us leave now with no more planning. We will <br>send out messengers for reinforcements, and by Tunare's Will <br>they will arrive before we are spent. But if we must go down," <br>she said, looking around the room at the few valient and brave <br>fellows who were marching into danger for people they didn't <br>even know, "if we must go down fighting, then I am honored to be in <br>your company." <br><br>"Away to Faydwer! Let us start in Greater Faydark. Away!" <br><br>World: Morell-Thule <br>What: Greater Faydark First Aid Camp <br>Where: Greater Faydark newbie areas <br>When: Saturday, Aug. 26, 8:00AM Pacific <br>Why: Because people are dropping like <br>flies out there and it's our job to <br>help them. <br>Who: You! and bring a friend! <br><br><a href="http://www.stas.net/randomacts/">http://www.stas.net/randomacts/</a> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Ariel announced that Trakanon has met his match again:<BLOCKQUOTE>The undead dragon Trakanon has been the Nemesis of the Legacy of Steel for<br>several weeks now. On our first sojourn into his lair we merely sparred with<br>the mighty dragon in order to better guage his weaknesses. Another hazardous<br>adventure led to the zone crash of Old Sebilis. Undaunted, we traveled once<br>again down to his subterranean cavern. Fungal Reavers, Reet Knights and The<br>Sebilite Protector were all unable to deter us from our goal. With a sense<br>of dread and antipation, the forces of Legacy of Steel approached the bridge<br>to Trakanon's Lair and awaited the call to charge. From the ledge above a<br>raging tide of Sebilite Juggernauts rushed at us, attempting to knock us<br>from our precarious perch. After a quick and furious battle, the Juggernauts<br>were defeated and our companions prepared themselves mentally and<br>spiritually for what would be our greatest hour. <br><br>At the eleventh hour, I gave the order to 'CHARGE!', all the while hoping<br>that I was not, once again, sending my friends to their certain doom. At the<br>back of his cavernous lair, Trakanon caught sight of us and reared up to<br>envelop our fellowship with his deadly, venemous breath. Not one of us<br>faltered; but instead our entire company re-doubled its<br>efforts - Warriors, Monks and Paladins rushed the beast head-on even as our<br>green robed Wizards and Mages rained fireballs upon his gargantuan body. The<br>battle was short but furious. Yet, at the end, the raging beast that had<br>haunted us for weeks... had fallen. Some of our company felt elation, others<br>excitement for the treasures that were gained from the Dragon's horde. As<br>for me, I merely felt relief that the beast was beaten at last...<br><br>Ariel<br>GM Legacy of Steel<br><br>and some pic links:<br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Trakdead.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Trakdead.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/trakdead1.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/trakdead1.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/mudcrush.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/mudcrush.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Tolon.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Tolon.jpg</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Pickle:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi Guys,<br><br>Act 1 has finally been completed, but is now called the Prologue! You can access it by clicking on the "Completed Acts" link above. <br><br>After much discussion on what we should do re: dialogue and narration, we decided that it be best to keep it to a minimum. Thus, a small blurb is included in the beginning of the act, and the rest of the movie should tell itself. Furthermore, we've included a synopsis of what *exactly* is going on throughout the movie in the download page, and after reading this, the story should be clear.<br><br>Also added onto this act is the movie's opening title and credit sequence. I wanted to make some a bit bad-ass and energetic, to contrast from the 8 minute battle sequence, and hope this is a good compliment.<br><br>Also, if anyone can mirror the zip file, please let me know at pickle@eqmovie.com so I can add the link.<br><br>I hope you enjoy!<br>-Pickle<br><a href="http://www.eqmovie.com/">http://www.eqmovie.com/</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon has been making his normal rounds on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's a rundown of all of today's posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008205.html"><b>More Deletions on Offical Boards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I, for the life of me, can't see how "board" posts, have ANY THING to do with "game conduct" though]</i></font> <br><br>The ability to post on these boards is one of the privileges that go with having an EverQuest account. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you conduct yourself poorly here, why allow you into the game where you will conduct yourself poorly infront of even more? Flaming and name callers here arent welcome here nor ingame. Seems fine to me.]</i></font> <br><br>That's basically where we are coming from. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008235.html"><b>How is Damage calculated?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. We know each weapon has has a damage and a dely<br>2. But we also know there is a level bonus that affects each hit.<br>3. We also know that str makes max damage go higher and possibly make you hit for max damage more often.<br>What we dont know is exactly how these fit together.]</i></font> <br><br>That is as intended. As I've said before, we're not going to publish the formulae used to determine what happens in combat. If you need to know more, you'll have to extrapolate from the data that you do have. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think casters would be shocked if their 1600 hp nuke actually only landed for 800 and cost twice as much mana]</i></font> <br><br>Casters can see how much DD spells hit for per hit, in the same fashion that melee players can see how much their sword hits for on each hit. Information is given equally in that respect. If the casters however wanted to see the formulae that determines things such as fizzle and resist rates, we'd have to decline to give that info out as well. <br><br>DOTs are even more mysterious than weapons or DDs. In fact, the only reason people have a good idea of the way that most of these work is due to the parsing of the spell data file. This is obviously something that we didn't intend. Since that information is gathered via unauthorized means, we're not going to extend that out to a purposeful action such as handing out formulae. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Weve come a long way from damage/delay, but some exact formulas for calculating damage would be appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm wondering if this is leading to something else, as I know you've been here on the boards long enough to know what I'd say to this request :)<br><br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008197.html"><b>Retroactive Nerfs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are Retroactive nerfs EVER justified? <br>I used to agree with the idea of using nerfs to maintain balance in the game....but lately they seem to do more harm than good, (i.e. moss-covered twig / manastone / rubicite issues / Jboots) ]</i></font><br><br>Rubicite and Jboots were not changed retroactively. The manastone only had a small part of it changed retroactively (see below). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Heh heh....Verant seems to like retroactive nerfs....]</i></font> <br><br>Actually we really dislike doing them, however sometimes an item is so unbalancing that it's necessary. Here's some examples of where we haven't done a retroactive change: <br><br>Manastone (One component was retroactive with this, it being disallowed in the Planes)<br>Box of Abu'kar (This one started as a retroactive change that was then changed back to the way it was)<br>Guise of the Deceiver<br>Lusterous Russet Armor (We announced an intended retroactive change, then changed our minds)<br>Rubicite <br><br>Likewise, there are cases where a retroactive change was necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm starting to think that VI should just leave whatever mistakes they made in the game and end the drops if necessary. It just seems like something is innately wrong with retroactive changes, and they usually come much to the chagrin of the players.<br><br>What do you guys think? For better or worse, I'm of the belief that the policy should be no more retroactive nerfs]</i></font> <br><br>I think that you'll find people on both sides of the issue. Many felt that the Manastone and Guise should have been retroactively removed. Many feel that the twig and other low-delay weapons shouldn't be retroactively changed. I guess it depends on whether or not you are going to be a recipient of a retroactive change.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008182.html"><b>An Explanation</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So agian I was just wondering what is the different between the song and this.]</i></font> <br><br>The difference is that the NPC is moving. It is carrying out its commands and making progress towards that goal. Movement introduces a variable that injects some risk into the situation. Now where these particular people were fear-kiting, perhaps there is a pathing issue that reduces the risk, but that's something associated with a specific point in the world, not an ability that can be taken anywhere. <br><br>The "Fear" spell tells the NPC to flee. It's the same "flee" that they do when they run low on health and try to get away. They can't really *get* anywhere, so the only reason they flee is to inject additional risk. <br><br>An NPC that is fleeing, and is then rooted, will turn around and fight. An NPC that is fleeing, and then snared, will not turn around and fight, even if their movement rate is reduced to zero (an effective root). "Effective Roots" don't have the drawbacks of a root (e.g. fighting NPC, unpredictable breaking of the spell). <br><br>Our choices in this case were: Make it so all NPCs will fight back if their movement speed is reduced to a certain point, or, limit the ability of snare spells to reduce their movement rate to zero. We did the latter. I'm sure that some could make a case for the former based upon situation.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008188.html"><b>We Need More Abashi's!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyways do you think with all that EQ income that the players generate you could hire some EQ know it alls to respond to more posts??]</i></font> <br><br>It's not so much answering questions about how things work in EQ as it is understanding why things were set up as they are in the first place. It's my hope that some day I'll be able to convince everyone of our goals and get complete buy-in. I know that's not really possible, but I can hope :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive posted many times here, sometimes griping, sometimes praising, and sometimes role playing and my post has never been answered by you or any staff, it kinda makes me feel very small and unimportant, especially when i put alot of time and thought in a new idea or gripe or whatever.]</i></font> <br><br>The board gets 400-500 new threads per day with about 10 times that many posts. I think that the point that we can start answering everyone's posts will be about the same time that EQ has lost popularity. Until then we'll try to address issues if not individual posts. <br><br>Thanks for posting :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008181.html"><b>Autosplit Problems</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) convert P to G and resplit (what they obviously don't want to do);]</i></font> <br><br>Autosplit used to work like this (beta), and people *hated* it. They always ended up with far too many of a lesser valued coin. Not to mention, it doesn't make sense that change can be made out in the wilderness. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) remove "feature" (what they should do).]</i></font> <br><br>Why remove a feature that people can just choose not to use? Personally, I've never had a problem with autosplit, as it works out in the long run. <br><br>Things you can do: <br>-Master loot. Have one guy loot everything with autosplit off. Split after you all are done adventuring. <br>-Alpha loot. Take turns looting with autosplit on. Everything will even out in the long run.<br>-Alpha loot with split off. <br><br>-or.. Just don't worry about it. A coin here or there isnt' really that big of a deal, and if it is for you, you can still choose not to use autosplit.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008144.html"><b>Anti-Roleplaying Server Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My server is tyring to change to all RPing. Well i dont agree with this. i like to powergame and not thing. <br>anyway i personally dont like to RP. i RP myself and enjoy it sometimes. but i feel out of place sometimes<br>Anyway. since my server is one of the newest two. (morell thule, torvantilus (sp)) i was curious if it gets to bad if i could switch to a more powergaming server like xegony. NOOO im not going to start over and play the next 5 months getting to where i am. i have 43 levels under my belt. if im not happy its not that hard to do. i mean the internal staff does it all the time.]</i></font> <br><br>Honestly this is one of the most unusual requests I've seen. <br><br>Frankly, we move characters during sanctioned server-moves. I don't think that we would want to expand our current moves to include those that want to move because there is "too much roleplaying" on their current server.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008141.html"><b>Low Delay Weapon Debate</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: "I assume you are speaking of the low-delay weapons? Items attainable in the mid 30s should not be the preferred item at 60."]</i></font> <br><br>Oops. I meant weapons, not items in general. Many items have varying degrees of usefulness throughout the life of the character. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: ENTIRE shiverback debate was due to this exact fact]</i></font> <br><br>I'll agree that Shiverback isn't as good as some of the other more mundane stuff that is out there. However, we're all but certain here that the problem is not necessarily with Shiverback being poor, but with some of the mundane stuff being too good. <br><br>Jeff Butler is running some extensive inter-class defense tests, and the initial indication is that any defensive increase (including AC) for monks would not be appropriate.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008172.html"><b>The Missing Threads</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: HA DELETED MY CUSTOMER SERVICE POST!!]</i></font><br> <br>You mean the post at <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008061.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008061.html</a> ? <br><br>It's several pages back by now.

Your last post had it's last reply around 5am this morning. It wasn't deleted, you might want to check out the search function. <br><br>As for your issue, it certainly sounds a bit strange, but I can't look into a thing without names. I do find it highly unusual that a GM would accidentally summon you to your death in Fear 5 times while trying to help you. <br><br>Have you tried talking to the GM on the server since then, other than through email? Has the one who accidentally got you killed 5 times while trying to help you been on the server at all? I really need some more information<br>---<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: as long as we are discussing deleted posts...where are these? <br><br> <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007908.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007908.html</a>  Title: Abashi, Aradune, etc: Just how the hell was the song "over powered?" ]</i></font><br><br>The thread degenerated into rampant personal attacks. As these posts were the rule rather than the exception in the thread, the entire thread was deleted. They were especially bad since it seemed that people were trying to "one-up" each other with the level of personal attack being made. Personal attacks do not belong on these boards. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007933.html">http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007933.html</a> Title: Abashi, Why Did Verant Ask for Our Opinion on PVP then Go Directly Against It?]</i></font> <br><br>Thread got corrupted.

The moderators are instructed to delete threads any time the poster of the thread violates the rules. <br><br>As for the index, the index is rebuilt regularly.

It offered us some some extra insight into player thoughts and feelings that will certainly contribute to our ability to make fun and exciting games. <br><br>I'd like to start a similar "Discussion of the week" thread every Monday, and come back to request ideas for the following week's thread every Friday. So here's the request for ideas! <br><br>Some guidelines: <br><br>1. No class-specific or class-type specific (melee/hybrid/casters) threads.<br>2. The ideas must be something of interest to a wide range of players.<br>3. I'd like to stay more on the course of broad gaming concepts rather than specific issues. For instance, I'd rather talk about concepts such as last weeks concerning camping than "Loot in lower guk". <br><br>Post your thoughts here, I'll pick a concept based on the responses here. </UL>
