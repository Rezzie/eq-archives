I just received moments ago this note from John Smedley concerning the server problems that have troubled EverQuest this week:<UL>Hello All,<br><br>We apologize for the problems we've been having this week. Basically it was<br>a nasty server side bug that we now believe we have tracked down and<br>eliminated (there's always the chance that this wasn't the problem). The<br>approach we are taking now is to load the new code onto the servers one by<br>one so as not to cause downtime to the entire game like we have the last 3-4<br>days. Everything should be back to normal soon.<br><br>John Smedley<br>Chief Operating Officer<br>Sony Online Entertainment</UL>Thanks John!

The Developer's Corner was updated by Alan several times throughout the day:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying Or Just Playing?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is an easy question for me.. I just play. I play EQ to be with my friends, and some of them LOVE to roleplay. You see, I have a problem. My friend told me to buy this game because it was cool, so I did. I have NO CLUE how to roleplay, I would love to, but I don't know how. Also, I would end up looking like a fool if I started to roleplay in front of a ton of people that don't. <br><br>Maybe if I could learn how, or if I was around a lot of RPers I would. I'm seriously considering trying it, but I just can't now. :(<br><br>EQ is a great game role playing or not, but I feel that role playing would add a lot to the game for me. <br><br>-Chris aka JarasayIsMyHero<br>Mith Marr<br>Relzon 11 Human Rogue<br>Reznur 10 Human Monk<br>Banjanjas 22 Halfling Warrior<br>Kizak 20 Barbarian Warrior<br>Jindrak 13 Erudin Necro <br><br>Yes, I love to play many different characters.. And Jarasay deserves a promotion. :)]</i></font><br><br>I've heard that sort of thing before. You're not alone in thinking that you don't know how to roleplay and that you would feel silly doing it. <br><br>Most people already know how to roleplay. A lot of us roleplay at work (we act like we enjoy our jobs&#8230;) or when meeting the girlfriends parents (we act like a responsible person&#8230;). It's not a hard thing to do, and everyone can do it. There is no requirement to be clever, or funny, or silly, or any other such thing. All you have to do is try to think like your character. <br><br>I've always told people that if you want to start roleplaying, build a character that would think and act a lot like you already think and act. If you are a jovial person that tries to see the good in things, then make that the personality of your character. The only 'trick' to roleplaying is to allow yourself to think as if you were really a citizen of Norrath. That citizen can have all of the same principles and values that you do. But he doesn't know about your favorite baseball team. He does know about the way that people treat him in Neriak or in Qeynos, and that matters to him. <br><br>As for looking silly, don't worry about it. You said yourself that you think it seems like fun. You see others doing it and to you they don't look silly. And, well, it isn't silly. It's fun. Personally, I think people look silly when they dance&#8230; <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think one of the things I keep in perspective when roleplaying, is the goal of the thing. Granted, roleplaying does hamper my advancement a bit- but my goal isn't to make it to level 60. That, is something that will/won't happen over the course of each of my character's lives. The goal is, when I /camp desktop at the end of the day, am I smiling? Did I enjoy my day? <br><br>So.. my barbarian warrior has a nifty collection of rusty weapons taking up valuable space. I mean, look how nice and sharp they are! And.. a library card from Erudin, because he wants people to know he is NOT ignorant. After all, he as this here card for books (which he looted). My high elf paladin curses the idiocy of the squirrel-elves who fail to make a proper wall, then runs and argues with the orc lift guards in Kelethin for their slow reactions to threats. Or my wood elf ranger's penchant for casting all healing spells on others, watching his life line ebb away while poisoned. <br><br>So, yes, I give up a lot of opportunity for experience, I have useless items, I haven't maximized my equipment and Tunare knows, my poor ranger is a crunched bit of Orcbreakfast to quote my favorite bard. But.. I'm having a wonderful time. <br><br>And by the way, thank you for the wonderful graphics all over the world. My ranger stood in awe, exploring all of Steamfont that first trip there, admiring the geysers. <br><br>Agramor Treewalker<br>24th season ranger of Tunare<br>Karana Server ]</i></font><br><br>Excellent. You're right, the real thing to do is to make sure that when you're done playing at the end of the day, you felt like you were playing, having fun. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said: "Though I would like a server that encouraged people to avoid abbreviations in public chat. How in the world you'd do that properly, I don't know." <br><br>humor<br>This is easy. You add a grammar and spell checker to the EQ client and have it parse every sentence the player types in. You then grant xp for every sentence with no errors. :)<br>/humor <br><br>Thanoslug Barukhazad<br>Singing Paladin of Brell Serilis<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>Yikes. Charge us with the responsibility of creating a grammar checker that actually works! There isn't one on the market yet, so I suppose we'd be able to make a fortune selling it as a secondary product&#8230; :)<br><br>And, worse yet, we'd need 14 of them&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Ne Patch Feature Comments</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, <br><br>Had a chance to test most of the new patch features (as much as a 28 enchanter can)and I am imensly impressed, thanks to you and your team! =) <br><br>I have 2 comments reguarding new features however: <br><br>1: /charinfo; can this be extended to include the number of kills and deaths attributed to the PC? <br><br>2: Container Placement; As only 2 containers may be open at any one time, it would be nice to just save the location for [open container 1] and [open container 2]. <br><br>Finally, one bug I found related to new container changes: (told the QA team about it too, just passing it on as a warning to others): <br><br>If you do NOT use Screen Same Resolution (makes your non-full screen view smaller) then if you open bags in full screen and place them near the edge, then switch screens to non-full screen your bags will be locked in the void outside the interface and you'll have to ESC out of your inventory and start over. <br><br>Thank you all again for taking the time to not only read but implement our ideas =) <br>/hug dev team <br><br>Azmira Ani<br>Legion of the Vale (.com) ]</i></font><br><br>Well, thanks! But I don't do the work, so I'll pass on your hug to the team (though not literally&#8230;). <br><br>I really don't think we would want to track the number of kills a character made. First of all (and to me most importantly), this isn't a first person shooter. We're not emphasizing any sort of scoring system here. Secondly (and probably most importantly for our programmers), there tracking the number of kills you get is another bunch of data that we would have to track along with your character, and that's not something we want to do unless it's important to the game. And as you can see by my first point, it really isn't. <br><br>And the answer to your second point is similar. As it is now, we only have to track the location that each inventory slot opens to. That's about 16 pieces of information per character (17 if we get around to world containers&#8230;). If we had to track this for each bag, we'd have to store it on the bags. So each bag would have to know where each person that holds it wants it to open&#8230; <br><br>And as it is now it's just as useful as having the information attached to the bag.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000113.html"><b>Key Mapping Bug</b></a><br>Crism_KotWR wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have recently started using mouse control more often in Eq. So I have mapped movement keys to W, A, S, and D. At the same time I also use CTRL-S and CTRL-D religeously. Unfortunately, when I press CRTL-S not only do I stand up, but I also take a step backwards. So both the CTRL-S map and the S map are happening at the same time. If you press CTRL or ALT with a key, then that should not execute the event mapped to just the letter key. Sounds like a simple fix, but just annoying. I guess I could remap sit to CTRL-Z but then that would treat the symptom and not the problem. ]</i></font><br><br>I sent your concern to the programmers, and I was deluged with responses&#8230; Rowyl's was, for once, the shortest and most concise, so here it is: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The problem is that we allow people to hold control why moving to allow for strafing. We can't make is to that CTRL-S doesn't move backwards without causing problems for people that just hold CTRL down while moving in order to strafe. They would have to release CTRL to backup... <br><br>He just needs to remap his sit key (that's what I did since I use the W A S D setup for moving). ]</i></font><br><br>So, really, the only solution would be for you to remap your sit key (or your movement keys&#8230;). It's not a bug, it's just the way it is.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000112.html"><b>Special Food Items & Eating Food</b></a><br>I need to make a correction to something I've said about eating food by right-clicking and about the way that special food items work. <br><br>Right-clicking a food item only sends out the message that you've eaten something. It does not confer any of the special properties that the food may have. And the food will only last half as long as it would if eaten naturally. <br><br>The special foods will give you their benefit as long as they are the food that you are currently eating, meaning as long as it is the first food in your inventory. <br><br>I was mistaken in how I thought this worked, and I have been giving you the wrong information about it.

The cat-people of Odus were dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites during the process of their segregation. They do not call themselves "Kerrans". The cat people of Luclin are actually known as the "Vah Shir", the nobility among the cat people. The tale of how they ended up on Luclin is pretty interesting, but I'll leave that for the web site :)<br><br>As for your other questions, yes, other races will be able to become Beastlords, but there are certain limitations involved.

More mayham and madness to report that occured on the Developer's Corner today:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000099.html"><b>Sneaking Hiding and You</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I can agree with Absor on most points in this discussion. However there is one point that I cannot reconcile with the explainations. The ranger is a master of the wilderness. He is the master tracker and can tell how big and bad a creature is by smelling it on the air. He above all others should have the sneak/hide combination "In A Wilderness Setting". So you don't allow in in cities, dungeons, etc. that's fine and reasonable. But, when it comes to the great outdoors, no one should be able to move undetected about better than a ranger. Even if you don't give them the message they should still be able to do both at the same time. <br><br>Being trained for a lifetime on how to get close to animals without spooking them Rangers would have to be able to sneak/hide in the wilderness. Rogues are trained on how to sneak/hide from "people" if anything their ability should be deminished when in the rangers world of the outdoors trying to hide from animals/monsters. I am not suggesting that the Rogues be nerfed in the wilderness, only that the ability combination be give to rangers on their home turf. <br><br>JackMagist ]</i></font><br><br>I'm not trying to convince you that a ranger wouldn't be good at hiding in a wilderness setting. I don't disagree with the idea at all. <br><br>I'm telling you that the reason that rogues get the ability to sneak and hide at the same time and nobody else does is simply because that's one of their special perks. <br><br>It's pretty easy to justify a lot of things in a roleplaying game. I can justify any class/race combination you can think of with some simple roleplaying setup. For example, Ogre bards: Ogres have an innate sense of rhythm. Their music is not complicated, but it is powerful. And because the have no written language, the bards of their culture are the focus of all of their lore, keepers of their tales and their myths&#8230; <br><br>I can just as easily claim that rogues should be very good trackers, at least as good as rangers, and certainly better in an urban setting. But they don't get that skill in the game because of game balance, because giving tracking to too many classes dilutes the skill. <br><br>Anyway, my point isn't that rangers would suck at hiding and sneaking. My point is that they don't get it because rogues are the only ones that do. <br><br>Raean7 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Incoming!

For now, it's all rather hush-hush. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000019.html"><b>Roleplaying or Just Playing?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: One other issue I have with the roleplaying server is that I believe it will restrict people from other countries or with language barriers from enjoying those servers. If you have difficulty understanding normal english then you will certainly be overwhelmed with the mangled ole'english that people tend to adopt when roleplaying. <br><br>As well, I understand that r u there and plz and all of the abbreviations in game are associated with leet dewds or whatever, but they are also adopted because of the technology. I am a pretty competent typer. So I can throw out big words and sentences in game without having the other person sit around and wait half an hour for a reply. But many folks who rely on the hunt and peck method may take forever to reply to you. I'd rather get an abbreviated response back in a short period of time that addresses the issue or question or whatever, than wait 5 minutes for them to write out a complete sentence. The point gets across fine whether you abreviate it or not. People are quick to associate this to laziness or childishness or wanna be leetness as opposed to other factors which could force someone to abbreviate or drop words from sentences. And in a roleplay server they will be punished for a language barrier. Doesn't seem very fair to me. <br><br>Biz. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, actually, I don't know anyone that roleplays in Norrath that uses any form of 'ole' english'. In fact, I've never heard it used in any roleplaying game I've ever attended. <br><br>But typing is a barrier to roleplaying in a computer game. It does slow down the conversation. But there is no rush to hurry up and roleplay. <br><br>And I suppose rules created for a roleplaying server could punish people for such things, but that wouldn't be a very fun server, now would it? <br><br>We're way ahead of ourselves talking about a roleplaying server in any solid form. But I wouldn't advocate any server that would punish people for misspelling a word. Though I would like a server that encouraged people to avoid abbreviations in public chat. How in the world you'd do that properly, I don't know. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000101.html"><b>Random Rolls</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Cheating on rolls might not always be a matter of hacking the algorithm. A player once demonstrated to me how he could fake a random roll fairly convincingly. The text of the roll message is fixed except for the roll value and the high-low limits. So all this player did was enter a /shout command (to get the red text) and enter the right number of spaces to get a blank line (as I recall) after his "shout", then add a fake roll message. So it looked like <br><br>Rollfixer shouts "Come on, 100! <br><br>Rollfixer rolls a magic die ...." <br><br>Maybe not too sophistocated a method of cheating, but with half a dozen players rolling at once, it might pass muster. <br><br>OutlawEyes ]</i></font><br><br>There will always be people trying to do things like that. The system is as foolproof as we can make it. Such tricks will always exist. In this case the way to defeat it is to read the message. We can't make it much simpler than that. <br><br>It's a good warning to people to keep their eyes open to things like this.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000054.html"><b>/Assist</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Why /assist %t? <br><br>I hope that they mean /assist playername. <br><br>I would love to be able to set up an assist hotkey that only assists the puller, instead of who I have targeted. Or perhaps a way to do /assist <F1-6> so I could just assign /assist to a specific groupmember. <br><br>I thought a while back that you could do /assist <playername>, but it has not worked for me at all recently, and until I played a Monk, had no idea how usefull /assist was. (hehe, so I wind up solo alot with my Necro. I am better now :)) <br><br>--Necridious ]</i></font><br><br>/assist <charactername> works fine, used it plenty last night. Have a hotkey for each of the people that might need assistance that just does /assist Bobo (no, Bobo is not a real character name). <br><br>%t is the replacement variable for the name of your current target. You should not need to use this in conjunction with /assist, since assist without an argument should assist whoever is your current target. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan said.. <br><br>"Why would you type /assist %T when you can target and then just type /assist" <br><br>The player didn't specify, but I'd assume it was a hotkey. I have /assist %T as part of a multi-line hotkey that does some other stuff :)  makes life much easier for me, would be nice if it was fixed to work again (and the difficulty in targeting players when they're crowded with mobs is about one of the most aggravating things about EQ) <br><br>Cairin Hairytoes - 29 druid &#8211; Test ]</i></font><br><br>But that's where the confusion comes in. /assist and /assist %t do exactly the same thing. I know that /assist works peachy, I've used it a lot recently. So rewrite your hotkey without the %t and see how it works.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Deities and Expansion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I was rereading this thread, and then read the dieties section on the main page (nice; was it there before and I missed it, or is it new?) <br><br>Anyway, I got to Zebuxurok, the little-known-about demi-god. <br><br>I found the second paragraph the most interesting:<br>"There is said to be a hidden city on Norrath that honor, not worship, the 'Ungod', Zebuxoruk. Something not even he truly cares for. This city has knowledge of his history both true and false and the community is mostly comprised of fallen priests, shadowknight, paladins, any who have been forsaken by thier deities and either seek a pathway back or seek true neutrality among the planes and and understanding that the deities are more mortal than they think." <br><br>Two observations, comment if you like. <br><br>1) I smell an expansion with a new city (could it be Luclin?) Somehow I think not, but could be wrong. I'm sure you don't have a comment on this one yet. <br><br>2) I smell a quest involving this city to alter your religion. <br><br>Sniff, sniff. Any comments? <br><br>Jynx ]</i></font><br><br>I don't have a comment about that directly. I do want to tell you that Norrath was already a pretty well fleshed out world before EverQuest went live (before that even). There a tons of things that exist in the mythology that we may never have time to create in the game itself. That's one sign of a good world, at least to me. <br><br>So if you see hints of interesting things in the mythology of Norrath, you're seeing the results of a created universe, not necessarily a plan for a future zone or quest. Sure, that's where we draw that stuff from, but we're not going to pretend it doesn't exist until we can put it in game. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "A Wan Ghoul Knight was struck by the judgement of Tunare." <br><br>I like the idea... I can only foresee 4 problems here... <br><br>"Tunare was struck by the Judgement of Tunare!" There are some sickos (jk) that decide to go against their god, and kill him/her. (Cazic, Innoruuk, Tunare and Bristlebane) It would look slightly silly if they were killed by their own powers... Perhaps it should be so that you can only go against your own god if you change deiety...? <br><br>Noor :)]</i></font><br><br>I admit it, I laughed at this.</UL>

Banegrivm brings us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>For those who do not know, it has been seen that a state of war will be <br>coming to pass. It seems the plot thicks a bit as many of the heroes of lore <br>have appeared in a recent raid into Castle Mistmoore. As well there are now <br>implications of Dragons from the Ring of Scale and the Claws of Veeshan being <br>involved, more noteably...Trakanon, Lord Nagafen, and Lady Vox. All of which <br>are outcast from the ring of scale. All of the information of such is posted <br>at <a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net">http://www.1fol.cjb.net</a> upon the war thread. <br><br>With all that said and done from events I have seen, I wholeheartedly believe <br>there will be war soon. As such I would like to begin to prepare setting up <br>active patrols and such. This would mean all the guilds would need to bind <br>together. So I ask all guild leaders that would lend arms, please come to the <br>meeting this saturday the 18th at 4pm est time. We shall meet in West Karanas <br>against the westernmost wall across from the guard tower. <br><br>if we can come to agreement and stand together as one accord I believe <br>strongly nothing can defeat us and a great travesty of dark tidings may <br>indeed fail to come to pass. This should be a great day when an Inner War <br>Council may be forged and as such, when the throes of battle are over and the <br>skies fill with the smoke of the burning pyres of the fallen...it shall be in <br>victory and a day forever where many stood together against a common enemy. A <br>day forever to be remembered in history... <br><br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>Marshall of the Light Armies </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Some of the <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2709511,00.html">first screenshots and a preview of The Shadows of Luclin</a> were published today on GameSpot.  The following excerpt is a clip from the interview portion of the article with Verant's Jeff Butler:<UL><b>GS: In general, what's new in Shadows of Luclin? Verant has stated before that if it were to make another expansion pack after Scars of Velious, it would be more along the lines of the first expansion, Ruins of Kunark, in that it would have an all-new playable race and other low-level features. As such, is Shadows of Luclin designed primarily for new players? </b><br><br>JB: Luclin will include a new player-character race (Kerran), class (Beastlord), and starting city, along with all-new player-character models and textures, DirectX 8 support including hardware T&L, and at least 25 new adventure zones. It is designed for players of all levels. </UL>The Shadows of Luclin is the 3rd EverQuest expansion announced today.

The big part of Alan's visit the the Developer Corner today was the publication of several player's comments on the "What Makes a Zone Interesting?" topic.  Here's the latest:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000103.html"><b>What Makes a Zone Interesting?</b></a><br>We've received so many comments on this topic that I'm not going to even try to respond to all the ones that I'm going to post here. I'll just start it off with a thank you for the responses and end with in a comment. You're all tired of hearing me chatter by now anyway&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well...my favorite zone in the game (so far) is the Crypt of Dalnir. I've only been so far into it, but the theme is coherent. The zone itself tells a story. I love the hyper-intelligent slimes who are controlling the other races in the zone. The mobs are, for the most part, pretty much stuff you can see in a zillion other zones, but they are tied together in a way that is easy to read as you travel and fight in the zone, even if you haven't heard the story from some elf halfway across the world. I really like that. I'm also fascinated by Najena, and would like to know more about her and the fallen temple she inhabits. I'd also like to see more about the Moltor family, whose crypt is Unrest. Paineel is my favorite city. It's beautiful. It has a look that very much matches its inhabitants. It has little things that make it interesting (like the skeletal musicians in the bar). <br><br>Ghuz Spineshank of the Mystic Alliance<br>25 Warrior on Rodcet Nife<br>Rob <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>RaanVenturis wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Two of my favorite zones in the game are Lower Guk and Sebilis (even though I have not yet seen all of sebilis as I am not yet high enuf -only 53). So, when thinking about what I like about zones, I have to consider what I like about those zones. <br><br>First, those zones REQUIRE a well organized and varied group in order to survive. You have to have your healer, your buffer, your snarer, your tanks, corwd control, etc. <br><br>Second, there are only two REQUIRED classes for those zones (cle and enc). All other members of a successful can be varied. <br><br>Third, even with a well balanced and organized group, you are not guanteed success. Both zones still requires playing well together and everyone doing their job to succeed. That makes it a continuous challenge. <br><br>Fourth, both zones DON'T require more than a full group to be successful (except the lowest reaches of sebilis). <br><br>Fifth, there are enough "room areas" that multiple people can play successfully in the zone. <br><br>Sixth nice and varied graphics with a common "theme". <br><br>To sum it all up, the thing that makes a zone great is a that it is a challenge for a full group, has decent loot, does not take so many people to be successful that there is more time spent organizing than fighting, and requires a balanced, varied, and organized group to be successful. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>Nimbul wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think my favorite zone so far, Tower of Frozen Shadows. <br><br>Crowding: hardly any. Most of the time it's a group to a floor <br><br>Location: not hard to get to, right near a port. See crowding, zone in, if it's crowded, leave. It's great. <br><br>Keys: well done! Adds just enough risk to keep lazy players out, but they don't become a hassle. We worked to get a complete backup set, and carefully chose who in the group got keys. (though the spawn rate of the angry librarian needs to be looked at in my opinion, that key is WAY too hard to get compared to the others). <br><br>Phat L3wt: not so much as to draw farmers. Enough to make it exciting when you find something. <br><br>Loot: cash is decent as are weapon drops (for cash) <br><br>Difficulty: just right. If you're smart, risk is minimal. Few roamers for adds means you can do this without the "required" enchanter. You can also do it without a full group. <br><br>Trainless: (is that a word?) the keyed levels eliminate trains. You can only zone out, or to the next (harder) level (and supposedly mobs follow), so there's no place to train to and kill others, or worst, have others train onto you. <br><br>Variety: each new level has a new look/feel, yet still stays within the theme. <br><br>I'd love to see more zones like this. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>OccamsRazor wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I like the little mini-dungeons in the Kunark zones, such as, the small spider cave in Field of Bone, the goblin tunnels in Lake of Ill Omen, the Burynai mines in Frontier Mountains, the Yeti caves in Dreadlands, etc. These aren't full dungeons, but they're more than just tents with a few monsters standing around a campfire. I was impressed and delighted when I found them, and it made me feel rewarded for exploration for the first time in a long time in EQ. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: For me what makes a zone is the ability to move around as you fight. Most zones are overcrowded all the time so you can't do this but certain zones are empty enough that once in a while you can take a group of six and adventure through a zone, instead of killing the same respawning mobs over and over. Sebilis is a great designed zone because it has several part of it that are like independent dungeons. For example you can go to the grup, pick area and most of the time be by yourself with one full group. That part of the zone is big enough so you can move around a bit rather then just pulling non stop. The crypt, and bar/chef area is the same way. For me sebilis marked the evolution of the games dungeons because of this. <br><br>Nurok <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hrm, the Subject thingie is broken again it seems. <br><br>Well, Hi there. <br><br>I wanna comment on this by an example. My favourite zone when it comes to design is Blackburrow (nope, not because I like trains, not really). I like it because it's completely asymmetric, no straight lines anywhere, the guy who created it really did some great work there. It's all messy, you run down first, then over some bridges, you have to dive somewhere, then you go a bit up again to move further inside, climb some ladders, etc. Just like one would expect a real gnoll-hole. When I went in there for the first time, I was really lost, and thats how it's supposed to be. If I would crawl in some newly discovered cave in real life, I would probably get lost the same way. <br><br>However, it's made in such a way that you can recognize some spots (like the brewing barrels, or the bridges) so you can learn your way around once you've been in there for awhile. Thats the one thing about Crystal Caverns I didn't like, there aren't enough of those memorizable spots in there, so it's hard to remember the way upwards through the orc section. Apart from that it's a beautiful zone too, with lovely textures and the singing velium in every corner. Yes, sound effects add alot to atmosphere in a zone too. Drip. Drip. Drip...<br> <br>Also I enjoyed some of the funny creatures you did, e.g. snow bunnys in a 30+ Zone :)  Or a snow dervish slowing down in its rotation and finally falling apart when slain, or the geonids et al. <br>And I laughed my ass off when I was in that school room in Thurgadin where one kid pinches the other and the teacher tells the one who was pinched to stand in the corner, because he yelled out loud :)  Or the sleepy Guard in Icewell. <br><br>(Bah, Absor never posts my comments anyways.) <br><br>/bonk Absor <br><br>Hmm, too many chars to put them all in a signature. You may refer to me as Menemtahe for the moment :-) <br><br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Wow...I could probably write a book about this topic. Here are some short thoughts : <br><br>Speaking from the graphical design of a dungeon, I especially like dungeons that tell a story. The Hole is a very good example. If you are down there you can imagine how it mustve been when the elementals from the plane of underfoot conquered the city and destroyed everything, forcing the heretics to retreat to Paineel. Its creepy to walkk down streets in a ghost town....you see shops and inns, destroyed and with broken furniture. <br><br>As for the gameplay side of design: I think its vey important to have a safe zone in in a dungeon. Not everyone can assemble a party before going to a dungeon. And its hard to form pickup groups if you cant hang around an entrance of a dungeon because of mobs spawning there (Howling Stones). From the entrance it should be possible to go in several directions..not just one way...that would allow for multiple groups to go down without stepping on other people toes. When you go down a path..make it possible to branch off to set up camps in certain areas..so that folloing groups dont have to go through your camp to reach another spot. As for mobs: I know it is a an old topic. But please make it possible to go down without having to have a chanter in the group. Too many mobs in an area and too many roamers together with bad pathing makes a chanter a MUST in a group. Perhaps make the mobs harder but not that many in one spot. Make rooms with just one or two mobs in it. Make a mob that is very hard (doable by one group of course) and that procs pets to make things interesting for example. <br><br>Well, as I said..I could probably write more about it..but I am sure you have a lot of other emails to read...thanks for listening. <br><br>Thoril Honorblade <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>Lantir_DelArmgo wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I, personally, love the feel of Thurgadin. Almost all of the other cities in EverQuest feel barren. Walk into a tavern in Felwithe or Kaladim and what do you see? Not a whole lot. There aren't many npcs in the bar. The pubs in Thurgadin, however, are full of people, and the added sound effects of lots of people talking help bring this area to life. Crowded barrooms are just one of the little touches that make this zone more interesting than others. <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>Goladus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Scenery, atmosphere. I love the remote and desolate feeling of Permafrost, the sinister atmosphere in qeynos catacombs, and the big lava pits in Sol B. Dalnir is freakish and unnerving. To me blackburrow feels like an infestation, though I'd not rate blackburrow as one of the more scenic zones in the game. <br><br>I like when a zone has a good story behind it. <br><br>I like a zone that I can explore solo(meaning the creatures are low level or not agro). <br><br>Or I like a dungeon that a significant portion of can be explored by a single group. <br><br>I like when NPC's respond to hails!<br>I like when NPC's respond to hails! <br><br>***]</i></font> <br><br>We received over 300 comments about what you all like about zones so far. The majority seem to like a theme, a story, a sense of life and mood. Personally, I think that's a key to making the world more enjoyable. Loot is only exciting the first time you see it. A well designed, well plotted, nicely populated zone will be nice every time you see it. <br><br>I just can't post all 300+ messages. But the team has access to all of them. And I'd like to see many more messages for them to read over and use when thinking about zone design. Keep sending in your ideas. I'll post more of your comments later. <br><br>Thanks.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000106.html"><b>Shadows of Luclin</b></a><br>No, I really don't have anything more to tell you about this yet, sorry.

And we also urge you to read the patch message below about the changes to this creature.<br><br><br>Also since we're patching to fix bugs, we decided to throw in a new feature.<br><br>- %M used in a macro will now place the name of your pet (if you have one) in the text of your macro.<br><br>- Bag Positioning:  Now bags will stay where you put them.  Simply open a bag and move it to where you want it.  The bag will remember it's location and open up there again next time.  This will be persistent and will be remembered when you log out.<br><br>There are two things to know about this new feature.  The first is that the default position of every bag is going to be the same.  So if you open one bag and then another, their windows will stack on top of each other.  Don't let this alarm you, the first bag window didn't close.  Just move the top bag to the desired location and you'll see the bottom one.<br><br>The other thing to know is a bit more complicated.<br><br>The saved locations for opening bags are linked to the bank or inventory slot that the bag is in, not to the bag itself.  So if you open a bag that is sitting in your first inventory slot and move the bag window to a new location, it is the inventory slot that remembers the position and any bag opened from that inventory slot will open in the saved position.  Take that bag from the first slot and move it to the second inventory slot and it will open in the location set for the second inventory slot.  It will not remember where it was opened before.<br><br>Experiment with it, it will make more sense once you try it.<br><br><br><br>April 17th, 1:00 pm<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Cosmic Rift Enters Beta Testing  **<br> <br>Sony Online Entertainment's latest massively multiplayer game Cosmic Rift enters open beta testing today, April 17. Cosmic rift is a multiplayer space action game where you take command of a star fighter and wage war with hundreds of other players. To take part in the beta testing, visit the Cosmic Rift web page (at <a href="http://cosmicrift.station.sony.com/">http://cosmicrift.station.sony.com/</a>) to get started.<br><br><br><br>*** Patch Message Addendum ***<br><br>Just a few notes to clear up some questions and some errors in the patch message.<br><br>** Food Changes **<br><br>Along with the other changes mentioned in the patch message, some player-made food items will now have an effect on your character beyond just keeping him from being hungry.  We'll leave it up to you to discover the rest.<br><br>We've also added the ability to right-click food to 'force' your character to eat it.  This will cause the food to be eaten immediately (though your character can only eat so much food at one time).  Food eaten this way will only last half as long as food eaten naturally by the character.<br><br>** Run the Velious Patch **<br><br>If you want to see the new Monk textures you will need to make the changes mentioned in the patch message.  But you will also need to run the Velious Patch in order to get those textures to show up.<br><br>** Skewer Change **<br><br>We didn't actually change the weight of Skewers, we changed the weight of Spits.  Sorry for the confusion.</UL>

Patch Day proved, as usual, to be a very active day for Alan on the Dev Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000104.html"><b>Patch Message</b></a><br>I wanted to post the patch message here and make a few comments about it. <br><br>First of all, this might be the longest patch message I've ever seen. And there's no padding in it. :)<br><br>Mostly I wanted to thank all of you that have sent in suggestions and comments. Many of the things that went into this patch were the direct result of your input. The items that are addressed with this patch encourages me. I'm pretty sure that this new system works well. The team has direct access to your comments and they are able to make changes based on your suggestions without having to weed through a lot of miscellaneous data.<br>--<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000105.html"><b>The Dieties</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I loved seeing this section updated but have one question.Where is Tholuxe Paels.All i know of this one is it is the god of lust (least that was what the message said in the early days of the server)nothing more is known as far as i know of this lesser deity. <br>Teudar 55 enchanter TP<br>Carle 46 warrior BB ]</i></font><br><br>I was going to make mention of the new deities page. I'm glad you brought it up. <br><br>Yes, there are a few gods missing from the list (and Drinal, who isn't a god at all.) We'll update them when we get a more in-depth description from the designers. But for now, the list is a lot more complete. I'll try to let you know when we update it in the future.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000075.html"><b>Forging Issues</b></a><br>Lybernia wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm not convinced that this is working as intended. I was naked after a death and left without food and water of course. I was recieving the message that I was out of food and drink. I foraged and got food, I foraged 3 more times and got food as well. At this point I was only recieving the message about drink. I never sucesfully foraged water before getting back to my corpse and my belongings. ]</i></font><br><br>Ok, I'm getting a lot of e-mails like this. I guess I wasn't clear enough when I explained this, so I'll try again. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If, and only if, you are receiving "You are hungry" messages (not if you are out of food, only if you are receiving this message) AND you successfully forage, you will automatically forage food. <br><br>If, and only if, you are receiving "You are thirsty" messages (not if you are out of water, only if you are receiving this message) AND you successfully forage, you will automatically forage water. ]</i></font><br><br>Being out of food or water is not going to guarantee that you will forage food or water. <br><br>And you are not guaranteed to succeed at your foraging if you are receiving the 'hungry' or 'thirsty' messages. Your chance to succeed does not increase at all. <br><br>For most people in most situations, the run to retrieve your corpse will not be long enough for you to start getting the hungry and thirsty messages.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Topic of Religon</b></a><br>Yegolev wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I guess this is a general discussion of religion now, so my comment is this: <br><br>I play on The Nameless server. I'm interested in creating a PC that worships The Nameless. I realize that the modern-day races probably have no inkling of The Nameless as an entity, but I want to run around chanting "Down with Veeshan", "Karana is a Poser" and "Tunare Go Home". <br><br>No chance? ]</i></font><br><br>Yup, no chance. :)<br><br>You're correct in your evaluation (as far as I know) that most residents of Norrath probably wouldn't know who the Nameless was. <br><br>But you could, therefore, play an agnostic character who claims to worship this god that nobody has heard of. You would be considered an agnostic by people simply because they think you worship a figment of your imagination or a myth. <br><br>So there is a chance after all&#8230; <br><br>Muktuk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As for Veeshan-worshipping bards and threatening faction: I've always thought worshipping dragonkind must be something like worshipping Cthulu--you've been devoted and faithful, sure, but you're still getting eaten eventually... ]</i></font><br><br>/em laughs. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: (quote)<br>Here's another idea, one that kinda ties in to changing dieties, but dosen't have to. There are imbued items, that are diety specific; why not spells (not just the imbue spells) that are diety specific? Maybe wizards worshipping Solusek Ro would get better fire DD spells, for example. <br><br>Astroshak<br>(/quote) <br><br>I saw the above in the Agnostic Iksar thread, and it sorta jived with something I randomly thought of this morning on the way to work. Instead of new spells, would it be possible to adjust the power of existing spell types based on religion? For example, a wizard who worships Solusek Ro (using the previous example) could have a bonus to fire based spells. Perhaps a wizard who worships Karana could have a bonus to rain spells. Prexus wizards could have bonuses to Ice spells, and I'm certain you could perhaps tie another deity to magic/lightning based spells, and maybe another to AoE spells. Note of course that I'm not certain of what deities Wizards can worship, so the examples might not be entirely valid. <br><br>And you wouldn't necessarily have to make it across all levels, either, you could have the bonus only kick in after a certain level (as a Wizard grows in his/her spirituality or something) and even have a quest that might activate the power. If you can't tie the ability directly to just religion, you could just make deity specific items that boost each element or spell type's power, much like the focus items for necros and magicians, and make them questable, something to prove the wizard's devotion to their god. And by making the quests tough enough, and use combinable containers, you could perhaps prevent the quest from being completed before the wizard hits a certain level (approximately, at least). <br><br>Such a focus type ability and/or item could help wizards' complaints about mana efficiency, and also help bring to the foreground the nature of their deity and the roleplaying aspects of such. It could be a great way to inject more story and more personality to some deities. <br><br>Tenbil En`Haldar ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, that's possible. But, actually, something like that would probably be harder to balance, as it affects a large portion of the characters abilities rather than just making new spells that can more easily be balanced. <br><br>And when we're talking about adding spells or abilities for casters that are deity specific (and I noted that you broadened it to int casters, when my first thought was just wis casters), you have to think of Rogues that worship Brell, and Warriors that worship Cazic and any and all other combinations. Sure, after looking at all the combinations you might decide to restrict to just Wis casters at the end, but you have to go through all those other possibilities. <br><br>I rather like the idea, personally. But the amount of work that would have to be done and the potential for making some sort of error would be huge and would certainly make me hesitant to do it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000048.html"><b>Continued Discussion on Population/Server Issues</b></a><br>Crim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, I've been following your responses on the topic of item decay and want to point out one aspect about it. <br><br>You point out, correctly in my opinion, that item decay in EQ as it currently stands would be a disaster because of the tedium involved. But, the major tedium factor for item decay is due to EQ's overemphasis on making items rare. I have played games where item decay worked and worked quite well. <br><br>Simply put, item decay works in an environment that places less emphasis on the rarity of items. I'm not talking about adjusting the risk/reward of encounters. Instead, I'm talking about increasing the availability of items such that it isn't tedious to obtain new items as your old ones decay. <br><br>Not only would you essentially destroy the vast ebay market for items but you would encourage player transactions because of the increase in items and need for items. You would also discourage the twinking problem because of the need for items at appropriate levels. <br><br>For example, imagine the ghoul lord dropped an SSB and a ykesha every time he spawned (and he spawned every time). But, ykeshas and SSBs decayed after a certain amount of time (or dropped to a lower effectiveness etc.). Basically then not only would the dungeon crawling experience be better (i.e. placeholders are a hack way of limiting item availability and ruin a good dungeon crawl) but there would be an active market for those classes who would use ykeshas. <br><br>Anyway, I've rambles on long enough but I hope I have gotten my point across. If you take away the tedium in replacing decayed/destroyed items, then you can make a workable (and in fact better) system involving items. ]</i></font><br><br>I understand your point. But I think maybe you're missing something. <br><br>If ykeshas, for example, were to decay (becoming less effective) and at the same time more available to compensate, this wouldn't be as good of a thing as it might seem. <br><br>You would spend as much time, if not more, camping to get your ykesha. You would be heading back to the same place to get a new one at levels beyond the point where getting the item is a challenge. Some people do that now, but everyone would have to do it if their ykesha was wearing out and they needed a new one. You'd be seeing more high level people working lower level dungeons. A lot of people don't want to spend their time re-acquiring and item in a place that they've already seen enough of when they were at the right level to be challenged by it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Chadrack's ideas would have profound(not necesarily bad) effects on item-loot pvp. <br><br>-Goladus ]</i></font><br><br>Very good point. I'll have to think about the repercussions on PvP. But it's obvious that the ability to turn things No-Drop would have a tremendous effect on PvP where looting items is possible. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan,<br>Thank you for your concern about this issue.<br>- Doesn't the idea of monsters being "camped" around the clock offend you? This is a game of questing, and I can see making people have to do long, involved quests, involving travel, fighting, and almost anything else. But the idea of just sitting, waiting for a quest monster to appear, bothers me. ]</i></font><br><br>Offend me? No. Bother me? Yes. But, and I know you've heard me say this before, nobody is forced to sit around and wait for an NPC to spawn. You may have to do that if you want the item that everyone tells you is important, but no item is required for any character. If you don't want to sit and wait for an NPC, go do something else. <br><br>Yes, the fact that people sit and wait around for NPCs to spawn does bother me. But it doesn't offend me. I don't do it, so how could it offend me? :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - I think that making all items NODROP is, as you said, not feasable. Making a lot more, not all, items NODROP/LORE may be a good thing. The player I am thinking of here is one like myself, up and coming, untwinked, looking to discover the world you have created. Making that person contend with an upper-level power player or guild who is camping what, to me, is a unique, special quest item, is troublesome.]</i></font> <br><br>Making more items No-Drop would not necessarily reduce the desire for those items. It just means that people that are now 'farming' them for their alternate characters would have to be more creative to get the items. And they are such an artificial thing, so contrary to the reality of Norrath (why is it that I can't give away this Kobold Molar? It's just a tooth.) that I hesitate to ever suggest making more of them. Personally, I'd love to be able to remove them. I'd love to think that everyone would go get their own when the time came, rather than farming items for people that aren't high enough level to earn the item. But that's not a reality. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - I believe your loot rules in the Warrens are trying to address these issues, and thank you for that. Have you considered simply placing level floors and ceilings on items? ]</i></font><br><br>Sure, we've considered it. But that's no more 'realistic' than No-Drop items, and has the same drawbacks. People would still 'farm' the items, they would just hold them until their characters were high enough level to use them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: - How about limiting members to one character per server? ]</i></font><br><br>That's something that we've talked about on a server with new rules. We're certainly not going to force people to delete characters off of existing servers. But there are all kinds of arguments for and against this idea. I love to play a lot of characters, and I have one for every mood. I'd be restricted to just one mood on each server. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Thank you,<br>Manus<br>Vallon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>Thank you.</UL>

A large new message was added to the Patch Server this morning:<UL>April 17th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br>** Food Changes **<br><br>- Food items now have a 'duration'.  This means that some food items will not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will sustain your character longer than they did before.<br><br><br>** Bug Fixes **<br><br>- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat.  This fellow has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to.  We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to work with this patch.<br><br>- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a character was healed or damaged by spells.  This could be seen, for example, when a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up and then quickly go back down a bit right afterwards.  There was no error in the assignment of healing or damage previously, just in the way it was being displayed.<br><br>- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different bracer graphic than you would.  Now everyone (including the wearer) will always see the same bracer texture.  If you have two bracers that have a different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right wrist inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose to show for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, which will show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will go back to showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).<br><br>- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead to accidentally zoning back the way they had come.  You should be facing the right way when you make that zone transition now.<br><br><br>** Zone and Quest Changes **<br><br>- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. This should make at least one quest more available.<br><br>- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens.  Hopefully this will allow Troll bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items.  Previously, if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the merchant would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all four at once to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy.  Now he will have 4 in either case.<br><br>- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains.  Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests.  Hopefully these changes will dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.<br><br>- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  This is the beginning of our overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious.<br><br><br>** Improved and New Features **<br><br>- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all of your corpses.<br><br>- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, etc...) from merchants.  It works the same way as sell in that you can hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item.<br><br>- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with /wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is).  You can now use /wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each window separately.<br><br>- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them.  This will work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 'auto-equip' area of your character profile.  So if there is already a piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room for it.<br><br>- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target when the chat bar is up.  When the chat bar is open the tab key will take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply names.  When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between yourself and your last target.<br><br>- /assist has an added parameter.  /assist on and /assist off will determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use /assist.  So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using /assist will NOT engage your character's auto-attack.  This change will be persistent, so it will remain as you left it when you log out.  /assist also now has a range of 200 feet.<br><br>- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying coins.  This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting the wrong item.  PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to be certain that you are destroying the right item before choosing to destroy it.<br><br>- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than just 'hail'.<br><br>- Added /charinfo command.  Currently this command only reports the zone where the current character is bound.  We may add further information as things progress.<br><br>- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported).<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the two one-handed weapons.  What will happen now is rather simple.  The very next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it.<br><br>THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than in your inventory.  So once you have combined them, make sure to place them in your inventory.  And don't panic, the items didn't disappear.  :)  But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and needs to be able to fit into your main inventory).  If you end up with a No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your inventory, you will have a problem...<br><br>Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged.  Right now you won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it is created.  We're working on fixing that bug.  We decided to make this change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the problems with the old scabbard.<br><br>This new scabbard will have a special ability.  It will be able to recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them.  Simply place a Sword of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine button.  The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of Runes into the permanent epic sword.<br><br>Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new ones.  That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the quest and combined the swords for the first time.<br><br>- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, it's a big two-handed axe...).  If you have one in a bag now, be aware that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it out.<br><br>- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your character inventory upon disconnection with the server.  If you are disconnected from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent items (such as summoned food and water) will remain on your character as long as you log back to that character within 30 minutes.  After thirty minutes those No Rent items will be deleted.  There may be some extreme cases beyond our control (such as hardware failures) where No Rent items will not be on your character even if you log back in within the 30 minute timeframe.  No reimbursement will be given for No Rent items lost in this manner.<br><br>- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the "Pouch of Quellios" as intended.  If you have one of these items and it still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them to switch yours for a new one.<br><br>- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.<br><br>- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly.<br><br>- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced.<br><br>- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3.<br><br>- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed.  If you're wearing these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd announce it anyway.  New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth dropped armors and on the questable armors.  Because the Velious textures can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new armors will not be loaded by default by the game.  If you want to see the new textures you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE.<br><br><br>** Trade Skill Changes **<br><br>- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry made for their god.  For those that not only sing around the campfire, but sing about the campfire!<br><br>- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed.  Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear.  But if the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still in it.  Those items should no longer seem to disappear.<br><br>- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel Chestplate has been increased a little.<br> <br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making cultural armor.<br><br>Enchant Velium<br>Enchant Mithril<br>Enchant Adamantite<br>Enchant Steel<br>Enchant Brellium<br><br>- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from Lapis Lazuli to Malachite.  They now use the same reagent as every other Magician pet spell.<br><br>Minor Summoning: Earth <br>Minor Summoning: Water <br>Minor Summoning: Fire<br>Minor Summoning: Air<br>Elemental: Earth<br>Elemental: Water<br>Elemental: Fire<br>Elemental: Air<br><br><br>- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets will now appear upon a successful use of the spell):<br><br>Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)<br>Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)<br>Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)<br>Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle)<br><br>- Cannibalize IV now exists.  This spell is now available in Velious.<br><br>- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved.

From PlanetEverQuest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Warriors</a>.  What do you know about them?  Warriors are the ultimate tanks and because so many races allow them, they come in a vast array of sizes and colors. Strength is one of their primary stats and because of their bulging muscles and extensive training they can wield most any weapon with the skill and cunning of a seasoned adventurer. But there's so much more to this class .. how much do you really know about these blademasters of Norrath?</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Alan spoke on the subject of /report on the Dev Corner today.  Here is his <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000100.html">complete post</a>:<UL>I wanted to give you all a brief explanation about how to use /report.<br><br>When you have a problem in game where there is text describing the problem in your chat window, /report allows you to send that information to us. This information comes directly off the server and is stored to a database here, so there is no concern about anyone using /report to cheat. This is the most reliable way to get your information to us.<br><br>The most common example for using this feature is when someone is harassing you. Use /report to send us the offensive text and then send in a /petition with full details of the incident (include the fact that you've used /report as well, so the GMs know that it's there).<br><br>/report will only send us the text that is currently visible in your chat window. So make certain that the text you want us to see is visible when you use /report. Scroll up until you have what you need in the chat window.<br><br>Also, the syntax for /report is /report <name>. The <name> is the name of the person you are reporting about. If someone is harassing you, use their name. But if you are reporting something that happened to you, such as a bug that made you fall for 10,000 points of damage, then put your character's name after /report.<br><br>Nothing else is needed with /report. Please don't type /report <name> and then a lot of text explaining your concern. Use /petition to explain the concern.<br><br>Correct use of the /report feature can make it much easier for us to get things straightened out when there is a problem. <br><br>Alan</i></UL>
