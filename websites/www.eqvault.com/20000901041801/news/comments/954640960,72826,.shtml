<br>

<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Good grief has Gordon been busy today.  In the past 24 hours Mr. Wrinn has made over 60 posts on the Gameplay board alone.  Here's a rundown of some of his latest:<UL><b>Quest Structure</b><br>We're not at all opposed to quests giving out real (e.g. tangible) experience, however that's really not going to be possible given the current architecture. The problem is that we need to have the ability to store completion-info as part of the character. This would keep the same character from doing the same quest over and over again, which is what keeps us from doing things like giving out half-a-level for a tough quest. Tracking this unfortunately isn't possible without doing a player-wipe. The Quest engine could be improved in many other ways, but they all require the ability to know exactly what a character has or has not done. <P><b>Hybrid Debate</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/028515.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Wow! These are probably some of the best arguments I've seen. I am impressed...however... <P>Hybrids don't get teleports, not even Gate. Only two classes get teleports, and even though rangers are a hybrid of one of those classes, there's really no compelling reason to make an exception.<P><b>Money and the PoS</b><br>If you are paying 3Kpp per person to go to the Plane of Sky, there's only one reason: You want to. The zone need not cost a cent after the first trip in. Deaths can be handled with resurrect. Heck, you can even get by a few of the key requirements using death, resurrect, and summon-corpse (this one costs money though). <P>Now of course if you want to bring more people than there are keys, or skip by the first island, it's going to cost you. We want the Plane of Sky to remain challenging regardless of how many warm bodies you can throw at it.<P><b>Skill Caps and Individuality</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: What about giving characters one generic skillcap point per level that they could assign to any skill? Or&#8230; implement some quests that can raise skillcaps for different skills.  A 50th level character could have assigned 50 skillcap points to one skill raising its effectiveness by 10 levels. If this is too much there could be a skillcap addition cap for certain skills.]</i><P>First, just because you stop gaining in a particular skill doesn't mean that your skill level does not go up. For instance, a level 50 person with a 200 skill in 1HS does not hit like a level 40 person, they hit like a level 50 person because their is more to calculating it than just the skill. <P>Secondly, please keep in mind that all of this stuff is balanced based upon the caps and how they work now. We just can't arbitrarily decide to start letting people increase their skill-caps on a whim. Sure, it would be neat, but since things are currently balanced, the only way that something like this could go in is if we substantially nerfed the skills so that any net gain would be zero. <P>Finally, enabling what you ask for here would not diverse characters. Skill-based systems never do. Everyone gravitates towards having whatever skills are perceived to be ideal. This has been persistent flaw in every skill-based MMORPG architecture that has been developed. That&#8217;s why we chose to go with a class-based system.<P><b>Drops in PoH</b><br>Just trying to verify your logic: The drop percentages in Hate are low so people with armor in Hate will play longer? I suppose that means that since the drops in Fear are higher, we must want everyone with armor there to quit. <P>Please... We have Hate updated on the Test server and hope to patch it live the next time we do data. Probably next week.<P><b>Bonus Skill Points</b><br>Well I can say that we don't have any intention of including bonus points. It's certainly possible for people to work up any skills that they need, the inclusion of more points would just serve to save them some time, and go a long way towards making point meaningless in the first place. Save them up!<P><b>Kunark and International Orders</b><br>Our plan is to have the Expansion in everyone's hands prior to the official launch, even the overseas people. That's our plan, and it is looking good so far. However we really won't be able to nail it down further for a bit yet.<P><b></b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029398.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Unfortunately, this is the way resurrection works, and it's not considered a bug. If the resurrection doesn't go through on the first time for whatever reason (e.g. Zone, cancel, LD, etc.), the experience cannot be restored. <br><i>[Quote from original post: I disagree with the behavior not being considered a bug. A res should give the exp, period. No, two reses should NOT give any more exp than one res.]</i><P> I understand your opinion, however when making coding decisions, the programmers have to decide how many contingencies they are willing to trap. There are functions that you can perform in the game that account for all different kinds of things that can go wrong, such as everything that can go wrong in a trade. <P>Resurrection is one of those things where not everything possible is trapped. It makes resurrection fairly black-and-white, but has the side-effect of missing them under certain circumstances. <P><b>Resurrection Bug</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: I too recently lost the exp from missing the first res attempt. What happened was, I was waiting a while on the cleric to med and res, and going through inventory. The window popped up as I clicked on an inventory item - and clicking on the item made the res window disappear!!]</i><P> Yeah, I'll buy that that is a bug with the confirmation-box code. You would think that a confirmation box wouldn't disappear unless you actually click on something. In *most* cases, it's safe to assume the answer is "NO", which is how the item-destroy confirmation works, but I can see this being a problem in reference to a resurrect. I'm not sure if this can be worked around, but I'll bring it to the Team.<P><b>Fear and Charm in PvP</b><br>Fear and Charm spells have been disabled in the PvP environment for some time due to abuses that surround them. They made it possible for all kinds of bad things to happen, including intentionally causing experience loss and they allowed people to bypass the PvP level limits. <P>When this was done, AE Fear spells continued to work due to how those spells interact with the players. This latest patch merely fixed that issue, causing PCs to be immune to them as well as the single target spells from before.<P><b>On Reported Bard Bug</b><br>GZ has vowed to take another look at it, though no progress has been made. He's fairly tied up with trying to get the expansion spells in order. Due to the complexity of the spell system, we prefer to have only one person with the ability to modify spells.<P><b>Terms and Phrases</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Just time for another "pop" word I think...."Uber-guild" is dead....both the word and the definition.]</i><P>Hmmm... <br><br>Overguild<br>Superguild<br>Surguild<br>Pas Sous Guild<br>Powerguild<br>Capo-guild<br>Bossguild<br>|3W|_guild<br>Getsmolewtguild<br> <br>Hmmm... Maybe we should just stick with Uberguild<P><b>Pro Asheron's Call Posts on the Official Boards</b><br>We really don't mind seeing the posts on the board proclaiming one game better than another. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that opinion means so much more when it is tested. It's one thing for us to talk about the positive aspects of EQ when people haven't tried another game. It's another thing when they've tried the other games and then affirmatively choose EQ. <P>Thank you for continuing to choose EQ.<P><b>Magician Spells</b><br>Breaking a moment from not speaking about 50+ spells, I'd like to say that magicians will keep Malosi, it just won't be as a level 49 spell. <P><b>DoT Spells</b><br>There's a difference between having one message that's sent to one person, and having one message that's broadcast to several. For things like Taunt and Spell damage, it would result in an increase of network traffic that would be problematic :(<P><b>Do Celebirties Play EQ?</b><br>I've wondered this many times myself. I'd heard that a mainstream band interviewed in a popular music rag once stated that they spent their spare time playing EQ. I'm sure there are other celeb's playing, and wouldn't mind knowing for personal reasons. They can feel free to email me at gwrinn@verant.com if they like, and I'll even see about getting a signed poster out :)<P><b>Charm Bug</b> (<a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/029409.html">Click here</a> for original post)<br>Indeed a bug, and easy to understand when you know how this stuff works. I'll forward it to the test team.<P><b>More on DoTs</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: When it breaks fear tho the mob runs for me at full normal speed, as for some weird reason whenever fear is broken or wears off, the movement inhibiting portion of the "darkness" line of dots seems to wear off as well.]</i><P> This definitely isn't as designed, nor is it as I've observed myself. I'd suggest you try some extensive testing to see if it&#8217;s truly the case. If this did go in at some time it was accidental. Can anyone confirm or deny this behavior?<P><P><b>What about Pet Bashing in this patch?</b><br>Well it's not just pets, it's all NPCs are refusing to bash without a shield. And yes, that will be corrected in this patch.<P><b>Can EQ Be Made Into a Better game?</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: At this point in development, with EQ having been out for a year and over 200,000 installed copies of it on the market Verant would be making a bad business choice to rework every system that we, as players, recommend to them to be changed.]</i><P> That's something that we struggle with here on a near-daily basis, and it comes up every time we discuss any planned enhancement or "nerf" to any particular aspect of the game: Do the ends justify the means. Will the changes we are considering really do anything for the game? Will it make people stay longer? Will it prompt them to quit sooner? Will the people who will stay longer make up for all the people that will quit instantly because of a specific change? Do we really want to risk making vast sweeping changes to an already successful game? <P>In a system with over 200K active subscribers, we can pretty much bet that any change we make to the game will cause people to quit sooner, stay longer, quit instantly, resubscribe, and do nothing at all. All of these actions are represented. <P>So, to the people who think that we just run around arbitrarily making changes to the game, I'd like to point out that there is a whole lot more to it than that.<P><b>The Odds</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Anyone have the odds that the servers will be down for more then 2 hours.]</i><P>I'll give 3:1 again :)<P><b>Casters realm reports that all of the dot spells now give messages when they wear off - True?</b><br>I can confirm this. I believe that someone suggested it on the boards yesterday, and I said I'd take it to the team. Well the programmer who does things like that regularly reads the board here. He grabbed it and ran with it. <P>The technology that lets us report when charm and fear wears off is what let us do this fairly easily. <P>One additional note that's not mentioned at castersrealm is that pets should now tell their owners when a beneficial spell wears off. <P><b>EverQuest and Realism</b><br>Sometimes we have to put some limitations on realism for the sake of gameplay. This takes many forms, some of which are considered both good and bad. As an example, it's "unrealistic" for someone to heal from near-dead to full simply by sitting on your can for 20 minutes. Even in game-time, that only accounts for about 8 hours. Embracing realism in this case would lead to tedium in the game. <P>The same philosophy is true for things such as archery. Though realistically, a person with a really good bow could kill something in but a few shots, from a gameplay standpoint that would be too powerful. Though tedium isn't an issue with this, the sanctity and meaning of gameplay (e.g. challenge) is at stake. <P><b>GM Events Involving City Assaults</b><br>We'd like to see it too, and have tried it on occasion. Unfortunately it's always followed by people coming to the boards and complaining how we get our kicks out of killing newbies. After about the 3rd or 4th time we decided to reevaluate our plans and try to hold these types of things at least one zones from a newbie zone.<P><b>Posion Update</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: Can us rogues expect to see comments regarding the poison changes?]</i><P>Comments as in "When will they be done?" or comments addressing "What will they consist of?" <P>To the former, we've got it set for post-expansion right now. I posted in another thread about it today: <P>---SNIP---<br><i>[Quote from original post: I don't suppose any rogue changes were put in? </i><P>Nothing in this patch specifically addressed the rogue class. As far as what we have planned, we're still planning an update for poison, but that's looking to be post-expansion now. Doing a worthwhile update for poison is far more difficult than putting in something like Evade or the hide/sneak/undead thing. It will take a good deal of effort to get it right.<br>---SNIP--- <P>As for the latter, we're still working on that. All I can say is that it is supposed to be "cool" :)<P><P><b>Pet Bug Overview</b><br>NPCs (pets included) have always had the ability to bash (slam) without having a shield equipped. The ability was accidently removed in the patch last Friday, and was put back in in the patch today. <P><b>Expansion Skills for Melee</b><br><i>[Quote from original post: What's up with them? Have they already been selected, coded, and finalized (I hope so, release is but a few precious weeks away, but then again... -bah, this isn't a flame, but a qustion) All the casters have their rumored new spells posted on every EQ board from here to Kaladim, but what about the new melee skills?]</i><P> They've been coded and are currently undergoing balance tests on the Test server. We just aren't ready to release any specific information about them. As for the spell info that's out there, there wasn't much we could do about that. We're just not commenting on them either, and have thrown in a few red herrings to keep people guessing.<br>--<br>All of the melee classes are getting new abilities post-50. Though I wouldn't classify them as skills (a skill being something that you must train up, whereas abilities are semi-innate). We do not, however, wish to comment on any specifics in regards to them at this time.<P><b>Harmony and Feign Death</b><br>Harmony and Feign Death cannot be compared directly. The spell and skill have two completely different uses. Harmony, for instance, is an outdoor-only offensive spell, and Feign Death is an escape skill that works everywhere.<P><b>Rogue Changes?</b><br>Nothing in this patch specifically addressed the rogue class. As far as what we have planned, we're still planning an update for poison, but that's looking to be post-expansion now. Doing a worthwhile update for poison is far more difficult than putting in something like Evade or the hide/sneak/undead thing. It will take a good deal of effort to get it right.</UL>
