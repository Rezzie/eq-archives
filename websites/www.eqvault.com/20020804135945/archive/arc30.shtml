But foul language does not need to be directed at you to be warnable or bannable. <br><br>The best way to deal with it is to scroll up until the offensive chat is visible in your chat window, then use /report &lt;character name&gt;, where the character name is the name of one of the offenders (you'll have to pick one, but include all offenders in your petition), then /petition &lt;full details&gt;. <br><br>This gets the offensive text on file and tells the GMs that they need to look it up and come and deal with it. <br><br>Cyrisha wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Not sure about you but your links didn't work for me.

Two more posts to report to you tonight from the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>More Sullon Zek Talk</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I really think a second server should be put out with the Deity rule set. <br><br>I know you're waiting for things to settle down but we're approaching the first week mark and every night so far there has been over 3k people at night and 2k in the mornings. <br><br>Has anyone ever stopped to think that you guys might have came up with something that everyone likes? This is a hit, guys! The only down side is 150-300 people in newbie zones. I don't see this dying down either, or lookie-loos leaving. People actualy want to play this thing. I'm one of them! <br><br>So please, at least consider thinking about starting a second server. <br><br>Surefoot Twelvetoes<br>Sterling Order of Knights<br>Fennin Ro ]</i></font><br><br>It's just too early to think about a new server. We're certainly enthusiastic about the way the rules have been received by the players, but we want to wait before we make any decisions about the future for this server. Let's see if the numbers are still high in a month or two. Remember, this is a rather harsh server to play on, what with experience loss and all that, so let's see how it goes before declaring it a huge success&#8230; <br><br>:)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have a couple of Questions / Issues with the PVP Ruleset on Sullon...<br><br><br>1. Is the entire Cancel Magic Line of Spells considered to be 'beneficial' and not castable on opponents in PVP? This spell line is commonly used (particularly with Pumice) to dispel beneficial buffs / effects from an opponent such as SOW, Levitate or Damage Shields. Now, I can see it could potentially be used to 'crossteam' by canceling harmful spells on a foe, however, does this override the near essential use of this spell line in offensive PVP? Would it be possible to have the spell line only remove beneficial spell effects from a member of a opposing Team when cast on them?<br><br><br>2. The Posted Rules state that Neutrals would con to a Good or Evil Team member as 'apprehensive' rather than threatening as Goods and Evils are supposed to CON to each other. However, in game, conning a member of an opposing Team is the same 'threatening'. Will this be fixed one way or the other, as the conning system does a lot to develop the roleplay mindset in PVP?<br><br><br>3. With the addition of the rogue ability to pickpocket PCs the question arises: Does this follow the level limits of PVP? Can a rogue pickpocket a PC who is not yet PVP enabled (i.e.: 5th or lower)? In game, several rogues have tried to pickpocket my 5th Ranger, all unsuccessful, causing my character to react by calling for Guards. Does the fact my character did react to the pickpocket attempt indicate they could pickpocket from her without her having the ability to use PVP to defend against it? Is this as it is intended to be? <br><br>Thanks for answering these questions. <br><br>-Sazami of Sullon Zek ]</i></font><br><br>1. Cancel Magic spells should work across teams. They function mostly in an offensive capacity. Their use to 'cross team' is very limited. <br><br>2. I thought the apprehensive thing was supposed to be in game myself&#8230; I'll ask around. <br><br>3. Yes, pick pockets is supposed to follow the level limitations of PvP. I can't see why someone should even be able to attempt to pick the pocket of someone under 6th level&#8230; I'll ask about this too.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000231.html"><b>Patch Fixes</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "We fixed the way that NPCs were treating pets. They were accrediting more hate to pets than they should have." <br><br>I still don't think its fixed :)<br><br>Saturday we had a day long raid in Kael, arena area.. during that day our tanks could not get mobs off my pets no matter what they did. Even if I repetedly hit pet back off and the warrior was attacking and taunting like mad, it still hit my pet. <br><br>Now, I agree, before pets were building zero aggro, and this was a problem, but now they are out-aggroing 59th level warriors! (and these are only the 54th level summons (so a 41-45th level pet) <br><br>It seems that the aggro is still out of balance, could you look into it again? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Takiel Vrathe. ]</i></font><br><br>We're still looking at this. It seems that the fix might not have been complete. I certainly noticed that it was much better after the patch, but there may still be a few bugs in it. Keep in mind, though, that there is no promise that we will or even want to return things to exactly the way they were regarding pets. As you say, zero aggro for pets isn't really in the plan either. <br><br>Goladus wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: LOL, I was quite surprised when my saw a mob shout 'You will not evade me Gibober!'

Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on this server to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning this server. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on any server. <br><br>Unfortunately, we have been forced to warn, suspend and banish a relatively high number of players (over 60 suspensions since the server opened) that have chosen to ignore the part of the rule after the bolded word HOWEVER.<br><br>Remember, we will continue to enforce rules about common decency. We will not allow any sort of swearing or out of character racial slurs. We will not allow names that violate our naming policy (<a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp</a>).<br><br>Yes, we expect players on this server to duke it out for their team.

Dynamite sent word of a new event on Fennin Ro:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail my fellow wizards of Fennin Ro!!<br><br>    As you know, in past months, I have hosted a rune trade faire for<br>wizards, that we may help each other further our research and<br>development of spells. Last month I was not able to host the faire on<br>account of my writing my final exams, but this month the faire is on!<br>    <br>As in past months, the idea is simple: wizards of all levels meet<br>together and bring their runes. If you need a rune, ask for it, and if<br>anyone has it, they will give it to you. Conversely, if you have a rune<br>someone else is in need of, that you yourself do not need, then it is<br>expected that you shall give it to them freely. This has been a great<br>success in past months, and I'm looking forward to this month being even<br>better!<br><br>    I have had requests to postpone the faire past this weekend as I am<br>told a number of guilds are having events that would coincide with the<br>faire were it held this weekend (I understand one guild is even having<br>an all-weekend scavenger hunt!), and even though that would mean putting<br>the faire past the end of the month, I see no reason why not to postpone<br>it. As such, the faire will be held at the following place, date, and<br>time:<br><br>Where: Toxxullia Wizard Spires<br>When: Monday July 2nd<br>Starting Time: 3PM PST (6PM EST)<br>Ending Time: When all is said and done, and we have finished having fun!<br><br>    As always, I ask that if you ply a trade in which others may partake<br>of your wares and enjoy them, please feel free to bring some of your<br>fare with you! I myself brew, and always ensure I bring enough of my<br>wares to keep everyone happy. If you would care to bring some of your<br>own stock, or if you bake and would like to share your wares, then by<br>all means, bring them with you! These are always welcome!<br>    <br>While this is a faire geared primarily at wizards, I invite everyone<br>to attend. It's good fun and you can get to know your community better.<br>Since I started hosting this faire, I've gotten to know my fellow<br>wizards much better, and am constantly conversing with them... I like to<br>think that this has helped me gain many friends, and will help to gain<br>many more. For this reason alone, even if you aren't a wizard, or if<br>you're a wizard that cannot yet research, or has no more use of<br>research, you should attend anyway! Especially if you are beyond the<br>point that research can advance you, as you can help your fellow wizards<br>who are not quite as advanced as yourself research their spells. Higher<br>level wizards have always been at hand in the past to help younger<br>wizards research their spells, and there is no reason for this to change<br>now.<br><br>    If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, by all means,<br>either send me a tell in-game, or contact me at fenninrunes@hotmail.com,<br>and I will get back to you as soon as possible.<br><br>    I am using the faire this month as a guage of sorts. I intend to use<br>its success in order to determine how popular the faire really is, and<br>whether it should continue. So the more people that attend, the more<br>likely it is that you'll see another faire! I hope one day to limit the<br>faire not only to wizards, but to all casters to come together and share<br>their research, help each other, and get to know each other in the<br>community.<br><br>    I look forward to seeing you there this Monday, my friends, and I<br>hope this will be the greatest faire yet!!<br><br>Dynamite Shortfuze<br>Fennin Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Fresh off the Developer's Corner is a heap of new bits and pieces of information written by Alan in response to feedback sent in by players like you:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Team Server Feedback</b></a><br>B_O_B wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ----------------<br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br>---------------------- <br><br>I asked this question today, <br><br>"'One part of the rules confused me. When it said you would only lose faction by killing a PC if you killed it in their home town, does that mean, for instance, killing a gnome in Steamfont Mountains? Or Ak`Anon?'" <br><br>and got this answer <br><br>"Raenna tells you, 'Hello Guide Raenna here, we're not sure on that question. I recommend that you post the question to Absor on the Developers Corner'" <br><br>So I did what I was told ;-)]</i></font><br><br>Just Ak'Anon. The rule applies to starting cities (not newbie zones). The exceptions are zones like Freeport that have city zones with bat yards attached (and you would lose faction there) and Greater Faydark, where the whole zone is considered a starting city for elves. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Is there any way that you guys can Start a secound Server for this? I am getting Kinda Tired with 300+ people in faydark. and 180 in BB. Or you going to wait for it to be live for a while? or what? Maybe on the new server Coin+item. or not I don't care.. but a new server i think is needed! <br><br>Thanks Andrew]</i></font> <br><br>All new servers look like that. Give it a while and everything should smooth out.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000228.html"><b>Feedback on the Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: ----<br>Players who are invulnerable won't be the primary on the hate-list for NPC's any longer. <br>---- <br><br>Does this mean warriors will fall off of the hate list when they use DISCIPLINE OF FURIOUS against melee only mobs? <br><br>Discipline Description:<br>When using this discipline the warrior will automatically riposte every attack landed on them by the opponent they are facing. This discipline lasts for 9 seconds and has a base reuse time of 60 minutes. The reuse time for this discipline will decrease as the warrior gains additional levels.<br><br><br>Dractwo Smackdaddy<br>55 Warrior RN ]</i></font><br><br>No. The discipline does not make you invulnerable. It makes you very good at riposting. <br><br>Invulnerability is a very specific thing in EverQuest. You can, as far as I know, only obtain it with a few spells, and all of those spells also make it so that you can't attack back. Divine Aura is the prime example. <br><br>Having a lot more hit points (Rune), being very good at avoiding getting hit (Furious) and things like that are not invulnerability. <br><br>Again, I urge you all to try it out, see how it works in game. <br><br>Sadim wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This is a question about the changes involving when a person goes invis. They way I understand it is if a person goes invis they will dissapear from your target, but if you have see invis or smiliar spell up they will not disapear. My question actualy has to do with the duration of see invis. I play a 50+ druid on tallon zek and my usual 4 buffs that I always have up are SLN, thorncoat, form of the great wolf, unless indoors, and see invis. The duration of the spells are:<br>SLN approx. 72 mins<br>Thorncoat approx. >120 mins<br>Form of the great wolf approx. 144 mins<br>See invis approx. 27 mins<br>Now you can guess which buff I am constantly refreashing and with the changes involving invis this spell is so much more important. My quesiotn is; Is there a way to increase the duration of See invis or maybe add another spell, like improved see invis, that would have a loger duration? <br><br>Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I see that as a good thing. See Invisible is now a very valuable spell in PvP (for a standard server, it's not really going to matter). The fact that it has a relatively short duration (though you are comparing the duration of a 12-16th level spell with spells of 50+ level) is a good thing. This means that you have to be attentive to your buffs, and that this spell doesn't completely negate the usefulness of invisibility. <br><br>Ashavir wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br>Skyshrine, Thurgadin and Tizmak all had similar looks for the druid armor. We wanted the Skyshrine stuff to be more distinctive."<br><br>Actually, the Thurgadin and Tizmak (and ulthork) armors aren't "similar", they are identical. The Skyshrine armor was similar in that it was a dark brown tinted tizmak. The new change to Skyshrine stuff is great, we love it =) But is there any way to get the Thurgadin armor changed a bit, even to what the old Skyshrine color was? I know druids are used to running around looking like they are in leather, its been our lot in life for over 2 years, but as it is now, a lvl 60 druid in full Thurg armor looks exactly like they are wearing cheap tizmak off lvl 30 mobs. Gear of this level should at least look like more than plain (velious) leather! ]</i></font><br><br>Nope, we're not going to change them. <br><br>I've been getting a LOT of requests for changes to this tinting or that armor appearance. <br><br>Please stop. <br><br>We're not going to revamp every piece of armor in the game to meet the desires of a few people just so we can upset other people that liked the way they looked already. In a few rare cases we've seen some changes that seem to make sense. But we are not going to go back and add this graphic to that sword or that color to your favorite piece of armor&#8230; <br><br>We certainly understand the desire to have armor that looks the way you want it to look. If you want a different look, there are plenty of other armors or items to use that look different. And no matter what we change to please one person or group, someone else isn't going to like the change. It's not worth our time to annoy one group to please another.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000230.html"><b>SZ Point System</b></a><br>Kronx-Zeb wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The real problem here is that points are only awarded for killing players, which I interpret to mean "Who cares about role-playing anymore? Here's Quake with swords." <br><br>Of course, it's only on one server so what's the big deal? Well, if it works well, it may spread to other PvP servers, then who knows? <br><br>Points just seem an exact contradiction to the nature of EQ. No, we don't know how much mana we have, but we know who's killing the most team members and racking up the points. <br><br>I just hope this is presented in the appropriate manner if it crosses to other servers. Indeed, I wouldn't mind getting bonuses for killing a bzillion orcs. I'll probably have to do that anyway, since the questing system is so screwy. ]</i></font><br><br>The points will only be visible outside the game on our site, there won't be any in-game ranking boards (as far as I know), so that should reduce the Quake feeling. <br><br>The idea is to encourage PvP. Me, I won't be looking at the point totals (except as required by my job to make sure they actually work :)), so they probably won't affect my gameplay in any case. <br><br>I certainly understand your point. No, I don't think you'll ever see anything like this on a standard server. The Orcs will be keeping their tallies on little notepads or in their heads, but not on a leader board&#8230; <br><br>Vidar- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will the insignia's of like type be stackable? If not I just could see inventorys of nothing but insignias. <br><br>Also in the most recent posts it seems to be that you've given up on the idea of insignias being for a team reward. Is this point system to replace that and the insignias will be for personal reward now? I know nothing is final yet, just wondering if the direction it seems things are going are how you think they are going. ]</i></font><br><br>Right now, yes. We're still looking into ways to aware the team, but individual point scores are easy enough to do, and don't prevent us from creating team awards. But by far the easiest thing to do is award individuals, and that's the current setup. We've not given up on the idea of team awards yet, though. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: This has probably been covered and I just missed it.<br>Q: Are the insignia stackable?<br>Q: Will we be able to turn in multiple insignia for greater reward?<br>Q: What about some unique (to this server) tradeskill items made from the insignia (similar to making a necklace from the ears of your foe)? <br><br>Nill<br>Tribunal ]</i></font><br><br>A: Yes, sorta&#8230; there are several types of insignia (4 for each god) and those will stack (you can stack minor Innoruuk insignia together, but not minor and normal; nor can you stack minor Karana with minor Brell).<br>A: Yes, sorta&#8230; Insignia will be combinable. 10 of one will give you the next one up. In fact, you can only get a Superior insignia by combining 10 Greater insignia. It will be an interesting conflict. Do I keep the 10 minor, which are worth more points, or combine them into one normal insignia that takes up less inventory space but worth less points&#8230;<br>A: Probably won't be a tradeskill.

They were accrediting more hate to pets than they should have.<P>We also fixed a bug with factions that was making it impossible to raise some factions.  There may still be factions that you can't raise because there are no methods for raising them, not because of a bug.  If you get a faction message you will also get a faction gain (or hit).<P>We also added a message that will let you know when you can no longer gain or lose faction with a certain group.  It will say:<P>Your faction standing with &lt;faction name&gt; could not possibly get any worse.<P>or<P>Your faction standing with &lt;faction name&gt; could not possibly get any better.<P>That was the essence of the patch last night.

The first edition of <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/askbrad/">Ask Brad McQuaid</a> is up at Voodoo Extreme.  Topics ranged from EverQuest, SWG, other MMORPGs and more.  Here's a blurb:<UL><b>Question: In MMORPG's such as Everquest (or in any of your other creations for that matter), I'm rather curious as to how much of the character's 'minds' arescripted or true AI.  If it is AI, do you have a dedicated 'AI guy' or do acouple other people take on the job in addition to their other work?</b><br><br>Brad's Reply : Well, it's a little bit of both.  NPCs are set up with command lists, which are really scripts, that tell them what to do under normal circumstances. In other words, a guard might be told to patrol a certain area.  But then if something unexpected happens (let's say, the NPC is attacked), then a fairly sophisticated AI system kicks in and reacts accordingly (depending on the situation, the attributes of the NPC, etc.)  And yes, we do have one guy who specializes in maintaining the AI code, however the scripts are handled by the game designers.</UL>Check out the complete first edition by following <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/games/interviews/askbrad/">this link</a>!

The new deity team server was again the big subject tackled on the Developer's Corner.  Here's today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>More Sullon Zek Feedback</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Kendrik posted on the safehouse saying that rogues can also pick pocket on Sullon. <br><br>One question. <br><br>Why are rogues allowed to pick pocket on Sullon while they're not able to on Vallon or Tallon? <br><br>Thank you for any light you can shed on this subject. <br><br>Hamm Sammich<br>Rogue of Vallon ]</i></font><br>Simply because we haven't tried it out. <br><br>There is the possibility that any, all, or none of the rules from Sullon might be moved to other servers. But we want to see how things work over a time on a full-fledged Live server before we make any decisions. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: _______________________<br>Not a problem. The system is set up so that spells won't work on anyone twenty levels below the level of the spell. So it won't be a problem for any spell under 20th level, such as Bind Affinity.<br>_______________________ <br>I want to make sure I understand this correctly. Is this true only for beneficial spells, or for ANY spell? Can a level 50 Wizard pound my level 7 Pally with Shock of Lightning, a 12th level Wizzie spell? Or is this covered under the level range for attacking? And if it is covered byt the 5 level range, is that also figured by spell level rather than caster level. I think we could all agree that the level 50 Wiz could easily devastate any 10th level group using spells under 20th level, by virtue of his Mana alone, never mind if he has some big Enchanter / Cleric buddies :)<br><br>The more I see of Sullon Zek, the more anxious I get to start a toon on the live server. Tell the team they are doing a fine job. <br>Grehaak<br>31 Ranger<br>E'ci Server ]</i></font><br><br>Well, yes and no. <br><br>The 50th level wizard can go ahead and cast his 50th level spells on your 7th level paladin. He'll be able to kill you with one spell, I suspect. <br><br>The restriction is only on most beneficial spells, not on damage spells. <br><br>Like we've been saying, Sullon is going to be a harsh server. Enter at your own risk. <br><br>Liberator wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will GM's still be issuing warnings for exploiting pathing for monsters? I can see people wanting to exploit like crazy to level up quick and have an advantage. ]</i></font><br><br>Absolutely. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: "Now if the target got a notification of this, or<br>if autoattack wouldn't come on unless you were<br>in combat range. That would be interesting.

Now, say I killed Bob(a PC on the good team). Will his Insignia that he drops, be called "Insignia of Bob". Or "Insignia of Good". Something to distinguish who you killed, or from which team. <br><br>Also, Great job on this server, I cannot wait to play on it. ]</i></font><br><br>Insignia will be linked to the deity of the character killed, not to the character itself or his team. <br><br>So Bob might drop an Insignia of Innoruuk (or Karana, depending on the life style Bob has chosen to follow&#8230;).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000225.html"><b>Hail Command</b></a><br>-Sumoner- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, on the test server they have just recently changed the hail command to say "Hail, %t" in spite of what you said here. ]</i></font><br><br>Good for us!<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000223.html"><b>Interrupted Spell Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As a Necro, I use FD quite a bit.

More like 12 hours. This way there is no reason for you to wait around for someone to get their corpse, you are not gaining anything. Otherwise you could score 75 extra points easy once you have killed him the first time. You can add a penelty for killing someone for the 4th time within 60 min as well, that should stop some of the annoying people from corpse camping. <br><br>Seems like it would make more sense if you could sacrifice the insigias to your deity. Have an NPC for each deity, someone who would accept the sacrifice. You hand it in and it gives you the posted amount of points. <br><br>The idea of it only being level 20 and above and within 5 levels is great. <br><br>The idea of losing points is good as well. <br><br>How would these lists be viewed by players? On a message board? or in the news papers?<br>Or will the top people of each team get a special title? <br><br>Personally I like the idea of the master of each team getting a title, and have it be updated each week. As for posting the top guilds and top 20 people. Put them in a seperate newspaper so people can read them in the game. <br><br>Actually, you get the points if you have them in your inventory because you will be able to turn them in for something (what, when, how are all to be determined&#8230;). You either get the points or the stuff, but not both. <br><br>We'll probably have the list on our web site someplace. That's another one of the details we're working out. <br><br>Granting in-game titles that change each week probably wouldn't work. Too much overhead for us. But I'll bring the idea up. I'll also mention the newspaper thing, but I'm not sure how that would work out either&#8230; <br><br>Thanks for the input.</UL>

This afternoon Alan <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000230.html">announced initial plans</a> for the Sullon Zek point system.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Many of you know that we've been planning to add a point system to the deity team PvP server. The idea is to track the characters that are doing the most for their team, and to allow everyone to see what the activity is like on the server.<br><br>We're working on that system now. The 'points' are already being counted, have been since the server went Live. Here's what we have in mind (and we'd appreciate any feedback on this).<br><br>Points are only gained if the target/victim is 20th level or above.<br>Points are only gained for killing characters within 5 levels of you.<br>For each kill you earn 100 points.<br>But for killing the same person a second time within a 60 minute period, you only gain 50 points.<br>For the third kill on the same person in a 60 minute period you gain 25 points.<br>For the fourth, you gain no points.<br>For any over four against the same character in a 60 minute period you lose 25 points.<br>Being killed by someone within 5 levels of you causes you to lose 25 points.<br>Insignia are worth points as long as they are in your inventory or bank (anywhere in your character's possession.) when points are tallied.<br>Lesser Insignia = 1 point<br>Normal Insignia = 5 points<br>Greater Insignia = 10 points<br>Superior Insignia = 25 points<br><br>Right now we are planning on daily or weekly updates (depending on the statistic being updated) of stats like the top 20 over all and for each team, perhaps the top 20 guilds over all and for each team.<br><br>Keep in mind: This is all subject to change!<br><br>If at some future date we feel that the point system is not working out, or if we decide to change the values of points gained or other such things, we will. Obviously we don't plan to make any changes once it is all established but keep in mind that this is an extraneous feature, a for fun thing, and it's not inviolate.<br><br>So send in your comments and suggestions.<br><br>Alan</UL>

This article also has a few screenshots and design sketches to go with.  The following excerpt discusses factions:<UL>The evil and good Combine, the Shissar, and the Vah Shir form the four basic factions on Luclin. Faction will work in very much the same way as in the rest of Norrath. Those who choose to play Vah Shir will be able to create their characters in a new starting city and will of course belong to the Vah Shir faction. It remains to be seen how existing characters will be aligned according to the four base factions; however, if your characters have previously killed a number of Kerrans, you can still gain positive Vah Shir faction on Luclin by fighting those with the opposing faction.</UL>

It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense. But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug. NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets.

You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells. This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<br>*** <br><br>On one hand, I like this change as it makes it easier to stop casting a spell, like CH. On the other, it has made a lot of items that cast spells fairly useless now. Are there plans to lower the casting times on items now that we can't sit anymore? <br><br>***<br>Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<br>*** <br><br>I'm hoping that the distance isn't too far, or you've just broke a spell that is very usefull in many situations.

You can't attack anything with Divine Aura up&#8230; so no, they couldn't. But, yes, they could conceivably avoid being attacked if they all used Divine Aura at the same time. Someone else nearby, though, is going to take a beating&#8230; <br><br>We have no plans to change the casting time on any items at this point. When those casting times were put on those items, there was no intent for the user to be able to sit down while using them. The fact that this was possible wasn't part of the determination for the times given to them&#8230; basically, they now work as intended. <br><br>Obviously we've received a lot of e-mail from people that play magicians. Obviously we think that the change makes the spell usable as intended, while removing a functionality that we didn't want it to have. I urge you all to use the spell a bit before we get into any further discussion about it. <br><br>You're welcome. :)<br><br>Skyshrine, Thurgadin and Tizmak all had similar looks for the druid armor.

New message is up on the Patch Server:<UL>June 27th, 3:00 am<br>------------------------------<br><br><br>** Gameplay Changes **<br><br>- Aggro Changes:  We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their targets.  It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense.  But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug.  NPCs are now much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets.  NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm.<br><br>- Spell and Item Interruption:  Ducking will now interrupt a spell instantly.  You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting spells.  This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though not with each other).<br><br>- Aegolism can now be clicked off.<br><br>- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.<br><br>- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.<br><br>- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.<br><br>- Several new Translocation spells have been added.<br><br>- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.<br><br>- Egress will now work indoors.<br><br>- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.<br><br>- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.<br><br>- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with Acumen.<br><br>- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.<br><br>- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.<br><br>- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.<br><br>- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage spells.<br><br>- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with haste buffs. <br><br>- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win out.  This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.<br><br>- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.  This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.<br><br>- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.<br><br>- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look more unique.<br><br>- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game.  The Circlet of Shadows, can now be found in its place.  This item differs from the original only in that it has a five-second casting time.  Existing Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing Circlets at some future date.<br><br><br>** Quest Changes **<br><br>- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.<br><br>- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. <br><br>- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in Norrath.<br><br><br>** PvP Changes **<br><br>- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.<br><br>- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target.  This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers.  The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.<br><br>- Faction hits on Rallos Zek:  Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few weeks.  For example we have corrected all misspellings of "deity" in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.<br><br>- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow Skeletons.<br> <br>- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and sitting after starting it will cancel it.<br> <br>- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101.  This was a problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over 100.<br><br>- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or "Glug... Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.<br><br>- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first person view when in combat. <br><br>- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit.  It should be a more interesting zone now.<br><br><br>** NOTE **<br><br>Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their home town.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Dragons sent in a detailed report of the slaying of RiverSource on Tarew Marr.  It was a huge battle so read up:<BLOCKQUOTE>In the zone of the Warrens, Verant has added a mysterious new mob.  It<br>is known merely as the "River Source".  As the name implies, its an<br>invisible mob at the source of the river in the warrens.   What made<br>this interesting was when a GM stated it had never been killed before.<br><br>Upon hearing that, <a href="http://www.llts.org">The Syndicate</a><br>decided the mob had to be killed.  Being as it was in the Warrens one<br>might assume it is a quick and easy midlevel kill.  That is not the<br>case.  Although the mob is a midlevel one and doesnt hit hard, it is<br>definitely not a quick kill.  This mob appears to have more HP than any<br>other mob in game.  It had anywhere from 1,000,000 HP to upwards of<br>5,000,000 HP.  A constant beating for hours on end is what it took for<br>this mob to die.  Thousands of HP damage per minute and yet it still<br>took hours to die.  Movement of the health bar was imperceptible except<br>over time.  Exact HP numbers were difficult to judge over that length of<br>time of constant attacking.  <br><br>Oddly, when it died it left no corpse and a new one spanwed nearly<br>instantly.  It is unlike Verant to add a mob that serves no purpose. <br>There must be some purpose for this strange mob with a million or more<br>HP.  What that purpose is we dont yet know.  Here is a screencap of the<br>River Source during the attack:<br><UL><a href="http://www.erols.com/lightyr/synd/riversource.jpg">Image #1</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!
