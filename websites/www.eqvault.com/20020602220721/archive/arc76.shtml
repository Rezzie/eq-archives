Gordon Wrinn visited the Gameplay Board a couple more times this evening.  Here's the round-up:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015570.html"><b>Online Store</b></a><br>I'd have to consider this a "major enhancement" patch rather than a nerf patch. Fact is that any patch that has anything in it that could be construed by anyone to be negative is called a "nerf patch" despite the overwelming number of globally positive things that are included. It's our curse and we'll live with it. <br><br>That said, there was no "timing" to the reopening of the online store. We opened it when it was ready, no sooner or later. If it would have been ready on Monday it would have been opened then. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015589.html"><b>More on 2H Weapon Issue</b></a><br>This wasn't aimed at any particular class issue. It was lessening the difference between high-delay and low-delay weapons of the same ratio. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015737.html"><b>Verant Loves Power Gamers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: How is it that Verant can do this every time? They put loot in the game just long enough for people that play 24 hours a day can scoop it all up. Then they turn around and either stop it from dropping or they move it to another much harder zone? ]</i></font><br><br>While I disagree that this happens "every time", we often only find out that a problem exists due to people "scooping up" loot in question. A problem must be encountered before it can be addressed. <br><br>This typically only happens when we implement massive content additions for the people who play the game. Though we will continue to take steps to reduce the amount that this happens, it can be said with some certainty that we'll make mistakes from time to time. <br><br>Consider how many new items went in for Kunark, and then compare that to the number later found to be problematic. It's a fairly small percentage.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015383.html"><b>New Servers</b></a><br>All of the information that can be released in regards to the new servers has been released. I realize that everyone wants to have more information, but it isn't realistic to release it at this time. Alazor's answer is a very good description of the issues at hand.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015536.html"><b>Bug?</b></a><br>Please check it today and let me know here how it's working. The last patch caused a small subset of people to crash while in game. We have fixed the problem in this patch. Providing that your crash was due to the same problem as others, it should be working again today.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015543.html"><b>2H Damage Weapons Changed</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If a faster weapon is shown to be superior why is their any need for change?]</i></font> <br><br>Because it was too far out of whack. Weapons of a given ratio should generally do a similar amount of damage. Faster weapons already get an inherent advantage with the way minimum damage works, so this was an appropriate change to keep them in line. <br><br>We'd rather not see everyone choosing the absolute fastest weapon and then throw something like the Fiery Avenger aside due to the delay.</UL>

The following are the latest posts from Verant's Gordon Wrinn:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015248.html"><b>Bad CS?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So what this tells me is No we cant explain it, yes you have five witnesses, it was a bug or an intentional train by someone but we wont help you. ]</i></font><br><br>Addressing your concerns in reverse, even if it was a train, intentional or otherwise, the GMs don't give people resurrections. Intentional training is not tolerated, but if it happens, the experience loss is a part of it. <br><br>As for it being a bug, it's not that simple. Unanticipated things can happen in EverQuest. This is designed as part of the game. Nothing should be such a sure thing that it can be quantified with absolute certainty. Most likely, these guys were pulled out by someone else, and weren't back at their spawn points when you pulled the other creatures. <br><br>You had some unexpected nasties come up after you. I would bet that it got your heart racing :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So that tells me that you either assume Im lying or dont care. I think the majority of verant care, so that leaves me with you assume im a liar. That is REALLy infuriating ]</i></font><br><br>I don't think that its fair to say that the GM thought *you* were lying, however I would ask you to understand that it is very easy for someone to get 4 friends to back them up on something. With little real consequences to dishonesty if it cannot be caught, there is little to keep people honest. As a result, we have to treat everything on a global scale. <br><br>The GMs are now banning people outright when it is absolutely known that they are lying. However, even though this is fairly well-known and leading to many people being banned every day, people keep trying to get by on these issues. <br><br>In an ideal world, no one would try to get one by on the GM, and then the GMs would be able to hand out resurrections whenever they are petitioned. I really wish we could do that and maintain the integrity of the game.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015238.html"><b>Knowing Your Game</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: hey gordon know your own game before you post]</i></font> <br><br>What do you mean? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: [Clerics are] also the only wis caster without ...see-invis...<br>rangers don't get see-invis]</i></font> <br><br>Is your problem with these two statements? <br><br>Rangers cast, but aren't "casters" in generally accepted vernacular. They are hybrids.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015242.html"><b>Weird Network Status Problem</b></a><br>Erm... I was about to reply suggesting that you refresh your cache, but I'm happy I took a look before I did :)  Apparently the file was updated with a version from back in May. I've forwarded the issue to our WebOps group. I apologize for the problem. <br><br>To answer your question, yes there is a patch going in today at 7:00am PDT (GMT-7).<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015216.html"><b>A Suggestion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just an idea here, since there are players in house that play each class, and every class is balanced, then has there been any thoughts of having them post here?]</i></font> <br><br>We need to speak with a unified voice to maintain our focus. Not everyone who plays every class necessarily has full view of the big picture. There's also the point that these others have jobs that they do, and they need to get their work done. Finally, I'd prefer to see the focus of the board drift away from class-issues. Being honest, these are situations that can often only be made worse through extended discourse. Anyone who has taken the time to build friendships can get groups if they've fostered the required friendships, and can contribute to those groups. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Or having them set up a page where everyone can go to and read comments on the class, its strengths, its weaknesses, strategies, and other class specific things such as quests etc??]</i></font> <br><br>There's already several websites out there that specialize in information of this type without making it part of an official information release. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015234.html"><b>Procs</b></a><br>At this time there are no weapons which proc more or less than any other. There was at one time a change made to the mistwalker to make it proc less, but that was later removed in favor of another change. <br><br>The proc rates are a percentage chance modified by dexterity, the type of weapon (1H vs 2H), and the delay rating on the weapon.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015237.html"><b>New Kunark Zone?</b></a><br>It's a possible future expansion. It may or may not come live in the future. It's too early to say anything for certain in regards to this.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014176.html"><b>More Space at the Bank!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The Bank storage space allowed for a character is pitiful. Couldn't something be done about this?]</i></font> <br><br>I'm sorry, but we really don't want to increase the maximum amount of storage space required by each account. Remember that any change is exponential. It's not one character that gets more storage space, it's 8 characters by 34 servers by nearly 300K subscribers. It's a fairly large amount of data on that scale.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015196.html"><b>Haste</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Changing the way haste stacking works, at this point in the game's life will have a HUGE impact on class balance.]</i></font> <br><br>I disagree, fixing the bug pretty much affects everyone equally, and actually benefits people in many cases. I imagine that most were unaware of the bug and were buffing with maximum haste anyway. Now they can be secure in their spells meaning something. Not to mention, we can now look forward to the value of the different haste items being appropriate as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015215.html"><b>More on FBSS Nerf Issue</b></a><br>Thanks Suron1x, that's an accurate description of the issue. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think it's bad that the entire game was balanced by playtesters who were all at the haste cap, a situation that is now no longer going to be common]</i></font> <br><br>You may have a point, but its not an absolute. Not everyone has both haste items and haste spells available, and those are the only ones who stand to be negatively affected by this change. Chances are, if you already have a high-level haste item, and have access to a haste spell as well, the cap is still very attainable. It just can't be done with the lowest level item haste and spell-haste available.<br> <br>I am quite happy that we were finally able to track down the cause of everyone's complaints regarding one haste item being no better than another.</UL>

Today's gigantic Patch Message is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>September 19th, 7:00am<br>------------------------<br> <br><b>*Level 1 Character Purge*</b><br> <br>The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7).  Any level 1 characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted.  If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play them between now and 9/27.  <br> <br><br><b>***Patch Day***</b><br> <br>As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions to the game.  <br> <br><b>*New Epic Quests*</b><br> <br>We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" style quests for every class in the game (including paladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br> <br>Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br> <br><b>*Class Issues*</b><br> <br>Rangers:<br> <br>Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all melee-centric classes.  In the course of these tests we determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the following changes:<br> <br>- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br> <br>Monks:<br> <br>High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty.  The additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br> <br>Cleric:<br> <br>Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are incompatible with that configuration.  We have therefore removed the cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br> <br>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased.  <br> <br><br><b>*Fungal Regrowth*</b><br> <br>"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell.  It was being used as an offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target.  Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern.  The spell was reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<br> <br><br><b>*Attack Speed Buffs*</b><br> <br>In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual component.  This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" equipment and spells.  The downside to this is that those who usually have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.<br> <br><br><b>*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*</b><br> <br>Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address disparities in risk and reward.  For the most part, the quality of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the "rares" from Sebilis.<br> <br><br><b>*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*</b><br> <br>In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand.  Included in this change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip.  The delay on these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their acquisition.<br> <br>In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified.  The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<br> <br><br><b>*Server Selection Screen*</b><br> <br>It has come to our attention that new players often think that the high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else is there, it must be a good server.  However, in Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay.  Therefore we have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in "green" in the server selection window.  The preferred servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server rather than cause overpopulation.<br> <br><br><b>*Custom Emotes and AFK*</b><br> <br>Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. For instance: <br> <br>/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. <br> <br>...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it." <br> <br>Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK.  Type "/AFK <message>" (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message.  For instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with "Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.<br> <br><br><b>*Skill Gain*</b><br> <br>The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats.  This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve at a greater rate.<br> <br><br><b>*Trade Skills Enhanced*</b><br> <br>Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things to be discovered once in game.  <br> <br>In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented.  Players will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills. This includes: <br> <br>- Baking<br>- Blacksmithing<br>- Brewing<br>- Jewelcraft<br>- Tailoring<br>- Fletching<br>- Pottery <br> <br>Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to exceed 200.  Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering.  Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill. <br> <br>The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project.  Further enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.<br> <br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Steve and David!

The <a href="http://www2.eqvault.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid969371022,65593,">Reader Responses</a> for the "What do you want from Norrath?" article have been posted in <a href="/lore/shadoe">Shadoe's Corner</a>.  This is by far one of the more interesting reader reaction stories Shadoe's has done and with the patch today this would be a great way to pass away the time.  Here's an excerpt:<UL>I know when one of my articles has hit the target squarely in the bullseye when two things happen. First, it must start up controversy on both sides of an argument. If I get nothing but e-mail coming in agreeing with me, then I feel like I've merely wasted my time stating the obvious. If I get nothing but e-mail coming in disagreeing with me, I've either failed to make my point or I need to reevaluate what it is I said.<br><br>The second thing that needs to happen is a wide dissemination. Word needs to get out to a widespread readership to the point where enough people actually found the material in the article interesting enough to read in the first place.</UL>Enjoy!

From Eric:<BLOCKQUOTE>    Greetings,<br><br>    EQu, the program many people have been using to edit their eqclient.ini<br>file, has been undergoing major advancements towards it's goal of becoming<br>an all-in-one EverQuest utility program.<br><br>    A new patching system has been implemented to EQu, which performs in a<br>similar fashion to the EverQuest patching process we're all familiar with.<br>This allows users of EQu to obtain newer versions and all the necessary<br>files they need without accessing the EQu website for updates in the form of<br>zip files.  This new patching system is key in allowing EQu to grow like<br>crazy without encumbering the users with messing around with update files<br>and all the repetitive busy work in windows explorer and winzip that goes<br>with it.<br><br>    The first new addition to EQu is a server status page.  The next<br>addition planned is a log file parser, and future additions are still an<br>open book - users of EQu are encouraged to submit their ideas as to what<br>type of tool they'd like to see in EQu.<br><br>    While the servers are down today, my bored fellow EQ addicts are invited<br>to visit EQu's website and try it out for themselves:<br><br>    <a href="http://members.phoenixdsl.com/~qbe/EQU/">http://members.phoenixdsl.com/~qbe/EQU/</a><br><br>    Thanks, and enjoy.<br><br>    Eric</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

The following word was sent in by Azriel:<BLOCKQUOTE> POVAR NEWBIE EVENT - 20 September 2000, 7PM EST<br> <br> I awoke today to find my older sister missing from her bunk. I have searched the area, and now suspect foul play. My sister is a formidable person, with many enemies, and yet all her items of power were found laying strewn around her bedroom. She would never have left our abode without them. I have followed the trail as far as I can, but the attitude of the guards of Qeynos prevent me from venturing further, they seem to want to lay waste to my young inexperienced self. I am searching for brave GROUPS of adventurers to rescue my sister. I have a few clues which may lead in the correct direction, but I can follow them no further. If you're a brave adventurer, and would like to help me search for my sister, please we are gathering in Qeynos Hills, close to the border of West Karana at 7pm 20 September (this date and time in the mystical world knowns as Eastern Standard Time, Earth). I will give ALL my earthly possessions to the group of adventurers that return my sister to me alive. And so far many donations have been given by friends of my sister to add to the rewards. We are seeking groups of six adventurers from the 1st to the 18th Cycle. Prepare well, for if they captured my sister, then they must be powerful themselves.<br> <br>Young Warrior Azriel, brother of Angelodeth Azriel</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

This just cracks me up:<BLOCKQUOTE>On September 18th, the year of our Lord 2000 at exactly 11:50:32 PM PST<br>Dwynn Stormhammer of Arcane Legacy performed an outstanding feat beyond<br>comparison:  The Snipage of Post 10000 on Rodcet Nife's notorious Rant<br>thread.  Dwynn's own words best describe the event:<br><br>	"Our goal has been reached<br><br>	It has been a long time since Orb firs posted his Rant, which grew and<br>flourished into the monstrosity known as Rant. 	Friendships have been<br>formed, and many laughs have been had.<br><br>	I would like to thank my brother, Cadmus, and my friend Baglo.

I received the following from Dirge:<BLOCKQUOTE>Cresting the last of several gentle hills, the exiled<br>Teir&#8217;dal woman narrowed her eyes, focusing on the<br>stoic grandeur of the walls of her second home&#8230;<br>Qeynos.  Amorsaylnn Frost smiled to herself.  The<br>humans had come to accept her, though many still<br>harbored some doubts about her intentions.  Her musing<br>was cut short by a cry of pain.  "Ahhhgggg&#8230;"  It<br>emerged from a young man, leaning against the<br>unforgiving stones of the wall.  <br><br>Amor turned, fumbling in her pack for spare bandages,<br>but his wounds were quite serious, beyond her ability<br>to mend.  He tried to speak.  "Those mangy dogs put up<br>a tough fight.  If I don&#8217;t make it back to the Clan<br>House soon, it&#8217;ll all be over for me."  There was a<br>brave, determined look in his eyes.  Amor had seen<br>death many times in her short life, but most often<br>people crumpled, whimpering for forgiveness and<br>safety.  This man was different, strong and would<br>accept death if she chose to embrace him.<br><br>"What dogs?" Amor asked, trying to support him.<br><br>He answered between gasps for breath.  "It&#8217;s those<br>Darkpaws&#8230; They&#8217;ve beat me pretty badly&#8230; but they&#8217;ll<br>get theirs soon enough!"<br><br>Amorsaylnn was not very interested in politics.  Truth<br>be told, she was very much a mercenary, having been<br>hired by another Teir&#8217;dal known as Shivrehel Despana<br>and his House, Winterborne.  She had fled Neriak in<br>the night, sent by her father, Makaz, to find this<br>Teir&#8217;dal and follow his path.  As it turned out, he<br>had strange connections with Lady Vox, the mythical<br>dragoness of the North.  Now she found herself<br>traveling frequently with his consort, a barbarian<br>witch by the name of Shar Hel Despana&#8230; and they made a<br>good team.<br><br>But being near Shiver meant hearing a lot of rumor and<br>suggestion.  He was a politician, at heart.  The last<br>bit of news she had heard before heading out to the<br>southern reaches of the Karanas was about a man named<br>Tomer Instogle, a member of the Silent Fist Clan.  He<br>was missing since he helped try and defend the Qeynos<br>Gates against the gnoll forces.<br><br>Amor knew there had been no formal alliance between<br>the monks of the Silent Fist and House Winterborne,<br>but they were, in theory, given to a similar purpose. <br>They were sworn to upholding the strength of Qeynos. <br>She whispered to the wounded man.  "I will take you to<br>your Clan House, Tomer."  He asked that she carry his<br>backpack for him.  It was the least they could do.  In<br>moments, she had escorted the monk to his House and<br>handed his backpack to his brothers that came to<br>assist.<br><br>Master Seta Bakindo was greatly relieved.  "We thought<br>that was the last we&#8217;d seen of him.  Thank you!"<br><br>The Teir&#8217;dal nodded, smiling slightly.  "It was the<br>least I could do.  House Winterborne is quite<br>interested in assisting the other noble Houses of<br>Qeynos.  These gnolls have caused much harm.  We would<br>be your allies, if you are interested."<br><br>Tomer was overcome with joy.  "Oh, you have the<br>makings of a true hero.. The Silent Fist Clan is proud<br>to have you as ally. May your soul guide and protect<br>you through these chaotic times!"<br><br><br>OOC ~ Winterborne will be hosting a newbie give-away<br>on the Xegony server, Monday the 25th at 8 PM EST. <br>Characters of level one (1) through five (5) who are<br>not anonymous may turn in three gnoll scalps at the<br>gates to Qeynos for a reward from among the following<br>prizes: medium banded armor, raw silk armor, fine<br>steel and forged weapons, and jade-silver rings.  Each<br>character may receive a maximum of three prizes (nine<br>gnoll scalps, total).  We will also be providing<br>buffs, healing, drinks, and excellent company&#8212;all<br>in-character&#8212;for those participating.

More information was posted by Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board this evening.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015100.html"><b>Patch Hints</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Since the patch was delayed, can ya give us any clues as to what we can expect? From what Ive read from you so far it sound exciting.]</i></font> <br><br>A slew of enhancements and a handful of nerfs that we couldn't avoid any longer. I'm hoping that everyone will keep the posting rules in mind tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015123.html"><b>BoB Tournament Rewards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Does this ring fair to Nanak who won the BoB warrior tournament? He got a namechange, the level 60 one, and nothing more than that. In all fairness he should be given a very powerful special weapon that nobody else in the game can have as a reward for winning that<br><br>Please Verant I think you owe it to him. ]</i></font><br><br>Why? The reward for the competition is winning the competition itself. It's an event put on for the higher level folk who wish to offer themselves as the best of the best. Why should an additional reward be necessary? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015162.html"><b>Keeping Your Cool</b></a><br>I'd really appreciate it if people didn't respond to those posts from people who think that they are "going out in style" by coming in here and spamming racial slurs and profantiy. There's nothing "stylish" about it, and replying to their posts only encourage them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015167.html"><b>FBSS</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Please make the FBSS no drop.]</i></font> <br><br>We really don't like the idea of going around and making every desired item NODROP. Brad made a post a couple of days ago to that effect. <br><br>In any case, I doubt that it will be as valuable after tomorrow. We found a bug with the way "haste" items stack with "haste" spells. Basically, even the worst haste item combined with the worst haste spell would put the wearer at the haste cap. This basically invalidated the better haste items and spells, and explains why people have been saying that the newer haste items aren't any better than the FBSS. <br><br>This is being fixed in tomorrow's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014979.html"><b>Disable Destroy Button During Looting</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In most situations we are forced to speed loot to avoid futher deaths. I have destroyed several items in these situations, items that where difficult to acquire or expensive to purchase. I realize that there is a Button to confirm item destruction, but thats just another button to have to click during loots. Most of the time in dungeons the game lags bad enough without having to deal with more twitching.]</i></font> <br><br>I'd have a hard time convincing the guys that yet another level of security is needed here. Sure, I've accidently destroyed items while looting, and when that happened, I turned fast item destroy off. I'd hate to not have the ability to destroy and item while looting, since that's where the majority of my destroys take place. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015023.html"><b>Mages and mana Regen Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Will Magicians ever get Mana Regen spells? it really seems to me that all other pure casters have this. It would greatly help mage Magicians a more robust class.]</i></font> <br><br>Beyond meditation, no. Mages are pretty robust as it is, and the complaints that I've heard don't appear to be tied to mana.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/015049.html"><b>Real Issue on Posting</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Many players post with more than one idea/issue/rant/etc on mind. The post is usually mixed with emotion and feelings and facts all jumbled up. Next step is Gordon (or whomever) reads the post and answers the post. Now the postee may have had 8 points in the post but all revolving around a central issue. Gordon (or whomever) replys to 1 or 2 or more of the points but may miss the main point. <br><br>I suggest that we number our issues 1 by 1, making it hard for Gordon (or whomever) to "accidently" miss answering a point. Make your posts clear and concise. What Im suggesting is an unofficial format.]</i></font> <br><br>It's a good idea. Clear and concise points are more likely to be addressed. This of course assumes that it is a point that I want to address. In all fairness, those 8 point posts that you mention often only have 1 or 2 points that it would be beneficial to address.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014462-2.html"><b>Harvest: Make It Like Harm Touch/Lay of Hands</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There is one thing that REALLY bothers me about Harvest though. It permanently uses up a spell slot. Now, you might say necros need to use a spell slot for lich, but once they cast it then they can unmem it until they need it again. Same goes for clarity.<br><br>Wizards can not afford to EVER unmem harvest ]</i></font><br><br>It's a tradeoff. Wizards decide whether or not they want to have the spell available always, and "pay" for that decision with a spell slot should they choose that they do. <br><br>It's a good enough spell that it is worth a slot, at least for those who keep it memmed all of the time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/011329-2.html"><b>Why is it NO-Drop?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Verant-Abashi: Why is this Item NO DROP???<br>Item: Sarnak Earring of Station ]</i></font><br><br>I don't know, perhaps it's used for a quest? <br><br>Anyway, this really doesn't seem like that big of a deal. There are over 10K items in game now, and as we get more and more it gets harder to insert them into the same mesh as others. Some are bound to have stats and settings that have no great plan behind them, or have one that isn't apparent at the time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014922.html"><b>Playing Your Class</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: yes, the only answer we have got, was something like: learn to play your class right and show others what you can do. i found this very insulting. someone who has no clue about hybrids (not a flame gordon, noone knows everything about every class..... )past 50 tells a lot of good SKs to learn more.......]</i></font> <br><br>Thankfully I have someone playing every class pretty close at hand :)  Yes, that includes the SK. One of the most avid EQ players in house here has a high level SK built from scratch. He's also one of the decision-makers, so it works out fairly well. Suffice it to say that he thinks that SKs are fantastic, and I'll agree with him on that point, despite the issues that you brought up. </UL>

There's a few posts to report today that Gordon Wrinn made recently, and for a nice Sunday change all of them are light hearted.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014721.html">post #1</a>:<UL>This taken from MSNBC:<br>"Gordon was moving at 60 mph and was expected to become a hurricane sometime Saturday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said."<br><br>Gordon, are you leaving Verant to create large waves and intense winds in the Gulf of Mexico?<br><br><b><i>Rofl :)<br><br>-Gordon<br>-A mere storm at the moment...</b></i></UL>Here <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014642.html">post #2</a>:<UL>One day little red riding hood was going through the woods and stumbled upon a small bag on the path. Once she picked it up she realized it was really a rat ear. "EWWWWWWW" she said as she threw the disgusting article away and it magically became a small bag again. So she walked a little further along the path and a HUGE!!! guy with blue paint all over his body was on it. So she said "Hi I"m little red riding hood" Well he said "OK OK I'LL GIVE YOU SOW JUST STOP ANNOYING ME!!!" and so he cast SoW on little red riding hood. So along red goes down the path and passes through the agro radius of a Shadow Wolf. Since she is running so fast it doesn't catch up to her until she reaches her grandma's house. She tries opening the door, but can't. Then she taps on the door and it opens for her! So in she goes and she sees three people: Mira Sayer, Nilipus, and her grandmother. <br><br>Mira and Nilipus leave after Red enters. So Red riding hood gives her grandmother the basket, and then her grandmother says "Thank you very much dear, here is a little something for bringing me [dencher cleaner]. <br>You receive 1 silver 4 copper.<br>Your faction with OldPeople has gone up<br>Your faction with Mayong Mystmoore has gone up<br>Your faction with Nagafen has gone down<br>Your faction with Bixies has gone down<br>You gain experience!<br><br>Then out of the wall runs in the shadow wolf and bites red for 5 points of damage. She screams for help but to no avail until a newbie hunter walks by and enters the house. With an agile thrust he slays the shadow wolf. Then he says "d4mn, n0 ph4t l3w7" and then he looks at red and says "give me mny plz". Red give him the silver and copper she got from her grandma and the newbie says "You sux0r, and U r st00p1d."<br><br>Fifteen minutes later red receives a tell from Etermelody saying her name is against the naming policy as it is based on a popular novel so then she receives a name above her head which says "Limmle Reda Ridon Herld".<br><br>The End<br><br><b><i>I'm sorry, but the Crimson Hooded Cloak of the Equestrian is severely overpowered and as such will no longer drop. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014359.html">post #3</a>:<UL>When he plays, I'm sure he doesn't play his character named Abashi.

Gordon was up late again making the following posts to the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014636.html"><b>Trade Skill Speciailization</b></a><br>There's been a number of requests along these lines. I'll bring the issue up at the Tuning Meeting Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014638.html"><b>The Delayed Patch</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Im fine with it. But the problem is that i have an error / crashing problem that this patch fixes. why cant i get the appropriate files for that, or why cant the be released befroe the full patch?]</i></font> <br><br>Because other changes to the files for that require underlying changes in other parts of the patch. The client is also tied to the version of code running on the server in most cases. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive spent hours on test server w/ no crashes, but on Torv it crashes in 10 minutes or less every time i log. The solution is out there, and i just need to get my hands on it, how is this usually handled?]</i></font> <br><br>I really apologize for the delay.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014639.html"><b>More Illusions</b></a><br>Unfortunatley "Illusion: Animation" wouldn't work, as the race of an animation is one that we call the "Invisible man". The only reason that the sword and shield show up on the animation is because he's actually got them equipped. <br><br>An enchanter wouldn't have those items equipped, so wouldn't show up. :(<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014614.html"><b>Splits</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is there any way that when you lock a thread due to size you start another on the same subject, have seen it done on a few boards, maybe this one too and Im just blind]</i></font> <br><br>We used to do that, however it seemed to turn the thread into a contest to get it to split. I think we had one thread up to about 12 splits before we decided to stop splitting them.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014621.html"><b>Direct3D Mip Mapping</b></a><br>We have a plan for the MipMap issues, as well as others present with some of the more advanced features and performance found in new games. It involves upgrading the level of DirectX that the client uses. This would require that everyone update their DirectX drivers to the most recent version. <br><br>We'll have more information to post about this next week. We plan to give a couple of weeks lead-time before making such a big change, so the updates won't be in Tuesday's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014625.html"><b>Credit Card Safety</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I can't seem to communicate to my mom that giving out one's credit card number to Everquest is a reasonably safe procedure. She believes that under no circumstances whatsoever should anyone give that out. Naturally, this prevents me from trying out my brand spanking new game. Could anybody out there tell me where to go to inform her better about this, or at least give some information coming from an experienced user?]</i></font> <br><br>This is actually one of the things that keeps internet commerce from growing faster than it is, and is mostly due to misconceptions spawned by the entertainment industry (movies, television). Our interface uses a secure encrypted protocol to ensure that the data remains safe. <br><br>In my opinion, purchasing services on the internet from reputable companies is far more secure than handing your card to the waiter at the local restaurant. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014551-3.html"><b>Board Problem</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Gordon or UBBAdmin can something be done about Snoota and his "group"? ]</i></font><br><br>I really don't think that there's anything wrong with a little levity to take the edge off.

Well I was wondering if this ever could happen. I know that one of the best times me and my girlfriend have in the game is when our characters are the same level but sometimes you just have things that happens where you get a level or so ahead of the other. I think this would be a good time to bring it back up with the response to Abshi's poll on how many families play the game together. ]</i></font><br><br>I mentioned this to the team a while back in an email, but we had a few things going on at the time that were monopolizing the time of the developers. I'll bring it up again in the Tuning meeting Monday.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014519.html"><b>No Drop</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Make all the items NO DROP. If you want something then earn it.]</i></font><br><br>This is actually covered in the FAQ: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014508.html"><b>A Complaint</b></a><br>It's possible that they may be using the wrong animation, but that should be controlled by the type of skill that it uses. Perhaps it's a dwarf thing. Do you know if gnomes have a similar problem? I'm just looking for as much information as possible before taking it to the team.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014488.html"><b>Abuse and Harassment</b></a><br>The policies regarding name changes, and the fact that they usually aren't done except in cases of a violation of the policy, is to keep people from using namechanges to escape their bad reputation. I realize in this case you want a name change to escape someone ELSES bad reputation, however the GMs have no way to know whether or not that really is the case. As you might imagine, people with bad reputations really aren't all that straightforward about their situations when talking to GMs. That other person with the similar name could very well be asking the GM for a name change because of you. <br><br>If we do this name change we open ourselves to doing all sorts of them on the basis of the name being similar to someone elses. As we cannot maintain our plan of having reputation as a factor if this happens, the current policy is the only fair one. <br><br>My best suggestion is for you to work on building th reputation of your name and explain that you aren't the person with the bad reputation. This should be pretty easy, especially when that person is online. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014498.html"><b>Abashi and Lum</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My personal choice is #2. I've grown tired of seeing the same old retoric in response to issues. I've grown tired of seeing well thought out posts with logical, proven empirical data in them get seemingly blown off.]</i></font> <br><br>Hi Brent, welcome back to the boards. <br><br>I frequently give complete explanations to the issues, for at least the first few times that they come up. The FAQ is a good example of those complete explanations. However, once all of those explanations are stated, and more information is requested over and over, we wind up at a pure and simple "No, it's not up for debate, and we won't do it." Now I don't think that I've ever used those words, and I usually try to add some padding, but I try to be as straight forward as possible in these instances. <br><br>There are other cases where it's impossible to come up with a quantifiable explanation of the way things are. This is espicially true when the reason behind something is that it just wasn't what we had in mind. This lead of course to the "Not in the vision" parodies. I even tried to put something in the FAQ concerning these issues, but they still come up, leading me back to a simple "No." <br><br>The reason why clerics don't get SOW, rangers don't get see-invis, shamans don't get clarity, and magicians don't get summon corpse are basically all the same: It wasn't what we had in mind for those classes. There's no way to quantify this with a formula. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Besides, most of the game is not up for debate. What Verant does is they take user input and feedback, but then use their own judgement. If they think something is underpowered, then they will change it. Likewise if they think something is overpowered. It's a small, but important distinction; and it gets blurred quite frequently.]</i></font> <br><br>Very true and well said. We have to be the ultimate arbitrators of what should, shouldn't, will, and will never be. If we don't take up that role, the game will lose focus and sooner or later become something that people do not want to play. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014506.html"><b>"Please remove warning spam from Song of Travel "</b></a><br>Good point.

Brad talked about the delays surrounding the upcoming patch on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/014405.html">the following thread</a>:<UL><I>The good news is that we have a LOT of new content going into the next patch. The bad news is that it's taking us a while to debug it and make it right.<br><br>That's why we've had to reschedule the patch.<br><br>We put the new data and code up on the Test server and look for problems. Twice now we've found problems close enough to the scheduled patch time that we felt it necessary to delay.<br><br>I apologize for the frustration many of you feel because you are planning your playtime around these patches, but this is a big patch and we want to get it as right as possible.<br><br>We appreciate your understanding,<br><br>-Brad</I></UL>
