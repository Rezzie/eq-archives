Here's an excerpt:<UL>In order to make a more graphically enhanced world, a number of graphical support changes are being made. Changes to object textures are now dynamic in nature. They will get more detailed as you approach them and loose detail as you get further away. Very much like how our eyes see the world. This design makes it possible to pack areas with more intricate details as well as being more realistic. Textures will blend into each other making a smooth and seamless transition from one another.</UL>Shadows of Luclin, for those who don't know, will be the 3rd EverQuest expansion pack.

Shadoe has compiled the <a href="http://cgi.eqvault.ign.com/lore/admin/viewnews.cgi?newsid993264820,50713,">Reader Response for the Questing for EQ Comedy</a> editorial.  It's a great follow-up to the original article with some great commentary from people around the community.  Check out this excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><b>If you're telling me the strip isn't funny... fine. I don't mind that. I've never claimed to be funny. As a matter of fact on numerous occasions I've stated specifically that I am an illustrator and not funny in the least. If that's a reason not to read the strip, that's fine too. I'm not offended by people choosing to ignore my opinionated, if colorful, ravings. </b><br><br>I never said I was going to stop reading your material, Woody.  Nor that of Scott Kurtz or anyone else who feels the need to shroud their soapbox-standing in the guise of comedy.  If you review the article, you'll notice that I never encouraged my readers to do so, either.  I don't do boycotts; I make simple observations.  It's up to the readers to decide if they concur. <br><br>You may never have made the claim to be funny in so many words, but for you to make the above statement is like someone claiming they're not a politician while at the same time running for U.S. Congress.  I certainly don't buy it, and I fancy nobody else will either.  Your claim to humor lies in your work, which is copiously funny, by and large.  That, sir, speaks far louder than words and sets a distinct precedent to your fans, whether or not you choose to acknowledge it. </BLOCKQUOTE>As always, thanks Shadoe!

But there's something we both missed. You can tell if you can attack someone by simply hitting the autoattack button. Without a rather tremendous overhaul of the game system, this will always be the easiest way to tell if someone is on the opposite team.

We guess, we all guess, about what exactly it is that most players want, but nobody actually knows. <br><br>As for that sort of spell&#8230; no, I don't think such a spell will be created. For the same reason that we don't plan to add a summoning suppression type spell. There are, sadly, cases where summoning is an important way to prevent certain exploits. We don't plan to create spells that prevent summoning.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000223.html"><b>Effects on Bard Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will this change effect the bard songs? If this fix is to prevent people from sitting to med while they are using an item, or casting a spell, will this change make it so that us bards will no longer be able to sit while singing our songs? It is nice to be able to sing Hymn and sit down to get the extra couple hp's a tick, or when we get low on mana because of the 39 charm song and we need to med, if we can't at least have a song going durring this time to help the party out, then might as well say goodbye to the doubling mana regen we get while sitting, as we won't be allowed to sit anymore. <br><br>As an aside, it will also eliminate a fun taunt bards have with shamans and druids, as we run past them backwards while ducking and singing selo's. <br><br>Please for once think of the bards before you put something like this on the live servers,<br>Harmani Camlhach, Bard of Kelethin (Vallon Zek) ]</i></font><br><br>This won't affect bard songs. In fact, it gives a little bonus to bards. <br><br>Here's how it will work, as I understand it. <br><br>When you are casting a spell or using an item that casts a spell or a song, you will no longer be able to sit down. You will still be able to sit while singing. In fact, you will now be able to start singing while already seated. <br><br>Ducking will immediately interrupt the casting of any spell or the use of any item. It shouldn't affect songs at all. <br><br>Over all this will make things easier for casters of all sorts. <br><br>Werdse_Wisdem <br><br>"The main reason for this change is to fix an 'exploit'. "<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm guessing you're referring to being able to activate an item, then sit until just before it goes off to meditate, then stand for the resolution. <br><br>You said 'exploit' in quotes. IS this an exploit? Is doing it in convention to the EULA? Or is "'exploit'" in this sense "something we don't want to happen, so we're changing it" but not punishable? ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, that's what we're changing. As for punishment and 'exploit' and all that, don't worry about it. It won't be possible to do it after the patch anyhow, so it won't really matter one way or the other.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000225.html"><b>NPCs and Illusions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Ok, wait a minute. You're talking about it giving us to much freedom of movement. How would it be any different than if we had invisibilty cast on us? Except that it effects factions, causing some monsters to be more friendly, and guards to be less friendly. If you're worried about the pet hanging around, just cause the pet to freak out like it does when you cast invis. You can either be a monster or have a pet. I think the ability to turn into a monster would be awesome! It would be so much fun to run around EC as a GIANT! Think of the ruckus we could cause! <br><br>Kishan ]</i></font><br><br>Ruckuses are great. I've got no problem with that. <br><br>But an illusion is different than invisibility. There is no 'see invisibility' for illusions. The places where we've purposefully staged NPCs that you just can't sneak by would be compromised by such spells. NPCs treat different body types differently, and an illusion essentially gives you a body type. <br><br>Yes, we could spend a lot of time working it out so that such a spell could exist, making special exceptions in code for each illusion in each zone. But that's not practical, it just isn't justifiable to apply the resources to create a single spell and then the resources to fix all the bad situations that such a spell would invariably create. <br><br>Nobody denies that it's an interesting idea. It's just not something we're planning to do. <br><br>Xombie wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Although I am sure that you will get several responses such as this, I still feel that it is worth a moment to suggest it. Perhaps the solution to the faction issue would be to make the caster KOS to everything while using a mimic type of illusion spell. Please announce ahead of time that this would be the case and I believe that most enchanters would accept this limitation. I believe that to prevent problems resulting from excessive polygon count, you could check the 'giant' flag of the target (or whatever the 'thou shalt not mes or stun' flag is) as an indicator as to whether it would be allowed. This would prevent people from becoming dragons and other graphic intensive creatures. ]</i></font><br><br>I sure have received several. :)<br><br>It just doesn't work like that. When you look like a thing, you are that thing for all practical purposes. And we can't just make all of your factions KOS. That would mean storing at least two versions of your factions, meaning more server storage, more overhead&#8230; It's just not practical. <br><br>I hate to say that sometimes decisions come down to matters of best bang for the buck. But sometimes they do. <br><br>Faerenka wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'd like to point out that the reason of not giving us moster illusion, that we would have too much freedom to roam monster areas, is somewhat silly. Giving a High Elf the freedom to roam about in the Dark Elf city (and vice versa) might be considered the same thing. As far as the body type thing goes I am sure you know what you are talking about. <br><br>I think it would be cool to have a minor illusion for our pet :)]</i></font><br><br>Freedom in Neriak is one thing. Freedom to explore other places is different. We've obviously intended to allow enchanters the freedom to explore starting cities. And what I'm trying to tell you is that there are most certainly other places where we intentionally do not want enchanters to have that freedom. <br><br>At least you accept the body type thing. :)  I was getting worried that nobody would&#8230; <br><br>Minor Illusion for pets&#8230; hmm&#8230; interesting&#8230; I'll pass that on. <br><br>I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just explaining how it works. Creatures see body types. They react to them. It is one of the factors that determines how an NPC will react to you. Yes, sure, we could probably design some seriously complicated code that would allow a spell to work, but the effort would be pretty serious, and we're not ready at this time to trade that effort for this one spell when it might buy us better things.</UL>

We received the following report form Loreths Leafblade:<BLOCKQUOTE>I am but a Ranger of the 20th season, but what I saw was enough bravery to challenge even Veeshan. What I saw were the forces of Good under the banner of Tunare against an unknown Evil. Here is the ballard of the Battle of the Mill:<br><br>The day was quite, and all was well. Warriors like Sepis and Chanters like Aeonan were clearing the land of the Evil Sarnaks. The day was good. Then, like music to many ears, sounds happened. No one could explain it. Not even the Brave Thori who was an inspiration to all throughout the future fighting. The sound was mystifing. Then, By Tunare herself, the sky turned Blood red, and screams were heard throughout the Lake area. Methus the Druid, Mkae, Xorbraazz the Monk, Drevinn the Bard, Sindili, and Spiderr all reported of strange Goblins appearing, headed towards the Mill. That's when Mahon, Thori, Kristie and others started to make their stand. By the Reassuring words of Tunare, Elders and Young folk all threw themeselves into the goal of protecting the mill. Even though they were up against uknown forces from unknown origins, they showed bravery umatched. Everyone threw themselves against the new Goblins, Fighters, Warriors and Spell Casters. And by the power of Tunare, They were repulsed. The light triumphed over the Darkness. The sky slowly turned to black, then back to blue and all was quiet. An eerie silence feel over the assembled. Then, the moaning of the wounded, followed by the cheers of the victors. Then, vallant folk such as Torent prayed to their Gods and offered Ressurections to the needy. Tunare triumphed once again, And all was safe, until the next time, when the forces of evil will meet the Defenders of the Mill.<br><br>That is the story as I told it.

It was a quiet day on the Developer's Corner altogether.  Here's the scoop:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000224.html"><b>Essence Emeralds and a Self-buff Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, there's a discussion at necro.eqclasses.com in regards to the use of essence emeralds (primarily about why they aren't used and what could be done to fix them). It would certainly honor us necromancers if you would take a look or reply to the email that Qque sent you. <br><br>I would also like to add to what Qque said in that instead of making a new item (Emeralds w/ charges) you could ask Lawrence to see if it's feasible to make sacrifice create multiple gems while still requiring the original emerald reagent. This would certainly make casting spells like sacrifice more palatable and, while it won't compete with clerics, it will make necromancers a little less sketchy about casting other spells. I for one, would never use Trucidation or Infusion with the current requirement, especially since Infusion is not targetable. <br><br>Also, if you would, ask Lawrence why I can't cast Manaskin and/or Shield of the Magi (both self-only spells) if I have a lower-level character targetted (one whom I would be unable to buff with a 50+ spell, assuming that I had any 50+ buffs). There's a message displayed stating that the target is too low level for me to cast my self-buff. Thanks in advance. <br><br>Kilamon K'Lmal, Tunare server. ]</i></font><br><br>We've already discussed Essence Emeralds, actually. We don't have any plans to change the way they work or the spells that use them. We want those spells to be rarely used and difficult to gather components for. We want them to be cast rarely and with good reason. We think the spells and the Essence Emeralds are right where we want them. <br><br>There is a bug that I'm aware of on Sullon that we are working on that is similar to what you describe, but I wasn't aware of it on any Live servers. I'll mention it to the folks working on the fix for Sullon and see if they can expand it to the Live servers. <br><br>Thanks<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000225.html"><b>Monster Illusion</b></a><br>A mysterious unsigned note: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: OK mages get monster summon because they are the masters of summoning. Enchanters are masters of illusion why dont they get monster illusion? It would be the same as monster summons except they become the monster , being choosen randomly. Something that would even out the illusion would make gaurds or other protecting NPC attack you while in monster illusion (I.E. you turn into a rat in FP and go next to a gaurd the gaurd will attack you) And there could be different kinds of monster ones as Minor monster illusion , monster illusion, and major monster illusion. Minor: rats, orc pawns and other small monsters. Regular monster illusion would be orcs , dervs, and others. Major would be giants, griffans, and so on. BTW what about a sex change illusion just for fun. ]</i></font><br><br>I remember covering this once, but that might have been on the old boards. <br><br>The reason for not allowing this is, primarily, about faction and body type. Turning into a minotaur, for example, would allow you freedom to explore a lot of places without fear of attack by other minotaurs. Turn into a goblin and goblins will be likely to give you too much freedom in their homes. <br><br>This isn't so much of a problem with pets, because the master of the pet isn't masked by the pet, even though the pet might have some added freedom of movement.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000223.html"><b>Interrupting Spells</b></a><br>BerzerkerBen wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Under 'Magic changes in Test server' I read once you duck your spell gets interrupted immediately. Is this true? Can this be true? please say yes!!!! many of my friends have died after I accidentally clicked on the complete heal spell... Say this is true and will go live please!!! ]</i></font><br><br>This is true on Test at the moment. Whether or not is will remain that way until we patch next is uncertain. Right now, the plan is to leave it this way, but that plan could change so don't get too excited. <br><br>The main reason for this change is to fix an 'exploit'. We are fully aware of the beneficial side of this change, and as of our last meeting we are inclined to keep that beneficial side as it is.</UL>

It is also not hard to have to click on food to eat it and it is not hard to have to hit the "run" button everytime you started an EQ session. Why are these things not part of the game? It is because they are tedious. It is tedious to have to ask for a mana check and it is tedious to report it. <br><br>When I hear you say it is not hard to report mana, I hear Abashi when he was asked why the "run" button cannot be pressed by default. (this was a while ago) He said something along the lines of "how hard can it be to hit one button when you start the game? (not an exact quote) I beleive this attitude was one of his major flaws as an internet communications representative. When someone asks for something to make the game less tedious, I beleive it should be examined without your own personal bias as to whether or not it is "necessary". <br><br>There are many things that are not in the game because they are tedious. I beleive this should be examined as one of those things. If you want to tell me it is not going to be imnplemented for technical reasons, that is fine; but please, look at it without your own personal bias as to whether or not you feel it is necessary. <br><br>I hope I didn't cause any hard feelings with this reply. Hopefully we can still be buds after you're done reading this. I'll buy you one of your favorite drink at any tavern of your choice, as long as it is in Kaladim. :)<br><br>Whim<br>Emarr]</i></font> <br><br>In keeping with my promise, I'm moving this topic to its own thread. Hook into this thread: <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000195.htm">http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000195.htm</a>> for more details. You'll have to wade a bit, it's not a one topic thread&#8230; :)<br><br>There is, and always will be, a fine line between tedious and fiction-breaking. Personally, I'm still against the idea that people spend their whole lives running in Norrath, and I don't like the idea that you can have running on when you log in, and yet right now you can't set a default language in the same way&#8230; It makes more sense to me for your character to 'wake up' walking rather than running, and for trolls to 'wake up' talking in trollish rather than common. <br><br>If it helps, I will never set my default to run when I enter the world. <br><br>But those are my opinions (and, I think, ones that I'll express to the team in a quick e-mail, now that you've got me thinking about it again&#8230; :)). <br><br>What players have been asking for (for those of you just tuning in) is the ability to use a %m in macros that would report their percentage of remaining mana. We've said that we don't intend to do that. The reason is basically two-fold. The primary reason is that people living in the world of Norrath don't use phrases like "Hail, %t. I am ready for the next pull, as my mana is at %m." The secondary is, well, we like the vague nature of the mana bar. We don't show the numbers, and that leaves us disinclined to show percentages either. <br><br>I hope that I have been clear with everyone with the differences between my personal opinions (which may or may not match those of the company or the players, and doesn't need to) and the opinions of the Development Team that I represent. I always try to make certain that I am clear when telling you what I think and what we are doing and why. <br><br>Right now, we don't plan to add a feature for reporting mana in any form. The difference in the level of 'tedium' between typing "/g 60" and hitting a macro is relatively minor. And we think that things are better as they are. <br><br>That doesn't mean we aren't willing to listed to discussion on the matter. But that is the decision we came to at the last Tuning meeting when this idea was brought up. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Comment on Casters Mana... <br><br>All Casters have their Own strategy. Some like to keep 20-30% for Emergency's, or for critical situation... I for one like to tell my group I have less than I really have, so that encounters are a bit safer... why ? Cause I've had groups pulling 2-3 mobs with me at 50%... which turned disastrous. So to compensate, I will say lower and hope that if they pull this off again... The difference will save the group. <br><br>Well, if everyone in the Group could see your mana bar... You would have those telling you how to use your magic, and when to use it... and some telling you you're a morron for using it and not leaving mana for emergency's and so on.... <br><br>So, in my opinion... I don't have a problem telling my group how much mana I have...

This isn't because we advocate lying to your party about your mana&#8230; in fact I'd suggest that your better off educating them about why you do what you do than keeping them in the dark. <br><br>We don't plan to do it because we just don't see mana level as something that people would be able to determine by glancing at you during a fight.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000220.html"><b>Sit</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: All I keep asking is will my doggie sit when I'm in wolf form in Luclin ?<br>Just a "yes"/"no"/"we're thinking about it" would be nice. <br><br>Mell ]</i></font><br><br>Maybe&#8230; <br><br>This is something that we want to add, along with a ton of other neato ideas.

BTW this change happened back before there was so much whining and complaining and also predates any expansion. ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, it happened during beta. The reason for it is pretty simple. Most of the models that you turn into using minor illusion (maybe all of them) were built to be stationary. They don't have any animations, and they used to cause people to get stuck all over the place when you could move. They would sometimes cause people to fall under the world too. There wasn't any way to fix it so that all of the beds and barrels in Norrath were able to function while animated, so the best solution was to prevent people from moving with the spell.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000222.html"><b>Gloves of Fire</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings gentlemen there. <br><br>My problem: Gloves of Fire (some stats, effect, no drop, mag/wiz) that *censored* drops in *censored*.<br>If you put these gloves on HIE or GNM they are awesome looking. The colour is bright , even neon red. _The_ best looking gloves in the game.<br>I was so thrilled when I got a pair of these. And I was sorely disappointed when I put them on. They have a reddish, quite dark brown colour when they are on Dark elf hands. :(<br><br>Why is this? Why do they look so godly on other races and on dark elf they look like you had been grovelling in mud a moment ago? Is there any way to get them look on DEF the same as they look on HIE? Is this a bug or just a bad feature because of some shading in graphics or such? <br><br>I know, there is a plethora of more important things in the game yes. This one just happened to affect me much. I was looking forward to them and I have red dress and those 2 glowing red globes and the neon red fiery gloves would have been exellent for my outlook. Now it's not so. Please (on my knees) could you ask quickly about this from the graphics guy? Is there any way to get these gloves look like they should on Dark Elfs? <br><br>You know the saying (CP 2.0.2.0): Style before everything. <br><br>Thank you for your time and keep up the good work there. <br><br>Sincerely<br>*******************<br>Dthamilaye K'Tang, 54th magician in Tunare <br><br>PS. I wouldn't say no if You could give us mages the improved invis too :)]</i></font><br><br>The answer is a little complicated. <br><br>Each race has a look, a texture, to their armor pieces. When tinting a piece of armor that tinting is, basically, placed on top of that texture (blended with it, sorta). So the actual color of the armor after the tinting won't be uniform for each race that wears it. This is, really, a good thing, adding variety to the armors that we create. But it also means that there is no way to get a uniform look across all the races. <br><br>And, well, sorry about the Improved Invisibility thing. You get advantages, and you get disadvantages. Not having Improved Invisibility is one of the disadvantages.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000216.html"><b>Magic Concerns</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I just have one concern. Will the NPC's be getting the anti-gate spells? <br><br>Thuldorn ]</i></font><br><br>No, NPCs will not be getting this spell (and not so much because we don't want them to, but more for technical reasons). And, no, these spells will not work on player characters in PvP either, for the same technical reasons. <br><br>Because of the fact that the spell would be a problem to code to work on player characters, we've never needed to discuss whether or not we want it to work on player characters&#8230; I think it would be fun, but that's just me. :)</UL>

For your reading pleasure we bring you today's installment to the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>More Sullon Zek Talk</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: BUG: When dueling someone outside your PvP range, you cannot loot their corpse. <br><br>Joyous<br>SZ<br>Anarchy ]</i></font><br><br>Why would that seem like a bug to you? <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: please apologize my poor english <br><br>Was wondering is the enchanteur class was not going to be the main looser in this server :<br>1) it seems that generally, enchanters get hard time in PVP mainly because of high MR at higher levels. This partly stems from intense item trading (which does not appear to be discouraged in the new server).<br>2) they cannot be agnostic anymore....spell collection & quest (not to mention daylife) will be greatly hindered)<br>3) as people now con ally or threatening, illusions wont be as effective as they were before on other PVP servers<br>4) their jewels are more and more outfashionned by items to be looted in velious (not a secific problem of this server though)<br>5)enchanters are the sole caster that cannot either sow or shadowstep or let a good pet intercepting in case of sudden attack. this increase the consequences of point 3) <br><br>I dont know if this is feasible but.....a mere "agnostic" enchantment could solve part of these problems (2&3 as above reffered). This spell would let them appearing as being agnostic for a while (suppressing the religious factor and not theatenning to another human player). Nothing against having this spell being broken when attacking as invisibility does. ]</i></font><br><br>Yes, it will probably be a little harder to be an enchanter on Sullon than on other PvP servers. <br><br>1) We've addressed that already by increasing the debuffs to 1.5 times their effectiveness on player characters.<br>2) This will indeed make things harder for enchanters. However, they will still have a bit of a lock on jewelcraft, and I suspect that deals will be made&#8230;<br>3) Not really comparable. On the team servers you can distinguish someone by the color of their name, and illusions do cover that. But on Sullon there are no colored names to cover, and your race does not always determine your team. An evil enchanter illusioned as a human will appear the same to anyone as any other evil human&#8230;<br>4) Unrelated to PvP or Sullon&#8230;<br>5) This won't be any better or worse on Sullon than on any other PvP server. <br><br>Appearing as agnostic would be worse than appearing as the team you are on. Agnostics would be a forth team, if anything, and not on all teams. We might talk about a spell for suppressing religion, but such a spell would probably be way too powerful on Sullon. <br><br>Adesina wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to what you have said, beneficial spells only work w/in a certain level range of the caster. Is this true for bind affinity? I personally think that is one spell that anyone (anyone who can, that is) should be able to cast on any team member who needs it. There is really no logical reason to have the level gap apply to this spell as well, since the level of the caster doesn't effect the actual bind in any way. Just curious. Thanks :)]</i></font><br><br>Not a problem. The system is set up so that spells won't work on anyone twenty levels below the level of the spell. So it won't be a problem for any spell under 20th level, such as Bind Affinity. <br><br>Rubikoob wrote:<br> <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've given it some thought, and I think you are probably right. The majority of players will most likely decide first on a team and then on a class, or vice versa, relegating their selection of race and deity to whatever options are then left to them. <br><br>*musing* <br><br>I've also been considering the issue of team balance... and while there is merit to the idea of having an actual imbalance in the way teams are set up in order to establish a sort of "underdog" mentality in order to give more of an identity to the different teams, I think it would be better to have the system show no favorites and allow the players themselves to determine such traits. As it is now, Grobb and Oggok are a veritable stronghold of evil, separated by several zones from the nearest non-evil city, Freeport, which can hardly be considered unified against evil anyway. Grobb and Oggok sit right next to several of the most popular zones in the game... Oasis and Guk, with Cazic-Thule thrown in there as a nice upper-20's low-30's sort of dungeon. <br><br>Neutrals don't have quite as much of a consolidated stronghold, but they do have sole ownership of Kaladim as well as the potential for a very strong presence in Greater Faydark and Ak'Anon. In fact, the entire continent of Faydwer could potentially belong to neutrality. <br><br>The closest thing to a 'stronghold' that the good team has is Felwithe, stuck right in the middle of a continent teetering towards neutrality. It will be an uphill battle for them to establish and maintain a strong presence in Greater Faydark, and the neutrals won't give it up without a fight. Goodies really just don't have anywhere to call home, and I think they should. <br><br>Sorry for the length of this post, but thanks for still reading it if you got this far. <br><br>By the way, you craftily dodged my question regarding where the Vah Shir are going to fit into all of this. I think it's already been said that they are more or less a 'good' race, but do you think we could get any further comment, specifically regarding the Deity Wars server? <br><br>/musing ]</i></font><br><br>We've gone over this a LOT here. There really is no way to make the teams that works better than what we've got. We're also fairly certain that things will level out more as the server ages, but that's not something we'll have to wait on to see how it goes. <br><br>As for the Vah Shir question, I wasn't so much dodging as I was just not answering. No matter what decision we might make now (and we really haven't), we'd have to re-evaluate it later anyway to reflect the reality of the server after it's been up a while. So you we aren't really worrying about what team to put them on for a while yet. Though, as many have speculated, I imagine that they won't be on the evil team. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Choices in EverQuest: Roleplaying, Religion and More</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've learned to like the challenge of conformity. Without a GM actively making the lives of non-conformists (outcasts) difficult, it is too easy to play one. There are no behavior restrictions other than the ones the player chooses. No standards for others to base expectations on. Do whatever one wants and it's "roleplaying" an "outcast". <br><br>One of EQ's strengths is the diversity of archetypes to choose from. There is enough leeway within each basic race/class choice to personalize a PC. If a player has a specific role they want to play there is an archetype available. If a player has a specific race/class they want to play, then the challenge is to adapt a role that suits that choice. <br><br>My personal nature is such that I am inclined to help others in need (most of the time :)). In Norrathian terms "good" or "light". It's no stretch for me to roleplay a woodelf ranger. The challenge is to be _my_ woodelf ranger, and give him a personality beyond the archetype. With the release of Kunark the Iksar's caught my attention. I attempted to play an 'independent adventurer' not subject to the bias of his race/class (necro). Very easy for me to play. No real change from my woodelf ranger. This was not within the archetype's character. I felt something was missing from my roleplay experience, but it took a more skilled roleplayer to point the following out: <br><br>There was no challenge to play my assumed role. By removing my PC's behavioral boundaries I had also removed my characters depth. To act out a part one needs a stage, a scene, and/or other actors. By ignoring my character's pre-determined background, I ignored his setting. My PC's audience had no point of reference (they couldn't read my mind to learn my elaborate and contrived background). My performance couldn't be judged on it's believability. There was no way to determine if I was roleplaying, or just playing. <br><br>-=Reptanis ]</i></font><br><br>Wow. Well written. Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Without those consequences (making it hard to accomplish won't be a consequence, once you've done that, then things will be smooth sailing) you're unique Drizzt will be one of many Drizzts <br><br>So what? <br><br>See, this is just what I was talking about. You don't understand, and I can't seem to make you understand, and it's frustrating. But you have the inside track to making sure your status quo is maintained, while all I can do is sit out here and beat my head against the wall in frustration. :(<br><br>I'm not looking to be different from other players. I don't give a rat's backside about what the other players do. I'm looking to be different from the the starting fiction. If everybody else wants to do the same thing, that's fine with me. Let them. How is the game hurt by having a bunch of Drizzt clones running around? How is having a bunch of Drizzt clones on a blue server any different from the friendly Dark Elf Necros and Troll Shamans and Ogre Shadow Knights that are already on the blue servers? <br><br>There is no real way to roleplay an evil race/class on a blue server. Trolls threaten to eat my gnome warriorette, and she just runs up and hugs their knees. Why? Because it's a blue server and I know that no matter how tough they talk, and no matter how much they bluster and threaten, they can't do a thing to me. They can't REALLY be evil on a blue server. The best they can hope for is to get into an all-evil guild and minimize the amount of grouping they do with non-evils. <br><br>So since there's no way to REALLY be evil on a blue server, what's the difference between the friendly, chatty dark elf necros who exist by the dozens on any blue server and a friendly, chatty dark elf ranger who might (or might not) exist by the dozens if we had fewer racial class restrictions? These necros aren't paragons of evil magic and nefarious intent. They're personable, fun, helpful, and so on. If some of them were Rangers instead of Necros, so what? It wouldn't hurt anybody, and it would be a lot of fun for the player. And isn't that what this game is all about? Fun? <br><br>Ruatha Kneeslasher [Wings of Honor]<br>48th Level Gnome Warriorette<br>WARNING! I am a professional gnome, using special gnome equipment on an enclosed stunt server. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! ]</i></font><br><br>Well, I do have the advantage when it comes to making changes to the existing game, as does anyone arguing for the status quo. But at the core my concern isn't just for the world of Norrath. We can take this discussion to levels abstract and I'll have the same opinion (and I'll be just as stubborn about it). <br><br>I can't find any further arguments that might persuade you that a herd of Drizzts is bad for any game, so I will cease trying. <br><br>As for your point about not being able to be 'evil' on a standard server, I agree with you. But, well, that's a point unrelated to the discussion about too many out of type characters harming a game. We could certainly spin off into a discussion about how to be evil on a non-PvP server and how PvP relates to roleplaying, but that would probably be too far off topic here. <br><br>The only point I have left is this. Yes, playing Drizzt_56 might be fun for you and the other 55 Drizzts on the server. But I can tell you that it would indeed make the game less fun for me, and I can find 55 other people that agree with me pretty easily. <br><br>That doesn't mean that you're wrong for finding that fun. But I'm not wrong either. And I (I believe) have the strength of the integrity of the world's fiction to sway the argument in my favor. <br><br>Sir_Yakk wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: So, make the 'difficult' quest mentioned easier a cake walk. <br><br>Require L 60.

But, I think Norrath would be a better place with them in it. ]</i></font><br><br>Ah! <br><br>I AM a big fan of some sort of reincarnation for characters. Something that comes at the end of the character career and at the expense of the identity of the character. If such a change is allowed before the player has had much time to develop the character's personality, then the intervening levels just become a barrier to fun, and why not just allow those choices from the beginning. <br><br>If the barrier was so great that only one Drizzt would appear on a server every few months or years, then I'd be all for it. Those characters would indeed be unique, and would not appear with such frequency as to make the evil dark elves a minority. <br><br>BUT, well, tacking such a thing on to EverQuest now would be a nightmare. <br><br>I do agree though, that a Norrath with a rare unique character would be a better place. In a way that is the reason that lotteries are so popular. Not because you know anyone that has actually won, but because the winners that you've heard of across the country are people that you can hope to be one day. Such is the power of legend and myth, and on such things are games like EverQuest built.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000202.html"><b>Spells and Vendors</b></a><br>BigBurp_AFK wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I happened to be in EC yesterday so I picked up this spell (I'm a troll shaman) so that I would have it when the patch goes live.

I even remind the GM before most games about that particular quirk, and he still forgets to use it against me&#8230; <br><br>RedHairBear wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I think the comment regarding emotes showing up in a character's native language is rather silly, to be honest. <br><br>An emote is a physical action, such as waving, hugging, crying, etc. These actions, as a general rule, cross racial barriers, and don't generally need a dictionary in order to translate what they mean. <br><br>In the real world, if I'm in France, and I see a Parisian woman crying, I don't need to speak French to tell she's upset about something.

The answer to all those questions is no. The reduction in spell damage against player characters was a necessary change for PvP in EverQuest, and won't be going away as far as I can tell. And fear is not only too powerful in PvP, but it can cause a character to lose experience out of range on Sullon Zek. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan: <br><br>This thread (Where is the feedback) is the opposite of good.

We've replaced them with ogres and things run much faster now. And, well, the senior management here are not insane gnomes. Several are berserker barbarians, that's for sure.

For instance, How is it I can 'hear' what my guild says across all the coninents? Why does my character come back after death? etc. etc. etc. The answer is simply to improve gameplay. Roleplaying wise you can simply use the old Dungeon Master's war cry "Its Magic!" <br><br>We are talking about improving communication and ease of use of the game.

Gordon Wrinn fired off a new update on the Developer's Board tackling PvP issues that are being "misinterpreted" by other sites.  Here's the complete post:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>It&#8217;s apparent that as a result of the Fan Faire this weekend in Minneapolis, inaccurate information regarding our PvP plans for the future were released and/or misinterpreted. <br><br>That has always been one of the difficulties of having a real-time interactive discussion where one doesn&#8217;t have the time to think about the precise wording of their answers. However, what we gain through the interactive forum makes it worth the effort, even when things appear to come out wrong like they did in the PvP panel this weekend. <br><br>For the most part, regarding the information that has since shown up on web sites, it appears that when it was mentioned that we &#8220;discussed&#8221; an issue, it was interpreted as &#8220;we are doing this&#8221;. The fact is, we discuss a TON of things when we&#8217;re driven to improve one area of the game. If you name it, we&#8217;ve probably discussed it at one time or another. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that what we discussed has either been decided or shot down, just that we&#8217;ve given it some measure of consideration in the past. <br><br>So, with that in mind, here&#8217;s the quote-by-quote clarification of the story on Castersrealm (eq.castersrealm.com) and RallosZek.net. (www.ralloszek.net). <br><br>Quote from Article: In approximately one week, PvP 'rules' will be as on Sullon Zek. In other words, there are no rules with respect to PvP. Standard blue server rules apply and sexual/racial harassment will not be tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point camping/exp killing, etc) will be completely legal. No PvP related petitions will be handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems such as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled.<br><br>Clarification: Sure, we discussed it, much like we discuss anything. As we were putting together the ruleset for Sullon Zek, someone suggested that we role it out across Sullon first and see how that goes and role it across the other servers if it works out. Will it go across the other servers? We don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll have to see how it goes on Sullon first.<br><br>Quote From Article: ShowEQ is actively being pursued to be 'fixed' <br><br>Clarification: As actively as &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; allows. We really need to do something revolutionary and complex in our next attempt to address the problem. It&#8217;s just a matter of having enough time to implement and test that. Timeframe? Mid-term, probably prior to Luclin&#8217;s launch.<br><br>Quote from Article: Classes are being re-examined for viability in a PvP environment. Lady Daegarmo specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that is woeful in PvP.<br><br>Clarification: &#8230;with nothing specific planned and nothing beyond minor tweaks, certainly nothing class-redefining planned. Regarding rangers there was talk about improving archery, but that was spoken of with plans to put something out across all servers rather than just as a PvP-related improvement. The truth is, the classes are not balanced for one-on-one PvP, no more than they are balanced for one-on-one PvE (Player versus Environment). If you have to fight as part of a group to be successful in PvE, you&#8217;ll most likely have to do so with PvP. Yes, this does mean that a solo melee player will be at a disadvantage when meeting casters, especially those configured for solo play, and yes, that is part of the plan.<br><br>Quote from the Article: Lady Daegarmo is pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for approx 200P each<br><br>Clarification: Oh it&#8217;s been pushed, but has yet not been taken up by the dev team for consideration. We&#8217;re kind of like the supreme court that way :)<br><br>Quote from Article: It was noted that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell function with opposite effects so there's no way to give Lay Hands back to paladins on death while restricting the same recycle on HT<br><br>Clarification: Not entirely accurate. The reuse time is not tied to the spell effect, not to mention that each ability is treated as a skill by the game and uses its own reuse timer. The reason it&#8217;s not being done is not a matter of technical unfeasibility, but rather a specific design decision not to. Both are easy to exploit. The level to which they can be exploited is acceptable on the PvE servers and not acceptable on the PvP servers. <br><br>Quote from Article: Cross teaming is coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be locked down. There will be no ability to crossteam at all. No grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with non-team members. This lockdown is probably 60 days out. (I stated that the Development team would make an official date on the lock down in which they would give a minimal of 30 day notice. I also stated that I doubted you would see these changes within the next 2 months.)<br><br>Clarification: Yep, we&#8217;re planning on addressing cross-teaming, probably through locking down the teams. However, the specifics on how this will be done, along with what if any beneficial abilities will be allowed to cross any lock down is still being discussed. Opinions are welcome.<br><br>Quote from Article: The lockdown will entail a guildwipe. All guilds will be deleted and must be reformed. There will be extra staff for the first few days after the wipe to assist in this endeavour<br><br>Clarification: If we decided to do the most severe lockdown (no cross-guilding), then this would probably be the case. However something like this won&#8217;t be decided until we decide what kind of lockdown we&#8217;ll do.<br><br>Quote from Article: It is highly likely that common (the language) will be removed from the racewar servers for general communication use (i.e., public channels). Training in non-team languages will also receive very low caps.<br><br>Clarification: No. While this was one of the many thing suggested as part of a panel discussion, it has only been discussed as one of the many possible options for an &#8220;RP Server&#8221;, for lack of a better term, by the development team. The &#8220;RP Server&#8221;, by the way, will not be PvP. Those looking for PvP rules similar to an &#8220;RP Server&#8221; should look towards Sullon Zek.<br><br>Quote from Article: Strong possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change your team. Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain teams (such as a Paladin joining the evil team).<br><br>Clarification: No. It was one of the suggestions brought up by players in the panel discussion, and has not been discussed by the development team. However, I can say with some certainty that this probably won&#8217;t happen.<br><br>Quote from Article: TZ likely to be changed to a 2 team server (Good vs. Evil). VZ may be changed to a 3 team server<br><br>Clarification: These were &#8216;off the cuff&#8217; examples of how a lock down could possibly be accomplished, rather than an indication of the direction planned. To clarify further, we previously decided not to implement a 2-team system, and are considering a 3 team system, by race, due to the percentage breakdown of players on each team currently.<br><br>Quote from Article: Rallos will always remain coin + 1 item loot. Code for rain spells is currently being changed to not effect your pet or your immediate group<br><br>Clarification: Yep and Yep, but no ETA.<br><br>Quote from Article: Sullon Zek will be live within 3 weeks<br><br>Clarification: Probably within a week actually baring major problems coming up.<br><br>Quote from Article: There's discussion about adding a new Guildwar server with no 'teams' but lockdowns based on your guild.<br><br>Clarification: This was previously discussed and ruled out by the development team, as it would be insufficiently differentiated from the current servers. In other words, most of everything that would be doable on the &#8220;guildwar&#8221; server is currently doable on Rallos, or one of the existing teams for that matter. <br><br>Quote from Article: On Sullon, the new summon corpse mechanism for good races will be obtained via a quest which likely involves PvP/crests of fallen opponents.<br><br>Clarification: This is accurate. In fact I&#8217;ll tell you now that Mages are in line to gain the ability on Sullon. And no, we won&#8217;t roll it out that way on other servers :)<br><br>I hope this gives everyone a better idea of what we have planned for the near and mid-terms. We&#8217;ll work to be a little more explicit about what is currently planned or not planned to avoid misunderstandings in the future.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer, EQLive/Luclin<br>Sony Online Entertainment</UL>Click here to visit the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000217.html">original thread</a>.

Here's what Alan wrote on the Developer's Corner today in response to the feedback generated by players:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar and Religion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Since the discussion of the definition of 'agnostic' in relation to Norrath has come up, I thought I might as well through in my 2 copper pieces. I think 'agnostic' in a Norrathing sense means 'not choosing to worship a god over the others', it is basically impossible to deny or even be unsure of the existence of gods in Norrath, so being agnostic would be the equivalent of 'sitting on the fence' of worhsip. That is, an agnostic character might pray to Tunare when hoping for a good harvest, Rodcet Nife when a family member or friend is sick, or Rallos Zek when his/her people are going to war, etc etc. Personally I think that the vast majority of Norrath would be agnostic (in that sense), but thats just me, prejudiced by my encounters with fantasy and historic religion. Excuse the ramblings. ;o) <br><br>-Mistyn<br>Virtuoso of Luclin ]</i></font><br><br>Rambling is a good thing. :)<br><br>That's as good a definition of agnostic in Norrath as any. The point I wanted to make was that it doesn't (can't) mean the same thing in Norrath that it does for us. And getting hung up on the real life meaning of the word isn't really necessary, and it's not useful to your roleplaying experience. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor,<br>But...what if the world didn't have to change at all? I mean, I believe what the person was intending on doing was EARNING the right to become a bard. By this he wasn't saying throw new guild leaders in each and every single city (I'm not sure if this what you were leaning towards or away from), but instead imagine his DE hunting orcs until 15 so he could at least get into FP to try and prove his worthiness to the guild leader. It's an excellent idea...what if you were to throw a NPC that you could turn your PVP book into (Tomb of Order and Discord) that would grant you the option of becoming an outcast from your city? Think about it...your a High Elf that would love nothing more than to be able to sneak around and steal. You turn your book in to the new NPC and he/she says "You wish to follow your own trail then 'eh? Very well Absor...may Tunare have mercy on your soul...". The NPC kills you, and you respawn outside the city gates. When you try to move near the city guards, their weapons are pointed towards you now...you're an outcast and not wanted here anymore. Get the idea? I'm not quite sure how much coding it would take, or even if it's possible...but I figured it was worth a shot. <br><br>-Tang- ]</i></font><br><br>I understand the idea. And it sounds like a nice one. But it forgets one thing. <br><br>Give people the chance to become a dark elven ranger, and a large portion of the player base will do just that. How much sense would it make if 20% of the dark elven people were rangers? 20% of Norrath's nastiest people are tree-huggers? <br><br>This sort of dovetails into this next comment. It's LONG. I kind of regret my policy of not editing peoples comments&#8230; :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor: <br><br>I know this is a long post, but I RILLY RILLY hope you'll read it. This is something that's very important to me and something about which I feel very strongly. <br><br>About the subject of removing racial class restrictions, you said: <br><br>"The difference between your idea of no holds barred <br>roleplaying and what I feel is roleplaying are very <br>strong. "<br><br>Oh dear. I can tell I'm not going to like the rest of your post. <br><br>Ruatha reads the rest of your post <br><br>Yep, I was right. I didn't like it. <br>*sigh* <br><br>It's always frustrating to me to try and discuss this topic because it's just so obvious to me how much more fun the game would be if there were less (or no) class restrictions based on race. This isn't to say that I'm right and you're wrong and neener neener neener if you don't like it. Not at all. The rational, reasonable part of my brane tells me "Now now, Ru, not everybody sees the world the way you see the world. And remember: reasonable people with good intentions can still disagree on important issues." And I understand that this is an issue where there really isn't a "wrong" answer. <br><br>But... <br><br>On some level, it's just so blindingly obvious to me -- so fundamentally self evident -- that the game could and would be so much more fun with fewer racial class restrictions (or no racial class restrictions at all), that I have a hard time explaining it. It's like if someone said "Why shouldn't I burn off this dog's tail with a blowtorch?" I wouldn't be able to explain logically and rationally why they shouldn't do it. All I'd be able to do would be to splutter and say "Well, it's just *WRONG* to do that!" <br><br>So there's this other part of my brane -- the old lizard hindbrane bits -- that makes me just wanna grab people who advocate restrictive class options due to "fiction" and shake them briskly and yell "WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!? WHY CAN'T I MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH MORE *FUN* THE GAME WOULD BE IF I COULD BE AN OGRE BARD OR AN ERUDITE WARRIOR?!?" <br><br>(Actually, since I'm a gnome, I'd probably grab them and just shake myself back and forth briskly while they remained motionless. Ah, the perils of being the proper size while surrounded by all you giants... [biggrin]) <br><br>Having said all of that, I'll try to explain why I feel the way I feel... <br><br>Like many (perhaps most) of the people who play EQ, I have an extensive background in reading Science Fiction and Fantasy books. I grew up reading authors like Asimov and Heinlein. As I got older, I started reading more fantasy and less SF. These days, I'm much more likely to read some cheesy Forgotten Realms book than I am to read Science Fiction. What can I say? I just like the swords and sorcery Fantasy setting. <br><br>But the characters that have always held the most interest for me were those characters that were "different." Characters that didn't adhere to standard Sword-n-Sorcery conventions. I think the first character like this I ever ran across was Elric, from the Moorcock books. <br><br>Elric was the antithesis of the typical sword-n-sorcery hero, particularly of heroes like Conan and Fahfrd. The typical Sword-n-Sorcery hero was big, strong, and physically powerful. They were often uncivilized (both Conan and Fahfrd were barbarians). They had no little (if any) tolerance for the arcane arts. And they were very clearly Good Guys(tm). <br><br>Elric was physically frail, to the point where, before he got Stormbringer, he required drugs to survive. He embraced civilization and longed for its trappings when he was away. He used Sorcery to further his own goals. And he was not always a Good Guy(tm). <br><br>And not only was Elric a departure from scores of fantasy heroes which preceded him, but he was also a rebel among his own kind. He disliked the decadence into which his own race had fallen, and was responsible for leading the sacking of his own hometown. This (among other things) is how he earned the nickname "Kinslayer." <br><br>But Elric was just the first. He's been followed by a string of other characters, heroes and anti-heroes (and occasionally villains) who were interesting because they didn't fit into pre-existing notions of how they should behave. Probably the most well-known of these characters are Drizzt Do'Urden, the Dark Elf Ranger from the R.A. Salvatore books and Dragonbait, the Lizardman Paladin from the "Azure Bonds" books by Jeff Grubb. And there are dozens of others. <br><br>And I'm pretty sure that I'm not the only one who finds these characters much more interesting than their mundane counterparts. Any Human can be a Ranger. But a *Dark Elf*? Why would a Dark Elf be a Ranger? Why isn't he Evil like the rest of his kind? What drove him away from the underground and towards the light? Where did he learn his Ranger skills? The story behind these questions is much more interesting (to me, and to lots of other people) than the story behind why J. Random Human became a Ranger. <br><br>This interest in non-standard, convention-breaking characters has followed me all through my RPG career (spanning over 20 years now). I have always played a non-standard character in all of my RPGs. I was the player who was always pestering the GM to let me bend (or break) the racial class restrictions a tad so I could play something fun and unique. My favorite AD&D character was an Orc Warrior that my GM allowed me to run. <br><br>Even within EverQuest, I have always played non-standard characters. The reason I picked a Gnome Warrior is because they're different. I also have an Ogre Warrior who was raised by Erudites. He wears glasses, and speaks with a cultured, sophisticated accent -- right up until he goes Berzerk, at which point he degenerates into traditional Ogrespeak and starts yelling "THROG SMASH! THROG KILL! GRAAAR!" (He keeps talking like this until the Berzerk wears off, at which point he apologizes to his group and becomes painfully embarassed about his behavior.) I once started a Human Wizard and dumped 15 points into STR and 15 points into STA and claimed that his mother was a Barbarian, and he'd inherited his physical (and mental) traits from his mother's side. But his father had been a Wizard. And his grandfather had been a Wizard. And his great-grandfather had been a Wizard. So he was determined to be a Wizard as well, even though he was much more suited to the life of a Melee class. <br><br>And so on, and so forth, etc. I have always had an interest in playing non-standard characters, because standard characters are...well...standard. And to me, "standard" equals "boring." <br><br>To this, you say: <br><br>"Roleplaying requires a setting. You can't roleplay <br>characters without a universe for them to exist in. <br>Characters, therefore, should be a logical outcome of <br>living in that world (and of course that world needs <br>to make sense). Iksar paladins don't fit into the world <br>of Norrath. Iksar have been isolated for a very long <br>time. They have only one god, and he certainly doesn't <br>support the idea of paladins. That is a function of the <br>nature of iksar, as they exist on Norrath. It's part of <br>the world. Creating a character that is explicitly <br>contrary to that world isn't roleplaying. "<br><br>Allow me to point out two things. <br><br>1) Verant defines the fiction. If Verant had created the Iksar race and said "There is a heretical sect of good-aligned Iksars hidden within a secret camp in the Field of Bone. Iksars who follow this sect can be Paladins." then *voila*, that's the fiction. That's what they did with Erudites. Erudites are noble and good -- except for those Heretics in Paineel. So you can't really justify your argument with "Well, that's not fiction." You work for the company that creates the fiction, and they can define any fiction they choose if it suits their needs. <br><br>2) Having said that, yes, I agree that setting is important. And, for better or for worse, Verant has set the initial fiction in stone. Iksars can't start off as Paladins. Ogres can't start off as Bards. Erudites can't start off as Warriors. And I agree that it would be kinda silly to have completely unrestricted race/class combinations at character creation. I mean, I just can't see an Ogre Paladin guild in Oggok. <br><br>But. <br><br>People (and Iksars, and Ogres, and Erudites) can change, if they want. Who's to say that an Ogre Warrior, travelling outside of Oggok for the first time, might not run across a bard in the Feerrott, and be entranced by the songs of the bard, to the point where he becomes determined to be a bard himself? Who's to say that an Erudite, after visiting Qeynos for the first time, becomes filled with visions of martial glory after visiting the Grounds of Fate, and becomes determined to be a Warrior? <br><br>So for me, I'm not irked by the fact that my beginning class selection is racially restricted. But I do think there should be a way to change to a different class via a quest. <br><br>Before you start shaking your head and saying "No no no, out of the question," hear me out. I have what I think is a perfectly workable (in the sense of "won't unbalance the game and won't break fiction") idea to allow in-game class changes. <br><br>1) For every class in the game, create at least one avenue where anyone of any race/class/deity combo raise faction with a guild of that class. It doesn't necessarily have to be an exciting or easy way to raise faction. Maybe it's tedious and boring. And make it so where it doesn't raise faction with anybody else but the guild in question. <br><br>2) Create an NPC that gives out a "change of class" quest for that guild. The quest should be challenging on the order of the Crafted Armor quests. <br><br>2a) Make it so where you can't switch classes if your race could have been that class from the beginning. So if you're a human, you can't switch to any class but Shaman (since humans can be every other class). <br><br>3) Require the player character to be at least 20th level and have "Ally" level faction before the NPC gives out the "change of class" quest. <br><br>4) Once the character completes the quest, the character undergoes a ceremony which transforms him/her into a 1st level character of the desired class -- with the same stats as a 1st level character of the desired class. All those weapon skills you've been raising for 20 levels? Reset to zero. All those other skills you've been learning for 20 levels, like Bind Wound and Baking? Reset to zero. All those hit points you had as a 20th level character? Gone. You're a 1st Level character with the same HP as any 1st level character would have based on your class and STA. You may have been a 20th level Ogre SK with 1000 hp before, but now you're a 1st level Ogre Enchanter with 30 HP. All the equipment you had on you? Gone. You're now the proud owner of 5 biscuits, 5 flasks of milk, and the standard Newbie weapon for your class. (Sure, this could be bypassed with the help of a friend. But then it's just like twinking, and that's pretty common in the game. So you're not really making the situation worse.) <br><br>4a) The character's deity is also changed if the new class is incompatible with the character's original deity. The new class/deity combination will not improve faction with anyone. Everybody who disliked you before still dislikes you. But faction can get worse, depending on the nature of the deity change. <br><br>5) This is a one-time only quest. Once you've changed your class, you can't change it back, or change to another class. (Word gets around that you've changed your class once, and other guild leaders will refuse to accept you on the assumption that you're a dilettante.) <br><br>So, to illustrate an example: <br><br>Throckmorton the Troll wants to be a Ranger. To become a Ranger, Throckmorton has to first find a way to increase faction with one of the Ranger guilds in the game (Kithicor Rangers, Protectors of the Pine, or Champions of Faydark) until he is considered an "Ally" of this guild. Note that being an Ally with one of these guilds doesn't necessarily convey the automatic ability to wander nonchalantly up to the guild trainers. For example, if Throckmorton raises his Protectors of the Pine faction without raising his JaggedPine Treefolk faction, then his trip to see Hager Sureshot in Surefall Glade will end the minute he runs across one of the druids in Surefall. <br><br>Once he has found a way to increase faction to Ally, and found a way to approach the "change-of-class" quest NPC without getting killed, he then has to wait until he's 20th level before he can even do the quest. Once he hits 20th level, he's given a quest along the lines of "Go get a common drop from a rare MOB and bring it back." Once he completes this quest, he is transformed into a 1st level character of the new class. He has the original STR, STA, DEX, etc stats that he started with initially, but all his combat skills are reset to zero and his HP is calculated based on his new class and current Level and STA. So before the change, he was a 20th level Warrior with several hundred HP. Now he's a 1st level Ranger with 30 HP. <br><br>Since he can't be a Ranger and worship Cazic-Thule, he also had to switch deities. So he picked Karana. Alas, the only people who've heard about his conversion are the people in Neriak, Grobb, and Oggok. So anybody he was KOS to before, he's still KOS to now. Plus he's now KOS in places he used to not be KOS in. <br><br>The reason I think this will work is because: <br><br>1) It won't be a cakewalk. Being allied with the Bard Guild in Qeynos doesn't mean a thing if you're KOS to the Qeynos Guards and the Qeynos Merchants. So if you're an Ogre who wants to be a Bard, you'll either have to find some way to sneak in to the Bard Guild without being seen by any of the merchants or guards, or you'll have to raise faction with the Qeynos Guards and Merchants as well. <br><br>2) It's not easy to abuse. Requiring that someone be Allied faction *and* 20th level before even being given the *quest* to change class will keep a lot of folks from doing it, because they won't want to go through all the tedium of raising faction for 20 levels, only to get to start all over at level 1 and go back through the first 20 levels again. <br><br>3) It's not unbalancing. Your faction won't be any better after the class change than it was before. However, it might very well be worse. And being an weak Erudite Warrior or a dumb Troll Enchanter will confer its own challenges. <br><br>4) It's consistent with existing fiction. Yes, in the world of Norrath, most Ogres are mindless brutes who eat dwarves and beat each other with swords just for funsies. So no Ogre can *start* as a Bard. That's just not part of the Ogre culture on Norrath. But if an Ogre goes adventuring, meets a Bard, and decides that he RILLY RILLY RILLY wants to *be* a Bard, he can, if he's willing to pay his dues. <br><br>5) It encourages creativity and roleplaying. People will be encouraged to come up with reasons for why their Gnome is a Shadow Knight, or that their Ogre is an Enchanter, and this is a good thing. And, for the most part, I think that the majority of the people who would even bother doing this will be those people who are inclined towards roleplaying anyways. <br><br>Now, obviously, this may not necessarily be an easy coding job. But from a gameplay, game balance, and game fiction standpoint, I think it makes a whole lot of sense. I can't think of any negatives that would occur from a system like this. <br><br>Wow. Like I said, this was a long post. I hope you read it, and I hope it makes sense. I cannot express how much I would [b]***LOVE*** to play on a server that had a mechanism like I describe for changing classes. I play on Brell. I've been playing on Brell since August 1999. I love my guild, and I love my guildmates. And I would leave them all in a heartbeat to play on a server that would allow me to be an Ogre Bard or an Erudite Warrior. (Actually, I wouldn't really be leaving them. I know 'em well enough that they'd be racing me to the new server so they could play a neat new character.) So I'm asking you to please please PLEASE look this over and don't reject it out of hand just because you don't personally agree with it. Even if this isn't something you would want to implement on all the servers, I think it's something you could easily implement one one server. So those of us who wanted to be unique characters could do so, while those of you who think it "breaks fiction" wouldn't have to play on that server and wouldn't have to be confronted with High Elf Monks and Dwarf Magicians. <br><br>Thanks a lot for your time! <br><br>Ruatha Kneeslasher<br>48th Level Gnome Warriorette <br>Skyfire is what Lavastorm wants to be when it grows up... ]</i></font><br><br>My response to you is the same that it was to the last person. In a world with no restrictions, you can't be an iconoclast. <br><br>I love to play the outcast. I love having some sort of stigma attached to my characters. In a recent D&D campaign we were to play members of a once-great society that had fallen to a plague. They now find themselves surrounded by wild lands. Into those wild lands they toss their criminals, and those criminals are often bitter.<br> <br>When handed the character creation information, I read that we could play outcasts if we chose to. The risks would be incredible (poorly treated by the bulk of the civilized people of the world, poorly treated by your own folk, no chance of resurrection in a world where raising the dead is not uncommon and many more). The GM stressed this several times in the written material and in person. I know my fellow players, we've been playing together for years. I knew that at most three of us would choose to be outcasts. It turns out only two of us did (the other went to the other extreme, hating outcasts to with a passion). <br><br>I wouldn't have chosen to be an outcast if it wouldn't have been a hard character to play, and I certainly wouldn't have done it if I thought that the majority of the group would have done it. <br><br>But that's a small group, and a group that knows that when our GM says "playing an outcast is going to be HARD", he means it. <br><br>When you're talking about thousands of players, a large number of which are fans of the same fantasy authors that we're all fans of, you'll find that a large number of players will want to play the outcast. They either won't believe that it will be hard to do, or they'll expect things to be made easier if they complain enough. <br><br>That's why I love the new rules for Sullon Zek. You can play the iconoclast, the outsider, and there are real in-game consequences for that choice. <br><br>Without those consequences (making it hard to accomplish won't be a consequence, once you've done that, then things will be smooth sailing) you're unique Drizzt will be one of many Drizzts, and he won't be nearly as much fun. And he certainly won't be the unique character that he is in the world of his creator. In a novel the character can remain unique. Make him an option in a massively multiplayer game and he will become too common. <br><br>That's my opinion, anyhow. <br><br>Runti wrote: <br><br>Absor, <br><br>I have to agree with your recent comments about the players needing to fit into the world of Norath. For most roleplayers, the most fun comes from playing a character who is different from the norm. Thus the desire for dark elf bards and iksar paladins. The problem is that most roleplayers are used to worlds with 4 to 8 PCs and millions of NPCs. Norath has more PCs than player race NPCs. If too many people are "different" the races lose any sense of culture. Better to be restricted to a strong well thought out story than to wander through a muddle of incongruities. ]</i></font><br><br>/em nods.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Sullon Zek</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hey Absor/whoever reads this...will you the development team notify us the players when something gets changed/fixed on Sullon during this testing phase (ex: you allow Rogues to Pickpocket and you post this change on the developers forum) or will (when it comes into effect) you simply have Ester broadcast it once and let those 400 or so people that are on at that instant be the only ones to know?
