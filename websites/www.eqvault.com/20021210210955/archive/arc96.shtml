<SPAN CLASS="newstext">
Gordon addressed a few posts on the Gameplay Board today.  For your convience I have compiled them all in the following text:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061410-3.html"><b>Roleplaying Server Thread</b></a><br>My understanding from reading the first post, and please let me know if I'm off base, is that you'd like us to set up a server, designated as "Roleplay", provide guidelines for playing on the server, with more GM/Guide support for dynamic content. Furthermore, though the guidelines would exist, there would be no enforcement of it. <br><br>Assuming that summation is close to what you are proposing, I'm pretty sure that your goals wouldn't be met in the long run. I think immediately people would go to the server with ideas about always staying in character. However, there are also people who play the game that would go there just to annoy the roleplayers. Then there would also be people who would go there due to having more GM/Guide support for dynamic content. In the end, without any enforcement, which most will agree cannot be applied consistantly, I think they would end up less in-character role-playing than other servers in the game. <br><br>Experience has shown that without enforcement in an environment such as this, the desired condition cannot be met. Take this board as an example. Flaming, insulting, swearing, threatening, and being a general anti-social troublemaker is not allowed on these boards per the Station Terms of Service. Attempts to ask those people who post in that fashion to keep it respectful and courteous further drives the overall environment towards the undesirable. Why? Because it's not enforced. We are going to enforce those rules in the near future, and it will either work, or the boards will be shut down. I think that an unenforced roleplay server would have the same problem. <br><br>But we can come up with consistant rules to enforce the boards, where we can't with a subjective concept such as roleplaying. I really like Har's definition of roleplaying, but can we expect any 10 people to enforce that definition in the same way?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063545-2.html"><b>"Reconsider Yellow Spell Damage Text"</b></a><br>There's obviously people here who both like and dislike the yellow color. Given that we introduced the yellow color, I don't think that we'll make everyone happy by changing it back, so we'll probably leave it as is. Perhaps if we had left it white/black it wouldn't be an issue, but the cats out of the bag :)<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063537.html"><b>"Why was Invisibility Nerfed, again?"</b></a><br>It seems that after nearly every patch someone feels that invisibility has been nerfed in duration. I know that I've had to make posts such as this after well over a dozen patches since I've been at Verant. <br><br>Just to be clear, invisibility was touched in this patch, aside from making it so that pets are no longer a valid target. In order to try to head off future claims of this nature, I *promise* that I will let you know if we ever touch invisibility's duration. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063739.html"><b>"As a Master of Magical Damage, why is a Ranger's channeling skill higher than mine?"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Rangers cap at 215, Wizards at 200. What is the vision behind this?]</i></font><br><br>As it turns out, we increased the channeling cap for pure casters in the last patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/059195.html"><b>The Vision</b></a><br>I've answered dozens of questions entitled "what is the vision". Why is it that these keep coming up with people assuming that it is some tangible thing that can be put up on a website for all to view? Have you ever said to anyone, "That wasn't really what I had in mind..."? What you are saying is that it doesn't agree with your vision. <br><br>There is not some all-encompassing document that I can post somewhere for everyone to read, because it's an ever-growing and ever-changing concept. When something new comes up, we sit down and ask, "Is this what we had in mind?" A discussion follows at which time we decide whether or not it is. The vision is every email exchanged by every member of the dev team. It's the original design document for EverQuest (which will not be posted). It's the understanding that comes out of formal meetings in the conference room and the informal ones around the watercooler. It's every hope that everyone here had and has for EverQuest. <br><br>Do you want to know the vision? Read our web site, read our posts, play the game, and ask yourself honestly what we had in mind, or, ask me. I answer questions every day here that consist basically of, "Why did you do XXX?" The answer to that question is the vision. But please, don't expect me to be able to lay out anything and everything that everyone ever had in mind about everything to do with the game. It's not that simple. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I dislike playing a game where 95% of the important information is hidden from the consumer's eyes. ]</i></font><br><br>That 95% of that information is meant to be discovered by you while you play the game. If you choose to go to spoiler sites to find out as much as you can, that is your choice, but we won't be divulging the mystery of the game. We feel that mystery is important in the game and that no one should know with certainty everything that there is to know. That's our vision. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: The only thing I know is what the VISION isn't. It isn't kiting, it isn't FD pulling, it isn't having good stuff, it isn't a lot of things. ]</i></font></UL>

Something did, and when it did, war was declared.<br> <br>The Nektulos Forest was red and black with blood spilled from both sides. Allying themselves with the humans were the Gnomes, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings. The forces of the dark were pushed back to the bridge crossing the river. Soon, though, they mounted a savage counterattack and began pushing the forces of light back into the East Commons.<br> <br>Unfortunately, the server decided to go down at this point.<br><br>However, another battle will likely occur tonight, so if you want to experience the thrill of group PvP combat, come to Tallon Zek and join one of the sides.

The following message is now up on the EQ Patch Server:<UL>July 20th, 3:00pm<br>-----------------<br><br><b>*Emergency Patch*</b><br><br>Due to the problems encountered in yesterday's patch, some additional data has been moved to the live servers today.  As part of this patch, three new changes are included:<br><br>- /Consent no longer gives other players permission to loot your corpse.  Instead, it only gives them the ability to drag your corpse using the /corpse command.  This change is due to player request stemming from number of customer service issues raised by some players who were using /consent as a way to steal the belongings of other players.  The change will eliminate those concerns and make the game more enjoyable for all of those involved.<br>- Yesterday's patch changed the way spell-damage messages are reported to the caster.  The new text was dark blue, making it hard to distinguish from the background when in HUD mode.  The text color has been changed to "yellow" due to player request.<br>- Duel messages will no longer be broadcast to the world unless the winner of the duel is over 10th level.  This should greatly reduce the number of duels with inappropriate names that have been occurring in the game.<br><br>We would like to apologize to everyone for the problems stemming from yesterday's patch, and let you know that we have taken steps to greatly reduce the possibility that something of that nature could happen in the future.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Gordon made a few posts recently on the Gameplay Board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063211.html"><b>Karana Split</b></a><br>I do find it strange that your guild wasn't moved. The second attempt only netted 169 accounts wishing to move. Though I was pleased to see that we did get most of the people who wanted to move in the first attempt, even given the short notice, I was still quite surprised to find it so small. <br><br>Have your friends kick an email to <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a>. They'll see what they can do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063241.html"><b>Lack of Plane of Sky Items in Last Patch</b></a><br>I'm not sure what items your guild has, however, it was the end result of quests in the Plane of Sky that received some enhancements. Intermediate items didn't, since most of those are components for the quests themselves. Most of the quests in the Plane of Sky have yet to be completed, so the number of people who saw increases might be pretty small.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063243.html"><b>Do I need to replace my Branch?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Your branch will remain in game as is  That decision has not been made yet.]</i></font> <br><br>It is true that this decision hasn't been made yet. We stopped the drops of the items pending the decision of what we are going to do with the existing ones, if anything. We'll probably discuss it Monday in the tuning meeting. <br><br>As you know, we seriously dislike making changes to items that already exist in game. However there are exceptions where we must for game balance. We're also considering the twig that everyone likes as well.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063280.html"><b>Loot Tables/Foraging Bug: Blackout</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Actually i doubt you've missed it as in haven't seen or heard of it, just that it appears you've made afternoon rounds for posting on the boards and I've seen no response to what is obviously a very heated issue. <br><br>Namely, the bug with the loot tables and foraging last night. The worst thing to do is to leave us in the dark about this. It has been okay for us to debate it this morning while I'm sure you had many other things going on but now that you have seen fit to post on other topics some sort of update would be really appreciated. <br><br>What is Verants current stance on what happened? We know there was a loot bug, we know it has happened before, we have heard rumors of the scope of this problem (large and disturbing), and heard rumors that no corrective action is planned by Verant to restore the state of the game prior to the "incident". Does/has Verant taken any action to correct this? What would really help is some solid facts, and those are only going to come from one person. You.]</i></font><br><br>Rolling back the clock is always a very sensitive issue. <br><br>The problem was found very quickly, limiting its impact in game. In addition, the loot that was turning up was loot that was otherwise available within the zone, not just random in nature. It's not like level 60 gear was showing up on large rats or anything, people actually had to be in a zone where the equipment was found normally. <br><br>In this case, after weighing additional downtime necessary to do a rollback, the inconvenience to those who earned items during that time, and the loss of experinece and play time, we've decided not to pursue it further. <br><br>We wish to extend our sincere apologies to everyone over the entire issue.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063082.html"><b>/Roleplay Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: No Aixsponsa.

We'll probably be patching the servers again either today or tomorrow, but this stuff is part of the client.</UL>

Gordon was busy on the boards late last night and early this morning responding to several player-made posts.  Here's the skinny:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063206.html"><b>Damage Rates</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We hardly do 10-15% of the total of group damages (if you dont believe me i post you logs). ]</i></font><br><br>Even if true, it only puts the class a few percentage points below an equal contrabution. Of course, equality in damage dealt isn't a goal when in a group. I doubt that a group would expect a bard, for instance, to even do that much damage. Overall it depends on the makeup of a group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We dont have decent Kunark weapons.]</i></font> <br><br>I guess that's subjective. There's definitely some good paladin weapons out there, and your skill with them is nearly equal to that of a warrior. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We take more xp than others class.]</i></font> <br><br>Depends on what the other classes are. Also remember that race figures into the formula as well. Anyone who groups with an ogre or troll warrior shouldn't disparage, for instance, a human paladin. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We are not done for decent pulling.]</i></font> <br><br>But you can certainly take damage, decrease the groups downtime, and perhaps you also have a good reputation and personality, which are the primary factors that determine who gets into a group. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Or yeah i forgot, we will probably get invited because we can cast daring with our wonderfull DW helm each 11 sec ? A mob level 42+ doubles hits you for 120, daring is so usefull.]</i></font> <br><br>Let's not argue this any more. I think that it's obvious that the spell wasn't meant to be a combat healing spell. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063209.html"><b>Good Decisions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Kudos to Verant for the resurecction improvement and the drag only command (although I'd have rather seen it as an extra command not a replacement). These are both good decisions, and ones that came from user feedback, including mine.]</i></font> <br><br>Thanks for the note. This is the first post I've seen where someone noticed that he resurrection problem had been fixed to the level that was suggested. Not only do we keep experience from being lost until you agree to the Res, but we also tell you who's casting it and what they are casting. Both of those were as suggested. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: BTW, I'm sure Abashi is working on the "say no now, say yes later" communication issue, but don't beat him up for this, it's a lot better hfor him to change his position to the right one than to stick with the wrong position just to avoid changing his position!]</i></font> <br><br>I'm not sure what you mean by "say no now, say yes later", are you referring to the dragging, or where the resurrection issue wasn't considered a bug? Our "Vision" must be somewhat flexible due to constant changes and new content that's put into the game. There's only a relatively small number of issues that we are absolutely firm on. The others take the form of there being "no short term plan" to implement a particular item. <br><br>We don't like to tie our hands by completely ruling issues out too often.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062782.html"><b>Monk Damage Rate</b></a><br>There's no problem with the amount of damage being done by monks at this time. Though a flying kick of 3 points of damage does sound a little strange, raising the minimum damage would only increase the damage output of the monk overall, which isn't warranted at this time.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062772.html"><b>New Spell Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ok..so instead of the rat saying hit by non-melee for xxx dmg..it now states a rat is hit by non-melee for xxx dmg...big deal..]</i></font> <br><br>Well it was something that people were complaining about for some time. I did however get an email from a Game mag editor who felt we should have left it is, as it was "practically an institution." <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: and now the message is in blue..do you realize how hard that is to see? change it back to white please..]</i></font> <br><br>Sorry about that. The one programmer likes that dark blue color. I've personally only found it visible in Everfrost and Oasis/Ro. I'll talk to him.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062743.html"><b>Melee Weapon Specialization</b></a><br>Actually this has been ruled out. Melee types are already as good with their swords as they need to be from a balance perspective. If we were going to implement this, we'd have to reduce their current effectiveness just to give the specialization something to do.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062764.html"><b>Dungeon Issue</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We can't "do" dungeons if they are full.]</i></font> <br><br>Yeah, we know. Try some of the Kunark dungeons which were built to encourage people to move through them. Of course we can't stop people from camping entirely should they choose to do that. Luckily there are dungeons that people don't camp. Perhaps you could try some of those.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062739.html"><b>Changing the Burning Rapier Picture</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Just wondering if it would be possible for you guys to change the burning rapier graphic so that it actually burns or something. I just finished this long quest & although I like the weapon I would have expected, that for a quest item that takes this long & is this hard to get (at least for me), that it would be burning.]</i></font> <br><br>That would be cool, but we probably wouldn't attach a particle effect to a weapon of that caliber. Particle effects are reserved for the really nifty items. You should start seeing more of them show up in the game in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/061819-2.html"><b>Enchanters in PvP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: please, you have nerfed enchanters in PvP so badly that I now have to run from fights because players have such good resistance gear at lvl's 40+ that I cant even touch a "green" con....It's really making this game no fun.]</i></font> <br><br>The classes in PvP weren't setup so that they'd be equal. Perhaps you might not stand a chance in one-on-one combat in PvP (I'm not an experienced enchanter). *Someone*, or some class in this case has to be at the bottom of the heap for certain situations. If enchanters "certain situation" is PCs with 130 MR, that seems fair from my point of view. You might consider going "pking" with a shaman. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Fix our Illusion spells more effectivly instead of just nerfing them. Enchanters need the element of suprise, its very fun and confusing when I used to use illusion: DE and go PKing,]</i></font> <br><br>The way the illusion spells are currently set up doesn't rob you of the "element of surprise", merely the "element of confusion" once that attack has begun assuming you are using a racial illusion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Give us a non-magic based spell whether it be a DD, Mez, anything that we are known for, we have been hit with the nerfing of charm, fear, illusions, ect. its tuff to cope with these losses]</i></font> <br><br>Can't really do that without affecting the PvE aspect of the game, so it's not at all likely. Enchanters are certainly strong enough in that area.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062702.html"><b>Deepwater Helm</b></a><br>Since I notice that a number of threads are popping up on the subject, I thought I'd address the issue here: <br><br>The change really only affects those who were using the helm for healing. I think that it's fairly obvious that the helm was intended as a buff, rather than a way to heal. When's the last time you saw a cleric healing someone with Daring? <br><br>Anyway, we considered replacing the spell effect with one that increased MaxHP but not current HP (thus removing the "healing" affect), but decided that increasing the casting time should address the main part of the problem.

A few moments ago, Gordon created the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/063240.html">following thread</a> on the Gameplay Board concerning Pets and Invibility:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>I've noticed a number of threads inquiring into the change to invisibility made in the patch. I thought I'd consolodate the issue and discuss it here.<br><br>First, I'd like to state that the change does not keep pets from casting invisibility on themselves, so the magician air pets will still be able to do their thing.<br><br>Now, the change was made due to the way spells interact on NPCs. Basically, by going through a series of steps, people were able to make their pets permanently invisible. On the PvP servers, this created a huge issue where people being attacked couldn't figure out what was going on. On the "normal" servers, people were charming creatures, making them permanently invisible, then releasing them into the zone. I'm sure you are aware of the problems that a few invisible sand giants can cause. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon announced some big changes to the /consent system in a post made at 12:07am this morning <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062897.html">on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><i>Hello all,<br><br>Many people have suggested over the past few months that we should implement a version of the /consent command to give people the option to drag a corpse (via /corpse) rather than loot it, due to the amount of item theft that takes place. As you know, we previously ruled out such an option for various reasons, not the least of which were technical limitations.<br><br>After considering issue for some time, and taking into account the customer-service issues created by those who loot corpses and steal items under the guise of /consent, we've decided that a change to its operation is warranted. In the next patch, /consent will be changed to give permission to drag the corpse only, not to loot it. Other people will not be able to loot your corpse. <br><br>Though we realize that some will miss the ability to /consent in the previous fashion, the proliferation of NODROP items in game has made asking someone else to loot your corpse a very infrequent event. Given the ability to do one or the other, consent for loot, or consent for drag, we believe that most people would prefer the option to /consent for drag.<br><br>We hope that this change will address everyone's concerns by eliminating the amount of antisocial conduct that surrounds corpse looting.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

In regards to last night's server outage, Gordon Wrinn made the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062824.html">following post on the Gameplay Board</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>We apologize for this evening's outage. We've located the problem and the operations team is working to resolve it now. A problem with the patch was causing inappropriate items to drop across many servers and zones, and also caused some high end loot to be gotten via the forage skill.<br><br>As a result of this outage, we are currently repatching. This puts us about 2 to 4 hours before the servers will be back up. <br><br>As part of this repatch, spells will be redone thus fixing the Jolt spell which had reverted to its old casting time, and the Howling Harpoon will be fixed as it was procing Dragon Breath. Furthermore, a bug with haste items, which caused the highest-end ones (from the Plane of Sky) to be only as good as your average dragon loot has been fixed. Finally, the bug that causes you to lose invisibility (even though it appears to still be up) when someone casts a beneficial spell upon you has been fixed.<br><br>Again, I apologize for the outage and thank you for your understanding.<br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon made the following announcement on the Gameplay Board late last night:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>We had a problem with our spell database earlier this week, necessitating restoring it from backup. This caused a few things made in the week or so before that to revert to their old state. We went through the changes that we made and *thought* that we caught all of them.

Yes, the servers are definitely down.  Rob sent me the following report which helps shed some light on the reason why:<BLOCKQUOTE>FYI:<br><br>The servers are back down because the drop tables were broken.  They<br>were taken down about five minutes after I /petitioned this in game, but<br>others probably did as well so I doubt the servers being down is my<br>fault alone.

A new Patch Message is up on the EverQuest Patch Server.  Here it is:<UL><b>July 19th, 7:00am</b><br>-----------------<br> <br>***Patch Day***<br> <br><b>*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*</b><br> <br>- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to someplace "safer".<br>- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.  <br>- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity filter.<br>- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked doors.<br>- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against non-moving, non-rooted targets.  These restrictions allowed us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.<br>- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.<br>- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".<br>- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history.  The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that the old one was.<br>- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.<br>- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.  <br>- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons.  Take care to take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br> <br><b>*Poison*</b><br> <br>- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).<br>- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.<br>- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".<br>- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.<br>- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br> <br><b>*General Crafts*</b><br> <br>- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.<br>- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.<br>- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be crafted.<br>- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.<br>- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.<br>- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.<br>- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item".  <br> <br><b>*Items*</b><br> <br>- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.<br>- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.<br>- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.<br>- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around in the world.  Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".<br>- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a bit more useful.<br>- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time.  The function of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br> <br><br><b>*/consent*</b><br> <br>Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds.  Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report.  Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can undo it.<br> <br><b>*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*</b><br> <br>There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule.  Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you alone.  The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their faction.<br> <br><b>*Regen Effects*</b><br> <br>This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while under the affect of regen.<br> <br><b>*Keyed Dungeons*</b><br> <br>The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago.  Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point.  We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br> <br><b>*Barbed Scale Whip*</b><br> <br>In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already in-game.  It has been changed back to its original stats.<br> <br><b>*Hiding Corpses*</b><br> <br>A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client.  This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen.  This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay.  It will be particularly useful in the planes.  The command supports the following arguments:<br> <br>- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.<br>- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your group.<br>- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br> <br>For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone.  You can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it. <br> <br><b>*Resurrection*</b><br> <br>The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting.  Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES.  Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br> <br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>Thanks Blammo!

A bug was brought to the attention of Gordon Wrinn on the Gameplay Board last night.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062484.html">original post followed by Gordon's response</a>:<UL>Abashi..can you explain why the Deepwater Helm for Paladins with the effect Daring can be cast repeatedly and continuosly gives a hit point increase? Meaning, a paladin basically uses this effect on the helm for a continuous, mana free healing on himself and others. I personally watched a paladin effectively out heal a cleric using this helmet. <br><br>HOW IS THIS NOT CLASS UNBALANCING? No this is not item envy, or class envy..I am a 41 cleric, but other classes have no qualms about speaking up when their abilities are infringed upon, and this situation is reminiscent of the Treant Fists pre-nerf. Why is the effect on this (and prob other armor) able to be cast continuously and nonstop with additional HPS given from the spell effects basically allowing the user to heal non stop and continuosly? As a 41 cleric I was and am appalled at this scenario..it reminds me of the pre-nerfed Treant Fists, when monks were continuosly casting heals. Is this going to be addressed or not? Why cant you make the effect self-only and make it timed? I seriously doubt your intent was to have the items used in this fashion, but damn it....don't you test any of these things before you ut them in the game? If it isn't going to be changed then I think clerics should have the terror forged mask reinstated with the call of bones effect. That effect for the mask is no more game unbalancing than this helm and other "effect armor" :P<br><br>Jachra Bindwounder<br>41 Cleric of Innoruuk<br><br><b><i>Actually it is. So much so that tomorrow's patch will put a substantial casting-time on the effect.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon made two posts (three counting the original post) in the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/062455.html">following thread</a> spotted on the Gameplay Board this evening:<UL>My buddy had a pair of dwarven work boots.

Would this work in this case? Thanks.<br><br><b><i>The item morph bug was corrected some time ago, however were it to occur now, it would be detectable in our logs.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Here's post #2:<UL>Here's a question though: What if it can't be verified as a bug or a scam? What if an item disappears, and your GMs can clearly see that the player did NOT trade it or drop it or destroy it? <br><br><b><i> If you had it, and you didn't trade it, drop it, or destroy it, and you no longer have it, that should suffice.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
