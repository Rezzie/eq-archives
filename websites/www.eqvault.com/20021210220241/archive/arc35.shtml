Here's the latest load of posts written by Alan VanCouvering on the Developer's Corner:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000203.html"><b>Deity Server</b></a><br>Rubikoob wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First off, let me say I very much like the idea of the Deity-based team PvP server, and personally plan on having my 1 character there. I hope the testing goes well. <br><br>However, I have some doubts regarding the balancing of the teams. From the charts I've seen (thanks to EQLizer), the good team has 34 race/class combinations compared to 48 for the neutrals and 45 for the evils. There are 2 races which cannot be evil (Dwarves and High Elves), 3 races which cannot be neutral (Trolls, Ogres, Iksar), and 7 (!) races which cannot be good (All the short races, the pure-evils, and the Dark Elves). The good team has no one able to cast Summon Corpse (I realize, however, that it has already been said that a method will be given them), and no race which is pure-good. While it is a valid point that having a race which is purely one alignment is as much a detriment as a benefit, I believe each of the teams ought to have at least one such race, representing a sort of core or foundation. <br><br>In my opinion, this set up looks pretty well stacked against the good-aligned team. I suspect that the new, upcoming Vah Shir race may be the answer. This is probably even the intended place for that race... but I'd like to hear a comment directly from someone at Verant to confirm/deny/poke fun at this... prediction? If the Vah Shir show up, pure-good, with an average number of classes to choose from, it will bring the good team right about into balance with the others. <br><br>Thanks for your time. The work you do here on the board is very much appreciated. ]</i></font><br><br>Well, as I've said, it is entirely possible that Evil will be strongest on this server. But not so much for the reasons you've stated. <br><br>The number of race class combinations really doesn't matter. People will decide their team before they choose a race or class. The fact that there are more combinations for one or the other probably won't influence this decision. The only time it will matter is for those that prefer a class over all others. Those that want to be monks, for example, won't be able to be evil. But if they want to play a cleric, they can be on any team. The trick is that most of the classes are available to all teams. <br><br>It is, however, a much bigger issue that the evil team has more security, more unity. They will rule three cities completely, and one more almost completely. That will have a large bearing on their success as a team. <br><br>But, really, it will come down to how many players on a server will want to play on each team. If the majority of people want to play good, then good will have an advantage, regardless of the situation. <br><br>Some of the solutions that I've seen, like moving Rallos to the neutral team, or Karana to the good, won't work. That sort of change would really mess up the class availability. Making Karana good would mean there are no neutral rangers or druids, and that seems wrong on a lot of levels. Making Rallos neutral would fragment the evil teams, leaving them worse off than any other team (as opposed to better off like they are now), and it would mean no evil bards, so no tracking&#8230; <br><br>I'm real convinced that the current organization is the best available, even though it wasn't my design. :)<br><br>Sslith <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Will guilds created on Sullon during the test phase transfer over when the server goes live? ]</i></font><br><br>Nope. Sorry, it's a full wipe. <br><br>Mancubus-VZ wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well I hit the wrong button in the process of writing the last message so lets try again. Im just hoping to get a response or some notification that this bug is in fact a bug and is being looked into. When a bard has targeted a threatening PC opponent, usually for combat, the use of any group only beneficial spells cannot be used and the message, this Spell cannot effect this PC, comes up. I would assume this is a simple error, and requires a little coding, but any song a bard sings is not beneficial to your enemy. If I were to cast Selos on my group that is not beneficial to the enemy, in fact its the complete opposite. Not only is the song not affecting him directly, but now my entire group is running faster than the enemy making this spell an attack spell in essense. The only way to get beneficial group only songs to play is to tab target yourself and then tab target back to your opponent. This additional step takes a second or two and makes me as the bard lose track of what I was doing because my hands have to shift position in order to successfully attempt this maneuver. Any information or planning of fixing this bug would be greatly appreciated, mainly because bards are awesome PvPers, are fun to play, and it makes me sad to say this, but unless this bug is fixed the decision to play a bard on Live is about zero percent. ]</i></font><br><br>Looks like a bug. The team is aware of it, and we'll get it fixed before the server goes live. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You mentioned that you guys are leaning away from getting rid of the common tongue, such that everyone will be able to speak with everyone else. Are you sticking to that decision? Could you ask us players if we have a preference? :)  I mean, if the premise here is "hardcore roleplaying", inserting a language barrier seems like a logical step. If racial prejudices are going to become an important aspect of the server, it'd seem like a nice way to stir up conflicts a little by adding the confusion of an inability to comunicate. <br><br>And past that, it'd give people a reason to use the languages system that's already in the game. While I forsee that in the distant future everyone will have learned every spoken language just to avoid frustration (unless you could maybe limit the languages a person knows going by their intelligence score?), it'd at least make diplomacy something that requires a conscious effort. <br><br>-Ereet ]</i></font><br><br>We don't plan to make any language changes for this server. Any such changes will be a part of the consideration for a 'roleplaying' server at some (hopefully near) future time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Please take the time to read and listen to my concerns over the possible destruction of my guild. <br><br>That sounds ominous, I know, but that's exactly how much it frightened me to hear that there's the possibility of hardcoded teams on Vallon Zek. My concern stems from the fact that a "maybe" comment was given when you were asked if any of the rules from Sullon Zek would migrate to the Teams servers. Yes, I am aware that the Teams servers were set up to allow a four way war among the race teams. However, as far as I'm aware, it has never been mandated that we MUST wage a four way war among the race teams. Having the option to PvP with the other teams is great, but what of alliances? What of treaties and teaming up against the common foe? What of Roleplaying Good against Evil, Light against Dark? Hardcoding the teams on Vallon Zek would disallow such things. Yes, I know that there are players who are begging for exactly that, but now that they have Sullon Zek, I'm hoping that Vallon and Tallon Zek will be left as is, or at the very least, that one will be left as is, with a movelog enabled to allow a choice. <br><br>You see, my guild is a "Lighty" guild. It's composed of members from the three "Light" (ie non-Dark) races, with the exception of SK's and Necro's. That's right, we willingly accept the handicap of not having SK's and Necro's, to Roleplay a guild of Light Races that battles Dark Races exclusively, in a war of Good vs Evil. We also enjoy PvE, operating as a team of guildmates supporting each other. Disallowing benificial buffs and heals to be cast across the race teams would ruin our ability to function as a guild in PvE AND PvP. In short, hardcoding the teams would destroy our guild. Destroy our guild, and it would destroy our desire to play. <br><br>My plea is this: Please allow at least ONE (if not both) of the Teams servers to remain as is, with regards to PvP rules. If any of the Sullon Zek rules (hardcoded teams, XP loss for PvP, etc) are migrated to a Teams server, then please only do this to one of them, and allow the other to stay the same, with a movelog to allow us the choice of how to play. We "Light vs. Dark" players enjoy the game, and want to continue to enjoy the game, but we can't play the game on non-PvP servers (because we can't fight the Dark races), and we can't play it on Sullon Zek (because we can't be a unified guild of Light races), so the only place we CAN play the game we love so much, is on Vallon and Tallon Zek. <br><br>I understand the desire of those who want to play the game of PvP with hardcoded teams. I'm glad that they have such a place now, on Sullon Zek. I would even understand it if ONE of the existing PvP Teams servers were changed to have hardcoded race teams, to suit the purists. However, please understand OUR (my guild and those like us) desire to play without hardcoded teams so that we can play "Light vs. Dark"/"Good vs. Evil" as well. We have such a place on Vallon and Tallon Zek, and we hope that it doesn't go away. <br><br>Again, there is a rich and thriving community already in place on Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek. Guilds with history and reputations (both good and bad). While some choose to play racial purists (which is currently supported by the rules) others choose to band together members of two, three, or even all four races to fight a common foe (which is ALSO currently supported by the rules). Disallowing cross-team buffs and heals in the future would destroy the existing community, wipe out many of the established guilds, and cause many, myself included, to simply quit playing because we would have lost our main source of enjoyment: our family. <br><br>Light vs. Dark players love EQ, too, Absor. Please keep at least one server available for us. <br><br>Thank you for reading, Absor, I do appreciate the work you do. Please communicate my fears and concerns to the appropriate people. I hope my fears are put to rest, for I do love playing EQ, but could not continue to play if my family (my guild) were destroyed. <br><br>Feel free to e-mail me privately if you don't want to post this on the Developer's Corner, although you may certainly do so if you wish. <br><br>Again, thanks. <br><br>Taliaferro Erucolindo<br>Officer of Giliath Lang<br>Vallon Zek<br>"My team? My team is Giliath Lang!" ]</i></font><br><br>I can't tell you what will happen about this, I don't know for certain yet. <br><br>But as far as I can tell, 'cross-teaming' was never intended on the team servers. It should be pretty obvious that the intent was that there be four teams, not two. And I fully expect (though, as I said, I'm not certain yet) that the teams will be locked down in the near future. <br><br>How that happens, whether it's both servers or just one (or neither&#8230;), I don't know. <br><br>This certainly does not mean that we think that there isn't some viability to a good vs. evil team server. It's obvious that there is. <br><br>And, frankly, in my opinion there are far too many 'abuses' available to people that cross team. Obviously I am not implying that you or your guild are the type of people to use such abuses, I wouldn't know. But the entire idea that it is possible to create immune healers and such by the existing system is something that bothers me a lot. <br><br>Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while for a final decision about the existing PvP servers as far as rule changes and such go. <br><br>Well, there have been nearly 500 comments since I opened this thread. Even those that haven't like certain of the decisions that we've made, have been enthusiastic about the idea in general. I'm very encouraged. Thanks for all the feedback.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>More Pet Questions</b></a><br>-Tamria- wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Whilst I'm not particularly bothered about pets poofing when I invis or ITU as I've gotten used to it. I think you insult the majority of pet class players by implying that a smart player shouldn't find it a problem. <br><br>There are many times I will be in a dungeon or somewhere and need to invis (whether to check out a spawn, go guide a friend in, go drag someone's corpse etc) but also want to keep my pet for saftey and convenience. Necro pets take a LONG time to cast so trying to remake a pet in a hostile area just because you had to invis to go drag a friend's corpse will tend to get you killed. <br><br>It's nothing to do with how smart players are it's to do with convenience. Like I said it's not a big deal to me, I got used to it many levels ago - just don't offend me by claiming it's not an issue for smart players. ]</i></font><br><br>Oh, now come on. I never said that any pet player was not smart for having to deal with these issues. What I said was that how you deal with them will determine if you are a good pet caster or a not so good one. It has nothing to do with being smart. I think of myself as smart, but I'm also not good at accounting. I have trouble learning new languages. But that doesn't mean I'm stupid. <br><br>The decisions that you make when playing your pet class has everything to do with how well you do with that character. It is indeed a problem for anyone playing such a class that they need to decide on the trade-offs all the time, no matter how smart they are.<br> <br>Don't try to make it sound like I'm calling anyone stupid because they have to decide which pet to summon for which location, or whether or not to try to keep their pet with them while looking for a corpse. The obstacles themselves (which is what I was talking about) have nothing to do with the abilities that people bring to bear for getting past them. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'm glad the owner doesnt panic and go poof when air pet goes invis :)<br><br>Lozza<br>TZ ]</i></font><br><br>Some do&#8230; :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000202.html"><b>Summon Companion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Quote - Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug. Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that on to Ester. <br><br>Very nice of you to finally mention this, as I have personally submitted detailed information regarding this very case. <br><br>A couple things:<br>1) It is NOT a rare case. This is an absolute fact, which happens every time a pet owner gets charmed. I can personally duplicate this to any VI staff in-game as many times as they wish. GM's have replied to my /bugreport and /petition's saying it is intentional to force pet owners to camp or zone after getting charmed to regain the ability to summon / resummon a pet. <br><br>2) I have personally submitted this very problem to these boards in excess of 5 times. I have used /bug and /petition in-game over a dozen times submitting this very problem. So, though I am only one person, VI has heard of this bug many times. <br><br>3) Bug or intentional, it is NOT fair in "any" circumstance for pet owners to be stripped of their ability to summon / resummon their pet. If this is a bug, please fix it promptly. If this is intentional, please seek employment elsewhere. <br><br>4) The "rogue pet" fix only removed the ability for players to create a rogue pet without the intervention of a NPC. A pet which is charmed by a NPC will become a experience-giving KOS to everybody NPC if the pet owner zones. <br><br>I have personally had my level 54 water pet get charmed by the level 30ish NPC enchanter at the lake in Qeynos Hills. When I zoned back, there was my old water pet, scowling, and killing all NPC's that came within range, including the original NPC which charmed it. Fortunately, the pet gives pretty good experience per kill. <br><br>-Anthe ]</i></font><br><br>When I said that it sounded like a rare case, I meant just that. It's probably not that common that you get charmed. I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a character. <br><br>And I looked it up. The bug has been in the database since December. So we are aware of it, and have been. Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I commend Verant for giving this to all the pet classes, and realizing it has little to do with roleplay, balance, or power but is a nice solution to some gameplay limitations (i.e., pathing). Just why did it take you so long to reach that decision after granting it to Mages? This will be a big help to the main pet classes - mages and necros and is the appropriate level at 44 as at lvl 46 planes and bigger raids begin for most charaters. <br><br>Now if you would only do something about fear and resists for necro pets it just might provide the necro with one of their primary weapons in raids/epic encounters. <br><br>Sarasate ]</i></font><br><br>Well, this is a case where were conflicted. There was a feeling that we should try to further distinguish magicians and their power over their pets, and also the feeling that it would be a useful tool for any pet caster. <br><br>We decided to err (if we were indeed erring) on the side of caution and give it only to magicians (imagine the issues if we gave it to everyone first and then decided to make it a magician only spell&#8230;). After letting it stew a while, we've decided to change our minds. <br><br>As for the fear thing&#8230; you'll have to wait a bit and see what or if we do anything with that. The same issue applies here. But, unlike Summon Companion, there is no clear need for fear resistance as a matter of a gameplay issue. It is something to consider for a 'class balance' issue, but that issue is two-sided. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Please dont give this spell to Enchanters.. <br><br>Enchanters mess with the Mind and Enchant lumps of stuff.. <br><br>I do not want the ability to "Summon". I am distinctly an Enchanter not a generic "Caster" and dont want to be treated in such a way. <br><br>Provide me a roleplaying reason why Enchanters now have the ability to Summon. Then give me access to other Summoning abilities. <br><br>Mahar Delusion<br>Enchanter ]</i></font><br><br>Of all the responses we've received on this issue, this is the kind that has baffled me the most. <br><br>Several enchanters have responded saying that this spell won't help them and that they don't want it. I suggest that you will find it useful in some cases. And, well, who in the world would say no to a new spell? Seems odd to me. <br><br>As for your concern that there is no 'roleplaying' reason to have it, I have the easy answer. Don't buy it if it doesn't fit your concept of an enchanter. <br><br>Aeadiel-Sevaan wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Does this spell wipe pets aggro list? If it doesnt i think it should. Would be totally pointless if a enc summoned his pet back and it just took off after the mob it was on again. ]</i></font><br><br>There's no need for that. If the pet has something on its hate list, that something will have the pet on its hate list, and the spell won't work anyhow. <br><br>Korinna wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Not to ruffel any feathers, but isnt't the reasoning for giving all pet casters the summon pet spell contrary to the same reason you won't allow other (than necro) pet casters get voice graft? As you stated with regards to Summon Companion, it's not balance issue. <br><br>I personal can't stand playing the straight caster classes, but for those who do, voice graft I've seen to be used as a nice way for the friendly comedicly inclined players to pass the time while on their rears. I'd imagine the necromancers out there wouldnt mind giving Goner someone to chat with who was likewise summoned to to anothers bidding. I can even see it now: Goner & Jibantik- of course, the militia wouldnt enjoy their jokes if the casters brought their act to the stage in freeport! ]</i></font><br><br>It is certainly a possibility that all pet classes could get Voice Graft. There is no compelling gameplay reason that they shouldn't have it. <br><br>But, at the same time there is no compelling gameplay reason that they should.

Brad spoke on exploiting bugs in response to more feedback and letters received about the banning of the guild Conquest.  Here's the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000211.html">update</a> from the Dev Corner:<UL>Hello all, <br><br>Recently I've not only received emails specifically regarding the Conquest guild issue, but also about exploiting in general. <br><br>First, some people are confused as to what an exploit is and how they're to know what an exploit is. Some are also afraid they might accidentally exploit and then be disciplined. <br><br>An exploit, quite simply, is using a bug in the game to your advantage. Most of them are obvious: attacking NPCs that are stuck, or the ability to duplicate items or money. But we do realize it's not always easy to tell. <br><br>To this end it has been and will continue to be our policy to warn people when they are caught exploiting. It basically works like this: <br><br>1. You are caught exploiting, you receive a warning and the exploit is explained to you.<br>2. You are caught exploiting again (this includes either literally being caught or caught and we have evidence you were aware it was an exploit -- in other words, premeditated exploiting) and you are suspended for a period of time.<br>3. You are caught exploiting yet again -- you are banned. <br><br>A second issue that's arisen is the question: why do we care if people are exploiting? Are we just upset they're not playing the game the way we wanted them to? <br><br>The answer is honestly "no, that has nothing to do with it." The following is an email and my reply to it which I think more clearly explains why we cannot allow bug exploitation in EverQuest: <br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>From: Robert Mayer <br>Sent: Tuesday, June 12, 2001 7:30 AM<br>To: bmcquaid@verant.com<br>Subject: Question <br><br><b>You guys seem to be holding players responsible for doing things the game allows but you don't intend to happen. You are labeling as "exploits" anything that is possible, but doesn't fit into the game as you designed it. </b><br><br>Then I guess I failed to communicate the issues very effectively, because that is absolutely NOT what we're doing. We are labeling exploits as we always have, that being using bugs to your advantage in-game. Conquest used spell stacking bugs to their advantage and they used a safe zone (an area where a pathing bug made it such that an NPC wouldn't pursue those it was mad at) to their advantage.<br><br><br><b>Now correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that in effect you're saying "look, we aren't perfect, we can't code a game that is 100% free of loopholes because nobody can, but you should as players be able to infer what we intend, and if you do things that are clearly going against our intent, that's an exploit and you'll be disciplined." </b><br><br>Yes and no. We're saying that taking advantage of bugs is NOT ok. And we're saying that 1. knowing you're exploiting a bug and 2. where and to what end your exploiting, are both factors in determining how we react to a player or players who are exploiting. <br><br><br><b>Whew. I've never heard a game company essentially say that the players are responsible for the developer's programming, design, and implementation errors. No offense, because I realize it's a bitch to run a game like EQ, but it seems absurd to me to expect players to do anything but try their utmost to use every single tool you give them, deliberately or accidentally, to succeed. After all, the only point of EQ, beyond chatting, is to level up, and the only rewards beyond the social come from leveling up and killing things. You put umpteen thousand people into a world and tell them "go forth and kill MOBs," and by gum they're gonna do it. You can't reasonably then expect them to adhere to something like "oh, and only kill MOBs the way we intend for you to kill them!" </b><br><br>No, they're responsible for not taking advantage of bugs in-between the time they're discovered and when we have a chance to fix them. And we've always had this policy. UO certainly has this policy, and I think AC does to an extent now. And I'd submit the majority of persistent, massively multiplayer community based games in the future will have these policies. Why? Well, because what you do in a community based game like this affects other players. If you take advantage of a dupe bug, you can hurt the economy, and ruin the play experience of hundreds if not thousands of other players. If you take advantage of a pathing bug and kill a monster to obtain loot that you really shouldn't be able to, then the guy who did work harder to obtain that same loot without exploiting is not going to feel very entertained. Rather, he's going to feel frustrated and perhaps even regret that he did it the 'right way'. It's the same as in real life -- society is generally NOT ok with taking short cuts (especially at the expense of others). Insider Trading is not ok. Cutting through a parking lot to avoid traffic is not ok. Embezzling and stealing and cheating to advance oneself at the expense of others is NOT ok. And so why the heck should it be ok in the communities and societies that are being developed in online computer games? Because it's a game? Does my sense of accomplishment and are my feelings about right and wrong somehow less valid inside a virtual reality than they are in the real world? <br><br>No man is an island, and that includes a person in Norrath.<br><br><br><b>From reading all of the public info on the Conquest incident, it seems to me that these guys simply took advantage of holes your programmers left in the game. If an NPC can't summon or move for X seconds or due to Y geometry, um, tough titty to you, Kitty--fix it. If you leave it in, you can't ethically blame someone for taking advantage of it. It's your responsibility, and you'rs (Verant's) alone, to make the game unexploitable. </b><br><br>Agreed to a point, and expanding on that, it's Verant's responsibility to make sure we are offering an entertaining and fair play environment for our customers. And so we fix bugs, and we also crack down on players who would use bugs to cheapen the playing experience of others.<br><br>And I disagree it's unethical to blame a player for taking advantage of a bug. If a person leaves the door open at their place of business, thereby creating a hole in the company's security, yes, it's the person's fault for doing this. But that doesn't mean it's ok for someone to come along and enter the building, taking advantage of the open door. He gets blamed too.<br><br><br><b>Now, if players change the code, hack it, or abuse other players, disciplinary action seems warranted. But to even bother suspending players whose only real "crime" seems to be to take advantage of coding problems on your end--well, you're asking way too much of your customers. </b><br><br>But taking advantage of coding or data problems can in some cases ABUSE OTHER PLAYERS, which is the point I apparently failed miserably to communicate, because it keeps coming up, not just in your email but in others.<br><br><br><b>Once you create the world, it isn't yours any more, just like when a novelist writes a book. If someone wants to interpret The Stand as an allegory about French cooking, there's nothing Stephen King can do about it. Yeah, an online game isn't as passive as a book, but it's the same concept. You guys seem to be holding on way too tight. Who cares if they "exploit" the flaws in the programming? Turn off the zone, fix the flaws, and go on. Every single exploit you guys identify should be seen as an opportunity to improve the game or refine it--that's good, and it's your right. But to discipline players for finding your mistakes&#8230; man, that's pretty low. </b><br><br>Again, reading a book is not a shared, community based experience. Misinterpreting a book, and for a better analogy, cheating in a single player game does NOT hurt the play experience for others. But, and this is the key point here, cheating in a shared community based online experience DOES. <br><br>thanks,<br><br>-- <br>--------------------------------------------- <br>Brad McQuaid <br>Vice President, Premium Games <br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive <br>---------------------------------------------</UL>

Banegrivm Shadowblight sends us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>For some time now there have been strange occurrences happening about the <br>lands of Norrath as we know of it.

Through rain, snow, sleet and rain (not to mention server problems) we present to you today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000180.html"><b>Spelling Errors</b></a><br>First, I want to thank all of you that have been sending in spelling errors. I have a few comments to make about some of the types of comments we've been getting. <br><br>A few people have pointed out that when you use the Hail feature, it creates a sentence like: "Hail Bob." Such a sentence should, we admit, have a comma after the word hail. It should read: "Hail, Bob." <br><br>Unfortunately, changing that would be a real problem. NPCs are trained (through expensive drug therapy) to respond to the existing text, without the comma. Retraining them (which would probably mean intensive electric shock therapy) would require that we change every NPC that responds to that hail text. While perhaps a worthwhile endeavor, we have decided that the grammatical headaches that this causes some people doesn't warrant the time needed to make the change, and the likely bugs and broken quests that would occur. Sorry, but it's going to stay as it is. <br><br>Also, we've had a lot of comments about things on the character creation screens. Those have to be changed by programmers, not designers. We've created an extensive list of changes needed, and the programmers will be fixing them when they get the odd spare moment. That's just going to take time to finish, since it seems more worthwhile to have the programmers working on other things most of the time. <br><br>Otherwise, we are tackling the spelling errors as they come in. Many of the ones you've sent in are already fixed. Thanks for the help in this.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000071.html"><b>Quivers</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The code that makes different kinds of arrows feed into the ammo slot from a quiver doesn't currently work.

This is also a test server which means that there is no customer service on this server. This is different than most people are used to. <br><br>What does this mean? It means that /petitions are not going to be answered unless they are about a bug, it means that there is no one to give last names, no one to get involved in player disputes. <br><br>This means if your name if offensive it will be changed without warning and your account may have action taken against it. Please do not make vulgar names. If your name is changed arguing will not help as this is a test server that will be wiped soon. <br><br>We also ask that you not sent tells concerning these things to our testers. They are not allowed to help you with these issues. <br><br>We appreciate all the help we get testing this code, but please remember that we are here to test and that is our primary responsibility. My testers are very limited on what they can do for customers. <br><br>I look forward to seeing you there! <br><br>Ester <br>--------------------------------------<br><br>And also keep in mind that our Development Team is spending a lot of time on this server, both playing and working. And we're just as willing to issue warnings and change names as anyone. Yes, being a jerk on the Test Server can earn you a warning or suspension just like it can on any other server. I've encountered a lot of nice folks (even a few of those that killed me this weekend were very nice about it&#8230;). But I've also run into some folks with some very foul mouths. Keep in mind that I'm very willing to petition people and send their information over to our Customer Service folks&#8230; <br><br>And please, please report any bugs you find using /bug. Be detailed in your description. We're concentrating on bugs regarding the new code on this server. <br><br>I've also encountered a lot of people that didn't know the rules for the new server. I'm not sure what good it will do posting a note here, since those that didn't read the original rules post will probably not see this either, but please read the rules before logging on. <br><br>Alan<br><br>---------<br><br>Sir_Yakk wrote: <br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just so people know:<br>If you get 'name rejected', this is either because the name was rejected, or because you are trying to make a 2nd character. <br><br>Heh. <br><br>You might want to change the message you get when you want to make a 2nd character.

Why? ]</i></font><br><br>I agree, I expect there to be a fewer grief players when the server goes live. The freedom given by knowing that your character will be gone soon anyway makes people less concerned about their reputation. <br><br>No, the names need to be one color. We certainly talked about this, and I know why we can't make them different colors. Did you know that wood elves can be evil? Most people don't. Imagine being a wood elf and trying to visit your trainer with a big red name over your head. <br><br>My neutral dark elf has been attacked no less than fifteen times in Nektulos (oddly, I've been attacked more there than in Freeport&#8230;). Without an obvious name color, it's going to be very, very hard to play a character that isn't of the same religion as the majority of his peers. Giving them obvious team designations would make playing them impossible. <br><br>And we want to encourage people to respond to each other based on the character as much as their team. Having a gank me sign on your head doesn't really make for a better roleplaying environment&#8230; <br><br><br>A_Slayer_Of_Aradune wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First, let me say thanks for Sullon-Zek. So far it has been a blast and hopefully will only continue to improve once it goes live. However, after testing it these past few days I have noticed a quite disturbing trend, evil diety immunity. To put it bluntly, their is just too much evil, and on top of that concern, evil races such as Trolls, Ogres and in particular Iksars that have absolutely no concerns about being accousted for some time. I'm not posting this concerb because I feel good or even neutral aligned dietys should have an edge. However, I am concerned that too many subscribers will start as Troll, Ogre or Iksar because of thier relative immunity to attack or invasion. Think of it, no Troll, ogre or Iksar has to worry when they see a player of thier own race. Is this balance? Also, many of the better dungeons will be evil aligned dominated due to geography and the afformentioned dilemna. Not only is good severly hindered by this, but neutral too. Players will realize the easiest routes and most will head in that direction. And that direction is clearly evil. <br><br>I'm not implying VI should severely gimp evil. However, I am asking that the developers look into this and give serious consideration into introducing a neutral strain of Troll, Ogre and Iksar. Perhaps a neutral Shaman diety for all. Furthermore, moving one more diety to the good end of things may also add to the servers playability and resolve the evil immunity syndrom that may ultimately cripple the server. I only post this because I feel this would be best for the overall playability of Sullen-Zek and give the evil races something to think about. Something every good or neutral race has to deal with. Enemies in their own towns and a potential enemies in the same race. Otherewise, we may ultimately have an evil pvp server where no one actually fights. Thanks ]</i></font><br><br>That same immunity also leads to a few disadvantages. For example, if I see an iksar, I know he's evil. If I see a human I'll have to /con him to see what he is. So the same races that might have it easier because they are all on the same team, will find that any sort of stealth stuff isn't going to be useful. <br><br>You might be right, it might end up being that evil rules the server, and that the good folks are forced to work out alliances with the neutral ones to help survive. That's fine. Heck, that sounds very interesting. But it might also be true that a lot of people want to play good characters, and that the ease of finding and distinguishing evil targets is a burden on them. <br><br>The actual politics of the server will have to fall into place as it plays out. That's pretty thrilling, really. You might be right, but whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for the server as a whole, nobody really knows yet. <br><br>Niccy wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Something slightly odd here... <br><br>Ester- ...What does this mean?

Keep in mind that I'm very willing to petition people ... <br><br>Who's going to read those petitions? And is trash-talking allowed on this server or not? ]</i></font><br><br>I meant to say that I'd /report people. Remember, those reports are filed. So even if there is nobody to petition to, there will be a record. That means that if someone else petitions the same player for foul language, my report is still on file, adding to the evidence. And, well, I work here. So if someone is offensive enough, I can walk over and talk to someone about getting action taken&#8230; <br><br>Sure, trash talk is cool. At least trash talk in the sporting sense. But foul language is never going to be acceptable in EverQuest. If your character hates my character, that's fine. But if your character uses foul language to express that hatred, you can expect to find that the player is the one that gets warned. I've had interactions with people on that server that already that were hostile in character and pleasant out of character. That makes the thing fun. Making it personal ruins the game. <br><br>Enivri wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Well Absor/Ester have posted another thing about the new test server, but I have YET to see this issue discussed: Rogue Pickpocketing.

Is not selling someone a SoW potion the same thing as paying someone to cast sow on you? Also, I think you underestimate the number of people with multiple accounts. Heck, I know that if *I* built up a character on another team to the 50's and wanted to start a newbie, I'd certainly give it stuff, just because I can. <br><br>From a gameplay standpoint, I think you're missing a wonderful dynamic that preventing inter-team trades would create. If there is a certain item that is considered "great" (such as E-boots), a team can literally prevent other teams from getting them. The dynamic is jealousy. With enough cash, a player could ply an item off of an opponent. But without inter-team trading, that person (and others like him) would be jealous of that race. That creates even more conflict. ]</i></font><br><br>And on the other hand, there are some interesting possibilities that not allowing trading would restrict. In fact, in your example, imagine the wealth that can be gained by a team that is able to corner the market on something and then sell it. It also allows players to set up some of their own events, like convincing the evil guild leader to give up some item to a neutral guild to prevent them from aiding a good guild in some action. <br><br>I can see both sides here, and I can't see one as clearly better, except in one way. Sometimes it's just plain better to be able to help someone out. So if a neutral character sees a good character that has lost all of his stuff, he can help that person out a bit. I think that's the reason that I'm in favor of allowing trades across teams.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000201.html"><b>Slammin'</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: About the large races not having the ability to slam when in skeleton form - that is true of the other forms also. <br><br>As a barbarian warrior - I cannot slam when a group member gives me wolf or werewolf form. <br><br>Fre ]</i></font><br><br>That's true. But that's not an issue. Those spells always did that. The issue here is that we would be changing the functionality of an existing spell (adding a cool look, but adding a restriction). That would be why adding a new spell would be best. The new spell would still prevent slam, because that's what those sorts of spells do. But the old spell wouldn't be changed (ruined, in the minds of some players).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>Pets and Spells</b></a><br>Halbarad wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I'd like to point out that this doesn't make any sense within the gameworld mechanics that I am aware of. <br><br>Invisibility has one effect, and one effect only: It prevents you from being added to a creature's hate list by moving close to it. (i.e. makes all creatures that don't see invisible indifferent to you). It does NOT prevent you from being added to the hate list for other reasons, nor does it remove you from the hate list if you are already on it. <br><br>Having your pet attack a creature adds aggro towards the caster; if it didn't, a monster wouldn't come after you if you had your pet attack it and your pet died. Being invisible will in no way protect you from the monster that just killed your pet, because you are on it's hate list, and it will find you and attack you. <br><br>So, insofar as I understand it, the above explanation doesn't hold water. Now, if you don't want someone to be able to travel invisibly with a pet, that's fine - just say so - but let's not have some confused explanation that makes it sound like aggro works differently than has always been demonstrated. <br><br>Oh... and as an aside, if, for some bizarre reason, you do happen to allow invisible casters with pets, could you make it so that /pet get lost breaks charm? Thanks. :)]</i></font><br><br>That is true, now. But back then invisibility, if cast before the pet attacked, would prevent you from getting onto the hate list of the NPC. So with the NPC targeted and the caster sitting out of sight, the caster could send pets in for as long as his or her mana held out. Both invisibility and the way pets work were changed because of exploits like that. It may be true that neither you nor I can think of any specific exploits that would come from reverting this. But I'm pretty convinced that some would crop up. <br><br>It works fine as it is now. The only reason to change it would be to reduce the thought required for pet casters (Should I cast now, or wait until we're further along? Will casting now cause me too much trouble?). The ability to know when to cast a pet is important to the smart pet caster, and can distinguish a well played magician from a poorly played one (though obviously less so that the ability to successfully command you pet). With the ability to summon your pet, I don't really see any need to change the way this works, and certainly not at the risk of a potential exploit. <br><br>Charm is a separate matter. Get lost doesn't break the charm because the pet can't choose to break the charm, you have to do that with the spells provided you.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Class Questions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: since your on the topic of classes... <br><br>Why cant iksar be rogues?

I see no reason why they cant be rogues; the whole 'too primitive' argument goes out the window, because barbarians can be them and they are much more primitive then iksar, since they cannot harness intelligence(sorry for the bad spelling people) based magics. <br><br>Also, is there any chance, that with upcoming expansions( not luclin per se) that you will be adding new classes to the already existing races that they couldnt have been before?(ie making it so dark elves can be monks, or something along that lines) (well, maybe not darkies becoming monks...but you get my point).

It appears one public statement wasn't enough to clear the waters for Verant regarding a controversial decision to disband and suspend an entire guild.  In public statement #2, EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid talks more on the issue and provides what only can be described as a monstor of an email discussion between him and the Guild's leader.  Here's the first part of the document:<UL>Hello,<br><br>After our first statement regarding the Conquest guild issue, several things happened. First, I began a dialog with two members of Conquest (the leader and an officer). Second, I began a very detailed investigation of what occurred. Third, the public interest in this situation continued with both public posts and well as emails to various Verant employees. <br><br>The following is a lengthy email exchange between me and the two guild members, and I'm releasing it (with their permission) as sort of a 'second, more definitive statement', in that much of the feedback we received and read indicated that many players were not satisfied with the depth (or lack thereof) of our original statement. That and, after further investigation on my part, there were a few errors in the original statement I wanted to clear up.<br><br>I think these various emails explain in detail both Verant's position and Conquest's regarding this issue. They are presented 'as is', except for spelling fixes and the deletion of email addresses and guild member names. Also, the last couple of emails between us are omitted in that they deal with some other issues not really related to what happened.<br><br>In any case, I hope this clears some things up and helps and doesn't merely 'throw more fuel on the fire'. I leave it to all of you to come to your own conclusions, but at least you have details on both sides of the issue as well as a good faith effort from both parties to get to the bottom of this situation. <br><br>--<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>Brad McQuaid<br>Vice President, Premium Games<br>Sony Online Entertainment/Verant Interactive<br>---------------------------------------------</UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000210.html">Click here</a> to read the very, very long email conversation had between Brad and the guild's leader.

The children were obviously children; they were all playing big hulking warriors with Pokemon names. Some fellow saw them playing in the dungeon then ran off. He came back about 5 minutes later and offered to show them into a secret section of the dungeon. This section was much more difficult than the rest of the dungeon. He led the children down into it and they were lulled by the fact that there were no monsters. He had killed them all before bringing the children down. Then he went to great lengths to lead the children in circles so that they were lost and then quietly left just as the dungeon refilled with monsters. <br><br>----------------<br><br><a href="http://www.fanstory.com/fanmag/">The Online Magazine</a><br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Lava</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Because this spell is normally cast in an emergency when things are going badly the additional mana drain just adds to whatever frustration you already had over things going badly. <br><br>So is this a bug, or a 'feature'?

X is a modifier based on class. 2 for wizards, 1 for other classes (if crit hits are not wizard only). <br><br>When a spell is cast get a random number 1-100. If this number is less than the base number a crit hit occurs. When a crit hit occurs, there is no chance for resist and the spell does (base - rand number) extra damage. <br><br>This will max out at about 50% chance if the caster is using their most recently obtained spells. <br><br>Here are a few comments on the idea:<br>1. Max base number is 50. Therefore max crit hit is 150% of norm and max chance for crit is 50%. <br><br>2. Creatures 10 levels higher than caster can not be crit hit. <br><br>3. Creatures over the 6 lvl limit, but under the 10 lvl crit limit can only be hit if a spell crits. <br><br>4. Agro is counted the same as if spell didn't crit. <br><br>5. Research is included to represent that a good researcher would have superiour knowledge of both the mob and the spell. <br><br>6. Crit hits would show up in battle text, just like warrior crit hits do. <br><br>7. Perhaps, the base should be modified for different zones or continents. This could be a way to help balance the classes in different continents. The 50% damage bonus could vary from zone to zone, but I wouldn't make it too high. <br><br>8. It should be noticibly better for wizards, if not wizard only. <br><br>9. Resistant chance reduction is a critical aspect of this idea. <br><br>10.

While I appreciate the feedback, I'm going to ask that you please stop asking for more locations, and simply let the world unfold around you. <br><br>Thanks <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-------------------------------------<br><br>Guys, we're doing this the way you're always asking us to do it, with in-game plot.

Yes, we actually thought this all through&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Design Balance</b></a><br>Kione wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I've actually found the whole idea of a Cleric/Druid/Shaman thing to be fairly interesting, and it actually shows quite a bit more depth than one might otherwise think. To preface, let me outline what races can be which classes: <br><br>Cleric: Dark Elf, Dwarf, Erudite, Gnome, Halfling, High Elf, Human<br>Druid: Half-Elf, Halfling, Human, Wood Elf<br>Shaman: Barbarian, Iksar, Ogre, Troll <br><br>So anyway, there are a few things we can infer from this, I think. We can note the following: <br><br>1) All races have at least one sort of Wisdom caster. Some races don't have Int casters (Barbarians, Dwarves, Wood Elves, Halflings, Ogres, Trolls, Half-Elves,) but religion is esential. <br>2) The Shaman class is exclusive of both Clerics and Druids (ie, no race can be both a Shaman and a Cleric or Druid.) <br>3) The Druid class is compatable with the Clerics only in two races: Humans and Halflings. All the other races are one or the other. <br><br>The way I see it, there are three religious approaches, and these approaches are not terribly compatable. We have a sort of a stylized and organized worship of a god, that's the way of the Cleric (note the sophistication of just about all the temples.) On the other side, we have a rough, primal embracing of the god and his beleifs, the Shaman. For a Druid, I think that the god is secondary to the worship of Nature itself, thus being limited to the two gods who typify Nature: the one who gives birth, or the one who nurtures life, Tunare and Karana. <br><br>So clearly, Clerics and Shamans require a wholey different way of thinking, and such a thing will never appear in the same race. The closest we get are Humans, Erudites, and Barbarians, who are all the same species, but are very different "breeds." Should the Iksar race manage to regain its heights, then probably the Shamanistic way of thought would dissappear from them completely. Or perhaps some sect of the Iksar would cling to the old ways, at the cost of not embracing the newer way of living (and hence be a different "race," much like Humans and Barbarians or Wood Elves and High Elves.) <br><br>On a related note, I might add that Druidic and Clerical thought are also radically different, and as such are only accessable by the most open minded and flexable of races (humans and their diminutive mirror.) ]</i></font><br><br>That's a fair analysis. Heck, sounds like you might have pulled that from some old EverQuest design document. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000180.html"><b>Misspellings</b></a><br>SirReal wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As I have said before, I am pretty sure the "Skeleton Llrod" in Befallen is a "Skeleton Lord"]</i></font> <br><br>I forgive you for your misconception. :)<br><br>That's the guy's name.

Healing works across all level ranges (within your team), including resurrection.

At that time the only source of shark meat on Norrath was living sharks with sharp teeth. The quest rewards were balanced based on the facts of the day. <br><br>Recently we added a bunch of new recipes for bakers. Shark meat was used in one (or some) of those recipes. So shark meat was added on a vendor or two to facilitate the use of that recipe. <br><br>This made the original quest extremely easy for people that could transport themselves. People used this fact to gain rewards beyond the intended difficulty of the quest. <br><br>Sure, we should have caught it. But with the huge number of quests and the large increase in baking recipes and items, we missed it. To fix this we had, really, two choices. Remove the quest or remove the meat from vendors. <br><br>We chose to remove the meat. Bakers don't suffer in their ability to make skill, there are other recipes that will get them through those skill ranges. All this does is make shark dishes a rarity, and that's actually something that I think is a good thing. If someone gives you food with shark meat in it, you know that they've gone to some trouble to make that food.<br><br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000204.html"><b>Pet Questions</b></a><br>pyrian wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Greetings, <br><br>I wasn't sure if this was ever brought up, but I just wanted to address it anyway in case it wasn't. I've just recently started a necro character a couple of months ago who is already level 32. As of now, my character has reached the level in which a pet is essential for survival. This means that if I wish to survive an encounter, my pet has to be able to survive the fight. Likewise, to have my pet to survive, it must be able to effectively deal with any mob that it encounters. And to do that, the pet usually has to be armed. <br><br>So my question is this, are there any plans to have necro pets return the weapons it was given when you no longer need the pet? Also, are there any plans to let necro retrieve the weapons given to their pets if their pets die? I think that it would be a great addition, espeically since the necro's primary mode of defense and offense are their pets. Please let us know what you think. Thanks. ]</i></font><br><br>Arming your pet is part of the bargain for using them. Losing that weapon is part of the cost. In a way, this is another one of the slight and perhaps subtle advantages that magicians have over other pet classes, as they can summon weapons for their pets. <br><br>No, we have no intention of allowing pets to return weapons. <br><br>Silfox wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: JanePetOwner casts Invisibility on herself, and Jobober panics and goes poof. Shouldn't it be possible for the caster to cast See Invisible on the pet, then invis herself without the pet suiciding? ]</i></font><br><br>The pet goes away when the owner disappears for game balance reasons as much as for any roleplaying reason. Unfortunately an invisible pet owner could, basically, send an endless chain of pets at an NPC and never be at risk themselves. I mentioned this to Kendrick and he remembered a time in beta when a 15th level character was able to use this trick to easily take on a 28th level NPC with no risk. <br><br>So, yes, it would make sense that if the pet is freaking out and disappearing when the master disappears, then casting See Invisible on the pet would prevent that. But we can't allow pets to be attached to invisible masters for reasons having nothing to do with 'realism' and everything to do with gameplay.</UL>

We don't talk about such changes simply because we want you to expect NPCs to change. We aren't announcing changes that might raise Emperor Crush's hit points, we're not in the habit of announcing changes to Cazic either. Only in the case where the change is rather huge will be make an announcement about it. Revamping the whole zone needs to be announced. Changing some stats doesn't. <br><br>Honestly, we make far too many changes to NPCs to announce them all. Hopefully you understand why this isn't the kind of question I'll answer. <br><br>But the team did see it, I talked to them about it, and if this had been a bug or something, we would have dealt with it.

I can't nail down if you guys ever said what exactly kind of stuff it can summon, but I was told (and it can be logically deduced) that you can only summon creatures that spawn in that zone. This makes ottal sense from what we have been told by you guys about the "Global File" thingy that hold all models that can be displayed in a zone. So back o my question, why is it that it doesn't seem to be true? For instance, my wife is a lvl 43 mage so when we hunt together she likes to use the monster pets because they are more fun to look at and illicit some hilarious responses from other PCs. Well since the spell came out I have noticed that occasionally she gets a critter that doesn't even spawn close to that zone. Such as: a jungle spider summoned from EC, a fungus man summoned in Rathe Mountains, a spiderling summoned in Sol A, etc. Why are these critters in the zone file if they don't ever appear? Is it like some "reserved for future use" thing? I don't mind it I am just curious. I mean someone purposely put these things on the list, right? Seems like these critters could be taken out to make room for some of the other in-zone critters. Like why can you never summon a wurm pet in GD? or a Frost Giant? Being as the Moster Summoning spells are purely "fun" spells (ie-they offer no real tactical advantage), there's no harm in letting us know how it works right? Of course I can see some tactical advantage on PvP servers. I notice a lot of people will stop and try to attack the pet because they think it is attacking the mage. On PvP seems this'd be a great bait and switch tactic, let someone think they will get the killing blow and loot you only to find it was a trap... Anyhoo, if you could answer my question I'd be appreciative =0) Oh and can you please tell Dan to put in a recipe for Malted Milk Balls?

Legal means it's an endorsed tactic, whereas "not illegal" just means that we won't get involved in these player matters. I fully expect the player community to develop a set of their own accepted rules on the server. I expect to see all of the things that are currently "illegal" on the other servers become "frowned upon" by the players of Sullon Zek.

The Sullon Zek server, the first Deity Team server in EverQuest's history, was officially announced by Alan in a very big update on the Developer's Corner.  Here's the entire post:<UL>Hello everyone. I've got some news for you that I'm sure you'll like.<br><br>We plan to have the new PvP Deity Teams server up and running some time tomorrow. I also have the name of the new server and the basic rule set for you below.<br><br>What we'll be doing is putting the new server up as a Test server for a short while, a few weeks or it may only be a few days, depending on how things go. In order to play on the server during the testing period you'll have to log in using testeverquest.exe. At the end of the test period we will be wiping all characters from the new server in order to restart it as a Live server.<br><br>The server will be open to anyone that wants to help us test it. You'll have to understand that the standard Test Server disclaimers will apply (see the note below). And our Development Team and Testing Teams will be running around on the server. Please cooperate with them and don't bother them with requests. <br><br>Please use /bug to tell us about any bugs you find with the new rules and PvP code.<br><br>Remember, this is a Test server, and there is no promise of customer service.<br><br>Don't let any of that intimidate you if you want to test out the new rules once we get the server up. Just run testeverquest.exe and start up a character.<br><br>Anyway, on to the rules. This isn't necessarily a final list, we are still thinking of adding and modifying some rules. But this is a pretty good summary.<br><br>----<br><br>Welcome to Sullon Zek, the first Deity Team PvP server.<br><br><b>Important Notice:</b><i><br><br>This server will only be featured on the Test EQ Patch for some time for testing purposes. You will need to run testeverquest.exe to access this server. While this server is featured on the Test Patch, all the conditions that apply to the Test Server also apply to this server. There may be cases where the server comes down multiple times a day for updates. There is also a small chance of corpse or item loss. There will be very little to no initial customer service support. When testing of this server is complete and the server is ready to be introduced to the Live Servers, all characters will be wiped. Below are the new rules specific to this server. But also be aware that these rules may be changed as we feel the need to adjust them.</I><br><br><br>The Sullon Zek server is a new server with a new rule set. The rules for this server are very different than those on any other EverQuest server. In general the server is based on the concept of a PvP teams server, like Tallon and Vallon Zek, but with the teams chosen based on which god the character worships rather than the race of the character.<br><br>This document includes the PvP rules for Sullon Zek, and a list of the teams for the server. The 'teams' will be referred to as 'alliances' in this document, as they represent an alliance of the gods, rather than some sort of sports team&#8230;<br><br><br><b>Sullon Zek rules:</b><br><br>1. Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance. But rules 2 and 3 apply.<br><br>2. Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled.<br><br>3. Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.<br><br>4. Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.<br><br>5. Players may only have one character at a time on this server. This means that you will have to delete the existing character in order to create a new one. Because we are introducing a new class and a new race with the release of Shadows of Luclin we plan to make allowances at that time for those that wish to explore these new characters.<br><br>6. Characters will not be able to group with anyone that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>7. Characters will not be able to invite someone to join their guild that is not on their Deity Team.<br><br>8. Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level.<br><br>9. Resistance debuff spells have a 50% increased effectiveness against player characters.<br><br>10. /consider returns only three kinds of results when used against player characters. 'Green' means that the character is below your range. 'White' or 'black' means that the character is within your range. 'Red' means that they are above your range. 'In range' means +/- 5 levels.<br><br>11. /consider will also display a message indicating what team the target is on. Members of your own team will be displayed as an 'ally', members of another team will be shown as 'threateningly'.<br><br>12. Faction hits for PvP will be taken for killing characters within their racial home towns. Killing a human in any human starting city will cause a faction loss with the locals. Freeport, Qeynos and Surefall Glade are considered starting cities for humans. All of Greater Faydark and Felwithe are considered the starting city for all elves (high elves, wood elves and half elves), except dark elves. Paineel and Erudin are both starting cities for erudites, and killing one in either city (regardless of their place of origin) will result in a faction loss with that city. Other cities are not considered home towns, despite being run and controlled by a certain race. For example, HighHold is not a human home town. Thurgadin is not a dwarven home town.<br><br>13. Rules such as the Play Nice Policy do not apply to this server. Characters have the ability on these servers to deal with their conflicts through combat. Causing experience loss by 'training' NPCs on other characters is not an offense that would warrant a warning on PvP servers. HOWEVER: All rules regarding general decency still apply. Cursing, threats and other such things will be dealt with sternly, and are still unacceptable behavior on PvP servers.<br><br>14. Beneficial effects can not be used on members of another team.<br><br>15. No character will be able to bind in dungeon zones.<br><br>16. Beneficial spells will not affect characters more than 20 levels lower than the spell level. Existing spell restrictions on spells over 50th level will supercede this rule.<br><br>17. There will be 'insignia' dropped on the corpses of characters over 20th level that are killed by another character. We plan to allow those to be turned in for a reward of some sort. What that reward will be is undetermined at this time, but we are leaning towards a team reward rather than a personal reward.<br><br><br><b>The 'Teams':</b><br><br>The Good Alliance consists of: Erollisi Marr, Mithaniel Marr, Rodcet Nife, Quellious, Tunare <br>The Evil Alliance consists of: Bertoxxulous, Cazic Thule, Innoruuk, Rallos Zek<br>The Neutral Alliance consists of: Brell Serilis, Bristlebane, Karana, Prexus, Solusek Ro, The Tribunal, Veeshan.<br><br><br>There are no Agnostics on Sullon Zek. With the new influence of the gods, those that had not declared for one deity or another have been killed. Everyone now worships a deity, if not out of respect, love or fear of the god, then out of fear for their lives at the hands of fanatics.<br><br>Barbarian Shaman and Warriors can choose to worship Mithaniel Marr. Mithaniel Marr was unwilling to abandon all of the noble barbarians that served the good, and many declared themselves in favor of an alliance with Good.<br><br>Monks will be able to worship Veeshan.

Another major incident involving reported GM abuse has rocked the EverQuest community.  Vanamar has a report summing up the guild's version of the story:<BLOCKQUOTE>The Sleeper has been Awakened on Lanys...<br><br>.... and the guild responsible is disbanded, and 30 members suspended.<br> <br>On the evening of Monday, June 4, 2001, Lanys T`Vyl's local "uberguild"<br>invaded sleepers tomb with a force 30 strong.<br> <br>The proceeded down to the Warders area, where four dragons are<br>usually posted to keep watch over the Sleeper, aka Kerafyrm, lest<br>he be unleashed upon the world.<br> <br>Conquest had defeated the first three warders that Saturday,<br>and waited to attempt the fourth warder because their force<br>had grown weary and needed rest.<br> <br>After entering the dungeon and making their way down to<br>the fourth warder, they assaulted him in full force.  They<br>had the dragon beaten down, halfway to his death, but<br>the unexpected suddenly happened...<br> <br>The Sleeper awoke.<br> <br>As the army of Conquest was in the process of slaying the<br>Warder, The Sleeper proceeded to slay him outright, and<br>then began assaulting the members of Conquest.<br> <br>Conquest was eventually defeated, and were recuperating,<br>when the emissaries of the gods arrived, and stated :<br> <br>'Everyone that is in this zone, has a corpse in this zone,<br>or was involved in the invasion of this zone is receiving a<br>warning for Exploitation.'<br> <br>The guild was summarily summoned to the area known as<br>"Arena", and was told that everyone involved was being<br>suspended, and their guild disbanded.<br> <br>Suddenly, they found themselves removed from the world,<br>and could no longer inhabit the bodies they had worked<br>so hard on improving.<br> <br>You can find more news at:<br> <br><a href="http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz">http://eqconquest.inet.net.nz</a><br> <br>- Vanamar Dz`Baernon, 51st Circle Elementalist<br>- Officer of Eternal Sinn, Lanys T`Vyl Server</BLOCKQUOTE>Brad McQuaid, on behalf of Sony, fired back with <a href="http://lumthemad.net/forums/showflat.php?Cat=&Board=comments&Number=14692&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&o=7&part=all&vc=1">an official statement</a> on Lum's forum.  Here's an excerpt from that post:<UL>On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating, they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got caught. <br><br>While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z" coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not able to fight back. </UL>As you know, I dislike tackling GM abuse stories on the frontpage because most the time we can never seem to get to the truth.  Keeping this in mind, I will not be covering this event any further <i>unless</I> something extremely important arises from this incident.  For readers who wish to find out more, this report has provided both sides of the story with links to find out more information from each source.

The latest updates from Alan can be read here in today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar Background</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Actually, the reason I always felt Iksar had shaman instead of clerics was because they were tradtionalists and really do not like change. While they are really no longer a "shamanistic" society, they still cling to their old religion and beliefs. Also, it seems they practice ancestral worship, which would mean communing with the spirits of their ancestors which would again encourage them not to make the change to clerics. <br><br>I have gatherd Iksar society is not chaotic at all, on the contrary it's very, very rigid and organized and fear driven. Do what your told or die sort of thing, and it's a very military like in structure. Your role is determined before you are born, you never question the mystics as they are the mouthpiece of Cazic-Thule and to question Cazic-Thule is to ensure your own death and also bring death to your fellows, as punishment for allowing you to question him. Which encourages them to actively try and destroy those who WOULD question Cazic-Thule, thus preventing any worship besides him. <br><br>Well, I'm really too tired to detail my other speculations about Iksar society and their religion, if you ever want to chat Absor just send me a tell, I greatly enjoy discussing the Iksar and everything about them. <br><br>Zildrax Shathrais<br>High-Mystic of Cazic-Thule<br>Morell Thule Server ]</i></font><br><br>That sounds like a good depiction of the Iksar. <br><br>As for the whole Cleric/Shaman thing, it is probably more accurate to describe their worship of Cazic-Thule as more spiritual, more objectified than, say, the way Dark Elves worship Innoruuk. A Dark Elf (if he was trying to be polite) might describe this kind of worship as unsophisticated. But that's not necessarily the case. It is, however, different and perhaps a little more primal. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hail Absor <br><br>Ripped straight from the everquest.com website, i have a piece of information that may shock and discredit you Absor! <br><br>/quote<br>evil hand of Innoruuk touched this land and spawned the Iksar, a powerful reptilian race<br>/quote <br><br>where did i find the pearl of knowledge? at this address:<br><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp">http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/atlas/kunark.jsp</a> <br><br>Absor, Cazic-thule is a big jerk! he keeps stealing Innoruuks worshippers.. or perhaps he just intimidates them into worshipping him. I am such a good spin doctor i think i should be doing Absor's job, i may have answered my own question! ]</i></font><br><br>More likely, someone just wrote the wrong blurb for the map page&#8230; :)<br><br>I'll ask someone to look into it and maybe we can polish that pearl a bit.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html"><b>Rallos Zek Faction Hits</b></a><br>Ok, I made an error. <br><br>The changes to faction hits for Rallos Zek will be going in with our next patch, not with this last one. This last patch was a minor thing that had only a few changes in it, and this was not one of them. <br><br>The King Tormax change did happen with this patch though.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000194.html"><b>Patch Message - Or Lack Thereof</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hello Absor, <br><br>Bored at work and noticed that there was no patch message listed on this board or under the website. I always look forward to patch messages..go figure. Was the patch delayed or was it just to small to post the changes? <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>Galadin Trenchant<br>42 Warrior]</i></font> <br><br>Sorry. There really was no patch message&#8230; Here's what's on the front page of everquest.com: <br><br>----------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Today's patch consisted only of server-side data, and does not contain anything that would normally be announced. <br>----------------------<br><br>That's pretty much it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Auto-play</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There is actually a better way to turn off the auto-play (known to the windows operating system as Auto-insert notification) <br><br>-Right-click on My Computer and click Properties<br>-Click the Device Manager tab<br>-You should now see a listing for CD Rom with a plus sign to the left of it. Click that plus sign<br>-There should now be listed at least one CD Rom drive. Select the one you wish to disable the autoplay function and click the properties button at the bottom of the list<br>-Click the settings tab. You should now be able to find a check box for Auto insert notification. Unclick that and hit OK a few times and you are done. <br><br>May take a few extra steps, but it saves you from the possibility of messing up anything in the file types.. and those can be a real pain to fix... <br><br>Elasah<br>52nd Dwarf Cleric of Brell Serilis<br>Terris-Thule server ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks! <br><br>I would recommend this method myself.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000183.html"><b>Spell Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: the Shaman Spell - Spirit Sight has No text displayed when you cast it on someone else, if you cast it on yourself you get a message "Your eyes tingle" but unless you're looking at the party member and they're facing you so you can see the little Eye Sparkle graphic, you have no way of knowing it took hold. <br><br>I think there is the same problem with the "see invisible" spell <br><br>Sylviania Delaforet<br>Pathfinder of Tunare ]</i></font><br><br>Noted.

Alan gave us some new information concerning the upcoming patch on the Developer's Corner:<UL>When we patch tomorrow (6-5-01), we will be introducing code on Rallos Zek server that will result in faction hits similar to those on the team servers.<br><br>Killing a character in any of their races home town will cause you to take a faction hit. This counts for all home cities. So, if you kill a Human in any of the city zones of Qeynos (or Freeport, or Surefall Glade), you will suffer a faction hit, even if that Human was born in Freeport. All of Greater Faydark is the starting city for Wood Elves. There will also be faction hits for killing High Elves and Half-Elves in Greater Faydark. Killing an Erudite in either Paineel or Erudin will cause a faction hit.<br><br>Also, for those of you trying to start or complete quests for King Tormax, you need to know that we've made a change. You will now need to be in good standing with him in order to do his quests. In game terms, this means you will need to be at least amiable.<br><br>Alan</UL>Visit the update by following <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000193.html">this link</a>.

After a restful weekend, Alan returned to the Developers Corner with several new updates:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000050.html"><b>Iksar and Religion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Okay, here's my question. It seems that the Iksar cannot be agnostic because they have a firm, unbending belief in Cazic-Thule. I can accept that. :-) But, it leaves me wondering why such a devout people have no clerics of their chosen deity. The Iksar society and history seems sophisticated enough to support clerics in their ranks, but yet they cannot follow that path. I was just wondering why that was. :-) <br><br>Kullom Faithforge<br>22nd Level Paladin of Brell<br>High Council of Faydwer<br>Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br>Perhaps in their past, at the height of their society they could indeed be clerics, I don't know. But now, despite their past, the Iksar are indeed a relatively unsophisticated society currently.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000182.html"><b>Mcicontrol</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If you want to disable Auto Play (took me about an hour to figure this out.. not to mention a lot of ejecting/reinserting the CD) <br><br>Pasted directly from Windows help: <br><br>Double-click My Computer. <br>On the View menu, click Folder Options, and then click the File Types tab. <br>Click AudioCD, and then click Edit. <br>In Actions, click Play, and then click Set Default. <br>Notes <br>You can temporarily disable AutoPlay by pressing SHIFT while you insert an audio CD. <br>Repeating steps 1 through 4 enables AutoPlay again. <br><br>And there you have it. I hope this helps everyone! <br><br>(who knew windows help was actually *useful*! ) <br><br>Delphi ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks for the tips. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have to retract part of my post. <br><br>The back and forward will not work because extra variables are required, and the current implementaion of /mcicontrol will not allow for variables (or I jsut havn't figured out what the variable is...) <br><br>So... :)<br><br>Sorry! but I did put in disclaimers :)<br><br>Grimone, Tunare ]</i></font><br><br>Thanks again. I thought I had heard that you couldn't do that&#8230; <br><br>And we both put in disclaimers. :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Just some more info: <br><br>I've found that in game, to play a CD, you must type: <br><br>/mcicontrol open cdaudio<br>/mcicontrol play cdaudio <br><br>But if that CD finishes playing, before I can play another, I have to type: <br><br>/mcicontrol close cdaudio <br><br>And then open it again with a new CD in the drive. <br><br>This may be of some use to people, <br><br>Absydion Darkflame<br>48 Wizard [Silent Ascension]<br>Tarew Marr ]</i></font><br><br>The more tips the merrier, I always say. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: If you play an MP3/CDA (CD Audio) track using this new-fangled mcicontrol thing, will it cancel any in-game noise? I'd hate to have to trade music for not hearing hill giant footsteps coming my way... <br><br>Asfaloth ]</i></font><br><br>Actually, I think it plays along with the game sounds. So you still might not hear that hill giant&#8230;<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000179.html"><b>PvP Patch Issues</b></a><br>Greyfin wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: As a melee I'm not thrilled with the pvp debuff rule change, but I'll not comment until I see how that effects gameplay... <br><br>However, I am concerned about "only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights. We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters." <br><br>This means that my guildmates and my party members cannot protect me by looting me... This loss of protection seems to me to be an acceptable result to protect players from "ninja-looting" players. In 90 days played on RZ I've been pk'd at least a dozen times. Only once was I "ninja looted" and that player (ie a stranger) gave me back the item for a reward, but at least 6 or 7 times my party members have been able to "protect" me from my foe by looting me first. And I know that I've "protected" plenty of friends by looting them... <br><br>I look forward to your comments. ]</i></font><br><br>My comment is that looting someone to protect them from being looted by the person that killed them sounds like a way of circumventing the intended cost of PvP combat rather than a feature. <br><br>And with this change there is no such thing as ninja looting against a PC, so there is no need for that protection. <br><br>The current solution might be imperfect, but it is certainly better than the old method. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor writes:<br>We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic ... <br><br>Ok, so would I. The question remains... why don't you? ]</i></font><br><br>Because of limitations to the game engine. I can't really explain it further than that. It's not something that we're completely ruling out, but it isn't something that is easily changed.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000152.html"><b>Quests</b></a><br>GreyRake wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I have another suggestion on how to make the participation in quests more appealing. Currently, a quest begins when you say a certain exact phrase to a NPC. I am sure that there are many interesting quests that are rarely embarked on because no one knows the exact words to trigger a response from the first NPC. <br><br>How about having some quests that find you? You have an NPC looking for a player character with appropriate characteristics that are needed for the quest. These could be based on a combination of class, level, race, faction, religion or location. For example, while running through the Karanas, an NPC farmer hails you and requests aid with a problem that has been vexing him. Another idea would be to have a representative of you deity appear and place a holy quest upon you. Etc... <br><br>By assigning quests this way, you add elements of spontaneity and unpredictability to your travels through Norath. This also makes sure that the player character has appropriate characteristics to make the quest challenging and the rewards worthwhile. <br><br>The caveat for this type of quest assignment is to keep it rare. You don't want NPC's pestering everyone who passes. This could be tied to a certain spawn. An NPC could spawn, look for an appropriate character for a while then de-spawn for another few days if no one matching is around.]</i></font> <br><br>I like this idea, but I see some problems with it. For example, what if the NPC seeks out people that don't want to do quests? What if he's pestering them when they are in the middle of a dangerous combat? <br><br>I do see some very interesting possibilities with this, though. I don't know how possible it is within the game itself, but you've certainly sparked some ideas there&#8230; :)<br><br>Thanks. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan, I'd like to add support to the cursed item suggestion. In every role plaing system I've encountered and in just about every major fantasy epic, there are items that are cursed ( or are inherently evil or ones that warp the bearer after a while). The classic one being the one ring in Lord of the rings. <br><br>I think it would be great to have the chance of picking up an item only to find that it is cursed and you can't get rid of it (except by a quest) and that it has a detrimental effect on the PC. <br><br>Some ideas - <br><br>1) the item would not be known to be cursed until picked up - until then it would look like any other variant of the item (this stops the cursed item being left lying around). <br><br>2) The cursed item cannot be dropped, traded or destroyed - it affects your mind and you don't want to part with it - or can't take it off. <br><br>3) The knowers of all things arcane (i.e. wizards) could have their identify spell improved to identify the curse on the item - and provide the answer on how to get rid of it via a quest. <br><br>4) cursed items of both good, evil and deity specific origins. <br><br>5) what is a curse for one person might just be an inconvenience for another and the bonus properties of the item might make it worth holding onto. <br><br>Side effects - <br><br>1) people will moan - change something and people will moan, change nothing and other people will moan - facts of life ! <br><br>2) But you've nerfed Item X !!! No, with maybe a 1 in 50 of Item X being cursed - you've got to be really unlucky to get one - you've stopped farming however ! <br><br>3) You provide more hooks into Noraths history <br><br>4) You give wizards another reason for people to search them out <br><br>5) you provide a huge number of potential quests <br><br>6) You give the programmers a headache to implement (but hey, if it was easy they wouldn't be in the job - I know I've been a coder myself :)) <br><br>Just some thoughts <br><br>Malathos<br>Wizard<br>Terris Thule ]</i></font><br><br>I'm certainly in favor of an idea like that. Rather than having such items be cursed versions of existing items, just have them be new items (though it might be more effective if that new item looked like an old on, and very rarely dropped in places where the old one could be found&#8230;). <br><br>Sure, it creates a ton of new quest ideas. But it's not as though there is a lack of such ideas. Though it's always nice to more ideas than you could possibly use.</UL>
