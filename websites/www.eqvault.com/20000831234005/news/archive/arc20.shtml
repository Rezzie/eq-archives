Tumblin brings us the following report:<BLOCKQUOTE>  'Twas a hot day in the Oasis of Marr when the shouting began.  I was there sunbathing, enjoying one of TumJum's finest, when my respite was interupted as insults bellowed across the beach.  It seemed a fight was going down, and when I saw the two contestants I was glad I wasn't involved.  It seemed Daldrum Oakbreak and Ahkim Sandstorm weren't to happy with eachother, and there isn't too much that would get in their way.<br> <br>  Crowds gathered and lines were drawn, supporters from each side began to buff their champion.  Following tradition, a referee was found to keep the fight fair.  Seeing a rare opprotunity I immediately called for bets to be placed.  The giants began to go at it, circling each other and throwing jabs.  The crowd roard!<br> <br>  The fight was quick, with Ahkim the victor.  As he congratulated and thanked those who stood by him we was brutally attacked and slain by Daldrum's supporters!  I took home a small moral from this...Victory though sweet, is also short.<br> <br>Tumblin<br>16th lvl Rogue<br>Lanys T'Vyl<UL><LI><a href="/display.cgi?/eqshots/dukeitout.jpg">Screenshot #1</a></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks Tumblin!

This article was written by Jubal Kinseeker, the Guildmaster of Fennin Ro's Sterling Order of Knights guild.  Here's an excerpt:<BLOCKQUOTE><i>The most important aspect of a successful guild is their recruitment policies. Guilds should make sure that the guild and the player are compatible before allowing membership. I look down on guilds which offer open recruiting via public channels. Considering that you will spend your online time consistently with these people, you want to make sure that there is some kind of filtering process. Although this is somewhat related to the above paragraph in making sure that the guild offers what you need, it puts the responsibility of that determination on the guild management, where it should be. An alternative to this would be if the guilds have an open invite policy, but remove the undesirables quickly. I have found that slow recruitment often prevents members from being removed later. </I></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks again Jubal!

GameCenter posted a <a href="http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-4278,00.html">medium-length news blurb</a> concerning the recent Sony acquisition of Verant Interactive.  This article features some of the first comments made by Brad McQuaid regarding this transition.  Here's a quote:<UL>John Smedley, Verant's current president, will assume the role of senior vice president and chief operating officer. Brad McQuaid, Verant's vice president and producer/programmer on EverQuest, told Gamecenter that "from our standpoint, very little is changing. We're becoming the new headquarters for Sony Online. <br><br>"If [the acquisition] affects anything, it'll be a positive one, because we'll have access to more talent due to Sony's resources and brand recognition. We're going to be hiring more people, absolutely." <br><br>He added, "This is the best thing to happen to Verant. Both entities share a common vision of the future of online gaming." Apparently, this includes Sony's continued interest in The Station, as McQuaid indicated that Verant has been wanting to do casual games for some time. <br><br>McQuaid said it's business as usual at Verant, including work on the upcoming online strategy epic Sovereign (due out in early 2001), and he hints, "there are rumors there may be a second official expansion pack for EverQuest that may be out before Sovereign." Though McQuaid would not confirm, Verant says its highly anticipated Star Wars online role-playing game should be out by the end of next year as well. </UL>

While browsing through the pages of the Gameplay Board, I stumbled across the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048557.html">following post</a> that Sony Online's Gordon Wrinn replied to:<UL>It is well known that there is double-exp loss associated with post-hell levels (31, 36, 41, 46). I suspect there is a bug somewhere, however; consider the following scenario:<br>-----------------------------------<br><br>A char is L44, and notices that when they die they lose about 1/2 bubble of exp. They make it to L45 (a proven 'hell' level, taking about 2x exp to get through) and when they die they see 1/4 bubble loss, which is expected since the bubbles represent double the exp of a normal level. They then level on to L46; when they die; they lose about 1 1/4 bubbles. When they make L47, exp loss is back to about 1/2 bubble per death.<br><br>Here is the rub: if a char dies just after making L46, they will lose a full 1 1/4 bubbles in level *45*. Since L45 is a double-exp level, they have lost 2 1/2 bubbles of exp (half a level) with a single death. This 'quadruple penalty' seems to be a bug, as they lose much more exp in L45 if they die at the beginning of L46 than if they die in L45 itself.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>So...bug or design? I understand that we should not be so concerned by numbers, but a half-level of exp in a single death seems *quite* severe.<br><br>I see good reason to require more exp to go through the hell levels. However, I don't see why post-hell levels should have the extreme penalties for dying that they do. The penalties do not serve to keep groups of friends leveling at the same pace, but rather frustrate a single player who dies at the wrong time.<br><br><i>Experience loss is calculated as a percentage of total experience, not the experience required for a current level. The number of bubbles that are lost really doesn't matter. This is just the way that the math works out. You don't lose a higher percentage of total experience, it just happens to be a higher percentage of experience required for the current level. <br><br>-Gordon</I></UL>

Gordon killed two birds with one stone this evening by writing a large message that tackled several different subjects in one post.  Here's the information:<UL>Hello all,<br><br>There are a few issues that are on the boards in multiple threads, so I thought I'd address them in one post:<br><br><b><i>-TZ/VZ Moves-</b></i><br><br>We'll be opening the /movelog command on TZ and VZ this Friday and leaving it open through Monday for move mid next week between those two servers. Specific's will be posted in the patch message tomorrow morning. If you can point out any issues that you think should be covered in the patch, please follow up in this thread.<br><br>In regards to possible moves or looting changes for RZ, none are planed or likely. RZ was created at a different time than the two other servers, and has maintained its ruleset since release. Though we tried out the loot idea on TZ, our desire is to keep Rallos as it is at present. <br><br><b><i>-Shrink Potion-</b></i><br><br>We'll be giving the shrink potion (created via alchemy) the ability to shrink the user anywhere in the near future. It will be announced in the patch message when it goes in. I can't say for certain whether this will be tomorrow or whether it will be held off until the next item patch at the moment.<br><br><b><i>-Spell Drop Rates-</b></i><br><br>We'll be increasing them, but do want to maintain a rate at which they are still desired drops, and not loot that you just destroy because it's taking up space in your backpack.<br><br><b><i>-Alchemy Prices-</b></i><br><br>We'll be adjusting these, making it alchemy less expensive. It won't be in tomorrows patch, but probably in the one after that.<br><br><b><i>-Poison-</b></i><br><br>Still looking good for an end-of-june implementation.<br><br><b><i>-Clipping Plane-</b></i><br><br>Several months ago some people complained that they were no longer able to adjust the clipping plane out as far as they had been. We've gone through all of the zone headers and put the "Maximum Clip" out as far as the data export would allow. This is already live and we've been unable to find any problems.<br><br>-Gordon</UL>

Catalyst sends word that <a href="http://www.everlore.com/askmilo/">Ask Milo on EverLore</a> has been updated with new Q&A from Milo D. Cooper.  The big issue talked about today was the female player models.  Here's a short clip from that segment:<UL>I have noticed that ALL the player characters have the physiques of Greek gods. All the women are busty, leggy and thin, all the men are broad-shouldered, lean and ready to walk the runway in front of Versace (granted Trolls, Ogres, Halflings, etc. are an exception, but you get the idea). Why did Verant make this decision? I would think that it would make the world more colorful and diverse to actually have characters who were fat, skinny, or just plain ugly. I understand and accept that EQ is a fantasy world, but I think that the best fantasy is extrapolated from reality, and is thus believable and transporting. I was curious if the decision to make EQ a world of only beautiful people was rooted in technical constraints? Love of beauty? What?<br><br><B>It's been reported so many times that it should be common knowledge in the EQ community, by now: more than anyone else, it was Rosie (a woman) who pushed for player characters with tight, hard bodies and healthy endowments. She says that she did that because, in a fantasy world, most people are going to want to be Venuses and Adonises. That sounds reasonable to me.</b></UL>

Published recently on the St. Paul Pioneer Press is a new article entitled <a href="http://www.pioneerplanet.com/tech/docs/tech1.htm">Caught on the Net</a>.  This studies EverQuest and games like it online and some of the social effects it has on certain people.  Here's a clip:<UL>Lori Gilbert began playing EverQuest in earnest after quitting her job at a nuclear power plant, a move the couple had decided upon as part of their plans to have children, her husband said.<br><br>At first, Dan Gilbert saw nothing unusual, but after a few months he began to notice bowls and plates beside her computer when he came home, a sign that she had been playing all day. When he went to bed, she would still be playing and sometimes she'd still be at it when he awoke. Friends began to worry about her health.<br><br>``That was her life,'' Dan Gilbert said. ``I didn't say anything because, at that point, I was just so disgusted.''<br><br>All the things they had done together in the past -- working on the house, gardening, watching television and just talking -- had stopped.<br><br>Dan eventually issued his ultimatum, and Lori closed her EverQuest account.</UL>Thanks Zaerin!

After<br>consecutive days of dueling over 6 months ago, avraging a total of six<br>hours dueling, Gedden was promised by the gods a final confrontation.<br><br>On Sunday, June 4th, Gedden was able to confront Lanys for this battle.<br>Lanys T'Vyl, who is the daughter of Inny himself, was very rude and<br>abrupt. After a good twenty minutes of heated converstaion, Lanys<br>attacked Gedden. She charmed a near-by human caster who then attacked<br>Gedden.<br><br>The low armored caster did little good againt Gedden in melee combat, a<br>paladin of Marr who wields a Fiery avenger. The caster was nearly<br>totally cut down and killed in two or three rounds. The charmed and<br>probally very scared caster then got a heal from Lanys who at the same<br>time hit Gedden with what I can only describe as an Ice based attack<br>which did just under 1500 dammage. Gedden then rooted the helpless<br>charmed human caster and backed off to heal himself. The caster then<br>began to burn Gedden from afar.

There were a few players, Gedden included, who<br>actually resisted this spell. Anohter 15 min of fighting occured, Lanys<br>knew that she could not win a battle againt the rightous.

The following is the response Gordon post regarding a radical post concerning the resurrection ability of Clerics:<UL><i>Bloodlord,<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to write up your opinion. Though I understand the issues that you are bringing to light, we wouldn't be interested in removing resurrection or diluting it by adding it to a few other classes. Two classes have the ability to do high-xp componentless resurrections now, giving an advantage to those people who group with or make friends with those classes. <br><br>The game is meant to give an advantage to those who form relationships and/or fight in groups. The ability to get a resurrection when you'd like one is one of those advantages. <br><br>If there is a shortage of clerics and paladins in the early hours of the morning, it should only be a matter of time before some people move in with those classes to fill the gap. Clerics are one class that nearly everyone would agree is necessary for high-level groups, so the ability to go places that you couldn't normally go without a cleric will draw people to play them.<br><br>I do wonder why you would suggest that it be removed. There is no disadvantage to it being in game, only an advantage for when you are able to obtain a resurrection. My suggestion would be to start looking at resurrection as a benefit rather than an entitlement. Perhaps that way you could not expect resurrections, and be pleased when you are able to obtain one. There's nothing to gain by removing it.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Spotted on <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048100.html">this thread</a> on the Gameplay Board.

The idea of having players tag lore items came up on the Gameplay Board recently.  Here's what Gordon had to say about it:<UL>Would this ever be possible or plausable? I ask because it would be very nice to have the option of making an item impossible to sell to a merchant. In case my motivation is not obvious, I just sold my Gigantic Zweilhander to a merchant because I was so sleepy I thought it was a 2 handed FS sword. Needless to say, at level 25 it took me a very long time to save up the 400pp I payed for it. It's not very fun to lose something you worked for in such a frustrating manner.<br><br><b><i>Player-generated tags on items aren't compatible with our existing core technology. It's definitely an idea that we can, however, keep in mind for future products.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048107.html">answered a heated post</a> on the Gameplay Board regarding why Mages and Clerics supposedly do not et mana regen spells.  Here's the scoop:<UL>Now its official..Mages and Clerics are the only people without mana regeneration spells..<br><br><b><i>I've only one comment for this thread so I'll keep it brief.<br><br>It is not our goal to make every class the same. One class getting an ability or spell doesn't entitle everyone else to that ability as well. Even when we give that ability to a bunch of other classes and not do one or two, it does not entitle everyone else to the ability.<br><br>Wizards and enchanters remain the only casting classes unable to heal themselves. Clerics are the only pure casters that can't cast invisibility or levitation. Mages are the only pure caster who cannot natively cast any movement-speed debuffs. This does not mean that there is something wrong with those classes, just that they have to depend on others to gain that capability. <br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Head 2 Head Gaming has kicked up the net's latest <a href="http://www.head-2-head.org/kunarksingle.html">review of the Kunark expanion</a>.  The final score awarded to RoK by the reviewer is 82%.  As always, here's a clip:<UL>While there are some negatives to the expansion, the better graphics and gameplay will still entice people to purchase RoK. Within the game, you will notice subtle differences such as trees swaying and smoke effects. Before this, it would seem that the trees were made out of hard plastic, which would never move, even during thunderstorms. When you are dealing with a MMORPG, the graphics are still behind those that are found in games such as Soldier of Fortune, Quake III, and Starlancer. This is a given when dealing with an online game and because of this, ROK tries to add a new dimension to EverQuest by allowing the gamer to become more immersed in the EverQuest world. </UL>Thanks Sean!

He adjusted the pack behind <br>the saddle and, waving his page over, accepted the long pole atop which <br>blazed his emblem in white and gold.  Speaking in a booming voice, he <br>shouted, "Open the gates!"<br><br>As the massive wooden gates began to part, he turned to his wife and son who <br>approached from the side.<br><br>Emma Weiss, his wife of seventeen years, grabbed his hand.

Have faith in Mithaniel Marr that good shall overcome." <br>  Straightening in his saddle, he added.  "The day I fight for a cause that <br>is not just is the day I shall fall, and not before."<br><br>Without another word, he urged his mount forward into the morning sunlight <br>outside his keep.  Arrayed on the hill before his home was a legion of his <br>guard, sunlight flashing off the polished steel of helmets and swords, each <br>man's shield bearing the emblem of Saronthal in white and gold.  At the <br>sight of their duke on his steed, they raised their swords as one and <br>cheered.<br><br>His steed reared at the sudden onslaught of noise, and he patted its neck <br>gently to calm the aggressive animal.  He raised an arm and quiet fell.<br><br>His voice carried on the wind as he shouted, "Today we march for Freeport to <br>join the armies there for the battle to come.  In one week, we shall shed <br>blood over the Desert of Northern Ro, the blood of any whom would stand in <br>defiance of justice and honor!  We fight to recover a vital artifact which <br>will bring us one step closer to the Straylight Gem, once step closer to <br>harnessing that power for truth, and not evil!"<br><br>He pitched the end of his banner into the dirt so that it stood without his <br>help, the banner snapping in the breeze.

Mithaniel Marr will be there with you, at your side, the power of <br>his might on your blade and his truth in your heart!  Believe in what is <br>right and we cannot fail!  I am proud to stand beside you in battle and I <br>salute you as the best warriors in the realm!"<br><br>The cheers from his men rose as he resheathed his sword.  Grabbing the <br>banner from the dirt, his horse broke into a gallop and took him to the head <br>of the regiment.  "To Freeport we march!" he said and they began the <br>journey.<br><br>____________________________________________________________________<br><br>Back in January, a group of the best guilds on Rallos Zek threw their weight <br>behind a massive server wide conflict in the East Commonlands, which <br>resulted in the single largest PvP conflict EverQuest has even known. Well, <br>we're at it again.<br><br>Ralloszek.net is proud to announce the Locetalon war, a massive server-wide <br>conflict at 6pm Pacific Time (9pm Eastern Time) on Saturday, June 10th in <br>the desert of Northern Ro on Rallos Zek.  Once again, this war is being <br>sponsored and supported by some of the best roleplaying guilds on the <br>server, including Black Tear, Blood Coven, The Elven Guard, Feral Elegance, <br>The Hammer of Brell, The Horde, The Lordknights, The Lords of Law, Tunare's <br>Justice, and (of course) Zifeer's Wandering Field Hospital.<br><br>Sharpen your blades, pull out that disposable armor, haul out the machines <br>of war and prepare yourself for a pitched battle under the hot desert sun <br>(and a rousing good time).

Gordon Wrinn commented about the dragon Trakanon today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><i>Players have always surprised us with their ability to easily overcome situations that we first thought were undoable, so I don't think it will be too long before some, somewhere, show's Trakanon whats what.

Does your combat skills increase while in a duel?  Gordon answered this question on the Gameplay Board recently:<UL><i>Skills are meant to be increased by fighting creatures that actually intend to kill you, thus imparting *risk* in exchange for the *reward* of a skill increase. Allowing people to skill up while dueling would allow someone to neglect a particular weapons skill all the way up to the high levels, then build it up from nothing without risk.<br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>

Gordon discussed the process of creating a name for your character in a recent response he posted to the Gameplay Board.  Here is <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/048007.html">the thread</a>:<UL>Abashi, why did you tell us to reserve names for our lizards by creating a character and then not tell us that a new naming policy would not allow us to have it...ever again? What gives?<br>Now granted, in my case the name I wanted was a proper name (Sebilis) and I had it before some yo-yo decided to put it in the filter. I deleted the fellow to make room for my new Iksar Shaman, only to find the name would not work. ::gasp:: <br><br>Now my Necromancer that I screwed up on creation with cannot be redone because I will loose my established name. <br>HELP US! Sorry'bout the name calling, it got everyone's attention in kinder-care.<br><br><b><i>Creating a character, deleting it, and then creating another character with the same name works. Of course, the character will be submitted to the name verification process, which presents proposed names to any guides or GMs on line for approval. It's certainly possible that the name got through that process the first time, perhaps since many were not aware of the proper names assocaited with Kunark, and was quashed by a GM or Guide the second time through.<br><br>It's just as well that the name "Sebilis" was not approved when you tried to make it as someone probably would have required it to be changed in the future, as proper names from Norrath are not permitted as character names.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>
