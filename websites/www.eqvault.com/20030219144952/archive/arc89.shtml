A new event was just announced for the Morell-Thule server:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings Friends at EQVault! <br><br>One night in a dream Dolumar heard a cry and saw the terrified face of <br>young and niave Elf waylaid by a vulgar, unscrupulous Orc. <br>He bolted up out of his retreating place, and drew us together for a special <br>meeting, we his friends and guildmates of Random Acts. <br><br>"We must away to the forest, and anon," he said, speaking of <br> the deep dark forest of Faydwer, home to the elves and other <br>folke. "I fear there are many young ones afraid to walk the paths between <br>Kelethin and Felwithe. Only the boldest venture forth these days, <br>and that is for the noble task of carrying the mail. "We must <br>hurry...there is no time to lose. They will perish soon if we <br>don't!" <br><br>"Yes, but Dolumar,"  Hamadryad, the guildleader, said. "We <br>must take time to plan a journey such as this...how will they <br>know we are coming? What of our reinforcements?" <br><br>"When the young and innocent are dropping all around you, <br>it is not time to plan. It is time to act! Are we not of Random Acts, <br>the Champions of Kind Deeds toward all in need! I have seen <br>it in my dream...they call us!" <br><br>Hamadryad sought the inner guide for the energies behind her <br>dear friend's words. She closed her eyes and saw Dolumar <br>standing on the central lift to Kelethin, raising his staff to <br>protect a young one from a pack of venomous Orcs, while the <br>guards stood idly by. Dolumar is bathed in light! she saw in <br>her vision. <br><br>"You speak the Truth," Hamadryad said to Dolumar, and grasped <br>his shoulder. "Let us leave now with no more planning. We will <br>send out messengers for reinforcements, and by Tunare's Will <br>they will arrive before we are spent. But if we must go down," <br>she said, looking around the room at the few valient and brave <br>fellows who were marching into danger for people they didn't <br>even know, "if we must go down fighting, then I am honored to be in <br>your company." <br><br>"Away to Faydwer! Let us start in Greater Faydark. Away!" <br><br>World: Morell-Thule <br>What: Greater Faydark First Aid Camp <br>Where: Greater Faydark newbie areas <br>When: Saturday, Aug. 26, 8:00AM Pacific <br>Why: Because people are dropping like <br>flies out there and it's our job to <br>help them. <br>Who: You! and bring a friend! <br><br><a href="http://www.stas.net/randomacts/">http://www.stas.net/randomacts/</a> </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Ariel announced that Trakanon has met his match again:<BLOCKQUOTE>The undead dragon Trakanon has been the Nemesis of the Legacy of Steel for<br>several weeks now. On our first sojourn into his lair we merely sparred with<br>the mighty dragon in order to better guage his weaknesses. Another hazardous<br>adventure led to the zone crash of Old Sebilis. Undaunted, we traveled once<br>again down to his subterranean cavern. Fungal Reavers, Reet Knights and The<br>Sebilite Protector were all unable to deter us from our goal. With a sense<br>of dread and antipation, the forces of Legacy of Steel approached the bridge<br>to Trakanon's Lair and awaited the call to charge. From the ledge above a<br>raging tide of Sebilite Juggernauts rushed at us, attempting to knock us<br>from our precarious perch. After a quick and furious battle, the Juggernauts<br>were defeated and our companions prepared themselves mentally and<br>spiritually for what would be our greatest hour. <br><br>At the eleventh hour, I gave the order to 'CHARGE!', all the while hoping<br>that I was not, once again, sending my friends to their certain doom. At the<br>back of his cavernous lair, Trakanon caught sight of us and reared up to<br>envelop our fellowship with his deadly, venemous breath. Not one of us<br>faltered; but instead our entire company re-doubled its<br>efforts - Warriors, Monks and Paladins rushed the beast head-on even as our<br>green robed Wizards and Mages rained fireballs upon his gargantuan body. The<br>battle was short but furious. Yet, at the end, the raging beast that had<br>haunted us for weeks... had fallen. Some of our company felt elation, others<br>excitement for the treasures that were gained from the Dragon's horde. As<br>for me, I merely felt relief that the beast was beaten at last...<br><br>Ariel<br>GM Legacy of Steel<br><br>and some pic links:<br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Trakdead.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Trakdead.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/trakdead1.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/trakdead1.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/mudcrush.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/mudcrush.jpg</a><br><a href="http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Tolon.jpg">http://www.legacyofsteel.com/images/screenshots/Tolon.jpg</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

From Pickle:<BLOCKQUOTE>Hi Guys,<br><br>Act 1 has finally been completed, but is now called the Prologue! You can access it by clicking on the "Completed Acts" link above. <br><br>After much discussion on what we should do re: dialogue and narration, we decided that it be best to keep it to a minimum. Thus, a small blurb is included in the beginning of the act, and the rest of the movie should tell itself. Furthermore, we've included a synopsis of what *exactly* is going on throughout the movie in the download page, and after reading this, the story should be clear.<br><br>Also added onto this act is the movie's opening title and credit sequence. I wanted to make some a bit bad-ass and energetic, to contrast from the 8 minute battle sequence, and hope this is a good compliment.<br><br>Also, if anyone can mirror the zip file, please let me know at pickle@eqmovie.com so I can add the link.<br><br>I hope you enjoy!<br>-Pickle<br><a href="http://www.eqmovie.com/">http://www.eqmovie.com/</a></BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Gordon has been making his normal rounds on the Gameplay Board this afternoon.  Here's a rundown of all of today's posts:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008205.html"><b>More Deletions on Offical Boards</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I, for the life of me, can't see how "board" posts, have ANY THING to do with "game conduct" though]</i></font> <br><br>The ability to post on these boards is one of the privileges that go with having an EverQuest account. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: If you conduct yourself poorly here, why allow you into the game where you will conduct yourself poorly infront of even more? Flaming and name callers here arent welcome here nor ingame. Seems fine to me.]</i></font> <br><br>That's basically where we are coming from. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008235.html"><b>How is Damage calculated?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. We know each weapon has has a damage and a dely<br>2. But we also know there is a level bonus that affects each hit.<br>3. We also know that str makes max damage go higher and possibly make you hit for max damage more often.<br>What we dont know is exactly how these fit together.]</i></font> <br><br>That is as intended. As I've said before, we're not going to publish the formulae used to determine what happens in combat. If you need to know more, you'll have to extrapolate from the data that you do have. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I think casters would be shocked if their 1600 hp nuke actually only landed for 800 and cost twice as much mana]</i></font> <br><br>Casters can see how much DD spells hit for per hit, in the same fashion that melee players can see how much their sword hits for on each hit. Information is given equally in that respect. If the casters however wanted to see the formulae that determines things such as fizzle and resist rates, we'd have to decline to give that info out as well. <br><br>DOTs are even more mysterious than weapons or DDs. In fact, the only reason people have a good idea of the way that most of these work is due to the parsing of the spell data file. This is obviously something that we didn't intend. Since that information is gathered via unauthorized means, we're not going to extend that out to a purposeful action such as handing out formulae. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Weve come a long way from damage/delay, but some exact formulas for calculating damage would be appreciated.]</i></font> <br><br>I'm wondering if this is leading to something else, as I know you've been here on the boards long enough to know what I'd say to this request :)<br><br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008197.html"><b>Retroactive Nerfs</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Are Retroactive nerfs EVER justified? <br>I used to agree with the idea of using nerfs to maintain balance in the game....but lately they seem to do more harm than good, (i.e. moss-covered twig / manastone / rubicite issues / Jboots) ]</i></font><br><br>Rubicite and Jboots were not changed retroactively. The manastone only had a small part of it changed retroactively (see below). <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Heh heh....Verant seems to like retroactive nerfs....]</i></font> <br><br>Actually we really dislike doing them, however sometimes an item is so unbalancing that it's necessary. Here's some examples of where we haven't done a retroactive change: <br><br>Manastone (One component was retroactive with this, it being disallowed in the Planes)<br>Box of Abu'kar (This one started as a retroactive change that was then changed back to the way it was)<br>Guise of the Deceiver<br>Lusterous Russet Armor (We announced an intended retroactive change, then changed our minds)<br>Rubicite <br><br>Likewise, there are cases where a retroactive change was necessary. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I'm starting to think that VI should just leave whatever mistakes they made in the game and end the drops if necessary. It just seems like something is innately wrong with retroactive changes, and they usually come much to the chagrin of the players.<br><br>What do you guys think? For better or worse, I'm of the belief that the policy should be no more retroactive nerfs]</i></font> <br><br>I think that you'll find people on both sides of the issue. Many felt that the Manastone and Guise should have been retroactively removed. Many feel that the twig and other low-delay weapons shouldn't be retroactively changed. I guess it depends on whether or not you are going to be a recipient of a retroactive change.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008182.html"><b>An Explanation</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: So agian I was just wondering what is the different between the song and this.]</i></font> <br><br>The difference is that the NPC is moving. It is carrying out its commands and making progress towards that goal. Movement introduces a variable that injects some risk into the situation. Now where these particular people were fear-kiting, perhaps there is a pathing issue that reduces the risk, but that's something associated with a specific point in the world, not an ability that can be taken anywhere. <br><br>The "Fear" spell tells the NPC to flee. It's the same "flee" that they do when they run low on health and try to get away. They can't really *get* anywhere, so the only reason they flee is to inject additional risk. <br><br>An NPC that is fleeing, and is then rooted, will turn around and fight. An NPC that is fleeing, and then snared, will not turn around and fight, even if their movement rate is reduced to zero (an effective root). "Effective Roots" don't have the drawbacks of a root (e.g. fighting NPC, unpredictable breaking of the spell). <br><br>Our choices in this case were: Make it so all NPCs will fight back if their movement speed is reduced to a certain point, or, limit the ability of snare spells to reduce their movement rate to zero. We did the latter.

Not to mention, it doesn't make sense that change can be made out in the wilderness. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3) remove "feature" (what they should do).]</i></font> <br><br>Why remove a feature that people can just choose not to use? Personally, I've never had a problem with autosplit, as it works out in the long run. <br><br>Things you can do: <br>-Master loot. Have one guy loot everything with autosplit off. Split after you all are done adventuring. <br>-Alpha loot. Take turns looting with autosplit on. Everything will even out in the long run.<br>-Alpha loot with split off. <br><br>-or.. Just don't worry about it. A coin here or there isnt' really that big of a deal, and if it is for you, you can still choose not to use autosplit.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/008144.html"><b>Anti-Roleplaying Server Request</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My server is tyring to change to all RPing.

Thanks.]</i></font><br> <br>Though it's probably not the most desirable situation, it's not a bug. <br><br>Experience loss from PvP combat (including duels) on non-PvP servers has the potential to cause experience loss if you die in certain ways. For instance, if you are killed by a DOT, are rooted in water or lava, killed by a pet, or bleed to death, you will lose experience. <br><br>These issues do not happen on PvP servers because we've turned off all environmental deaths on those servers due to the fact that PvP occurs there more regularly.

Gordon made a big announcement on the Gameplay Board this evening regarding the implementation of voice recongnition technology in EQ.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007958.html">the thread</a>:<UL><I>Hello all,<br><br>I see that word is filtering in that we've "Voice-enabled" EverQuest. I thought I'd open this thread to answer questions regarding the new feature.<br><br>To head off a few:<br><br>You must have a SAPI-enabled voice recognition engine installed on your system. We've tested with Dragon, and it works well, but if you use a different package, your mileage may vary.<br><br>The big question I can see is "why?". Plainly, we've implemented the technology to reduce keyboard dependance and make EQ more accessible to those with disabilities. <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Here's post #2 in this thread:<UL>When you talk about SAPI-enabled clients, would clients like "Game Commander" work?<br><br><b><i>I'm not familiar with Game Commander. You might want to look into it to see if it supports the Speech API. If it does, it should work, but I can't vouch for any limitations that it might have. If someone out there with Game Commander would like to try it out and report back here, that would be great.</b></i><br><br>Also, how would do macros and such since you can't ALT-TAB out of EverQuest to set them up? Is there a way to "hook-in" and setup macros?<br><br><b><i>There is a specific supported command-list within EQROKManualSupplement.doc in your EverQuest directory. The extent to which you can customize individual abilities remains to be seen. I imagine that it will only be a short while before people start posting their VR profiles for the public.</b></i><br><br>Do you forsee the possibilty of client to client voice communication ever being implemented in EQ or are there other software packages that can do this now? It'd be pretty cool to have the option to connect to voice-chat via a simple command.<br><br><b><i>Voice-chat capabilities will most likely not be something that would be implemented as part of EverQuest. I have heard, however, that there are programs out there which work, and function independant of EQ.</b></i><br><br>I can appreciate extending the games features to assist disabled people, but really all you are doing is bringing functionality to frustrate even more people.. Someone needs to slap the tech manager over there <br><br><b><i>I do not agree that the implementation of new features that do not necessarily have any effect on those who choose not to use them has a negative impact. <br><br>Certainly I am sure that there are things that are more important to you, however everyone has a different opinion as to what is important and what should be worked on.</b></i><br><br>Voice recognition? Please see my previous post/thread I started today "Abashi: Your input on bugs / suggestions", but to make it short, there really are bigger problems in this game (mainly Kunark!!) that haven't been addressed at all since it was released (Anyone else been chasing disappearing monsters in Field of Bone lately?). <br><br><b><I>This is a completely different issue and is off-topic for this thread.<br><br>-Gordon</b></i></UL>

Gordon was back on the boards today in force.  Today's hottest topic was if bread should be nerfed for being too powerful. ;)  *Homer Simpson Voice* Mmm, Nerfed Bread.  Here's the scoop:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007899.html"><b>The Foods We Eat: Nerf Bread!</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: OK, this has been bugging me for a long time. Abashi, please look into this. All the water flasks in Norrath contain brown liquid! C'mon, can't the gnomes build some sort of reverse osmosis system to filter the water?]</i></font> <br><br>The water is isn't brown, the flask is opaque. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why is the bread black? Must everyone burn the bread? My kingdom for summoned bread that isn't black!]</i></font>  <br><br>It's pumpernickel :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Bread is overpowered, and should be nerfed!]</i></font> <br><br>I'll check into that :)<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007909.html"><b>Why the Nerf?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I would just like to know why the nerfs on the extremely good weapons are necessary?]</i></font> <br><br>I assume you are speaking of the low-delay weapons? Items attainable in the mid 30s should not be the preferred item at 60. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: the damage ratio on the twig is not the issue.]</i></font> <br><br>Indeed, it was the damage bonus applied to the primary weapons slot. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007686.html"><b>Fatal Hits</b></a><br>We've implemented this idea to the widest extent possible (for balance reasons) with rogue assassination and one of the monk disciplines. Extending the ability to more classes (except possibly rangers with archery which I'm pushing for) really wouldn't be appropriate.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007690.html"><b>"It Must Change"</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: They keep changing it, they have to make sure you have the oportunity to read any changes they make.]</i></font> <br><br>Any changes to the agreement pop up in a separate window specifically identifying the change. That said, we do indeed want to make sure that the agreement is actively confirmed each time the game is launched.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007893.html"><b>Make Items No-DROP</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Actually NO DROP would have been a great option last year in march. It's too late now.]</i></font> <br><br>I assume that you are talking about the changes to Veeshan's Peak items. Loot from Veeshan's Peak is only on two servers to my knowledge, and they only started getting it a few weeks ago. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007673.html"><b>Customer Service Suggestions</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1) Get the GMs out of General Chat (unless they want to chat and be witty or something). Have a special Speak To The GM channel which is not only moderated, but has a VISIBLE list of the<br>order people come into the channel, and have the<br>GM give people voice in the order they're in the list. ]</i></font><br><br>Our customer service is set up primarily to deal with issues in-game. When someone (or other small number of people) can't connect, it's a technical issue which can be handled in the technical support channel when someone is there and the channel is unlocked. When a bunch of people cannot get into game, it's best to be able to address them all at once, since it's usually the same problem. At other times, chat serves as way to call attention to an issue on a server, allowing the GM in chat to route a floating GM to the server, if none are online on that particular server at that time. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2) One explanation I've heard a lot is that the<br>problems with connecting to patch (1017 et al) are due to temporary server/network congestion right at the patch server. Well, how about hooking up two or three servers on DIFFERENT nets, naming them patch{1,2,3} and having the<br>game try one at random each time you try to connect? If that didn't work, try the next one the next time.]</i></font><br><br><br>We have a ton of different patch servers currently. The process of load balancing between these servers is transparent to the user, which might explain why some think we only have one. As for congestion on the patch servers, it only happens due to extraordinary circumstnaces. We provide as much overhead infrastructure as possible to deal with 99% of the things that can occur. The other 1% would take an additional infrastructure in lograrithmic fashion. That would only get 99% of that last one percent. The 1% after that would be an additional order of magnitude.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007679.html"><b>Ugly Robe from Veeshan's Peak</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: We said EschatonBlazar. I saw the robe on FoH webpage..and I have to agree it is one of the ugliest robes I have ever seen. Verant get your act together and give us items worth busting our butts for. As far as what ive seen I think I will skip VP and stay in Fear. At least CT drops a nice robe better than the Blighted I can use..]</i></font> <br><br>Some items are better than others, both in effects and in looks. Not every item can be an incredibly cool must-have item, lest the existing incredibly cool must-have items lose importance and prestige.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007671.html"><b>Spell Slots</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There are several Ideas that I have seen that EVERYONE wants, but you all refuse to do it...WHY? Such as more than 8 spell slots, everyone wants more, 10 would be good, But you all refuse to do it? WHY??]</i></font> <br><br>I can only address specific issues rather than something as broad as what "everyone wants". In regards to this, the 8 spell limit is one of balance. Spells are organized in many cases to provide an excess of spells that people would want memmed at all times. For that reason, they must decide what spells to mem given the limited pool. This provides tradeoffs and presents unique challenges in game. <br><br>On the broader issue of what "everyone wants", sometimes what people want is in conflict with other things that those same people want. People want to be entertained, and some suggestions, though being pleasing in the short term, would harm the "want" of long term entertainment. <br><br>To present a real-world analogy, I'm sure that everyone would like the government to give them a million dollars. However, were the government to do such a thing, rampant inflation would consume country leading to a lesser standard of living than what we have now. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007658.html"><b>/target (player's name) Command </b></a><br>This function will be in the next client patch. It will have a limited range so that it is not unbalancing for PvP and other purposes.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007663.html"><b>EverQuest Family</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ester: Um, the other uncle, the quiet one you haven't heard from in 15 years. We don't know much about him...]</i></font> <br><br>Well I think that Ester would much rather be thought of as an aunt :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Anyway, may seem silly, but these boards to have a personality.]</i></font><br> <br>We are indeed trying to build a friendly rapport with the people here on the boards. Sometimes it may seem that we're being a bit gruff, but we honestly do have everyone's best interest in mind. Afterall, your best interests are also ours.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007668.html"><b>Item Suggestion</b></a><br>While there are indeed items that grant ultravision in game, either on a charged or permanent basis, racial illusions have special advantages associated with them. Secondly, we don't want the existence of other illusions to become so commonplace, which is one of the reasons that the Mask of the Deceiver no longer drops. <br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007642.html"><b>90% of Players Won't Use New Features</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 90% of your player base doesn't use / commands, nor do they care to even learn them!]</i></font> <br><br>You'd be surprised how many modifications to the game are made to support about 10% of the users. The goal of course is for each modification to help a different 10%, so with a suitable amount of modifications, the game is improved for everyone. <br><br>10% is still a very significant number of players, on the order of 30,000. It's a very worthwhile task.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007627.html"><b>The Infamous Vision of EverQuest</b></a><br>The "Vision" (capital 'V') was coined by the players after hearing us talk about our vision for the game. If you are going to make something, you have a plan for how you want whatever that is to turn out. That's no different from what we did. <br><br>The game is the embodiment of that plan. This is explained in more detail in the FAQ at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html</a> .<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007649.html"><b>High-res Text Problem</b></a><br>We've heard from several having problems.

It's always been our policy to do a refund in the event of an overcharge. They sometimes take a few days to go through, which might explain why it wasn't immediatly visible. I've escalated your issue, the refund was completed, and you should see it on your next statement.<br><br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007248.html"><b>Increasing the Text Size</b></a><br>This is indeed a good idea.

Another tip for the EQClient.ini file was sent in by Ungwe:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings,<br> <br>    After several inquiries on the ability to customize our colors for actions, chat, ect... I decided to do a little experimentation with the following discovery.  If you will open your Paint program, which most everyone or their children have played with in Windows, click on the Colors button in the tool bar.  Than click on Edit Colors;  a small arrangement of colored squares appear with another tab called Define Custom Colors.  Click on that and you now have the color squares and a color pallet.  Under the color pallet is six areas with numeric values in them.  Notice the right column of numbers.  These are marked as;  Red, Green, & Blue.  If you click on the colored squares the numeric values in the red, green & blue boxes change;  ranging from 0 to 255.<br><br>    Thus the discovery of using the numbers the Paint program gives you to change the values in your eqclient.ini file to your liking.  You can of course further the customization of the color by moving the target around in the pallet or the arrow up & down on the slide bar to the right of the pallet.  <br><br>    Sure hope this helps someone.<br> <br>                    Ungwe Lonewalker - Eci'<br>                    Styyx Myythos - Rodcet Nife</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for the tip!

One contains the basic exe and readme file, the other contains all the system files.

Gordon created a few new board messages this afternoon on the Gameplay Board.  Here's a quick rundown of them:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007508.html"><b>Monk Damage Tables</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: monks (and rogues) were designed to do MORE damage (20%+) than a warrior... this was their special benefit to groups since they could not tank nearly as well as a warrior ]</i></font><br><br>Though the percentage that you quote isn't something that we've ever stated, monks and rogues should indeed do more damage than warriors under appropriate circumstances. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: but then you say 'properly equipped'... and from your own tests you have shown that the 'proper equipment' is VERY RARE and hard to get for the majority of monks]</i></font> <br><br>Most people's idea of "Proper Equipment" is rare and hard to get for everyone. If you stick a warrior in the best gear possible then you have to do the same for the monk. If you put the warrior in "average" equipment, then the monk can go bare-knuck and still measure up.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007488.html"><b>/Book</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: It seems much more intuitive that I would use the number shown in the book on the page of spells I want to bring up, and let the computer do the hard work. Isn't that why we took up magic? Otherwise, we'ed be playing EverEngineer, and build that bridge from Qeynos to Erudia.]</i></font> <br><br>Tell me about it. I suggested this when putting together the patch message last night :)  Hopefully we'll see this in the near future.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007485.html"><b>"34 changes can be made in INI file but only 32 places"</b></a><br>The missing lines should be created the first time you start EQ.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007472.html"><b>UI Overhaul Suggestion</b></a><br><a href="http://jjonesx.tripod.com/UI.jpg">http://jjonesx.tripod.com/UI.jpg</a><br>Wow, that's pretty nifty. I'll have to send that one around the office.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007425.html"><b>Extrapolating Data From Messages</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: He has also stated in the past, however that other issues (i.e. Class issues *cough*Ranger defense*cough*) can not be validated because only a minority of the people post here. Those issues can not be assumed to have validity because we are a vocal minority and don't represent the populace.]</i></font> <br><br>There's nothing contradictory here. The twig issue has nothing to do with representation of popular opinion in regards to a class-complaint. Representation of popular opinion is a percentage-based argument, whereas represntation of a number is a numeric argument. <br><br>I consider the *number* of people protesting the low-delay weapons change to be indicative of there being a *number* of them in game. <br><br>I consider the *number* of people protesting the current status of any class to be indicative of the *number* of people in game that have issues. <br><br>I do not consider the *percentage* of people protesting the current status of any class to be indicative of the *percentage* of people in game that have issues. In other words, if 90% of [insert class] are complaining here on the boards, I do not believe that means that 90% of [that class] are unhappy.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007394.html"><b>Bard Chains</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Prior to your patch of the level 54 AE Snare song, the lower level Chains song (level 23), for high level Bards, was able to stop a SINGLE damaged MOB dead in its tracks at 50% health. In order to do this, considering the high resist rate and the early break problem, Bards had to devote ALL of their casting to doing this one thing and this one thing alone.<br><br>We know that green MOBs that run run at 50% health, and that blue MOBs that run run at 25%. After the change, the song does not stop MOBs dead in their tracks until 20%. This means that, prior to the level 54 patch, Bards could stop ALL runners. Post the level 54 patch, Bards can stop NO runners. We CAN'T STOP TRAINS now. ]</i></font><br><br>The change that was implemented about two months ago placed a cap on the maximum amount that a creature can be slowed prior to the addition of damage. At the time, the people making that change didn't think that it would affect any other spells or songs than the 54th level song. After it did, and due to the complaints here, we tested the song in depth, and determined that the way it was working before was far too powerful. The current functionality that you are describing is the correct functionality for the spell.</UL>

Today's big Patch Message is now available to read.  Here's an exact copy straight off the Patch Server:<UL>August 23rd, 7:00am<br>------------------------<br><br>*Level 1 Character Purge*<br><br>We've decided to postpone the previously announced purging of level 1 characters that had not been played in the past 30 days.  Should we reschedule this process in the future, we will again give fair warning prior to implementing the purge.<br><br>*Today's Changes*<br><br>Today's patch consists mostly of content changes within EverQuest, such as new quests, corrections to existing NPC texts, and adjustments to spawn times associated with quest NPCs and other NPCs in general.  <br><br>- /help will now display emotes, guild commands, and normal commands separately.<br>- /sit will cause your character to sit.  "/sit off" will cause your character to stand.<br>- "/cast #" (where # is 1 to 8) will cast the spell memorized in the corresponding slot.<br>- "/book #" (where # is the even displayed page number divided by 2) will take you to the corresponding page of your spell book. For instance, to flip to page 27/28, type "/book 14".<br>- "/doability #" (where # is 1 to 10) will fire the specified ability.  Abilities 1-6 are those that are set on the "Abilities" page; Numbers 7-10 represent those that are set on the "Combat Skills" page.<br>- /whotarget can be typed to do a /who on the targeted PC.<br>- "/language #" (where # is a number corresponding to the desired language) selects the chat language to use in general communication.<br>- "/language help" displays a list of available languages and their corresponding number.  "/language" alone displays the current language.<br>- /meditate causes you to sit down, open your spellbook, and begin meditation.<br>- In "HUD" mode, the Chat Box will now take advantage of higher resolutions to display more text before wrapping down to the next line.<br>- Fixed a bug that allowed users to /quit out of the game immediately without penalty.  Normal operation is supposed to cause /quit to leave the character in-game and linkdead for a period of time to discourage this action.<br>- Again changed the functionality of the "U" ("use") key.  It will no longer inspect players or loot corpses.  All other changes implemented in the last patch stand.<br>- Added new customizable color options to the EQCLIENT.INI.  The working documentation for this is below.<br>- Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges to "disappear" when the last charge was used.  The item never really disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging.  It no longer appears to disappear.<br><br><br>*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*<br><br>If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with default values.<br><br>The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. "Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode. <br><br>Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file:<br><br> 1 - Say<br> 2 - Tell<br> 3 - Group<br> 4 - Guild<br> 5 - OOC<br> 6 - Auction<br> 7 - Shout<br> 8 - Emote<br> 9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>10 - You hit other<br>11 - Other hits you<br>12 - You miss other<br>13 - Other misses you<br>14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>17 - Unused at this time<br>18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>19 - Unused at this time<br>20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>22 - Your death message<br>23 - Others death message<br>24 - Other damage other<br>25 - Other miss other<br>26 - /who command<br>27 - yell for help<br>28 - Hit for non-melee<br>29 - Spell worn off<br>30 - Money splits<br>31 - Loot message<br>32 - Dice Roll (/random)<br>33 - Others spells<br>34 - Spell Failures (resists, fizzles, missing component, bad target, etc.)<br><br>The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a list of valid settings:<br><br>RunMode    - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.<br>ScreenMode - NORMAL for the dafault window view, FULL for the full view with overlays<br>Log        - TRUE for logging on, FALSE for logging off<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</UL>

Further addressing the topic of "Too many patches," Gordon posted the following in another thread:<UL><i>Would you prefer that the game never be changed? No more quests, no more items, no new areas, no more fixes, etc? <br><br>-Gordon</i></UL>Now if only for the shake living up people's mornings, I've started a <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6565107&start=6565107#6565107">special Player View Discussion Thread</a> on our <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5001">General Board</a>.  The purpose of this thread is to share thoughts and ideas on how to make downtime more painless.<br><br>People have a right to be somewhat upset with all the recent downtime.  By my rough estimate the servers have been down for over 26 hours alone this month.  (and that's using the estimated downtime, not always the actual downtime experienced)  At the same time Gordon has a very valid point, EverQuest would be ruined if it was not properly maintained.  <br><br>Some initial thoughts and suggestions come to mind:<br><UL><LI>Give people more than 24 hours of advanced warning - It stinks to suddenly have to deal with downtime.  Announced it a week a head and post a few friendly reminders.<br><LI>Compress the downtime - Aside from non-emergency, game threatening issues have a regular "Patch Day" on a specific day of the week/month.  That way people will learn to better work around it. </UL>Feel free to jump on the <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=6565107&start=6565107#6565107">thread and post your thoughts as well</a>.

Gordon "Abashi" Wrinn talked about the flaming/bashing going on the Boards by people who believe Verant favors certain classes.  Here's <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007016-2.html">the post he made</a>:<UL><i>Can we stop this "Abashi favor's necros" bs? It's childish to assume that because I play one that I would drive the enhancement of the class. You guys want people here who play the game, but when we do, you assume that there's some class favoritism going on.<br><br>Shortly after I got here everyone was screaming about how "Brad plays a Ranger" and how they were the "favored" class. <br><br>I'm lucky if I can play my necro 4 hours in a week these days. I've made 4 levels in the past 9 months. I'll never see 60th level as I'm not in it to level these days. I have only one necro-specific item and it isn't even on that list (Harvester). I've refused to consult on most issues related to the necromancer in house (except for nerfs, which I've usually been the driving force behind). I don't really plan to go after any of these items on the list, and I told the game designer who's working on some really high end quests for all of the classes that I wasn't interested in helping with the necromancer one.<br><br>What could have been a good discussion fades into yet another thread about how we must have some deviant plan to hurt your class or favor ours. We don't play the game on "god mode", create items out of thin air for our characters, or run around trying to slip through enhancements for our classes. <br><br>Please stop posting this garbage.<br><br>-Gordon<br><br>P.S. My apologies to anyone in the thread who didn't jump on that bandwagon.</i></UL>

I noticed on <a href="http://www.eqanswers.com">EQAnswers</a> that <a href="http://www.lumthemad.net/news/966993848,87801,.shtml">Smedley wrote some of his thoughts on expanding the MMORPG market</a> at Lum's.  It's a good read, particularly for those who of you who are interested in the business side of MMORPGs.  Here's a blurb:<UL>3) During our peak hours, we're seeing around 62,000 people playing at the same time. Even more interestingly we're seeing our MINIMUM number of people rising to around 16,000 people. That's EXTREMELY important for the financial success of these games. Bandwidth is priced by the Peak Usage, so we're paying for peak usage even in off-peak times. That's why International growth is so important due to the different playing times (i.e. the UK's peak time is different then the USA's).</UL>

Gordon has posted more to the Gameplay Board this evening.  Lets get caught up:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006993.html"><b>Thousands of Twigs/Whips?</b></a><br>I would think that the sheer number of people here on the boards complaining about it illustrates that there are far more in game than some here think. I've seen dozens of people complaining about it, and considering the percentages of people who post on the boards, the number in game can be extrapolated. <br><br>Let me ask a question: Can anyone here say that those weapons are appropriate equipment for the mid-30s?<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007146.html"><b>Unique Quests</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Ive read a lot of the recent discussion about camping and item drops and I wanted to propose an idea I have had for awhile now. The proposition is to have in game quests which follow that same layout as current quests do but instead of being constant, they can only be completed one time only ]</i></font><br><br>I assume you mean once per server rather than once per player. That's probably not something that we would do. We'd rather that one-time quests be handled on a dynamic basis, with actors playing the NPCs present in most of the quest. They involve many people overall, trying to get the biggest "bang for the buck". <br><br>It wouldn't be a very good use of time to have several game designers spending a week or more of their time to input a quest that operates in the standard way, only to have it enjoyed by 3 dozen people.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007149.html"><b>Verant wants us to die more?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Every patch seems to either make dying easier or gaining exp harder with a net result that it takes a very long time to gain 1 bubble of exp never mind 1 whole level!]</i></font> <br><br>I'd say that very few patches do either, really. Perhaps if someone is dead set on camping one fast-spawning NPC, and we change the spawn time on that NPC, that might be construed as the former, but we're just trying to inject challenge into the game. <br><br>Every day people post here on the board that the game is "nothing but camping" or "nothing but hack and slash", yet that is all they choose to do while in game, when there is so much more there. These same people spend 12 hours per day in game doing what they come here and complain is boring. We're just trying to remove what is being cited as boring. Now obviously we can't please everyone in this process, for instance, those who wouldn't be happy unless there was absolutely no downtime of any kind, yet we have to try to address the issues that we can. <br><br>Just to answer your question: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why do you want us to all die Abashi (Verant)?]</i></font> <br><br>The game should be fun. One of the ways that the game provides fun is to provide challenges for you to overcome. Challenges require risk to be meaningful. The risk in this case is the chance of failure. The penalty for that being death. <br><br>If there was no death then there would be no risk which means that there would be no challenge and thus no fun. The FAQ explains this in more detail.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007150.html"><b>Why Ban Players</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Why not "Exile" their accounts to a "bad boy" server. Disable their account from access to anyother server, and transfer their chars to the new server.]</i></font> <br><br>A server really has to have a minimum number of people on it before it breaks even in terms of depreciation and operations. Certainly we'd save some money from an operations standpoint by not having to provide GM support on a server of this nature, however it would have taken so long to populate the server that it would never have been profitable.<br>--<br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I don't know, Abashi. If you ban the bad boys and morons, I think a new server would fill up real quick.]</i></font> <br><br>We might be able to get rid of more of your averagely anti-social people (KS, ninjalooting, etc.), however 75% of the GMs' time these days is taken up investigating scams of one kind or another. Maybe if these slow down a bit... <br><br>It might sound strange, but 90% of GM and Guide time is taken up by 10% of the playerbase. It's the same 10% daily. The real problem here is that when someone in the other 90% needs help, they are often in line behind several people of the 10%. <br><br>That's why we've posted from time to time that certain issues shouldn't be petitioned while in game. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007152.html"><b>Guild Logo</b></a><br>Though this is a great idea that we'll certainly keep in mind for the future, it's not something that we would see in EQ for technical reasons. This is explained pretty well in the FAQ.</UL>

Here's more quotes and excerpts that Gordon Wrinn made today on the Gameplay Board:<UL><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006503-2.html"><b>Lesbian Wedding Event</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: I am going to have a lesbian wedding on EQ. I was wondering if anyone thinks the GM's would do the name changing and support it. Hopefully a GM will reply with a good answer.]</i></font> <br><br>In-game weddings are not among the "official" services provided within EverQuest, and as a company, we have no stance one way or another on the issue. If a GM or Guide wishes to perform a service and make the name changes requested, that is up to the individual GM or Guide.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007095.html"><b>Two Accounts Canned</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: This is an outrage and I won't stand for it! I have two accounts, I cancelled the one that<br>wasnt banned but I couldn't even access the account info on the one that was. How in the<br>hell can I cancel it? Does payment stop when I am banned? Whats going on Gordon? If you think I'm going to sit around and wait for a GM to get back to me I have some bad news for you.]</i></font> <br><br>The account in question has changed hands so many times that it's hard to be sure of who to send the email to. <br><br>You'll want to contact <a href="mailto:eqmail@verant.com">eqmail@verant.com</a> to get more info. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007052.html"><b>Tracking</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: In my experience, tracking players from short distances has never been much of a problem. However, tacking players that are half way across the zone is when the trouble begins. Here's why: I think the server only sends players information about other player's locations on some time interval that I am really not sure of.]</i></font> <br><br>That would be correct. The problem that you are mentioning has to do with the fact that NPCs are far more predictable than players, and data outside a radius around the player is based off of prediction. Data within the radius is updated more often, but that outside gets old. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Purposed solution: Send *group* member&#8217;s location information more often. Simple as that! I can&#8217;t see there being much of a performance hit from that. And it will completely fix player tracking (if my logic is right)]</i></font> <br><br>That would dramatically increase the amount of bandwidth used. It wouldn't be only for those who are tracking, but for everyone. <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007057.html"><b>New & Improved Quit Command</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: People are using the "new and improved" /quit command to avoid death, since it kicks the player out so quickly. You just hafta do it when you have enough hitpoints to live for a few moments after /quitting yourself out.]</i></font> <br><br>It's a bug. It will be fixed tomorrow.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007050.html"><b>Level 1 Character Wipe</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Is there any way so that when we log on to the server screen, we can see what servers we have characters on?]</i></font> <br><br>No, as each account logging in would have to query all of the world servers. I imagine that at some future point we might be able to put something in client-side, but it would be very low priority. I imagine that people generally don't need help remembering where their characters are. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: Do we just need to log in as our lvl 1 for a very short period of time and be able to log right back out to avoid the wipe? This guy is my mule for cryin out loud : )]</i></font> <br><br>All of the information you need is at the top of the patch message. You can open EQNEWS.TXT in your EverQuest directory as well if you wish. However, to answer your question, you just need to log in, do something that will require your character be saved (move, trade, kill something, etc), and camp normally.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006901.html"><b>More Duping</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: You say verant have fixed all known duping bugs, but its evident duping is still rampant.]</i></font> <br><br>The issue that existed was very recently fixed. It might be a little while before for the effects to be noticed. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: There have been no patches since the players on the nameless raised this issue, so I can not see how verant can possibly have fixed this.]</i></font> <br><br>It was fixed before it was brought up here on the boards, and to be honest, The Nameless did not have the worst case of it.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007015.html"><b>Torpor Spell</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: But my question is how are we supposed to use this level 60 spell?<br>Post Rez? Sure, though Donal's BP will complete heal for free much better. Still though post rez is good.<br>During combat? Not sure here, the caster won't want mana sucked out of them, the tanks won't want to be slowed, and no one likes to be rooted!]</i></font> <br><br>How about between combats? It's a fairly efficient healing spell when used this way on most targets. I can also see it being usable in combat in certain cases.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/007036.html"><b>More Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Would it be possible(however great an idea this is) that the Quiver would fit in the Ammo Slot? Just seems to make sense.]</i></font> <br><br>Yes, it would make sense, but unfortunately isn't possible due to the way inventory works. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Could this be a possible solution to your never ending Rallos Zek Coin/Item loot question(I know you dislike me for bringing this up but I think its a good idea if its feasible). Create a command similiar to the /movelog "yes/no" command only make it /coinloot "yes/no". ]</i></font><br><br>We do plan to implement some kind of server-specific polling mechanism, however it is not likley to result in a looting change for Rallos. Though coin-only people might be in the majority there, there are enough people who want item loot across the servers that their wishes should be addressed as well. Item loot makes more sense on Rallos due to the reduced level-range for the purpose of PvP. <br><br>The fact also remains that people who chose to play on Rallos did so knowning the item looting rules, and it's been basically the same since release. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. This one is more of a logic question. Why can't rogue's track? Being assassins and all, you'd think they'd be able to pick up the trail of any target they're after. Right? Just a thought! =) ]</i></font><br><br>This is covered in the FAQ under "Q: Why can&#8217;t my class [insert skill here]?" <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. This question is more of a gripe, but I still see a lot of players with this issue. The Lord Grimrot spawn. He is VERY rare. I've been camping him for 3 weeks and I've yet to see the dead version of him, and I've already killed the live version. Can you at least tell me if there is a trick I'm missing. ]</i></font><br><br>No, I wouldn't be able to tell you that. You might want to ask around. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Late night GMs. I understand you're working towards creating more night based customer service, and I'll say I've seen a few more guides on in the late night then I have in the past. What about GMs? I've run into problems that required a GMs asssistance but was unable to get it due to none being on at those hours? Are you also working on the GM scenerio for late nights? ]</i></font><br><br>They are around, and there is usually one in Chat to queue requests for specific servers. You might consider dropping by there. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7. Wedding Rings. From what I understand GMs can create No Drop Wedding Rings that have no attached stats. That is all well and good, but like myself, higher level characters have no use for a ring that sits in your fingerslot but has no extra effect. Is it possible to have player made wedding rings made into No Drop status so that we can keep our wedding rings from being looted? ]</i></font><br><br>This is one for the wishlist. There are all kinds of things that we can do with items, and a lot of suggestions have merit of one kind or another. This is probably a case where the benefit to be gained from the time to implement it is pretty small, so it would be a very low priority request. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8. Just as a side note back to the Grimrot spawn, I think that the Aegis of Life quest may be broken, at least on the Rallos Zek Server. The paladin that gives the quest won't respond to me when I speak with him, and this is happening with 3 others I know doing the quest. ]</i></font><br><br>There might be something more to it. The guys tell me that the quest is working fine. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 9. I dunno if this was brought up to you, but what is the feasiblity of putting a new druid/wizard teleport site near the Qeynos hills/everfrost area? ]</i></font><br><br>None. We feel that there are too many teleports as it is, which is why they are a bit more limited in Kunark. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 10. I'm a level 42 cleric and I got my butt damn near killed by a orc warrior cuz I couldn't out melee him. I lived w/ about 50hp and no mana..whats up with that? Those guys have been green since level 20! =) ]</i></font><br><br>I'd have to see it to believe it. What level was the orc? <br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006550.html"><b>/Q Bug</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: /q take max 5 sec now :)  just /q on every bad situation, thats work at 90% of all time.]</i></font> <br><br>That's a bug by the way. It will be fixed in tomorrow's patch.<br><br><LI><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/006818.html"><b>Q&A</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 1. Why not make all pets be named after the character? NPCs have pets named after the owner. So, if your character name was Merlin and you summoned a pet, the pet would be called Merlin's Pet. It would be MUCH easier to buff player's pets if you knew which pet in the group was theirs.]</i></font> <br><br>There's a little more flavor in this implementation, not to mention, the conversation between people to determine who's pet belongs to whom isn't necessarily a bad thing. Not to mention, it's been this way since release and has worked well. I doubt that we'll change this. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 2. Why do pets owned by PCs (not charmed but summoned) show up on tracking? There is no usefulness to this and they should be filtered out. I know they are treated as NPCs, but that still does not answer my question. Even when you filter out players with "/trackerplayers off" they still show up. I would rather track players than player's pets. PLEASE remove them from tracking and make rangers, bards and druids happy!]</i></font> <br><br>They show up because they are NPCs. Regarding your suggestion of a filter, it's possible that we may implement something like that in the future. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 3. The solution to making the tracking window more efficient is to simply add a scroll bar. A lot of people have said this for quite some time. Filters are not necessary.. just add a scroll bar that will show everything that is in the tracking range of the player.]</i></font> <br><br>We have some things in mind already for tracking, but thanks for the suggestion. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 4. When will the bard songs lullaby (AOE mes song), chains (level 23 non-exploited snare song) and pixie strike (target mes song) be fixed?]</i></font> <br><br>Ester is looking into lullaby and pixie strike, but we've had some other things pop up over the past few weeks that have taken priority. Regarding chains, it's working as it is supposed to. I understand that the claim is that it doesn't work as well as it did before NPC change that wasn't necessarily supposed to affect it, however upon looking into it we've determined that the way it works now is sufficient for the spell. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 5. Why are players allowed to remove coins from the trade window?]</i></font> <br><br>This is on the list. It amazes me the lengths that people will go through to scam each other. The sheer number of the reports of scams of this nature is astounding. GMs litterally spend 3/4ths of their day dealing with scams. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 7. The Play Nice Policies state that killing green mobs is "Not Playing Nice."]</i></font> <br><br>No they don't. Check the copy attached to the rules of conduct. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: 8. While I do not play very often on a PVP server, I have been really wanting to lately. Perhaps its the fact that the BLUE servers are so crowded and more people are being less friendly. In any case, the one thing that keeps me from playing PVP now is the same thing that always has. There is no penalty for killing another player. There is a penalty for dying though.]</i></font> <br><br>Play on Teams server (VZ or TZ). Both servers sport faction penalties for killing other players. They are pretty severe. Usually within 4 or 5 kills you'll be KOS to the hometown of the target. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote from original post: My suggestion is to allow players to turn DROPPABLE items into NO DROP items through an NPC and make them unsellable]</i></font> <br><br>The way items work in EQ would not support this. The items are not objects in and of themselves, but rather a reference (by number) to a central database. That means that we can't set attributes such as nodrop on a per-item basis.</UL>
