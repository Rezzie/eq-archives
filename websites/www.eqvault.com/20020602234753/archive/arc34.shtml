Alan fired off a post of what he calls the "first wave" of the PvP changes.  Here's all the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000150.html">post from the Developer Corner</a>:<UL>When we patch next, the following changes will be implemented on the PvP servers:<br><br>Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range.<br><br>Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena.<br><br>De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.<br><br>There may very well be other changes in the patch, so read the patch message carefully. And this is only the first of the things that we plan to change, so don't worry that this is all that we plan to do. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can.<br><br>Alan</UL>

This is the Friday edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000148.html"><b>Rare Shaman Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: There are three Shaman Spells that are VERY rare, or may not even exist. Please confirm that they too will have their drops increased. <br>Rain of Sickness - level 50 Never seen shaman with it <br><br>Tumultious Strength - Level 39 Never seen shaman with it <br><br>Growth - Not sure of level Does not exist? <br><br>Toxs ]</i></font><br><br>I often think that my comments on these sorts of things are extraneous. But I figure it's my job to type something here, so I do. :)<br><br>--------------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Rain of Sickness does not exist in our spell database. Perhaps you are referring to a different spell? <br>Tumultuous Strength is in the group of spells that have had their drop rates increased on test. This change should go live next patch. <br>Grow currently doesn't work and is not in game. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------------<br><br>There ya have it.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000140.html"><b>More Cleric Spell Discussion</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: You said you were adressing the drop rates of the 39 and 44th level spells. Does this mean you will also remove the vendor-purchasable ones from the loot table? This would actually help the frequency of the drops. For example, Circle of Wakening Lands (44 druid) is still dropping from the wurms in the Great Divide. Since I have to go to Wakening anyways in order use it, I can just *buy* it when I get there. <br><br>Please address this issue! <br><br>-Puppypaws Fleetfoot, Veeshan ]</i></font><br><br>You can only purchase that spell (and the portal spells) from Vendors in Wakening Lands and Skyshrine. This is a bit limiting to those that can't access those vendors. Those spells will probably continue to drop as they do now.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000149.html"><b>New Enchanter Spells?</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First off,<br>This is NOT a rant or anything like that. <br><br>Just a simple question. <br><br>Is there any more spells expected pre-SoL for enchanters? <br><br>Looking at the higher level spell choices our selection seems to dwindle considerably compared to other INT and WIS classes. <br><br>Wizards 59th + 60th Combined = 11 spells <br><br>Enchanters 59th + 60th Combined = 7 spells <br><br>/shrug Just hope to see alittle creativity come out of next major patch to hit test. Please consider. ]</i></font><br><br>We currently have no plans to add new Enchanter spells. But you never know what will happen. <br><br>As for the number you've quoted&#8230; well, you'll also note that Enchanters have, by far, the largest selection of spells. I have no problem with them having the smallest selection at any given level (or two). The number of spells a class has isn't necessarily an indication of the usefulness or desirability of those spells, and most certainly isn't a gauge of the value of a class (or the creativity of Verant).<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000146.html"><b>Wizard Teleport Question</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Why is it that we can't teleport to our spires in Great Divide? <br><br>+1 Why is it that our evacs arn't as reliable as that of druid evacs? Or is it just gossip that our evacs fail when they are needed and leave people behind? <br><br>P/S your new planned add-on really is a "work of art".. well done guys! ]</i></font><br><br>More information from the Oracle of Spells&#8230; <br><br>--------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Self only teleports to the Velious gate areas should go in sometime soon. <br><br>Both Druid and Wizard evacs have the same percentage chance of leaving someone behind. Though this chance is very small and it rarely happens. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>--------------------------<br>And, thanks for the compliment on the new expansion. But, well, you ain't seen it yet. :)<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000147.html"><b>Enchanter Mana Spell Series</b></a><br>Suudar wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Alan,<br><br>Since you seem to be on roll with spell questions, I would like to propose another question. What is with the Enchanter "mana" series line of spells? Thicken, Crystallize, Clarify, etc. Mana. <br><br>I know one is used in Wu's Fighting Gauntlets. But what about the rest? It seems quite intriguing to find out what you get after learning to make poison vials and get peridots. Then you get a vial of mana, that doesn't do much... Or so it seems. Can you shed a little light, not too much though as it seems to destroy the vials, on this line of spells? <br><br>Thank you! ]</i></font><br><br>I couldn't shed light if I was plugged right into a nuclear power plant. But Lawrence can&#8230; <br><br>----------------------------<br>quote: <br><br>Actually these spells are already used quite extensively in tailoring. I brought the subject up with Dan and he tells me there are some other recipes that should be going into the next patch that will also make use of these spells. <br>- Lawrence Poe <br>----------------------------<br><br>Like mana from heaven, or at least mana from small vials.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000134.html"><b>Flowing Thoughts</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First, Guys be honest, you created item with mana regen on it and therefore broke the promise the you wouldn't do this. It does not matter that it's not as good as clarity 2 (neither is clarity 1) and is dropped by one of the most powerful mobs in the game. Just admit you did it and go on. <br><br>Second, Does this cheapen the enchanter class? As I understand the item, it is basically like the haste items the melee types covet. So as long as Flowing Thought stacks with clarity (which I understand it does), it should make the enchanter even more desirable for the fastest mana regen possible. <br><br>Third, Perhaps you should stop making promises as you tend to have to break them... <br><br>Just my 2cp<br>Nalenye dell'Arte<br>Level 52 Enchanter of the Tribunal ]</i></font><br><br>I am being honest. We DID add an item that give mana regeneration. <br><br>But we did not promise never to do so. That's the part where there is some misunderstanding. <br><br>Flowing Thought IN NO WAY reduces the desire for, or the usefulness of, enchanters and their ability to cast Clarity spells. The implication that it does (even if every character on every server had an item that gave Flowing Thought) is wrong. I find it offensive that people are unwilling to actually examine the effects of this item before calling us liars and thieves and other less than polite names. <br><br>Flowing Thought stacks with all enchanter and bard mana regeneration spells and songs. It won't stack with other items that regenerate mana. <br><br>It provides far, far less mana than Clarity. <br><br>It only appears on items found in the Plane of Hate and are no drop. So you won't find anyone under 46th level with an item like this. <br><br>But, oddly, those of you that decided to be offended by this item made no effort to discover the truth of the matter first. This might be because Flowing Thought is hard to get a hold of. Being offended at the addition of an extremely rare item that, indeed, has no impact on you or your chosen class is pretty silly, now isn't it. <br><br>I'm sorry for the rant. But being painted the villain, having our product and our reputations attacked without cause, is not something that I'll accept. <br><br>happ7 wrote: <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: um i hate to tell ya but bards were the first to have the mana regen ability. honestly you should not consider clarity a chanter defining spell id say you are much more a illusion spell specialist if you are an enchanter ]</i></font><br><br>The timeline for the arrival of the abilities of a class are completely irrelevant to any determination as to whether those abilities are 'class defining' or not. The fact that bards did, indeed, get the first ability to regenerate mana for others has nothing at all to do with whether or not that ability defines the enchanter class. <br><br>It IS a defining ability of the class, as it is for bards.</UL>

Rithnok Tatsukao announces a new event for the citizens of the Test server:<BLOCKQUOTE>  The sun set slowly upon the precieved horizon of the Eastern <br>Commonlands as a single being walks slowly through the tunnels leading to <br>the realms of the Northern Ro Desert... He smiled softly to himself as he <br>basked in the dying light of the day. The comming of the night Heralded the <br>arrival of a world weary traveller. With him he brought only his skills as <br>an adventurer his back pack filled with his trinkets found on his travels. <br>Armed with his knowledge and his sword he slowly put down his leather <br>backpack upon the ground and propped himself up against one of the walls of <br>the tunnel. Slowly he rumaged through his pack as he sat upon his tail base <br>withdrawing a set of parchments covered with the strange writting of his <br>homelands. Although many would immediately assume he was a creature of the <br>darkness only because instead of flesh he sported claws, horns, teeth, and <br>scales. This was untrue, for those who knew him knew his knowledge was not <br>of this world. But of one yet to have been visited. This was a strange <br>Iksar, his mind was not set upon battle and glory. It was set upon a strange <br>quest that led him to this land he finds himself, perhaps one might ask <br>about his adventures. Perhaps he might tell of them... Who knows?<br><br>Event Name: Story Time In Norrath<br><br>Time: 8pm EST Monday May 7th<br><br>Place: Tunnel To North Ro In The Eastern Commonlands.<br><br>Synopsis: For the first time an event will be held on Test Server. There <br>will be a full open story time on the test server. The purpose of which will <br>be to tell stories of lands, creatures, and adventures, that might not be <br>Norrathian in the beginning but they all pertain to the lands and peoples of <br>the lands of Norrath. This will be the intoduction of story time in Norrath, <br>And the second installment of a continuing event on the second and Forth <br>Mondays in each month. The storyteller will be present for all to hear... <br>Perhaps you might find insight into your quests or perhaps you might find <br>inspiration to tell your own stories of adventure in the lands. So those who <br>always wanted to be bards but never got the chance? Come and listen, if you <br>have a story that is about the lands of Norrath Please feel free to come and <br>tell the storyteller perhaps he will find time to let you speak your tales <br>to those who gather. Come One! Come all! All are welcome here of all ages <br>and of all races, All are invited, From the players, to Guides, And even the <br>ever so Elusive GM's We hold no bar to anyone. As long as you wish to <br>listen... Ask questions and basically have some fun hearing what heroes and <br>villians alike do in their times. Above all else!

I guarantee you, no one that wants to play a cleric will play a paladin instead because the mana efficiency changes. Its about the spells that are available. Allowing hybrids to have the same mana pool was a great thing. You should take away the efficiency penalty as well, since the real difference is the spell lists. (I think that hybrids are over-penalized there as well, but I wanted to focus on the efficiency issue.) Just my opinion. <br><br>Larsk Thunderfoot of Prexus ]</i></font><br><br>Well, we disagree. There were three differences between hybrids and their caster parent classes; Mana pool, casting cost, and spell selection. <br><br>Recently we removed the mana pool difference and significantly reduced the casting cost difference. We also gave the hybrid the advantage of unique spells and a significantly reduced penalty for casting while fighting (weapon delays continue to count off while spells are being cast &#8211; only for hybirds). In combination, all of those changes make for a very nice balance of spell casting power and melee power for the hybrids. <br><br>Yes, we'd have to remove the spell availability restriction before there would be any chance that people would prefer the hybrid over the parent caster class. But just that restriction alone isn't quite enough to make the balance that we want. We're very happy with the current balance, and I don't see any need to change it. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor said "If hybrids could cast spells as well as their parent class, then nobody would really want to play that parent class." <br><br>You can't be serious!

Do you really think that? <br><br>Scout Swiftshot<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>There's no reason to try to make what I wrote sound like some sort of conspiracy or trickery. I wrote that if hybrids could cast as well as their parent class, then nobody would play the parent class. That's certainly true. <br><br>If your ranger had the same spell line up as a druid with no penalties (cast as well as their parent class), then there would be very few druids. <br><br>Yes, I really think that. You do to. I'm not trying to be tricky or cover up the fact that there are indeed two restrictions on hybrids for their spells (see post above). There's no need to read things into my comments.

They will probably never get foot speed enhancement spells, that sort of travel will always be the real of the Druid, Bard and Shaman. <br><br>The reasoning behind this is pretty simple, really. <br><br>Druids have few weaknesses as a class. In fact, with the recent addition to their high level healing abilities, Druids are a very well-rounded and balanced class (though this is not the result of any final balance decision about the class, and things might be changed). Their ability to transport people is pretty darn good as it is. Not only can a Druid pop you across the ocean, he can speed up your running and get you to the final destination pretty quickly. <br><br>Wizards right now have two specialties, damage and teleportation. They should be the masters of arcane magic and ripping holes in the fabric of space. Making them the masters of teleportation not only makes a lot of sense, it also adds a dimension to the class. <br><br>Yes, we are moving toward making Wizards the master of arcane transportation.

Whereas new content is new for everyone." <br><br>In one sense, you're very right. I was partying with some folks the other day who started playing about a year ago, and I mentioned something about "since Kithicor was changed". They were completely confused, especially when I told them that Kith used to be a n00bie zone. To newer players, it's almost as if Bloody Kithicor never happened. (That's a sad fact, but is beside the point of what I'm getting at here.) <br><br>In another sense, this isn't the whole truth. For example, even after two years of being involved in EverQuest, my highest-level character is at 21. I'm certainly not high enough level to experience a large portion of the game, and that includes much of the content that was released new since EQ's release in 1999: most of the Planes, Velious, and much of Kunark. <br><br>You can go on releasing new high-level content, and you can tweak and change the existing high-level content as much as you like, but it'll be new to me once I finally get there. The question is really whether new players will be more likely to stick with EQ and derive more enjoyment from their low-level play if the low-level content is updated and redesigned as well. <br><br>Another way to look at it is, if you change Qeynos Hills or Misty Thicket or Butcherblock Mountains, you're updating content accessible by nearly the entire player base, and what's more, you're updating around a pre-existing structure, taking care of most of the work of content development. When you do another add-on or change some underused zone in the depths of Velious, you're excluding a lot of casual gamers from experiencing our ever-changing Norrath. <br><br>The plague of Bertoxxulous in the Karanas is a great example of the sorts of things that should be going on all the time in EverQuest. Huge expansions of high-level content may be more exciting from a press-release standpoint, but as game designers, it's just as important that the entire game be kept exciting. To be honest, I'm quite surprised that Freeport has yet to be taken over by Dark Elves (or the same for Neriak).... :)<br><br>Well, I got long winded too (hehehe!), so I'll be done now. :)<br><br>Nizanko Seigikan<br>21st Shaman of The Tribunal<br>Norrathian's Justice, Solusek Ro ]</i></font><br><br>While Misty is certainly accessible to nearly everyone, it's not used by everyone&#8230; <br><br>The Plague is certainly the sort of thing that we'd like to do more of. <br><br>And I'd be pretty shocked if the folks in Freeport could manage the firepower to take Neriak, that place is a fortress. Freeport, on the other hand, is as defensible as Swiss cheese. <br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: First a coment. I agree the adding more content has it's vaule of expanding the world and creating new places to explore. But changing the exiting content makes it feel alive. Ever expanding content adds bredth, altering existing content adds depth. I am a huge fan of the game and salute the abitious expansions to add bredth. However, I and probably a large majority of long time players, would like to see more depth. I would even trade a new zone for a monthly change in content. It doesn't always have to be major, but something should be changing out there. More than it is now. <br><br>Second, our (as players) creating the story. I'll drink to that! I have been runinng and participating in weekly "raids" for more than a year now with a group that started at level 4 "raiding" blackburrow. We crawl dungeons, scour countrysides and generally make the most of the content that is there. We try to follow or create story lines that go with these weekly adventures and have found a wealth of places to do so. But, what we are doing is artificially inserting stories over the existing environment. What we lack are additional tools. <br><br>For instance: We recently had a story of a character dissapearing. After some research she was discovered to have been captured by the Kly and being converted in Delnir. So, we went on a rescue mission to save her. This fit nicely with the content already avaialable. But, what we wanted to do (in the story) was do a sort of "upside down" crawl. We wanted to put the hapless victem in the bottom of Delnir and have the party "ported" to her location with no knowledge of their location. (as the story unfolded the group still did not know where we were going to fight that night) In doing so they would then need to fight their way out of a dungeon with no maps, no idea where they were and a party member that was "off". (Hugging Kly believers and then attacking them) <br><br>For reasons I understand from a "big picture" point of view we couldn't get a GM to port us into the bottom of Delnir. Still, it would have REALLY helped the story line. The GM's wanted to, but it was a violation of policy. <br><br>My VERY long winded point is this. GM's need to be given a little more freedom to help players out that are working to create a story line. We all would have gladly agreed to not petition for help, corpse recovery or anything if the GM had been able to help us out. We were accepting a wild risk for some great fun. We belonged in Delnir. We were of the apropriate level and size, so we were not abusing the powers. It was clear to everyone including the GM's, but their hands were still tied. <br><br>Free the GM's! (hehehehe) <br><br>Ziff Harbinger<br>Dusk Eternal<br>Ayonae Ro ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately we just don't have one GM for every 6 players, like we usually to playing pen and paper. And we are also constrained but the fact that this game has to be played on the computer, not in our heads. <br><br>So, as players, you have to be more clever (and, sometimes, less creative) with your story lines. You have to try harder to work within the restrictions of the game. <br><br>We'd like nothing more than to have a game flexible enough that your capture scenario would have worked. That would probably be a good goal for any game like ours to try to make possible.</UL>

The more I thought on it, the less sure I felt. A friend said she thought it was pronounced with a hard "u" and "c" sounding as "s", or Luclin = "Loose*lin." This sounded better to me, but several coworkers confused the issue by agreeing with the hard "u" but reverting to "k," Luclin = "Luke*lin." As I rule out a soft *u* and *s* (Luss*lin?) combo, which of the other three is correct?<br><br>Thanks =)</b></i><br><br>This I can answer. It's pronounced LuckLynn. You were right the first time.<br><br>Alan</UL>Hey, it's a start. :)

From Merliben Halliwax:<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes. And that is all I know!" Zarn continued. "I was getting to the end when i remembered my errand." <br>"Oh, you blunderhead! You left me thinking there was much more!" Thurbiz scoffed. <br><br>"Bah! Blunderhead, indeed! I have found out some very interesting news and you call me a blunderhead?" Zarn cried. "You are always nosing about, i thought you should like to know about this kind of thing!" <br><br>"Not nosing about! Finding things out! And it is usually dark, nasty business as it has always been, not just finding half dead theives in windmills! But come..." Thurbiz continued before Ialle or Zarn could correct him with a "Scout!", "Let us put our heads together a moment. Obviously if there are Gnomes attacking Gnomes with the Help of gigantic skeletons somewhere, this is not the best situation. Necromancy is a disease, it seems, spreading across the face of Norrath. First the Gnomes in the Mines of Old, or rather, the Mines of Malfunction..." <br><br>Mumbled agreements from Ialle and Zarn followed. It was well known to the Halliwax Family that Zakis Halliwax was slain in the Mines deep in Ak'Anon by Necromancers of Bertoxxulous, but nothing could ever be proved to the King's Court. <br><br>".. and now it has turned up half a world away! I should not be worried if it were not gnomes... we have sharp minds and they could do much damage to the good worshippers of Brell..." Thurbiz continued. <br><br>More muttered agreements. <br><br>"So... in light of the fact that we have become lazy, fat Gnomes.. AND that this is a great threat to Norrath in general, and the Gnomish Good name in particular, I say we find out what we can from this .... Scout. And then we do something about it." Thurbiz insisted. <br><br>"Hear Hear! " Zarn agreed. "I don't know all about the gnomish good name, but I do know that you have become quite fat and lazy indeed and DO need a good adventure!" he chuckled. <br><br>- from the Fourth Book of the Halliwax history dealing with the war against the Children of Isharuuk<br><br>To read all the books of Halliwax history, visit the Thurfiz' Kin library at <a href="http://thurfiz-kin.8m.com">http://thurfiz-kin.8m.com</a><br><br>Also, the Enemy's library at <a href="http://isharuuks-children.4t.com">http://isharuuks-children.4t.com</a> is interesting and they are in need of new members.<br><br>Merliben Halliwax<br>Wizard of Solusek Ro<br>Leader of Thurfiz' Kin - Tallon Zek</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Banegrivm brings us the following word:<BLOCKQUOTE>It had been thought what would be the coming of the Plaguebringer was just <br>that. As events unfolded about us in Norrath things were discovered. The veil <br>that seals Veeshan off from Norrath finally begind to break way and Now the <br>Bloodsabres and their unholy allies seek to summon the Lord of Decay into <br>Norrath. In Firiona Vie's return to Felwithe it was discovered that Tunare <br>herself now seeks entry into Norrath. This is only the beginning. <br><br>Long ago the ancient wurm Trakanon revealed his prophecy of the end times to <br>Edril the Lancer; the last of his chosen heroes of the days that prepare to <br>unfold before us now. The strange circles that have been sighted throughout <br>the lands also seem to herald this coming war as indicated by what seems to <br>be their marks or holy symbols upon it. As evidence by these circles within <br>the Rathe Mountains and Lake, Oasis of Marr, Castle Mistmoore, and Neriak <br>just to name a few of the locations. <br><br>Further information on the war can be found by way of www.1fol.cjb.net under <br>the war thread. As to where it concerns to the realm of Druzzil Ro I am <br>concerned for I would hate to think of what might happen if we were all <br>caught off guard when the gods may come, and their minions might come as <br>well. Whose to say a god would not show without henchment and or followers. <br>Think the Bloodsabres would stand idly by while Bertoxxulous walked the lands <br>assaulted by adventurers or another god? <br><br>As such I am asking everyone that sees this missive hailing from the lands of <br>Druzzil Ro to bind together. I saw what happened at Bloody Kithicor and we <br>were fortunate to have pulled together that day across the field of battle. I <br>would have hate to imagine the carnage that would have been had we all not <br>chosen to share the field that day. Thus being the case I am asking all <br>guilds to please join us at the Inner Council. <br><br>I realize everyone may not see eye to eye, however I would like to think that <br>we are also adults and could put aside our differences for a time to see this <br>thing through. No faction or group will stand alone, we MUST stand together <br>or all WILL be lost. We are to a time when we have no choice. Again, I am <br>asking that we could all come together. If we can stand together, all of <br>us...we stand a chance, if we become proud then we will fall and the streets <br>shall be paved in our blood. <br><br>I would ask all those that would come to throw their hand to the war front in <br>our realm to please post to the war thread for those guilds that wil join us, <br>and a war council will be conveiened the following week for all of us to <br>gather about and further discuss things. Again, ALL GUILDS are welcome and <br>INVITED to enter into the round table of the Inner Council. <br><br>May the light shine trut, <br><br>Banegrivm Shadowblight <br>Sovereign Lord of the 1st Fist of Light <br>Inner Council Member </BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks!

Tzuten Tsunami informed of of a recent event that involves Firiona Vie:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings fellow adventurers,<br><br>	Last evening I recieved a message from my dear friend Timbre that<br>the Firiona Vie has returned to Greater Faydark. Seeing that I am a curious<br>sort, and my current adventure within Kedge Keep was successful,  I decided<br>to see this for myself. I followed the mass of players as Firiona led them<br>from the gates of the High Elven City to Lesser Faydark. Many feel into<br>blackness (/ooc went LinkDead) when we entered Lesser Faydark. Seeing this<br>has my oppurtunity to speak with the Princess, I offered my humble services<br>as a monk. She smiled and thanked me.<br><br>	It seems that she was searching for an old friend of hers. The<br>Unicorn that wanders about in that forest. In short time the unicorn made an<br>appearance and spoke to the assembled crowd. Some of the followers of Cazic<br>Thule and the darker gods were on hand to "heckle" the Princess and the<br>unicorn (/ooc roleplaying Player Characters). Those were met with stern<br>words from myself and the others who guarded Firiona. At times I found<br>myself quiet vocal in the defense of this Elven Princess.<br><br>	It seems to be that they are trying to summon the "Avatar of Tunare"<br>and they need four magical stones to do it. With the knowledge of the stones<br>existance (but alas, not their location) we headed back to the King. While<br>Firiona told the King what was needed to bring forth the "Avatar of Tunare"<br>more hecklers interrupted the King (/ooc more RolePlaying Player<br>Characters), and more people defended the king (myself included). The King<br>then began to call forth those people that traveled with Firiona to thank<br>them. I was quiet shock when I was summoed before the King and given a token<br>of his thanks. I and the others who recieved a token was told to seek out<br>one called Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato and show him the token we recieved. We<br>thanked the King and Princess and left the hall.<br><br>	We found Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato in a nearby inn and each of us<br>was giving an item suitable to our class for aidding Firiona. I recieved an<br>Earring of AC 5 effect: Haste.<br><br>Here are some Screenshots of the Event:<br><br>Tzuten meeting Firiona Vie and stumbling on his words:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_and_friona_meet.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_and_friona_meet.jpg</a><br>Tzuten is summoned by the King Thex:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/summoned_king.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/summoned_king.jpg</a><br>Tzuten is praised by the King:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_is_praised.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_is_praised.jpg</a><br>The Coin...<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/the_coin.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/the_coin.jpg</a><br>Announcement from Lord Nethryn the Arbitrato:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_name_in_lights.jpg">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/tz_name_in_lights.jpg</a><br>The Earring I recieved:<br><a href="http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/earring.gif">http://www.technozen.com/tzuten/images/earring.gif</a> <br><br>(/ooc I would like to that those evil roleplayers, for making the event that<br>much more special, that Iksar Monk*forgot your name* and the High Elf in the<br>King's Court.

From PlanetEverQUest:<BLOCKQUOTE>This week's <a href="http://www.planeteverquest.com/features/quiz/index.shtml">EQ Quiz is about Shadow Knights</a>.  Shadow Knights are the evil counterparts to Paladins. Part warrior and part necromancer, these evil knights use the powers of the undead to aid them in their battle against the forces of good. Shadow Knights work best in group combat but through the use of a pet and their dark magic can solo very effectively. But there's so much more to these dark knights .. how much do you know about them? <br><br>This "just for fun" quiz will challenge all that you know, or might not know, about the dark warriors of the realms.  Harm touch isn't the only thing that shadow knights can do.  Take the test and see how much you know .. or don't know about the Shadow Knights of EverQuest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Here is today's edition of the Absor Infobits:<UL><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000132.html"><b>Annul Magic Update</b></a><br>Just a small update. I have been informed that this scroll has been updated and Enchanters will no longer be listed as able to use the spell after the next patch.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000139.html"><b>Guardian Robe</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Hi, <br><br>I obtained a Guardian Robe from Skyshrine a while back and I play a Wood Elf Druid. This robe has nice stats and is a fairly rare item for a Wood Elf to have. The problem that I have with it is it displays as a PINK TUNIC!! I am a male Wood Elf and get ridiculed alot by fellow players for wearing pink. Is there any way that this item could have a Robe texture added instead of just being a pink shirt with some trees on it? I would really appreciate this because i really like the magic resistances and mana that this item gives and have no plans of changing it anytime soon. <br><br>Thanks<br>Tomwin - Cazic-Thule ]</i></font><br><br>Unfortunately, some races just don't have robe textures. <br><br>Wood Elves are one of them. The rest are, I think, Dwarves, Half Elves, Halflings, Ogres and Trolls. Any race that doesn't have a native Intelligence caster doesn't have a robe texture. It's one of those things that had to be left out for efficiency when the game was built. <br><br>So if your character is wearing a robe and you don't see a robe, that's why. Or if you see some robes that fit several races and classes and wonder why your race can't wear it, that's probably also why. It's not usually a bug. We just didn't make too many robes that would fit people that have no robe texture in the game to display. <br><br>What you are seeing is a tint to one of the other textures available to your race. Why it's pink&#8230; that may remain a mystery. I'll prod a few people and see what I can find out. I would think that a truly tough guy could get along just fine in pink.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000140.html"><b>Cleric Spells</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: A long while ago, when Kunark was released you guys said something to the fact of 'Spells will now be dropping, but the spells that are the 'core' of your character will still be purchaseable at NPC vendors. (That isnt verbose, since it was almost a year ago, but that was the gist of it) When Velious came out, a new healing spell was added to the game for clerics called Celestial Healing, now I dont know about you, but for a level 44 spell this one sure does seem hard to get, I'm level 57 and i've been trying to get it because i'm trying to get ALL of my spells, ya know? =) I'm just wondering if placing this spell on really hard monsters was intentional? <br><br>Also there is sort of a rumor spell floating around called Turning of the unnatural, I'm wondering if this spell exists, that is all. I've never ever seen a single cleric that has it, and i've never seen it drop. <br><br>Oh, and please look at the RageFire spawn! =p hahah =) ( I had to throw that in there ) <br><br>Mishy ]</i></font><br><br>For more on that: <br><br>quote: <br>----<br>With Velious we decided to only sell the level 34 spells, and have the rest be drops on the continent. It was our intent to make these spells fairly common. Unfortunately some of these spells were a little too rare. We have addressed this by upping the 39 and 44 spell drops on the Test Server, this change should go live next patch. <br><br>- Lawrence Poe <br>-----<br><br>One of those spells is the Turning of the Unnatural.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000116.html"><b>Dynamic Changes/EverQuest Ingame Story</b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: I certainly would love to play in a world such as you describe. But many people wouldn't. There are a lot of EverQuest players that do not like the idea of allowing a GM to 'smite down' their characters, from on high or from below, with or without reason. << <br><br>We'll leave the discusion of "Dynamic Changes to the Environment" for another day, as I concede that the task is too large for the current incarnation of EQ...I bring it up mostly as a suggestion for future events. <br><br>The point you make above, however is a very, very valid concern. The same difficulty comes about in every P-N-P (pen and paper :)) RPG that I played. People feel very strongly when they invest time and effort into a character. It's very easy to see any permanent changes to that character as being an attack on the fruits of their labors. <br><br>People generally do not like for situations to get beyond what they consider to be a level of "their control", and some such people refuse to tolerate it. Many people like the security of knowing that the have determined: how they're going to play, that they know the risks, that they accept the risks, and as a result can move forward around the board toward whatever goal they have in mind. <br><br>It is, in fact, one of the things that makes EQ a wonderful game. I know (for example) that there are certain situations where I can advance and be reasonably assured that nothing catastrophic will happen to me. This allows me to spend time doing new, dangerous things, without feeling that I won't ever be able to recover. Dragon raids would be far less common if there was a chance that you could permanently end up in the Dragon's belly. (I believe in this sort of world, too, but it's definitely not EQ's ideology). <br><br>However, when you come to the concept of story, I think it's important to consider the role of a GM as a creator and "prime mover" for his/her world. Whenever someone plays a P-N-P RPG, to a certain extent they are empowering the Game Master to take action against their characters in order to support the storyline and to create a conflict for them to resolve. This can be driven by the GM's ideas for the game, or can come about as a consequence of their own actions. It is that "conflict" (be it a puzzling enigma, a challenging foe, or an adventurous discovery) that drives the story forward. In a sense, they give up some of the security they feel about their characters in exchange for a more dynamic experience, and (hopefully) a free enough hand to spin an entertaining story. If you don't accept the dangers outside of Hobbiton, you'll never experience the wonder of the Lonely Mountain. <br><br>Thus we come to my true point (long winded, aren't I?). I think that the people who would be more interested in a highly "Roleplay" oriented server are also the people who would be very willing to see the Game Masters have such Power. I believe they would (and ultimately MUST) be willing to accept that the GM's have creative control to whatever extents can be given. This allows the GM's the power to not only Roleplay effectively themselves, but to weave a storyline that is unique to their character experiences (with potential permanent consequences). It's accepted that the EQ world can't really be made dynamic, but it seems that many aspects of the Characters themselves COULD be affected (as long as such was within the context of a well-executed storyline). <br><br>Obviously, such a redefinition of "GM Powers" would have to be explained to someone going to such a server right from the start (in much the same way as the PvP servers have explanations associated with them). Each story seed that can be planted is another opportunity to Roleplay, and it seems that more dynamic capabilities (even those capable within the game engine today) would be a natural complement. <br><br>Again, more for you to chew on, as it's a subject that I'm (obviously) keenly interested in. <br><br>-Zekestrom of the Many Names ]</i></font><br><br>You sure are long winded! :)  But that's a good thing. <br><br>I've had this discussion before, on the old boards, with a player. In the end I think we agreed to disagree (though I also admit that I appear to be in the minority with this issue). I often feel somewhat cheated if I do something while roleplaying (pen and paper) that really deserved to get my character killed, and yet he survives. Happened just last weekend, though it wasn't me that made the mistake. One of us did something that should have gotten us all killed. While I certainly understand that killing the whole party could really crimp the game a bit, letting us live doesn't really make me happy either. It's hard to explain, but when I play, I fully expect the GM to kill my character when it's appropriate, when it would have happened if the characters were real. <br><br>When we don't suffer the 'realistic' penalties for our actions, the game world is a little less convincing. <br><br>Yes, I hate losing a good character. And, yes, I'll admit that most of the time I'd rather that the GM 'cheat' in our favor, especially when playing it out straight would mean starting all over or the end of the campaign. But if you play long enough and characters never suffer the true repercussions of their actions, the world that you're playing in gets less and less believable, and you are less and less likely to be afraid when your character <b>should</b> be afraid. <br><br>I do agree, though, that IF a server were set up wherein the GMs were given and expected to use their powers to enliven the game setting, even at the expense of some well deserved character deaths, that a warning to that effect would be needed. I also agree that I'd want to play on that server, very much. <br><br>The nice thing is that when you're in Norrath, no loss is truly permanent. Lost items and experience can be regained. So while some people are certainly upset at such losses, they are never going to be permanent by force of the game (some people might not bother to recover a lost item, though). Whereas if a pen and paper GM kills a character or destroys an item, such a thing can be permanent. So giving the GMs that added (and I agree necessary) freedom over the world and the player characters shouldn't be too intimidating, even to those that have never played a pen and paper roleplaying game. <br><br>See, I can be long winded too (and I held myself back!) :)<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, thank you for the reply to my comment. <br><br>I would agree that we (as players) have license to write our own story, create our character, and roleplay to that story, but what is lacking right now from this design is the ability to accurately perceive the story of Norrath, as a Civilization, as a World, and all that entails. <br><br>I would like to be able to respond, and more importantly, tailor the reactions of my character to the events that occur on a "Grand Scale". In order to do that, I would have to know more about the "living history" of Norrath as a civilization on a wordly scale. <br><br>What I mean about a Grand Scale and living history would be those events that have the tendacy to alter the fabric of Norrathian culture, environment, etc either temporararily (IE what's going on now with Good Ole' Bert, assuming it is temporary) or permantantly (I.E. the change in Undead spawning during the evening hours in Kithicor, or the Fabric that was torn to form a gateway to Hate when it first launched). <br><br>If I were able to know the events and storyline of what leads up to those moments, I would feel much more a part of the Norrathian history, and, thus, have more input to developing my character in response to those events. I understand that I may not have the possibility of directly influencing or triggering such events, but I'd very much like to be involved in them more then I am today (IE by actually knowing WHY they occur, when and how without scouring the internet for news, or talking to 500 NPCs). <br><br>I think an appropriate solution would be to record, publish and promote such events in the Roleplay way. For instance, as these events occur (or soon thereafter), record them in an RP manner (a gnome journalist witnessing an event, or a bard spinning a yarn of his experience during such events). Record them and then publish them. Then promote them in the way of News items on the Fan Sites, or at Harpy's Head. <br><br>I think I and many other folk would appreciate the effort of recording the details of the World History of Norrath and communicate them to the players in order to further enable us to develop our characters. <br><br>Sorry for the long post :)<br><br>Aloran Al`Aan<br>Tunare Server ]</i></font><br><br>It seems we're all long winded when we're on an interesting subject. :)<br><br>A lot of the details that people seek are available in game. I recently had a friend ask me what was up with the weird green mist in the Karanas. I asked him if he had asked any of the NPCs what was going on, or if he had even slowed down while running through the zone. He hadn't. <br><br>Now I will be the first to admit that there could be more of this sort of thing available in game. But I always hesitate about putting it up on a web site. How good is it to bypass the need for characters to actually go someplace in the game world to learn about what's going on? Something interesting going on in Halas? Rather than going to Halas and getting involved in it, people would just go to the web site and read about it&#8230; <br><br>I would much rather see something like a herald in most towns reporting local news than a web site doing so. <br><br>But I am also more interested in people knowing what's going on than I am in preserving my own notions of the right way and the wrong way to pass out that knowledge.<br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: Absor, <br><br>Your comments regarding the "story" of Everquest are, to a large extent, true. Each player writes their own stories as they play the game, etching a bit of themselves into Norrath's history. But I, like many other players, with that Verant would take a more active role in making Norrath a more dynamic place. <br><br>Take, for instance, the plague currently rolling through the Karanas. Word of this event got to me offline, and encouraged me to sign back on after I had stopped playing for a short while. The world is changing? That got me excited! The ongoing events leading up to that are a fascinating story and make the world feel all the more real, even if they did take far too long to unfold. It has led me to abandon the never-ending experience quest in lieu of exploring the world and talking to its denizens, something I have not done in some time. <br><br>Bloody Kithicor, an infamous world event if ever there was one, is an example of the kind of events that can make Norrath exciting. I was not around for Bloody Kithicor, having come on board shortly after. Reading about it from one involved player's point of view (read the fascinating tale here <a href="http://www.1fol.cjb.net">www.1fol.cjb.net</a>, under "We are at War") made me almost drool with the thought of the green mists leading to an event of this magnitude. <br><br>My point is this: GM Events are wonderful diversions and add a bit of flavor to the world, but they do little to make Norrath an ever-changing, unpredictable place. And Norrath must be ever-changing and unpredictable to sustain long term interest. Expansions fill that role, but there are only so many possible, eh? Not all events need be on the scale of Bloody Kithicor or what is happening in the Karanas, either. Just small things to add to the mystique of the world. <br><br>For instance, what if, for a month or two, the Kerrans decided to fight back against the Erudites? Change some of the Toxx spawns to Kerran warriors and such - a nightmare for those who've gotten bad faction. Add some new comments for NPCs to say regarding the Kerrans' attack, both in Toxx and the two appropriate cities. Maybe add a wandering Erudite guard or two to Toxx, so they can fight with Kerrans. Maybe a few temporary quests surrounding it, but those are 100 percent needed. Shortly thereafter, revert back to situation normal, with some lingering NPC comments about it for a few months afterwards. <br><br>What if the Qeynos guards discovered the activities in Fish's Ale and shut the place down for good? Burned it to rubble, leaving its shell in Qeynos forevermore? The city would never be the same. Some of the NPCs can remain in city in the general area. The city folk can talk about what happened. And maybe, just maybe, the workers at the establishment took up shop in the aqueducts, keeping the quests alive and in place. <br><br>In my opinion, each patch should bring some small but noticeable change to the world, some bigger that all will see, and others that only some. Simple changes in NPC comments alone would be a huge and very welcome addition to the game. Just that would be fantastic. <br><br>I know I've gone on for some time, but I'm sure I am not alone in this. I think the green mist in the Karanas has renewed interest in the actual world of Norrath, as has Luclin. I'd love to see Verant make it a living, breathing place. <br><br>Talmer [Winter Raven]<br>Ranger, Bristlebane Server ]</i></font><br><br>And I think most people would agree. Having the world change like that would be great. <br><br>But it's not as easy to do as you might think. The time it takes to come up with interesting events for the old world could just as easy be applied to new material. New material, such as Luclin, adds to the game world. The value of new content over changing old content is, well, new content adds to the volume of the 'stuff' in the world. For a long time player, that new content might have the same value as revising old content (making it 'dynamic'). But for the new player, who has never seen the old content, the fact that Qeynos is 'new' won't add much to the value of the game for them. Whereas new content is new for everyone. <br><br>And there is a lot more to making seemingly simple changes to zones. For example, burning down a bar in Qeynos would, basically, require rebuilding the zone (though not extensively, for certain). Any NPCs that talk about that bar in any portion of the game world would have to have their text revised. Any quests that too place in that bar would need re-working. And the players would have to download the whole zone. <br><br>Despite all that, I am in agreement with you, in theory at least. And I certainly understand how such things can make the game more exciting.<br><br><a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000119.html"><b>Questions about Cannibalize 2, 3 ,4 </b></a><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: According to every shaman I have talked to, every board I have read, each tiny bit of information I can scrape up, canabalize 4 does not drop anywhere, is not for sale anywhere, does not have a quest anywhere. <br><br>Was this done on purpose to torture the shaman community or is this just another glitch that needs fixed? Please let all of us know something on this topic. At the very least tell us we are all dim witted and need to look in such and such zone or something.

It seems to have about 5 or 6 lines of text in it but it vanishes before I can read what the text says.. It is not a Windows-generated error or confirmation box of any kind, and from what I am able to see it seems to have an "EQ style" appearance to it. From reading threads on several EQ boards it appears to be showing up on several other player's PC's as well but since it exists for such a short period most have likely missed it. Could you shed any light on what this box is? <br><br>Purifyre Morticus<br>Erollisi Marr ]</i></font><br><br><font color=#072876><i>[Quote: The issue is that someplace in the exit code it's trying to print text to the chat window, but that state of the user interface is not really valid at the time this occurs and it ends up redrawing the chat window area as if it's in the old non-fullscreen mode. So you get a flash of the parchment with some text on it just before the screen is updated with the character select or server select screen. <br><br>- Rowyl ]</i></font><br><br>So, basically, it's not subliminal advertising.

Helius Odysseus sent word of a new event taking place on Errolisi Marr:<BLOCKQUOTE>Roleplaying tournament on the E-marr Server!<br> <br>Comming up on May 5th, the Knights of the sword, a roleplaying guild on th E-marr server; will be sponsering a lvl 1-50 tournament in the Freeport Arena. Each group of participants will fight people within 5 lvls of themselves. <br>lvls 1-5<br>6-10<br>11-15<br>16-20<br>21-25<br>26-30<br>31-35<br>36-40<br>41-45<br>46-50<br> <br>I can not say that every category will have people in it, I hope it will, but that is only an assumption. My members will provide booze and entertainment afterwards, during the awards ceremony. <br>Awards will be given to the 1st place participant in each category. <br> <br>There will be judges determining what categories "twinks" go into. We don't want a lvl 5 warrior with 200str fighting a lvl 4 paladin in leather armor. The judges will determine all the levels. <br> <br>1pp entry fee, going up by 2pp every category. i.e. lvls 1-5 pay 1pp, lvls 11-15 pay 3pp.<br>Cash prizes will be given out, as well as some items. Please if you don't want to come fight, come watch. Role playing will be encouraged through out the whole match. Attempting to get a guide or possibly GM to watch the event.<br> <br>Thank you,<br>Helius Odysseus, Leader of the sword. </BLOCKQUOTE>Good luck with the event!
