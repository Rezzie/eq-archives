Aeko informed me of the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>Greetings!<P>I am putting together a gathering of as many paladins as possible for this coming Sunday, the 5th of March, to raid Mistmoore Castle for our Soulfire hilts and other pieces needed by paladins for their Ro armor. I have spoken individually with some 20 paladins, most of whom have expressed desire to try and make our gathering, and several more have expressed interest on the various paladin message boards. It shall be something of a "Get to know your Fellow Paladin" day as well; booze will be provided in great quantities, and we shall have as much fun as possible camping every available nook and cranny in MM, not to mention pulling the evil Troll SK with our prized hilt to the zone every time he spans to slap him flat! All paladins of the Tribunal server are invited, although the majority of respondents so far appear to be between the levels of 30 and 45 or so. (I suspect our plane-travelling bretheren are on a raid this weekend, but we shall hold the fort in their absense).<P>We shall begin our gathering about noon on Sunday, and will camp the sk all day. Join us if you can -- it'll be fun!<P>Peace!<P>Aeko<br>32nd season Paladin<br>Leader, Court of the Crosswinds</BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you!

An important new message is now being displayed on the Patch Server:<UL>March 2nd, 6:30pm<br>------------------------<P>***Additional Server Migrations***<P>Tonight, during primetime hours, we will again be opening the registration log on Fennin Ro to allow another batch of people to request an account-move to the new server, Druzzil Ro.  In addition, we will also be opening the logs on Solusek Ro and Xegony, allowing some of the people on those two servers to move to Druzzil Ro as well. <P>All of the information contained in the patch message from February 25th (below) still applies to Fennin Ro and also applies to Solusek Ro and Xegony.  <P>The opening of the registration logs will be announced via an in-game broadcast tonight.<P>Clarification on a few items:<P>1.  If you are selected for the move, all of your characters on your account currently on the affected server will be moved.  You do not need to log in each character and execute the command like many people did for the first character migration.<P>2.  Please keep in mind that there will be no special consideration given in the move process in reference to groups, friends, or guilds.  There is a good change that you will be separated from your friends, and it is recommended that you DO NOT REGISTER for the move unless this is not a problem for you.  This is also true for people who have characters on multiple accounts.3.  Since people are being moved from multiple servers, if you are moved there is a possibility that your character's name may be changed in order to resolve any duplicates.  If a letter "X" is appended to your character's name on Druzzil, you may contact a GM in-game to change your name to one of your preference.<P>4.  REMEMBER! As stated below, CORPSES WILL NOT BE TRANSFERRED. If you are moved and your character leaves a corpse behind, the items on the corpse will be lost and will not be subject to reimbursable.<P>-The EverQuest Team</UL>

It's something we can definitely keep in mind for future products.

Verant's Internet Relations Manger, the one and only Gordon Wrinn, made several posts today on the Gameplay board.  Here's the scoop:<UL><b>Journeyman Boots</b><br>What's happening is that he's getting stuck on a rock, and due to that he's not finishing his script that allows him to depop. So yes, killing him is one way to get him off the rock. A GM or Guide should be able to lure him off the rock as well assuming that he's stuck. Usually, after being stuck there long enough he'll find his way off the rock. <P>Of course the long term plan is for us to make it so that he doesn't get stuck on the rock. I'll see what we can do along these lines.<P>Server Transfers, Server CapsWe are absolutly opposed to capping server population, as we feel that it does more harm than good. New people join the game and want to play with their friends, and they can't do that if we've capped the server. <P>Secondly, as people leave a new server, people have to be allowed to move in and take their place. A healthy server economy needs newbies, mid-levels, and 50s. Yes, I'm basically saying that the economy isn't healthy on a brand new server until we see the proverbial bell curve. Luckily the "Racers" move in and help a new server obtain that balance within a couple of months.<P><b>Age and Maturity (Brought up by someone wanting a server for more "mature" players)</b><br>Age isn't exactly a reliable factor to determine maturity in an environment with a high perception of anonymity. I've met 12 year-olds more mature than some 40 year-olds.<P><b>The "Next" Patch Day</b><br>Probably not next week, but the week after. Don't quote me on that yet.<P><b>Lullaby Bugged?</b><br>[After reviewing some evidence posted on the thread] I spoke to Geoff about the original author's tests. It looks like there might be *something* strange going on, but we'll have to run some more tests in House. Geoff will take another look at it after he gets done with the first draft of the expansion spells in the next few days.<P><b>The Phantom Armor Series</b><br>Poor GZ was unavailable for a good deal of time last week. He was in the Hospital from a spider bite. In fact, if anyone going to the gathering in St. Louis this weekend would be so kind as to tease him with a rubber spider, I'd be eternally grateful :)<P>Anyway, we do have the ability to make the spell make you look like you are wearing plate, but that would just lead to every magician above the required level looking like shadowknights or paladins. <P>GZ did say that he'd be willing to look into applying another effect to the phantom series to make it more worthwhile.<P><b>Kunark Box Issues</b><br>There are actually two versions of the box. The first run had a typo and said "five", the second run is correct, and says "three". The number of zones in the 3 continent world is actually higher than what was planned for the 5 continent world. This was all decided about May or June of '98. <P>So no, the expansion is not "bogus". It contains additional content that wasn't included with the original game.<P><b>Druid Expansion Spells</b><br>I should mention that it's entirely too early to be screaming "rebellion!". Spells for the expansion are a Work-in-Progress and hardly a complete list. <P>I won't be commenting specifically on them any time soon.<br>--<br>Of course you all can expect that the spells will be adjusted prior to the release of the expansion. That's the purpose of the beta. If anyone screams "NERF!" when an unofficial, unreleased, beta spell that no one has and only knows about through the use of one of those parser programs, I'm going to bang my head against my monitor.</UL>

Gordon Wrinn responded to a post on the Gameplay forum regarding the upcoming server transfers.  Here's the thread:<UL>One question that comes to mind about bringing in players from Solusek Ro and Xegony to Druzzil Ro is that of duplicate character names. There will very likely be a few duplicate names found from server to server, and this may create problems when migrating accounts from servers other than Fennin Ro. <P><B><I>Yes, we are aware of the issue of possible duplicates, and that will be addressed in the patch message that will go up soon. Basically, it's announced that people who choose to move might need a name change on their character to resolve a duplicate issue, and if this occurs, an "X" will be appended to their name. In the event they have an "X" appended to their name, they may contact a GM in-game and get the name changed to something they pick. </b></i><P>Also, the original Fennin split was capped at 1200 accounts. Will tonights registration use different, lower caps? (ie, 300 accounts from each?). <P><b><i>The number of people we are moving is much smaller than it was yesterday. Ideally, yesterday 100% of the people we moved would have been represented in peak usage. As a side effect though, people who played off-peak logged on and executed the command. In addition, there are also people with multiple accounts that executed the command for each account. As a result, the amount of "peak usage" that was moved was less than we would have liked. Comparing the number moved to the amount of peak usage moved allowed us to estimate the outcome future moves and help us move the right number. </b></i><P>Keep adding new non-split servers (300 copies of the game sold each day -> new servers every other week just to keep up). <b><i><P>It doesn't quite work like that. First, of the new users we attract, roughly 30% play at peak. There's also the fact that people also leave the game.</b></i><P> FINISH the Fennin split first.<P>Once that split is DONE, then see if there's more room for overflow off other servers. <P><b><i>The problem with this is that each split means that the server must be down for an extended period. This goes for the source as well as the destination server. We want to limit the number of people negatively affected by the split, hence we are doing a few at once. <P>-Gordon</b></i></UL>Thanks Andrew!

The following report was sent in to us by Crier Sharpsong:<BLOCKQUOTE>In an extraordinary display of coordination, effort and dedication, twoof the major guilds that made the transfer from Fennin Ro to the brandnew Druzzil Ro made their presence known to the denizens of the newserver last night by slaying both Lord Nagafen and Lady Vox. The formerFennin Ro guild Seekers of Norrath dispatched Lord Nagafen approximately45 minutes after the guild Mythic Legion took down Lady Vox. This taskwas made more difficult by the lack of /guildsay and the loss of a fewmembers of both guilds due to non-transfer. A GM for the new Druzzil Rowas present as a spectator at both events, and was supportive of ourcollective efforts.<P>With only 600 people on the server at peak time, the new Druzzil Roserver was everything that we had hoped that it would be. Thepopulation of Lower Guk was 25 and Sol B 19. The number of level 1-4players was quite high, which is to be expected when any new server isset up, but unlike any other new server there were many characters withlevels all the way to 50. Although many of our dear friends were leftbehind during the move (and sadly a few guildmates as well), theunanimous results from the informal poll that I took last night was thateveryone was ecstatic with their new playing conditions.<P>Thanks to Verant for setting up a new server and allowing a transfer,and thanks to all of the players that make EverQuest such a great gameto play. We will deeply miss our old friends from Fennin Ro that wehave spent 11 months playing alongside, but the move increase theelbow-room for everyone on both servers.<P>Crier Sharpsong<br>Seekers of Norrath<br>47th Song Bard on Druzzil Ro</BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks for letting us know!<P>And remember, our new <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/board.asp?brd=5181">Druzzil Ro Message Board</a> is a great place to meet, plan and discuss topics and issues of the Druzzil Ro server!

And, following in the tradtion of other high-budget trailers, here is a clip that leaves you dying to know what the hell is going on and why it is happening in the first place! <blockquote>Sorry, but the technique is a secret, passed down through many generations of my African ancestors from the great tribal chieftan himself, Momama Mojamba. Were I to reveal the secret, mighty Momama's wrathful spirit would descend upon me like a Japanese elevator on Venus. No, seriously, I just use the standard Max 1.2 UVW map modifier (I have to use 1.2 because our in-house plug-ins were written for that version of the software), the shape of which depends on the shape of the object that I'm mapping.</blockquote> With a special introductory price of only one mouseclick, you too can see what EQ fans sometimes rave about.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Verant's Gordon Wrinn was on the boards in force today.  Here's his latest volley of board posts:<UL><b>Ring of the Dead (Item that allowed non-casters to bind)</b><br>It was removed because it was out-of-character for a melee class to have the item. It was decided a long time ago that only the pure casters would have the ability to bind anywhere. <P><b>More 'No Drop' Items Coming</b><br>I think we'll see more new items become NODROP as the game progresses. NODROP solves a lot of problems, but also creates some others. Given the choice, I'd rather see the "Lore for Life" tag that was suggested by a few people a while ago. We brought that up and unfortuneatly it's not something that could go in. At least not without a Pwipe, which I imagine would upset a few people :)<P><b>On Announcing Item Removals</b><br>We have on occasion made exeptions to what we've announced just to head off the complaints that come whenever we remove something. We didn't, for example, announce the removal of the Manastone until people noticed it on their own.<P><b>Money Troubles</b><br>I think that it's possible that some of the new quests might be going overboard on the cash requirements if the assumption is made that the server economy is healthy in the first place. Perhaps after we run like this for a while, and we can see the impact of the changes that have been made on old server economies as well as newer servers (such as Lanys and Luclin), we might reevaluation the prices of some of the quests.<P><b>SK Quests</b><br>We currently have several quests in the works to match non-plane SK weaponry up with the Paladin stuff, to a certain extent. Two of those quests were supposed to go in the week before last but weren't quite ready for primetime. Just be aware that we do consider this an issue and are making forward progress with it.<P><b>Spell hotkey bug - Will victims get refunded?</b><br>Being honest, no, we can't refund you. There's no way to determine whether or not the charge was used intentionally. As such, it would be fruitless for our GM staff to try. We'd be better off sticking an NPC in the world that auto-recharged items, as doing it manually would take time that could better be spent helping people with gameplay damaging issues. Our apologies for those adversely affected.<P><b>On Fennin Ro Transfer</b><br>It's possible that we might open the gates again and move a couple hundred more people, but its too soon to comment on that to any great extent. We'll have to see how server population pans out after the servers are back. <P>I wouldn't count on it though as both servers will probably have an influx of newer characters that will probably fill up any population gaps.<br>--<br>I think it is a little too soon to call it a disaster. <br>--<br>Maybe someone said something that I'm not aware of, but who promised advance notice? If it truly was promised and was not extended, then yes you deserve an apology. <P>Now I can understand why advance notice might not have been given the second time around: As I mentioned above, we wanted to move our peak crowd, not the crowd that logged on at peak in hopes of executing the command. <P>It is inevitable that some people who want to be moved won't be when the server comes back up. This would be true regardless of the procedure used to complete the move. If we had left registration opened for 24 hours we would have had the same problem. <P>As it is, we wanted to move the peak load, and as such the announcement was made during peak hours. There is a finite number of people that could be moved that wouldn't result in an extraordinarily large number on the new server. <P>Yes, regardless what happens there will be people upset about the way the move was done. To them, we apologize.<P><b>Weapons and Creatures</b><br>We have the ability to make them spawn with weapons, but anything that can equip a weapon can be handed another weapon. The creature will then choose which weapon that it would rather equip based upon several factors. <P><b>Windows2000 and EQ</b><br>It works fine, you just have to make sure you have all of the latest drivers. <P>Zones Geared Toward Players Who SoloBeing completely honest with you, this would be at odds with most of what EQ stands for. Since people in general have a tendency to follow the path of least resistance, everyone and their brother would be in these zones, and there'd be no way to control it. <P>EQ is and will remain a group-oriented game, where people can choose a soloable class if they like. But though they'll be able to advance, they cannot expect to get the best items fighting exclusivly solo. <P><b>In-game Communication</b><br>Well we do need to be mindful of the total bandwidth that the game consumes. Excess communications usually doesn't become a problem in MUDs because of the relativly small subscriber load. <P>The only thing currently in our short term plans is the /ftell function, allowing you to send a message to everyone on your friends list. <P><b>More on the Casual Player</b><br>I agree completely with the original author. <P>A person who is focused on leveling as fast as they can while acquiring the best items is a powergamer, even if they have only an hour per day to play the game. <P>Likewise, someone who plays the game 16 hours per day can still be a "casual gamer". In fact I know a mid-30s Druid with over 75 days /played that would fit into this description very well. <P>It seems to me that many of the posts here are arguing that people should be able to do the same things and acquire the same items in the same calendar time regardless how much they play, and without regard to their play-style. This just isn't going to happen. People who invest more time in the game have a reasonable expectation to acquire "more" than someone who invests less. It's a simple facet of a massively-multiplayer game, and it is reasonable. The only way around it would be to make everyone level at the same calendar-rate regardless how much time they spend in game, and that would just be awful. <P>Even if we did come up with a way to even things out for the time-starved powergamer, where do we place the cut-off? The person who plays 25 hours per week wants the same benefits as the person who plays 75. What of the person who plays 10? or 5? Where is the reasonable expectation? <P>You *can* play less than 1 hour per day and advance all the way to 50. It's just going to take a *long* time. What is the fundamental flaw with this design? In what way is it not fair that someone who spends more time playing the game levels faster (by the calendar) and acquires more items?<P><b>Tinkering and Other Trade Skills</b><br>Tinkering can definitely use an update and I'll see if I can get it on the list. I'd like to see more useful items out there that come from Tinkering, but the problem is avoiding things that tread on a class ability to any great extent. <P>As to a couple of other questions that I've seen in here, the tattered gnomish cloak isn't in game anywhere at this time, and I here that the gemcutter has *some* use, but not to the extent that some suppose.<P><b>Ruins of Kunark Issues</b><br>You've made some very valid points, not the least of which is your statement about overcrowding being the root to most of the "casual gamer" complaints. I think that before we can make a lot of progress with a bunch of "what if" arguments, we really need to get a handle on the crowding issue and get the expansion out. <P>The expansion will add tons of new areas which were created by people who play the game actively and understand what the players expect as well as what they want. These zones are in many ways much better than the zones of EQ Proper, and can hold a larger number of people in each zone without them stepping on each others toes. In addition to all of this, many of the new areas in the expansion are geared towards the higher level people who've hit that ceiling and run out of things to do from their perspective. Imagine how nice the world will be when 90% of the people above 45 run off to the new land to do something else besides Lower Guk and Solb :)<br>--<br>I think a certain amount of crowding in some areas is unavoidable in the first few days after Kunark is discovered, but people should spread out fairly quickly, like when they realize that no-one is camping SolB or LGuk :)<br>--<br>Though the system reqs will be increased *for the expansion, EQ Proper must continue to work for the originally published specs. As such, we'll have to see how much texture memory we have left after adding the Iksar-related stuff before we can commit to how much individuality can be added. Anything that a character can equip or wear must exist in all zones, and as such we are restricted by the lowest common denominator of the old EQ system requirements. <P>Now, on Kunark, the land, and creatures in the zones will have more varied and complex textures than you see in the world now. This is possible because those items can only be viewed by people who bought the expansion thereby agreeing to the new system requirements.</UL>All spotted on the Gameplay board.

EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid made three posts recently on the Gameplay forum about the burnout phenomenon and other issues related to the life span of a game like EQ.  Here's the posts:<UL><I>Let's look at some facts: <P>EverQuest currently is not being advertised, either on the web or in print. <P>Other than the occasional in-store promotion, EQ pretty much just sits on the basic shelves at the various stores along with all the other older software. <P>EQ was the second best selling game at Electronics Botique in 1999, beaten only by Tiberian Sun. <P>EQ continues to sell between 500 and 800 units EVERY DAY. This has been true for some time. <P>So 40 (MAYBE in that one doesn't yet have to use one's EQ account name to post) of 189,932 EQ players post that they wouldn't reccomend EQ to their friends, yet they still go out of their way to frequent EQ's message board and make posts. <P>Meanwhile EQ sells 500-800 units every day with no advertising and minimal promotions. <P>Hrm, just where now are these 500 people every day hearing about EQ and why are they deciding to buy it? <P>Could it be... their friends? <P>Yes, I see a pattern. <P>-Brad</i></UL>Here's the second:<UL><b>How good is that word of mouth going to be in a few more weeks, or months, as more and more people hear from these 40?</b><P>Oshlarian, people have been complaining about EQ and how it's doomed and how as soon as another MMORPG comes out everyone will leave and how they're going to tell everyone that EQ sucks, etc. for MONTHS. <P>40 of you? There are probably hundreds of people who feel the way you do. EQ isn't for everyone. Some people don't like EQ right away, some people don't like it after they play 8 hours a day for months, earn a 50th level character, and then email me about how Verant sucks and the game design behind EQ is horrible, and then there's the vast majority of players who just keep on playing and having fun. <P>It's pretty normal. When you have 189,000 players you're going to have all types. Even the type that seems to hang around this message board the most... the players who just like to complain, yet keep on playing. It's not unique to EQ by any means, though. They are there on UO boards, they were around when I used to MUD a lot (heck, I was part of that crowd for a while on the MUD I played big time on). <P><b>Now I understand that this is your game, but a game in not really any good without players, and your company's policies and attitudes are alienating those very players.</b><P>Like I said, I'm sure we are alienating some players with our decisions. It's inevitable. You can't please everyone all the time. But one of our biggest problems right now is overcrowding, which is the result of waaaay more people playing EQ than we ever thought would play, especially almost a year after its launch. Were our policies and decisions negatively affecting even a small but significant portion of our player base, overcrowding would not be an issue. <P><b>The arbitrary and high handed actions of some of the people working at Verant has caused quite a backlash of anger among many of us here, because there seems to be little concern for the customer after purchase. <P>It "Seems" that once you get your 50 bucks for the game, you consider the $10 a month gravy, and could care less if you get it or not. <P>Now this may not be your attitude, but it dose seem to be the attitude of some of the people working for you.</b><P>I assure you it is neither my attitude nor the people working for me. With all due respect, the notion that we only care about the revenue from the initial box sale and not about the monthly subscription costs is ludicrous at best. If we cannot keep people subscribing to EverQuest the game will go away. Personally, I want to keep making these games (MMORPGs) for quite a long time so it's certainly deeply in my interest that EQ is and remains profitable. And, like I mentioned earlier, if we have a problem at all, it's that too many people are buying the game and staying subscribed to it (the overcrowding issue) :)<P><b>We have asked simple questions and been told.. in effect "You don't Need to Know.." <P>This is not acceptable behavior for a customer support group. at least give us something to go on here. Please?</b><P>I must disagree. There are many questions that we should not answer, just like when playing AD&D there are many questions and details the DM will not reveal. <P><b>1 What Basic (no formulas required) effects do stats have on melee combat?</b><P>I believe this has been answered to an extent by Abashi in the past. We are not going to reveal anything more than he already has because we don't want to spoil the game. I encourage you to experiment yourself with different item configurations and to draw your own conclusions. You see, experimenting with different item configurations is PART of EQ's gameplay as per design. If we reveal the details it ruins an aspect of gameplay, just as spoiler sites that post the solutions to quests also ruin aspects of EQ's gameplay. <P><b>2 Why can Mob's attack through solid walls, and we can't?</b><P>I have answered this in the past, and am more than happy to do so again :)<P>When designing and implementing the engine behind EQ we had to make many sacrifices. Computer game creation is often confronted with these choices, because one is always limited by the performance available in terms of hardware and software. <P>So here's your answer: In order to create large outdoor zones in a 3D world and have our servers run at an acceptable level of performance we had to turn off server side collision detection for many outdoor objects. <P><b>Oshlarian asked:3 What are you going to do about the over crowding/camping issues?</b><P>Well, according to you and the other 40 people this shouldn't be a problem, no? People should be leaving this horrible game in droves :)<P>But seriously, here's what we have planned: <P>More servers (the next server will be the Fennin Ro split -- yes, it's late -- we are still working on the scripts and infrastructure necessary to make this transition). <P>We will be launching the Expansion April 24th, which will increase the size of Norrath by about 33%. <P>We are working on revamping existing dungeons such that the spread of players is more evenly distributed amongst the zones we do have. Basically, we need to get players into the several underpopulated dungeons (Najena, Permafrost, Kerra Ridge, Mistmoore, etc). <P><b>And please don't take that as a threat, it is meant as a bit of advice from someone that really loves this game.</b><P>I appreciate that and understand it as well. In fact, that's why I'm here addressing these issues and trying to answer your questions :)<P>I know that most of the people who complain here really do love EQ, or at least loved it for quite some time. As I mentioned earlier, I used to complain a lot in a MUD I used to play. I put about 60 days of playing time into my level 50 Ranger there. After a while I'd question any little change the people who ran that game made, especially if it affected me or my friends in any way. And though I'd play the game for hours every night, I'd spend some of that time complaining and whining. <P>I think perhaps this is inevitable in this genre, or at least while this genre is fairly new. People aren't used to playing a game for MONTHS, investing huge amounts of time into it. Most single player games you buy, take home, and either you discover you don't care for it right away and shelf it/return it, or you enjoy it and play it quite a bit for a few weeks until you complete it. With a MMORPG you end up investing an order of magnitude more time into it. Couple that with the fact that these games change and evolve and can be patched and that you have the opportunity to be heard by the creators of that game, and you end up with a small, vocal group who is constantly complaining and trying to bring attention to themselves. <P>I understand completely the personal investment our playerbase has made and the passion and attachment they have. I also understand completely that 'familiarity breeds contempt' and that the more you play a game like this, the more the little, minor problems that you ignored at first begin to bother you more and more. I also understand that nobody wants their character's class nerfed, or the item they worked for hours to obtain changed negatively, even if the change is for the overall good and balance of the game. <P>But I really submit that some of this phenomenon is inescapable due to the nature of this genre. I'm just hoping that a lot of it is because most people aren't used to the genre. Of the 189,000 people who play EQ, how many have played a game like this before? Maybe half of them played UO? Maybe. And before that? Probably very few (overall, MUDs have never been very popular, probably due to their text based nature). MMORPGs are sooo different than single player games (and so much better, IMHO :)I think they'll take a bit to get used to. <P>That, and future MMORPGs will be that much better too! Remember, EQ is part of the first generation of these games. In my opinion, we've only just scratched the surface here. EQ, UO, and AC are only the tip of the iceberg. Personally, I'm very excited to be part of this new and emerging industry, because we've only just begun. <P><b>(I didn't realize that until someone here pointed out to me, that we complain the most about things we care about. Many here have since denied it, but I think "They doth protest too much" to paraphrase "THE BARD")</b><P><P>Agreed. <P>Thanks very much for your comments. <P>-Brad</UL>And now the third post:<UL><i>Preface: I had to think about whether to respond again to this thread, because trying to communicate one of the points I'm trying to make (I touched on it in my second post on this thread) may be futile. I say this because when I was burned out after playing a MUD I used to play a lot (over 2 years, 50+ days invested) I don't know if I would have acknowledged the problem, at least not initially (I did figure it out over time, after thinking about the phenomenon a lot, and wondering and planning how EQ would deal with it). <P>But, what the heck, I'll go for it. You guys can agree or disagree, but this is my analysis of the MMORPG burnout phenomenon: <P>First, a few assertions: <P>1. Game lifespan. Games like EQ, UO, the better MUDs out there, etc. generally hold people's attention MUCH longer than conventional games. I'm talking about the players who enjoy the game initially, of course, not the ones who decide they don't like it in the first week or so and then return it/shelf it. Generally, the longer a person is associated with something and the more time invested, the more attached he or she gets. So it's pretty safe to say that players who really get into MMORPGs become VERY attached to them, and the longer they play, the more attached. <P>2. Patching. MMORPGs can and are patched. They evolve and change. When you buy a conventional game you know that what you bought is pretty much what you have. There may be a few maintenance patches that fix bugs, and there may be an expansion in the game's future if the game is successful, but still, overall, the game is the game. Not so, of course, with MMORPGs. Features are added, content is added, game balance is adjusted (be it via enhancements or 'nerfs'), etc. The player KNOWS that the game COULD be, over time, made into something EXACTLY what he or she is looking for. At least in theory an MMORPG could evolve over time into the 'perfect' game, at least for one player (obviously not for everyone, because one player has different needs and wants than another player -- the old 'you can't please everyone all the time' adage applies here). <P>3. 'Familiarity breeds contempt'. People get burnt out of just about anything in life. Some things take longer to grow weary of, but eventually just about everything grows old. As another poster wrote, and I paraphrase, 'no game has infinite playability.' I'm sure different people have different expectations, some realistic and perhaps others not so realistic, as to how long a game like EQ 'should' hold their attention, but, regardless, nobody expects EQ or any other MMORPG to hold their interest forever. It's also pretty safe to say that a flaw in something or someone can remain hidden, overlooked, or flat out ignored if the overall package is generally a good one. For example, if I buy a new car and it has a few problems, but overall it's what I wanted, then I'll probably ignore the problem (at least initially). But, over time, as the newness of the car wears off, as I get accustomed to the 'good' the car offers me, the problem(s) tends to get more and more annoying, until eventually, sometimes, it's all that's on my mind. After a while, every time you hop in your car that damn lump in the seat becomes more and more uncomfortable. Well, perhaps that's not the best analogy of all time, but you get the picture. <P>4. Ease of communication with the dev team. Well, here we are. Gordon posts here, I read and sometimes post, and quite a few of the other dev team members are lurkers. You can complain and say we don't post enough, or that we don't listen to your needs, or that our customer service isn't robust enough, etc., but the fact is, here I am at 10:54 pm, at home, posting to a public message board frequented by EQ players, attempting to communicate and address an issue. Criticize, flame, yell and scream, but we're here, trying. This isn't always possible with games (or many other consumer products, for that matter) and while it isn't necessarily unique to MMORPGs, I think it's fair to say that this genre as a whole makes more of an overall effort to set up communication channels with its player base (it really makes sense, because being an online only genre we can assume that our player base would tend to by internet savvy, familiar with message boards, usenet, etc.). (Disclaimer: I know there are other developers out there making non-MMORPGs who post, do chats, write .plan files, etc., so please don't take offense at this assertion - none is meant - I'm definitely generalizing). <P>Conclusion: Many players will, after a significant period of time, become 'burnt out', disenchanted, etc. with an MMORPG. Although the player started playing the MMORPG and really liked it, over time those little nagging problems became significant issues for him. He communicated his wishes and comments to the dev team and they didn't respond and/or implement his suggestions, even though they could have. This is upsetting to the player. He really cares deeply about the game, he KNOWS the problems he has could be addressed via patching, and he KNOWS the dev team is listening. So the game he wholeheartedly supported, loved, and recommended early on slowly evolves into more of a love/hate relationship. He's still addicted, he's invested a LOT of time into his character and the items his character possesses, but at the same time he's becoming more and more frustrated with the developers and maintainers of this game, because, after all, they COULD address his issues. And, of course, every time he experiences one of the problems he has with the game, whether it's a bug or something intentional he deems a design flaw, it bothers him more and more. He probably didn't notice the problem at first, or if he did, he ignored it in that it was dwarfed by the overall newness of the game. But now&#8230; now it's really on his nerves. <P>I submit this phenomenon I've described rarely if EVER happens with conventional, single player games because at least three if not four of the assertions I made above are not applicable to most games. This phenomenon is therefore relatively new (although it's common with MUDs and has been happening for years, MUDs have never been mainstream and I'd say probably 95% of EQ players, for example, have never played a MUD, much less been addicted to one). It's new, but it's not going away. As I mentioned in my previous post, this genre is still in its infancy. EQ, UO, AC, etc., I still consider FIRST generation MMORPGs. And while they're all great games I think it's safe to say that the second and third generation MMORPGs will blow away the earlier ones. We will learn from our mistakes, we will have better technology, we will have more support and bigger budgets, etc. And because of all this, I think we can somewhat reduce this burnout phenomenon, or at least make it such that it takes LONGER for the average player to become burnt out or disenchanted. <P>See, I get it. I've been there. I've experienced it. At one point I'd play maybe three or four hours a night, have a blast 90+% of the time, but spend the other percentage *****ing with my guildmates as to how poor decisions were being made by the MUD's admins, how we were running out of high level content and needed more zones, how one class wasn't balanced relative to the others, etc. I LOVED the game, but after a while I didn't care much for the admins. When they changed something I didn't agree with it affected me PERSONALLY because I had a huge personal attachment both to the game and to my character (level 50 ranger, 50+ days played, tons of very hard to get, rare items, etc). How DARE they make a change that affected ME adversely, regardless of the fact that it was to maintain their overall vision of the game, or their long term plans, or to preserve a semblance of overall game balance. <P>Ok, so if this is an inescapable phenomenon, if it's only a matter of time before many or most players experience it, then what can we do? What can the players do? What can the developers do? Well, that's why I wrote the preface to this post: I'm not sure if an explanation will help. I'm not sure how many players can step away and analyze the situation and at least understand it. Like I said, at the time this was happening to me I don't think I could have. It took time, it took looking at it from a third person perspective (which I was trying to do because we were designing EQ at the time and I wanted to avoid the mistakes of the past), and most of all, it took experience in the genre (i.e. playing these kinds of games for a long time, looking at other MUDs, reading what others were saying about other MUDs, etc.) So my hope is that as the genre matures so also will the player base (I really don't mean that in a condescending way, so please don't take it as such). I hope that players will recognize what is happening and remember it when communicating to the developers. I hope the developers will recognize it and double their efforts to communicate to their players and to address players' needs and issues. I hope that some players will know when to quit (or at least take a break), preferably BEFORE they get so upset that they flame, insult personally, and swear never to buy a game from developer X ever again. I also hope that the players will still recommend the game they had so much fun with to others, but at the same time warning their newbie associates about this phenomenon, about the intense personal attachment and passion that often accompanies these games, and the signs of burn out and disenchantment of which to be wary. Lastly, I hope that players will over time realize that while the game can indeed be patched and changed, that the developers must consider the overall health of the game and make changes accordingly. <P>As I finish this up, let me leave generalizations and references to the genre as a whole and switch to EverQuest specifically. In other words, how does all of this relate to EQ today? Well, I think EQ has a very bright future ahead of it. I think there is a lot we have yet to accomplish, a huge world we can expand, tons of new features, quests, items, and NPCs we can add, and more. I look at UO and I see a game with 150,000 subscribers over two years after it's release. Regardless of how I feel about that game's design, issues, and problems, that is VERY respectable. EQ has been out almost a year now and it's still growing like crazy. It is by far the most successful online only game of all time (we are closing in rapidly on the 200,000 subscriber mark). A huge Expansion to the game is about to be released, increasing the size of the world by over 30%, upping the quality of the graphics and other details, and adding a new playable race. The vast majority of players who've ever played EverQuest are STILL playing! (Contrary to another post and some incorrect data, significantly less than 30% total have quit over the 11 months EQ has been out). And again, one of the origins of our problems (overcrowding) is because, despite no formal marketing in MONTHS, the game continues to sell (primarily because of word of mouth). All in all, people LOVE EQ, they can't stop playing it, and they tell their friends to buy it. <P>But yes, there are problems. The game is hardly perfect. There are game mechanics that could and will be improved over time. There are overcrowding issues that will, over time, be addressed. There are the changes we'll have to make in the future to maintain balance and the overall health of the game that will upset some players, affecting them directly and adversely. And there are people both leaving the game as well as those who haven't left but who are becoming burnt out and disenchanted, either with the game or with us, or both. And many of this latter category post on this message board. <P>So what are we going to do about it? Well, let me assure you that while I think this phenomenon is in many ways inevitable and unavoidable, we're still going to do everything in our power to minimize it. As I mentioned in my earlier post it is absolutely in our interest that as many players keep subscribing as possible. You can interpret that as base greed, self-preservation, the desire to be able to keep making games like this and fulfill our dreams, or all three (which is probably closest to the truth), but it's true nonetheless. We want to make as many of you happy as often as possible and for as long as possible. <P>So here's the plan: we will continue to listen, we will continue to post, we will continue to try to explain our positions and to gather great ideas from our player base. We will launch servers as fast as we are able in order to keep overcrowding down (and no, regardless of how hard we try, that probably won't be fast enough for many of you). We will launch our first Expansion in late April, increasing the size of the world and hopefully breathing a breath of fresh air into the world of Norrath. We will continue to adjust, maintain, balance, and add features to the client and server. We will continue to add new quests, items and NPCs. We will re-tune and revamp existing areas and zones in an attempt to spread people out and entice them to enjoy ALL of Norrath's adventure areas. And, longer term than that, we have some other pretty nifty EQ related projects in the works, whether they be expansion, sequels, or what have ya. Verant is definitely in this for the long term. I hope you all hang with us and keep the faith. I hope that you keep playing EQ and enjoy the upcoming Expansion. But if you need to take a break, please do. And if you want to try our competition, please do. By all means play the game you have the most fun with - as I posted some weeks ago, life is too short to play a game you're not really enjoying. No game is right for everyone, and no matter how hard we try there will always be people who disagree with the direction we are taking the game or the decisions we are making. With 195,000+ players I'm sure statistically there are hundreds, if not thousands, who are burnt out and disenchanted. And that number will probably grow over time. And I think that's at least somewhat inescapable, even though we're going to try our damndest to make that statistic as low as possible. <P>Ah well, that's pretty much it - we're doing our best, and we'll get better. If you still enjoy EQ, stick around, 'cause you ain't seen nothin' yet. But if you're starting to get that sour taste in your mouth, letting the game affect you personally, or getting steaming mad at us, well then, step back, think about what I've said please, see if it's applicable to you, and make your decision. Maybe understanding why you're feeling what you are will help, maybe not. Heck, maybe you think I'm just full of it :)In any case, keep the feedback and the constructive criticism coming, 'cause we're both listening and not going away :)<P>'nuff said. <P>-Brad</i></UL>Thanks Gordon! :)

<a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/">The Dojo</a>, an EverQuest Monk site, has <a href="http://thedojo.extropian.org/misc/interview.php3">intereviewed Gordon Wrinn</a>.  Gordon is, as you know, Verant's Internet Relations Manager.  The questions mainly center around Monks, but regardless of your class it's a good read.  Here's an excerpt: <br><UL><b><br>S: C) Is there any hopes that, through tinting or altogether different textures, the elite monk gear (read: Shiverback) will ever look different from the newbie gear (read: cured silk)? <P></b><br>Abashi: It's possible, but keep in mind that EQ proper still needs to adhere to the same system requirements as it does now. We'll have to see how much of our discretionary pool is left after the implementation of the Iksar skins before we can commit to anything along these lines. As far as tinting goes, we do use it quite a bit currently. However, though the Monk gear (read: shirt) looks like a bare chest with a small piece of cloth over it, it is actually a complete texture covering the whole chest. Tinting this item would in fact tint what looks like bare skin, not just the representation of cloth or leather straps over it. <br></UL>Thanks Rich!
